    "energy conversion systems , including heat engines and refrigerators , encompass a broad variety of devices which find widespread uses in the domestic , industrial and academic domains .",
    "design optimization of such systems is crucial for their implementation to be cost - efficient , and the determination of general performance benchmarks to assess their ` optimality ' , is a very active research area @xcite .",
    "a familiar example of heat engine is a nuclear power station .",
    "the relevant figure of merit to benchmark its optimality is the output power rather than the efficiency of energy conversion @xcite : in fact , capital costs are by far the dominant contribution to the price of the kwh , while the nuclear fuel itself is comparatively inexpensive .",
    "hence , ideally , a nuclear energy station will be designed to operate at the maximum power output @xmath0 corresponding to some heat input @xmath1 , which defines an _ optimal efficiency _ @xmath2 .    as a working assumption ,",
    "one may treat a nuclear power station as a perfect carnot engine running between heat reservoirs at temperatures @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the effective temperature of the working fluid at the hot end of the cycle .",
    "this amounts to saying that the leading source of irreversibility in atomic power generation is the imperfect thermal contact of the working fluid with the reactor , to the point that internal friction and heat leaks may be completely disregarded .",
    "this is known as _",
    "approximation @xcite .",
    "if one further assumes a simple newtonian heat transfer law for the heat current @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a constant , then the effective temperature maximizing the power may be found to be the geometric mean of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , the optimal efficiency reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ultimate carnot efficiency @xcite .",
    "this formula , introduced by yvon @xcite and novikov @xcite in the mid 1950s in the context of atomic energy generation , was re - derived twenty years later by curzon and ahlborn @xcite in their 1975 seminal paper . in principle",
    ", it should be nothing but a crude approximation to optimality , but it turns out to be in good agreement with the observed efficiency of actual thermal power plants , and proves to be remarkably independent of the specific design @xcite .",
    "indeed , it agrees with the optimal efficiency of any engine operating close to equilibrium @xcite , and applies quite generally to symmetric low - dissipation engines @xcite , even if these are realized on a quantum mechanical support @xcite .",
    "eq .   is , therefore , a useful design guideline , as it reliably benchmarks the optimal operation of a large class of heat engines .",
    "besides , it is clearly model - independent .    in the last few decades , many attempts have been made to answer the fundamental question of whether a similar model - independent benchmark can be obtained for optimal cooling . that would certainly be very useful in the design optimization of refrigerators , but unfortunately the straightforward endoreversible approach together with the assumption of a linear heat transfer law does not help in this case : the cooling rate @xmath11 , which replaces @xmath12 as figure of merit , is maximal only at vanishing _ coefficient of performance _ ( cop ) @xmath13 .",
    "this problem might be circumvented by resorting to alternative heat transfer laws , though these usually lead to involved ( non - universal ) formulas for the optimal cop , explicitly depending on phenomenological heat conductivities @xcite .",
    "benchmarks analogous to eq .",
    ", may still be obtained by retaining the simple newtonian ansatz and changing instead the definition of ` optimality ' .",
    "practical considerations may advise e.g.  to pay the same attention to the cop and the cooling rate , so that the meaningful figure of merit would be @xmath14 rather than @xmath11 alone . in this case",
    ", one would find an optimal performance of @xmath15 @xcite , which holds in fact for any symmetric low - dissipation carnot refrigerator @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath16 stands for the carnot cop .",
    "other criteria for optimality @xcite would lead , of course , to different performance benchmarks as figure of merit , and a simple linear model for the heat currents @xcite .",
    "generally , this also leads to model - dependent benchmarks . ] .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the cop at maximum cooling rate for endoreversible quantum refrigerators , generally modelled as _ tricycles _",
    "we find that the details of the system - bath interaction mechanism place a tight upper bound on the cooling performance , which automatically precludes the derivation of any model - independent benchmarks .",
    "we then look into the paradigmatic case of a three - level compression refrigerator @xcite operating between unstructured bosonic heat baths , to obtain a simple closed expression for @xmath17 , which is further shown to bound and closely reproduce the optimal cop of _ any _ multi - stage endoreversible refrigerator within the same dissipative scheme .",
    "our analysis unveils fundamental differences between heat engines and refrigerators from the point of view of their optimal performance , and highlights the key importance of reservoir engineering in the optimization of technologically relevant quantum models .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : the generic template of a quantum tricycle is briefly described sec .",
    "then , our main result , concerning the non - universality of the optimal cooling performance is derived in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and illustrated with a simple example in sec .",

    "a generic energy conversion device may be thought of as a stationary black box in simultaneous thermal contact with three heat reservoirs at different temperatures @xmath18 or , alternatively , with two heat reservoirs @xmath19 and a work repository ( @xmath20 ) , which , in principle , accounts for the case of a heat engine or a power - driven refrigerator ( we shall elaborate more on this equivalence in an example below ) .",
    "this template , termed ` tricycle ' @xcite , is suitable to describe averaged finite - time cycles or continuous processes , and is represented by the triple @xmath21 of steady - state rates of incoming ( positive ) and outgoing ( negative ) energy flow in the system through each of the thermal contact ports . in order to comply with the first and second laws of thermodynamics",
    ", these must satisfy    [ thermo_laws ] @xmath22    if the black box encloses a quantum system , thermal contact with the heat reservoir may be selectively established through filters at frequencies @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "this is the distinctive feature of a _ quantum tricycle _",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in absence of heat leaks or internal friction ,",
    "a quantum tricycle exchanges quanta with all three baths at a single stationary rate @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 , with @xmath27 ( in what follows @xmath28 ) .",
    "thence , the fulfilment of the first law in eq .   demands to tune the filters in resonance so that @xmath29 .",
    "such ` ideal ' devices have two complementary modes of operation compatible with eq .  : the absorption / compression refrigerator @xmath30 and the heat transformer / heat engine @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "let us consider for instance a compression refrigerator @xmath32 at fixed @xmath33 , for which the inequality may be rewritten as @xmath34 .",
    "as @xmath35 , the contact ports simultaneously reach local thermal equilibrium with their respective heat reservoirs , and the cop is maximized @xmath36 @xcite . in general , however , the effective temperatures @xmath37 defined from the stationary state of the contacts , do not coincide with the corresponding equilibrium values @xmath38 , and the cop is strictly smaller than @xmath39 .    the irreversibility hindering the cooling performance of ideal quantum tricycles might be thus understood as if only arising from imperfect thermal contact with the heat baths .",
    "it is in this sense that we refer to them as ` endoreversible ' .",
    "alternatively , ideal energy conversion systems may be tagged ` strongly coupled ' @xcite , referring to the fact that their energy fluxes remain at all times proportional to each other .",
    "this is a necessary prerequisite for any device to achieve maximum efficiency , although at vanishing energy - conversion rates @xcite .",
    "next , we shall tune the frequency filters of a generic endoreversible power - driven tricycle in the refrigerator configuration , so as to maximize its cooling power in search for the optimal cop .    from eq .",
    "it follows that the entropy production can be written as @xmath40 , where the fluxes are @xmath41 , and their conjugate thermodynamic forces are given by @xmath42 .",
    "note that refrigeration is achieved whenever @xmath43 , according to eq .  .",
    "even though we shall concentrate on the dependence of the flux on the thermodynamic forces , it will generally be a function of other independent dimensionless combinations of parameters , describing the system - bath interactions and the spectrum of thermal fluctuations of the heat reservoirs .",
    "the cold heat current writes as @xmath44 and its local maximization with respect to @xmath45 at fixed @xmath46 , follows from @xmath47    little more can be said without disclosing the full hamiltonian of the tricycle , except if one restricts to a certain regime of parameters . here",
    ", we shall take the high - temperature limit ( @xmath48 ) , where e.g.  symmetric quantum heat engines are known to operate at the yvon - novikov - curzon - ahlborn efficiency @xcite , and where different models of absorption refrigerators achieve their maximal performance @xcite .",
    "we shall thus approximate @xmath49 around @xmath50 , retaining only the first non - zero term in its taylor expansion @xmath51 and express the optimal ` cold force ' as @xmath52 , to first order in @xmath46 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath53 may be obtained by substituting the approximated current of eq .   into eq .  , and will thus depend explicitly on the partial derivatives of the stationary heat current evaluated in @xmath50 .",
    "noting that the cop of an endoreversible refrigerator writes as @xmath54 the optimal performance , normalized by @xmath39 , is finally @xmath55 here , @xmath53 must be positive and upper - bounded by @xmath56 , so that @xmath57 . in general , it will be a function of parameters such as the dissipation rate ( @xmath58 ) , ohmicity ( @xmath59 ) , high frequency cutoff ( @xmath60 ) , dimensionality of the baths ( @xmath61 ) or their equilibrium temperatures ( through @xmath39 ) .",
    "thus , and unlike eq .  , @xmath62 converges to @xmath63 as @xmath64 , rather than to a _",
    "universal _ constant value .",
    "the above discussion can be compared to the one done in ref .",
    "@xcite for a generic heat engine in the linear regime : there , the first order term in the expansion of the optimal force @xmath65 ( in that case , around @xmath66 ) contributed to @xmath67 with a universal constant value of @xmath68 , while the second order term added a correction , explicitly involving the first and second order partial derivatives of the heat current .",
    "in contrast , as we have just seen , the optimal cooling performance is already non - universal to the lowest order in @xmath46 .    in order to intuitively understand this fundamental difference between engines and refrigerators , we remark that the useful effect in a heat engine is sought at the interface of the working substance with an infinite - temperature heat reservoir , implying that the corresponding contact transitions will be saturated regardless of the details of the system - bath interaction . on the contrary , in a refrigerator",
    ", the useful effect takes place in the interface with a bath at some finite temperature .",
    "therefore , it is not so surprising that the spectral properties of the environmental fluctuations play a relevant role in establishing the optimal cooling performance .",
    "indeed , the situation resembles that of the maximization of the cooling power of endoreversible ( ` classical ' ) refrigerators , for which the optimal performance is generally set by the heat conductivities , and depends critically on the specific heat transfer law assumed @xcite .",
    "finally , let us comment on the optimal cop in the complementary limit of @xmath69 , that is , in the linear regime .",
    "close to equilibrium , we may assume a linear relation between fluxes @xmath70 and forces @xmath71 , such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the onsager coefficients @xmath74 satisfy @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "here , the parameter @xmath79 is stands for the tightness of the coupling between input and output fluxes @xcite , where @xmath80 implies ` endoreversiblity '",
    ". we can maximize again @xmath81 in @xmath45 for fixed @xmath46 , obtaining @xmath82 .",
    "this yields an optimal cop of @xmath83 which converges to @xmath84 as @xmath69 .",
    "hence , the ratio @xmath62 simply vanishes close to equilibrium , _ regardless _ of the magnitude of @xmath71 and the details system - bath coupling .",
    "in order to get a closed expression for @xmath85 , specific instances have to be considered . here",
    "we focus on a simple and paradigmatic endoreversible device , such as a three - level maser @xcite subject to a weak periodic driving , in contact with unstructured bosonic baths ( i.e.  characterized by a flat spectral density ) in @xmath86 dimensions .",
    "its hamiltonian writes as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the intensity of the driving at the power input transition @xmath89 .",
    "the remaining ones ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , are linearly connected with the ` hot ' and ` cold ' heat reservoirs , through terms of the form @xmath92 , where    @xmath93    the constants @xmath94 indicate the intensity of the coupling between the mode @xmath95 of bath @xmath96 and the corresponding contact transition of the working substance , and @xmath97 stands for the dissipation strength @xcite .",
    "we shall assume very weak dissipation ( i.e. @xmath98 ) and parameters well into the quantum optical regime , so as to consistently derive a quantum master equation like @xmath99 , with dissipators @xmath100 of the lindblad - gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan type @xcite .",
    "their explicit form is given in appendix [ appendix ] .    the non - equilibrium _",
    "limit cycle _ state @xmath101 may be found from @xmath102 , while the corresponding ( time - averaged ) heat currents are @xcite @xmath103 the states @xmath104 are the unique local stationary states of each dissipator , i.e. @xmath105 .    in general , a power - driven three - level maser does not realize a tricycle as it features closed performance characteristics , which is a clear indicator of irreversibility @xcite .",
    "we shall take , however , the limit of weak driving , i.e. @xmath106 , in which the time averaged limit flux @xmath25 reads @xmath107 the excitation and relaxation rates @xmath108 are given by @xmath109 $ ] and @xmath110 , with @xmath111 . here",
    ", @xmath86 stands for the physical dimensionality of bath @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "taking now the high - temperature limit would result in @xmath112 and @xmath113 , so that @xmath114 we shall discard the second term in the denominator of eq .   by assuming that the coupling to the entropy sink is much stronger than the interaction with the cold bath ( i.e. @xmath115 ) . setting up a comparatively efficient heat rejection mechanism is indeed very important for the maximization of the stationary flux in a refrigerator , which justifies this assumption as a first step towards optimality .",
    "nonetheless , noting that @xmath116 , we see that this would be justified anyway , as long as @xmath64 .",
    "the stationary flux may be thus written as @xmath117 with @xmath118 . from here",

    "therefore , it should be thought - of just as a reasonable approximation to their generic behaviour . on a second thought",
    ", however , the excellent agreement observed may not be so surprising , provided that the optimal performance is set by the dissipative scheme alone . solving for the limit cycle of a ( weakly - driven ) compression tree - level maser in different types of environment would be thus enough to come up with generally valid benchmarks for any endoreversible refrigerator in each case .",
    "this is one of the take - home messages of the present paper .",
    "the optimal performance of single and multi - stage quantum absorption refrigerators is indeed known to be limited by @xmath127 when attached to unstructured baths in @xmath61 dimensions , with a saturation occurring precisely in the limit of large temperatures @xcite .",

    "note , however that eq .",
    "( [ perf_bound ] ) should not be expected to hold quantitatively ( and not even as a qualitative indicator of optimality ) when moving away from endoreversibility .",
    "to summarize and conclude , we have shown from first principles how the cop at maximum cooling power of endoreversible quantum tricycles is _ not _ universal in the high - temperature limit , but fundamentally constrained by the details of their interaction with the external heat reservoirs . for quantum refrigerators coupled to unstructured bosonic baths",
    ", we obtained a compact expression for their optimal performance , only dependent on the carnot cop _ and _ the dimensionality of the baths .",
    "our results highlight the importance of reservoir engineering @xcite in the design of quantum thermal devices : while squeezed - thermal and other types of engineered non - equilibrium environments are known to be capable of enhancing both the performance and power of heat engines and quantum refrigerators @xcite , the exploration of more exotic and highly tunable reservoirs , such as cold atomic gases @xcite , might bring about new possibilities for the physical realization of super - efficient thermodynamic cycles , especially interesting for practical applications to quantum technologies .",

    "in what follows , we shall derive a quantum master equation for a three - level maser weakly coupled to two unstructured bosonic reservoirs in @xmath61 dimensions , and driven by a periodic perturbation .",
    "as already stated in the main text , the full hamiltonian of system and baths ( excluding their mutual interactions ) is given by @xmath129 while the system - bath coupling writes as @xmath130 recall that the ` thermal contact ' operators @xmath131 were just @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
