    "studying regions close to the galactic plane in the optical is difficult due both due to dust obscuration and source confusion .",
    "it was only recently feast et al .",
    "( 2014 ) reported the discovery of five classical cepheid variables at distances of 13 - 22 kpc from the galactic center , towards the galactic bulge , that may be associated with the flared atomic hydrogen disk of our galaxy .",
    "two classical cepheid variables at 11 kpc close to the plane of the milky way have been recently uncovered from vvv data ( dekany et al . 2015 ) , that indicates an underlying young star cluster .",
    "searches for dwarf galaxies in the optical have primarily targeted high latitudes ( mcconnachie 2012 ) .",
    "the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy is the closest known dwarf galaxy to the plane , at a latitude of @xmath5 ( ibata et al .",
    "the dearth of milky way satellites at low latitudes ( mateo 1998 ; mcconnachie 2012 ) is underscored by simulations that suggest that there may be massive , nearly dark satellites that have not yet been discovered ( boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2011 ) . not only dwarf galaxies , but even bright spiral galaxies are not easily seen if they are hidden behind the obscuring column of dust and gas of the galactic disk ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "mining data from deep infrared surveys of the galactic plane may well uncover new dwarf galaxies and halo sub - structure .",
    "this would alleviate several outstanding problems in near - field cosmology .",
    "the `` missing satellites problem '' , or the overabundance of dwarf galaxies in cosmological simulations relative to the number of observed dwarf galaxies in and around the local group ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the `` too big to fail problem '' , wherein there are too few massive satellites in the milky way relative to cosmological simulations ( boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "2011 ) are two such outstanding problems .",
    "yet another is the ostensibly anisotropic distribution of the milky way satellites ( kroupa et al .",
    "these discepancies may be resolved by a more complete inventory of the structure of our galaxy at low latitudes .",
    "we have searched for distant stars close to the galactic plane using near - infrared data from the eso public survey vista variables of the via lactea ( vvv ) ( minniti et al .",
    "2011 ; s12 ) , targeting the vvv disk area , which covers galactic longitudes @xmath6 within galactic latitudes @xmath7 .",
    "the vvv survey is an ongoing 5-band photometric survey in the z ( 0.87@xmath8 ) , y ( 1.02@xmath8 ) , j ( 1.25 @xmath8 ) , h ( 1.64 @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( 2.14 @xmath8 ) bands ( s12 ) , and is multi - epoch in the @xmath9 band , with approximately 30 - 40 epochs per star across the vvv disk area at the time of writing . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we review the methods we used to identify cepheid variables , and present the distance and extinction values .",
    "we discuss possible interpretations and conclude in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the infrared photometry is from the vvv survey , which is based on aperture photometry computed on the individual tile images ( s12 ) .",
    "each of the sources was observed with a median exposure time of @xmath10 s per pixel , depending on the position in the tile ( each exposure is @xmath11 s long , and most of the area in a tile is a combination of two pointings ) .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the vvv data using aperture photometry is @xmath12 mag in most fields ( s12 ) .",
    "a particular pointing is called a `` tile '' , covers @xmath13 square degree , and contains approximately @xmath14 stars . as a preliminary search",
    ", we examined the disk area of the vvv survey by applying color cuts that correspond to distant ( @xmath15 ) red - clump stars .",
    "red - clump stars have been shown to be good distance indicators ( alves 2000 ; paczynski & stanek 1998 ) . given the mean values of intrinsic near - infrared colors for red - clump stars in the milky way disk and the cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) extinction law , we used the distance modulus noted in minniti et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , which gives a color cut of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( which corresponds to distances in excess of @xmath4 60 kpc ) . using this color cut",
    ", we saw an excess of distant red - clump stars at @xmath18 .",
    "we defer a detailed analysis of the red - clump stars and other stellar populations to a future paper .",
    "we carried out a search for variable stars , restricting our search to faint variables , with mean @xmath19 mag , and periods greater than three days .",
    "we examined the variability data in five tiles close to galactic longitude @xmath20 and searched six comparison tiles at other locations in the vvv disk area .",
    "we found four cepheid variables at @xmath20 at an average distance of @xmath4 90 kpc , and none in the other tiles .",
    "the survey strategy ensures that the tiles in the vvv disk area have similar number of observations and limiting magnitude ( s12 ) . while the control on the cadence is limited ( saito et al .",
    "2013 ) , we have checked that there is no significant difference in the cadence for the @xmath20 tiles relative to the rest of the disk area , i.e. , the region at @xmath20 is not unique in terms of the way it was observed .    in identifying cepheids , we employed several successive tests .",
    "the first two tests are based on the statistical significance of the highest peak in the lomb - scargle periodogram , and the uncertainty of the period , respectively .",
    "these two tests ensure that we have identified sources of a given pulsation period , and that there is a small uncertainty in the period that we derive . for the final cut ,",
    "we quantitatively assess the shapes of the light curves by calculating the fourier parameters of the sources , as well as the skewness and acuteness parameters , and visually inspect the light curves .",
    "a given tile is searched using the lomb - scargle algorithm ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) , and periodograms are constructed for every source .",
    "the statistical significance of the amplitude of the largest peak in the periodogram ( scargle 1982 ) corresponds to a false alarm probability @xmath21 . claiming the detection of the signal",
    "if the amplitude exceeds the threshold value , one can expect to be wrong a fraction @xmath21 of the time .",
    "alternately , the statistical significance level of the detection is @xmath22 , and this quantity is listed in table 1 .",
    "for the first test , we require @xmath23 15 mag to search for faint variables , and set the minimum and maximum period range in our variability search between 3 - 50 days .",
    "to pass the first test , sources have to satisfy the following conditions : 1 ) the period corresponding to the maximum in the lomb - scargle periodogram is greater than three days , 2 ) the maximum in the lomb - scargle periodogram exceeds 90-th pericentile for the significance level , 3 ) if there are other maxima in the periodogram that are at 90-th percentile or higher , the periods corresponding to these maxima must differ by a factor of two or less",
    ". the last condition amounts to requiring a clean periodogram without spuriously large multiple peaks .    in the second test",
    ", we assess the quality of the light curves of the variables that pass the tests above with a parametric bootstrap . assuming a gaussian distribution of errors",
    ", we sample the distribution one thousand times to derive the distribution of periods for each source , which is similar to prior work ( klein et al .",
    "2012 ; klein et al .",
    "2014 ) on rr lyrae stars .",
    "if the mean of the period distribution agrees to within 20 % of the period calculated from the raw data , and if the mean of the period distribution @xmath24 the standard deviation still exceeds three days , we consider the period distribution to be sufficiently well constrained .",
    "the goal of this second cut is to select sources that have a small uncertainty in the derived period , given the photometric errors .",
    "the lomb - scargle algorithm allows us to derive the period and its statistical signficance , but not the uncertainty in the derived period .",
    "if the width of the histogram that gives the distribution of periods from the bootstrap calculation is narrow , the uncertainty in the derived period is low . for the sources that pass the above tests , we fit the light curves with a fourier series ( kovacs & kupi 2007 ) .",
    "the fourier parameters are similar to the light curves of classical cepheids for @xmath25 days observed in the k - band ( persson et al .",
    "2004 ; bhardwaj et al .",
    "the light curves of cepheid variables in the optical are different in shape and amplitude from the light curves of cepheid variables in the k - band ( matsunaga et al .",
    "2013 ; bhardwaj et al . 2015 ) , and our comparison here is to the observed light curves of classical cepheid variables in the k - band .",
    "the cepheids we list here pass all of the automated and visual checks . because of this multi - tiered , conservative approach , the light curve analysis is time consuming , but allows us to derive accurate distances .",
    "it is worth noting that in addition to lower extinctions in the infrared relative to the optical , another advantage of infrared photometry of cepheids is that it is minimally affected by metallicity variations ( bono et al .",
    "2010 ; freedman et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the tiles close to longitude @xmath20 produce a significantly larger number of variables that pass the first of our tests than the other six tiles we examined ( at @xmath26 ) .",
    "figure 2 of s12 depicts the vvv survey area .",
    "the number of sources in tiles d027",
    ", d065 , d103 , and d141 that are centered at @xmath27 and extend upwards in latitude ( s12 ) , produce @xmath28 sources that pass our first cut .",
    "in contrast , the average number that pass the first cut from the comparison tiles is @xmath4 60 . if we consider this background number to be the mean of a poisson distribution , and randomly sample a poisson distribution with this mean value , values in excess of 100 are above 5-@xmath29 , i.e. , they are statistically extremely unlikely to occur by chance .",
    "figure [ f : comb ] shows the number of sources that pass the first of our tests as a function of longitude ( the value at @xmath27 is an average over latitude ) , as well as a function of the total number of variable stars in the tile .",
    "while the number of sources that pass the first of our tests has some correlation with the number of variable stars ( which is not unexpected ) , the region at @xmath27 is a clear outlier . in some tiles centered at @xmath27 ,",
    "there were a significant number that passed our automated and visual analysis of the light curves , but did not pass our visual inspection of the images , due to the possibility of spikes or blending .",
    "the number of cepheid variables that we report here from the final cut is very likely an underestimate .",
    "3 days , @xmath30 ) is shown as a function of longitude in the top panel , and as a function of the total number of variable stars in the tile ( normalized to one million ) in the bottom panel .",

    "table 1 summarizes the derived distances and other parameters for the cepheids .",
    "to estimate the dust extinction from the excess color , we use the quasi - simultaneous single epoch vvv measurements in the @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath9 bands ( @xmath4 190 s between each band ) .",
    "the near - infrared amplitudes of classical cepheids are relatively small ( persson et al . 2004 ) and as such an estimate of the dust extinction from the single epoch measurements of the colour should be sufficient .",
    "the average extinction - corrected @xmath33 colours of the cepheids is @xmath4 0.4 , which is consistent with the colors of short - period classical cepheids ( persson et al . 2004 ) in the lmc .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     short - period ( @xmath4 day ) close contact eclipsing binaries like w ursa majoris stars can mimic the sinusoidal light curves of rr lyrae stars , which have periods of @xmath4 day ( rucinski 1993 ) , but is less of a concern for long - period variables .",
    "to ensure that the shapes of the light curves are quantitatively similar to classical cepheids , we compute their fourier parameters , as well as the skewness and acuteness parameter , and visually inspect all the light curves .",
    "we have computed the fourier parameters of our sources ( figure [ f : fourier ] ) , following kovacs & kupi ( 2007 ) . out to fourth - order the fourier series is expressed as :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the light curve , @xmath36 is the period , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the amplitudes and phases respectively .",
    "the top panel shows @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the bottom panel shows @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "eclipsing binaries have @xmath43 and @xmath44 values close to 2@xmath45 or zero , which reflects their symmetric variations ( matsunaga et al .",
    "thus , the fourier parameters of our sources indicate that they are not eclipsing binaries .",
    "bhardwaj et al .",
    "( 2015 ) provides a compilation of the fourier parameters of a large number of galactic and lmc type i cepheids across a range of wavelengths .",
    "this work shows the differences in the shape of the light curve in the k - band relative to the i - band , as well as differences between the k - band light curves of cepheids in the galaxy and in the lmc .",
    "we have overplotted in figure [ f : fourier ] the fourier parameters of type ii cepheids in the milky way ( matsunaga et al .",
    "these type ii cepheids tend to have lower @xmath44 values than classical , type i cepheids , but there is scatter in the fourier parameters derived from k - band light curves .     90 kpc ( marked `` this paper '' ) , eclipsing binaries ( matsunaga et al .",
    "2013 ) ( marked `` eb '' ) , and type ii cepheids ( matsunaga et al . 2013 ) ( marked `` type ii '' ) .",
    "[ f : fourier ] ]    the shape of the light curve can be further quantified by the skewness ( @xmath46 ) and acuteness ( @xmath47 ) parameters : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the phases corresponding to the minimum and maximum of the rising branch , and @xmath51 is therefore the phase duration of the rising branch , and @xmath52 is the full width at half maximum of the light curve .",
    "bhardwaj et al .",
    "( 2015 ) demonstrated that the skewness parameter derived from i - band light curves is significantly higher than k - band light curves .",
    "the average skewness parameter of our sources is @xmath4 0.63 and the average acuteness parameter is @xmath4 0.8 , which is comparable to classical cepheids observed in the k - band ( bhardwaj et al . 2015 ) .",
    "by employing a series of successive tests to determine the periods of variable stars , the uncertainty in their periods , and a quantitative assessment of the light curve shape , we have found four cepheid variables within an angular extent of one degree centered at galactic longitude of @xmath0 and galactic latitude of @xmath1 , at an average distance of 90 kpc .",
    "these successive tests are not satisfied at any of the other locations where we searched for cepheid variables .",
    "spectroscopic observations would be useful to confirm the spectral type and determine a radial velocity .",
    "type ii cepheids that are part of the galactic halo are not expected to be clustered within a degree , which is what we see here .",
    "type ii cepheids that are part of a dwarf galaxy can be clustered .",
    "there are many more type i , classical cepheids than type ii cepheids ; the ogle survey has detected 3361 type i , classical cepheids in the lmc , and 197 type ii cepheids ( soszynski et al .",
    "2008 ; soszynki et al .",
    "unless this object is as massive and extended as the lmc , one would expect that these sources are more likely to be type i rather than type ii cepheids . if they are type ii cepheids , they would be at an average distance of @xmath4 50 kpc ( matsunaga et al .",
    "2013 ) , and such a concentration of type ii cepheids ( which are very rare ) is unexpected beyond the edge of the galactic disk .",
    "therefore , on the basis of the fourier parameters , skewness and acuteness parameters , and their angular concentration , we conclude these sources are type i cepheids",
    ".    earlier work ( chakrabarti & blitz 2009 ) predicted that the observed perturbations in the atomic hydrogen disk of our galaxy ( levine , blitz & heiles 2006 ) are due to a recent ( 300 myr years ago ) interaction with a dwarf satellite galaxy that is one - hundredth the mass of our galaxy , currently at a distance of 90 kpc from the galactic center , close to the plane , and within galactic longitudes of @xmath53 ( chakrabarti & blitz 2011 ) . this methodology was applied to spiral galaxies with known , tidally dominant optical companions to provide a proof of principle of the method ( chakrabarti et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "there are no known dwarf galaxies that have tidal debris at this location .",
    "the tidal debris of the sgr dwarf does not not extend to within @xmath4 twenty - five degrees of galactic longitude of @xmath54 ( carlin et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the magellanic stream does not extend to within @xmath4 40 degrees of this region ( putman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the canis major overdensity was identified as an excess of m - giant stars from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) at @xmath55 , at a distance of @xmath4 7 kpc from the sun ( martin et al .",
    "its proximity to the milky way indicates that this overdensity is also unlikely to be associated with the cepheids we report here .",
    "these are the most distant cepheid variables close to the plane of our galaxy discovered to date .",
    "the fact that the cepheids that we detect are at an average distance of 90 kpc , highly clustered in angle ( within one degree ) and in distance ( within 20 % of the mean value of 90 kpc ) , is difficult to explain without invoking the hypothesis of these stars being associated with a dwarf galaxy , which may be more extended in latitude than can be determined from the vvv survey alone .",
    "constraining the structure of this object should be possible with future deeper observations .",
