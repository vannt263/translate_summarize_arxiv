    "the broadening of exciton emission lines due to electron - exciton collisions was first observed in bulk gaas @xcite . an experimental comparison between exciton - electron and exciton - exciton scattering mechanisms in bulk gaas @xcite and in gaas quantum wells ( qw s )",
    "@xcite showed that the exciton - electron scattering efficiency is an order of magnitude larger than that of the exciton - exciton process .",
    "both scattering processes are enhanced for the 2d excitons as compared to bulk excitons .",
    "theoretical calculations of elastic and inelastic exciton - electron scattering were reported for bulk semiconductors @xcite and for qw s @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical treatment of the latter neglected the exchange term which was shown recently to be the dominant term in qw s @xcite .",
    "the existence of the negatively charged exciton @xmath1 ( trion ) was first proposed by lampert @xcite as the semiconductor analogue of the hydrogen ion .",
    "due to their confinement in the growth direction , 2d trions have a binding energy which is an order - of - magnitude larger than that of the bulk trions @xcite .",
    "this fact facilitated the observation of trions in cdte @xcite and in gaas @xcite qw s containing a low - density two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "theoretical calculations of the binding energy of both negatively ( @xmath1 ) and positively ( @xmath4 ) charged excitons were performed using various trial functions , showing that only the singlet state is bound @xcite .",
    "particular attention was devoted to the modification of the trion s properties in the presence of strong magnetic fields . in this limit ,",
    "the @xmath1 binding energy is increased , and the electron spin triplet state becomes bound as well @xcite .",
    "it was also observed that the dependence on the magnetic field of the @xmath1 and @xmath4 binding energies , as well as their zeeman splitting , differ drastically ( while being nearly identical at zero magnetic field ) @xcite .    while these aspects of the trions where extensively studied , there are very few reports on their broadening mechanisms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical model for the scattering of both neutral and charged excitons with electrons in qw s .",
    "this paper continues our previous work which introduced neutral excitons elastic scattering with electrons in the context of cavity polaritons @xcite .",
    "here we extend our model , to incorporate both excitons and trions , taking into account elastic and inelastic scattering processes .",
    "the model is based on calculating the exciton - electron direct and exchange interaction matrix elements , from which we derive the exciton scattering rates .",
    "these are integrated over all final excitonic states , resulting in the exciton linewidth due to scattering , as a function of its initial momentum ( or energy ) .",
    "a major difference between the exciton and trion scattering lies in the charge of the latter , which results in a divergence of its matrix elements in the limit of zero transferred momentum .",
    "this divergence , originating from the infinite range of the coulomb potential , is treated by applying the lindhard model for the potential screening .",
    "the screening action complicates the trion linewidth dependence on the electron density ; thus , while for electron densities larger than @xmath5 the trion linewidth due to electron scattering in a gaas qw at @xmath3 is comparable to that of the neutral exciton , for a very dilute 2deg ( @xmath6 ) the trion linewidth becomes roughly an order - of - magnitude larger than that of the neutral exciton .",
    "inelastic scattering is also much more efficient in the trion s case , due to its smaller binding energy .",
    "the calculated reflection spectra are obtained by considering the three electronic excitations of the system , namely , the heavy - hole and light - hole 1s neutral excitons , and the heavy - hole 1s charged exciton ( trion ) , with the appropriate oscillator strengths . a qualitative validation of our calculations is given by considering photoluminesence ( pl ) measurements that were done on a mixed type i  type ii gaas / alas qw ( mtqw ) structure @xcite .",
