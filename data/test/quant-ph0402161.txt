    "recently , much attention has been paid to the topic of quantum games @xcite , which is forming a new area of study within quantum information and applications of quantum theory . in additional to their own intrinsic interest , quantum games open a new window for exploring the fascinating world of quantum information and quantum mechanics . actually , various problems in quantum information and computation , such as quantum cryptography , quantum cloning , quantum algorithms , can be regarded as quantum games @xcite . the quantum prisoner s dilemma @xcite is a famous two player quantum game which is quantization of the so - called prisoner s dilemma .",
    "eisert and coworkers @xcite showed that with proper quantum strategies , the paradox in the classical two - player prisoner s dilemma can be solved under the maximal entangled states , and discussed the generalized quantum game of the quantum prisoner s dilemma where the players share a nonmaximally entangled states .",
    "then du and coworkers @xcite experimentally realized the quantum game on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer .",
    "quantum games with multi - players @xcite have also been studied to some extent .",
    "it has been found that through properly choosing quantum strategies , the players may gain more payoffs in the quantum case than in classical case , and quantum games can exhibit certain forms of nonclassical equilibria since quantum entanglement is introduced .",
    "as well known , optical realization is one of the most effective methods for quantum information processing .",
    "the important experimental implementation of quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite and quantum computation @xcite , is completed in quantum optical systems which generally consist of beam splitters , phase shifters , mirrors , kerr medium , and so on . in this paper",
    "we add quantum games to the list .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present an optical realization of the quantum prisoner s dilemma which involves nonmaximally entangled states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review the quantum game of the quantum prisoner s dilemma with nonmaximally entangled states . in sec .",
    "iii and iv , we present optical preparation of the initial state and optical realization of the strategic operations in the quantum game . finally , we summarize our results in sec . vi .",
    "before going into the optical realization , let us briefly review the quantum game of the two - player quantum prisoner s dilemma with nonmaximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "there are two players , and the players have two possible strategies : cooperate ( @xmath0 ) and defect ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the payoff table for the players is shown in table i. classically the dominant strategy for both players is to defect ( the nash equilibrium ) since no player can improve his / her payoff by unilaterally changing his / her own strategy , even though the pareto optimal is for both players to cooperate .",
    "this is the dilemma . in the quantum version involving nonmaximally entangled states , ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the game is modelled by two qubits , one for each player , with the basis states denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the physical model of the quantum game consists of three ingredients : a entangling source of two qubits , a set of physical instruments that enables the players to manipulate his or her own qubits in a strategic manner , and a physical measurement device which determines the players pay of from the outstate of the two qubits . starting with the product state @xmath4 of the two players one acts on the state with the entangling gate @xmath5 to obtain an entangled state given by @xmath6 measures the entanglement of the initial state , it changes from @xmath7 ( no entanglement ) to @xmath8 ( maximal entanglement ) .",
    "the two players now act with local unitary operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 on their qubits .",
    "finally , the disentangling gate @xmath11 is carried out and the system is measured in the computational basis , giving rise to one of the four outcomes @xmath4 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . if one allows quantum strategies of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the two classical strategies @xmath18 and @xmath19 is correspond to @xmath20 and @xmath21 given by @xmath22    it is worthwhile to mention that eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is a restriction of the possible unitary strategies .",
    "it is a subset of the possible strategies .",
    "this subset is being chosen because of the ease of physical implementation .    .payoff",
    "matrix for the prisoner s dilemma .",
    "the first entry in the parenthesis denotes the payoff of alice and the second number is bob s payoff [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     du and coworkers @xcite showed that the game exhibits an intriguing structure as a function of the amount of entanglement with two thresholds @xmath23 and @xmath24 which separate a classical region , an intermediate region , and a fully quantum region when @xmath25 changes from @xmath7 ( no entanglement ) to @xmath8 ( maximal entanglement ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the classical region in which the quantum game behaves classically , i.e. , the only nash equilibrium is @xmath27 and the payoffs for both players are one , which is the same as in the classical game .",
    "the intermediate region is given by @xmath28 .",
    "in this region the quantum game can not resolve the dilemma .",
    "the region of @xmath29 is the fully quantum region in which a unique and new nash equilibrium is only a nash equilibriumin the space of strategies given by eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , which has the property of being pareto optimal . in the next two sections",
    ", we will give rise to optical realization of the players strategic operations and the @xmath5-gate operation , respectively .",
    "in this section we propose a method to realize the player s strategy of the quantum prisoner s dilemma with nonmaximally entangled state only by 50:50 lossless beam splitters , phase shifters and mirrors , which are easy to operate for players .",
    "a typical two - mode mixer that preserves the total number of photons in the mode pair , is a lossless beam splitter with transparency @xmath30 . denoting the input annihilation operators as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the output s as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the beam splitter transform the input @xmath31 and @xmath32 into the output @xmath33 and @xmath34 as following @xmath35 where the transparency @xmath36 .",
    "this is one ways to relate the input state to the output state .",

    "the rotations around the @xmath52 and @xmath53 axes by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , can be realized by the following form @xmath56 where the rotations around the @xmath52 and @xmath53 axes are defined by @xcite @xmath57 , \\\\",

    "it consists of two 50:50 beam splitters , two mirrors , and four phase shifters . among these phase shifters ,",
    "ps2 acts conjugate to ps3 and ps1 acts conjugate to ps4 .",
    "the two beam splitters and two mirrors along with ps2 and ps3 realize the @xmath58.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    then the unitary operator of the player s strategy shown in eq.([1 ] ) , can be realized using the following identity : @xmath59 and the experiment setup is the combination of the beam splitters , phase shifters and mirrors shown in fig.[cong : strategy ] .",
    "the @xmath5 gate is the most important operation in the quantum game since it introduces quantum entanglement . in this section",
    "we show that the @xmath5 gate can be realized in terms of a sequence of beam splitters , cross kerr medium , and phase shifters .",

    "we assume the self - modulation terms @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be ignored by an appropriate choice of resonance @xcite .",
    "our scheme to realize the @xmath5-gate is indicated in fig.[cong : jgate ] , which consists of four 50:50 beam splitters , four phase shifters , one cross - kerr medium and some mirrors .",
    "all of the bss are 50:50 beam splitters .",
    "the cross - kerr medium couples the lights in mode @xmath45 and @xmath65 .",
    "the lights of four modes first pass through bs1 and bs2 , and two of them go through the cross - kerr medium , then they change their phases by four phase shifters , whose value is connected with the nonlinear kerr coefficient , at last they propagate through beam splitters , bs3 and bs4 .",

    "hence , the unitary transformation ( [ 14 ] ) faithfully realize the @xmath5-gate operation to generate the initial entangled state ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented a optical scheme to realize the quantum prisoner s dilemma by using beam splitters , phase shifters , cross - kerr medium and mirrors with single - photon sources .",
    "it should also be possible to use this method to realize multi - player quantum game .",
    "we believe that the practical realization of such quantum games should provide further insight into the studies of quantum networks .",
