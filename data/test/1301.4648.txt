    "in petroleum reservoirs in order to find the lithology , the well - logging technique has proved adequate for oil exploration and production .",
    "parallel to the research of oil and gas fields , some features of petrophysical quantities obtained by well - logging could be analyzed and described in terms of the kind and content of the fluids within the pores .",
    "the quantities investigated in this research includes gamma emission ( gr ) , which is a measure of the natural radiation of the formation ; sonic transient time ( dt ) , which is a recording of the time required for a sound wave to travel through a formation ; neutron porosity ( nphi ) , which uses high - energy neutrons that collide with various atoms of both the formation material and fluids , reporting the existence of hydrogen in the pore space @xcite .",
    "these help us insight into the spatial heterogeneity of the properties of the large scale porous media , such as porosity , density , and the lithology at distinct length scales @xcite .    in geological systems",
    "external forces besides internal instabilities cause the system to become a complex system . in order to analyze geological systems the theory of complex systems",
    "needs to be implemented . in this theory",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) , entropy , and the degree of non - gaussianity is used .",
    "however the working parameter in this study is the entropy which is an important bases in thermodynamics .",
    "entropy was introduced in @xmath2 by rudolf julius emmanuel clausius @xcite .",
    "later boltzmann showed that entropy could be expressed in terms of the probabilities related to the microscopic structures of the system @xcite .",
    "when a system is in contact with a large reservoir , the boltzmann - gibbs entropy is obtained as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the probability of the microscopic configuration @xmath5 @xcite , and @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "so one can conclude that entropy is subject to the probabilities of possibilities in system , reflecting the information upon the physical system @xcite .",
    "it is well - known in the classical boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistical mechanics that the gaussian pdf under appropriate constraints , maximizes the bg entropy .",
    "bg statistics has been successful in explaining the behavior of systems in which short spatial / temporal interactions are significant @xcite .",
    "tsallis in @xmath7 proposed an entropy for systems that may have a multifractal , scale - free or hierarchical structure in the occupancy of their phase space as in the form @xcite @xmath8 which generalizes @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "where @xmath10 is nonnegative , concave , experimentally robust ( or lesche - stable @xcite ) and yield a finite entropy production per unit time @xcite .",
    "note that the applicability of tsalis entropy becomes important for systems with long - ranged correlations which involve strong interactions , glassy systems , fractal processes , some types of dissipative dynamics and other systems that in some way violate ergodicity .",
    "the entropy of expression @xmath11 has been applied to a wide range of science such as physics , biology , chemistry , economics , geophysics @xcite and medicines @xcite and references therein .     at depth @xmath12 to @xmath13 of a gas well in southwest of iran.,width=377,height=207 ]    we use well log data from a gas well in southwest of iran .",
    "these data are gamma ray radioactivity ( gr ) , sonic transient time ( dt ) and neutron porosity ( nphi ) taken every @xmath14 at the depth interval of @xmath15 meters",
    ". the logged interval includes asmari formation which is one of the main oil producer formations in iran reservoirs and consists mainly of fractured carbonate , sand stone , shaly sand and a trace of anhydrate .",
    "@xmath16 shows gr , dt and nphi data sets from the depth , @xmath17 , of @xmath12 to @xmath18 .",
    "our analysis is based on the increment of the petrophysical quantities shown by @xmath19 in various scales , @xmath20 , which @xmath21 .    in this article",
    "we describe the petrophysical quantities using the pdf and non - gaussian degree , @xmath0 , based on tsallis entropy in section @xmath22 .",
    "we explain the connection between entropy ( less of information ) and the non - gaussian factor @xmath23 ( intermittency ) for these data sets in section @xmath24 and the conclusions are stated in section @xmath25 .    .",
    "these estimations are fulfilled on petrophysical quantities such as gamma emission ( gr ) , sonic transient time ( dt ) and neutron porosity ( nphi ) that measured in space interval @xmath14 from a gas well in southwest of iran .",
    "solid lines are theoretical estimation achieved by fitting data sets to eq .",
    "since the shannon entropy is the logarithm of the probability , the entropy is extensive .",
    "as known the shannon entropy is considering all phenomenon based on the boltzmanian probability distribution function ( pdf ) . while , in general the experimental systems have no reason to obey the boltzmanian distribution .",
    "tsallis added a power of @xmath0 to the probability to be able to generalize the shannon entropy to all phenomenon , this causes the entropy not to be extensive . as the value of @xmath0 increases , the effects of the tails become more pronounced . hence , in systems where @xmath0 is greater than unity the minority is more pronounced compared a gaussian ( @xmath28 ) system .",
    "in other words having the value of @xmath0 greater than unity , non - gaussianity appears .    in order to determine the non - gaussian degree of the system , @xmath0",
    ", it is essential to determine the probability distribution function analytically . following the formalism of @xcite",
    ", we obtain the probability distribution function .",
    "since the most probable distribution corresponds to the maximum entropy , the variational principle is applied to @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath22 , non - gaussianity of gr is more pronounced in comparison to dt and nphi .",
    "hence , powerful correlations and large fluctuations in the series are observed which influence the other quantities and gives an insight to the formation of the system .",
    "however , it could be seen in the third panel which is for nphi , that the pdf is non - gaussian at small scales but tends to be gaussian at large scales which corresponds to large and small values of @xmath0 respectively . as the values of @xmath0 in nphi tends to @xmath16 ,",
    "no correlation exists , hence no information about the porosity would be available @xcite .",
    "in the right panel of fig .",
    "@xmath24 , the entropy of the data sets are plotted vs. the scales .",
    "it is shown that the entropy of gr has its least value at all scales , meaning that we have fine information about the existence of shaly layers detected by gamma ray .",
    "hence , the entropy decreases as the scale increases .",
    "also it is shown that the entropy of nphi is small at small scales which proves the existence of local correlation , but increases for large scales .",
    "this expresses the separated and uncorrelated porosity . comparing fig.@xmath22 and fig .",

    "is mainly determined by @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath53 .    in fig.@xmath54 the behavior of the entropy for data sets",
    "is plotted vs. @xmath0 and @xmath23 in the left and right panels , respectively .",
    "since entropy is a measure of lack of information , the system with low entropy is eager to receive more information potential .",
    "this reveals that the non - gaussian factor @xmath23 is a sign of a sudden phase transient in the system .",
    "meaning that the system has two phases which is a logical reason to get close to a petroleum reservoir .",
    "as seen for gamma ray series in fig.@xmath54 , at high @xmath23 the entropy tends to decrease to show the existence of global correlation with a strong interaction with environment .",
    "in fact the increase in the @xmath23 leads to a non - gaussian pdf .",

    "non - gaussian pdf at large scales gives us information about the criticality in the system which results in the entropy decreases .",
