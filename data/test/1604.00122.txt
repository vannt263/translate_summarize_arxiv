    "the gapless modes are destroyed for @xmath87 , where the spectral weight @xmath89 does not show any peak at @xmath88 , indicating that the helical edge modes in the single particle - spectrum are gapped out without symmetry breaking .    putting the above bulk and edge properties together , we conclude that the crossover behavior appears in two types of topological phases at a given temperature . in smaller @xmath61",
    ", we find the qshi , which is characterized by the almost quantized spin - hall conductivity @xmath83 and the gapless helical edge modes . on the other hand , for larger @xmath61",
    ", the spin - hall conductivity is still almost quantized , but the single - particle spectrum does not host any gapless mode , indicating the presence of gapless modes carrying the spin current only in collective excitation spectra .",
    "this phase is thus identified as the temi .",
    "the above crossover between the qshi ( smaller @xmath61 ) and the temi ( larger @xmath61 ) is observed at a given temperature ( @xmath57 ) , which is much less than the size of bulk energy gap .",
    "when the temperature increases , the crossover becomes obscured , and at temperatures higher than the bulk energy gap , the system enters the high temperature region where all the topological properties disappear . on the other hand ,",
    "when the temperature becomes lower , we can confirm that the crossover region shifts to the small @xmath61 region ; namely the qshi ( temi ) region becomes smaller ( larger ) .",
    "this is because at lower temperatures , the effects of @xmath65 and @xmath61 are more prominent , leading to the enhancement of the gap at edge modes and thus stabilizing the temi .",

    "our systematic analysis for the bulk and the edge at finite temperatures has demonstrated the possible realization of the temi state whose topological structure remains nontrivial up to the mott transition in the bulk , and induces gapless edge modes only in collective modes .",
    "the numerical data for bulk properties have indicated that the spin - hall conductivity takes @xmath0 in the insulating phase , which predicts gapless edge modes carrying the spin current .",
    "intriguingly , numerical data for edge properties have suggested the presence of single - particle gap at edges in contrast to the non - interacting qshi .",
    "putting these observations for the bulk and edges together , we have ended up with the temi where collective modes carry the spin current . with bosonization analysis , we have confirmed that the crossover region between the qshi and the temi shifts to the smaller @xmath61 region with lowering temperature , and eventually at zero temperature the topological phase is completely dominated by the temi for any @xmath71 if the antiferromagnetic spin exchange interaction @xmath65 is introduced . we have also shown that collective helical modes in density - density correlation function @xmath66 ( @xmath11 ) are protected by charge u(1 ) , spin u(1 ) , the time - reversal symmetry , where @xmath148 denotes the density of electrons with spin @xmath11 .    in order to study low - temperature properties numerically in more detail",
    ", one needs to analyze the system by properly taking into account the spatial fluctuations which are considered to be important in the low temperature region .",
    "the detailed analysis of the temi state is an open problem to be addressed , and also an extension of the system to three dimensions is an interesting future work .",
