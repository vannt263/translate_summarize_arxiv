    "many practical sources and channels are not well - described by memoryless models . in wireless communication , for example ,",
    "memory in the form of intersymbol interference is quite prominent due to multipath propagation , as are slow variations in channel conditions due to mobility . in practice , this type of memory is most commonly handled by eliminating it , by augmenting the transmitter / receiver appropriately to create an overall memoryless channel .",
    "memoryless coding techniques are then used for communication .",
    "channel equalization and ofdm techniques are perhaps the most notable examples of this approach .",

    "little is known about the theory of polarization for settings with memory .",

    "we first give a proof of polarization that is both simpler than the one given in  @xcite , and holds for the more general class of @xmath0-mixing processes .",
    "we then show that the asymptotic rate of polarization to deterministic distributions is as in the memoryless case .",
