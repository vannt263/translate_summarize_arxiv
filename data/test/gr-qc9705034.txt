    "the current construction of kilometer - scale interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , such as the american ligo ( laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory @xcite ) and the french - italian virgo @xcite , has motivated a lot of recent work on data analysis tools to search and measure the expected gravitational - wave signals @xcite . thus far , the mostly studied waves have been those generated by the adiabatic inspiral of a compact binary system , composed of neutron stars and/or black holes @xcite . because of their reliably large event rate @xcite , these waves are currently believed to be the most promising for detection by ligo / virgo . and because their waveforms can be accurately predicted , searching and measuring these waves will be best accomplished with the well - known technique of matched filtering @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on certain issues related to the _ search _ of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries .",
    "the method of matched filtering @xcite relies on the fact that an accurate model can be constructed for the expected signal . the model ( usually called the template ) depends on various parameters , such as the signal s time of arrival , its initial phase , the masses of the companions , their spin angular momenta , and others .",
    "the template is cross - correlated with the detector output , and the parameters are varied until the largest correlation is obtained .",
    "if the maximum correlation ( usually called the signal - to - noise ratio ) is larger than a specified threshold value , then a signal is concluded to be present .",
    "a large effort is currently underway to calculate inspiraling binary waveforms to high order in a post - newtonian approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the assumption that the orbital motion is sufficiently slow that the waves can be expressed as a power series in @xmath0 , the ratio of the orbital velocity to the speed of light . because the series converges very slowly , if at all , a large number of terms are required @xcite .",
    "thus far , the waveforms have been computed to order @xmath1 ( 2.5 post - newtonian , or 2.5pn , order ) beyond the leading - order , quadrupole - formula expressions @xcite .",
    "central to the theory of matched filtering is wiener s theorem @xcite , which states that the expectation value of the correlation is maximized when the template parameters match those of the actual signal . for the theorem to apply , however",
    ", the functional form of the template must be the same as that of the signal , so that template and signal are allowed to disagree only in the value of their parameters .",
    "in view of the fact that the signal is governed by the exact laws of general relativity , while the template necessarily constitutes an approximation , we must expect that the actual signal - to - noise ratio will be somewhat less than the maximum allowed by wiener s theorem @xcite .",
    "we must also expect that the value of the template parameters which maximize the correlation will not precisely match the value of the source parameters .",
    "apostolatos @xcite has introduced the _ fitting factor _ ( ff ) as a measure of template imperfection .",
    "the fitting factor is the ratio of the actual signal - to - noise ratio , obtained with the imperfect template , to the signal - to - noise ratio that would be obtained if a perfect template were available @xcite",
    ". a fitting factor of unity means that the template is a very accurate representation of the signal ( a perfect template ) .",
    "a value less than unity means that the template reproduces the signal only imperfectly .",
    "the loss in event rate due to template imperfection is given by @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the fitting factor is computed as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be the actual signal , and let @xmath4 be the templates , with the vector @xmath5 representing the parameters .",
    "we denote the fourier transforms of these functions by @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , where @xmath8 for any function @xmath9 .",
    "we define the _ ambiguity function _ @xmath10 by @xmath11 where , for any functions @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 here , an overbar indicates complex conjugation , and @xmath14 is the ( one - sided ) spectral density of the detector noise . for interferometric detectors of the advanced - ligo type , it is appropriate @xcite to set @xmath15 $ ] for @xmath16 , while @xmath17 for @xmath16 ; @xmath18 is a normalization constant irrelevant for our purposes , and @xmath19 is the frequency at which the noise is minimum . the quantity @xmath20 is usually interpreted as an inner product in the hilbert space of gravitational - wave signals @xcite , and @xmath21 is the angle between the signal @xmath3 and the template @xmath4 .",
    "the fitting factor is given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the minimum value of this angle .",
    "apostolatos @xcite has suggested that templates for which @xmath24 would be acceptably accurate , leading to a loss in event rate no larger than approximately 27% .    to compute the fitting factor",
    "one must first provide a reference signal @xmath3 and a parameterized set of templates @xmath4 .",
    "while post - newtonian waveforms make an obvious choice of templates , the selection of a reference signal is much more delicate , because an exact representation of the gravitational waves is not available . in all studies",
    "undertaken thus far @xcite , the reference signal was also chosen to be a post - newtonian waveform , but one computed with more accuracy than the templates .",
    "( for example , the signal is taken to be a 2.5pn waveform , while the templates are chosen to be newtonian , or 1pn , or 1.5pn , or 2pn waveforms . )",
    "this approach is flawed , because even a high - order post - newtonian approximation may still be a poor representation of the true general - relativistic signal @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make a different choice of reference signal which , we believe , bears a closer resemblance to the true general - relativistic signal for binary systems with small mass ratios .",
    "this signal is obtained by solving the teukolsky equation @xcite for the gravitational perturbations produced by the circular motion of a small mass around a large nonrotating black hole @xcite . in this approach",
    ", no assumption is made regarding the size of @xmath25 , the orbital velocity .",
    "this is one advantage over post - newtonian theory .",
    "however , one disadvantage is the necessary restriction to binary systems with small mass ratios .",

    "the term `` restricted '' refers to the fact that while the phase function @xmath113 is calculated to 2pn order beyond the quadrupole - formula expression , the amplitude function @xmath114 is kept at leading order .    because the templates do not have the same functional form as the signal",
    ", @xmath111 and @xmath112 do not have direct physical meaning .",

    "it is therefore convenient to introduce the rescaled parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 , defined by @xmath120 it is also convenient to make the following transformations : @xmath121 where @xmath122 with @xmath123 an arbitrarily chosen frequency .",

    "evaluation of the ambiguity function , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , for a given binary system and a given set of template parameters , is a straightforward numerical problem .",
    "first @xmath63 and @xmath76 are computed once and for all , and tabulated for many values of the orbital velocity .",
    "next , @xmath93 is calculated for the binary system under consideration .",
    "combining the results and summing over the relevant modes gives @xmath6 , eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath7 is given in analytical form by eqs .",
    "( [ 10])([15 ] ) . the overlap integral @xmath128 is then evaluated . to do this efficiently",
    "it is advantageous to choose the constants @xmath123 and @xmath92 [ see eqs .  ( [ 9 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) ] so that @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and their slopes all vanish where the integrand is largest .",
    "this ensures that signal and template are approximately in phase in the frequency interval that contributes the most to the integral .",
    "now , the integrand is fairly well approximated by @xmath131 , where @xmath132 , which is maximum at @xmath133 .",
    "we therefore set @xmath134 . and since @xmath6 is dominated by the @xmath95 mode , we correspondingly put @xmath135 . with these choices , computation of @xmath128 is optimized .",
    "evaluation of @xmath136 and @xmath137 presents no additional difficulties , and combining the results gives @xmath10 .",
    "we now discuss the issue of maximizing the ambiguity function over the template parameters .",
    "maximization over @xmath138 is straightforward .",
    "since @xmath138 comes as an overall phase in @xmath7 , we have that @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is linear in @xmath138 , and where @xmath141 is some function of the remaining parameters .",
    "maximization over @xmath138 is achieved by making @xmath142 , which yields @xmath143 .",
    "since @xmath137 and @xmath136 do not depend on @xmath138 , we have also maximized @xmath10 over @xmath138 .",
    "we will denote this reduced ambiguity function by @xmath144 .",
    "maximizing this over the remaining parameters is _ not _ a straightforward numerical problem , because the ambiguity function displays a very rich structure , featuring many local minima and maxima ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we proceed as follows . for each binary system under consideration",
    "we evaluate the reduced ambiguity function in a fairly large neighborhood of @xmath145 .",
    "the function is then displayed graphically with the help of a three - dimensional visualization software @xcite , and the approximate position of the global maximum is determined .",
    "finally , the maximum is determined accurately by applying powell s method as described in the book _ numerical recipes _ @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath144 at the global maximum is the fitting factor ff .",
    "the calculations described in this section require a great deal of numerical work . to minimize the possibility of making coding errors which would affect our results and conclusions , a separate code was written by each of the authors .",
    "because the outputs of the two separate codes agree within the numerical uncertainty quoted in the caption of table ii , we are quite confident in the accuracy of our results .",
    "our results are displayed in table ii .",
    "for each binary system we consider two types of signals .",
    "the one - mode signal contains only the @xmath95 mode , while the @xmath45 signal contains all modes up to @xmath97 .",
    "inclusion of additional modes does not change the results within the numerical uncertainty .",
    "we see that the fitting factors for the one - mode signals are large , all above approximately 95% . however , inclusion of additional modes decrease the fitting factors appreciably : the reduction ranges from approximately 3% for low - mass systems to approximately 7% for large - mass systems .",
    "we have verified that most of this reduction can be attributed to the @xmath96 mode .",
    "nevertheless , the fitting factors are all larger than 90% , except for the large - mass system @xmath37 .",
    "the second post - newtonian templates therefore meet the apostolatos criterion @xcite , and we conclude that they should be adequate to search for gravitational waves emitted during the adiabatic inspiral of a compact binary system .",

    "[ we discard all post - newtonian corrections in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , and @xmath119 disappears from the list of template parameters . ] here the fitting factors are computed using a one - mode signal , as this gives the largest result .",
    "we see that these fitting factors are all much smaller than those of table ii .",
    "the newtonian templates do not meet the apostolatos criterion @xcite .",
    "the reduction in fitting factor that occurs when a one - mode signal is replaced by a @xmath45 signal is clearly caused by the template s inability to keep track of the additional frequency components .",
    "we have attempted to improve the performance of our templates by adding a term @xmath151 } , \\label{16}\\ ] ] where the constant of proportionality is the same as in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "while @xmath7 describes waves at twice the orbital frequency and is the leading - order term in a post - newtonian expansion , @xmath152 describes waves at three times the orbital frequency and is a correction term of order @xmath25 .",
    "equation ( [ 16 ] ) was obtained by fourier transforming eq .",
    "( 3b ) of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "our expectation was that this additional term would do a good job at reproducing the behavior of the @xmath96 mode , and that the loss in ff would be regained . calculating fitting factors with @xmath153 as templates shows otherwise .",
    "( some thought must be given to the fact that @xmath138 no longer appears as an overall phase in the templates . )",
    "the improvement in ff was less than 1% for the large - mass systems , and less than 0.1% for the low - mass systems .",
    "this prompts us to conclude that it would be pointless to introduce additional frequency components in the search templates .",
    "it is interesting to observe that for low - mass systems , the maximum of the ambiguity function is obtained when @xmath154 is approximately 0.1% above its actual value , while @xmath112 is approximately 40% of its actual value .",
    "these numbers can be loosely interpreted as the systematic errors incurred when attempting to estimate the source parameters with imperfect 2pn templates .",
    "the systematic errors should be compared with the anticipated statistical uncertainties associated with the measurement of a noisy signal @xcite .",
    "cutler and flanagan @xcite have determined that for low - mass systems known to be composed of nonrotating companions , the statistical uncertainty associated with the estimation of @xmath154 is of the order of 0.005% , while it is of the order of 1% for @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "( this assumes detection with a signal - to - noise ratio of 10 . )",
    "second post - newtonian templates therefore give rise to systematic errors that are much larger than the statistical uncertainties .",
    "while these templates could be adequate to search for signals , they should not be used as measurement templates .",
