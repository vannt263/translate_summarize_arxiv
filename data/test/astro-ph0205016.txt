    "since davis & peebles ( 1983 ) first analyzed the anisotropy in the galaxy distribution from center for astrophysics ( cfa ) redshift catalog , it has been recognized that the peculiar velocity field of galaxies induces a significant systematic effect in statistics of observed galaxy distributions in redshift space . in particular , virialized random motion of galaxies produces an elongated pattern of galaxy distribution along the line of sight , called _ finger - of - god_. this effect significantly suppresses the amplitude of the two - point correlation function of galaxies in redshift space , especially on scales below @xmath0mpc .",
    "the proper account of this redshift - space distortion requires a detailed model for the pairwise velocity distribution function ( hereafter , pvdf ) of galaxies .",
    "davis & peebles ( 1983 ) discovered that the pvdf of the cfa galaxy sample is approximately described by an exponential distribution , instead of a gaussian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the separation length and @xmath3 denote the pairwise peculiar velocity between a pair of galaxy along the line - of - sight direction .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is the peculiar velocity dispersion ( pvd ) .",
    "the exponential form of pvdf was confirmed also later by analyses of @xmath5-body simulations of dark matter particles and of other samples of galaxies ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 , fisher et al .",
    "1994 , marzke et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "theoretical models for the origin of the exponential pvdf of dark matter were put forward by sheth ( 1996 ) and diaferio & geller ( 1996 ) , and more recently by sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) .",
    "they phenomenologically introduced a nonlinear model of pvdf using the press ",
    "schechter formalism . to be more specific",
    ", they assume that any dark matter particle belongs to one of virialized clumps ( dark halos ) with the 1-point velocity distribution function being a maxwellian form .",
    "if one considers sufficiently small scales , the particle pairs of those separations are likely to be in the same halo , and then their pvdf is approximately given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mass function of dark halos , @xmath8 is the pvdf of dark matter particles within a halo of mass @xmath9 .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 represents the statistical weight proportional to the number of particle pairs with separation @xmath2 in the halo : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density profile of the halo of mass @xmath9 , and @xmath13 is the dirac delta function . adopting the singular isothermal distribution as a particular choice of the dark halo profile , sheth ( 1996 ) showed that the scale - free model of @xmath14 with @xmath15 exactly reproduces the exponential pvdf ( [ eq : exp ] ) .    while a perturbation theory ( seto & yokoyama 1998 ; juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1998 ) also qualitatively explained why the gaussian initial models approach the exponential pvdf , the above model is much more successful quantitatively .",
    "further , a significant influence of the finger - of - got effect appears at small scale , where the perturbative approach can not be applied .",
    "therefore in the present paper , we attempt to improve the sheth ( 1996 ) model ( [ eq : shethp ] ) for the pvdf in several aspects ; first , we consider more popular cdm models instead of the scale - free power - spectra .",
    "second , we adopt a series of more realistic density profiles for dark halos ( hernquist 1990 ; navarro , frenk & white 1997 ; fukushige & makino 1997 , 2001a ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ; jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "third , we derive the one - point pvdf of dark matter particles in a halo directly from the abel integral of the above density profiles , instead of assuming the maxwellian form _",
    "a priori_. this approach is important since we can incorporate the scale- and mass - dependence of the pvd in a consistent fashion unlike the previous modeling .",
    "finally we also apply the selection function following jing , brner & suto ( 2002 ) so as to phenomenologically attempt to predict the pvd of _ galaxies _ out of that of dark matter particles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows ; section 2 describes our improved modeling for the pvdf on the basis of the dark matter halo approach . in  3 , we present the resultant pvd in various cosmological models and discuss how the underlying halo profiles are sensitive to those results .",
    "we also provide a simple fitting formula of the pvd in the currently popular spatially - flat cdm model , which is useful in modeling the redshift - distortion effect .",
    "then we attempt to consider the effect of the spatial biasing of galaxies relative to the dark matter particles on the pvd by applying a phenomenological biasing scheme .",
    "finally section 4 is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "our present method to compute the pvdf is schematically shown in figure [ fig : pvdf_procedure ] .",
    "we will describe the details of the procedure below . throughout the paper , we consider the three representative cdm models parameterized by the density parameter @xmath16 , the dimensionless cosmological parameter @xmath17 , the amplitude of the mass fluctuation smoothed over the top - hat radius of @xmath18mpc , @xmath19 , and the hubble constant in units of 100 km / s / mpc @xmath20 ; standard cdm ( @xmath21 ; scdm ) , lambda cdm ( @xmath22 ; lcdm ) , and open cdm ( @xmath23 ; ocdm ) .",
    "those models are normalized to satisfy the x - ray cluster abundances ( kitayama & suto 1997 ) .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)pvdf_procedure.eps      the density profile of dark matter halos plays a key role in our method .",
    "following the recent suggestions from high - resolution numerical simulations , we adopt the following specific form : @xmath24 in the above , @xmath9 is the mass of the halo , @xmath25 is the mean density of the universe at @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the present critical density , @xmath28 is the characteristic density excess , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 indicate the virial radius and the scale radius of the halo , respectively .    the virial radius is defined",
    "according to the spherical collapse model as @xmath31 we use the following expressions ( kitayama & suto 1996 ) for the critical over - density @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively given as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in terms of the density parameter at the collapse time , @xmath38 .    in practice , we focus on three specific profiles .",
    "( i ) the original nfw profile with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) , ( ii ) the modified nfw profile with @xmath41 indicated by higher - resolution simulations ( fukushige & makino 1997 , 2001a , b ; moore et al . 1998 ; jing & suto 2000 ) , ( iii ) the hernquist profile with @xmath39 and @xmath42 ( hernquist 1990 ) for which the analytic expression of the phase - space distribution function is known .",
    "the two parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not independent , and are related in terms of the concentration parameter : @xmath45 the condition that the total mass inside @xmath44 is equal to @xmath9 relates @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore the halo mass - dependence of the above profiles is entirely specified by @xmath48 . in the case of the original nfw profile ,",
    "we use the approximate fitting function from the simulation data of bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) : @xmath49 for the other profiles , we first compute the amplitude of the two - point correlation functions of dark matter following the procedure of seljak ( 2000 ) and ma & fry ( 2000 ) , and then find the amplitude of the concentration parameter which reproduces the peacock  dodds ( 1996 ) fitting formula .",
    "this calibration yield @xmath50 for the modified nfw profile ( oguri et al .",
    "2001 ) , and @xmath51 for the hernquist profile , which we adopt throughout the analysis below .",
    "our next task is to compute the phase - space distribution function in a single halo from the given density profile ( [ eq : univ ] ) . while sheth ( 1996 ) and sheth et al .",
    "( 2001 ) simply adopt the gaussian velocity distribution function , we eliminate this assumption and derive the velocity distribution function in a fully consistent manner .    for this purpose , we make use of the jeans theorem which states that for a spherically symmetric and stationary system , the solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation can be expressed as a function of the specific binding energy , @xmath52 , alone . here we define @xmath53 as the minus of the gravitational potential satisfying the boundary condition of @xmath54",
    ".    one may wonder whether halos in hierarchical universes that should experience repeated merger and destruction continually are well approximated as stationary .",
    "nevertheless natarajan , hjorth & van kampen ( 1997 ) and hanyu & habe ( 2001 ) found that the phase - space distribution function directly estimated from their particle simulations agrees well with that derived from the jeans theorem .",
    "thus the above assumption is justified , at least empirically .",
    "then the phase - space distribution function @xmath55 in a single halo is directly computed from its given density profile @xmath12 as follows ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) : @xmath56 figure [ fig : fe ] plots the dimensionless phase - space distribution function @xmath57 evaluated numerically from equation ( [ eq : abel ] ) , where @xmath58 is the characteristic mass of the halo and @xmath59 is the dimensionless specific energy .",
    "the hernquist model has an analytical solution for @xmath55 which is reproduced by our numerical result almost within an accuracy of 2% except for the tiny region @xmath60 , where the error reaches at 7% but the effect is safely negligible for later analysis . since the three halo profiles that we adopt have a central cusp , @xmath61 diverges at a corresponding value of @xmath62 .",
    "the modified nfw profile has @xmath61 which extends more broadly up to @xmath63 reflecting the stronger central concentration than that of the original nfw case .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fe.eps      once the phase - space distribution function is given , one can also compute one - dimensional single - particle velocity distribution function along a particular direction by integrating over the other two components . assuming the isotropic velocity distribution",
    ", one has @xmath64 where we project along the direction of @xmath65 and the quantity @xmath66 is the corresponding binding energy .",
    "figure [ fig : f1v ] shows the dimensionless velocity distribution function @xmath67 at @xmath68 ( _ thin lines _ ) and @xmath69 ( _ thick lines _ ) , where @xmath70 is the scaling velocity .",
    "the figure indicates that the one - dimensional velocity distribution function in a halo can be reasonably approximated by the gaussian : @xmath71 although it has a sharp cutoff around the escape velocity of the halo , @xmath72 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f1v ] , the dashed lines indicate the gaussian - fit which has the same velocity dispersion evaluated from equation ( [ eq : f1 ] ) .",
    "it seems that the empirical gaussian approximation can reasonably reproduce the pvdf , and thus we use the approximation in the numerical integrations below so as to reduce the computational time .",
    "figure [ fig : svd ] plots the velocity dispersion @xmath73 computed from the best - fit gaussian , which clearly shows the scale - dependence that was neglected in the previous analysis ( sheth 1996 ; sheth et al . 2001 ) .",
    "note also the different scale - dependence from the circular velocity @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the mass inside the radius @xmath76 ( thin lines in fig.[fig : svd ] ) . in the subsequent modeling of the pvdf",
    ", we use the gaussian approximation with the fitted @xmath73 rather than repeating the full numerical integration .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)f1v.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)v_c.eps      finally we are in a position to estimate the pvdf combining the above results .",
    "since we are interested in small scales , the particle pairs with the corresponding separations are approximated to reside in the common halo . then sheth ( 1996 ) derived the following expression for the pvdf : @xmath77 where @xmath2 is the pair - separation and @xmath78 is the normalization factor given by @xmath79 the relation between the quantities used in the expressions ( [ eq:1pvdf ] ) and ( [ eq : normal ] ) are schematically summarized in figure [ fig : r12 ] .",

    "figure [ fig : f2v ] plots the resulting pvdf ( in the lcdm model ) at @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92mpc against the pairwise velocity @xmath3 normalized by the pvd at each separation .",
    "we adopt the press - schechter mass function for definiteness .",
    "note that the quantitatively similar behavior is obtained for other cosmological models , but with different pvds .",
    "the pvdf for small separation pairs ( @xmath93mpc ) is well described by the exponential distribution .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , the central region resembles the gaussian distribution while the exponential tail is still clear at large velocities . neither the inner nor outer slope of the density profile produces any systematic difference in the non - gaussian tails of pvdf , in contrast to the single - particle velocity distribution in figure [ fig : f1v ] .",
    "this qualitative behavior is in complete agreement with the result of sheth ( 1996 ) assuming the scale - free model and the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "therefore we conclude that the exponential distribution of the pvdf is a rather general consequence in the gravitational instability picture fairly independent of the underlying cosmological model .",
    "we have shown that the _ shape _ of the pvdf is well approximated by the exponential in a fairly insensitive manner to either the cosmological model or the dark halo density profile .",
    "note , however , that this does not implies the pvd is determined independently of the cosmology , but rather it is the basic source for the cosmological model - dependence , through the mass function of halos .",
    "since the pvdf is already obtained , one may evaluate the pvd @xmath4 directly as @xmath94 we note , however , that the above expression is valid only when the one - halo term @xmath95 is sufficiently larger than unity .",
    "if one takes account of particle pairs residing in two different halos that we neglect in the present modeling , one should rather replace the normalization factor @xmath96 by @xmath97 since the factor physically corresponds to the relative probability of finding a pair at separation @xmath2 .",
    "this consideration implies the normalization of the pvd from the one - halo contribution should be @xmath98 in fact , this agrees with equation ( 21 ) of sheth et al . (",
    "we compute the two - point correlation function , @xmath99 , on the basis of the dark halo approach ( seljak 2000 ) , and we also confirm that the resulting @xmath100 is in good agreement with the fitting formula of peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) by an appropriate choice of the concentration parameter @xmath101 as discussed in subsection [ subsec : rho ] .",
    "figure [ fig : lsigma ] shows the pvd calculated according to equation ( [ eq : ndisp ] ) .",
    "the comparison among the different model predictions indicates that the amplitude of pvd sensitively depends on the cosmological parameters through the mass function @xmath7 , but is almost insensitive to the density profile of dark halo .",
    "note , however , that this is partly because we have chosen the value of @xmath101 so as to reproduce the same @xmath102 irrespectively of the density profile .",
    "we also show the result with neglecting the scale - dependence of the velocity distribution in the case of the lcdm model ( _ long - dashed _ lines ) .",
    "this indicates that the isothermal approximation ( sheth et al .",
    "2001 ) is quite acceptable in predicting the pvd .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)lsigma.eps    ( 160mm,100mm)glsigma.eps    we attempted an empirical fitting to our numerical results at different redshifts ( fig.[fig : glsigma ] ) by adopting a power - law form : @xmath103 in terms of the _ comoving _ pair separation @xmath104 .",
    "the values of the amplitude @xmath105 and the power - law index @xmath106 fitted for @xmath107 are listed in table  [ tab : power - law - fit ] in the lcdm model , where @xmath108 is the comoving separation at which the pvd becomes maximum . since the two - halo term @xmath109 becomes dominant contribution to @xmath100 for larger separations , equation ( [ eq : sigmafit ] ) becomes inaccurate for @xmath110 .",
    "the fit is accurate within 5 % , which is comparable to the other systematic errors including the numerical integration or the gaussian approximation .",
    "this result may be compared with the independent prediction based on the cosmic virial theorem ( peebles 1976 ; suto 1993 ; suto & jing 1997 ) . for reference ,",
    "if the correlation function of dark matter is given by @xmath111 , the cosmic virial theorem implies that @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the normalized amplitude of the three - point correlation function .",
    "the value of @xmath113 for dark matter clustering is somewhat uncertain , but may be close to @xmath114 in lcdm ( suto 1993 ) , and thus this estimate is fairly consistent with our prediction presented here .",
    ".power - law fits to the relative peculiar velocity dispersion in the lcdm model .",
    "[ tab : power - law - fit ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      it is well known that the pvd of the observed galaxies is generally smaller than the value predicted in current popular models ( e.g. , davis & peebles 1983 ; mo , jing & brner 1993 ; suto 1993 ; suto & jing 1997 ) .",
    "this may be interpreted as a manifestation of the spatial biasing of galaxies relative to dark matter .",
    "jing , mo & brner ( 1998 ) analyzed the las campanas redshift survey galaxies and developed a phenomenological biasing model , cluster underweight bias ( clw , hereafter ) which successfully accounts for the amplitudes of the two - point correlation function and the pvd simultaneously .",
    "more recently jing , brner & suto ( 2002 ) performed the similar analysis of galaxies in the pscz catalog ( saunders et al .",
    "2000 ) which are selected from the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) point source catalog ( psc ; beichman et al .",
    "they found that the iras selected galaxies , which are likely to be dominated by late - types , have significantly smaller pvd than those in other catalogues .",
    "in addition , they applied the clw bias scheme to mock samples from @xmath5-body simulations and concluded that the pvd of the pscz galaxies is significantly smaller than those predicted from the clw bias in the popular cdm models . in this subsection",
    ", we revisit this issue combing the biasing effect with our analytical model of the pvd in a complementary manner to the direct method using the @xmath5-body data .",
    "the clw scheme can be applied to our analytical model easily . according to jing et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we adopt that the selection function of galaxies in a halo of mass @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "this is simply equivalent to replacing the mass function @xmath7 in equation ( [ eq : pvdf ] ) by @xmath116 . because this biasing model puts lower weight on the massive clusters where the velocity dispersion is large",
    ", increasing @xmath117 suppresses the mean pvd .",
    "in fact , the las campanas redshift survey data are consistent with @xmath118 , and the pscz data prefer a much larger value @xmath119 . physically speaking",
    ", this phenomenological prescription should be understood as the dependence of the efficiency of galaxy formation on the mass of the hosting halo .",
    "in addition we consider another biasing to take into account the observed density - morphology relation of galaxies .",
    "since spiral galaxies preferentially avoid the central region of massive clusters ( i.e. , halos in the present context ) , the pvd of spirals is generally suppressed especially in the case of the modified nfw profile that has stronger central concentration ( c.f .",
    ", fig.[fig : svd ] ) .",
    "we attempt to incorporate this effect by introducing the selection probability that depends on a distance from the center of the halo : @xmath120 we set @xmath121 and @xmath122 so as to reproduce the observed ratio of spirals to ellipticals ; 2:8 in the inner part and 8:2 in the outer part . in practice",
    ", we calculate the pvd by replacing @xmath12 by @xmath123 in equation ( [ eq : ndisp ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : bias ] for the modified nfw profile in the lcdm model .",
    "the dotted and short - dashed lines represent the results taking account of the clw bias effect while the long - dashed lines consider the density  morphology relation ( eq.[[eq : dmr ] ] ) in addition to the clw bias .",
    "the degree of suppression of the pvd is in agreement with the simulation results of jing et al .",
    "even with the density  morphology relation , the pvd of the iras pscz galaxies is too small to be reconciled in the current model as jing et al .",
    "( 2002 ) claimed .",
    "we have presented a detailed prediction for the pairwise peculiar velocity distribution function ( pvdf ) applying the dark matter halo approach . in particular , we have derived the pvdf in a direct and self - consistent manner with the assumed density profile for dark matter halo for the first time .",
    "on the other hand , we neglect the halo - halo contribution assuming that any pair of particles resides in a common halo .",
    "thus our predictions are quantitatively valid only on small scales @xmath124mpc , but our result turns out to be fairly close to the previous one by sheth ( 1996 ) and sheth et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who assumed the _",
    "isothermal _ velocity distribution in a single halo . in this sense",
    ", our independent approach may be regarded as to provide an empirical justification for their simplifying assumptions , and also our predictions are fairly accurate on those small scales .",
    "we have shown that the shape of the pvdf is well approximated by the exponential in a fairly insensitive manner to either the cosmological model or the dark halo density profile .",
    "the dependence on the pvd on the halo density profiles that we employed is also fairly small , yielding the difference less than about 10 percent .",
    "we have also obtained a practical fitting formula for the pvd of dark matter particles ( eq.[[eq : sigmafit ] ] ) at different cosmological models as a function of the pair separation .",
    "this may be useful in modeling redshift - space distortion of clustering .",
    "the result is in reasonable agreement with the estimate on the basis of the cosmic virial theorem .",
    "furthermore we apply an empirical biasing scheme into our model and attempt to predict the pvd of _ galaxies_. we can reproduce the previous simulation results on the basis of our analytical method , and also confirmed that the very small pvd estimated for the pscz galaxies ( jing et al .",
    "2002 ) is difficult to be reconciled with a simplistic biasing model and/or the underlying cdm model .",
    "the discrepancy between the prediction and the observation shown in section [ sec : bias ] indicates the presence of velocity bias , in addition to the other selection effects .",
    "in fact , each luminous galaxy is a clump composed of the baryon as well as dark matter particles , whose bulk motion might not trace the random motion of the individual dark matter particles . in this case , the galaxy - galaxy interaction through tidal field or gas pressure of baryon might be an important source for velocity bias .",
    "at least , our present treatment using dark matter halo approach can provide a quantitative prediction for the pvd of the dark matter particles .",
    "therefore next step , the effect of velocity bias including these interactions should be incorporated into our scheme to account for the pvd of the galaxies ."
