    "the standard model is greatly successful but it still has many free parameters which must be small to describe nature . while its supersymmetric extensions , e.g. ,  the minimal supersymmetric standard model , are attractive scenarios , small couplings are also required to explain observed facts such as the fermion mass hierarchy and mixing angles .    in recent years , extra dimensions have cast a new perspective on physics beyond the standard model .",
    "one of the important aspects of extra dimensional models is that bulk fields can be localized with finite - width wave - function profiles .",
    "this fact provides us with a geometrical explanation for small numbers .",
    "that is , with a configuration where some fields are separated from each other in the extra dimensional space , the couplings among them are generally suppressed .",
    "then how and where fields are localized is an issue to be considered . from this viewpoint , extra dimensional models with a curved background",
    "are interesting because fields could be localized depending on the shape of the background geometry .",
    "one of the most famous examples of curved geometries is the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model with the ads@xmath0 warped metric  @xcite .",
    "field theories of vectors , spinors , and scalars have been studied on this background  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the localization behavior of zero - mode wave functions has interesting applications to phenomenology such as the suppression of unwanted operators .",
    "for example , hierarchical forms of yukawa couplings and proton decay were studied in  @xcite .",
    "the localization of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excited modes also leads to interesting phenomena .",
    "for instance , the localization of higher kk gauge bosons could realize a composite scalar ( higgs ) condensation , which induces dynamical ( electroweak ) symmetry breaking on the brane where the kk gauge bosons localize  @xcite .",
    "in addition , models on more complicated backgrounds where a warp factor oscillates generate bulk fields which localize at some points in extra dimensions  @xcite . this type of localization might be useful in explaining the observed phenomena .",
    "however extra dimensional theories are generally nonrenormalizable and the calculations depend on the regularization scheme that one adopts . furthermore ,",
    "extra dimensional theories are constrained by symmetries of higher dimensions .",
    "for example , in the supersymmetric case , bulk theories are constrained by @xmath5 supersymmetry in five dimensions .",
    "motivated by these facts , recently a four - dimensional ( 4d ) description of extra dimensional models was proposed  @xcite . with this method",
    ", the phenomena of higher dimensional models are reproduced in terms of 4d theories , and several interesting models have been proposed along this line  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present 4d gauge theories that describe physics on 5d curved geometries .",
    "as will be discussed below , taking generic values of gauge couplings and gauge - symmetry - breaking vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , the models provide vector , spinor , and scalar fields on curved extra dimensions . as a good and simple illustration",
    ", we compare our 4d model with the rs one .",
    "we particularly focus on the `` localization '' behaviors of mass eigenstates in `` index spaces '' of gauge groups .",
    "it will be shown that the localization profiles and the exponentially suppressed massive spectrum are certainly reproduced .",
    "in addition , our formulation gives a localization mechanism even for massless vector fields . as a phenomenological application ,",
    "hierarchical yukawa matrices are derived in our approach ; that is a hierarchy without symmetries in four dimensions .",
    "the localization behavior depends on the required conditions for gauge - symmetry - breaking vevs and gauge and other couplings .",
    "if these values are determined in the underlying theories , it may be said that the physics on warped backgrounds is dynamically generated within a four - dimensional framework .",
    "we consider several possibilities to realize the conditions by utilizing , for example , strongly coupled gauge theories .",
    "thus this could provide a purely 4d dynamical approach for small numbers .",
    "we will proceed with the argument as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dwd ] , we describe our 4d gauge theories , which have generic ( nonuniversal ) values of gauge - symmetry - breaking vevs and couplings .",
    "the models provide vector , spinor , and scalar fields in warped extra dimensions .",
    "it is also shown that supersymmetry multiplets in flat 4d models generate supersymmetry multiplets on warped backgrounds . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ne ] , we then numerically determine with a finite number of gauge groups that the formulation given in sec .",
    "2 certainly reproduces various properties of bulk fields on the rs background .",
    "in addition , a phenomenological application to quark mass matrices is also given . finally , we discuss possibilities of dynamically realizing the conditions required for curved geometries in sec .",

    "<S> we present four - dimensional gauge theories that describe physics on five - dimensional curved ( warped ) backgrounds , which includes bulk fields with various spins ( vectors , spinors , and scalars ) . </S>",
    "<S> field theory on the ads@xmath0 geometry is examined as a simple example of our formulation . </S>",
    "<S> various properties of bulk fields on this background , e.g. ,  the mass spectrum and field localization behavior , can be achieved within a fully four - dimensional framework . moreover , that gives a localization mechanism for massless vector fields . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider supersymmetric cases , and show in particular that the conditions on bulk masses imposed by supersymmetry on warped backgrounds are derived from a four - dimensional supersymmetric theory on the flat background . as a phenomenological application , </S>",
    "<S> models are shown to generate hierarchical yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss possible underlying mechanisms which dynamically realize the required couplings to generate curved geometries .    </S>",
