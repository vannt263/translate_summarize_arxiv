    "the dynamics of mean - field models displays intriguing features .",
    "particles may be trapped in intermediate ( out - of - equilibrium ) states , whose duration diverges with the number of constitutive elements , and which substantially differ from the corresponding thermodynamic equilibrium configuration .",
    "these metastable states are often termed in the literature quasi - stationary states , hereafter qss , and bear an extraordinary conceptual importance as they potentially corresponds to the solely experimentally accessible regimes , for a wide range of applications ranging from celestial mechanics to plasma physics .",
    "interestingly , the evolution of the qss is intimately governed by the discreteness of the medium being investigated .",

    ", out - of - equilibrium phase transitions are predicted to occur , separating between distinct macroscopic qsss .",
    "the lynden - bell protocol , also termed violent relaxation theory , was also argued to apply to other mean - field models and , indeed , it showed effective in predicting the saturate intensity of a free - electron laser ( fel ) .",
    "fels are lasing devices consisting of a relativistic beam of charged particles , interacting with a co - propagating electromagnetic wave .",
    "the interaction is assisted by the static and periodic magnetic field generated by an undulator .",
    "fel s admit a mean - field description in term of the so  called colson - bonifacio model@xcite , which captures the essence of the collective wave - particle dynamics .",
    "however , no detailed study has been carried out for the fel case aiming at unravelling the possible existence of out - of - equilibrium transition of the type mentioned above .",
    "are these transitions ubiquitous in mean field dynamics and , in this case , can we provide a consistent intrepretative framework for their emergence ?",
    "this paper is dedicated to answering such questions , and makes reference to the specific fel setting .",
    "we also stress that the colson - bonifacio model of fel dynamics can be regarded as a general formulation for all those applications where the complex interplay between particles and fields is well known to be central , e.g. electrostatic instabilities in plasma physics@xcite . as a closing remark",
    ", we notice that , on the practical implication side , by disposing of reliable predictive tools on the system evolution , one can aim at guiding the system towards different experimental regimes .",
    "the colson - bonifacio model for the fel dynamics describes the coupled evolution of the electrons with a co - propagating wave .",

    "the discrete system is in turn sensitive to intrinsic granularity effects , stemming from the intimate finiteness of the simulated medium , and progressively migrate from the vlasov state towards the deputed equilibrium configuration .",
    "when increasing its size , the system spends progressively more time in the vlasov - like , out - of - equilibrium regime .",
    "formally , in the @xmath8 limit , it never reaches equilibrium , being permanently trapped in the qss .",

    "interestingly , the lb0 and water  bag ( wb ) evolutions are qualitatively similar , and , moreover , display the same average asymptotic value for the intensity @xmath23 .",
    "even more important , the asymptotic value corresponds to the lba ( maximum entropy ) solution .     as a function of time , for three different choices of the initial condition : wb ( plain line ) , lba ( dashed line ) and lb0 ( dotted line ) .",

    "the lba initial condition is always stable under vlasov dynamics .",
    "it is in fact a global maximum of the lynden - bell entropy , which , in this respect , proves adequate to describe the system at hand .",
    "the observed lb0 evolution is by far more complex . for large values of the energy ,",
    "lb0 is stable .",
    "the stability is eventually lost when reducing the energy parameter : a transition materializes and the lb0 evolves towards the lba state . in the vicinity of the transition ,",
    "the lb0 initial condition approaches an asymptotic configuration , which slightly differs from the lba one , and possibly results from a balance between opposing dynamical strengths .",
    "the wb evolution mimics that of lb0 , the two curves returning a pretty close correspondence . in practice , during a short transient , an initially bunched wb expands ( almost ) ballistically , the particles being essentially transported by their own initial velocities , so visiting the whole interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the obtained distribution can be approximated by a homogeneous lb0 state ( the field has not yet developed , its intensity being effectively negligible ) , which in turn explains the observed correspondence .",
    "we shall however emphasize that this mechanism applies to relatively small @xmath16 amounts .",

    "fig : fel_comp_0.50 ] : the agreement between lb0 and wb evolution is shown to worsen , when compared to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : fel_comp_0.00 ] .",
    "this is understood as follows : starting from a high degree of bunching , the induced field opposes the natural ballistic contribution , by further enhancing the tendency to form a coherent clump of particles .    in summary ,",
    "our calculation returns two stationary points of the lynden - bell entropy .",
    "the first , which we termed lba , corresponds to a inhomogeneous ( laser on ) configuration and it is a global maximum of the entropy . the second , labelled lb0 , is homogeneous ( laser off ) .",
    "for sufficiently large energies , the system can be locally trapped in the vicinity of the lb0 .",
    "this happens if the system is initiated close enough to a lb0 state , as e.g. in the case of wb with moderate @xmath16 values . for smaller @xmath17",
    ", the lb0 loses stability and the system departs towards the entropically favoured lba state . having detected no additional stationary points of the fermionic entropy , other than lb0 and lba , we interpret lb0 and lba as a saddle point and a global maximum , respectively . while lb0 could also be in principle a global minimum , this hypothesis is invalidated by the fact that there exists ( at least ) a function @xmath13 , compatible with the system dynamics , which yields a lower entropy value .",
    "consider in fact  : @xmath59    this is not a stationary point of lynden - bell s entropy but represents one of the admissible equilibria of the dynamical system ( [ eq : vlasovwave ] ) , in its coarse grained perspective as implied by the theory .",
    "the lynden - bell entropy associated to eq .",
    "( [ eq : flowers ] ) can be straightforwardly computed via eq .",
    "( [ eq : lbentro ] ) and it is found to be always smaller than @xmath57 , the value associated to the lb0 configuration , for all @xmath16 and @xmath17 . based on the above , and as previously anticipated , we can exclude the possibility for lb0 to be a global minimum .",
    "following our deductive reasoning , we hence suggest that lb0 is instead a saddle - point and the observed transition is consequently interpreted to stem from a local modification of lb0 stability properties or morphological characteristics ( e.g. width / flatness of the stability basin ) .",

    "our numerical investigation moves from the vlasov version of the model , which rigorously applies to the continuous limit and is believed to constitute the correct interpretative framework to elaborate on the qss peculiarities . working within this context , and assuming a specific class of initial conditions , we identified a switch between different macroscopic regimes .",
    "such a transition is ultimately controlled by the nominal energy value and by the initial particles bunching , in qualitative agreement with what was previously observed for the hmf model .",
