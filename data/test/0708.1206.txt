    "in the third egret catalog @xcite unidentified @xmath0-ray sources accounted for more than a half of the discrete sources detected by egret . despite a great effort ,",
    "most of them can not be associated with the known sources detected at low energies up to now .",
    "most of the efforts in identifying these sources focused on the galactic counterparts , such as young pulsars @xcite , microquasars @xcite , supernova remnants @xcite . at the same time , multiwavelength searches continue to look for counterparts in the @xmath0-ray sources , such as blazars , supernova remnants and pulsars @xcite .",
    "there are recent theoretical works trying to explain the unidentified sources as annihilating dark matter clumps within the milky way ( mw ) @xcite .",
    "these efforts try to solve the nature of dark matter .",
    "the existence of cosmological dark matter has been firmly established by a multitude of observations , such as the observations of the rotation curves in spiral galaxies and velocity dispersion in elliptical galaxies , the x - ray emission and peculiar velocities of galaxies in the clusters of galaxies , the weak lensing effects , all indicating much steeper gravitational potentials than those inferred from the luminous matter .",
    "however , the nature of the non - baryonic dark matter is still unknown and remains one of the most outstanding puzzles in particle physics and cosmology . among a large amount of theoretical candidates , the most attractive scenario involves the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "an appealing idea is that the wimps form the thermal relics of the early universe and naturally give rise to the relic abundance in the range of the observed values .",
    "the wimps are well motived theoretically by the physics beyond the standard model to solve the hierarchical problem between the weak scale and the planck scale . in particular , the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )",
    "provides an excellent wimp candidate as the lightest supersymmetric particle , usually the lightest neutralino , which are stable due to r - parity conservation @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constraints on the supersymmetric ( susy ) parameter space have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the wimps can be detected on the present running or future experiments , either directly by measuring the recoil energy when wimp scatters off the detector nuclei @xcite or indirectly by observing the annihilation products of the wimps , such as the antiprotons , positrons , @xmath0-rays or neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the rate of the wimp annihilation is proportional to the number density square of the dark matter particles .",
    "therefore the searches for the annihilation signals should aim at the regions with high matter densities , such as at the galactic center @xcite or the nearby subhalos @xcite .",
    "the existence of a wealth of subhalos throughout the galaxy halos is a generic prediction of the cdm paradigm of structure formation in the universe .",
    "high resolution simulations show that for cdm scenario the large scale structure forms hierarchically by continuous merging of smaller halos and as the remnants of the merging process about 10% to 15% of the total mass of the halo is in the form of subhalos @xcite . at the center of the subhalos there",
    "are high mass densities and therefore they provide good sites for the search of wimp annihilation products .    however , the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite shows that it seems most of the egret unidentified @xmath0-ray sources are not produced by the dark matter annihilation . in @xcite by comparing the cumulative luminosity function of subhalos and egret",
    "unidentified sources the authors found at most @xmath1 unidentified sources are possibly subhalos .",
    "however , location coincidence and variability cut even exclude further of these candidates @xcite . in @xcite assuming a similar population of subhalos between the milky way and m31 and using the upper limit of @xmath0-rays from m31 the authors found it is highly unlikely that a large fraction of these unidentified egret sources can be from subhalos . improving the upper limit may finally exclude this possibility @xcite .    the strong constraints on the possible detectable subhalos from these works @xcite will constrain the properties of dark matter particles . in the present work we assume that neutralino forms dark matter and work in the frame of supersymmetric extension of the standard model . assuming that none of the unidentified egret sources is from dark matter annihilation we will study how the properties of neutralino are constrained resorting to the numerical simulation result of dark matter clumps distribution .",
    "the non - detection of subhalos finally shows a constraint on the susy parameter space .",
    "the next generation satellite based experiment , glast @xcite , will greatly improve the sensitivity of egret .",
    "more @xmath0-ray sources will be detected by glast .",
    "detectability of @xmath0-rays from the subhalos by glast has been studied in literature @xcite .",
    "once such sources are detected , the follow - up study of the sources may measure the spectrum of the annihilated @xmath0-rays or even detect the line emission @xcite .",
    "these measurement will finally give strong implications on the properties of dark matter .",
    "however , there are also possibilities of null result for such searches , similar to the egret result or the null result of direct detection even though the direct detection has continuously improved sensitivities . in this case",
    "we would like to study how supersymmetry would be constrained .",
    "it is well known that the flux of gamma rays from the neutralino annihilation in a clump is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is annihilation cross section times relative velocity , @xmath4 is the differential flux in a single annihilation , @xmath5 is the mass of the dark matter particle , @xmath6 is the distance from the detector to the source .",
    "the flux depends on both the distribution of the dark matter @xmath7 and the particle nature of dark matter . in the next section",
    "we first give the intensity distribution of the subhalo @xmath0-ray sources according to the n - body simulation results .",
    "then in sec .",
    "iii we present the constraints on the susy parameter space from non - detection of the subhalo @xmath0-ray sources by egret and glast .",
    "we finally give a conclusion in sec .",
    "in this section we first present some simulation results about the subhalos and then we calculate the intensities of the mw subhalos as @xmath0-ray sources by neutralino annihilation .",
    "n - body simulations show that the radial distribution of substructures is generally shallower than the density profile of the smooth background due to the tidal disruption of substructures which is most effective near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the relative number density of subhalos is approximately given by an isothermal profile with a core @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the relative number density at the scale radius @xmath10 , with @xmath10 being about @xmath11 times the halo virial radius @xmath12 .",
    "the result given above agrees well with that in another recent simulation by gao et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the differential mass function of substructures has an approximate power law distribution , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite both the cluster and galaxy substructure cumulative mass functions are found to be an @xmath15 power law , @xmath16 , with no dependence on the mass of the parent halo .",
    "a slight difference is found in a simulation by gao _",
    "_ @xcite that the cluster substructure is more abundant than galaxy substructure since the cluster forms later and more substructures have survived the tidal disruption . the mass function for both scales",
    "are well fitted by @xmath17 .",
    "taking the power index of the differential mass function greater than @xmath18 makes the fraction of the total mass enclosed in subhalos insensitive to the mass of the minimal subhalo we take .",
    "the mass fraction of subhalos estimated in the literature is around between 5 percent to 20 percent @xcite . in this work",
    "we will take the differential index of @xmath19 and the mass fraction of substructures as 10 percent .    to calculate the @xmath0-ray intensities from the dark matter clumps",
    "we first realize a mw - like halo with a population of subhalos due to the subhalo distribution function from simulation , which is given above .",
    "the mass of the substructures are taken randomly between @xmath20 , which is the lowest substructure mass the present simulations can resolve @xcite , and the maximal mass @xmath21 .",
    "the maximal mass of substructures is taken to be @xmath22 since the mw halo does not show recent mergers of satellites with masses larger then @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux is quite insensitive to the minimum subhalo mass since the flux from a single subhalo scales with its mass @xcite .",
    "however , due to the finite spatial resolution of the n - body simulations the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) is an extrapolation of the subhalo distribution at large radius .",
    "the formula underestimates of the tidal effect which destroys most substructures near the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "we take the tidal effects into account under the `` tidal approximation '' , which assumes that all mass beyond the tidal radius is lost in a single orbit while keep its density profile inside the tidal radius intact .",
    "the tidal radius of the substructure is defined as the radius at which the tidal forces of the host exceeds the self gravity of the substructure .",
    "assuming that both the host and the substructure gravitational potential are given by point masses and considering the centrifugal force experienced by the substructure the tidal radius at the jacobi limit is given by @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distance of the substructure to the gc , @xmath26 refers to the mass within @xmath25 .",
    "the substructures with @xmath27 will be disrupted .",
    "the mass of a substructure is recalculated by subtracting the mass beyond the tidal radius in realizing the mw - like halos . after taking the tidal effects into account",
    "we find the substructures near the gc are disrupted completely .",

    "the concentration parameter is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the virial radius of the halo and @xmath35 is the radius at which the effective logarithmic slope of the profile is @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath36 . for the nfw profile we have @xmath37 , while for the moore profile we have @xmath38 .",

    "therefore the annihilation flux is very sensitive to the concentration parameter .",

    "the ` sensitivity ' means for some time exposure , for example , for one year , the minimal flux the source has in order to have a @xmath76 detection .    the sensitivity is not difficult to estimate for egret and glast , as given in @xcite .",

    "considering background at different latitudes and longer obervation time will certainly change the sensitivity .",
    "however , the exact values of the detector sensitivities are not very important , since the constraints on the susy parameter space given in the following can be simply rescaled with the sensitivity . from fig .",

    "a general practice in phenomenological studies is to assume some simple relations between the parameters and greatly reduce the number of free parameters . following the assumptions in darksusy",
    "@xcite we take seven free parameters in calculating dark matter production and annihilation , i.e. , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath102 , the wino mass parameter @xmath103 , the mass of the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath104 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath105 , the scalar fermion mass parameter @xmath106 , the trilinear soft breaking parameter @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "for the case of moore profile , sensitivity from gc observation is improved by two orders of magnitude , while only one order of magnitude improvement from subhalo observation .",
    "this means similar sensitivities will be achieved by observing the gc and subhalos . on the contrary ,",
    "subhalos provide a clean environment to search for the annihilation signals .",
    "especially recent simulation shows that the dm profiles may not be universal .",
    "smaller subhalos may have steeper central cusp @xcite .",
    ". gave the cusp index @xmath134 for halos of @xmath135 to @xmath136 with a large scatter .",
    "in this case , if taking the gc the nfw profile and the subhalos the moore profile , the @xmath0-ray fluxes from the subhalos may even be greater than that from the gc .",
    "we expect these sources can be detected by the satellite based experiments , such as egret and glast .",
    "once such sources are detected we can learn a lot about the nature of dark matter particles by studying its luminosity and spectrum of the annihilation .",
    "however , study shows that most of the egret unidentified @xmath0-ray sources should not be of dark matter origin @xcite . in this work",
    "we study how the egret and glast can constrain the susy models if none of the subhalo @xmath0-ray sources are detected in the two experiments .",
    "we first realize one hundred mw - like halos with subhalos whose distribution is given according to the n - body simulation results . in each realization",
    "we calculate the @xmath0-ray flux from the subhalos by fixing the particle factor .",
    "then we give the average cumulative number of the subhalo @xmath0-ray sources as function of their flux intensities .",
    "once the sensitivity of detectors , such egret and glast , are known , we know the detectable number of this kind of @xmath0-ray sources . by requiring the detectable number smaller than @xmath77 at egret and glast we put a constraint on the susy parameter space .",
    "our result shows that the egret has already given a moderate constraint on the susy parameter space if we assume none of the unidentified @xmath0-ray sources are from subhalos .",
    "the glast can greatly enhance the constraints .",
    "however , a large uncertainty comes from the simulation , especially the property of subhalos in a dense environment .",
    "convergence of the subhalos property in the future high resolution simulation will lead to more precise constraint on the nature of dark matter particles .",
