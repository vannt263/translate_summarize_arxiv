    "for more than three decades eliashberg theory @xcite has been the standard theory to compute quantitative properties of superconductors like the critical temperature . for a review",
    "we refer to @xcite . the basic advantage of eliashberg theory compared to bcs ",
    "theory @xcite is that it provides a framework to treat real phonon spectra and strong electron  phonon coupling",
    ". the critical temperature of a superconductor can be calculated with great accuracy @xcite .",
    "eliashberg theory is based on a description in terms of green s functions .",
    "it becomes exact in the limit where the electron mass is small compared to ion masses .    in the past ten years , several new developments like the discovery of high@xmath0 materials @xcite and heavy fermions ( for a recent theoretical review see @xcite ) stimulated research activities in strongly correlated systems @xcite .",
    "theories of strongly correlated systems are usually based on a hamiltonian description , which is the natural basis to investigate properties of bound states . if one wants to investigate the effect of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction in strongly correlated systems , one has to set up a model hamiltonian that contains phononic degrees of freedom .",
    "the main problem is that the standard eliashberg theory can not be applied to such models , because it can not be formulated in a hamiltonian framework .",
    "there are also other difficulties , for instance in heavy fermion systems , where the mass of the quasi - particles becomes comparable to the ion masses , so that eliashberg theory is no longer applicable . despite years of effort , our understanding of electron  phonon interactions in strongly correlated systems",
    "is rather poor .",
    "the major problem is that one needs a theoretical method based on a hamiltonian description that allows an accurate treatment of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction .",
    "bcs  theory is based on a hamiltonian approach , but it does not contain the electron  phonon interaction explicitely . most of the properties of superconductors can be understood using bcs  theory .",
    "but one of the problems of bcs ",
    "theory is that the characteristic energy scale that determines the critical temperature @xmath0 of the superconductor or the gap can not be calculated .",
    "the famous bcs ",
    "formula @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the debye temperature and @xmath3 is the strength of the interaction , has to be used to determine the parameter @xmath4 from @xmath0 .",
    "usually it is argued that the problems of bcs  theory are due to the fact that retardation effects in the interaction are neglected @xcite .",
    "this viewpoint is possible if one has a theory in terms of green s functions in mind like the eliashberg  theory . in a hamiltonian framework one usually works with instantaneous interactions . from a viewpoint based on a hamiltonian the problem of bcs ",
    "theory is that the effective hamiltonian has to be obtained from an initial hamiltonian containing electrons and phonons .",
    "the effective electron",
    " electron interaction bardeen _",
    "@xcite had in mind was the phonon ",
    "induced interaction of frhlich @xcite or bardeen and pines @xcite .",
    "these interactions are constructed perturbatively . but regarding the energy scales in the problem it is clear that a perturbative approach must fail .",
    "the initial hamiltonian is dominated by the electronic energies , which are typically of the order of a few ev .",
    "further it contains phonons with an energy scale of the order 10mev .",
    "superconductivity arises due to a marginal relevant operator , the phonon  induced electron ",
    "electron interaction .",
    "the relevant energy scale in this problem is set by the critical temperature , which is typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than the phonon energies .",
    "thus , if one wants to obtain accurate values for the critical temperature , one has to resolve an energy scale which is about five orders of magnitude smaller than the typical energy scale in the initial hamiltonian .",
    "this means that one needs a renormalization procedure which allows to calculate an effective renormalized hamiltonian from the initial hamiltonian to high accuracy .",
    "a general renormalization procedure for hamiltonians has not been available for long time , although in his first paper on renormalization wilson treated a hamiltonian problem @xcite .",
    "the only accurate renormalization procedure for hamiltonians was numerical renormalization , which could be applied to fermionic single impurity problems .",
    "three years ago , a new method for calculating effective hamiltonians has been proposed by wegner @xcite .",
    "it uses continuous unitary transformations to calculate an effective hamiltonian from a given initial one .",
    "this method has been called _",
    "flow equations for hamiltonians_. it has been applied successfully to single impurity problems @xcite and to dissipative quantum systems @xcite . independently of wegner , glazek and wilson @xcite proposed a similar method , _",
    "similarity renormalization_. they use continuous unitary transformations to renormalize a given hamiltonian .",
    "the aim of wilson _ et al . _ is to treat light ",
    "front qcd @xcite .",
    "recently brisudov _ et al .",
    "_ calculated quarkonium spectra using this method @xcite . both methods have a large range of possible applications in many particle physics .",
    "the aim of this work is to show that reliable quantitative results can be obtained with the framework of renormalization of hamiltonians .",
    "both methods , flow equations and similarity renormalization , have been applied to the electron ",
    "phonon problem @xcite . lenz and wegner used the flow equations to calculate the effective electron ",
    "electron interaction .",
    "their result differs significantly from the one obtained by frhlich @xcite or bardeen and pines @xcite .",
    "the interaction within a cooper pair they obtained has no singularity and is attractive in the whole parameter space .",
    "in @xcite i applied the similarity renormalization scheme to the electron  phonon problem .",
    "the effective interaction one obtains is similar to the one calculated by lenz and wegner .",
    "furthermore , the single particle energies in the original hamiltonian are renormalized .",
    "i calculated the critical temperature for a simple einstein model .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that @xmath0 can be calculated for realistic phonon spectra using this method .",
    "the results agree very well with results from eliashberg theory and with experimental data .",
    "our starting point is the standard hamiltonian for the electron  phonon problem @xmath5 with @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons .",
    "i have not included spin and band indices , but this can be done without difficulty . @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the creation and annihilation operators for phonons , here as well different acoustical and optical branches can be introduced .",
    "the colons denote normal ordering . in @xcite",
    "i showed how this problem can be treated using similarity renormalization .",
    "the basis of this approach is a continuous unitary transformation applied to the hamiltonian .",
    "the transformation can be written in the form @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "@xmath13 is a ultra  violett cutoff , and the generator @xmath14 is chosen so that off  diagonal matrix elements vanish in @xmath15 if the corresponding energy difference is larger than @xmath13 .",
    "details of this method in the present context are explained in @xcite , a general description can be found in @xcite . during the transformation",
    "the electron ",
    "phonon coupling is eliminated successively and an effective electron  electron interaction is generated .",
    "the final result is an effective hamiltonian that contains an electronic part of the form @xmath16 a part describing the phononic degrees of freedom and a weak electron ",
    "phonon coupling .",
    "the remaining electron ",
    "phonon coupling contains a small part of the initial electron  phonon coupling and other couplings involving two or more phonons . in @xcite these couplings",
    "have been neglected since they are of higher order in the coupling constant @xmath17 . in principle",
    "it is possible to eliminate these couplings as well .",
    "this yields an additional contribution to the induced electron ",
    "electron interaction that is also of higher order .",
    "in the following we will analyse the properties of the electronic subsystem described by the renormalized hamiltonian ( [ hr ] ) using bcs  theory . to do this we use the well known bcs gap equation",
    "@xmath18 it contains the interaction @xmath19 of two electrons forming a cooper pair . in standard bcs ",
    "theory this interaction is often approximated by a constant in a small energy interval around the fermi surface .",
    "the result of frhlich @xcite for this interaction is attractive in a small region around the fermi surface , it has a divergency due to a vanishing energy denominator and becomes repulsive in the rest of the parameter space . in contrary , the result by lenz and wegner @xcite is attractive in the whole parameter space , it is of the form @xmath20 .",
    "similarity renormalization yields a similar result , @xmath21 @xcite . in the isotropic case , and introducing the renormalized density of states @xmath22 , the sum in ( [ gap ] ) can be replaced by an integral .",
    "furthermore , the electron  phonon coupling can be described by the standard eliashberg function @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the gap equation can then be written in the form @xmath24 the factor @xmath25 is due to the definition of @xmath26 , which contains a factor @xmath27 . as a further approximation",
    "we replace the electronic density of states @xmath22 by a constant @xmath28 .",
    "since the electronic energies that enter in ( [ gap ] ) are renormalized , this has to be taken into account . as in eliashberg",
    "theory @xcite , similarity renormalization yields a renormalization of the electron energies @xmath29 @xcite close to the fermi surface .",
    "therefore the renormalized density of states @xmath27 at the fermi surface can be replaced by @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath13 is the usual coupling strength in the theory of superconductivity , defined as @xmath31 . in a first step we use ( [ gap2 ] ) to determine @xmath0 for weak coupling .",
    "if @xmath32 is close to @xmath0 , one can replace @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "we let @xmath35 and use that @xmath36 is bounded , monotonic decreasing , and nonnegative .",
    "the second mean value theorem then yields @xmath37 keeping the leading logarithmic singularity this yields @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 can be obtained if one uses the second mean value theorem for @xmath40 and for @xmath41 .",
    "then one obtains @xmath42 ; @xmath43 , where the average @xmath44 is taken with respect to the weight function @xmath45 . taking into account that the density of states @xmath22 is not constant , one can introduce an additional constant in the argument of the exponential function . in this way",
    "one obtains a @xmath0 equation of the form @xmath46 it has the same form as the mcmillan equation @xcite . for small coupling ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48",
    "does not depend on the details of the phonon spectrum ; this has also been shown in the framework of eliashberg theory @xcite .    in order to obtain results for @xmath0 which can be compared with experimental data , one has to include the coulomb repulsion . in principle",
    "this can be done form the very beginning . for our purpose",
    "it is sufficient to include the pseudo coulomb potential @xcite @xmath49 by hand . with the assumption of a constant density of states the gap equation ( [ gap2 ] ) can then be written as @xmath50 for small coupling one can again derive a mcmillan  type formula . for small @xmath13 the critical temperature does not depend on the details of @xmath26 , but only on @xmath51 . to obtain accurate results ,",
    "the gap equation ( [ gap3 ] ) has to be solved numerically for a given form of the phonon spectrum . in fig .",
    "1 we show numerical results for @xmath0 in units of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath13 for various types of spectra and @xmath52 .",
    "the solid curve is the results for a spectrum of lead . here",
    "@xmath26 can be well approximated by a suitable sum of lorentzians @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that the @xmath53integral in ( [ gap3 ] ) can be calculated analytically .",
    "the remaining integral can easily be calculated numerically to obtain @xmath0 .",
    "the dotted curve is the result for an einstein spectrum and has already been shown already in @xcite .",
    "the dashed curve shows the result for a spectrum of mercury type .",
    "we have chosen these spectra since allen and dynes @xcite calculated @xmath0 for the same spectra in the framework of eliashberg theory .",
    "this allows a direct comparison with eliashberg theory .",
    "the corresponding curves lie slightly above our results , the difference is about 5% .",
    "we have included in our plot some experimental data also shown in @xcite .",
    "a similar calculation can be done using the effective phonon  induced electron ",
    "electron interaction obtained by lenz and wegner @xcite .",
    "the curves differ about 2% from the curves shown in fig .",
    "1 . for the einstein model ,",
    "this has already been observed in @xcite .    to 10 cm    one",
    "notices that our results are systematically a few percent too small compared to the results from eliashberg theory or to experimental data .",
    "the reason is probably that we neglected higher order terms in the effective hamiltonian that describe an interaction between electrons and two phonons . treating these terms in the same way as the electron ",
    "phonon interaction , one obtains an additional contribution to the effective electron  electron interaction , which is of fourth order in the initial electron  phonon coupling .",
    "this contribution is again attractive and will lead to a somewhat higher value of the critical temperature .",
    "our result shows that similarity renormalization or flow equations for hamiltonians yield an effective hamiltonian that contains the correct energy scale .",
    "the quantitative results are comparable to eliashberg theory .",
    "but these methods work in a hamiltonian framework , using continuous unitary transformations , and they do not rely on special properties like a small ratio of electron mass to ion masses . therefore one may hope that the analytical treatment of electron  phonon interactions in strongly correlated systems is as well possible using these methods .    from the viewpoint of eliashberg theory or of a field theoretical approach based on a lagrangian , where the phonons can be integrated out explicitely , a problem may still be that the effective interaction we calculated contains no retardation effects .",
    "but it should be pointed out that a quantity like @xmath0 or the energy gap is not a dynamical quantity , but a spectral property of the hamiltonian .",
    "dynamical correlation functions of some observable can be calculated as well using continuous unitary transformations .",
    "one has to take the transformation of the observable into account .",
    "this has been shown in a recent investigation of dissipative quantum systems in a hamiltonian framework @xcite . using flow equations for hamiltonians one can obtain accurate quantitative results for dynamical low temperature correlation functions as well ."
