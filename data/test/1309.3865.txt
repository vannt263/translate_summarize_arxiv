    "since the mid 1970 s the existence of heavy hadronic molecules ( composed by a pair of heavy hadrons instead of a pair of heavy quarks ) has been theorized@xcite .",
    "this assumption was made based on the similarities between the heavy meson - heavy antimeson system and the deuteron .",
    "however , it was not until the discovery of the @xmath0@xcite by the belle collaboration , in 2003 , that the first experimental data that could fit into that molecular scheme was found .",
    "since then , many other xyz states have been found , being the @xmath1 also natural candidates to have a molecular structure ..    besides , the @xmath2 limit of qcd simplifies the theory so a set of symmetries are induced .",
    "probably , the most important symmetries induced in this limit are hqss , hfs , and hads .",
    "we make use of them , along with the assumptions of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 to be heavy hadronic molecules , to obtain a family of heavy meson - doubly heavy baryons that could also be interpreted as triply heavy pentaquarks .",
    "this proceeding is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly introduced our eft based on hqss and hfs that we will use in the analysis of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 .",
    "second , we will discuss hads and its implications .",
    "finally , our results will be shown in table [ tab : predictions ] .",
    "in this work we are following the scheme described in @xcite where all sort of details can be found . at lowest order , hqss and hfs",
    "impose that the dynamics of the model does not depend on either the mass or the spin of the heavy quark . taking this into account , the most general potential that describes the dynamics of the heavy meson - antimeson pair depends only in four low energy constants or counter - terms ( lecs ) , up to corrections of the order @xmath3 : @xmath4 tr\\left[{h}^{(\\bar{q } ) } \\bar{h}^{(\\bar{q } ) } \\gamma^{\\mu } \\right ] + \\\\ \\nonumber { } & & + \\frac{c_{a}^{\\lambda}}{4}~ tr\\left[\\bar{h}^{(q)}_{a } \\lambda^{i}_{ab } { h}^{(q)}_{b } \\gamma_{\\mu } \\right ] tr\\left[{h}^{(\\bar{q})}_{c } \\lambda^{i}_{cd}\\bar{h}^{(\\bar{q})}_{d }",
    "\\gamma^{\\mu } \\right ]   + \\\\",
    "\\nonumber { } & & + \\frac { c_{b}}{4}~ tr\\left[\\bar{h}^{(q)}{h}^{(q ) } \\gamma_{\\mu } \\gamma_{5 } \\right ] tr\\left[{h}^{(\\bar{q } ) } \\bar{h}^{(\\bar{q } ) } \\gamma^{\\mu } \\gamma_{5}\\right ] + \\\\ & & +   \\frac{c_{b}^{\\lambda}}{4}~ tr\\left[\\bar{h}^{(q)}_{a } \\lambda_{ab}^{j}{h}^{(q)}_{b } \\gamma_{\\mu } \\gamma_{5 } \\right ] tr\\left[{h}^{(\\bar{q})}_{c } \\lambda^{j}_{cd } \\bar{h}^{(\\bar{q})}_{d } \\gamma^{\\mu } \\gamma_{5}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] being @xmath5 the gell - mann matrices and @xmath6 the meson ( antimeson ) field in the charm sector ( and viceversa in the bottom sector ) .",
    "moreover , the four lecs will be rewritten through a linear combination into @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 for notation .",
    "these four lecs will be fitted to reproduce some experimental data in our scheme . in this framework",
    ", bound states will be found by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation as they will appear as poles in the t - matrix : @xmath11 , and the ultraviolet divergences of the loop function are treated introducing a gaussian regulator in the propagator and in the potential such as :    @xmath12    these assumptions determine three linear combinations of the lecs , that is : @xmath13 and @xmath14 which in turn are determined by the @xmath0 ( for more details , see @xcite ) and @xmath15 by the @xmath16 resonances [ @xcite ] .",
    "up to now , we have only established an eft that analyzes heavy meson - heavy antimeson molecules . in order to use this approach to different systems we will take advantage of the heavy antiquark - diquark symmetry ( hads ) .",
    "this @xmath17 limit symmetry , first introduced by savage and wise , states that a heavy diquark behaves as a heavy antiquark up to corrections of the order @xmath18 , , being v the velocity of the heavy quarks .    furthermore ,",
    "since the dynamics of our eft only depends on the light degrees of freedom , that are the same than in the heavy meson - heavy antimeson system , we can make use of some racah algebra ( similar to @xcite ) to obtain the potentials in every possible channels , which are displayed in table [ tab : potentials ] .",
    "the @xmath19 states are those where heavy quarks in the baryon are coupled to @xmath20 ( which is forbidden if the two quarks are the same because of the pauli s principle of exclusion )",
    ".    then we just have to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation in each channel using the lecs we have previously fitted to obtain the results of table [ tab : predictions ] .",
    "the isoscalar states are related to the @xmath0 .",
    "the isovector states are determined by the @xmath21 and the isovector component of the @xmath0 .",
    "the sources of error in the analysis are : the masses of the @xmath0 and @xmath22 resonances , the ratio of the @xmath0 amplitude decays ( calculated in @xcite ) and the two eft expansions used in this work . the errors for hqss are taken to be @xmath23 in the charm ( bottom ) sector and @xmath24 $ ] in the charm ( charm - bottom ) [ bottom ] sector for hads .",
    "then , an unique error is obtained by adding in quadratures all different sources .",
    "as a summary , we can conclude that our analysis based on several qcd symmetries in the @xmath17 limit predicts the existence of several heavy meson - doubly heavy baryon molecular partners of the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 .",
    "this same effective field theory approach could also be extended to study doubly heavy baryon - double heavy antibaryon molecular systems in the future .",
