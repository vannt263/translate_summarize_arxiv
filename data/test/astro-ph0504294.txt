    "the paradigm of _ inflation _",
    "@xcite emerged in the early eighties as a way of resolving a number of outstanding puzzles in cosmology , by postulating that the universe underwent a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "inflationary models predict that the universe is spatially flat , and that the quantum zero - point fluctuations of the space - time metric produce a nearly scale invariant spectrum of density perturbations that are responsible for the formation of cosmic structures and the generation of a primordial cosmic gravitational wave background ( cgwb ) .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , most recently with wmap , have provided a confirmation of the first two predictions  @xcite ; the generation of primordial gravitational waves is still to be verified .",
    "this test is important for both cosmology and fundamental physics .",
    "in fact , the actual detailed implementation of an inflationary model requires the introduction of additional fields that are not part of the already experimentally well tested standard model of particle physics and may produce effects at energy scales well beyond those probed by particle physics experiments .",
    "the observation of a cgwb either directly , with gravitational wave instruments , or indirectly , via the effect on the cmb provides a unique way of measuring the physical parameters of the models and an opportunity for testing new ideas in fundamental physics and cosmology .",
    "inflation predicts a quasi - scale invariant cgwb between @xmath1  hz and @xmath21  ghz whose spectrum @xmath3 ( the fractional energy density in gravitational waves , normalised to the critical density , per unit logarithmic frequency interval ) does not exceed @xmath4 at any one frequency  @xcite .",
    "third generation ground - based km - scale laser interferometers are expected to achieve a sensitivity @xmath5 in the frequency range @xmath6  hz - a few @xmath7  hz ( cf  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "as the characteristic amplitude @xmath8 on a bandwidth @xmath9 produced by a stochastic background is    @xmath10    there is an obvious advantage in observing at lower frequencies .",
    "unfortunately , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite will not offer an opportunity to improve ( much ) beyond the sensitivity of ground - based detectors because of the instrument s limitations  only one interferometer , preventing cross - correlation experiments  and the intensity of astrophysical foregrounds in the mhz frequency band  @xcite , where lisa achieves optimal sensitivity .",
    "it is currently accepted that a lisa follow - up mission aimed at the lowest possible frequency band not compromised by astrophysical foregrounds , @xmath11 represents the best opportunity to directly study inflation . as a result of this ,",
    "a new mission concept has recently emerged : the big - bang - observer ( bbo ) , which is presently being investigated by nasa  @xcite .",
    "this consists of a constellation of four interferometers in a heliocentric orbit at 1 au from the sun . by making the arm length of the bbo interferometers @xmath12 shorter than those of lisa",
    ", the centre of the observational window is shifted to several @xmath13 hz ; improved technology for lasers , optics and drag - free systems will allow to achieve a sensitivity @xmath14 . a similar mission , although consisting of only one interferometer , has been proposed in japan : decigo  @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves produced during inflation will also have an indirect effect on the structure of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by affecting most importantly its polarisation  @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the signature of gws has been one of the drivers in the design of planck  @xcite , an esa mission currently scheduled for launch in 2007 ; moreover vigorous efforts are underway to design and develop more ambitious instruments , such as cmbpol  @xcite , in order to carry out highly sensitive searches .",
    "the programme to test the prediction of the generation of a gravitational wave stochastic background during inflation relies therefore on substantial sensitivity improvements for mission either in the gravitational wave or microwave band ( cf _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate how the direct observation of primordial gravitational waves by bbo can constrain the parameter space of inflationary models and what are the implications for the design of a mission .",
    "we also explore how such information compare with and complement those that can be gained with future cmb data .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we review single - field slow - roll inflation , the spectrum @xmath15 of the cosmic gravitational wave background that is generated in this epoch and show that @xmath15 can be characterised by only two unknown parameters ; in section  [ sec : results ] we discuss the region of the parameter space that can be probed by the big - bang - observer mission , and how this depends on different technological choices for the mission ; we also compare and contrast this results with what one might be able to achieve with future cmb observations , with missions such as planck and cmbpol ; section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions and pointers to future work .",
    "in this section we briefly review a class of inflationary models where the period of accelerating cosmological expansion is described by a single dynamical parameter , the inflation field ( see e.g. @xcite ) and derive an expression for the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves as a function of the model parameters .",
    "such analysis can be generalised to multi - field inflationary models , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt geometrical units in which @xmath16 .",
    "the dynamics of a homogeneous and isotropic scalar field @xmath17 in a cosmological background described by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric is determined by the equation of motion    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the scale factor , @xmath20 the expansion rate and @xmath21 the scalar field potential ; in the previous equation dots refer to time derivatives and primes to derivatives with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath19 is encoded into the friedmann equation ,    @xmath22 \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath23  gev is the planck mass .",
    "inflation is a period of accelerated expansion where @xmath24 which implies that the _ slow - roll parameters _ ,    @xmath25    must be less than 1 .",
    "inflation generates two types of metric perturbations : ( i ) _ scalar or curvature perturbations _ , coupled to the energy momentum tensor of the matter fields , that constitute the seeds for structure formation and for the observed anisotropy of the cmb and ( ii ) _ tensor or gravitational wave perturbations _ that , at first order , do not couple with the matter fields .",
    "tensor perturbations are responsible for a cgwb . in the slow - roll regime ( @xmath26 ) , the power spectra of curvature and tensor perturbations are given by @xmath27 ^ 2_{k = ah } \\",
    ", , \\label{deltar}\\\\ \\delta^2_t & = & \\frac{16}{\\pi } \\left ( \\frac{h}{m_{pl } } \\right)^2_{k = ah } \\ , , \\label{deltat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are functions of the comoving wavenumber @xmath30 evaluated when a given mode crosses the causal horizon @xmath31 .",
    "the spectral slopes of the scalar and tensor perturbations are then given by @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 can also be written in terms of the slow - roll parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 as @xmath37 for single field slow - roll inflationary models the full set of metric perturbations is described in terms of the quantities @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are however not independent . using equations  ( [ epsilon])-([deltat]),([newns ] ) and  ( [ newnt ] )",
    "one finds the consistency relation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the so - called tensor - to - scalar ratio .    the spectrum of a cosmological gravitational wave stochastic background is defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the gravitational waves energy density , @xmath44 is the physical frequency and @xmath45 is the critical energy density today .",
    "@xmath46 is the hubble parameter and @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 is independent of the value of the hubble constant .    for the class of single - field ,",
    "slow - roll inflationary models considered here , the spectrum of a cgwb is given by  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the redshift of matter - radiation equality and @xmath51 a reference frequency . in order to be consistent with the recent analysis carried out by the wmap team , in this paper",
    "we choose @xmath52  hz , corresponding to a wavenumber @xmath53 . using the equations  ( [ consist ] ) and  ( [ ratio ] ) ,",
    "the spectrum  ( [ spectrum ] ) can be written as  @xcite @xmath54 \\ , , \\label{newspectrum}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 \\right\\ } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath56 . in equation  ( [ newspectrum ] )",
    "the parameter @xmath57 accounts for the power spectrum normalisation with respect to the cobe results : this parameter is currently constrained by the measurements of cmb anisotropy to @xmath58  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "since the gw spectrum is extrapolated over a wide range of scales , in equation  ( [ newspectrum ] ) we have included the first order correction for the running of the tensor spectral slope .",
    "notice that equation  ( [ newspectrum ] ) is valid provided that @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , equation  ( [ newspectrum ] ) gives @xmath62 , where we have set @xmath63 . for single - field inflationary models @xmath15 is therefore described by two `` primordial parameters '' , @xmath33 and @xmath64 , and one parameter @xmath57 which encodes the effects due to the late cosmological evolution , such as the nature of the dark energy component . in this paper",
    "we set @xmath63 and consider the gravitational wave spectrum @xmath15 as described by two unknown parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath64 , that need to be determined by observations .",
    "the big - bang - observer is presently envisaged as a constellation of four 3-arm space - based interferometers on the same heliocentric orbit at the vertices of an equilateral triangle , with two interferometers co - located and rotated by @xmath65 at one of the vertices .",
    "the arm length of the interferometers is about @xmath66 km ( a hundredth of the lisa arm length ) corresponding to a peak sensitivity at @xmath0  hz .",
    "different parameters have been suggested for the instrument , which in turn correspond to different sensitivities ; following  @xcite we consider three possible choices , that we summarise in table  [ tab : bbo - param ] ; we call the corresponding mission concept as `` bbo - lite '' , `` bbo - standard '' and `` bbo - grand '' . in this section",
    "we explore the region of the parameter space @xmath67 that can be probed with an instrument of the bbo class and how it depends on the instrumental parameters ; we also compare the sensitivity of a gravitational wave mission with the information that can be obtained indirectly from cmb observations using wmap , planck  @xcite and cmbpol  @xcite .",
    "gravitational wave searches for stochastic backgrounds are optimally carried out by cross - correlating the data sets recorded at different instruments , which allows to disentangle the common stochastic contribution of a cgwb from the ( supposedly uncorrelated ) contribution from the instrumental noise  @xcite .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio can be efficiently built only when the separation of two instruments is smaller than ( half of ) the typical wavelength of the waves ( in the bbo case @xmath68  cm ) , and therefore only the co - located instruments can be used in the bbo mission to carry out highly sensitive searches of stochastic signals .",
    "the other interferometers of the constellation allow to accurately identify individual sources and subtract any contaminating radiation from the data streams . assuming that the noise of the instruments is uncorrelated , stationary and gaussian , the optimal signal - to - noise ratio @xmath69 that can be achieved is  @xcite    @xmath70^{1/2 } \\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & 3 \\ , \\left ( \\frac{h_0 ^ 2\\omega_\\mathrm{gw}}{10^{-15 } } \\right ) \\ , \\left [ \\left ( \\frac{\\delta f}{1 \\ , \\mathrm{hz } } \\right ) \\ , \\left ( \\frac{t}{10 ^ 8 \\ , \\mathrm{s } } \\right ) \\ , \\right]^{1/2 } \\left ( \\frac{f}{1 \\ , \\mathrm{hz } } \\right)^{-3 } \\ , \\left ( \\frac{s_h}{10^{-48 } \\ , \\mathrm{hz}^{-1 } } \\right)^{-1 } \\ , , \\label{eqn : snr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 is the power spectral density of the detectors noise  in the remaining of the paper we assume the instruments to have identical sensitivity and therefore set @xmath72 ",
    "@xmath73 is the integration time , @xmath9 is the effective bandwidth over which the signal - to - noise ratio is accumulated and @xmath74 is the overlap reduction function  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : bbo - param ] we report the frequency at which the noise of bbo reaches the minimum and the corresponding value of @xmath75 , depending on the choice of the instrumental parameters .",

    "the parameters of the signal model have been chosen in the range @xmath89 and @xmath90 and satisfy the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) . we have assumed an effective integration time of 3 years and the noise spectral density has been derived using the sensitivity curve generator for space - borne gravitational wave observatories  @xcite with the parameters reported in table  [ tab : bbo - param ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : snr ] summarises the results and compare them with the current upper - limits on @xmath33 and @xmath64 which have been inferred from the analysis of the wmap data  @xcite .",
    "the first interesting result is that the bbo - lite configuration would not be able to improve our understanding of standard inflation beyond what is already known ; in fact the sensitivity of bbo - lite is broadly comparable to the limit currently set by wmap .",
    "this has an immediate implication on the technology programme that will lead to a bbo - like mission : the parameters reported in table  [ tab : bbo - param ] for bbo - lite are simply too conservative and would not allow us to achieve the mission science goal .     and @xmath33 ( see section 2 ) that can be detected ( corresponding to a false alarm alarm probability of @xmath91 and false dismissal rate of @xmath92 ) . the magenta , yellow and red regions correspond to the limits obtained in a 3 yr long observation with bbo - lite , bbo - standard , and bbo - grand , respectively .",
    "the solid line correspond to the present best upperlimit set by wmap observations  , height=453 ]    on the other hand the bbo - standard configuration is able to probe the entire range of @xmath33 and to reach values of the scalar - to - tensor ratio @xmath93 for a 1% false alarm and 10% false dismissal rate ; by adopting the bbo - grand configuration it would be possible to do even better and reach @xmath94 .",
    "notice that for @xmath61 , the minimum value of the scalar - to - tensor ratio @xmath95 that can be observed scales as @xmath96 , every other parameter being equal .",
    "not surprisingly a dedicated mission such as bbo would improve our ability of probing the range of unknown parameters by ( roughly ) three orders of magnitudes , with respect to current limits .",
    "however , cmb experiments such as planck ( 2007 ) and , in the more distant future , cmbpol will also be in a position of searching for the signature of a cgwb and it is worth comparing the sensitivity that can be achieved by means of indirect observations with the bbo results .    in order to make this comparison , we have determined the theoretical confidence intervals on the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath64 by computing the corresponding fisher information matrix for planck and cmbpol , including both the polarisation and the temperature anisotropy cmb spectra .",
    "more in detail , we have assumed as cosmology the best - fit model consistent with wmap data  @xcite and we have marginalised with respect the ionisation optical depth in order to take into account its effect on the b - mode polarisation . for planck , we have assumed an average pixel sensitivity of @xmath97k and @xmath98k for the temperature and polarisation anisotropies respectively , while for cmbpol the corresponding noise levels are reduced by a factor 40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp ] summarises the results : we show the regions in the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath67 corresponding to the 68% and 95% confidence level for the null hypothesis ( i.e.  no cgwb ) for planck and cmbpol and compare it with the limit of bbo and bbo - grand observations , respectively ( those reported in figure  [ fig : snr ] ) .",
    "one important caveat is that the results that we have presented so far , both for direct and indirect observations , are computed assuming that the only factor limiting the sensitivity of the instruments is the intrinsic noise of the detectors , whereas other effects could actually provide the limitation .",
    "astrophysical foregrounds and radiation from individual gw sources can limit the sensitivity of bbo .",
    "stochastic foregrounds are produced by the incoherent superposition of radiation from large populations of astrophysical sources .",
    "foregrounds are particularly dangerous , because they provide a _ fundamental _ sensitivity limit for the mission  @xcite . in the bbo band ,",
    "the strongest contributions , according to our present astrophysical understanding come from rotating neutron stars and supernovae generated by population iii objects@xcite .",
    "foregrounds from rotating neutron stars should not be a serious limitation , as their contribution to the spectrum is @xmath99 .",
    "on the other hand supernovae from population iii objects could be a very serious obstacle to achieve high sensitivity and might overwhelm the signal produced by inflation .",
    "in fact they could produce a foreground with intensity @xmath100 at @xmath101  hz .",
    "for comparison this is equivalent to a cgwb with @xmath102 .",
    "even assuming that no foreground is sufficiently strong to compete with the signal from inflation , deterministic signals , primarily from binary neutron stars up to high redshift , will be present in the data set and need to be identified and removed to a high degree of precision in order not to introduce spurious effects .",
    "on the other hand the sensitivity of cmb experiments to primordial gravitational waves strongly depends on the distinctive signature produced by a cgwb on the b - mode of the cmb polarisation .",
    "indeed the b - mode polarisation is a particular sensitive probe of primordial tensor perturbations , since it does not receive contributions from primordial density perturbations .",
    "however , gravitational lensing by cosmological structure also generates a b - mode component in the cmb polarisation  @xcite and such foreground can not be fully subtracted .",
    "the lensing contamination poses a fundamental limit on the sensitivity to a b - mode component due to primordial gravitational waves , corresponding to a lower limit on the scalar - to - tensor ratio @xmath64 of about @xmath103  @xcite .",
    "the direct detection of a cosmological gravitational wave stochastic background produced during inflation is of great importance for the understanding of early universe cosmology and shall provide a direct test of one of the fundamental , and not yet probed predictions of inflationary theories . in this paper",
    "we have explored the sensitivity of the big - bang - observer mission to backgrounds generated by slow - roll , single field inflationary models and compared it with indirect limits that future cmb missions , such as planck and cmbpol are expected to set .",
    "our analysis shows that mild technological improvements considered for the bbo - lite configuration would not meet the science goals of a dedicated gravitational wave interferometric mission ; on the other hand the ambitious choices of the instrumental parameters for the standard and grand configuration of bbo would allow us to achieve a sensitivity @xmath104 in the frequency band @xmath11 .",
    "this value is broadly comparable with what could be achieved by one of the inflationary probes for cmb observations , such as cmbpol that are currently being discussed .",
    "it is however important to stress that throughout this paper we have assumed that the effect of foreground emission from unresolved sources and/or lensing would have a negligible impact on the sensitivity of the missions .",
    "this hypothesis is useful to gain an insight into the ultimate performance of the experiments , but its range of validity needs to be careful investigated . for direct gravitational wave observations it is clear that at some point astrophysical foregrounds will provide the fundamental sensitivity limit .",
    "what is the level at which this can occur and the consequences on our ability of testing prediction needs to be parametrised as a function of our ( still poor ) knowledge of the relevant astrophysical scenarios .",
