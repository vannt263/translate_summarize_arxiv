    "understanding the role and evolution of magnetic fields in clusters of galaxies is of significant importance for many questions including the origin of cluster magnetic fields , the interaction of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with the intracluster medium ( icm ) , and physical processes operating within the icm plasma .",
    "one of the key techniques used to obtain information about the strength and structure of cluster magnetic fields is the analysis of faraday rotation from polarized radio sources located behind and within clusters .",
    "the faraday effect rotates the polarization plane of electromagnetic waves traveling through a magnetized plasma , by an amount proportional to the ( square of the ) wavelength , plasma density , and the strength of the field in the direction of propagation .",
    "the sources intrinsic polarization need not be known , as the effect can be observed as a characteristic wavelength - dependent rotation measure ( rm ) signature .",
    "observations of a few nearby clusters have established the presence of magnetic fields with typical strengths of @xmath0 in non - cool core clusters and in excess of 10@xmath1 in the centers of cool core clusters @xcite .",
    "detailed high resolution rm images of radio galaxies in merging and cooling core clusters indicate that the rm distribution is characterized by patchy structures of a few kpc in size",
    ". furthermore , the rm distribution appears in general in good agreement with the rm expected for magnetic fields geometry characterized by turbulent motions with a power - law power spectrum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for e.g. ) .",
    "this base of knowledge will be greatly enhanced by radio observatories such as the _ expanded very large array _ ( _ evla _ ) and _ square kilometer array _ ( _ ska _ ) , which will provide the sensitivity to study both background and embedded sources with sufficient density to map out the rm patterns in many and more distant clusters .",
    "this will allow to study the structure of magnetic field in `` quiescent '' regions of clusters , away from radio galaxies , as well as the effect of the radio - mode feedback in their vicinity .",
    "the interpretation of these results can strongly benefit from advances in the theoretical understanding of the dynamics of weakly magnetized , low density plasmas .",
    "the icm is a dilute plasma , i.e. , the gyro - frequency of both the electrons and the ions is much greater than the collision frequency .",
    "the principal effect of this is highly anisotropic thermal conduction that fundamentally alters the classical schwarzschild criterion for convection @xcite . under these circumstances ,",
    "the outer regions of clusters where temperature decreases with radius may become susceptible to a conduction - driven _ magneto - thermal instability _ ( mti ) .",
    "the properties of this instability have been studied in mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that mti can profoundly affect the temperature distribution in the outer regions of a cluster in only a few billion years , by re - orienting the lines of magnetic field to be preferentially radial , resulting in a thermal conduction at a high fraction of the spitzer conductivity .",
    "the temperature profile in the centers of cooling - core galaxy clusters makes them stable to mti .",
    "however , @xcite found that cooling cores are characterized by a sister _ heat - flux buoyancy instability _ ( hbi ) that arises in regions where temperature increases with radius .",
    "an initial investigation of nonlinear evolution of the hbi @xcite indicates that its primary effect is to re - orient the lines of magnetic field perpendicular to the temperature gradient , and thus strongly suppress heat conduction .",
    "the properties of hbi have been investigated in global 3-d models of isolated cooling core clusters @xcite .",
    "they suggest that , once the magnetic field lines have been wrapped into spherical surfaces surrounding the core , the effective thermal conduction is suppressed to a small fraction of the spitzer value , leading to insulation of the core from further conductive heating , and to a subsequent thermal collapse .",
    "very recently , @xcite discovered an associated pair of _ overstabilities _ that affect precisely those configurations that are stable to the well - established hbi and mti .",
    "they predict that configurations which tend to result from the non - linear evolution of the hbi have @xmath2-modes that are driven overstable by radiative loses .",
    "on the other hand , configurations which tend to result from the non - linear evolution of the mti have @xmath2-modes that are driven overstable by the conductive heat flux .",
    "the effects of these overstabilities for the icm plasma thermodynamics and the properties of magnetic field are yet to be understood .",
    "we do not consider them in this work and instead focus on mti and hbi instabilities .",
    "the combination of mti and hbi instabilities should lead to a characteristic structure of magnetic fields in some cooling core clusters .",
    "if these conduction - driven instabilities dominate the dynamics of the icm , the magnetic field lines would be preferentially oriented radially in the outer region and azimuthally within the cooling core .",
    "this may not be the case in all clusters  it has recently been shown that mhd instabilities can be overwhelmed by even moderate levels of driven turbulence @xcite , such as might result from sub - cluster mergers , motions of cluster member galaxies , or various forms of agn feedback .",
    "which ( if any ) physical mechanism dominates in the icm depends sensitively upon the magnitude and distribution of turbulence , which is currently only poorly understood .",
    "motivated by this question and guided by the mhd simulations , we have constructed 3-d models of clusters for two distinct cases and simulated the rm maps that might be observed with high sensitivity radio polarization measurements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the ingredients of our cluster models in   [ s_model ] and the main properties of derived rm maps in   [ s_rmmaps ] .",
    "we discuss the importance of depolarization and diffuse emission in",

    "hence , in a spherical polar coordinate system @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is aligned along the @xmath17-axis , the field structure within the cooling core , @xmath18  kpc , is described in terms of only @xmath19 and @xmath20 components @xcite : @xmath21 @xmath22 is chosen so that the value of the plasma parameter , @xmath23 , is constant everywhere within the cooling core region .",
    "this implies @xmath24 at the cluster center , the field strength in the range @xmath25 , and mean strength over the computational volume of @xmath26 . @xmath27",
    "kpc and @xmath28  kpc are the coherence lengths defining characteristic radial scales on which magnetic field vector changes direction .",
    "the magnetic field thus changes direction 8 to 26 times across the cool core radius .",
    "in addition to these two scales , equations  [ eq_btheta ] and [ eq_bphi ] also capture the field geometry expected to arise as a consequence of the hbi : field lines wrapped onto the spherical surfaces within the cool core .",
    "this implies that in model a magnetic field reversal also occurs on a range of spatial scales associated with the spheres of different radii and up to the size of the cool core , @xmath29  kpc .",
    "it follows that 400  kpc is the maximum scale for magnetic field fluctuations in model a.    the magnetic field structure outside of the cooling core , @xmath30 , is described by a radial component , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is defined from the condition @xmath33 .",
    "the simple analytic form for the field structure given by equations  satisfies the condition @xmath34 everywhere except at @xmath35 , where the field lines are transitioning from azimuthal to radial . in a realistic case ,",
    "this transition would be more gradual and also divergence free .",
    "we nevertheless expect that , except around @xmath36 , our model should capture the salient properties of the magnetic field of a cluster affected by mhd instabilities across a wide range of radii .    in our second model ( model b ) , magnetic field lines are randomly tangled reflecting a different physical scenario in which the field geometry is set by the action of isotropic turbulence .",
    "while this theoretical hypothesis is most likely idealized , it is physically motivated and well rooted in theoretical practice , so we use it as a control case to model a. following @xcite , we initialize the field geometry by defining a magnetic field potential in fourier space of @xmath37 , where each cartesian factor @xmath38 has an amplitude drawn from a gaussian distribution and a random phase , assuring uncorrelated modes . we convert this into real space via a three - dimensional fast fourier transform ( fft ) . the tangled magnetic field",

    "extrapolate the source counts at 1.4  ghz from @xmath61  mjy to the limiting flux density of @xmath62 using a power - law relation between the cumulative number of sources per square degree and polarized flux density , @xmath63 .",
    "the exponent @xmath64 can take a range of values between 0.7 and 1.1 , which correspond to the low and high bounds for the source counts at a given flux limit at 1.4  ghz .",
    "we consider exposure times of 9h in case of _ evla _ and 1h and 100h for _ ska _ , both in the low and high source count scenarios , thus obtaining a total of six different observational scenarios for both models a and b. in table  [ table ] we list the total number of background polarized sources ( @xmath65 ) with polarized flux densities @xmath66 above the noise , within a @xmath67 area centered on the cluster .",
    "also shown is the mean separation between the sources ( @xmath68 ) at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "note that in the estimation of the number of background polarized sources we simply extrapolated the number of sources from @xmath69  mjy down to the microjy and nanojy flux densities .",
    "the nature of the dominant population of sources that _ evla _ and _ ska _ will detect at such low flux densities is uncertain , as they lie beneath the surface of the deepest radio surveys that are currently available .",
    "it has been proposed that microjy and nanojy sky is dominated by radio - quiet agn and star - forming galaxies @xcite as well as faint ellipticals and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also worth pointing out a simplification in our modeling which stems from an assumption that all background polarized sources are point like , while in reality some low redshift background sources will have a resolved extended structure .",
    "we nevertheless expect these to comprise a small fraction , as a majority of sources are expected to reside at high redshifts .",
    "the polarization of electromagnetic waves traveling through the cluster s magnetic field is rotated by an angle @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the observing wavelength and @xmath17 is the redshift of the faraday screen .",
    "we calculate the effect of this faraday rotation for our model cluster by numerically integrating the expression rm@xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the electron number density in units of @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the vector of magnetic field in @xmath76 , and * l * is the vector demarking the depth of the magnetic screen in kiloparsecs as measured along the line of sight of an observer placed at infinity , at an arbitrary orientation with respect to the cluster .",
    "the result is a two dimensional , continuous map of rm intensity with @xmath77 resolution shown in figure  [ fig_mapsab ] .",
    "we convolve this map with a map of point like , randomly distributed polarized background sources , where the number of sources in the map is @xmath65 . for visual representation in figures  [ fig_evla ] , [ fig_hbi ] , and [ fig_kolmog ]",
    "the convolved maps are smoothed with a box function , where the size of each box is chosen so that it contains 5 polarized background sources on average .",
    "this implies smoothing box of the size @xmath78  kpc for the _ evla _ _ 9h , high _ scenario and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82  kpc for the _ ska _ scenarios _ 1h , low _ , _ 1h , high _ , _ 100h , low _ , and _ 100h ,",
    "high _ , respectively .",
    "we list the properties of the rm maps in table  [ table ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_evla ] shows maps for the models a ( left panel ) and b ( right panel ) calculated for a 9h exposure with _",
    "evla _ in the scenario with an assumed high count of background polarized sources . the rm structure in both",
    "appears marginally resolved .",
    "the _ 9h , low _ scenario results in unresolved rm structure ( the rm map for this case is not shown but its properties are listed in table  [ table ] , for comparison ) .",
    "this is not surprising given the low number density of background sources within the considered area with average spacing between the sources of @xmath83  kpc , demarking the effective size of the `` resolution element '' in this scenario .",
    "figures  [ fig_hbi ] and [ fig_kolmog ] show the rm maps for models a and b , realized in each of the four observational scenarios with the _ ska_. in both , the instability - dominated and turbulence - dominated scenarios , the quality and spatial sampling of the maps increase with the density of background polarized sources , to the degree that the most optimistic observational scenario with the _ ska _ , _ 100h , high _ , almost exactly replicates the features of the continuous rm maps shown in figure  [ fig_mapsab ] .",
    "this is implied by the hierarchy of characteristic scales , @xmath84 , meaning that both the angular resolution of the _ ska _ and the density of the background polarized sources are sufficient to fully capture the spectrum of the @xmath85kpc scale rm variations in this model .    in all",
    "observational scenarios of model a it is possible to discern two distinct regions , which are characterized by the hbi ( core ) and mti ( outer region ) instabilities . the dark swirl patterns in the cooling core region , with low values of rm , arise where the magnetic field changes direction along the line of sight .",
    "because of the multiple magnetic field reversals along the lines of sight , the rm intensity ridges in the core do not correspond to the magnetic field structure in a trivial way .",
    "nevertheless , they carry an imprint of the azimuthal distribution of the field lines , and if indeed present in cooling core clusters , may be one of the characteristic features to search for in rm surveys of clusters . outside of the core ,",
    "where the magnetic field geometry is radial with decreasing magnitude , the rm intensity also decreases smoothly with radius . the diagonal feature apparent in maps calculated for model a , in the left panel of figure  [ fig_evla ] and",
    "all panels of figure  [ fig_hbi ] , is an artifact of our model : the underlying symmetry in the radial component of the magnetic field causes a cancellation in the rm along these lines of sight resulting in low values of rm .",
    "the black specs occur in places where the number of background sources per smoothing box falls to zero .",
    "the lower cutoff value applied in maps ( @xmath86 ) is comparable to the maximum error of rm reached at the limiting flux density @xmath87 with the _ evla _ and _ ska _ @xcite .    in model b , shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig_evla ] and",
    "figure  [ fig_kolmog ] , the rm patterns exhibit a noticeably different , patchy distribution .",
    "the local maxima ( minima ) of the rm distribution are again associated with regions where magnetic field reversal results in an enhancement ( a cancellation ) along the line of sight .",
    "the main difference in model b is that the cancellation effect is more pronounced relative to model a , due to the tangled geometry of the magnetic field , even though the assumed magnetic field strength is comparable in both models ( see   [ s_cluster_model ] ) .",
    "this results in the maximum rm value about an order of magnitude lower than in the model a , where the magnetic field lines exhibit uniformity and azimuthal structure on large scales .      an image analysis technique well suited to characterizing the different geometric patterns in the rm maps is _ polar shapelets _ @xcite .",
    "this is based on the unique decomposition of localized objects into a series of orthogonal basis functions that explicitly separate modes with different rotational symmetries .",
    "useful forms exist in both 2-d and 3-d .",
    "the former can generally be used for accurate object photometry and astrometry @xcite , as well as morphological classification of the images of galaxies @xcite , magnetograms of sunspots @xcite , and the response of the human visual cortex @xcite .",
    "its convenient mathematical properties and intuitive interpretation also make it a particularly effective morphology estimator for clusters magnetic fields .",
    "we fit each image @xmath88 in figures  [ fig_evla ] , [ fig_hbi ] and [ fig_kolmog ] as a weighted sum of shapelet basis functions @xmath89 such that @xmath90 where the ( complex ) coefficients @xmath91 describe the power in modes with @xmath92 radial oscillations and @xmath93-fold rotational symmetry , similar to a localized fourier transform .",
    "higher @xmath92-orders also capture structure at increasing distances from the cluster core . in general",
    ", the sum over @xmath92 can extend to infinity , although in practice we have arbitrarily truncated it to 30 .",
    "the sum over @xmath93 need include only every other term , because the intervening basis functions are explicitly zero .",
    "we focus our analysis on the inner 600  kpc region of the modeled cluster , which encloses the most interesting rm patterns , and show the magnitudes of the derived shapelet coefficients @xmath91 in figures  [ fig_evla_decomp ] , [ fig_hbi_decomp ] , [ fig_kolmog_decomp ] .",
    "the analysis of the maps for different observational scenarios within model a ( or model b ) give qualitatively similar results , but with varying ratios of signal to noise .",
    "the key idea is that the shapelet decomposition efficiently isolates modes of rotational symmetry present in the rm maps , even in the presence of significant observational noise .",
    "indeed , the distribution of power in the two models is strikingly different .",
    "the shapelet decomposition of scenarios in model a shows almost all power within the range @xmath94 , while it fans out uniformly over @xmath93 in turbulent model b. the radially symmetric ( @xmath95 ) modes describe the average , uniform level of the rm intensity .",
    "the restriction of model a s deviations from dipole ( @xmath96 ) , quadrupole ( @xmath97 ) and sextupole ( @xmath98 ) modes with low orders of rotational symmetry can be understood in light of the equivalent @xmath19 and @xmath20 terms in equations   and . for each model ,",
    "table  [ table ] lists the fraction of power in shapelet coefficients with @xmath99 to 3 , as estimators similar to the shapelet asymmetry estimator ( equation 61 of * ? ? ?",
    "in all the observational scenarios that we have considered , the magnetic field geometry of model a is distinguished from that of model b as a large fraction of rm power in modes @xmath100 and a decreasing power in higher-@xmath101 modes . in scenarios with a low density of background polarized sources , namely _ 9h , high _ ( left panel of figure  [ fig_evla_decomp ] ) and _ 1h , low _",
    "( top left panel of figure  [ fig_hbi_decomp ] ) , the observed rm measure map has insufficient resolution to contain all the @xmath98 modes , so the cutoff is present but less distinct . that the two _ evla _ and _ ska _ observational scenarios are indeed similar is indicated by the comparable polarized source densities and similar distributions of the rm intensity ( table  [ table ] ) .",
    "most excitingly , even in observing scenarios with noisier data , which may be achieved in longer exposures with _",
    "evla _ and relatively short exposures with _ ska _",
    ", the large - scale magnetic field patterns are efficiently captured by polar shapelets . in the remaining observational scenarios for the _ ska _ , characterized by the higher density of background polarized sources ( _ 1h , high _ , _ 100h , low _ and _ 100h , high _ ) , the distribution of power remains very robust , as illustrated by the polar shapelets decomposition .    in model b ,",
    "the power is more uniformly distributed among the azimuthal modes ( @xmath93-modes ) while the distribution across the radial modes ( @xmath92-modes ) changes with the number density of background polarized sources .",
    "in observational scenarios with the lower density of sources ( _ 9h , high _ , _ 1h , low _ and _ 100h , low _ ) , a significant fraction of the power is in lower @xmath92-modes and thus , the rm structure is captured on larger scales and not captured on small scales . with the increasing density of polarized sources some of the power shifts uniformly towards higher @xmath93 and @xmath92-modes ( see _ 1h , high _ scenario ) , indicating that finer rm structures are beginning to be resolved in this scenario .",
    "a practical implementation of the shapelet decomposition also requires advance estimates of a cluster s center and size , so that the basis functions can be constructed at a given location . for this analysis , we iteratively optimized the size of the basis functions to minimize residuals between the simulated rm map and its shapelet model",
    ". the scale factor of the basis functions represents the size of the gaussian used in image deconstruction . in combination with the maximum ( truncation ) value of @xmath92 in the model",
    ", it determines its resolution in such way that smaller values of the scale factor allow higher resolution models .",
    "the same scale size also sets the maximum spatial extent of the model , and there is a balance between the ability to model the large scale features and the high frequency detail , a choice that is optimized via @xmath102 minimization . the used sizes of the basis functions thus naturally arise to be different in the various observational scenarios and between models a and b , depending on the detail of the rm patterns .",
    "this approach allows to constrain the characteristic scale of the smallest ( resolved ) rm patterns using this iterative procedure , however , our results are robust to setting a fixed physical scale size to the reconstruction . also for the purposes of this analysis",
    ", we assumed that the center of a cluster would be known _",
    "a priori_. it would be possible to determine the best - fit center via iteration on the rm image itself , but it will likely be known to better accuracy in practice from independent ( e.g.  optical or x - ray ) observations .",
    "spurious offsets in the center primarily shift power in the dipole @xmath96 shapelet modes .",
    "indeed , small - scale structure near the cluster core in this realization , amplified by the high electron density , is responsible for the large @xmath103 and @xmath104 coefficients , which correspond to basis functions with a small spatial extent .",
    "if the center were determined from this data alone , this structure would pull the center around , shifting some power between adjacent shapelet coefficients @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the exact distribution of power in decomposed rm images is model - dependent and that neither of our two models should be regarded as a strict prediction of future observations .",
    "more generally , our analysis demonstrates that physical mechanisms that qualitatively adjust the magnetic field distribution in clusters can be easily distinguished using observed rm maps , with plausible exposure times .",
    "while the sensitivity of the instrument and ( consequently ) the density of observable polarized background sources strongly affect the precision of faraday rotation measure observations , the ability to tie the observed properties of the rm maps to the underlying magnetic field also depends on the effect of depolarization . depolarization is a reduction of the observed degree of polarization which may arise within the cluster itself due to its spatial extent ( internal depolarization ) or due to limitations in instrument capabilities ( beamwidth and bandwidth depolarization ) .",
    "we now disucss the importance of beamwidth and bandwidth depolarization in the context of our models .",
    "_ beamwidth depolarization _ arises when the minimum magnetic field coherence length is smaller than the beam size of the radio instrument , and cancellation of the rm occurs within the beam .",
    "given that the assumed beamwidth in our calculation is @xmath105pc and the magnetic field coherence lengths are much larger ( @xmath106  kpc ) , no beamwidth depolarization is expected to occur in these scenarios .",
    "a similar effect that can lead to a small loss of information is smoothing that we apply to all of our rm images . in our simulated observations , the smoothing length varies between @xmath107  kpc and @xmath108  kpc , depending upon the density of background sources in a particular observational scenario , and this determines the size of the smallest rm patterns that can be inferred with confidence from a smoothed image .",
    "however , this does not represent a fundamental limitation , since more sophisticated smoothing methods and scales could be adopted on real data .",
    "_ bandwidth depolarization _ is the cancellation and averaging of the faraday rotation measure that arises in polarimeters operating in fixed , wide frequency bands .",
    "bandwidth depolarization will be largely eliminated by the _ evla _ and _ ska _ , by acquiring rm measurements via the rotation measure synthesis method .",
    "rm - synthesis is based on multichannel spectro - polarimetry to enable the detection of weak , polarized emission @xcite .",
    "most importantly , this also allows the simultaneous observation of a range of different rm values , and the separation of rm components from distinct regions ( such as foreground and background structures ) along the line of sight .",
    "indeed , the rm signal due to faraday rotation of polarized light from real background sources is complicated by diffuse , intrinsic polarized emission from both the icm plasma itself , and our own galaxy .",
    "_ diffuse , polarized foreground emission _ from cooling core clusters can be attributed to mini - halos , steep spectrum radio sources associated with the icm around a powerful central radio galaxy .",
    "the prototypical example is a @xmath109  kpc mini - halo at the center of perseus .",
    "@xcite find that the diffuse emission observed at 350  mhz in the direction of perseus seems not to be related to the mini - halo but rather to the foreground emission from the milky way .",
    "our galaxy interferes with measurements by faraday - rotating any extragalactic polarized signal and by adding its own polarized emission .",
    "rm of galactic origin is typically @xmath110 but can be as high as @xmath111 for objects close to the galactic plane @xcite . in the direction of the perseus cluster for example ,",
    "@xcite measure a relatively low rm contribution ( compared to our modeled values ) in the range -50 to @xmath112 , which can in principle be disentangled from the rm map of the cluster using the rm - synthesis technique and is not expected to produce an rm signal competing with that from the cluster .",
    "thus , we conclude that the rm features modeled in this work are not expected to be significantly affected by depolarization and should dominate in magnitude over any component of rm contributed by the sources of diffuse polarized emission . the primary factor that determines the efficacy of the rm maps in probing",
    "the magnetic field structure is the sensitivity of the spectro - polarimetric measurements .",
    "even if mti and hbi instabilities operate uninhibited in real clusters , the radial - azimuthal field geometry is likely to be perturbed by intermittent phases of agn activity and mergers .",
    "as these perturbations are attenuated over time , they can source a new cycle of mhd instabilities .",
    "the relics of such events , including shocks , bubbles , and ridges of magnetic field lines swept by intracluster galaxies , may also be recognizable in high quality rm maps  testifying to the past evolution of a cluster . but with a characteristic time scale for the saturation of mhd instabilities of only a few billion years , the magnetic field lines can be driven to recover their orientation relatively quickly . as a consequence , a fraction of clusters may exhibit preferential magnetic field geometries , despite episodic disruptions .    circumstantial evidence in support of this hypothesis may already exist in several forms .",
    "recent detailed observations of the virgo cluster revealed an isothermal region with remarkable azimuthal symmetry cocooned in the cool core of the cluster between the active radio - lobes of m87 @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of the isothermal gas in the same region is non - uniform and clumpy .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the high metallicity parcels of gas were uplifted from the low entropy , cool core region of the cluster , where the density of stars is highest .",
    "that the parcels now have the entropy and temperature of the surrounding ambient plasma , but retain clumpy metallicity distribution , suggests that turbulent mixing was not efficient here and that the gas was instead heated by conduction .",
    "the presence and shape of the isothermal front indicate that the magnetic field geometry in this region may be _",
    "predominantly azimuthal_. furthermore , the absence of efficient turbulence indicates that hbi may operate unhindered in this region and that the instability may be more robust than suggested by some recent theoretical works @xcite .",
    "however , at least one more physical phenomenon may produce a similar magnetic field topology : @xcite find that weak turbulent motions lead to trapped @xmath2-modes and result in gas motions that are preferentially tangential .",
    "they suggest that magnetic fields in clusters experiencing such @xmath2-modes can in principle become tangential even in the absence of thermal conduction and the hbi .",
    "while some thermal conduction seems to be implied in the case of the virgo cluster , the concurrent presence of @xmath2-modes can not be eliminated .",
    "@xcite draw attention to what may be more circumstantial evidence for mhd instabilities .",
    "as much as @xmath113 of the sample of 70 clusters presented by @xcite have puzzling temperature profiles that appear to be quasi - isothermal at @xmath85mpc radii .",
    "the clusters show no signs of interaction , which could possibly have accounted for their temperature distribution , and they appear dynamically relaxed .",
    "moreover , it is unclear whether models based on theoretical studies of cluster properties could account for this unusual class of objects @xcite .",
    "if the class is shown to be unexpected , it may point to some missing physics in cosmological simulations .",
    "a possible explanation for the temperature structure of these objects is that thermal conduction operates very efficiently in their outer regions , an effect that arises as a natural consequence of the mti instability .",
    "radial configuration of magnetic field lines in outer regions of such clusters could only persist if they are isolated and unperturbed for sufficiently long periods of time , consistent with the observed properties of the quasi - isothermal clusters .",
    "another line of evidence comes from the study of magnetic field structure around galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "@xcite find that in virgo , which seems to be in transition to a cool core , the global magnetic field has a predominantly radial orientation at large radii , which again suggests the operation of mti in its icm .    in this study",
    ", we have evaluated the effects of two different physical mechanisms on the faraday rotation measure of a magnetized cooling core cluster , in the context of the planned capabilities of the _ evla _ and _ ska _ radio observatories .",
    "we compare a theoretical scenario in which conduction - driven mhd instabilities dominate the dynamics of the icm , to a scenario in which magnetic field topology is defined by turbulent motions .",
    "we employ the polar shapelets image analysis method to efficiently detect patterns in the rm image with specific rotational symmetries , and thus classify their morphologies . within the bounds of our simple models",
    "we find that the two mechanisms can produce strikingly different rm patterns and that future spectro - polarimetric measurements will have sufficient sensitivity to discriminate between them that can be achieved in longer exposures with _",
    "evla _ and relatively short exposures with _",
    "we propose that the effect of the hbi and mti instabilities be sought for in dynamically relaxed cooling core clusters , and especially in the subclass of clusters with quasi - isothermal temperature profiles at large radii .",
    "more generally , it should be possible to discern physical mechanisms that result in qualitatively different magnetic field topologies from observed faraday rotation measure maps , without a priori knowledge about the nature of the processes .",
    "such observations will enable detailed investigations into the behavior of mhd instabilities and other associated physical phenomena , which are of far reaching importance to a number of fundamental questions related to energy transport in clusters .",
