    "building scalable multi - qubit systems is presently the main challenge towards the implementation of a solid - state quantum information processor  @xcite .",
    "high - fidelity single qubit gates based both on semi-  @xcite and super - conducting technologies are nowadays available .",
    "in particular , for the three basic types of superconducting qubits ( charge , flux and phase ) single - qubit operations with high quality factor have been demonstrated in different laboratories  @xcite .",
    "further improvement has been recently achieved with circuit - qed architectures  @xcite .",
    "multi - qubit systems instead have been proved harder to operate , the main limitation arising from the broadband solid state noise .",
    "the requirements for building an elementary quantum processor are in fact quite demanding on the efficiency of the protocols .",
    "this includes both severe constraints on readout and a sufficient isolation from fluctuations to reduce decoherence effects .",
    "based on experiments on the different josephson junction ( jj ) setups , there is presently a general consensus on the most common noise spectral forms and on the main consequences on systems evolutions .",
    "typically noise is broadband and structured , i. e. the noise spectrum extends to several decades , it is non - monotonic , sometimes a few resonances are present .",
    "noise with @xmath0 spectrum is common to virtually all nanodevices .",
    "its physical origin varies from device to device and depends on the specific material .",
    "different implementations are in fact more sensitive either to charge , flux or to critical current fluctuations with spectral density scaling as the inverse of the frequency .",
    "the presence of slow components in the environment makes the decay of the coherent signal strongly dependent on the experimental protocol being used  @xcite .",
    "measurements protocols requiring numerous repetitions are particularly sensitive to the unstable device calibration due to low - frequency fluctuations .",
    "the leading effect is defocusing of the measured signal , analogous to inhomogeneous broadening in nmr  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic high - frequency cut - off of @xmath0 noise is hardly detectable , measurements typically extending to @xmath1  hz ( recently charge noise up to @xmath2  mhz has been detected in a set  @xcite ) .",
    "incoherent energy exchanges between system and environment , leading to relaxation and decoherence , occur at typical operating frequencies ( about @xmath2 ghz ) .",
    "indirect measurements of noise spectrum in this frequency range often suggest a white or ohmic behavior  @xcite .",
    "in addition , narrow resonances at selected frequencies ( sometimes resonant with the nanodevice relevant energy scales ) have being observed  @xcite . in certain devices",
    "they originate from the circuitry  @xcite and may eventually be reduced by circuit design .",
    "more often , resonances are signatures of the presence of spurious fluctuators which also show up in the time resolved evolution , unambiguously proving the discrete nature of the noise sources  @xcite .",
    "such fluctuators may severely limit the reliability of nanodevices  @xcite .",
    "explanation of this rich physics is beyond phenomenological theories describing the environment as a set of harmonic oscillators . on the other side , an accurate characterization of the noise sources",
    "might be a priory inefficient , since a huge number of parameters would be required for a microscopic description .",
    "therefore one may follow a different route , consisting in classifying noise sources on the basis of their effects instead of on their nature and to understand , case by case , which is the efficient description of the environment .",
    "the required information may in fact depend on the specific protocol , especially when the environment is long - time correlated .",
    "this program is meaningful for quantum information where relevant time scales are much smaller than the decoherence time .",
    "this means that in the generic favorable situation coupling with the environment has simple effects on the system dynamics . as a difference with condensed matter physics where",
    "long time behavior is emphasized and interesting problems involve entanglement of a many - body system .",
    "here we illustrate a road - map to treat broadband noise which allows to obtain reasonable approximations by systematically including only the relevant information on the environment , out of the huge parametrization needed to specify it .",
    "the multi - stage approach for the different classes of broadband noise has been originally introduced for single qubit gates  @xcite .",
    "the obtained predictions for the decay of the coherent signal are in agreement with observations in various jj implementations and in different protocols  @xcite .",
    "we mention the observed decay of ramsey fringes in charge - phase qubits  @xcite and recent results on flux / phase qubits  @xcite . here",
    "we extend the procedure to complex solid - state architectures . as an illustrative case",
    ", we perform a systematic analysis of the effects and interplay of low and high frequency noise components in a two - qubit gate in a fixed coupling scheme .",
    "such a systematic analysis points out that efficient operations in the solid state require an accurate preliminary characterization of the noise spectral characteristics and tuning appropriately the device working point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the general framework of solid - state multi qubit gates and illustrate the characteristics of the most common spectral forms . in section 3",
    "we propose a classification of the noise sources and in section 4 we present a multi - stage approach to deal with broadband noise .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to adiabatic noise . in section 6 the multistage approach",
    "is applied to a universal two - qubit gate .",
    "section 7 summarizes our main findings .",
    "a multi - qubit gate can be modeled by the following hamiltonian ( @xmath3 ) @xmath4 where for each qubit , labeled by @xmath5 , @xmath6 includes set of parameters intrinsic to the device and time dependent classical control fields .",
    "manipulation of tunable fields allows control of the dynamics and design of arbitrary single qubit operations via unitary transformations .",
    "interactions among qubits and the needed additional parametrization to describe the multi - qubit gate are included in @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the design , the control hamiltonian may span a reduced subspace of the qubit liouville space .",
    "in other words , there is a limited number of ports available for control , for tuning , for state preparation and measurement .",
    "noise is also coupled via these ports .",
    "it is rather usual that only one of the control fields allows the required fast addressing of each qubit .",
    "therefore we focus on a model where both the control fields , @xmath8 , and the environment are coupled to a single qubit operator , say @xmath9 , @xmath10 where the polar angles @xmath11 define qubit-@xmath12 working point .",
    "the environment hamiltonian is @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a collective environment variable acting on qubit @xmath12 .",
    "model ( [ h ] ) implies a projection of the device hamiltonian onto the subspace spanned by the two lowest energy eigenstates for each qubit .",
    "this description is valid provided that manipulations with the control fields do not induce leakage to higher energy states of the device  @xcite .",
    "we leave unspecified the nature of the noise sources described by @xmath15 , relevant cases being either discrete or gaussian fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the environment hamiltonian may include correlations among noise sources affecting each qubit . in the spirit of the present analysis",
    ", we assume that the only information at our disposal is the power spectrum of @xmath16 fluctuations @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the equilibrium average with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "we remark that the effect of the environment on the system dynamics is completely characterized by @xmath19 only if the environment is composed of harmonic oscillators or if it is weakly coupled to the system and short time correlated .",
    "of course this is not the case if low - energy excitations determine memory effects .",
    "this is the typical situation in the solid state where in general additional statistical information on the environment is required .",
    "we assume that each noise component @xmath16 has broadband spectrum @xmath20 , @xmath21 followed by a white or ohmic flank at frequencies @xmath22 .",
    "low- and high - frequency cutoffs depend on the specific setup",
    ". impurities of various origin responsible for random telegraph fluctuations contribute lorentzian peaks to the power spectrum @xmath23 .",
    "such a spectrum originates from classical fluctuations @xmath24 , where @xmath25 randomly switches between two values @xmath26 with rate @xmath27 .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath28 bistable impurities with a distribution of switching rates @xmath29 , @xmath30 $ ] and average coupling strength @xmath31 , gives rise to @xmath0-spectrum , @xmath32\\,\\,\\omega^{-1}$ ]  @xcite",
    ". selected lorentzian peaks may be visible in the spectrum if individual impurities are strongly coupled , i. e. when @xmath33 . instead , damped coherent fluctuators at frequencies @xmath34 , in the simplest cases contribute to the total spectrum with additional peaks , @xmath35 .",
    "spectroscopic evidence of coherent impurities of frequency @xmath36 close to the qubit larmor frequency has been reported in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the possibility to exploit spurious quantum two - level systems as qubits  @xcite or for quantum memory operations has been recently demonstrated  @xcite . in these cases a quantum description of the impurity",
    "is required  @xcite .",
    "the above description illuminates that in the solid state we have to deal with broadband and structured noise . in other words",
    ", the noise spectrum extends to several decades , it is non - monotonic , sometimes a few resonances are present .",
    "the various noise sources responsible for the above phenomenology have a qualitative different influence on the system evolution .",
    "this naturally leads to a classification of the noise sources according to the effects produced rather than to their specific nature .",
    "the effects of high - amplitude noise at low frequencies , like @xmath0 noise , vary from protocol to protocol .",
    "this feature is typical of non - markovian baths .",
    "quantum operations necessarily require repetitions of single detections , each leading to boolean answer",
    ". therefore , even `` single shot '' measurements result from numerous repetitions of single runs in an overall process which may last minutes . in the presence of low frequency fluctuations",
    "this leads to unstable device calibration and random clock frequencies in the various repetitions . as a result ,",
    "a de - focused signal is observed , a phenomenon analogous to inhomogeneous broadening in nmr .",
    "re - focusing protocols , like echo or some dynamical decoupling schemes , allow partial recovery of the signal  @xcite .",
    "since the environment is long - time correlated , statistical information beyond the power spectrum may be required to describe its effects .",
    "this is the case for instance in echo protocols  @xcite .",
    "environments with long - time memory belong to the class of adiabatic noise , for which the born - oppenheimer approximation is applicable .",
    "we classify this part of the noise spectrum as `` adiabatic noise '' .",
    "noise at higher frequency , around the system typical scales ( e.g. single qubit larmor frequencies ) , results in incoherent energy exchanges between the quantum device and the environment . in particular , high - frequency noise is responsible for spontaneous decay . for systems relevant for quantum information ,",
    "the system - bath coupling is rather small , in addition high - frequency noise is short - time correlated .",
    "therefore , in simplest cases , effects can be described by a born - markov master equation  @xcite .",
    "for single qubit gates it leads to the relaxation and secular dephasing times , @xmath37 and @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "we classify this part of the noise spectrum as `` quantum noise '' .",
    "finally , resonances in the spectrum unveil the presence of discrete noise sources which severely effect the system performances , in particular reliability of devices .",
    "this is the case when classical impurities are slow enough to induce a visible bistable instability in the system intrinsic frequency .",
    "for instance , single qubit gates in the presence of random telegraph noise ( switching rate @xmath27 ) may display two effective frequencies , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , depending on the impurity state .",
    "their visibility is measured by the ratio @xmath41 .",
    "beatings can be observed in the `` strong coupling '' regime @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "quantum impurities may also entangle with the device .",
    "this additionally leads to a variety of features , like peculiar temperature dependencies of decay rates  @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "knowledge of the power spectrum is absolutely insufficient and in order to describe these effects the relevant system hilbert space has to be enlarged to include the responsible environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "effects in general depend on the specific protocol and require a microscopic model of the fluctuators .",
    "we classify this part of the noise spectrum as `` strongly - coupled noise '' .",
    "each noise class requires a specific approximation scheme , which is not appropriate for the other classes .",
    "the overall effect results from the interplay of the three classes of noise . in the following section we will illustrate a multi - scale theory to deal with solid state broadband noise .",
    "we are interested to a reduced description of the @xmath43-qubit system , expressed by the reduced density matrix @xmath44 .",
    "it is formally obtained by tracing out environmental degrees of freedom from the total density matrix @xmath45 , which depends on quantum ( q ) , adiabatic ( a ) and strongly coupled ( sc ) variables .",
    "the elimination procedure can be conveniently performed by separating in the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath46 , various noise classes , e.g. by formally writing @xmath47 adiabatic noise is typically correlated on a time scale much longer than the inverse of the natural frequencies @xmath48 , then application of the born - oppenheimer approximation is equivalent to replace @xmath49 with a classical stochastic field @xmath50 .",
    "this approach is valid when the contribution of adiabatic noise to spontaneous decay is negligible , a necessary condition being @xmath51 .",
    "this condition is usually satisfied at short enough times , since @xmath52 is substantially different from zero only at frequencies @xmath53 .",
    "this fact already suggests a route to trace - out different noise classes in the appropriate order .",
    "the total density matrix parametrically depends on the specific realization of the slow random drives @xmath54 and may be written as @xmath55 .",
    "the first step is to trace out quantum noise . in the simplest cases this requires solving a master equation . in a second stage",
    ", the average over all the realizations of the stochastic processes , @xmath56 , is performed .",
    "this leads to a reduced density matrix for the @xmath43-qubit system plus the strongly coupled degrees of freedom .",
    "these have to be traced out in a final stage by solving the heisenberg equations of motion , or by approaches suitable to the specific microscopic hamiltonian or interaction .",
    "for instance , the dynamics may be solved exactly for some special quantum impurity models at pure dephasing , @xmath57 , when impurities are longitudinally coupled to each qubit  @xcite .",
    "the ordered multi - stage elimination procedure can be formally written as @xmath58 \\ ,",
    "p[\\vec x(t ) ] \\ ;   tr_{q } \\big [ \\ , w^{q , sc}\\big(t | \\vec x(t)\\big ) \\ , \\big]\\right\\ } \\ , .\\ ] ] in the following section we concentrate on the elimination of adiabatic noise",
    ". the ordered procedure will be illustrated in section 6 for a two - qubit gate .",
    "in general , the adiabatic approximation holds true for times short enough to fulfill the necessary condition , @xmath59 . in the peculiar , pure dephasing regime , @xmath57 ,",
    "relaxation processes are forbidden and the adiabatic approximation is exact for any @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , the adiabatic scheme can be applied also in the presence of correlations between processes @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xcite . for the sake of clarity here",
    "we consider adiabatic noise affecting independently each qubit .",
    "moreover , we exclude time - dependent drives in @xmath8 and in @xmath63 . the procedure can be straightforwardly extended for instance to rabi oscillations and other ac - drives  @xcite .",
    "suppose we are able to diagonalize , for each realization @xmath56 of the stochastic processes , the system hamiltonian , @xmath64 and denote @xmath65 an instantaneous eigenstate of ( [ eq : hamiltonian - stochastic ] ) with eigenvalue @xmath66 .",
    "if the system is prepared in a pure state , @xmath67 , in the adiabatic approximation , each component @xmath68 evolves in time according to @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dynamic phase .",
    "the stray fields @xmath56 affect the time evolution of the gate fidelity via modifications of the phases @xmath71 and of the eigenstates @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , @xmath73 reflects imperfect preparation due to the random field .",
    "this occurs , for instance , when the system is prepared by a reset to a pure state vector @xmath67 followed by an initialization pulse whose effect depends also on the stray field at @xmath74 .",
    "the evolution of the system conditional density matrix can be presented in a compact form @xmath75 \\ ; { \\mathrm e}^{- i \\int_0^t d s \\ , \\omega_{m p}(s ) }   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the instantaneous splittings appearing in the phase factor are @xmath76 and we have introduced the operator @xmath77 = \\ , { \\,| \\ , { m(\\vec x_t ) } \\,\\rangle   \\,}{\\ , \\langle\\,{m(\\vec x_0 ) } \\,|\\ , }   \\rho(0 ) { \\,| \\ , { p(\\vec x_0 ) } \\,\\rangle   \\ , } { \\ , \\langle\\,{p(\\vec x_t ) } \\,|\\,}\\ ] ] which contains information about the preparation and the eigenstates errors . finally , the average of @xmath78 over the stochastic process yields the system density matrix , which can be presented as a path integral @xmath79 \\ ,",

    "the filter function @xmath84 $ ] describes the specific operation . for most of present day experiments on solid - state qubits",
    "@xmath84=1 $ ] . for an open - loop feedback protocol , which allows initial control of some collective variable of the environment ,",
    "say @xmath85 , we should put @xmath84 \\propto \\ , \\delta(\\vec x_0 ) = \\ , \\pi_i \\delta(x_{i0})$ ] .",
    "a critical issue is the identification of @xmath82 $ ] for the specific noise sources , as those displaying @xmath0 power spectrum .",
    "if we sample the stochastic process at times @xmath86 , with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we can identify @xmath89 = \\lim_{m \\to \\infty }   p_{m+1}(\\vec x_m , t;\\dots ; \\vec x_1 , t_1 ; \\vec x_0 , 0 )   \\ , ,   \\label{sampling}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is a @xmath91 joint probability and we have used the shorthand notation @xmath92 . in the following we will propose a systematic method to select only the relevant statistical information on the stochastic process out of the full characterization included in @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "we would like to remark , at this point , that in the adiabatic treatment the word decoherence is perhaps abused .",
    "decoherence is ultimately due to entanglement of the qubit to a quantum environment  @xcite , whereas classical adiabatic noise produces only de - focusing . however , unless the signal can be _ totally _ re - focused , and this is impossible in practice , the behavior of @xmath93 is the same as for true decoherence  @xcite . in other words , although proper and improper mixed states at the fundamental level are well distinct concepts  @xcite , they are not distinct in the density matrix description .",
    "we also observe that present day `` applied '' research on solid - state coherent nanodevices for quantum information focuses on the `` short - time '' dynamics , since a signal which is almost decayed is useless . in this context , methods as the adiabatic approximation are valuable even if they are not accurate at long time scales and are not valid down to zero temperature .",
    "the longitudinal approximation consists in neglecting modifications of the eigenstates @xmath72 and preparation effects . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume vanishing average of the stochastic processes after the preparation pulse , @xmath94 .",
    "the longitudinal approximation amounts to put @xmath95 where @xmath96 is an eigenstate of the system hamiltonian @xmath97 .",

    "this would be the only effect if the noise would act longitudinally , @xmath102 .",
    "variations of the eigenstates @xmath103 originate instead from `` transverse '' variations of @xmath101 .",
    "the longitudinal assumption has been performed in ref.@xcite to discuss the effect of gaussian adiabatic environments .",
    "the present approach automatically provides constraints on its validity and shows that whereas errors due to transverse fluctuations are weakly dependent on time , phase errors accumulate .",
    "therefore , transverse noise in the adiabatic approximation has possibly some effect only at very short times , but the phase damping channel eventually prevails .",
    "these considerations strongly depend on the amplitude of the noise .",
