    "time travel is a phenomenon which has been attracting interest both in fiction and general discussions for a long time .",
    "however , only after a formulation of the theory of relativity such considerations could be investigated on a more scientific and solid basis .",
    "already the special relativity shows that different observers experience different times and one of them can `` travel '' to the future of others by means of his relative motion .",
    "thanks to the general theory of relativity a possibility opens that an observer could travel even to his own past  his worldline could pass through a geometrically or topologically nontrivial area to a region where the worldline originally started @xcite .",
    "worldlines which even cross themselves are called _ closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) _ and it is customary to say that spacetimes with ctcs contain _ time machines _ @xcite .",
    "spacetimes with time machines are causally nontrivial  in such spacetimes you can send a signal to your own past or even try to influence the past  which immediately opens a question of consistency of standard physical laws as we know them . on a formal level it is the question of the existence of solutions of physical equations of motion and the question whether the initial value problem is well possessed . on a less formal level",
    "these problems can be phrased as the well - known `` grandfather paradox '' , suggested , e.g. , in @xcite : in spacetimes with time machines one has to face a logical riddle what happens if one travels to his own past and kills his grandfather .",
    "consequently one would never be born and therefore one could not travel to the past .",
    "this is a clearly inconsistent situation which suggests that spacetimes with ctcs are pathological and they should be excluded from a serious scientific consideration .",
    "however , a system containing live beings is too complicated by too many unknown physical laws and therefore one can not be sure that the inconsistency of the `` grandfather paradox '' is really inescapable .",
    "therefore , people tried to formulate analogous situations for much simpler systems which could be studied exactly @xcite .",
    "as an example , in @xcite , and especially in @xcite , the system of the billiard balls in spacetime with wormholes has been studied .",
    "this system allows a straightforward reformulation of the grandfather paradox : the ball could be sent through the time machine in such a way that it hits itself and thus prevents inconsistently its entry to the time machine , cf .",
    "[ fig : dangerous - px ] .",
    "it seems that such `` paradoxical '' initial conditions do not lead to a consistent evolution of the system .",
    "* the ball self - colliding inconsistently . *",
    "the ball ( in gray ) comes from a distant region and enters the wormhole without any self - collision .",
    "it leaves the time machine ( now in white ) in such a way that it inconsistently hits itself .",
    "thus , this situation represents an inconsistent evolution which is the direct analogue of the grandfather paradox.,width=316 ]    maybe surprisingly , the extensive studies of systems with ctcs during the 1980s and the 1990s showed , that for a simple physical system pathology of spacetimes is not so severe and the equations of motion can be consistently solved .",
    "let us formulate this point more precisely .",
    "we consider a spacetime containing a time machine and we want to study a system with well known local physical laws ( e.g. , a particle or electromagnetic field ) . we do not change these local laws , i.e.",
    ", we require that they hold locally in any small spacetime domain .",
    "however , in addition to the local laws , we also require the so - called _ principle of self - consistency _ @xcite .",
    "namely , a _ globally consistent _ solution of local laws must exist .",
    "it means that we allow the system to propagate to its own past , however , it must be done in a _ consistent _ way with the original evolution in the past .",
    "the past can not be changed since it has been already changed .",
    "the key question of studies of time machines is whether such globally consistent evolutions exist for given local laws and whether these global evolutions are sufficiently generic .",
    "more accurately , we would like to show that there exist consistent solutions for all , or , at least , for almost all standard initial data .",
    "otherwise , if the local laws have no globally consistent solution , the spacetime would be clearly pathological and we could rule it out from our consideration .",
    "similarly , the pathology would be serious if the local physical laws had only few globally consistent solutions .",
    "as we have said , the studies of different systems show that spacetimes with ctcs are not necessarily causally pathological .",
    "let us mention the results for a system of interacting particles @xcite or the scalar field theory @xcite where it was shown that standard local laws have generic globally consistent solutions even in the presence of ctcs .",
    "another surprising result of such studies is that the existence of time machines does not usually restrict a number of consistent solutions , but on the contrary , it leads to a possibility of more than one globally consistent solutions for given initial values . in spacetimes with time machines",
    "we thus usually lose the uniqueness of the evolution @xcite .",
    "especially for the apparently paradoxical initial conditions from the `` grandfather paradox''-like situation it was shown @xcite that a consistent evolution exists , although it can be rather nonintuitive . on less formal level of the human version of the paradox it could be rephrased as a conjecture of a hidden law which always prevents the grandson from killing his grandfather @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we want to study the system of a ball moving in a non - relativistic space with ctcs which is very close to that of @xcite",
    ". however , we have chosen a different time - machine configuration which significantly simplifies the analysis .",
    "we will be able to solve the equations of motion explicitly and we will confirm the behavior described above : `` paradoxical '' initial conditions are not really paradoxical , and the evolution is not , in general , unique .",
    "the contribution of our analysis is that it can be done very explicitly , since our model is sufficiently simple ; at the same time it is sufficiently non - trivial to reproduce the most important features of systems with time machines .",
    "our work proceeds as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the system of a ball moving in the space with wormhole - based time machine .",
    "we derive the equations characterizing trajectories . in sec .",

    "planar wormhole mouths could be obtained , e.g. , by squeezing the mouths of the spherical wormhole into very thin planes ) .",
    "the external curvature is vanishing with the exception of the boundary of the planar sections and the geometry through the wormhole is thus flat.,width=316 ]    the simplest and most natural way how to construct a spacetime with ctcs is to use a wormhole @xcite .",
    "the wormhole can be viewed as a shortcut between two location of the spacetime .",
    "it forms ctcs if one of the mouths of the wormhole lies in the past of the other mouth . in the nonrelativistic",
    "setting we can consider spatial wormholes connecting two places in space with an additional time - shift .",
    "the speed of light is infinite and it determines a unique notion of simultaneity and thus it allows us to define a global time  at least , before introducing the time difference . introducing the time - shift means that traveling through the wormhole not only sends the observer to a different place in space but also to a different time .    a simple spatial wormhole in otherwise euclidian space can be obtained by the cutting and gluing method . for example",
    ", we can cut out two spheres and glue their surfaces together , cf .",
    "@xcite , or @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain a topologically and geometrically nontrivial space ",
    "it is not a simply connected space and the geometry on the glued surface is not flat .    in this work",
    "we consider even a simpler situation of the wormhole with planar mouths instead of spherical ones .",
    "namely , we cut out from the space two planar sections which we identify as in fig .",
    "[ fig : wh - s ] .",
    "since we use flat planar sections , their identification is geometrically trivial .",
    "the whole curvature of the mouths is squeezed to the borders of the planar sections which can be understood as a kind of solid frames on which the traversable parts of the wormhole are spanned . to avoid a discussion of the wormhole boundary",
    "we assume that the planar sections are much larger than the scales of our experiments .",
    "as idealization , we consider the mouths of our wormhole to be two half - planes which form an angle @xmath0 with a common boundary line , called the axis .",
    "if we identify these half - planes ( first , say , at the same moment of time ) , the space between them becomes a locally euclidean space with a conical singularity localized on the axis .",
    "indeed , if we restrict ourselves to the two dimensional picture and ignore the direction parallel to the axis , our space forms a cone with the angle @xmath0 around the vertex .    of course",
    ", this is a over - idealized situation",
    ". we should keep in mind that the mouths of the wormhole are large but finite , so somewhere very far from the axis the conical part of the space ends and goes over to the full euclidean space .",
    "but in most of our discussions we restrict ourselves only to the part of the space between the mouths of the wormhole .",
    "we thus effectively work in the conical space with angle @xmath0 around the axis .",
    "let us stress that in our construction the mouths of the wormhole are special and privileged .",
    "however , after enlarging them to the semi - infinite size and restricting ourselves only to the conical space between mouths , we can no longer localize the position of the mouths by local experiments .",
    "the geometry through the mouths is locally euclidean as anywhere else .",
    "we thus obtained a space which is axially symmetric with respect to the rotation around the axis ( it has also translation symmetry along the axis and it is static ) .",
    "the position of the wormhole can be identified only on scales larger than the wormhole , from the surrounding globally euclidean space .",
    "finally , we assume that the angle @xmath1 . only for @xmath0 smaller than @xmath2 ,",
    "we obtain interesting situations when the straight trajectory of a free particle intersects itself .",
    "for @xmath3 the straight trajectory intersects itself only once .",
    "the second condition is not a crucial assumption , it just simplifies the discussion .",
    "since we want to study a space with a time machine , we have to identify the mouths of the wormhole with a time - shift @xmath4 .",
    "of course , it destroys the standard causal structure of the non - relativistic spacetime ( a clear distinction between future and past ) . despite this",
    ", we will keep using and referring to the original notion of the simultaneity and to the global time of the surrounding space , which is , certainly , reasonable for small wormholes , but we admit , it can be slightly confusing and less founded in the idealized case considered below .    indeed , the constructed spacetime is still locally euclidian ( of course , except the axis ) , but endowed with a strange causal structure .",
    "hypersurfaces of simultaneity ( visualized in the standard non - relativistic spacetime diagram as horizontal planes ) propagate through the wormhole and form `` helical '' surfaces winding around the axis .",
    "this indicates that the spacetime contains ctcs .",
    "the particle moving towards the wormhole reads that the external time @xmath5 increases continuously until it enters the wormhole mouth . by crossing one of the mouths the external time @xmath5 either increases by @xmath6 into @xmath7 , or decreases by @xmath8 into @xmath9 .    * a spacetime diagram of the conical time machine . *",
    "the vertical direction is temporal , horizontal planes correspond to the hypersurface of simultaneity of the original spacetime ( the third spatial direction is suppressed ) . two half - planes on the boundary of the conical spacetime represent the history of the mouths of the wormhole and they are identified with a time - shift @xmath4.,width=316 ]    this can be visualized in the spacetime diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : wh - st ] . here , two spatial directions perpendicular to the axis are shown in horizontal directions , the direction parallel to axis is suppressed .",
    "the vertical direction corresponds to time .",
    "semi - planar mouths of the wormhole at one moment are thus depicted as horizontal semi - lines , their time evolution as vertical half - planes .",
    "the identification of such two half - planes is not on the same vertical level , but with the vertical shift @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that going through the wormhole in anticlockwise direction takes us time @xmath10 to the past , in clockwise direction to the future .",
    "now , we want to derive equations of motion for a ball moving in the non - relativistic spacetime which has just been described .",
    "we assume that the motion satisfies classical local laws of motion . additionally , we restrict ourselves to motions perpendicular to the axis of the wormhole because the ball can self - interact only for such a motion",

    "the conical space breaks the uniqueness of the classical solutions even without the time machine . indeed , for given initial and final points , in the conical space there exist more trajectories which join them .",
    "this effect is purely geometrical and does not need a nontrivial causal structure .",
    "however , we have identified a different kind of uniqueness : we have found that the specification of both the initial position and the momentum ( the complete initial conditions ) admits more different evolutions , which is certainly surprising when the local evolution is given by standard differential equations which are generally accepted as deterministic .",
    "non - uniqueness appears here as a strange result of the interplay between a local deterministic evolution and a nontrivial causal structure on a global scale for which the time machine is the key ingredient .",
    "let us finally mention , that further study @xcite of our system revealed , that if one takes into account a possibility of multiple self - collisions , the situation gets even more interesting .",
    "in this work we have studied only the collision - free trajectories , and the trajectories with one self - collision .",
    "however , the incoming and outgoing trajectories from the self - collision can easily self - intersect and for a special choice of parameters even self - collide again .",
