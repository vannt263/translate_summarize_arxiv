    "the kinematic dynamo effect is generally believed to be facilitated by a separation of spatial scales between the flow and the magnetic field .",
    "this idea has its roots in the discovery of the @xmath5-effect ( steenbeck , 1966 ; krause and rdler , 1980 ) for non - parity - invariant flows ( an instance of which are helical flows ) .",
    "indeed , recent results indicate that helicity and scale separation can lead to experimental dynamos ( gailitis , 2000 ; busse , 2000 , stieglitz and mller , 2001 ) .",
    "lanotte  ( 1999 ) showed that scale separation can also be useful for flows possessing parity invariance and thus lacking @xmath5-effect .",
    "they found a first instance of a three - dimensional parity - invariant flow , the `` modified taylor  green flow '' , which can amplify a large - scale magnetic field by a negative eddy diffusivity mechanism , as conjectured by kraichnan ( 1976 ) .",
    "examples of negative eddy diffusivities when the magnetic field depends on all three coordinates , while the flow depends only on two ( two and a half dimensional dynamos ) were actually known since the work of roberts ( 1972 ) .",
    "new instances of large - scale dynamos with the roberts flow were found more recently by tilgner ( 1997 ) and plunian and rdler ( 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "emergence of the @xmath5-effect and the negative eddy diffusivity effect can be demonstrated by asymptotic theory involving , in principle , very large scale separation .",
    "both the aforementioned experiments and numerical simulations with helical ( galanti , 1992 ) flows indicate that even a moderate scale separation of a factor two can help for obtaining a dynamo ( a physical interpretation for the case of the abc flows has been proposed by archontis ( 2000 ) ) .    the following argument due to fauve ( 1999 ) shows , how crucial for experimental dynamos it is to lower the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath6 . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the overall scale of the apparatus , @xmath8 is the typical velocity and @xmath9 is the ( molecular ) magnetic diffusivity . given the typically very small value of the magnetic prandtl number , the flow is expected to be strongly turbulent .",
    "hence , the kinetic energy dissipated per unit time in the apparatus is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the fluid density and @xmath12 is the typical spatial scale of the velocity .",
    "thus , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the scale - separation factor . therefore , for a given fluid ( @xmath9 ) , geometry ( @xmath15 ) and size ( @xmath7 ) , the required pump power behaves as the cube of the attainable @xmath16 .",
    "it is generally believed that the cost of an experiment scales roughly as its volume , i.e. @xmath17 ; thus , if there are practical limitations on the maximum pump power available , the cost will scale as the ninth power of the attainable @xmath16 .",
    "all this makes it desirable to design apparatus with the lowest possible critical magnetic reynolds number .",
    "our intention is to begin a systematic investigation of the kinematic dynamo effect for parity - invariant flows with large or moderate scale separation with emphasis on ( i ) the genericity of the phenomenon of negative eddy diffusivity and ( ii ) the lowering of the critical magnetic reynolds number .",
    "note , that parity - invariant flows are at least as `` natural '' as helical ones .",
    "indeed , the navier - stokes equations are parity - invariant .",
    "hence , even if this particular symmetry , like most other symmetries , is broken by the mechanisms generating the flow , we can expect the symmetry to be dynamically restored in a statistical sense at high reynolds numbers ( frisch , 1995 ) .",
    "note also that the existence of three - dimesnional flow with negative eddy diffusivity is a recent discovery ; contrary to the alpha effect which can be derived in purely analytic fashion by working , e.g. , at low magnetic reynolds numbers or with a delta - correlated ( in time ) velocity , only ( very cpu - demanding ) numerical solutions of the equations arising from multi - scale techniques can demonstrate the existence of negative eddy - diffusivities and can show that it is not a pathologically unusual effect .",
    "we shall work here with time - independent flows , which we may think of as being averages of turbulent flows .",
    "we are of course aware that time dependence of the flow and , generally more realistic choices of the basic flow could somewhat modify our conclusions ; such issues are left for future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sections",
    "[ s : expansion ] and [ s : abundance ] we consider the case where the spatial scale of magnetic field is much larger than that of the flow .",
    "then @xmath15 is a natural small parameter , enabling one to apply asymptotic methods .",
    "multiscale expansions in hydrodynamics may be viewed as adaptations of general homogenization methods used to determine effective large - scale transport coefficients of periodic or random materials ( bensoussan , 1978 ; kozlov , 1978 ; zhikov , 1979 ) .",
    "usually the effective coefficients can not be obtained without solving suitable auxiliary small - scale problems . in three space dimensions",
    "this may require significant computational resources . in lanotte  ( 1999 ) equations for the large - scale component of magnetic fields",
    "are derived along the same lines as in previous works on negative eddy viscosity in ordinary incompressible hydrodynamics ( dubrulle and frisch , 1991 ; gama , 1994 ; wirth , 1995 ) .",
    "here we use a similar but a distinct approach based on the work of vishik ( 1986 , 1987 ) , which yields a complete decomposition of magnetic modes and their eigenvalues ( in arbitrarily high - order terms of such expansions are derived ) .    to investigate ,",
    "how commonly the phenomenon of negative magnetic eddy diffusivity is exhibited by fully three - dimensional flows , we follow in a strategy similar to the one , which gama  ( 1994 ) applied to estimate the abundance of two - dimensional flows with negative eddy viscosity . by solving numerically the relevant auxiliary problems we determine the minimum over directions of the ( anisotropic ) magnetic eddy diffusivities for two ensembles of flows with random fourier components",
    "this way we determine the fraction of flows such that , when decreasing molecular magnetic diffusivity , a large - scale negative eddy diffusivity instability appears before the flow becomes a small - scale dynamo .",
    "an interpretation of `` outliers '' with strongly negative eddy diffusivity , found in computations , is given in .",
    "since it is important for our purpose to analyze as many instances as possible , we have used a new efficient algorithm for solving the elliptic auxiliary problems arising from the two - scale expansion .",
    "this method is an outgrowth of the chebyshev iterative method developed by podvigina and zheligovsky ( 1997 ) for self - adjoint negative definite linear operators .",
    "the operators arising in hydrodynamical problems are not self - adjoint , but they naturally split into a dominant self - adjoint negative definite part ( the molecular diffusion term ) and the remaining transport term .",
    "we can then combine chebyshev methods with operator splitting to reduce the harm stemming from complex eigenvalues .",
    "this method and its theoretical foundations are presented in detail in zheligovsky ( 2001 ) , available only in russian . for the reader",
    "s convenience , the essentials are given in .",
    "in we turn to cases with moderate scale separation ( i.e. when @xmath15 is finite ) .",
    "first , we consider instances of flows for which we already know that there is a negative magnetic eddy diffusivity , and we determine windows in @xmath15 over which dynamo action is present .",
    "second , we examine the case @xmath18 , that is , we assume that the magnetic field has a spatial period twice that of the flow , and study how the critical magnetic reynolds number @xmath16 is affected , compared to the case with no scale separation ( @xmath19 ) . in both types of computations we exploit the fact that , for space - periodic boundary conditions , eigenmodes have the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a prescribed wavevector .",
    "this enables one to solve a problem involving only small scales , but parameterized by @xmath15 and @xmath21 ( cf .",
    "roberts , 1972 ; frisch , 1986 ) .",
    "solution of the eigenvalue problem is more cpu - intensive than the solution of auxiliary problems involved in the asymptotic case ( because efficient preconditioning techniques are available for the latter ) .",
    "numerical methods and codes used for the eigenvalue computations are adapted from zheligovsky ( 1993 ) .",
    "in we summarize our main results .",
    "here we briefly review the asymptotic expansion arising in the kinematic dynamo problem , when the scale ratio @xmath15 is small .",
    "the conducting fluid flow @xmath22 is assumed to be time - independent , and the problem therefore reduces to the eigenvalue problem for the magnetic induction operator @xmath23 in the space of solenoidal vector fields : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is magnetic molecular diffusivity , @xmath26 is a magnetic mode and @xmath27 is the associated eigenvalue ( the real part of which is here referred to as the growth rate of the mode ; negative growth rates correspond to decaying modes ) .",
    "the flow is assumed incompressible : @xmath28 @xmath29-periodic in space and parity - invariant : @xmath30    the magnetic mode @xmath31 is supposed to depend on the fast variable @xmath32 and on the slow variable @xmath33 , and is @xmath29-periodic in both fast and slow variables ( the velocity @xmath34 is independent of slow variables ) .",
    "introduction of the two spatial scales results in a `` decomposition of the gradient '' @xmath35 in and .",
    "here and in what follows the subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath36 refer to differential operators in fast and slow variables , respectively .",
    "let @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the mean ( over the periodicity cube ) and the fluctuating part of a vector field , respectively : @xmath39 parity invariance implies @xmath40 .",
    "solutions to the eigenproblem - are sought in the form of asymptotic series @xmath41 @xmath42 as shown in , substitution of these expansions in leads to a hierarchy of equations . by application of standard techniques for singular perturbation expansions , terms in the expansion eigenvalues",
    "are successively determined from solvability conditions , obtained here by just averaging the equations .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that @xmath43 , and the leading term @xmath44 in the series can be determined from the following eigenvalue problem @xmath45 subject to the solenoidality condition @xmath46    thus , the leading terms of the expansions in powers of @xmath15 of the mean magnetic field and of the eigenvalue turn out to be , respectively , an eigenfunction and the associated eigenvalue of a partial differential operator comprised only of second order derivatives , which may be regarded as representing an anisotropic diffusion . however , this operator is not necessarily dissipative : it may have eigenvalues with positive real parts . in this context one",
    "then may speak of negative eddy diffusivity .    as shown in eqn .",
    ", the coefficients @xmath47 of the homogenised equation are given by @xmath48 where the tensor field @xmath49 is obtained by solving a set of two auxiliary problems : @xmath50 and @xmath51 which will be referred to as the first and the second auxiliary problem , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath52 is the unit vector in the @xmath53-th cartesian coordinate direction and superscripts denote cartesian components of vectors . for solutions to and to exist , we require that zero should not be an eigenvalue of the magnetic induction operator @xmath54 restricted to small - scale solenoidal vector fields with a vanishing mean ; by `` small - scale '' we mean independent of the slow variable . generically , this condition is satisfied .",
    "problems and are formulated with a @xmath29-periodicity boundary condition for the vector fields @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which should also have a vanishing mean .",
    "it follows that the @xmath57 s are parity - antiinvariant and solenoidal ( @xmath58 ) , and that the @xmath49 s are parity - invariant ( @xmath59  ) .",
    "since the homogenized operator defined by - has constant coefficients , its eigenvectors are fourier harmonics : @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath21 are constant vectors .",
    "the wavevector @xmath21 is taken real because we are only interested in modes uniformly bounded in the entire space . substitution in - yields @xmath62 @xmath63",
    "following gama  ( 1994 ) , we now ask how common is the phenomenon of negative diffusivity .",
    "time - independent periodic flows , satisfying - , are represented here by their fourier series @xmath64 with random amplitude harmonics . for the velocity to be real , @xmath65 , and",
    "parity invariance requires re@xmath66=0 .",
    "we study two ensembles of flows with different types of fall - offs of the energy spectrum @xmath67 .",
    "the latter is defined as the total energy contained in harmonics , whose wavevectors @xmath68 belong to the @xmath69-th spherical shell , i.e. @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is integer . when @xmath72 , the flow is said to have exponential spectrum ; when @xmath73 , it is said to have hyperbolic spectrum .",
    "these have respectively rapid and slow fall - offs .",
    "the spectra are band - limited and set to zero beyond wavenumber @xmath74 for the exponential case and beyond @xmath75 for the hyperbolic case .",
    "the value @xmath76 is used throughout in the exponential case .",
    "the flows are produced by the following procedure ( applied only to one half of the set of wavevectors , the second one being related by complex conjugation ) . for @xmath68 in the ball @xmath77 ,",
    "random imaginary vectors @xmath78 are generated with the imaginary part of each cartesian component uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath79 $ ] ( the ran2 random number generator by press , 1992 , is used ) .",
    "then the vectors @xmath78 are projected onto the plane perpendicular to @xmath68 to gain incompressibility . finally , the obtained vectors are normalized , so that the flow has the desired energy spectrum and the root - mean - square velocity is one , when the normalized vectors are employed as the fourier coefficients @xmath66 in .",
    "each ensemble consists of 100 flows . for each flow",
    ", computations are carried out for three values of molecular diffusivity , @xmath80  , 0.2 and 0.1  .",
    "note that when @xmath9 is too large , no dynamo action can take place at large or small scales because the eddy diffusivity will basically be equal to the molecular diffusitivity .",
    "( in contrast , an alpha - effect dynamo is still possible if the system is large enough ) .",
    "if @xmath9 is too small , small - scale dynamo instabilities will have much larger growth rates than large - scale instabilities . in both extreme cases it is meaningless to study negative eddy diffusivity large - scale instabilities .",
    "the range of values of @xmath9 chosen , between 0.1 and 0.3 , is an empirically determined tradeoff between these extremes .",
    "all computations are performed with the resolution of @xmath81 fourier harmonics , employing standard spectral methods based on fast fourier transforms and dealiasing .",
    "( each case requires from 10 to 30  minutes of cpu on one dec alpha  ev6 processor , depending on the value of @xmath9 . ) the power spectra of the solutions to and turn out to decrease monotonically very quickly for @xmath82 . for @xmath83 in the hyperbolic case ( resp . exponential case ) , the decrease is typically by 7 - 8 orders of magnitude ( 14 - 15 orders of magnitude ) from maximum to minimum .",
    "note that our code reproduces the negative eddy diffusivity values obtained by an alternative numerical method by lanotte  ( 1999 ) for the modified taylor  green flow .",
    "100 10 eddy diffusivity histograms    table 1 .",
    "statistics of the eddy diffusivities for the considered ensembles of flows .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     after the homogenized coefficients are determined , the minimum magnetic eddy diffusivity @xmath84 is calculated as the minimum eigenvalue of the problem - .",
    "( note , that for a unit wavevector the eigenvalue is just the opposite of the eddy diffusivity . ) for a given @xmath21 this eigenproblem yields two eigenvalues satisfying a quadratic equation ; the eigenvalues can thus be complex conjugate ( a similar phenomenon was observed for three - dimensional eddy viscosities ; see wirth , 1995 ) .",
    "then the minimum of the real part of the complex eddy diffusivity , which determines the maximum rate of instability of a large - scale magnetic perturbation , is sought . however , in our computations complex eddy diffusivities appear quite rarely .",
    "histograms of the obtained magnetic eddy diffusivities are shown in .",
    "the statistics of eddy diffusivities shown in table  1 indicate that the lower the molecular diffusivity , the higher the chance that a flow will have a negative `` eddy correction '' ( correction to the molecular value coming from the flow ) and also the higher the chance that the resulting eddy viscosity will be negative .",
    "note however that the eddy correction ( given , at least implicitly , by - ) has a complicated , generally non - monotonic , nonlinear dependence on the molecular diffusivity .",
    "table  1 also shows that flows with the exponential energy spectrum are more efficient in lowering the minimum of the eddy diffusivity than those with the hyperbolic spectrum .",
    "this suggests that low wavenumber harmonics of the underlying flow are more important for lowering than high wavenumber harmonics .",
    "examples of magnetic eigenmodes for @xmath83 are shown in figures  [ f : sample1 ] and [ f : sample2 ] .",
    "they correspond to two samples having exponential velocity spectra .",
    "the upper of each figure shows regions where @xmath85 is less than 0.2% of its maximum , hence revealing the immediate neighborhood of stagnation points .",
    "note that in consequence of parity invariance about the origin and of @xmath29-periodicity , within a basic @xmath29-periodicity cube there are in total eight points about which the flow is parity - invariant .",
    "these stagnation points are located at the vertices of a cube with side @xmath86 and they form a uniform @xmath86-periodic grid in space .",
    "the magnetic structures seen in the lower left and right of each figure are clearly located near some of those stagnation points .",
    "these structures are magnetic flux ropes of the kind considered by galloway and zheligovsky ( 1994 ) .",
    "note that only the fluctuating part of the magnetic eigenmodes are shown ( both the periodicity - box averaged magnetic field @xmath87 and the overall slow spatial factor @xmath88 are omitted ) . in @xmath87",
    "is very small ( about two orders of magnitude smaller than the fluctuating field ) , whereas for the case of it is of the same order of magnitude as the fluctuating field .",
    "100 10 eigenmode sample 1 ( exponential spectrum )    100 10 eigenmode sample 2 ( exponential spectrum )    100 10 eddy diffusivity vs growth rate ( exponential spectrum )    100 10 eddy diffusivity vs growth rate ( hyperbolic spectrum )    a physically important question is : which instability arises first , when magnetic molecular diffusivity is decreased , a large - scale or a small - scale one ?",
    "similarly to what was done by gama(1994 ) , for each considered pair of a flow and a molecular diffusivity , it is checked that small - scale magnetic fields with a vanishing mean are stable , i.e. have negative growth rate ( see figures  [ f : dotsntrianglese ] and  [ f : dotsntrianglesh ] ) .",
    "100 10 infinitely low eddy diffusivity    several `` outliers '' with relatively large negative eddy diffusivities can be seen on the histograms shown on for @xmath83  .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "we see on figures  [ f : dotsntrianglese ] and  [ f : dotsntrianglesh ] that in the case of outliers the growth rate of _ small - scale _ magnetic modes ( plotted horizontally ) is negative , but close to zero .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that the corresponding eigenvalue is real . in other words , we are close to a non - oscillatory small - scale instability threshold .",
    "now , we observe that the expression of the eddy diffusivity , derived in and , involves the inverse of the small - scale magnetic induction operator .",
    "it is thus not surprising that large eddy diffusivities can be obtained .",
    "depending on whether a certain inequality is satisfied at the threshold , this eddy diffusivity can be either large negative or large positive ( see details in ) .",
    "we have checked numerically that the outlier eddy diffusivities are approximately inversely proportional to the small dominant eigenvalue ( see ) .",
    "note , that if we are exactly at the threshold , our two - scale expansion breaks down .",
    "a modified expansion can be carried out which takes into account the enlargement of the kernel of the magnetic induction operator @xmath89 . in the presence of a large - scale perturbation",
    "this can lead to an eigenvalue @xmath90 rather than the @xmath91-dependence obtained in the general parity - invariant case .",
    "in other words , the large - scale dynamics can be governed by a first - order differential operator .",
    "for intermediate values of @xmath15 , corresponding to moderate scale separation , direct evaluation of the most unstable magnetic modes is desirable .",
    "computations are simplified by the fact that eigenmodes have the form , all the dependence on the slow variable @xmath33 being absorbed into an exponential factor @xmath92 .",
    "since the flow is assumed to depend only on the fast variable @xmath32 , the eigenvalue problem is reduced to a small - scale one for a _ modified operator _ by changing @xmath93 in the magnetic induction operator and in the solenoidality condition .    to find the most unstable magnetic mode one must , in principle , allow for arbitrary orientations of the vector @xmath21 .",
    "throughout this section we assume only `` binary '' @xmath21 s such that each component takes only the values 0 or 1 , so that @xmath94 may be regarded as the maximum scale - separation factor over cartesian directions .",
    "since our simulations are computationally demanding , we choose for each flow only one @xmath21-direction as follows . for a given flow and for the molecular diffusivity @xmath83",
    ", we obtain the most unstable @xmath21-directions _ in the asymptotic regime _",
    "@xmath95 from the results of .",
    "it turns out that for the cases reported in this section , these directions are approximately parallel to binary vectors with one or two non - zero components .",
    "these binary vectors are then employed when @xmath15 is finite for all values of @xmath9 studied .",
    "100 10 growth rate vs scale ratio ( a )    100 10 growth rate vs scale ratio ( b )    100 10 growth rate vs scale ratio iii    100 10 growth rate vs scale ratio iv    figures  [ f : growthvsepsilona]-[f : growthvsepsilond ] show the dominant growth rates for four different flows selected out of the ensemble of flows with hyperbolic spectrum , which sustain negative eddy diffusivity .",
    "actually , when @xmath21 has integer components , it is only necessary to make computations for @xmath96 .",
    "indeed , first note , that the modified magnetic induction operators for two values of @xmath15 differing by 1 have the same spectrum and their eigenfunctions differ by a factor @xmath97 .",
    "second , by parity invariance of the velocity , for two opposite values of @xmath15 the spectra are also the same and eigenfunctions are related by parity @xmath98 .",
    "( from this one easily deduces that the spectrum of the modified operator is complex conjugate , eigenvalues @xmath27 and @xmath99 being associated to eigenfunctions @xmath26 and @xmath100 , respectively . )",
    "hence , outside the interval @xmath96 the plots can be continued by symmetry about the vertical line @xmath18 and by 1-periodicity .",
    "the results reported here are obtained with the resolution of @xmath81 fourier harmonics .",
    "for the `` worst '' case , @xmath101 , they differ only in the third significant digit from those obtained with the resolution @xmath102 .",
    "note , that energy spectra of the computed magnetic modes decrease by at least 4 orders of magnitude for @xmath103 and by at least 5 for @xmath80  , indicating that the employed resolution is adequate .",
    "( for @xmath101 the decrease is only by 3 orders of magnitude , which may seem marginal .",
    "however , it is well - known that eigenvalues are less sensitive to insufficient resolution , than the fine structure of eigenmodes . )",
    "it is clear from figures  [ f : growthvsepsilona]-[f : growthvsepsilond ] that for all instances where the eddy diffusivity is negative ( i.e.  the graph go to zero by negative values as @xmath104 ) there is also an instability for any finite @xmath15 .",
    "the converse is , however , not always true ; for example , for the last flow ( figure  [ f : growthvsepsilond ] ) and @xmath105 there is a dynamo for @xmath106 , which disappears below @xmath107 ( the eddy diffusivity is positive ) .",
    "furthermore , inspection of figures  [ f : growthvsepsilonb]-[f : growthvsepsilond ] reveals that there can be one or more windows in scale separation , where the dynamo ( positive growth rate ) is present , whereas in figures  [ f : growthvsepsilona ] the dynamo appears to be present for all scale separations , provided the eddy diffusivity is negative . in the two windows",
    "belong to two different analytical branches of eigenvalues and eigenmodes , with the transition occurring near @xmath108  .",
    "note , that all the growth rates vanish ( quadratically ) when @xmath95 .",
    "the reason is that the small-@xmath15 eigenvalues , obtained by the two - scale expansion of , are analytic continuations of the zero eigenvalue in the small - scale problem .",
    "the presence of the eigenvalue zero is due to the structure of the magnetic induction operator , which is the curl of a first - order operator .",
    "( hence , its adjoint , acting also in the space of divergenceless functions @xmath109 has constant vectors in its kernel . )",
    "conversely , it can be demonstrated by spatial averaging of @xmath110 , that for a mode with a non - vanishing mean the associated eigenvalue equals 0 .",
    "( note , that in we restricted the operator to functions of vanishing spatial mean and thus the growth rate zero was absent from figures  [ f : dotsntrianglese ] and [ f : dotsntrianglesh ] . )    100 10 critical rm s : small - scale vs double period    we now turn to the case , where there is a finite scale separation of a factor two ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the question we address is : how does a mere doubling of the spatial period of magnetic modes ( relative to that of the basic flow ) affect generation ?",
    "more precisely : to lower the critical magnetic reynolds number , does it help to introduce such a scale separation ?",
    "we systematically compare critical numbers when @xmath19 ( no scale separation ) and @xmath18 for an ensemble of flows with hyperbolic energy spectrum .",
    "we define our magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath6 in terms of the _ largest _ scale available @xmath111 ( the inverse of the minimum wavenumber of the magnetic field ) and of the r.m.s . velocity @xmath8 . in computations",
    "@xmath112 and hence @xmath113 .",
    "when @xmath18 we face again the problem , mentioned earlier , of choosing the vectors @xmath21 . for each flow",
    "we now search for the critical @xmath16 , allowing all 7 possible binary @xmath114 .",
    "more precisely , we find an approximate ( minimum ) critical @xmath16 and the corresponding @xmath21 by running our code with @xmath102 fourier harmonics , and then refine the critical @xmath16 with @xmath81 fourier harmonics for the obtained @xmath21 .",
    "the secant method is used to find stationary modes .",
    "iterations arere terminated when the real part of the dominant eigenvalue was below @xmath115 in magnitude .",
    "this usually requires 4 - 5 iterations .",
    "as far as the accuracy of the calculation is concerned , note that in all @xmath18 runs with @xmath116 the energy spectrum decreases by at least 4 orders of magnitude , an indication that @xmath81 harmonics provide sufficient resolution . in the most demanding runs , with @xmath19 and @xmath117 , the energy spectra decrease only by 23 orders of magnitude but ,",
    "as pointed out before , eigenvalues are computed nevertheless quite accurately ( critical @xmath16 s , computed with the @xmath102 and @xmath81 resolutions , differ in the third significant digit )",
    ".    shows all the critical @xmath16 s calculated for 28 cases .",
    "two cases not shown have critical @xmath118 and @xmath119 when @xmath18 , but do not display dynamo action for any @xmath120 when @xmath19 .",
    "the results demonstrate that scale separation lowers the critical @xmath16 in all but 9 cases out of the 30 studied .",
    "note that nore  ( 1997 ) have studied a flow ( a variant of taylor  green ) for which a scale separation @xmath18 seems to lower significantly the critical magnetic reynolds number , as is the case for the helical abc flows studied by galanti  ( 1992 ) , archontis ( 2000 ) and dorch ( 2000 ) .",
    "however the nore  ( 1997 ) definition of the magnetic reynolds number uses the scale of the flow and not that of the magnetic field .",
    "if instead our definition is used , their flow appears to be just a borderline case .",
    "three main results are presented in this work .",
    "first , in , we demonstrated that parity - invariant flows possessing a negative magnetic eddy diffusivity are quite common .",
    "specifically , we generated two random ensembles of flows ; both had time - independent randomly chosen fourier components , one with an exponentially decreasing energy spectrum , the other  with a power - law decrease ( referred to as `` hyperbolic '' because the exponent is -1 ) .",
    "one hundred independent selections were made in each case and three different molecular magnetic diffusivities were used , all corresponding to small - scale magnetic reynolds numbers not exceeding ten .",
    "none of the 600 cases investigated was a small - scale dynamo .",
    "for the lowest diffusivity considered , 86% of the `` exponential '' spectrum flows and 53% of the `` hyperbolic '' spectrum flows produced a negative eddy diffusivity and , hence , can act as a large - scale dynamo ( for more details , see table  1 ) .",
    "second , several instances with particularly negative eddy diffusivities were encountered .",
