    "graphene , a mono - layer of carbon atoms disposed on an hexagonal lattice was firstly synthesized a decade ago @xcite . however , graphene was not an unknown material , but it was theoretically investigated long time ago by p. r. wallance and others @xcite as a two - dimensional graphite material .",
    "the unusual properties of graphene are owing to its dirac - like band structure , where conduction and valence bands touch at six discrete points at the edges of the honeycomb brillouin zone .",
    "the relativistic ( dirac ) character of graphene was pointed out by d.p .",

    "mele @xcite before it was created in the lab . in graphene band structure ,",
    "only two of the six dirac cones are nonequivalent being currently named as k and k points @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations at those points obey linear dirac - like energy dispersion and are responsible for many physical phenomena such as the relativistic quantum hall , the klein tunneling among others @xcite .",
    "besides , graphene quasiparticles are chiral fermions with potential applications in the so - called valleytronics @xcite .    . for double occupancy the dot level is shifted by an amount @xmath1 that describes the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the hybridization @xmath2 depends on energy @xmath3 .",
    "we consider undoped graphene electrodes with @xmath4 located at the dirac point . ]",
    "one of the successful graphene applications is found when graphene acts as a conductive material attached to a nanostructure to create a single - electron transistor circuitry @xcite .",
    "an instance is the particular case of a quantum dot carved in a graphene sheet @xcite . here , typical coulomb blockade phenomenon is observed associated to the transport of charges across the localized dot level @xcite .",
    "the linear conductance exhibits peaks at the dot resonances separated by the mean - dot level spacing and electron - electron coulomb repulsion .",
    "interestingly , transport of charges in graphene based quantum dots occur at much higher temperatures than in traditional semiconductor dots @xcite . besides , under certain circumstances many - body effects , such as the kondo effect @xcite",
    "can be observed @xcite . in reality",
    "graphene alters quite strongly kondo physics @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect in graphene has been intensively discussed in connection with the magnetic impurity problem in massless dirac fermions .",
    "the experimental measurements show that the kondo effect can be induced by lattice vacancies in graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "the kondo problem in massless dirac fermion system is indeed a particular case of the pseudo - gap anderson model @xcite where the density of states ( dos ) of conduction electrons is proportional to @xmath5 , with @xmath3 being the energy of conduction electrons and @xmath6 an exponent specific for the material .",
    "the massless dirac fermion system corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "there has been a great effort ( theory and experiment ) to describe the kondo effect in dirac - like materials .",
    "however , much less attention has received the coulomb blockade regime in which charge fluctuations are the dominant events in transport .",
    "coulomb - blockade effects are ubiquitous and govern the transport properties of a large variety of systems : quantum dots @xcite , molecular bridges , carbon nanotubes @xcite , etc .",
    "coulomb blockade transport has been investigated extensively in nanostructures attached to metallic contacts . however , when the contacts are made by graphene the coulomb blockade effect is an almost unexplored problem .",
    "the goal of this work is to investigate how coulomb blockade effects are altered by the presence of dirac - like fermions .",
    "experimentally coulomb blockade oscillations have been reported to occur in graphene quantum dots where the linear conductance oscillates with the dot gate position @xcite .",
    "graphene has been revealed as a singular material that exhibits amazing properties in a plenty of fields , namely , electronics , spintronics , optics , etc .",
    "a great portion of works has been devoted to the study of its purely electronic properties . in comparison ,",
    "its thermal properties are poorly investigated .",
    "recent measurements show that graphene offers high thermal conductance values @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "graphene based materials offer new chances to the progress of the cross - field of thermoelectricity .",
    "good thermoelectric devices at nanoscale are those where the heat dissipated or wasted is efficiently transformed into useful electricity and vice - versa @xcite .",
    "the figure of merit @xmath8 is a coefficient that quantifies the efficiency in the heat - to - electricity ( electricity - to - heat ) conversion process .",
    "when the heat is only carried out by electrons then the @xmath8 is proportional to the square of the seebeck ( thermopower ) coefficient or the ratio between the electrical and thermoelectrical linear conductances under the open - circuit condition .",
    "the purpose of our work is to analyze the thermoelectric transport through a quantum dot ( or interacting localized level ) coupled to dirac - like electrodes .",
    "we are interested in a temperature regime where charge fluctuations are important and therefore we discard the kondo physics .",
    "below we develop the theoretical model to describe this system .",
    "we will consider the simplest case where different voltages and temperatures are applied across the quantum dot .",
    "then , pure electrical , thermal , and cross - conductance responses ( thermoelectric ) are characterized by the electrical ( @xmath9 ) , thermal ( @xmath10 ) , and thermoelectrical ( @xmath11 ) conductances , respectively .",
    "our main findings indicate that graphene transistors offer extraordinary high thermoelectrical efficiencies .",
    "we report values of @xmath12 . besides , due to the strong energy dependent tunneling rates , graphene interacting quantum dots do not follow the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , our model for an interacting dot coupled to two dirac - like contacts is introduced .",
    "the onsager matrix is computed to describe electrical and heat transports when electrical and thermal biases are applied , and the seebeck and @xmath8 coefficients are defined in addition . since the transport coefficients depend on the dot green s function , it is furthermore calculated employing the equation - of - motion ( eom ) technique @xcite .",
    "our results for various transports are thoroughly explained in sec .",

    "[ fig : ldostrvsed_t ] we briefly discuss the behavior of the dot dos and the transmission coefficient .",
    "it is shown that for @xmath85 the dos displays two resonances located at @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the resonance around the fermi energy ( @xmath88 ) is very narrow in comparison with the high energy resonance which is more wider .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the hybridization depends strongly on energy .",
    "in addition , the dot dos at the fermi energy becomes maximum .",
    "nevertheless , even if the local dos reaches the highest value at @xmath89 , the transmission coefficient , evaluated at the fermi energy , vanishes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldostrvsed_t](b ) .",
    "the transmission coefficient is the product of the contact and dot density of states .",
    "the former vanishes exactly at the fermi energy giving rise to a null transmission coefficient even though the dot dos attains the highest value .",
    "the fact that the transmission coefficient gets a zero value at @xmath89 yields a two - dip structure for the electrical conductance versus the dot level position as shown below .     and ( b ) transmission coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "we consider two distinct temperatures : @xmath90 ( solid line ) and @xmath91 ( dotted line ) .",

    "now we discuss the electrical and thermal conductances when the dot level is tuned .",
    "we start by showing the evolution of the electrical conductance @xmath9 as a function of the dot level for several values of the on - site interaction @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gvsed_u ] ) . for the noninteracting case ( @xmath100 ) ,",
    "the conductance exhibits a dip ( antiresonance ) at the contact fermi energy @xmath89 . in general",
    ", the resonance happens when the localized level alignes with @xmath89 .",
    "since the contact dos vanishes at @xmath101 , we observe the antiresonance . in the presence of @xmath1 , there are two effective levels located at @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "when these two levels align with @xmath89 , the transmission again vanishes due to the nonavailability of states of the graphene contacts at @xmath89 .",
    "the transmission shows a dip that resembles a fano singularity originated when an interference event occurs .",
    "however , notice that the origin of the dip in our setup is due to the lack of electronic states of the graphene contacts instead of being produced by an interference between different paths .",
    "fano resonances are usually found in double dot systems @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that elevated values for the seebeck coefficient are encountered in double dots where fano antiresonances take place @xcite . here ,",
    "as shown later , we find similar behavior , i.e. , the occurrence of dips at the transmission leads to high thermopower values .",
    "another aspect of @xmath9 is that the peaks near to the dips are not symmetric .",
    "around @xmath92 , that is , the two maxima are different in their heights .",
    "this results from the fact that the localized level dos is not symmetric with respect to the resonance points .",

    "our purpose is to analyze the temperature dependence of the electrical @xmath9 and thermal @xmath10 conductances as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gkvsed_t](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "it is observed that @xmath9 has moderate temperature dependences as a function of the gate voltage . in the middle of the valley ,",
    "the thermal activation is not sufficient to draw a quantitative change in @xmath9 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath10 shows more dramatic behaviors as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the first remarkable fact is the absence of the dips at the resonance points .",
    "even though electrical transport is blockaded at the resonance points , the heat transports do not follow such behaviors .",
    "importantly , @xmath10 is three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath9 .",
    "this is a notable feature when compared with normal conductors that possess high electrical and thermal conductances at the same time .",
    "good thermoelectrical devices are those that display poor thermal conductances and high electrical conductances just like our graphene transistor . in metallic conductors ,",
    "the wiedemann - franz law @xmath106 is satisfied . by utilizing graphene contacts",
    ", such a relation between @xmath9 and @xmath10 does not hold anymore .",
    "consequently , the seebeck coefficient attains much higher values .",
    "this fact is precisely illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sztvsed_t](a ) where the seebeck coefficient is displayed as a function of @xmath17 for various background temperatures @xmath45 .",

    "@xmath112 is neglected since we assume the low temperature limit ( @xmath113 ) . besides",
    ", in graphene , the thermal conductance due to phonons can be tailored to get very low values even at room temperature by including anti - dots or nanoribbons in it @xcite .",
    "therefore , our calculations do not consider the phonon contribution to the thermal conductance .",
    "the reported large values of @xmath8 indicate that heat - to - electricity conversion process is performed with high efficiency .",

    "it is observed that the violation of the wiedemann - franz is nothing to do with @xmath1 .",
    "we thus conclude that the departure from the wiedemann - franz law is due to the dirac - like energy dispersion relation of the contacts .       and ( b ) thermal conductance @xmath10 versus the background temperature @xmath124 for different values of @xmath17 .",

    "the seebeck coefficient takes opposite signs .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath130 the dos has more weight at the left of the fermi energy ( so - called hole- like transport ) whereas for @xmath137 the situation is reversed ( electron - like transport ) . here",
    "is remarkable the fact that at low and moderate temperatures @xmath108 reaches considerable high values ( above @xmath138 ) .",

    "in closing , we have analyzed the linear electrical , thermal , and thermoelectrical transports for an interacting localized level coupled to dirac - like electrodes made by graphene .",
    "our results support the fact that dirac - like electrodes lead to much better thermolectrical devices with very high values for the seebeck and @xmath8 coefficients .",
    "the latter can reach values of @xmath12 . indeed , due to the strong energy dependence of the density of states of the electrodes our graphene device display a rather low thermal conductance in contrast with the high and moderate values reached for the electrical one .",
    "these two facts yield high thermoelectrical efficiencies . besides , such energy dependence is responsible for the violation of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "in addition , we report results for the conductances as a function of the background temperature .",
    "remarkably , @xmath133 and @xmath141 shows an optimal value which depends on the dot level position . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath136 grows monotonically with temperature .",
    "such growing behavior depends on the dot level position .",
    "finally , as expected the seebeck coefficient reverses its sign when transport occurs via quasi - holes and changes to quasi - electrons ( from @xmath142 to @xmath143 ) .",
