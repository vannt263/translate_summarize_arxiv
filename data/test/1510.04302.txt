    "the advent of x - ray free electron lasers ( xfels ) @xcite has enabled advances in the study of x - ray nonlinear processes @xcite , which are similar to nonlinear optics investigations and applications , that have followed the invention of the laser in 1960 .",
    "few x - ray nonlinear processes have already been observed with conventional x - ray sources . in particular",
    ", x - ray parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) is an intriguing second order nonlinear process where an x - ray pump photon of energy @xmath3 decays spontaneously into two photons , the idler and the signal with energies @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "pdc was first discussed theoretically by freund and levine @xcite and was then observed experimentally by eisenberger and mccall @xcite in 1971 .",
    "the first observations of the pdc into the extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) were reported by danino and freund @xcite about a decade later .",
    "this effect has been recently used to visualize the local optical response to euv radiation with an atom scale resolution @xcite .",
    "further improvement of pdc has recently been proposed by shwartz and collaborators@xcite .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pdc ] , x - ray pdc takes place as nonlinear diffraction in crystals with energy and momentum conservation laws given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the wave vectors of the signal , idler , and pump photons respectively whereas * q * is a crystal reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the momentum conservation is also called the phase - matching condition , and rocking the crystal means scanning the phase - matching condition . surprisingly , tamasaku and ishikawa observed asymmetric rocking curves , having not only a peak , but also a distinct dip @xcite .",
    "if there were no interactions between the pdc and the compton scattering , the rocking curve should be a lorentzian peak on a smooth compton background .",
    "instead , the rocking curve is not simple but reveals an interference with the background compton process .",
    "the resulting lineshape is similar to the one considered by fano @xcite , vittorini - oregas and biaconi @xcite . from the analysis of the fano line shape , tamasaku , sawada and ishikawa @xcite extracted the pdc nonlinear susceptibility @xmath10 .",
    "these authors noticed that a sharp peak of the nonlinear susceptibility reveals a strong resonant enhancement at the @xmath0-absorption edge of diamond .",
    "this observation contradicts previous models claiming that the core resonance suppresses the nonlinear process rather than enhances it @xcite .",
    "we present here a renormalization factor @xmath11 that captures the behavior of the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath10 at the @xmath0-absorption edge of diamond and at the @xmath1 absorption edge of si .",
    "a similar term has recently been used to explain the enhancement of the cross section observed in the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs)@xcite . the factor @xmath11 is derived by using the renormalization - group method that describes the variation in the effective coupling constant under changes of scales @xcite , and the method of dispersion relations applied to the atomic scattering factor .    ,",
    "@xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the energy - momenta of the signal , idler , and pump photons , respectively.,width=302 ]    the remainder of this article is organized as follows . after the introductory remarks contained in sec .",
    "ii introduces the model and reviews the derivation of the renormalization factor @xmath11 . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the methods for the calculations of the atomic scattering factor @xmath2 used to obtain @xmath11 and for the x - ray pdc experiments . the theoretical results are presented and compared with the experimental results in sec .",
    "important predictions of our model and the conclusions are reported in sec . v.",
    "as explained by freund and levine @xcite , the origin of the pdc nonlinearity is the doppler shift , where the induced valence charge at the idler frequency scatters x - rays at a different frequency .",
    "an effective theory for this process is therefore equivalent to an inelastic x - ray scattering by valence electrons oscillating in the idler field . in the proximity of an absorption threshold ,",
    "the idler photon generates a set of virtual intermediate states involving a core hole and a corresponding electron excited in a virtual state which can be described by an effective dielectric function @xmath14 experienced by the valence electrons .",
    "therefore , the effective coupling constant can be modified through the dielectric response if the idler photon energy is tuned near to the binding energy of a core electron level in certain materials .    in general , the dimensionless interaction of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is not constant but varies with the energy scales .",
    "in fact , the vacuum of qed can be considered as some kind of polarizable medium , where virtual pairs of fermions and anti - fermions screen the electric charge .",
    "for instance , in the standard model of particle physics , the coupling varies because of the crossing of particle production thresholds as illustrated by jegerlehner @xcite .",
    "similarly , in materials such as fete or tise@xmath15 @xcite , photons with energies at the proximity of the @xmath16 absorption threshold generate a set of virtual intermediate states involving a @xmath17 core hole and a corresponding electron excited in a @xmath18 state , which can be described by an effective dielectric function experienced by the valence electrons .",
    "therefore , we can reduce the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath19 in a material by introducing photons with energies just below the threshold of x - ray edges , thereby increasing dielectric screening . consequently , the x - ray scattering cross section @xmath20 can be significantly enhanced due to an increased background polarizability .",
    "the connection between the effective coupling @xmath19 and the length scale @xmath21 can be described by a renormalization - group equation , @xmath22 where the function @xmath23 was derived from a thermodynamic argument @xcite involving a pressure needed to set the scale of @xmath24 for a given coupling @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : rg ] implies that the x - ray scattering cross section @xmath20 is renormalized by the factor , @xmath25 , \\label{eqeta}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the dielectric constant in vacuum , @xmath27 is the fine structure constant ( i.e. the effective coupling @xmath19 when @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 is the real part of an effective dielectric function @xmath14 . near absorption edges",
    ", there are anomalous dispersions that allow x - ray pdc to be enhanced within a narrow energy range , since @xmath30 can be larger from unity in this energy domain .",
    "as already mentioned above , the compton scattering mixes with the pdc and both processes experience the same renormalization factor @xmath11 because they involve the same valence electrons embedded in the effective medium described by @xmath14 .",
    "zambianchi @xcite noticed that @xmath31 is proportional to the cross section .",
    "hence , the renormalization of the cross section also yields a renormalization for @xmath31 given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the non - resonant part of the non - linear susceptibility .",
    "the real part of the dielectric function @xmath30 contained in the exponent of @xmath11 depends on the atomic scattering factor @xmath2 trough the equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the norm of the idler wave - vector , @xmath36 is the classical electron radius and @xmath37 is the number of c or si atoms per unit volume .",
    "the factor @xmath2 can be written using the kramers - kronig transform @xcite as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective atomic charge and @xmath40 is the imaginary part of the complex scattering factor .",
    "thus , @xmath2 becomes negative when the number of anomalous electron near the absorption edge [ given by the second term on the right side of eq .",
    "[ eqf1 ] ) ] is greater than the number of electrons .",
    "moreover , both @xmath2 and @xmath29 contain the lorentz oscillator for the core electrons appearing also in the treatment of rixs and in a fit of @xmath41 proposed by tamasaku , sawada , and ishikawa @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one should notice that in resonant pdc , @xmath29 depends of the idler energy while in rixs , @xmath29 is a function of the incident energy of the photons @xcite .",
    "henke _ et al . _ @xcite have provided a complete tabulation of values for the atomic scattering factor @xmath2 calculated for all the elements @xmath42 in the energy range from 50 ev to 30 kev .",
    "however , their atomic like assumption is clearly insufficient in the vicinity of absorption edges because of condensed - matter effects @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we have calculated the atomic scattering factor from the program fdmnes ( standing for finite difference method near - edge structure ) @xcite , which is a first - principles , free and open source code .",
    "the program directly calculates the complex scattering factor @xmath43 without using the kramers - kronig transform given by eq .",
    "( [ eqf1 ] ) .",
    "fdmnes is a real - space program , that does not involve bloch states and brillouin zone samplings .",
    "therefore , whether , one considers a molecule or a periodic system , fdmnes builds a cluster around the absorbing atom .",
    "the cluster s radius is chosen large enough in order to achieve convergence with respect to the accuracy of the calculation of the final states .",
    "the program performs density - functional theory ( dft ) self - consistent calculations in the ground and the excited states .",
    "the excited - state calculation at a given edge involves the presence of the corresponding core - hole .",
    "the computed wave functions provide the matrix elements for the direct calculation of the complex scattering factors .",
    "we have used the default exchange - correlation potential of fdmnes , which is within the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "in fact , the gradient correction to lda does not give a notable difference for c and si .",
    "the core - level energy is adjusted to the experiment .",
    "many - body corrections have been implemented via a time - dependent dft ( tddft ) kernel @xcite containing the hartree term ( which gives the main effects ) and an exchange - correlation lda term .",
    "we will check that the present tddft procedure in si is validated by a very good agreement with reflectivity experiments .",
    "the lattice constants used in the present calculations were @xmath44    and @xmath45    for diamond and si , respectively . for diamond , @xmath46 @xmath47 whereas for si , @xmath48 @xmath47 .",
    "after obtaining the self - consistent electronic structure , @xmath2 was computed at the c @xmath0 edge and at the si @xmath1 edge .    to reveal the resonance effect around the absorption edge , we measured @xmath41 of silicon near the @xmath1 edge in addition to the previous report on the diamond for the @xmath0 edge @xcite with @xmath49 .",
    "the experiments were performed at the 27-m undulator beamline bl19lxu at spring-8 described by yabasi and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the pump photon energy was set to 9.67 kev , which is just above the @xmath0 edge of zn .",
    "a ( 111 ) silicon plate with a thickness of 1.0 mm was used as the nonlinear crystal .",
    "the nonlinear diffraction was measured with @xmath50 .",
    "the scattering plane was taken on the horizontal plane , and the polarization of the pump x - rays is also horizontal .",
    "the signal photon energies were selected around the silicon @xmath51 edge by a bent crystal analyzer with a ge 220 reflection .",
    "the photon energy resolution of the analyzer was measured to be 2.7 ev . in order to separate the signal from the pump beam ,",
    "a 25-@xmath52m - thick zn foil was inserted before the analyzer .",
    "the signal photon was monitored by a nai scintillation counter , whereas the idler photon was deduced by the energy conservation given in eq .",

    "edge of diamond : in the top frame the solid curve represents the model for @xmath2 as a function of the idler energy .",
    "the label `` @xmath2 solid '' emphasizes that the factor @xmath2 for the solid is different from the one calculated for free atoms .",
    "a dashed horizontal line at @xmath53 highlights the @xmath2 changes in sign . in the bottom frame",
    "the black circles and the solid curve are the @xmath31 in units of @xmath33 and the model for the renormalization factor @xmath11 respectively , plotted against the idler energy .",
    "the experimental data are reproduced from the experiment by tamasaku , sawada , and ishikawa @xcite.,width=302 ]    figure  [ f1 ] illustrates the resonant behavior of the non - linear susceptibility of diamond as a function of the idler energy @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath54 value fitted with our model is @xmath55 @xmath56/stc , where stc means the gaussian unit of statcoulomb .",
    "this value is consistent with perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the corresponding atomic scattering factor @xmath2 calculated within fdmnes is shown in the top frame of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . near the @xmath0 absorption edge",
    ", one can notice the negative excursion of @xmath2 reaching about @xmath57 that allows @xmath30 to be larger from unity near the absorption edge .",
    "the peak value of the calculated @xmath58 is 0.033 .",
    "a similar dielectric function behavior can also be seen in the optical data from the interstellar dust grains of graphite provided by draine @xcite . however , the peak for graphite is smaller than the one for diamond since the higher density of diamond leads @xmath58 to be larger by approximately the density ratio . in the bottom frame of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the resonant part of the nonlinear susceptibility obtained by tamasaku , sawada , and ishikawa @xcite is compared to the model .",
    "the overall agreement between the experimental data and @xmath11 is good below the threshold energy .",
    "some discrepancies above the absorption threshold can be explained by the fact that the present theory neglects some resonant fluorescent effects due to the core electrons @xcite .",
    "interestingly , tuning the idler photon energy above 295 ev makes @xmath30 be smaller from unity in a certain energy window .",
    "thus , @xmath31 becomes smaller than @xmath33 in this region .         for the si @xmath1 edge.,width=302 ]",
    "the measured si rocking curves corresponding to the 111 nonlinear diffraction @xcite are shown in fig  [ rock ] .",
    "the horizontal axis indicates the deviation angle @xmath59 from the phase - matching condition at each @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath4 approaches the @xmath1 threshold from below the line shape is asymmetric whereas when @xmath4 is well above threshold a dip characterizes the spectrum .",
    "the data have been fitted with the fano formula by tamasaku , sawada , and ishikawa @xcite to extract the ratio @xmath60 shown in the bottom of fig .",
    "the top of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows that the fdmnes result for @xmath2 near the @xmath1 edge predicts an amplitude of about @xmath61 after an energy of @xmath62 ev .",
    "this result is in good agreement with x - ray reflectivity measurements by tripathi _",
    "_ @xcite and validates the tddft kernel used in fdmnes .",
    "in fact , the peak value of the experimental @xmath58 is 0.024 whereas our calculated value gives 0.025 .",
    "clearly , the calculated negative excursion of @xmath2 leads to good overall agreement with the experimental ratio @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the resonant fluorescent effects neglected by the theory seem to be small at the @xmath1 edge of si .",
    "we did not measure the pump intensity in the case of si , therefore it was not possible to obtain the non linear susceptibility in units of @xmath56/stc .    interestingly ,",
    "the enhancement of @xmath41 is not observed at the si @xmath63 absorption edge around 150 ev since @xmath2 does not present any negative excursion in the @xmath63 edge energy region @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sign change in @xmath2 is a crucial condition for the resonant enhancement of @xmath31 at a given absorption edge .",
    "we have refuted the claim that the major effect of resonance is a decrease in the strength of pdc . moreover , we have explained the factor determining the renormalization of the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath10 at some absorption edges . in our model , the square of the nonlinear susceptibility",
    "@xmath31 has been connected to an effective scattering cross section , whose resonant enhancement is a function of the scattering factor @xmath2 , which is strongly modulated when the idler energy is varied across resonant absorption edges .",
    "an important prediction of our scheme is that the resonant enhancement of @xmath31 for the carbon @xmath0-edge and the si @xmath1 edge occurs only when @xmath2 becomes negative otherwise a de - enhancement is obtained .",
    "this condition for @xmath2 explains why the resonant enhancement is not observed at the @xmath63 edge of si .",
    "our first principles calculations of @xmath2 based on the fdmnes are able to faithfully reproduce the dispersion at the edges needed for the reliability of the model since they account for bonding and condensed - matter effects .",
    "finally , a related cross - sectional enhancement effect has also been observed in rixs experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , very accurate rixs and pdc experiments by xfels @xcite can lead to more fundamental theoretical insight .",
