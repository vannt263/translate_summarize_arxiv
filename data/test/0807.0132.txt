    "in the work of constructing a finite version of quantum electrodynamics @xcite , lee and wick introduced a physical massive vector field to play the role of the regulator in pauli - villars regularization , and made the mass , charge and wave function renormalizations be all finite .",
    "the lee - wick qed ( lw qed ) is poincar@xmath0 invariant , gauge invariant and unitary .",
    "recently , grinstein , oconnell and wise @xcite extended this idea to the standard model ( sm ) and proposed that a higher derivative term is added for each field in the sm . in this scenario",
    "each propagator includes an extra degree of freedom corresponding to a massive lw particle .",
    "the extended sm is shown to be free of quadratic divergences .",
    "therefore the mass of the higgs particle is stable and the hierarchy problem is solved .",
    "the lee - wick sm ( lwsm ) does not provide any information on the masses of lee - wick particles .",
    "however they are expected to have masses at tev scale in various phenomenological studies .",
    "extensive discussions of the phenomenology of the lwsm including its implications for lhc and linear collider physics @xcite , neutrino physics @xcite , the flavor changing neutral currents @xcite , the electroweak precision constraints @xcite and another lee - wick extension of the sm @xcite have been made .",
    "some theoretical works on the perturbative unitarity , the one - loop renormalization and the causality problem of the lwsm have been discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation triggered by a higher derivative term was shown in @xcite .",
    "we studied the maxwell - einstein theory in @xcite .",
    "we considered the effect of gravity by expanding the metric around the flat background spacetime and calculated the photon self - energy in the framework of the gauge independent background field method .",
    "we showed that the one - loop gravitational corrections induce a new higher derivative term with mass dimension six , which is the term needed in the lwsm . in a ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional renormalizable theory",
    ", quantum corrections will generate possible uv divergences only to the relevant and marginal operators whose mass dimensions are less than five .",
    "this assures the predictiveness of the theory .",
    "general relativity , the theory of gravitational interactions , on the other hand , is not renormalizable after quantization @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons that general relativity was considered to be incompatible with quantum mechanics . in the quantized version of general relativity , one would not be able to reabsorb all the uv divergences into the coupling constant in the original lagrangian .",
    "that is , new counterterms are needed at each order of perturbative calculations when trying to renormalize the theory .",
    "nevertheless , a modern point of view is that a non - renormalizable theory might be sensible and the reliable predictions could still be made from it within the framework of effective field theories @xcite . from the value of the only dimensional coupling constant @xmath1 , newton s constant , in hilbert - einstein lagrangian , one can see that gravitational effects are tiny at energies @xmath2 .",
    "it makes sense to treat general relativity as a low energy effective field theory of some unknown fundamental theory and consider its quantum effects @xcite .",
    "the effects due to non - renormalizable terms are suppressed by inverse powers of planck scale @xmath3 , the mass scale of new physics . in this sense , the higher derivative term permitted by symmetry should be added to the lagrangian at the beginning so that the theory is one - loop renormalizable .",
    "the modified maxwell - einstein theory contains a lee - wick vector field as an extra degree of freedom .",
    "since gravity does exist in nature , it provides a natural mechanism to the emergence of this exotic particle .",
    "different from the other scenarios , all the lee - wick fields generated in this way have their masses of order @xmath3 , and thus presently escape from any experimental measurement .    in this work",
    "we will investigate the gauge - matter - gravity system where the gravitons propagate in ( 4+n ) dimensional spacetime while the gauge and matter fields live in the normal four dimensional world .",
    "for the reason of phenomenological implications , we take the compactification scale @xmath4 of the n extra dimensions to be as low as @xmath5 .",
    "the planck scale @xmath6 of the ( 4+n ) dimensional theory is taken to be of order @xmath7 , as the case in the add model @xcite .",
    "we will show , by explicit calculations in the background field method , that up to one - loop order , quantum corrections to each sector of the gauge , fermion and scalar coming from the exchange of virtual kaluza - klein gravitons will generate a new type of divergence which corresponds to a higher derivative operator with mass dimension six .",
    "summation of the kaluza - klein towers greatly improves the coefficients of these operators up to @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , one needs to modify the lagrangian of the system and include the higher derivative operators at the beginning to absorb the divergent quantum corrections .",
    "this modification is natural and consistent with the framework of effective field theories .",
    "the modified theory now contains a lee - wick partner whose mass is at @xmath9 scale for every gauge , fermion and scalar particle . on the one hand , these lee - wick particles are the necessary components of the extension of the sm in @xcite and turn out to be interesting and significant in describing the physics at @xmath9 scale . on the other hand , to our knowledge ,",
    "they were ignored in the relevant phenomenological studies of the add model in literatures .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized into three parts . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we describe the maxwell , dirac and klein - gorden theories in the context of the add gravity .",
    "we compactify the gravity on an n - dimensional torus @xmath10 and perform a kaluza - klein decomposition . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we compute the one - loop gravitational corrections to the gauge , fermion and scalar self - energy in the framework of the background field method and discuss the implications of the higher derivative operators .",
    "the similar calculations on the various self - energy corrections have been made in the conventional gauge dependent method @xcite , where a cutoff procedure has been used in the loop momentum integrations and the summations of the kaluza - klein states . in this work",
    "we use the dimensional regularization so that one can easily track out the momenta of the background fields .",
    "we present our discussions and conclusions in the final section .",

    "the fermion is massless because we are interested in the case of high energies when electroweak symmetry is unbroken .",
    "the scalar field is taken to be real and thus it does not carry any nontrivial charges .",
    "we ignore the cosmological constant term since it is irrelevant to our discussions .",

    ", we assume that the compactification scales of the extra n - dimensional spaces @xmath25 are all roughly equal to @xmath26 .    in the following we use the background field method @xcite and choose the background spacetime to be minkowski space .",
    "the basic idea of the method is to expand the fields appearing in the classical action to the background fields and the quantum fields .",
    "the quantum fields are the variables of integration in the functional integral .",
    "a gauge choice is made in such a way that it breaks the gauge invariance of the quantum gauge field , but retains gauge invariance in terms of the background gauge field . therefore , one is able to quantize a gauge field theory without losing the explicit gauge invariance .",
    "the green s functions obey the naive ward identities of gauge invariance and even the unphysical quantities like divergent counterterms take a gauge invariant form , which makes the following discussion unambiguous .",
    "the background field method is used extensively in gravity .",

    "note that we do not include ghost parts in the lagrangian since they do not contribute to the one - loop order .",
    "now we turn to the interactions of the gravity with the gauge and matter fields . what we are concerned with are the higher derivative operators of mass dimension six from the one - loop gravitational corrections to the two - point green s functions for the gauge and matter wave operators .",
