    "the diffuse intra - group light ( igl ) component is a useful tool to measure the intensity of the tidal interactions suffered by the galaxies and to map the extension and shape of the groups gravitational potential and the dark matter halo .    in order to isolate the igl we used the ``  trous '' wavelet transform with a multi - scale vision model ( ov_wav  epitcio pereira , rabaa & da rocha 2005 ; da rocha & mendes de oliveira 2005 ) , which does not depend on `` a priori '' information .",
    "the process detects different characteristic size structures , separating the types of light source in the image .",
    "we have studied 3 hickson compact groups ( hickson 1982 ) , in different evolutionary stages , ( hcg 79 , hcg 88 and hcg 95 ) as a pilot study for an igl survey .",
    "simulated images were analyzed with ov_wav and showed that we are able to detect low - surface brightness extended structures , down to a @xmath3 per pixel , which corresponds to a 5-@xmath4-detection level in wavelet space .",
    "we have detected igl in hcg 79 and hcg 95 .",
    "hcg 79 has an irregular igl distribution , which closely matches the x - ray distribution ( pildis et al .",
    "1995 ) and is bluer than the galaxies ( ( b - r ) = 1.5 ) , possibly a mix of stripped material from the outer parts of the galaxies and blue dwarf galaxies destruction .",
    "hcg 95 has an almost spherical igl distribution , with colors typical of old stellar populations .",
    "non - detection of igl in hcg 88 indicating an early stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "we suggest an evolutionary sequence : hcg 79 , in an advanced stage of dynamical evolution ; hcg 95 , intermediate stage ; and hcg 88 , initial epoch still without igl .",
    "the presence of an igl component indicates gravitationally bound configurations in which tidal encounters already stripped a considerable fraction of mass from the member galaxies and an advanced stage of dynamical evolution , providing a test for formation and evolution models of groups .",
