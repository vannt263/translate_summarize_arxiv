    "the age estimate is from the size of the nebula and velocities found from optical spectroscopy . for the other objects with ages ,",
    "the estimate is from a tentative supernova identification , given in the next column .",
    "the identification of the crab with sn 1054 is generally considered very secure , but the other identifications are less secure .",
    "there is still some uncertainty over whether all of the events are in fact supernovae , e.g. , sn 386 @xcite .",
    "the next column indicates whether an extended supernova remnant is observed around the pwn , and the penultimate column indicates whether there is evidence for ejecta swept up by the pwn .",
    "there are indications that these nebulae are in the early phase of interaction with freely expanding ejecta .",
    "one expectation in this picture is that the pwn should shock and sweep up a shell of supernova ejecta @xcite .",
    "the shock wave is initially expected to be radiative , but it becomes nonradiative due to the decline in the supernova density . a good example of an ejecta shell is the complex of filaments in the crab nebula . in this case",
    ", there is evidence for the shock wave in the ejecta @xcite ; it may be in the process of making a transition from radiative to nonradiative . for 3c 58",
    ", there is evidence for x - ray emission from swept - up ejecta @xcite , implying the presence of a nonradiative shock .",
    "the optical emission from 054069 may be from a radiative shock @xcite .",
    "the optical emission from g292.0 + 1.8 appears to be from the vicinity of the pwn @xcite , but the relation between them has not yet been determined .",
    "another expectation of the model with expansion in ejecta is that the pulsar should be centrally located within the pwn .",
    "this appears to be true for the objects listed in table 1 , although in most cases the pwn has an asymmetric boundary .",
    "the pwn in g292.0 + 1.8 is substantially off the center of the surrounding supernova remnant , which has led to the suggestion that the pulsar has a velocity @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the pulsar is expected to move to a place in the ejecta where it is comoving with the surrounding gas and it is surrounded by uniformly expanding ejecta .",
    "some degree of asymmetry may develop if there is a gradient in the surrounding density distribution .",
    "if we assume that 3c 58 and g11.20.3 are associated with sn 1181 and sn 386 , respectively , models for the pwne can make use of the fact that the characteristic age is much larger than the true age , so that the pulsars have not significantly spun down .",
    "this allows the assumption that the pulsar power , @xmath8 , is constant during the evolution .",
    "we begin by considering the expansion of the pwn into the inner parts of the supernova ejecta .",
    "the density distribution into which the pwn initially expands can be estimated from explosion models . @xcite",
    "used simple power law models for the density distribution .",
    "more detailed models have been considered by @xcite , who give asymptotic forms for the the final density distribution at low and high velocities . for the cases to be studied here ,",
    "the asymptotic low velocity density profile is applicable over the time of interest . for an explosion in a star with a radiative envelope , the inner density profile , using eq .",
    "( 46 ) of @xcite , can be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the free expansion velocity , @xmath11 is the total ejected mass , and @xmath12 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath13 ergs . for a star with a convective envelope , the density distribution may be flatter , but the density at @xmath14 is close to the above value .",
    "the expansion of a pwn in a density distribution can be approximately treated as a thin shell driven by a uniform pressure wind bubble with adiabatic index @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the radius can be found analytically if the pulsar power , @xmath8 , is constant and the surrounding medium has a power law density distribution . as discussed above",
    ", this may be the case for 3c58 and g11.20.3 .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) of @xcite , we have @xmath16 where @xmath17 is @xmath8 in units of @xmath18 . in cases where @xmath19 , @xmath8 , and @xmath20 are known",
    ", we can solve for @xmath21 ; because @xmath22 is expected , we have an estimate of the total ejecta mass .",
    "these quantities are known for 3c 58 and g11.20.3 if the historical supernova identifications are assumed , and the results are given in table 2 .",
    "these estimates involve a spherical approximation for pwne that are apparently not spherical , but an average radius can be taken @xcite .",
    "the assumed distances are 3.2 kpc for 3c 58 @xcite and 5 kpc for g11.20.3 @xcite .",
    "the expected values of @xmath11 for a core collapse supernova are typically several @xmath23 or more . in the case of a very fast type ic supernova ,",
    "sn 1994i , @xmath11 was only @xmath24 @xcite , which is an extreme case .",
    "the point is that the model leads to a value of @xmath11 that is smaller than expected for 3c 58 .",
    "the radius is larger than would be expected if it were expanding into a normal supernova .",
    "there is no problem with g11.20.3 .",

    "an integration over the central density shows that @xmath26 , fairly independent of supernova density distribution .",
    "values of @xmath25 deduced in this way for 3c 58 and g11.20.3 are given in table 2 .",
    "the value of @xmath27 deduced for 3c 58 can be compared to the @xmath28 found from x - ray observations @xcite .",
    "again , there is a problem with the model mass being too low .",
    "the mass could be brought into agreement with the observed value if the age were increased by a factor @xmath29 .",
    "these models assume that the supernova ejecta are swept into a thin shell that remains spherically symmetric .",
    "however , the shell is being accelerated and is subjected to rayleigh - taylor instabilities , which can decrease the coupling between the pulsar wind bubble and the swept up gas . in the limit that there is no further acceleration after the ejecta are shocked , the pwn radius ( eq . [ 2 ] ) is increased by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "the masses @xmath11 and @xmath25 are increased by a factor of 2 , which does not change the conclusion about the difficulties with 3c 58 .    the model with constant @xmath8",
    "can be used to predict the internal energy in the pwn .",
    "this energy is reduced from the total deposited energy , @xmath30 , because of work done on the surrounding supernova gas . for a range of flat central density distributions ,",
    "the internal energy is @xmath31 ( table 1 of chevalier and fransson 1992 ) .",
    "the internal energy in a pwn has relativistic particle and magnetic field components ; a minimum value for the total energy in particles and fields can be found from the synchrotron luminosity and the emitting volume ( e.g. , pacholczyk 1970 ) . @xcite",
    "discuss the radio emission from the pwn in g11.20.3 .",
    "the value of the minimum energy deduced from the radio emission for the two pwne is given in table 3 .",
    "the actual energy must be larger when a larger frequency range is considered .",
    "it can be seen that there is not a problem with the energy for g11.20.3 , but that the energy in 3c 58 appears to be larger than that expected for the observed pulsar and the designated age . a larger age for",
    "3c 58 would allow a larger energy to be deposited in the nebula .",

    "the problems are that the pwn is too large to be expanding into a normal supernova , the expected mass swept up by pwn smaller than observed , and the internal energy is larger than can be supplied by the pulsar .",
    "a larger age for the remnant is consistent with the slow expansion of 3c 58 observed at both radio @xcite and optical @xcite wavelengths .",
    "one of the important properties of a pwn is the relative amount of energy in particles and in magnetic fields . in the crab nebula ,",
    "there is approximate equipartition overall in these energies . in the detailed mhd model of @xcite for the crab nebula",
    ", this property is produced by the choice of the @xmath39 parameter , the ratio of poynting flux to particle kinetic energy flux in the pulsar wind .",
    "the value @xmath40 is deduced ; the magnetic field is relatively weak in the wind and is increased by the shock compression and further compression in the decelerating postshock flow .",
    "this value of @xmath39 is close to the upper limit that is allowed in this kind of model , or the flow would not be able to decelerate to meet the outer boundary condition , but there is no particular reason for this value to be produced .    one way to estimate the overall magnetic field in a pwn",
    "is from the synchrotron break frequency , @xmath41 , and the age of the pwn .",
    "the determination of @xmath41 depends on the spectrum of the nebula .",
    "there is increasing evidence that the particle spectrum injected into pwne typically has at least one intrinsic spectral break .",
    "models for the radio to x - ray emission with a single power law injection spectrum generally fail @xcite , and the well - observed crab nebula spectrum requires an injection spectrum with a break ( e.g. , amato et al . , 2000 ) . with synchrotron losses ,",
    "the spectrum develops a further break .",
    "two pwne for which there is age information and information on @xmath41 are 3c 58 and msh 1552 . as discussed above , 3c 58 may be older than 821 years , which i consider as a lower limit ; a lower limit on the age yields an upper limit on the magnetic field .",
    "msh 1552 has been suggested to be the remnant of sn 185 , although g315.42.3 is another candidate for the remnant of this supernova @xcite .",
    "however , the large size of the nebula associated with msh 1552 @xcite indicates that it is not significantly younger than 1700 years .",
    "the determination of @xmath41 depends on the interpretation of the overall spectrum of the pwn . for 3c 58 and msh 1552 , as for most pwne",
    ", there are detections at only radio and x - ray wavelengths . however , the fact that the extent of the x - ray emission is comparable to that of the radio emission in both cases indicates that @xmath41 is not much lower than x - ray energies , assuming that particles originate close to the pulsar and move out in the nebula . in the case of 3c 58",
    ", the x - ray spectrum steepens at large radii , showing that synchrotron losses are significant in the x - ray regime @xcite .",
    "an estimate of @xmath42 is thus @xmath43 kev , which is consistent with the fact that the x - ray spectrum is somewhat steeper than the spectrum from radio to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the implications for the magnetic field and magnetic energy are given in table 4 .",
    "the magnetic field strength in msh 1552 can be estimated from similar arguments @xcite and is given in table 4 . in this scenario ,",
    "the low frequency breaks are intrinsic to the injected particle spectrum ; this is a controversial point and there have been discussions of the low frequency breaks in terms of synchrotron losses ( e.g. , woltjer et al . , 1997 on 3c 58 and roberts et al . , 2002 on g11.20.3 ) .",
    "comparison of magnetic and minimum internal energies    ccccc + object & @xmath42 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath34 + & ( kev ) & ( @xmath46 g ) & ( @xmath47 ergs ) & ( @xmath47 ergs ) + 3c 58 & 0.5 & 16 & 0.4 & 10 + msh 1552 & 1 & 8 & 0.3 & 7 +    it is also possible to estimate minimum magnetic plus particle energy , @xmath34 , from the radio synchrotron emission ( @xmath32 hz ) .",
    "the results , given in table 4 , show that the magnetic energy is considerably less than the total internal energy in both cases , so that the nebulae are particle dominated . in the context of the @xcite model",
    ", this would require a remarkably low poynting energy flux in the pulsar wind .",
    "however , the result is consistent with the finding in the @xcite model that a particle dominated wind is needed to produce a shock front and deceleration of the flow to match the outer boundary .",
    "this suggests that pulsar winds may have a range of magnetizations , giving rise to a range of nebular properties",
    ". if cases with a highly magnetized wind occur , they would give rise to something other than a standard pulsar wind nebula . in this limit , the wind termination shock moves in to the pulsar @xcite so that the immediate surroundings of the pulsar are in communication with the ambient medium .",
    "the increasing number of pwne are providing many examples which can be compared to models initially developed for the crab nebula . in a model with interaction with freely expanding supernova ejecta",
    ", the pwn properties can provide a check on the age estimate for the nebula .",
    "such models have previously been developed for the crab nebula , msh 15 - 52 , and 054069 @xcite .",
    "recent observational results on 3c 58 and g11.20.3 allow similar models to be considered for these objects , which are of special interest because of their possible identifications with historical supernovae .",
    "the models indicate that 3c 58 is older than sn 1181 , but that g11.20.3 is consistent with being the remnant of sn 386 .",
    "these tentative conclusions need to be followed up by more detailed studies of the remnants . in both cases ,",
    "the model predicts that the pwn is driving a shock front into freely expanding ejecta .",
    "gas shocked in this way may have been observed in 3c 58 @xcite , but further observations are needed .",
    "such gas has not yet been observed in g11.20.3 .",
    "the external supernova remnant interaction also provides constraints on the system .",
    "this interaction is clearly seen in g11.20.3 @xcite , but not in 3c 58 , implying interaction with low density surroundings for that case .",
    "another finding here is that the 3c 58 and msh 15 - 52 pwne are particle dominated , which requires that the pulsar winds have a very low magnetization parameter .",
    "this property may be one of the reasons why these pwne have low efficiencies of x - ray luminosity production compared to the pulsar power @xcite .",
    "3c 58 , g292.0 + 1.8 , g11.20.3 , msh 15 - 52 , and g54.1 + 0.3 all have significantly lower levels of x - ray luminosity production efficiency than the crab nebula .",
