    "an empirical tenet in the study of accreting compact objects is that their maximum radiative luminosity is about eddington luminosity , that is the limit where the inward - directed gravitational force is balanced by the outward - directed radiation force . for spherical accretion of fully ionized hydrogen",
    ", the eddington limit can be written as @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath7 is the proton mass , and @xmath8 is the black hole ( bh ) mass .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is generally used as a good proxy for the bolometric luminosity for accreting neutron stars and stellar mass bhs .",
    "the eddington argument proved very valuable in the early stages of x - ray astrophysics , to show that most galactic x - ray binaries are neutron stars @xcite .",
    "later on , dynamical mass measurements confirmed the existence of a population of galactic bhs with masses @xmath9@xmath10 ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) : they also satisfy the eddington limit , with peak luminosities @xmath11 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "the _ einstein _ satellite revealed for the first time a small number of non - nuclear x - ray sources in nearby galaxies ( particularly , in star - forming galaxies ) with apparent luminosities @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not immediately clear whether these sources could be a distinct class from galactic stellar mass bh candidates , which were just being discovered around the same years . _",
    "s relatively crude spatial resolution allowed for the possibility of source confusion in compact star - forming regions ; lack of long - term monitoring made it hard to distinguish between persistently luminous sources and transient events , _",
    "e.g. _ , young supernovae ( sne ) missed by optical observers .    in the following decade , as nearby galaxies were repeatedly observed with x - ray satellites such as _ rosat _ and _ asca _ , with superior spectral coverage and resolution , it became clear that some of those non - nuclear sources could not be sne , and had apparent luminosities well above the eddington limit of typical galactic stellar mass bhs .",
    "for example , the `` most likely interpretation '' of the brightest non - nuclear source in the spiral galaxy ngc1365 was `` an ultra - powerful x - ray binary , with either a highly super - eddington low - mass black hole or a very massive black hole '' with @xmath14@xmath15 , `` which may pose a challenge for stellar evolution models '' @xcite ; a third scenario , beamed emission , was also proposed for other sources @xcite .",
    "thirteen years later , distinguishing between those three alternative scenarios remains the unsolved fundamental question for this class of sources , despite the wealth of new discoveries from _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _",
    ", _ suzaku _ and _ swift _ , intensive modeling of their x - ray spectral and timing properties , and integrating studies of their multiband counterparts .    for a while ,",
    "different names have been in use to identify this class of accreting bhs : extraluminous x - ray binaries @xcite , superluminous x - ray sources @xcite , intermediate - luminosity x - ray objects @xcite . in recent years , the community consensus has settled on ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , adopting the terminology first used by japanese _ asca _",
    "teams @xcite .",
    "a handful ulxs are observed to exhibit strong x - ray variability at time scales as short as minutes @xcite , and many others have shown random variation at long time scales from days , weeks to years @xcite , confirming their compact nature .",
    "they are 10100 times more luminous than galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) , whose peak luminosity is about @xmath16  .",
    "as the eddington limit is proportional to the bh mass , this suggests that ulxs may contain bhs at least 10100 times more massive than galactic ones which are typically of 10  @xmath1 , and thus represents a new class of bhs with masses in the range of @xmath3@xmath4  @xmath1 , intermediate between stellar mass and supermassive bhs .",
    "however , some models suggest that the eddington limit could be violated by a factor up to @xmath1710 for stellar mass bhs @xcite , and the x - ray luminosity may be overestimated due to anisotropic emission caused by geometric beaming expected at high accretion rate @xcite . in these circumstances ,",
    "intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) are not required to interpret ulxs .",
    "a combination of super - eddington and mildly beamed emission from stellar mass bhs could account for ulxs with an apparent luminosity up to @xmath17@xmath18  @xcite .    some objects other than bhbs may appear like ulxs if their timing or multiwavelength properties are unavailable .",
    "young sne , especially of type iin , could be as luminous as @xmath19  in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "their x - ray spectrum is usually thermal and soft , and will not show chaotic variability .",
    "young x - ray pulsars could theoretically be more luminous than @xmath16  but the number of such sources appears to be very small @xcite . in general , these objects can be distinguished from accreting sources with variability @xcite , but it is possible that a sn leaves behind a compact remnant which becomes x - ray luminous when a fallback disk forms @xcite and mixed properties may be seen . in a survey of ulxs in nearby galaxies with archival _ xmm - newton _ data , it was found that the x - ray spectra of a few sources can be decomposed into a power - law component plus a thermal plasma , and in one of them x - ray variability was detected , suggesting that they may be recent sne with an accreting compact core @xcite .",
    "background active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that happen to lie behind a nearby galaxy could be misidentified as ulxs in the galaxy .",
    "their cosmological location could be revealed if redshift is measured from optical lines ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of background objects is usually high in massive , elliptical galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many ulxs are found to be spatially associated with nebulae , young star clusters , or globular clusters ; these are most likely located in the galaxy rather than foreground or background objects . even if they are identified as bhbs ,",
    "their nature is still not unique in terms of the companion star ( low mass or high mass ) , the mode of the mass transfer ( roche - lobe overflow or wind - fed ) , or the mass of the accretor ( stellar mass or intermediate mass ) .",
    "for example , @xcite found that ulxs in young , star forming galaxies are much more variable than in old , elliptical galaxies ( associated with globular clusters ) .",
    "no matter what their nature is , ulxs are of great interest in astrophysics .",
    "if they are imbhs , their formation mechanism could be rather different from typical stellar mass bhs ; extreme environment , more massive and/or less abundant progenitors are likely required @xcite .",
    "imbhs could have played an important role in the formation of supermassive bhs in the early universe and be important targets to search for gravitational wave emission @xcite . instead",
    ", if they are stellar mass bhs , it is interesting to investigate why they are so distinct from their galactic cousins . they may be good candidates for the study of the accretion physics at near or super eddington accretion rates @xcite , and they may shed light on binary stellar evolution channels not seen in our galaxy .",
    "ulxs are usually defined as non - nuclear , point - like objects which at least once have been observed at an apparent isotropic x - ray luminosity higher than that of stellar mass galactic bhs : typically , @xmath20  erg  s@xmath12 in the 0.310  kev band . some authors ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prefer to use @xmath21 ergs s@xmath12 , that is the eddington limit of the heaviest stellar bh ( @xmath22 ) expected at normal metallicity @xcite , to exclude a large number of `` faint '' ulxs that should be similar to normal galactic bhbs .",
    "such an empirical definition may have ambiguities and also include young x - ray pulsars , sne , and sn remnants as mentioned above .",
    "the consensus in the ulx community is to restrict the definition of ulxs to accreting bhs .",
    "therefore , we define ulxs as _ non - nuclear accreting bhs with peak luminosities inferred assuming isotropic emission above the eddington limit of normal stellar mass bhs_. this definition is confined to compact objects that are most likely accreting from a companion star in a binary system , but more exotic possibilities , for example isolated imbhs accreting via the bondi process from the surrounding medium are not excluded a priori .",
    "observationaly , variability information is required to define a ulx .",
    "recently , many ulxs are found to have a mechanical power output as high as in radiation @xcite . in one of them ,",
    "the mechanical output is dominant while the radiative output is way below the ulx threshold @xcite .",
    "this source is apparently not a ulx , but speculated to be an offset ulx or quiescent ulx ( see section  [ sec : bub ] for details ) .",
    "we thus define them as `` ultrapowerful sources ( upss ) '' for completeness , to standard for the same population of sources perhaps in a different state or viewing angle .",
    "a _ rosat_/hri catalog of luminous , non - nuclear x - ray sources by @xcite proved to be very important for bringing ulxs to the forefront of research , and for emphasizing the possible observational link with theoretically - predicted intermediate mass bhs , with masses @xmath23 .",
    "larger and more systematic x - ray source catalogs based on re - analysis of archival _",
    "rosat_/hri data soon followed : in particular , by @xcite , by @xcite , and by @xcite , which included 106 sources above @xmath16 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "the first xmm - newton catalog was done by @xcite .",
    "catalog with 154 sources in 82 galaxies was produced by @xcite , and 226 objects were included in the catalog by @xcite , compiled from mixed literature sources .",
    "such works allowed the first population studies of these objects as a well recognized group , and in relation to the properties of their host galaxies .",
    "they also provided the rationale for longer , targeted observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. today , the largest catalog @xcite is based on the 2xmm serendipitous survey , and contains 470 ulxs , of which 367 not listed in previous compilations .",
    "updated catalogs based on _ chandra _ observations have been compiled by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are three basic ways to explain non - nuclear systems with apparent accretion luminosities @xmath24 erg s@xmath12 , using only standard accretion physics already included in @xcite s model .",
    "we can either increase the mass of the bh ( thus , increasing its eddington limit ) , or attribute the enhanced brightness to beamed emission , or require a mass accretion rate high enough to allow the source to exceed the eddington limit by a factor of a few .",
    "it is also possible that the most luminous ulxs may be explained by a combination of all three factors . assuming solar abundances , the _ apparent _ luminosity . ] of an accreting bh",
    "is : @xmath25 @xcite , where @xmath26 is the beaming factor , and @xmath27 is the dimensionless accretion rate at large radii ( typically , the mass transfer rate from the donor star ) , that is normalized to the eddington accretion rate , typical of efficient disk accretion ; hence , a dimensionless accretion rate @xmath28 produces a luminosity @xmath29 .",
    "other authors prefer to define @xmath30 , in which case the eddington limit is reached at @xmath31 . ] : @xmath32 .",
    "let us examine the main tenets of these alternative or complementary scenarios .    _",
    "strong beaming _ ( @xmath33 )  a decade ago , accreting bhs with strongly beamed emission were already well known in extragalactic astronomy ( bl lac objects and blazars : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at least one galactic bh ( ss  433 ) was known to have semi - relativistic jets , massive outflows and likely anisotropic emission . naturally , a possible explanation for the early sample of _ rosat _ ulxs was that they were microblazars , or ss  433-like objects seen face - on @xcite .",
    "the relativistic beaming scenario soon ran into several fatal difficulties .",
    "it predicts that for every ulxs , there should also be a large number of lower - luminosity beamed sources : @xmath34 sources with apparent @xmath35 erg s@xmath12 for every ulx at @xmath36 erg s@xmath12 ; but there is no evidence of this population @xcite .",
    "instead , empirical luminosity functions show only @xmath9@xmath37 sources more luminous than @xmath16 erg s@xmath12 for every ulx at @xmath19 erg s@xmath12 @xcite , consistent with the higher end of the high - mass x - ray binary luminosity function .",
    "there is also no multiband evidence of the large number of jet sources beamed in other directions , required by this scenario @xcite .",
    "conversely , the presence of photoionized bubbles around several ulxs ( for example holmberg ii x-1 : @xcite ; ngc5408 x-1 : @xcite ) requires quasi - isotropic x - ray emission with luminosities @xmath38 erg s@xmath12 . finally , the majority of ulxs do not have radio counterparts and/or rapid x - ray variability , expected for relativistic beaming .",
    "for all those reasons , relativistic beaming is now ruled out as a general scenario .",
    "_ mild beaming and/or super - eddington accretion _",
    "( @xmath39 , @xmath40 )  when the accretion rates exceeds the eddington limit , radiatively - driven outflows are launched from the inner part of the disk , inside the spherization radius where the disk becomes geometrically thick @xcite . it was suggested @xcite that the wind may produce a funnel wall that scatters and collimates the emission along the axis perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "the apparent high luminosity of ulxs is then a combination of this mild collimation ( with @xmath41 , @xcite ) and mild super - eddington emission ( @xmath42 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "accretion rates @xmath31@xmath43 are enough to explain most or all ulxs up to luminosities @xmath44 erg s@xmath12 with bh masses @xmath45 .",
    "recent numerical radiation - magneto - hydrodynamical simulations @xcite supported and advanced earlier analytical results ( slim disk models ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the radiation - hydrodynamical simulations of , among others , @xcite",
    ". an important result of the simulations is that even a moderately super - critical mass supply @xmath46 can produce a total luminosity @xmath47 ( in rough agreement with the standard analytical scaling used earlier ) , and an apparent luminosity @xmath48 for face - on observers , due to mild collimation in the magnetized outflow @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation for ulxs relies on super - critical accretion but does not require collimation of the emerging radiation .",
    "it was suggested that radiation pressure - dominated accretion disks have strong density inhomogeneities due to the development of photon - bubble instabilities @xcite .",
    "radiation would escape from such disk regions at rates @xmath49 times above the classical eddington limit for stellar mass bhs .",
    "_ quasi - isotropic eddington luminosity _",
    "( @xmath50 , @xmath51 )  although some models and simulations offer us compelling reasons to ignore the eddington limit as a constraint for the ulx interpretation , some authors remain wary of this scenario .",
    "they point out that the eddington limit works well for galactic bhs and neutron stars .",
    "more significantly , the isotropic bolometric luminosity of the whole population of @xmath52 quasars at redshift @xmath53 in the sloan digitized sky survey is strongly eddington - limited at all bh masses , with only a very small fraction of sources between 1 and 3 @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "perhaps like the bumblebee , the eddington limit should not fly , but does .",
    "thus , it is argued that the null hypothesis for ulxs should be that their luminosities are @xmath55 , despite the difference on the gas reservoir between agn and binary systems , and their radiative anisotropy is only a factor of @xmath56 ( a standard accretion disk has a beaming factor @xmath57 in the absence of any other collimation ) .",
    "these conditions are possible to explain most ulxs up to a few @xmath58  with accreting bhs of masses @xmath59 , which is the theoretical upper limit for a direct collapse of a single stellar core in the current universe ( see section  [ sec : bhmass ] ) .",
    "sources more luminous than that may require imbhs .",
    "for example , hlx-1 in eso243 - 49 , the most luminous ulx found to date , has a peak bolometric luminosity @xmath60 erg s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "if it is eddington limited , a black hole mass of at least @xmath61 is inferred .",
    "even if super - eddington emission is allowed , an imbh is required .",
    "_ quasi - isotropic sub - eddington luminosity _",
    "( @xmath62 , @xmath63 )  finally , it is possible that ulxs are accreting at sub - eddington accretion rates with nearly isotropic emission or disk beaming , which requires the compact objects to be imbhs ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "then we expect to see similar state transition and x - ray spectral properties from both ulxs and galactic bhbs , scaled only by the mass .",
    "the emission scenarios outlined above require three different ranges of bh masses , with different formation mechanisms .    _ ordinary stellar mass bhs _ ( @xmath65 )  the first advantage of explaining ulxs with ordinary stellar mass black holes ( smbhs ) is that we already have direct evidence of their existence in the local universe .",
    "there are more than 20 bhs identified in x - ray binaries with dynamically measured masses @xmath9@xmath10 ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in the milky way ,",

    "a similarly massive bh is found in m33 x-7 ( @xmath69  @xmath1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "an accreting binary system in the nearby starburst galaxy ic 10 @xcite contains a bh with a mass of @xmath70@xmath71 ( the mass uncertainty is mainly due to the unconstrained companion mass and inclination angle of the binary plane ) .",
    "the second advantage is that they are the easiest bhs to form : standard stellar models predict smbhs as the endpoint of individual massive star evolution , for a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities .",
    "thus , the strictest constraints to smbh models for ulxs come not from the bh formation process , but from the extreme super - eddington accretion , beaming and outflows required by these models .    _",
    "massive stellar bhs _ ( @xmath72 )  the mass of a compact remnant depends both on the initial mass of the stellar progenitor , and on how much mass is lost through stellar winds during the stellar lifetime @xcite .",
    "radiatively - driven winds from massive stars are strongly dependent on their metallicity @xcite .",
    "therefore , metallicity plays an important role in stellar evolution and determines the maximal mass of a bh that can be formed via core collapse .",

    "solar metallicity ; consistent results ( upper bh mass limit @xmath76 at low metallicities ) that are obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these results can well explain the inferred bh masses in galactic x - ray binaries ( average metallicity close to the solar value ) and in the ic 10 source ( metallicity @xmath77 solar ) . in summary , current stellar evolution models predict a bh remnant distribution peaked around @xmath78 , with a tail extending up to @xmath59 . as the formation of stellar bhs more massive than @xmath79 may require rarer , more extreme conditions",
    ", we will refer to them as `` massive stellar black holes ( msbhs ) '' .",
    "there is another interesting physical difference between smbh and msbh formation , in addition to different progenitor mass and metallicity : smbhs are probably formed through a sn explosion and subsequent rapid fallback ; msbhs are probably formed from direct core collapse without an explosion @xcite .",
    "this is because for the more massive objects , the gravitational energy released during core collapse is not enough to unbind and expel the stellar envelope . at low metallicities ,",
    "the threshold for direct collapse is an initial stellar mass @xmath80 @xcite ; at solar metallicity , even the most massive stars may lose enough mass in winds and explode as sne .",

    "* ) , but because helium cores more massive than @xmath86 ( corresponding to initial stellar masses @xmath87 at zero metallicities ) undergo an electron / positron pair - instability explosion that leads to the complete disruption of the star , without bh formation @xcite .",

    ".    it has been suggested that metal - free population iii stars formed in the very early universe could reach masses of a few hundred @xmath90 @xcite , above the pair - instability limit , and thus may have collapsed into imbhs @xcite . in young and dense star clusters ,",
    "dynamical friction could lead to massive stars sinking towards the center and undergoing runaway collisions and mergers on timescales",
    "@xmath91 yr . numerical simulations suggest that such a process may result in the formation of a huge star , which may subsequently collapse into an imbh @xcite .",

    "@xcite found similar soft excesses in both ulxs and less luminous x - ray sources , implying that they are not a unique signature of imbhs in a statistical sense .",

    "@xcite first identified that an extra power - law component is required in addition to the @xmath168-free disk to fit the source spectrum .",
    "the best - fit @xmath168 value ( @xmath200 ) suggests notable advection in the disk , close to the slim disk nature rather than a standard one .",

    "this is consistent with the radiation - magnetohydrodynamic simulations that the hard , thermal and slim states could be produced under a single model with different accretion rates @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath168-free model encounters difficulties in both observation and theory . in some sources ,",
    "the disk inner temperature was found too high to be physically reasonable when fitted with the @xmath168-free model @xcite .",

    "it is interpreted as comptonization in a thin corona with temperatures typical of @xmath3  kev .",
    "however , the spectral curvature in ulxs suggests an electron temperature of a few kev and a scattering optical depth significantly higher than unity , indicative of a warm and thick corona . due to the presence of such a thick corona , the emission from the disk",
    "would be distorted and the previous interpretation , a simple summation of a cool disk and a warm corona @xcite , needs be modified consequently .",
    "@xcite revisited best quality _ xmm - newton _ data and concluded that two common features simultaneously exist in the energy spectrum of ulxs : soft excesses below 2 kev and high energy curvature above 2 kev .",
    "this is not frequently seen in the spectra of galactic bhbs when they are thought to accrete at sub - eddington level .",
    "thus , they suggested that ulxs represent a new state distinct from the four well - known states ( quiescent , hard , thermal , and steep power - law ) in galactic bhbs @xcite , and call it ultraluminous state .",
    "please refer to @xcite for a more detailed review of this state .",
    "the galactic bhb that comes closest to this state is xte  j1550@xmath93564 at the peak of its 1998 september outburst .",
    "a coupled disk - corona model @xcite was proposed to explain such state , in which the disk and corona are not independent but share the total gravitational energy release .",
    "the un - scattered outer disk is responsible for the soft excesses , while the comptonized inner disk produces the hard , curved tail .",
    "the bh mass , estimated from the unmasked temperature and radius of the underlying disk , lies in the regime of smbhs or msbhs .",
    "numerical simulations of supercritical accretion indicates that radiation pressure would power strong outflows above the disk in the inner region @xcite .",
    "the wind is optically thick and warm ( a few kev ) , and would strongly comptonize the disk emission . at high accretion rate ,",
    "the disk becomes thick and would collimate the radiation along the symmetric axis causing geometric , mild beaming with an apparent isotropic luminosity over the eddington limit by a factor up to @xmath1710 .",
    "this picture is consistent with the proposed ultraluminous state .",
    "observationally , from the spectral evolution of m33 x-8 , @xcite suggested that the outflow is launched at near - eddington luminosity , and the radius at which it is launched moves further out with increasing luminosity .",
    "if the comptonizing region is the fast outflow , rather than a static corona , it is possible that bulk motion @xcite can be as or more important than thermal comptonization , depending on the characteristics of the outflow @xcite .",
    "observationally , ulx spectra that can be formally fitted with thermal comptonization models can be equally well fitted with bulk motion models ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "the only difference is in the interpretation of the characteristic energy of the upscattering electrons .",
    "as noted by @xcite , simple physical considerations , comparisons with other astrophysical classes of outflows , and numerical simulations all suggest that super - eddington ulx outflows have a characteristic speed @xmath202 escape velocity from the launching radius , corresponding to a bulk kinetic energy @xmath203 kev for the outflowing electrons .",
    "this is similar to the characteristic energy of the spectral breaks .",
    "most ulxs and bhbs have considerable radiation output above 2  kev , while supersoft sources ( ssss ) have most of their energy released below 2  kev .",
    "canonical ssss are speculated to be powered by steady nuclear burning on the surface of white dwarfs @xcite .",

    "the nature of these peculiar sources is very uncertain .",
    "they are unlikely powered by white dwarfs , because they are too luminous ( a few times @xmath16  ) and some of them are too hot ( @xmath204  ev ) .",
    "they are also unlikely to be due to cool disks around imbhs , because such disks can not have a huge variability with a constant temperature .",
    "one possible scenario is that their emission is produced by massive outflows from supercritical accreting sources viewed at a high inclination angle @xcite .",

    "in this section the `` optical counterpart '' refers to the point - like optical source that is spatially associated with the ulx ; sources with resolved structure , such as optical and radio nebulae , will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the optical emission from the counterpart could arise from the donor star or outer accretion disk , or both .",
    "it provides interesting information regarding the binary evolution history , nature of the donor star , disk geometry , and mode of mass transfer , and would also help constrain the bh mass .",
    "several groups have modeled x - ray irradiation in order to distinguish between the contributions of the outer disk and the donor star , and constrain the intrinsic stellar properties .",

    "in addition to reproducing the observed colors and luminosity ( after accounting for irradiation and disk contribution ) , a donor star in a ulx must be able to supply a mass accretion rate @xmath213 yr@xmath12 , which requires roche lobe overflow , and to do it over a sufficiently long period of time to explain the observed number of ulxs per galaxy .",

    "the total power carried by synchrotron - emitting electrons has been estimated to be between @xmath17 a few @xmath285 erg s@xmath12 and @xmath286 erg s@xmath12 , depending on the very uncertain lower - energy cut - off of the distribution . in any case , both nebulae are much more energetic than w50 around ss433 ( @xmath17 a few @xmath287 erg s@xmath12 : @xcite ) or than the extended lobes of typical galactic microquasars such as grs1758@xmath93258 ( @xmath288 erg s@xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "ngc7793 s26 also has a large radio nebula @xcite , interpreted as a combination of flat - spectrum free - free emission ( mostly in the central region ) and steep - spectrum synchrotron emission from the radio hot spots and lobes .",
    "the energy stored in relativistic electrons is @xmath17 a few @xmath289 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "the energy content in relativistic electrons for typical ulx nebulae is only @xmath290@xmath291 of the core power  in particular , of the mechanical power when it can be reliably estimated from bubble size or optical line fluxes  integrated over the characteristic age of the bubble .",
    "the main reason is that most of the input energy is transferred to non - relativistic electrons , protons and nuclei @xcite .",
    "the fraction of energy in non - radiating particles to that in relativistic electrons in a system such as ngc7793 s26 is similar to the values found by @xcite for a sample of agn , seyfert and giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "for the same jet power , agn , ulxs and galactic microquasars may be radio louder or radio quieter depending on the amount of plasma entrained by the jets .",
    "we speculate that an interesting test may come from comparisons of the radio loudness and lobe energy in low / hard state microquasars , probably dominated by magnetically accelerated jets @xcite , and in ulxs , possibly dominated by radiation - pressure accelerated jets / outflows @xcite , with more entrainment .",
    "there is no doubt that our understanding of the phenomenology of ulxs has greatly advanced in the past decade thanks to _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and many other space- and ground - based facilities .",
    "however , the key physical issue is still unresolved : that is , whether they are powered by imbhs or normal stellar bhs .",
    "a few sources have emerged as strong imbh candidates : in particular , eso243@xmath9349 hlx-1 and m82 x-1 . on the other hand , for the majority of ulxs , there is no strong theoretical need nor compelling observational evidence for imbhs . in the absence of direct mass - function measurements from phase - resolved optical spectroscopy",
    ", we still have to rely on x - ray spectral and timing modeling and other indirect clues . reviewing the results that we have collected here ,",
    "we suggest the following conservative statement :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ulxs are a diverse population ; msbhs with moderate super - eddington accretion seem to be the easiest solution to account for most sources up to luminosities @xmath17 a few @xmath19 erg s@xmath12 ; strong beaming ( @xmath292 ) can be ruled out for the majority of ulxs ; imbhs are preferred in a few exceptional cases .",

    "this would require a new generation of x - ray telescopes with large effective area .",
    "b.   determining the relative contribution of thermal emission and comptonization component is a key test for competing accretion models .",
    "for that , multilayer - coated x - ray telescopes with good sensitivity up to a few tens of kev are needed . c.   detection of , or a more solid upper limit to broad iron k lines",
    "may constrain the properties of the inner disk .",
    "d.   high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy with gratings or microcalorimeters may constrain the metal abundance and ionization state of the inflow , the mass and energy of the outflow , and probe the absorption from the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "e.   the ulx sample within @xmath293 mpc is almost complete , and it does not contain enough sources to permit statistical studies of the luminosity distribution above @xmath294 a few @xmath58 erg s@xmath12 . a homogeneous all - sky survey , complete for ulxs up to @xmath212 mpc would allow us to determine whether or not the luminosity distribution extends unbroken up to at least @xmath18 erg s@xmath12 .",
    "such survey will hopefully be successfully conducted by _ erosita _ ; f.   repeated snapshot monitoring of nearby ulxs over the next few years will extend their long - term lightcurves enough to prove that their duty cycles and transient behavior are different from those of galactic bhs .",
    "this can be easily done with smaller x - ray missions ; g.   phase - resolved spectroscopy would lead to the measurement of radial velocity curves and mass functions .",
    "attempts to do so with 8-m class telescopes have so far been inconclusive but have suggested that it will be easily done with future 30-m class telescopes ; h.   integral - field spectroscopic studies of star forming galaxies , as well as low - frequency radio studies , may reveal fainter , older ulx bubbles or lobes , still expanding into the interstellar medium but no longer energized by a central source .",
    "this would constrain the duration of the ulx active phase ; i.   searching for compact radio jets down to a sensitivity of @xmath295jy will constrain the bh mass , in relation to other classes of accreting bhs in the fundamental plane .",
    "this may be done in the near future with the _ evla _ and with _ ska _ pathfinders , and in the more distant future with the ska itself .    in conclusion , we gather from this list that there is more than one way to skin a cat .",
    "many fundamental aspects of ulx physics will be understood with instruments already planned or under construction .",
    "thus , we anticipate a fruitful decade of ulx studies beyond the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ era .",
