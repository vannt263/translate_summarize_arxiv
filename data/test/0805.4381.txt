    "merged electron - ion beams arrangements at heavy - ion storage - rings equipped with electron coolers have evolved into powerful spectroscopic tools for studies of highly charged ions .",
    "the experiments combine high detection efficiencies associated with fast moving ion beams with cold electron and ion beams .",
    "especially resonant electron - ion recombination , also termed dielectronic recombination ( dr ) , provides access to the electronic structure of highly charged ions over a wide range of energies from below 1 mev up to several 10 kev where the k - shells of the heaviest ions can be excited .",
    "the aim of this paper is to review the most recent experimental electron - ion recombination work with an emphasis on the spectroscopy of highly charged ions . for more extensive reviews that also cover further aspects of electron - ion recombination experiments",
    "see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ( general overview over experimental work on electron - ion collisions ) , @xcite ( overview over recent atomic collision experiments at storage rings including dr ) , @xcite ( x - ray spectroscopy with few - electron highly charged ions ) , @xcite ( dr in external electromagnetic fields ) , @xcite ( dr measurements for applications in astrophysics ) , and @xcite ( summary of dr work at storage rings until 1999 ) .",
    "the experimental energy spread in electron - ion merged - beam arrangements with an electron - cooled ion beam is mainly determined by the internal energy spread of the electron beam .",
    "it is smallest at very low relative electron - ion collision energies due to the merged - beams kinematics .",
    "therefore , highest resolving powers in dr experiments require i ) a very cold electron beam and ii ) an atomic system that supports dr resonances at low relative energies , preferably below 100 mev .",
    "such systems are e.g.  the lithium - like ions f@xmath0 @xcite , na@xmath1 @xcite , and sc@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a very cold electron beam has been developed for the heavy - ion storage - ring tsr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tsr ] ) at the heidelberg max - planck - institute for nuclear physics .",
    "this high - resolution electron target @xcite uses magnetic adiabatic electron - beam expansion , adiabatic beam acceleration and , optionally , a photocathode @xcite which is operated at ln@xmath3 temperatures .",
    "thus , the electrons are already created at a much lower temperature as compared to a conventional thermal cathode .",
    "a separate electron target offers the additional advantage that the electron cooler can be used to cool the ion beam continuously during a measurement with the target . in the previous arrangement without the electron target the cooler was alternatingly switched between cooling mode and measurement mode . in comparison",
    ", the newly available twin - electron - beam technique leads to a colder ion - beam with a much better defined mean velocity .",
    "the heavy - ion storage ring tsr at the heidelberg max - planck - institute for nuclear physics is equipped with two co - propagating electron beams , the electron cooler and the high - resolution electron target .",
    "recombined ( or ionized ) ions which are produced by electron - ion collisions in the electron beams are intercepted by single - particle detectors which are located behind the first dipole magnets following the electron cooler and electron target . ]",
    "comparison of the low - energy sc@xmath2(@xmath4 ) dr spectrum measured ( symbols ) with the tsr electron cooler ( a ) @xcite and the tsr electron target ( b ) @xcite . clearly , the experimental energy spread is much lower with the electron target ( @xmath51 mev instead of 7.2 mev ) , such that features from the hyperfine structure of the @xmath6 state could be resolved .",
    "the full curve ( b ) is a fitted rate coefficient ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) based on the rmbpt cross section of ref .",
    "@xcite ( a , full shaded curve , without hyperfine splitting ) . ]    figure [ fig : sc18 ] demonstrates the progress that has been achieved with the installation of the high - resolution electron target .",
    "the displayed low - energy dr spectrum of sc@xmath2 is dominated by the three narrow resonance terms @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 predicted at 28.9 , 33.7 , and 67.8 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the cooler measurement does not resolve the two low - energy resonances individually ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sc18]a ) .",
    "in contrast , the measurement with the high - resolution electron target even resolves the hyperfine structure of the @xmath6 initial state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sc18]b , @xmath10sc has a nuclear spin of @xmath11 ) .",
    "the electron - target measurement reduced the uncertainty of the experimental @xmath9 dr resonance position at 0.06861(10 ) ev @xcite by more than an order of magnitude as compared to the cooler measurement @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to fact that the ion energy is much better defined when the twin - electron - beam technique is applied . in combination with an accurate theoretical value for the binding energy of the @xmath12 rydberg electron from relativistic many - body perturbation theory ( rmbpt ) a value for the @xmath13 energy splitting in sc@xmath2 was derived from the experimental @xmath9 dr resonance position with an uncertainty of only 4.6 ppm @xcite which is less than 1% of the few - body effects on radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "it is a factor of @xmath53 lower than the relative uncertainty of the best optical measurements of @xmath14 transition energies in highly charged ions .",
    "preliminary comparison between experimental ( full line ) and calculated ( dotted line ) kll dr spectra of hydrogenlike xe@xmath15 @xcite . ]    at the other end of the experimentally accessible energy range kll dr resonances of heavy ions can be observed which occur at relative electron - ion energies of several 10  kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xe53 ] ) . very heavy",
    "highly charged ions are routinely stored in the experimental storage ring ( esr ) at gsi in darmstadt , germany . at the esr",
    "the twin - electron - beam technique is not available and the electron cooler is used as a target for recombination experiments . since electron cooling of the ion beam requires zero relative electron - ion energy previous dr measurements with electron - cooled ion beams at the esr were limited to low relative energies of up to a few 100  ev ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a novel approach was taken for measuring high - energy kll dr resonances of hydrogenlike xe@xmath15 ions .",
    "stochastic cooling was used to reduce the internal energy spread of the ion beam and the electron cooler was exclusively used as a target for dr measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : xe53 ] @xcite shows that the experimental energy spread was almost as narrow as the natural linewidths of the dr resonances .    in a more recent experiment kll",
    "dr of hydrogenlike u@xmath16 has been investigated at the esr .",
    "because of the scaling of the natural linewidths with nuclear charge a more favorable relation between experimental energy spread and natural linewidths is expected for heavier ions . however , the u@xmath16 experiment did not yet come up to this expectation due to other experimental limitations @xcite which may be overcome in future work . nevertheless , a detailed comparison with theoretical calculations along the lines described in ref .",
    "@xcite is under way @xcite aiming at unraveling the contribution of the breit interaction to the kll dr resonance strengths ( see e.g.  ref.@xcite ) .",
    "with increasing nuclear charge the overlap of the electronic wave functions with the atomic nucleus becomes larger .",
    "consequently , the influence of the nuclear structure on the electron shell increases for heavier ions .",
    "isotope shifts of @xmath17 transition energies in few - electron highly charged ions have been observed at electron - beam ion traps ( ebit ) using optical spectroscopy @xcite .    as discussed above , the @xmath17 transition energy",
    "can also be extracted from dr measurements at storage rings .",
    "the isotope dependence of the @xmath17 transition energy is reflected in an isotope shift of dr resonances .",
    "this has been investigated theoretically @xcite and more recently also been observed experimentally with dr of li - like nd@xmath18 ions @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nd ] ) . in this",
    "work isotope shifts of dr resonances of about 40  mev were measured with uncertainties below 1 mev . moreover ,",
    "the difference between the nuclear charge radii of the isotopes with mass numbers 142 and 150 was derived with an accuracy that is competetive with that of other methods .",
    "the determination of isotope shifts from few - electron ions offers some advantages as compared to optical methods that use neutral atoms . because of the simplicity of the atomic configuration , the interpretation of the data is clear and without ambiguity . for the @xmath19 transitions of li - like ions the electronic part",
    "can be treated theoretically with high accuracy .",
    "many - body and mass effects are small and can be reliably accounted for .",
    "the novel storage - ring dr isotope - shift method can be easily extended to unstable isotopes or long - lived nuclear isomers provided that such species can be produced in sufficiently large quantities .",
    "high production yields of radioactive ions are predicted for the upcoming facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) @xcite and the dr isotope - shift method may develop into a standard tool for probing nuclear matter .",
    "low - energy nd@xmath18(@xmath4 ) dr resonances for two different neodynium isotopes @xcite . clearly",
    "the positions of all resonances shift ( by about 40 mev ) when going from the isotope with mass number 150 ( dark curve ) to the one with mass number 142 ( light curve ) . ]",
    "besides the nuclear charge distribution also the magnetic moment of the nucleus has an influence of the dr resonance structure .",
    "the hyperfine splitting of dr resonances has already been discussed ( fig.[fig : sc18]b ) and also observations of the hyperfine shift @xcite and the hyperfine quenching @xcite of dr resonances have been reported .",
    "the observed hyperfine quenching of dr resonances in experiments with zn - like pt@xmath21 @xcite and be - like ti@xmath2 @xcite is associated with the hyperfine induced @xmath22 transition in divalent atoms and ions .",
    "these transitions are presently discussed in connection with optical atomic clocks and also play a role in the determination of isotope abundances from astrophysical observations .    from a fundamental point of view",
    "hyperfine induced transitions are very sensitive probes for electron correlation effects .",
    "theoretical treatments of the hyperfine - dominated decay rates in berylliumlike ions differ by factors of up to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this difference is largely due to different treatments of electron correlation effects which are particulary influential in berylliumlike ions .",
    "experimentally , hyperfine - induced decay rates for berylliumlike ions were so far only inferred for n@xmath24 @xcite using astronomical observations of a planetary nebula and yielding an uncertainty of 33% . even at this limited precision",
    ", this result allows one to discriminate between the lifetimes predicted by atomic structure calculations @xcite that differ by a factor of almost 4 ( the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is outside the experimental error bar ) .",
    "left : close ups of the dielectronic recombination spectra @xcite for @xmath25ti@xmath2 and @xmath26ti@xmath2 ions .",
    "the dr resonances that are excited from the metastable @xmath27 state are not visible in the @xmath26ti@xmath2 spectrum , since the @xmath28 state is quenched by the hyperfine interaction after sufficiently long storage times .",
    "only resonance that are excited from the @xmath29 state occur in both spectra .",
    " right : measured ( symbols ) and fitted ( lines ) decay curves @xcite for @xmath25ti@xmath2 and @xmath26ti@xmath2 ions stored in the tsr heavy - ion storage ring .",
    "the monitored signal is the ti@xmath30 production rate at an electron - ion collision energy of 0.75  ev ( marked by the arrow in the left panel ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath31 ( upper ) curve the @xmath32 ( lower ) curve exhibits a fast decaying component which is the signature of the hyperfine induced @xmath33 transition . ]",
    "the first laboratory measurement of a hyperfine induced lifetime in a highly charged berylliumlike ion has been performed only recently @xcite . the experiment made use of fast moving ion beams in the heidelberg heavy - ion storage ring tsr .",
    "the population of the ti@xmath2(@xmath27 ) state was monitored as a function of storage time by observing the dielectronic recombination signal from a hyperfine quenched dr resonance associated with the excitation of the @xmath28 state ( fig.[fig : ti18lifetime ] , left panel ) .",
    "recombined ti@xmath30 ions were detected with nearly 100% detection efficiency .",
    "the comparison of the measured decay curves for the isotopes with atomic mass numbers @xmath31 and @xmath32 clearly reveals the hyperfine induced decay ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ti18lifetime ] , right panel ) with a theoretically predicted lifetime of @xmath52.8  s. a careful analysis of the experimental results which takes collision processes with residual gas particles and other competing decay processes into account arrives at a value of @xmath34  s @xcite which is 57% lower than the only available theoretical result .",
    "this difference is attributed to electron correlation effects that were included only approximately in the theoretical calculation . a new calculation",
    "@xcite arrives at a value of 1.49  s in better agreement with the experimental value .",
    "the new laboratory value for ti@xmath2 is almost an order of magnitude more precise than the only previous experimental value for isoelectronic n@xmath24 @xcite that was obtained from astrophysical observations and modeling .",
    "an essential feature of the storage ring method is the comparison of measured results from different isotopes with zero and nonzero nuclear spin . as compared to optical detection of the fluorescence",
    "photon the dr method offers the advantage of a much higher detection efficiency .",
    "moreover , it is readily applicable to a wide range of ions and has the potential for yielding results that are even more accurate than the ti@xmath2 value .",
    "one aspect of electron - ion recombination at heavy - ion storage rings is its use for spectroscopy of highly charged ions .",
    "two recent developments of the experimental instrumentation have significantly increased the sensitivity and thereby the relevance of this electron - collision spectroscopy , namely the high - resolution electron target at the tsr in heidelberg and the use of stochastic cooling in dr experiments at the esr in darmstadt . for the @xmath35 splitting in li - like ions electron - collision spectroscopy",
    "currently outperforms optical measurements on highly charged ions .",
    "work with exotic nuclei will hopefully flourish at the new storage ring nesr at the fair .",
    "the dr isotope - shift method will develop its full potential especially when a separate electron target will be made available in addition to the nesr electron cooler .",
