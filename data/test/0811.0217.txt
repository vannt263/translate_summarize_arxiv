    "rotating of spiral waves is a fascinating example of self - organization in various two dimensional excitable systems including belousov - zhabotinskii reaction@xcite , cardiac muscle@xcite , and co oxidation on platinum surfaces@xcite .",
    "recently , much effort has been put into the development of the analytic description of excitable system , and the spiral waves have drawn great interest and have been studied intensively in many ways@xcite .    the rotation centers of the spiral wave can be regarded as a point defect and defined in terms of a phase singularity . the control of these singular points is a very complex problem in all two - dimensional excitable system .",
    "the dynamics of spiral wave are determined not only by properties of the excitable system but also by the topological characteristic number of the spiral wave .",
    "the topological charge , which describes the strength of spiral wave phase singularity , is a basic topological number of spiral wave@xcite .",
    "it plays an essential role during the processes of creating or annihilating new spiral waves .",
    "these processes can be regarded as topological phenomena in excitable system .",
    "the mathematical description of these spiral waves relates to the notion of phase which in turn allows one to characterize spiral waves by an index .",
    "the phase field @xmath0 of spiral waves is a continuously differentiable function except at the singular points@xcite .",
    "the sites of spiral wave cores are just the phase singular points .",
    "an index , which counts the winding number of phase field around the singular point , is just the topological charge of the spiral wave . from this description ,",
    "a number of topological arguments have been applied to help us to understand the topological properties of spiral wave and some important topological constrains on behaviors of spiral wave have been investigated@xcite . however , the traditional topological theory of spiral wave is not so powerful at directly computing the singularities of phase fields , but only considers a closed path around the studied region , and uses the single - value condition to indirectly analyze the existence of spiral wave in the region .",
    "therefore , it is very important to develop a new method which can directly deduce these spiral waves in a precise topological form , and can reveal the inner structures and the branch processes ( generate , annihilate , encounter , split , or merge ) of the spiral waves .    in this paper , by making use of _ _ duan s topological current theory__@xcite , we study the inner structure of spiral wave in details . it is showed that the center of spiral wave is not only classified by topological charge , but also classified by hopf index , brouwer degree in more detail in geometry .",
    "we also investigate the evolution of spiral wave .",
    "and one sees that the spiral waves generate or annihilate at the limit points and encounter , split , or merge at the bifurcation points of the spiral wave field .",
    "furthermore , we summarize the topological constrains on the behaviors of spiral waves during the above processes .",
    "some possible applications of our topological theory of spiral wave are also discussed .",
    "excitable system is typically described in terms of reaction - diffusion models .",
    "we chose to work with a general two - variable reaction - diffusion system which mathematical description in terms of a nonlinear partial differential equation .",
    "this equation is written as @xmath1 here @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the concentrations of the reagents ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the reaction functions .",
    "the diffusion coefficients of these reagents are @xmath6 and @xmath7 . following the description in ref.@xcite",
    ", we define a complex function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the concentrations of the core of spiral wave .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the sites of the spiral waves are just the isolated zero points of the complex function @xmath8 , i.e. , the spiral wave field in two - dimensional surface , and in general , it is called the spiral core . the phase field of spiral wave is defined as the argument of the complex function @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to see that the zero points of @xmath13 are just the phase singular points of phase field @xmath0 . by using of topological viewpoints , liu et al.@xcite",
    "derived a topological expression of the charge density , which is written as @xmath15,\\label{char}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the topological charge of the @xmath17-th spiral wave .",
    "this expression also reveals the topological structure of the spiral wave . in our topological theory of spiral wave",
    ", the topological structure of spiral wave will play an essential role . in order to make the background of this paper clear ,",
    "in this section we rewrite the charge density ( [ char ] ) of spiral wave as a topological current .",
    "now we begin to derive the topological current form of the charge density of the spiral core .",
    "we know that the complex function @xmath8 can be regarded as the complex representation of a two - dimensional vector field @xmath18 .",
    "let us define the unit vector : @xmath19 .",
    "it is easy to see that the zeros of @xmath13 are just the singularities of @xmath20 .",
    "using this unit vector @xmath20 , we define a two dimensional topological current @xmath21 applying _ duan s topological current theory _ , one can obtain @xmath22 where the jacobian @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 the delta function expression ( [ delt ] ) of the topological current @xmath25 tell us that it does not vanish only when the spiral waves exist , i.e.,@xmath26 .",
    "the sites of the spiral core determine the nonzero solutions of @xmath25 .",
    "the implicit function theorem @xcite shows that under the regular condition @xmath27 the general solutions of @xmath28 can be expressed as @xmath29 from eq.([aa ] ) , it is easy to prove that @xmath30 according to the @xmath31-function theory @xcite and _ duan s topological current theory _ , one can prove that @xmath32 in which the positive integer @xmath33 is the hopf index and @xmath34 is the brouwer degree .",
    "now the density of spiral wave are expressed in terms of the complex function @xmath13 : @xmath35 this is just the charge density of spiral in ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , the total charge of the system given can be rewritten as @xmath36 where @xmath16 is just the winding number of @xmath37 around @xmath38 , the above expression reveals distinctly that the topological charge of spiral wave is not only the winding number , but also expressed by the hopf indices and brouwer degrees . for multi - armed spiral wave ,",
    "the hopf indices @xmath33 characterizes the numbers of arms in a spiral wave ( @xmath39 , a one - armed spiral wave ; @xmath40 , a two - armed spiral wave ) . and the brouwer degree @xmath41",
    ", whose sign is very important , characterizes the direction of rotation of spiral wave ( @xmath42 , the spiral wave rotating clockwise ; @xmath43 , he spiral wave rotating anti - clockwise ) .",
    "it is seen that our topological theory provides a more detailed description of the inner structures of spiral wave .",
    "the topological inner structure showed in eq .",
    "( [ rot ] ) is more essential than that in eq .",
    "( [ char ] ) , this is just the advantage of our topological description of the spiral wave .    according to eq.([topcu ] ) , it is easy to see that the topological current @xmath25 is identically conserved , @xmath44 this equation implies the conservation of the topological charge of spiral wave : @xmath45 which is only the topological property of the complex function @xmath13 .",
    "the conservation of the total topological charge @xmath46 is a very stronger topological constraint on spiral wave , many important properties of spiral waves due to this topological rule . in our following sections ,",
    "we discuss the generating , annihilating at the limit points and encountering , splitting , merging at the bifurcation points of complex function @xmath13 , and it shows that the conservation of the total topological charge @xmath46 is also valid in these processes .",
    "as investigated before , the zeros of the complex function @xmath13 play an important role in describing the topological structures of spiral waves .",
    "now we begin discussing the properties of the zero points , in other words , the properties of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) . as we knew before , if the jacobian @xmath47 we will have the isolated zeros of the vector field @xmath37 .",
    "the isolated solutions are called regular points . however , when the condition ( [ reu ] ) fails , the usual implicit function theorem @xcite is of no use .",
    "the above discussion will change in some way and will lead to the branch process .",
    "we denote one of the zero points as @xmath48 .",
    "if the jacobian @xmath49 we can use the jacobian @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 for the purpose of using the implicit function theorem . then we have a unique solution of eq.([aa ] ) in the neighborhood of the limit point @xmath52 @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "we call the critical points @xmath55 the limit points . in the present case ,",
    "we know that @xmath56 i.e. , @xmath57 then the taylor expansion of @xmath58 at the limit point @xmath52 is @xmath59 which is a parabola in @xmath60 plane . from eq.([cha ] ) we can obtain two solutions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which give two branch solutions ( world lines of the spiral waves ) .",
    "if @xmath63 we have the branch solutions for @xmath64 [ see fig.1(a ) ] ; otherwise , we have the branch solutions for @xmath65 [ see fig.1(b ) ] .",
    "these two cases are related to the origin and annihilation of the spiral waves .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "the identical conversation of the topological charge shows the sum of the topological charge of these final spirals must be equal to that of the original spirals at the bifurcation point , i.e. , @xmath66 for fixed @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , from the above studies , we see that the generation , annihilation , and bifurcation of spirals are not gradually changed , but suddenly changed at the critical points .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows : first , by making use of _ duan s topological current theory _ , we obtain the charge density of spiral waves and the topological inner structure of its topological charge , the spiral waves can be classified not only by their topological charges , but especially importantly by their hopf indices and brouwer degrees .",
    "this is more general than usually considered and will be helpful as a complement of the current description of spiral wave only by the winding numbers in topology .",
    "second , the evolution of spiral wave is also studied from the topological properties of a two - dimensional vector field @xmath37 .",
    "we find that there exist crucial cases of branch processes in the evolution of the spiral wave when @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 is indefinite .",
    "this means that the spiral waves are generate or annihilate at the limit points and encounter , split , or merge at the bifurcation points of the two - dimensional vector field @xmath37 , which shows that the spiral wave system is unstable at these branch points .",
    "third , we found the result that the velocity of spiral core is infinite when they are annihilating or generating , which is obtained only from the topological properties of the two - dimensional vector field @xmath37 .",
    "forth , we must pointed out that there exist two restrictions of the evolution of spiral waves .",
    "one restriction is the conservation of the topological charge of the spiral waves during the branch process [ see eqs .",
    "( [ cc1 ] ) and ( [ cc2 ] ) ] , the other restriction is that the number of different directions of the world lines of spiral waves is at most @xmath69 at the bifurcation points [ see eqs .",
    "( [ shun ] ) and ( [ dao ] ) ] .",
    "the first restriction is already known , but the second is pointed out here for the first time to our knowledge .",
    "we hope that it can be verified in the future .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that all the results in this paper have been obtained only from the viewpoint of topology without using any particular models or hypothesis and do not require the knowledge of the actual solution of the reaction - diffusion equation .    in this paper , we give a rigorous and general topological investigation of spiral wave .",
    "this work can be applied in several ways .",
    "first , topology and geometry of two - dimensional manifold in which the spiral lived can affect the dynamics of spiral wave@xcite , therefore , it is very interesting to extend our work to a curved surface which have complex topology and geometry , and study the interaction between the topology of spiral wave and the topology of curved surface .",
    "second , our theory can be easily extend to the three dimensional scroll wave , which is just a three dimensional analog of spiral wave , in this situation , a more complex topology related to knots must be considered@xcite .",
    "third , our work provide a more detailed description of spiral wave , the detailed information of spiral can applied to the study of dynamics of spiral wave .",
    "these issues are very worthwhile to consider and will be investigated in our further works .    thanks to the works of dr .",
