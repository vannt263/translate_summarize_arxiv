    "the charge and magnetic instabilities of one dimensional materials are well understood in terms of fermi surface ( fs ) nesting .",
    "here it is shown that for two - dimensional materials , features in maps of the bare susceptibility can be understood in terms of a series of fs ` nesting curves ' , and the dominant instabilities are generally related to _",
    "double nesting _ features .",
    "the analysis shows how to locate these nesting features in momentum ( @xmath2 ) space , often providing analytical expressions . as an application ,",
    "the full evolution with doping of the leading magnetic instabilities for several families of cuprates is presented , both in the conventional hartree - fock ( hf ) plus rpa ( hf+rpa ) and in a gutzwiller approximation ( ga+rpa ) calculation .",
    "the analysis provides a pseudogap candidate and makes the surprising prediction that the ` checkerboards ' seen in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) studies are _ not _ the same phase as the ` stripes ' in la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lsco ) .",
    "the present results should find extensive utilization .",
    "first , for weakly correlated two - dimensional systems the hf+rpa results provide an essentially complete solution to the nesting problem , as long as the interaction @xmath0 is @xmath2-independent .",
    "the ga+rpa extends the results into the intermediate coupling regime . in both cases ,",
    "the magnetic instabilities are determined by zeroes of the stoner denominator , @xmath6 here for cuprates @xmath7 is the hubbard @xmath0 in hf+rpa , and a more complicated @xmath2-dependent object @xmath8 in the ga+rpa calculation .",
    "thus , the leading hf+rpa instability is simply associated with the maximum of the bare susceptibility @xmath9 , while the leading gutzwiller instability can be shifted by the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "it will be clear that the same analysis can be extended to any two - dimensional material .",
    "the cuprates appear to be in an intermediate coupling regime where the gutzwiller results can be expected to provide a good approximation to the phase diagram at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , in the cuprates , recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite and ` quasiparticle - gw ' ( qp - gw)@xcite calculations have been able to reproduce experimental arpes spectra of optimally and overdoped cuprates , starting essentially from lda bands and calculating the self - energy self consistently . in the qp - gw approach",
    ", the self energy is calculated as a convolution over a renormalized rpa susceptibility . not only is the low - energy dispersion renormalization reproduced , but also the ` waterfall ' effect@xcite , which represents the dressing of low - energy quasiparticles by ( mainly ) spin fluctuations .",
    "extension of these results to the hole - underdoped regime will require identification of the phase or phases responsible for the pseudogap .",
    "since these are most likely to be incommensurate density wave or ` stripe ' phases , the qmc calculations have a severe problem of limited @xmath2-resolution , while the qp - gw calculations are ideally suited to handle this .",
    "such an approach has had considerable success with electron - doped cuprates , where the leading instability is commensurate @xmath11 .",

    "we introduce the concept of nesting curve , associated with the nesting criterion @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ( anisotropic ) fermi wave vector , and we demonstrate that @xmath14 is generally associated with a double nesting .",
    "we apply this concept to the cuprates , taking the hopping parameters from tight - binding one - band fits to the lda dispersions , and show that over most of the doping range there is a unique @xmath14 , with a surprising electron - hole symmetry . in section 3 we extend this analysis to the more complicated hole doping regime for doping @xmath17 between half filled and the doping of the van hove singularity ( vhs ) . here",
    "competing magnetic phases are found , and the dominant phase is sensitive to material parameters , being different for different cuprates .",
    "section 4 describes the ga+rpa technique and introduces the corresponding @xmath18 .",
    "section 5 presents the resulting gutzwiller magnetic phase diagrams .",
    "it is found that the phase diagram of la@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lsco ) is distinct from that of most other cuprates , but that for all cuprates , using a bare hubbard @xmath19 , the paramagnetic state is unstable at the ga level for all relevant dopings , including the overdoped regime .",
    "a discussion is presented in section 6 , and conclusions in section 7 .",

    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows that these and related features dominate @xmath25 over the full doping range , and further reveals a striking quasi - electron - hole symmetry of the evolution . however , instead of being symmetric about @xmath26 , the evolution is symmetric about the doping of the van hove singularity ( vhs ) , @xmath27 , where the fermi energy coincides with the vhs , @xmath28 , and the density of states ( dos ) diverges logarithmically .",

    "the _ same _ sequence is followed for hole doping , fig .  [ fig:1](b ) .",

    "a key difference is that the @xmath30-plateau of bi2201 is convex over a considerably wider doping range than in lsco , before turning concave near the vhs .",

    "tangency of two fermi surface segments [ ` nesting ' ] means a stability of fs overlap , in that the nesting persists if one displaces the nesting vector in a particular direction .",

    "a ` hot spot ' is a point of the fermi surface which is simultaneously on the antiferromagnetic ( af ) zone boundary [ diagonal of the paramagnetic brillouin zone ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : new](c ) it becomes apparent ( cf . large dot ) that the image of the af zone boundary in the extended @xmath80-map intersects the ` nesting curves ' exactly at the points of ` double nesting ' .",
    "but the image of the af zone boundary gets folded in the @xmath2-map onto the zone diagonal , @xmath81 , thereby generating the usual ann feature .",
    "thus all the diagonal ann peaks in @xmath2 arise from hot spots in @xmath82 . as the doping of the vhs",
    "is approached the hot spots move toward @xmath83 and the nesting curve moves to @xmath32 . since the susceptibility at @xmath32 is equal to the dos , it diverges at the vhs , thereby controlling the magnetic instability .",
    "the appearence of the ann peak leads to a competition between two different kinds of magnetic order , and the doping evolution of the susceptibility maps diverges . for most dispersions",

    "[ fig:4 ] , the ann intensity grows and the dominant peak changes discontinuously from the saf plateau to ann nesting . for the bi-2201 dispersion ( left column )",

    "if one unfolds the nesting curve , one sees that this happens exactly at the doping of the vhs , when the fs passes through @xmath31 .",
    "the central column , corresponding to an extreme dispersion proposed for lsco to enhance antinodal nesting , displays a much more complicated nesting map over a limited doping range close to the vhs , but also displays a dominant peak at @xmath32 exactly at the vhs .",

    "finally , for the right column , corresponding to a more conventional dispersion for lsco , the ann peak is weaker than the saf peak except in the immediate vicinity of the vhs . in this case , the dominant susceptibility peak remains commensurate at @xmath30 until the doping of the vhs , jumps to @xmath32 at the vhs , then jumps back and smoothly evolves to @xmath84 incommensurate [ this sequence can also be followed in fig .",
    "1(a),(b ) ] .",

    "the dispersion is such as to produce an ` extended vhs',@xcite which first intersects the @xmath85 axis at a point @xmath86 . for larger hole doping , the fs has two sheets , one a squarish barrel centered at @xmath32 , the other a pocket centered at @xmath31 , fig .",

    "it can be seen that the full collection of nesting curves explains all of the ridge - like features seen in the susceptibility map , and in particular allow the determination of the points of maximal susceptibility , except for the above - noted commensurability effects .",
    "note however , that despite these complications , the susceptibility peak moves to @xmath32 in a finite doping range about the point where the antinodal electron pocket shrinks to zero width .",
    "the above discussion can be summarized : in the doping between half filling and the vhs , a new susceptibility peak arises , associated with nesting of the antinodal parts of the large fs .",

    "the phase diagram for bi2201 is fairly generic , and we have found similar results for ncco , bi2212 [ neglecting bilayer splitting ] and scoc , while the lsco phase diagram is limited to the dispersion parameters of lsco(1 ) .",

    "fluctuation contributions to the energy will most likely lower the energy of the paramagnetic ( disordered ) phase further reducing the stability range of the magnetic phases .",
    "there have by now been countless calculations concerning nanoscale phase separation or stripe phases in cuprates , and this is becoming a paradigm in many other correlated electronic systems as well .",

    "of course , one possibility is that charge order arises as a secondary effect following the spin order , with @xmath118 .",

    "when @xmath122 is taken as either the hubbard @xmath0 or a long - range coulomb interaction,@xcite @xmath123 is always positive and there is no instability .",
    "moreover , from the theory of dielectric stability , it is known that @xmath123 can not fall in the range between 0 and 1 [ equivalently @xmath124 , and an instability @xmath125 must be approached through negative values of @xmath123.@xcite while a purely electronic instability could still arise via inclusion of local field effects , the most natural situation arises when electron - phonon coupling is included .",
    "a simple @xmath126 wave instability will be suppressed by the on - site coulomb repulsion as shown in ref .",
    "but one can still have instabilities in other channels .",
    "to the extent that the matrix elements which determine the channel have a smooth behavior one will have a stoner denominator similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : g1 ] ) with @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the electron - phonon coupling parameter , @xmath129 the corresponding bare phonon propagator , @xmath130 a bare phonon frequency , and @xmath131 an electron - electron dielectric constant.@xcite    thus , since the instability is also controlled by a stoner factor , the results of the present paper will also apply for charge instabilities .",
    "this is consistent with the common expectation that cdws and spin density waves ( sdws ) are controlled by the same nesting instabilities",
    ". stated differently , the stoner criterion is a formal expression of the idea that @xmath132 for an instability , where @xmath133 , the interaction energy , is represented by @xmath7 while the kinetic energy @xmath134 is measured via @xmath135 .",
    "the kinetic energy is closely tied to the band structure , and carries important material - specific information .",
    "in contrast , the potential energy is fairly featureless , leading to smoothly varying @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the locations of the instabilities are controlled by peaks in @xmath104 , and a @xmath2-dependent @xmath0 can only shift the dominant instability between two peaks of comparable height . in the remainder of this section ,",
    "when we discuss comparison to experiment , it will be seen that the present model has correctly determined the dominant @xmath2 values , but that in several cases experiment points more toward cdws than sdws .",
    "there have been a number of recent hints that the ` stripe ' order in underdoped la@xmath3a@xmath4cuo@xmath136 , a = sr ( lsco ) or ba ( lbco ) is not the same phenomenon as the ` checkerboard ' order found in sr@xmath20cuo@xmath20cl@xmath20 ( scoc ) and bi@xmath20sr@xmath20cacu@xmath20o@xmath137 ( bi-2212 ) .",
    "thus , resonant soft x - ray scattering experiments find evidence of charge order in lbco ( stripes)@xcite but not in ca@xmath20cuo@xmath20cl@xmath20 ( checkerboards)@xcite , while evidence for time reversal symmetry breaking has been found in yba@xmath20cu@xmath138o@xmath139 ( ybco ) , but not in lsco@xcite .",
    "the present results suggest a connection between the ann and checkerboard phases , in that the periodicity of the latter also scales with the antinodal nesting vector@xcite , and a further connection between the @xmath30 plateau and stripes .",
    "thus it is quite interesting to observe that the ann phase is virtually absent for the lsco(2 ) dispersion , where evidence for conventional stripes is strongest .      in 1d systems",
    "the susceptibility diverges at @xmath15 at all dopings , due to perfect ( flat band ) nesting .",
    "the present results generalize this to 2d systems : the dominant instability is generally associated with double nesting , but since @xmath104 in general does not diverge , a finite coupling @xmath0 is required to drive an instability .",
    "an exception is vhs nesting@xcite , for which @xmath104 has a logarithmic divergence . at the vhs , there are two competing instabilities , af at @xmath30 and fm at @xmath32 , corresponding to the magnetic branch of the @xmath140 phase diagram of the cuprates , and these are responsible for the commensurate pinning near @xmath30 and @xmath32 , respectively.@xcite doped away from the vhs , these instabilities evolve into the two dominant peaks of the susceptibility , and can be considered as ` generalized vhs nesting ' . as",
    "such , they dominate the magnetic physics of the cuprates over the full doping range , coextensive with the limits of the @xmath141-plateau in the susceptibility .",
    "recently , storey _ et al._@xcite proposed that the generic behavior of high - t@xmath142 cuprates could be understood if the pairing interaction ( or pairing energy cutoff ) falls off rapidly near the vhs .",
    "a recent experiment@xcite does indeed confirm that @xmath143 scales with @xmath144 , but @xmath145 .",
    "the present results suggest that most cuprates will have strong fm fluctuations near the vhs , which are incompatible with simple d - wave superconductivity .",
    "empirical evidence for fm fluctuations has been noted previously@xcite .",
    "while some previous calculations@xcite have found evidence of ferromagnetism near a vhs , others@xcite have suggested that fm instabilities were unlikely in competition with incommensurate susceptibility .",
    "the present calculations confirm that a dominant fm susceptibility should be present near the vhs .",
    "the advantage of two - dimensional materials is that it is straightforward to display the susceptibility maps and nesting curves . in 3d ,",
    "the curves become _ nesting surfaces _ and the susceptibility maps are 4-dimensional .",
    "one can speculate that the dominant susceptibility peaks correspond to triple - nesting points .",
    "for quasi-2d materials , it should be possible to analyze a series of cuts perpendicular to the ( weakly - dispersing ) @xmath146-axis .      in principle",
    ", the present results could provide information on nanoscale phase separation ( nps ) as well .",
    "one model of nps is that there are different instabilities associated with particular dopings [ e.g. , half filling and the vhs ] , and that these two phases are more stable than uniform phases at intermediate dopings . in this case , the two end phases could still be described by nesting maps , only at particular dopings .",
    "for instance , in the hf+rpa analysis of lsco(2 ) , the fm phase is stable only very close to the vhs , and could lead to nps with a second phase at the undoped insulator .",
    "the stoner criterion determines which @xmath2 value is most unstable , and the minimum @xmath0 needed to drive that instability .",
    "however , as @xmath0 increases above threshold , the @xmath2 of the ordered phase may shift .",
    "thus , at half filling , when a full gap can be formed , @xmath2 will no longer be determined by best nesting , but by the largest gap .",
    "this tends to favor more commensurate @xmath2 values , leading to a pinning of @xmath2 at these commensurate values over a wide range of parameters .",
    "we find that as @xmath0 increases , there is a first order transition from an incommensurate phase with fermi surface pockets to a commensurate [ @xmath30 or @xmath31 ] phase that is fully gapped.@xcite away from half filling , luttinger s theorem ensures the persistence of a fermi surface , so nesting instabilities should persist over a wider range of @xmath0 s .",
    "furthermore , as we have seen above , the @xmath2-value corresponding to the largest @xmath148 can shift with @xmath0 .",
    "typically , for @xmath103 the shift is to a smaller @xmath2-value , associated with an instability towards fm order ( in the magnetic channel ) or nps ( in the charge channel ) .",
    "the present results provide a constructive scheme for identifying the dominant nesting instabilities for any two dimensional material .",
    "clearly , for fermi surfaces with multiple sections , a large number of nesting curves are possible , leading to extremely complicated susceptibility maps .",
    "nevertheless , the present scheme will automatically sort out the possible double nesting peaks and follow their evolution with doping .",
    "this should allow a much more detailed understanding of 2d phase diagrams , particularly for magnetic phases , where the interaction @xmath0 has negligible @xmath2-dependence .",
    "the good agreement of the ga+rpa calculations with more detailed variational calculations at half filling@xcite and with exact and numerical results in @xmath117,@xcite and of the af+sc model in electron doped cuprates with experiments gives us confidence in the model .",
    "accordingly , we note the following three points . first , within ga+rpa",
    ", the paramagnetic state is unstable over the full hole - doping range in the cuprates , including overdoped . to avoid this conclusion , and restore a fermi liquid phase in the overdoped regime",
    ", it may be necessary to include non gaussian fluctuations@xcite or an additional doping dependence for @xmath0 .",
    "the origin of any such doping dependence lies outside the ga treatment of the hubbard model .",
    "second , the @xmath11 phase , or its incommensurate extension , is unstable against a competing ann order in [ most ] hole - doped cuprates .",
    "third , there is a material dependence to the phase diagram , and lsco may have a very different doping dependence than other cuprates .",
    "the results have been applied to a number of model dispersions for the cuprates . a possible pseudogap candidate has been identified and a distinction between stripes and checkerboards proposed .",
    "these findings will be discussed in greater detail in ensuing publications .",
