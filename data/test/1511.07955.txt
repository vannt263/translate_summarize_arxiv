    "in recent past , there were a series of cosmological observations particularly from type ia supernovae [ 1 - 3 ] , cosmic microwave background radiation [ cmbr][4 ] , baryon accoustic oscillation [ 5 , 6 ] which indicate cosmic acceleration . according to these observational evidences [ 7 - 9 ]",
    ", at present our universe consists of approximately @xmath0 non - baryonic gravitating matter ( known as dark matter ( dm ) ) , @xmath1 non - baryonic non gravitating unknown matter ( known as dark energy ( de ) ) and @xmath2 radiation and baryonic matter which is well understood by the standard models of particles .",
    "this dark matter is responsible for large scale structure formation in the universe .",
    "+   + although , the nature of the dark energy is still unknown , there are some possible candidates to describe it .",
    "a natural choice for this de is the cosmological constant which represents a vacuum energy density having constant equation of state @xmath3 and this model ( @xmath4 ) fits well with large number of observations .",
    "but it suffers from two major drawbacks namely _ fine - tuning problem _",
    "( i.e why the observed value is far below than the estimation from quantum field theory ? ) and ii ) _ coincidence problem _ ( why the constant vacuum energy and matter energy densities are precisely of the same order today ? ) as a result of these observational [ 10 ] and theoretical [ 11,12 ] probes for the cosmological constant , dynamical de models have been proposed in the literature .",
    "scalar field models [ 12 - 15 ] including quintessence , k - essence , tachyon etc have attracted lots of attention",
    ". other models of dark energy include interacting de models , braneworld models , chaplygin gas models and many others .",
    "+ dominant contribution of the dark matter and dark energy to the matter source of the universe draws a lot of interest in studying coupling between dark matter and dark energy [ 16 - 32 ] .",
    "further , recently it has been shown that proper choice of the non - gravitational interaction term may alleviate the coincidence problem [ 20 - 24 ] .",
    "+ the holographic principle asserts that the number of relevant degrees of freedom of a system dominated by gravity must vary along with the area of the surface bounding the system [ 25 ] .",
    "it is speculated in the literature that use of holographic principle [ 26 , 27 , 33 ] may shed some light into the unknown and mysterious nature of de .",
    "such a dark energy model is termed as holographic dark energy ( hde ) model .",
    "the hde model is an attempt to apply holographic principle of the theory of quantum gravity to dark energy problem .",
    "accordingly , the energy density of any given region should be bounded by that ascribed to a schwarzschild black hole that fills the same volume [ 27 , 33 ] .",
    "mathematically , it means @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the energy density for dark energy , @xmath7 is the reduced planck mass and l is the size of the region ( i.e ir cut off ) .",
    "usually from effective quantum field theory the de density can be written as [ 26,33 ] @xmath8 where the dimensionless parameter c is related to the uncertainties of the theory and factor 3 is for mathematical convenience .",
    "we can see that with l = constant , it portrays the cosmological constant model .",
    "+ there are many choices for the ir cut off of which three are widely used in the literature .",
    "+ i ) * hubble radius * i.e @xmath9 but it yields a wrong equation of state for dark energy but a correct de density which is close to the observed value [ 21,26 ] .",
    "+ ii ) * future event horizon * i.e",
    "@xmath10 : m li suggested that future event horizon should be chosen as the ir cut off to explain both the fine tuning and coincidence problem [ 27 , 32 , 34 ] .",
    "+ iii ) * ricci s scalar curvature * [ 28 - 31 , 36 ] i.e @xmath11 : the reason for choosing this length scale is that it corresponds to the size of maximal perturbation , leading to the formation of black hole .",
    "this model avoids fine tuning problem and coincidence problem .",
    "people have studied extensively both hde and interacting hde models at different length scale [ 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ] .",
    "+ in the present work we first assume hde model for @xmath10 .",
    "then we consider modified holographic dark energy model at ricci s scale ( mhrde)[40 ] .",
    "in both the cases , we have used interaction with phenomenological form .",
    "we will study the models qualitatively and will check for viable cosmological solution considering cosmological constraints and observational data . in order to study the dynamical character of the system , critical points are obtained .",
    "any standard text will explain the method [ 41 ] .",
    "corresponding cosmological models are analyzed .",
    "feasible cosmological solutions should depict our present universe as global attractor i.e all the possible initial conditions lead to the observed percentages of dark energy and dark matter , once reached , they remain fixed forever [ 42 ] .",
    "for this reason we will focus on the stability of critical points i.e cosmological models which are attractors .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : next section describes the basic equations and interaction terms of the model .",
    "section 3 presents a phase space analysis of interacting hde model taking future event horizon as ir cutoff for two type of interactions . interacting mhrde model",
    "has been considered in section 4 for phase space analysis and summary of the work has been presented in section 5 .",
    "the homogeneous and isotropic flat frw spacetime is chosen as the model of the universe .",
    "it is assumed to be filled up with dm in the form of dust ( having energy density @xmath12 ) and hde in the form of perfect fluid with variable equation of state i.e @xmath13 with @xmath14 as the energy density and thermodynamic pressure of the dark energy respectively . dark matter and dark energy interact non gravitationally with one another .",
    "the einstein field equations can be written as ( in the units : @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 @xmath17    using field equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , the acceleration of the universe is given by @xmath18\\ ] ] which shows that it is required to have @xmath19 for cosmic acceleration .",
    "introducing the density parameters , the first friedman equation ( i.e eqn ( 2 ) ) can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 with @xmath22 , the ratio of energy densities . now considering the interaction term between the two dark components the energy conservation relations take the form @xmath23 and @xmath24 here q",
    ", the interaction term is not unique .",
    "we choose @xmath25 so that there is transfer of energy from de component to dm component i.e dark energy decays into dark matter .",
    "the positivity of q ensures the validity of the second law of thermodynamics and satisfies the le chatelier s principle [ 16 ] .",
    "also @xmath25 is in favour of resolving the coincidence problem .",
    "it should be noted that we have not included baryonic matter in the interaction due to the constraints imposed by local gravity measurements [ 16 , 43 ] . in the next sections we shall consider three different choices of interaction term separately ,",
    "namely ( i ) @xmath26 the total energy density ) , ii ) @xmath27 and iii)@xmath28 .",
    "the first choice of the interaction term is a particular case of a general linear combination of the energy densities while the second choice is physically more viable in the sense that interaction rate vanishes if one of the energy densities is zero and increases with each of the densities .",
    "the radius of the event horizon is defined by the improper integral @xmath29 note that above improper integral converges only when strong energy condition is violated .",
    "so in the present accelerating phase it always exists .",
    "now choosing @xmath30 , we have from ( 1 ) @xmath31    from the conservation equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) and using the expression for energy density @xmath32 from equation ( 10 ) , the equation of state parameter takes the following form for any interaction q , @xmath33 now the second friedmann equation ( 3 ) and the energy conservation for de ( i.e equation ( 8) ) can be reduced ( after a bit simplification ) into an autonomous system as @xmath34\\ ] ] @xmath35\\ ] ] now in @xmath36 phase plane this autonomous system has a line of critical points for @xmath37 if @xmath38 we shall now analyze the evolution equations for different choices of the interaction term separately .      for the interaction , @xmath40 , the above autonomous system becomes @xmath41\\ ] ] @xmath35\\ ] ]    in the @xmath42 phase plane the autonomous system ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) has a line of critical points along the parabola @xmath43 , provided @xmath44 from the above discussion .",
    "critical points are given in table i. direction field for the autonomous system given by equation ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) is drawn in fig 1 for c = 0.65 .",
    "miao li et al studied constraints on hde model using planck data [ 44 ] .",
    "the value of c is chosen here considering the constraints on c from planck data .",
    "we can see that there is no stable critical point i.e no attractor solution exists for the system .",
    "the determinant of linearized matrix for the autonomous system along the parabola is @xmath45 representing the saddle type nature .",
    "the value of the cosmological parameters namely @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 hold along the line of critical points .",
    "so we say that along the phase paths the ratio of the energy densities bears a constant value partially solving coincidence problem and the universe will be in the phantom era representing accelerating universe .",
    "@xmath49 is one of those points lying on the line of critical points . but these points are unstable .",
    "there may be another critical point for @xmath50(0 ,  h ) , h unspecified if @xmath51 .",
    "but the critical point is non - hyperbolic in nature , the determinant being zero .",
    "therefore , no definite information about stability can be extracted from this point , but it can describe a late time acceleration .",
    "._equilibrium points , their nature for @xmath52 _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     phase portrait of this system consisting of ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) is drawn in fig 8 and fig 9 .",
    "no stable attractor exists in the figure .",
    "again , there is a line of critical points for h = 0 but not of physical interest .",
    "another critical point may be @xmath53 provided @xmath54 ( see table vii ) .",
    "we have taken negative value of @xmath55 here to have valid @xmath56 for the point @xmath57 .",
    "these points are non hyperbolic in nature so local stability is not conclusive .",
    "the present work deals with the wellknown interacting holographic dark energy model from the point of view of dynamical system analysis .",
    "the cosmic fluid consists of two interacting dark sectors namely dark matter in the form of dust and ( modified ) holographic dark energy in the form of perfect fluid .",
    "the energy density and the variable equation of state parameter for the dark energy is determined from the holographic principle .",
    "the interaction terms between the two dark sectors are chosen phenomenologically but are widely used in literature .",
    "here we have considered three choices of the interaction term to avoid mathematical complexity - i ) proportional to the total energy density of the dark sectors , ii ) proportional to the product of energy densities of dark matter and dark energy and iii ) proportional to dark energy density .",
    "however , we have not considered interaction with baryonic matter due to constraints imposed by local gravity measurements .",
    "the future event horizon is chosen as ir cut off for holographic dark energy model while ir cut off for modified holographic dark energy is chosen at ricci length scale . in both the models , with three choices of interaction ,",
    "the evolution equations are suitably reduced to an autonomous system . in most of the cases ,",
    "we have found line of critical points which are presented in tables .",
    "the nature of the hyperbolic critical points and their stability are analyzed using jacobian matrix of the dynamical system .",
    "+ we can see from the tables that for the hde model , three different interacting terms lead to same line of critical points @xmath58 with different constraints on @xmath59 and c. an arbitrary point on this curve can cross the phantom barrier depending on values of @xmath59 and c. the points @xmath60 , @xmath61 are among those points . for mhrde model @xmath62 , @xmath57 are interesting as they describe accelerating universe .",
    "but we could not conclude on stability of the above points due to their non - hyperbolic nature .",
