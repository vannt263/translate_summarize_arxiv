    "recent photometric studies have revealed unexpectedly complex color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in many globular clusters ( gcs ) , indicating that these stellar systems are not as simple as we have been assuming for decades ( see piotto 2009 for a recent review ) .",
    "@xmath1 centauri is the most famous example of a gc hosting complex multiple stellar populations .",
    "it has been known since the late nineties that its cmd shows multiple red - giant branches ( rgbs , lee et al .  1999 ,",
    "pancino et al .",
    "2000 ) , sub - giant branches ( sgbs e. g.   bellini et al .  2010 ) and multiple main sequences ( mss , anderson et al .",
    "1997 , bedin et al .",
    "2004 ) .    to date , multiple or broad rgbs have been observed in nearly all the gcs that have been observed with good signal - to - noise in the appropriate photometric bands ( e. g.  marino et al .",
    "2008 , yong et al .",
    "2008 , lee et al .",
    "2009 , lind et al .",
    "recent studies also suggest that multimodal mss could be quite common among gcs .",
    "in addition to the spectacular case of ngc 2808 , which shows three distinct mss ( piotto et al .",
    "2007 ) , double and triple mss have been observed in several gcs , including ngc 104 , ngc 6752 , and ngc 6397 ( anderson et al",
    ".  2009 , milone et al .  2010 , 2012a , b ) and have been associated to stellar generations with a different content of helium and light - elements ( e. g.  norris 2004 , piotto et al .",
    "2005 , dantona et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "also the cmds of many stellar clusters in the large and the small magellanic cloud ( lmc , smc ) are not consistent with single stellar populations ( bertelli et al .",
    "2003 , mackey et al .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2009a ) analyzed sixteen intermediate age clusters in the lmc and found that at least eleven of them ( i.e.  about the 70 % of the whole sample ) exhibit a wide spread or a split around the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) , which is consistent with the presence of multiple or prolonged star formation episodes .",
    "spectroscopic studies have long shown that most of the gcs exhibit some correlations and anticorrelations among light - element abundances ( such as the na - o anticorrelation , kraft et al .",
    "1979 , 1994 , ramirez & cohen 2002 ) .",
    "the fact that light - element variations have also been observed among unevolved stars ( e.g.  cannon et al .",
    "1998 , gratton et al . 2001 ) indicates that they have a primordial origin ( see gratton et al .",
    "2004 for a review ) .",
    "however , it must be noted that spectroscopic analysis is necessarily limited to a small sample of ( bright ) stars , and therefore allows us to identify stellar generations which may constitute only a small fraction of the cluster populations . often spectroscopy investigations can not follow multiple stellar generations in all evolving sequences ( in particular along the main sequence and the white dwarf cooling sequence ) .",
    "information on multiple stellar generations is maximized when spectroscopic and photometric data can be used together .",
    "otherwise , we must rely on photometry for a complete analysis of multiple populations ( relative fraction , radial distribution , main chemical properties ) , which manifest themselves in different ways , in different clusters and different evolutionary parts of the cmd .",
    "the multiple populations in ngc 1851 and ngc 104 manifest themselves most prominently in terms of a splitting of the sgb ( milone et al .",
    "2008 , 2012a , anderson et al .",
    "ngc 6388 also shows hints of such a splitting as well ( piotto 2008 and moretti et al .",
    "these sgb splits have been interpreted as indicating two groups of stars with either an age difference of about 1 - 2 gyrs , or a significant difference in their overall c+n+o content ( cassisi et al .",
    "2008 , ventura et al .",
    "2009 , di criscienzo et al .  2010 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present detection of the broad ( and most likely split ) sgbs in five additional milky way gcs : ngc 362 , ngc 5286 , ngc 6656 , ngc 6715 , and ngc 7089 , and confirm the presence of a double sgb in ngc 6388 , ngc 104 , and ngc 1851 .",
    "in a companion paper based on the spectroscopy of stars selected from the cmds published in this work , we have found that the two sgbs of ngc 6656 ( m22 ) are made of stars with a different content of iron , @xmath2-process elements , and c+n+o ( marino et al .",
    "a bimodality in @xmath2-elements has been also observed along the rgb of ngc 1851 and associated with the double sgb of this cluster ( e.g.  yong et al .",
    "2008 , villanova et al .",
    "2010 , lardo et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ data ] we describe the data set , the photometric reduction , the zero point calibrations , the selection of stars with high - quality photometry , and the differential - reddening correction .",
    "the initial detection of the sgb - broadenings is presented in sect .",
    "we then proceed to study the sgbs in increasing detail .",
    "we first use new and archival material : @xmath3 to derive proper motions to exclude field objects ( sect .  4 ) and @xmath4 to provide confirmation of the sgb - broadenings from several independent data - sets ( sect .  5 )",
    "section  6 then examines these sgbs through a variety of bandpasses . finally , in sect .  7 , for each cluster we compare the fractions of stars in the different sgbs with the distribution of stars along the hb in hopes of identifying the same populations in the different evolutionary branches ( sect .",
    "section  9 contains the summary of results and an examination of open questions .",
    "we have used images taken with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) , the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( wfc / acs ) , and the ultraviolet and infrared channels of the wide field camera 3 ( uvis and ir / wfc3 ) on board the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "these datasets include both proprietary images ( go11233 , go11739 , go12311 , pi piotto ) and data that we retrieved from the stsci archive . in table",
    "1 we give a summary of the adopted data sets indicating :  the cluster i d , the epoch of the observation , the number and the duration of the single exposures , the filters , the program i d , and the program pi .",
    "the astrometry and photometry of wfpc2 images have been carried out for each chip , filter and epoch independently , by adopting the method described by anderson & king ( 2000 ) based on the effective - point - spread function fitting .",
    "we corrected for the @xmath5 row error in _ hst _",
    "s wfpc2 cameras ( see anderson & king 1999 for details ) and used the distortion solution as given by anderson & king  ( 2003 ) .",
    "photometric calibration has been done according to the holtzman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) vega - mag flight system for the wfpc2 camera .",
    "the astro - photometric reduction of acs / wfc data was done with the software tools described in details by anderson et al .",
    "it consists in a package that analyzes all the exposures of each cluster simultaneously in order to generate a single list of stars for each field .",
    "stars are measured in each exposure with a library psf that is `` perturbed '' to better match the psf in that exposure .",
    "this routine was designed to work well in both crowded and uncrowded fields and it is able to detect almost every star that can be detected by eye .",
    "it takes advantage of the many independent dithered pointings of each image and the knowledge of the psf to avoid including artifacts in the list .",
    "calibration of acs photometry into the vega - mag system has been performed following recipes in bedin et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and using the zero points given in sirianni et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . for acs / wfc data coming from the gc treasury program go10775 ( pi : sarajedini ) we simply used the calibrated catalogs produced by anderson et al .",
    "( 2008 , see also sarajedini et al .",
    "2007 ) using the same procedures .",
    "we measured star positions and fluxes on the wfc3 images with a software mostly based on img2xym_wfi ( anderson et al .",
    "details on this program will be given in a stand - alone paper .",
    "star positions and fluxes have been corrected for geometric distortion and pixel - area using the solutions provided by bellini , anderson & bedin ( 2011 ) for wfc3/uvis and anderson et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for wfc3/ir .",
    "individual stars on the images may be poorly measured for several reasons : crowding by nearby neighbors , contamination from cosmic rays , or image artifacts , such as bad pixels , or diffraction spikes .",
    "the goal of the present work is to clearly identify multiple populations , which often manifest themselves as a splitting of 0.02 magnitudes or less in the cluster sequences . for this purpose",
    "we need to select the best - measured stars in the field ( i.e.  those with the lowest random and systematic errors ) , but we also need to have a large enough statistical sample to be able to identify secondary sequences that may have a much smaller fraction of stars than the primary ones .",
    "the software described in anderson et al .   ( 2008 ) provides very valuable tools to reach this goal .",
    "in addition to the stellar fluxes and positions it generates a number of parameters that can be used as diagnostics of the reliability of photometric measurements .",
    "these include a parameter , @xmath6 , related to the quality of the fit of the psf model to the star s pixels , the difference in position for each star as measured in different filters , @xmath7 , the @xmath8 of magnitudes measured in different exposures , @xmath9 , and a parameter , @xmath10 , which quantifies how much a star is contaminated from neighboring stars flux ( see anderson et al .",
    "2008 for the details ) .    to select the sample of stars with the best photometry , we adopted the following procedure , which is described in more details in sect .",
    "2.1 of milone et al .",
    "( 2009a ) . since the @xmath6 and the @xmath8 parameters exhibit a trend with the magnitude , we divided the stars into bins of 0.04 magnitude and calculated for each bin the median of the @xmath8 and @xmath6 parameters and the @xmath11 percentile ( hereafter @xmath12 ) , by means of the iterative procedure explained in milone et al .",
    "( 2009a ) .",
    "we then added to the median of each bin four times @xmath12 and interpolated these points with a spline .",
    "all the stars that lie below the spline were flagged as well - measured .",
    "the @xmath10 parameter does not show a clear trend with magnitude , so we considered all the stars with @xmath13 as well - measured . in the cases of the most crowded clusters ( namely ngc 5286 , ngc 6388 , ngc 6715 , and ngc 7089 )",
    "we have limited our investigation to stars with radial distance from the cluster center larger than 40 arcsec .",
    "the fraction @xmath14 of stars that pass all the other criteria of selection , with respect to the total number of stars changes from one cluster to the other , and strongly depends on the dataset , and less critically on the luminosity of the star . as an example , in the case of ngc 6388 , which is one the most crowded gcs of this paper , we have @xmath14=0.66 for the f606w acs / wfc go10775 images and for stars brighter than @xmath15 .",
    "specifically , @xmath078% and @xmath077% of the stars pass the criteria of selection based on the positions and magnitude @xmath8 respectively , @xmath076% of stars pass the criteria based on the @xmath6 parameter , @xmath078% that based on @xmath10 , and 66% all the criteria above . in the case of ngc6656 , the most sparse gc in our sample , for f606w acs / wfc images from go10775",
    "we have @xmath14=0.89 for stars with @xmath16 .",
    "the foreground reddening of the gcs studied in this paper goes from 0.05 ( ngc 362 ) to 0.37 ( ngc 6388 , harris 1996 , 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , variations of reddening are expected within the field of view of our target clusters .",
    "indeed , the cmds in all clusters reveal that all the cmd sequences are significantly broader than what would be expected from our photometric precision , even taking into account the small unmodelable spatial changes of the psf , which cause photometric zero - point variations usually smaller than 0.01 magnitude ( see anderson et al .",
    "2008 for details ) .    correcting for both differential reddening and the residual spatial variations of the photometric",
    "zero point represents a necessary step towards an accurate analysis of the cluster sequences . to obtain these corrections",
    ", we applied the method described in milone et al .",
    "( 2012c , sect .  3 ) .",
    "briefly , we defined the fiducial ms for the cluster and estimated , for each star , how the observed stars in its vicinity may systematically lie to the red or the blue of the fiducial sequence ; this systematic color and magnitude offset , measured along the reddening line , is indicative of the local differential reddening .    as an example , in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ map6656 ] we plot the map of differential reddening in the field of view of ngc 6656 .",
    "the cmd corrected for differential reddening is shown in the upper - right panel , while the original cmds of stars in five , distinct 1000@xmath171000 pixel regions are plotted in the lower panels .",
    "the fact that the double sgb is visible everywhere in the field of view further demonstrates that it can not be an artifact introduced by differential reddening .    in fig .",
    "[ corrnotcorr ] we show some cmds before and after our differential - reddening correction for six out of the eight clusters considered in this work .",
    "fig .  [ figsgb ] shows a zoom of the cmd region around the sgb for six of the clusters studied in this paper . among the several data sets available for each cluster",
    ", we used here the ones with the best photometric quality for sgb stars .",
    "the most intriguing feature is already evident : the sgb is much broader than expected ( indeed , in most cases split ) from photometric errors , which are smaller than 0.01 mag for these selected stars .",
    "note that the fraction of stars in the fainter sgbs differs from cluster to cluster , as discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ pratio ] .      excluding the peculiar case of @xmath1centauri , we now know from literature at least two additional gcs that show a sgb that is not consistent with a single stellar population .    the first is ngc 1851 , which exhibits two clearly distinct sgb branches with a faint sgb containing about the 35 % of the sgb stars ( milone et al .  2008 , 2009b ) .",
    "the second is 47tuc , for which evidence of multiple stellar populations along the sgb of 47tuc came from the analysis of a large number of acs/_hst _ images by anderson et al .",
    "these authors found that the sgb exhibits a clear spread in luminosity , with at least two distinct components : a brighter one with a significant spread in magnitude , and a second one about 0.05 mag fainter in the f475w band , containing about 10 % of the stars .",
    "milone et al .  ( 2012a ) found that the brighter sgb further splits into two branches , and that the presence of two stellar populations is clearly visible in the ms , rgb , and the hb .",
    "these results have stimulated us to start a deeper investigation using the wfc3/uvis camera :  go-12311 ( pi piotto ) .",
    "the @xmath18 versus @xmath19 cmd of ngc 1851 , obtained combining these data and archive ones , is shown in fig .",
    "[ sgb1851 ] .",

    "the @xmath18 versus @xmath22 and the @xmath23 versus @xmath24 cmds are plotted in the middle and the right panel and show the other two sgb branches .",
    "table  [ parameters ] shows the relevant ( for the present paper ) parameters for the eight gcs with a significant sgb broadening , and that we will discuss in the following .",
    "most of them come from harris ( 1996 , updated as in 2010 ) .",
    "hbr is the horizontal branch ratio hbr=(b - r)/(b+v+r ) , where b , r , and v are the numbers of blue hb , red hb and rr lyrae ( from harris 1996 , updated as in 2010 ) .",

    "in this paper we have shown that the galactic gcs ngc 362 , ngc 5286 , ngc 6388 , ngc 6656 , ngc 6715 , and ngc 7089 , exhibit double or broadened sgbs , similar to those identified in ngc 1851 ( milone et al .",

    "2009 , milone et al .",
    "when we compare different cmds of the same cluster made with different magnitudes and color combinations , we find that the magnitude difference between the bright and the faint sgb components remains approximately constant and does not depend on the used filters .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the split / spread sgb of the gcs studied in this paper can be interpreted in terms of two stellar groups with either a difference in age by @xmath01 - 2 gyr or a large difference in the total c+n+o abundance , as previously suggested by cassisi et al .",
