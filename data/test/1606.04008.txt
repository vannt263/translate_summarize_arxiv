    "liquid metals ( lms ) are attractive low - recycling plasma - facing materials @xcite that could protect the underlying solid walls of a fusion reactor from high heat and neutron fluxes @xcite .",
    "lithium has been frequently used @xcite , but tin , lithium - tin alloys , gallium , the molten salt flibe and other materials are also being considered @xcite .",
    "these materials introduce new diagnostic requirements compared with confinement devices featuring solid walls .",
    "for example , cdx - u and ltx were equipped with spectrometers in the visible and extreme ultraviolet , with special attention paid to neutral lithium , li ii and li iii lines @xcite .",
    "an additional diagnostic requirement is posed by the very fact that these walls are liquid and thus can deform @xcite under the effect of instabilities , turbulence , as a result of non - uniform force fields or currents from the plasma @xcite .",
    "deformations are undesired for various reasons @xcite , therefore they need to be monitored as a function of space and time , with resolutions of the order of a centimeter ( in the poloidal and toroidal direction ) and 10 ms @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity and precision in the radial direction , on the other hand , are dictated by the two lengthscales that need to be monitored and preserved .",
    "these are the distance between the lm surface and the last closed flux surface ( typically few cm ) and the lm thickness .",
    "the thickness can range from sub - millimeter to meters , depending whether the lm is only used for its benign plasma - facing properties ( low erosion , low recycling etc . ) or is also meant to attenuate heat and neutrons .",
    "all things considered , millimeter precision is expected to suffice in most cases .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we had shown that , quite simply , and on the net of small corrections , the electrical conductance between two electrodes immersed in the lm scales linearly with the local lm thickness .",
    "resistive measurements were used to infer the lm thickness in a single location and at a single time @xcite .    here , after briefly describing the experimental setup ( sec.[secsetup ] ) , we extend the measurements to multiple locations , requiring matricial formalism ( sec.[secspace ] ) , and to multiple times ( sec.[sectime ] ) .",
    "here we recapitulate an earlier description of the setup @xcite and report recent improvements .",
    "the setup features a container filled for 5 - 25 mm with a low melting point ( 10@xmath2c ) eutectic alloy of gallium , indium and tin called galinstan .",
    "this is about as good an electric conductor as lithium ( 17% and 16% of copper , respectively ) .",
    "embedded in the container are 3@xmath14 copper electrodes of 2 mm diameter and various lengths , for comparison ( 1 , 16 and 25 mm , each with its own advantages and disadvantages @xcite ) .",
    "adjacent electrodes are spaced by 25 mm in one direction and 15 mm in the other .",
    "the electrodes are connected to adjustable current - sources as well as to voltmeters referenced to ground .",
    "a shunt resistor is connected in series with the current - source , to measure the electrode current .",
    "as of recently , voltage and current signals are digitized at up to @xmath3 ksa / s and digitally filtered from high - frequency noise ( typically @xmath4500 hz ) .",
    "a labview interface analyzes these data and returns the electrical resistance and lm thickness between each pair of electrodes , in real time ( typically every 10 - 100 ms ) .",
    "consider @xmath0 electrodes , evenly spaced in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 direction , at distances @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , between adjacent electrodes . the electrodes are connected to individual power - supplies .",
    "these can inject or extract current in the lm , in the @xmath9 direction orthogonal to the @xmath10 plane",
    ". however , no charge is accumulated , and @xmath11=0 .",
    "that is , kirchhoff s law applies : the sum of all currents emitted or collected by an electrode is zero .",
    "the convention is adopted here that emitted currents are positive ; collected currents are negative . in general , there are five such currents for each electrode : four in the @xmath10 plane , pointing at adjacent electrodes , and one in the @xmath9 direction",
    ". boundary or corner electrodes , on the other hand , only connect to three or two adjacent electrodes and one power supply .",
    "currents can obviously flow from or to _ any _ other electrode , not necessarily adjacent .",
    "nonetheless , it is not necessary to model the system as a complicated network where all electrodes are directly connected to each other , forming a total of @xmath12 connections .",
    "instead , a cartesian grid of @xmath13 resistors suffices . in this representation ,",
    "each electrode is directly connected to only four adjacent electrodes via resistors , indicative of the lm thickness in between .",
    "currents can flow from one electrode to another along several different routes on this cartesian grid ; the total resistance between two remote electrodes can be calculated by repetead application of simple sum rules for resistors in series or parallel .",
    "the total resistance between adjacent electrodes , on the other hand is , with good approximation , that of the very resistor that directly connects them .",
    "let us call @xmath14 the current emitted by electrode @xmath15 and directed at the power supply .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the potential of electrode @xmath15 relative to some ground reference .",
    "the current emitted from electrode @xmath15 to electrode @xmath17 will be proportional to the electric field @xmath18 , to conductivity @xmath19 , and to the cross - sectional area @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the lm height in the midpoint between the two electrodes . after similar considerations for the other electrodes in the stencil ,",
    "kirchhoff s law writes : @xmath22    except for boundaries and corners of the domain , where one or two terms drop from the right hand side . in this equation , @xmath19 is fixed by the material , @xmath7 and @xmath8 by the geometry , currents and voltages are measured , and the heights are the unknowns .",
    "the substitution @xmath23 and similar ones were omitted for brevity . here",
    "the adoption of an harmonic mean instead of an arithmetic average is justified by the fact that the resistance between electrodes @xmath15 and @xmath17 is the sum of the resistances of the layers in between , which are inversely proportional to the local heights . also note that , by evaluating the heights in the mid - points between electrodes , rather than at the electrodes , there would be a total of @xmath13 unknown heights .",
    "eq.[eqfindiff ] describes a set of @xmath24 equations in @xmath24 unknowns @xmath25 .",
    "the problem can be cast in matricial form @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are one - dimensional arrays containing @xmath24 values of currents and heights , respectively .",
    "the block - diagonal matrix @xmath29 is large , but features only five non - vanishing elements in each row ( or four , or three , in rows corresponding to boundaries or corners ) , easily deduced from eq.[eqfindiff ] .",
    "ultimately we can solve for the lm heights by a simple matrix inversion , @xmath30 .",
    "it should be noted that ohm s law @xmath31 was used in eq.[eqfindiff ] , instead of the more general @xmath32 .",
    "this is legitimate under the assumptions that : ( 1 ) the liquid wall is thin and not significantly bulging or depleting ( @xmath33 ) and ( 2 ) there is no error field orthogonal to the wall ( @xmath340 ) . under these assumptions",
    ", @xmath35 has no @xmath5 nor @xmath6 components , hence it can not perturb the currents between electrodes .",
    "an alternative requirement is that ( 3 ) the flow is slow enough that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 components of @xmath35 are negligible compared with the corresponding components of @xmath36 .",
    "a realistic system violates these assumptions , and eq.[eqfindiff ] needs to be generalized : @xmath37 h_{i , j+\\frac{1}{2 } } dx \\\\    + & \\left [ \\frac{v_{i , j}-v_{i , j-1}}{dy } -(v_xb_z - v_zb_x)_{i , j-\\frac{1}{2 } }       \\right ] h_{i , j-\\frac{1}{2 } } dx \\\\    + & \\left [ \\frac{v_{i , j}-v_{i+1,j}}{dx } + ( v_zb_y - v_yb_z)_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j }       \\right ] h_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j } dy \\\\    + & \\left [ \\frac{v_{i , j}-v_{i-1,j}}{dx } -(v_zb_y - v_yb_z)_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j }         \\right ] h_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j } dy .",
    "\\label{eqfindiffb } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    this requires knowledge of the components of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the midpoints between electrodes",
    ". such knowledge could be provided by separate diagnostics , assumptions or calculations , or @xmath38 and @xmath39 might be reasonably fixed in the experiment . with this external input to matrix @xmath29 ,",
    "the problem can be solved as a simple matrix inversion again , @xmath40 .     and @xmath41 resistively measured versus @xmath42 measured by a teflon coated ruler , c ) scheme of the sensor , with the applied current and resistance measurement and d ) experimental setup.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      three 1 mm tall copper electrodes ( one column of the @xmath43 matrix ) were used for space - resolved measurements .",
    "the dc current generator is connected to the first and the last electrodes in the row ( fig .",
    "[ three_electrodes_test ] ) .",
    "the lm thickness between electrodes e2 and e3 is varied by inserting a non - conducting cube in the space over and between these electrodes .",
    "heights @xmath41 and @xmath42 were measured simultaneously by the resistive sensors , using eq.[eqfindiff ] for @xmath44=3 and @xmath45=1 .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ three_electrodes_test ] .",
    "the sensor is more accurate when measuring lower @xmath41 values .",
    "this is reasonable , since by increasing the lm height , the current between the short electrodes is not uniformly distributed , which decreases the accuracy of the theoretical model .",
    "another test was accomplished with the same setup , where this time the lm thickness was varied by tilting the entire lm pot .",
    "a difficulty was observed when resistively measuring the increase of @xmath41 .",
    "the sensor was not able to follow the increase , while it was correctly measuring the decrease in @xmath42 .",
    "the specular issue occurred when tilting to the opposite direction .",
    "voltages at and currents between @xmath46 electrodes were digitized at @xmath3 ksa / s and analyzed with eq.[eqfindiff ] .",
    "this provided space- and time - resolved information on lm thickness , as this was being periodically perturbed by a platform shaker oscillating by @xmath4710 mm at 0 - 3.3 hz .",
    "the introduction of these flows was important because lm walls will flow in a reactor , and be subject to secondary flows due to instabilities , turbulence and other effects @xcite .",
    "the method presented is general with respect to the type of flow .",
    "the only issue was that currents had to cross thick , short pieces of a good conductor ( galinstan ) .",
    "the resistances of interest were therefore small , the voltage signals were also small , and the signal - to - noise ratio relatively low . still , despite noise , it was possible to achieve the desired precision of 1 mm and exceed the desired time - resolution (  instead of 10 ms ) , as illustrated by fig.[timeresol ] .",
    "higher precisions are obviously achievable for coarser time resolutions .",
    "note that , due to the finite width of the container , shallow liquid metal and large oscillatory motion , the surface waves excited in the lm were highly non - linear .",
    "therefore , it was not surprising that , while periodic , the time - traces in fig.[timeresol ] were not pure sine - waves .",
    "fast camera images confirmed the non - linear behavior and agreed on the existence of `` steps '' ( fig.[timeresol ] ) .    1 copper , 1 mm tall electrodes . the sensor container , including 4 mm deep of galinstan is linearly moving in the horizontal direction at 72 rpm .",
    "a ) , b ) and c ) show the lm sensor at three different time steps corresponding to the points indicated on the measurement graph ( d ) and e ) is the shaker position . @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to the heights measured by the left and right sensors.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "resistive measurements of liquid metal thickness were spatially and temporally resolved for the first time .",
    "a theory was developed for @xmath0 electrodes and experimentally demonstrated for 3@xmath11 electrodes .",
    "measurements were carried out with galinstan in the absence of plasma , but are expected to succeed also with lithium , whose conductivity is nearly identical .    future work will be carried out in the presence of plasma .",
    "the diagnostic of thickness might require information from flowmeters and magnetics , due to complications associated with error fields and rapid flows , theoretically discussed in sec.[secspace ] ."
