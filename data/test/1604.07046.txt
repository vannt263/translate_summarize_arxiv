    "this is a widespread observation in nature with many interdisciplinary applications ranging from biology to physics .",
    "elucidating the key processes yielding to macroscopically ordered patterns is hence a fascinating field of investigations , at the forefront of many exciting developments .",
    "the mathematics that underlies patterns formation focuses on the dynamical interplay between reaction and diffusion processes .",
    "irrespectively of the specific domain of applications , elementary constituents can be ideally grouped in distinct species , family of homologous interacting units .",
    "usually , reaction - diffusion models are defined on a regular lattice , either continuous or discrete . in many cases of interest , it is however more natural to place the system on a network , bearing a complex structure",
    ". patterns for multi - species reaction - diffusion systems defined on complex networks materialise in a spontaneous differentiation between activator(inhibitor)-rich and activator(inhibitor)-poor nodes  @xcite .",
    "directed coupling can further seed topologically driven patterns , for a choice of the reaction parameters for which the trivial homogenous solution proves stable  @xcite .",
    "single individual effects are also crucial and significantly modify the idealised mean - field predictions : the stochastic component of the microscopic dynamics resulting from the inherent discreteness of the system , can in fact induce regular macroscopic patterns , both in time and space  @xcite .",
    "self - organisation may however proceed across interlinked networks , by exploiting the multifaceted nature of resources and organisational skills . to account for the hierarchical organisation in multiple nested layers , networks of networks",
    "can be also considered .",
    "these concepts are particularly relevant to transportation systems  @xcite , the learning process in the brain  @xcite and to understanding the emergent dynamics in ecology and social communities in general  @xcite .",
    "the process of pattern formation for a generalised reaction - diffusion scheme hosted on multiplex has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "depending on the cooperative interference between adjacent layers , stratified patterns can emerge also when the deterministic instability on each individual layer is impeded .",
    "conversely , patterns may dissolve by properly tuning the degree of interlayer overlap .",
    "diffusion - induced instability have been also studied for reaction systems defined on multi - graphs , graphs decorated with multiple links between pairs of nodes  @xcite , and shown to bear peculiar traits  @xcite . in all considered cases , the topology of the spatial support impacts on the ability of the systems to yield macroscopically organised patterns .",
    "the aim of this paper is to expand on these ideas , bridging the frameworks discussed in  @xcite and providing further evidence on the key role played by topology in shaping the system response to an external perturbation . more specifically , we will focus on the simplified setting where just two alternative sets of links are assumed to connect the available nodes .",
    "each species can diffuse from one node to the other , engaging only one of the two distinct transportation layers .",
    "these latter are characterised in terms of their associated ( weighted ) adjacency matrices , which depend parametrically on a scalar quantity @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath1 the two graphs are identical . at variance , for @xmath2 , the graphs are independent complex networks generated via an assigned recipe . by continuously increasing @xmath0 , within the allowed interval of definition",
    ", one can access intermediate configurations .",
    "as we shall make clear in the following , the amount of disorder imposed at the scale of individual layers ( and , consequently , their respective degree of diversity ) can be modulated to effectively control the large scale dynamics of the scrutinised system .",
    "disorder and diversity , as encoded in the scalar factor @xmath0 , can make the patterns to emerge or , alternatively , fade away .",
    "analytical estimates for the critical @xmath0 are obtained by perturbatively characterising the spectrum of the multi - dimensional matrix that governs the linear dynamics of the system , close to the homogeneous solution .",
    "patterns obtained for increasing @xmath0 appear to progressively localise  @xcite on a subset of nodes , a phenomenon that eventually reflects the topological characteristics of the dominant eigenmode .",
    "in the second part of the paper , we consider an alternative formulation of the problem .",
    "the graphs that define the layers of the multigraph differ now by a single undirected edge , with given weight @xmath3 . by tuning @xmath3 ,",
    "one can control the onset of the instability , as we shall prove analytically .",
    "different topological controllers that act on the structural parameters of hosting network ( nodes and edges ) , and their associated characteristics ( weights ) , can be hence devised which interfere with the inherent ability of the system to self - organise in macroscopically ordered patterns .",
    "it is the heterogenous nature of the spatial support , and the non trivial coupling between adjacent layers , which instigate ( or deter ) the instability , an observation that can be in turn exploited to alter the fate of the system , without touching at its internal reactive dynamics , and thus providing a control strategy  @xcite for the onset or disruption of macroscopic patterns on complex networks .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the next section the mathematical formalism is presented .",
    "in particular , we carry out a perturbative study of the spectrum of the multi - dimensional jacobian matrix which governs the evolution of the perturbation , under the linear approximation .",
    "the issue of pattern localisation is also discussed . in section 3",
    ", we make the two layers of the multi - graph distinct through insertion of a single additional link and provide analytical formulae to quantify its impact on the overall dispersion relation .",
    "the weight of the introduced link serves as a small parameter in carrying out a perturbative expansion .",
    "finally , we sum up and conclude .",

    "<S> two different cases study are considered : on the one side , we produce a global modification of the networks , starting from the limiting setting where species are hosted on the same graph . on the other </S>",
