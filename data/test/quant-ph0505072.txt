    "they are naturally used to model quantum computers : the two states of a spin-1/2 particle correspond to the two levels of a qubit and the exchange interaction corresponds to the qubit - qubit interaction .",
    "we focus here on a spin chain described by the @xmath0 model , where two different kinds of interaction are identified : the ising part , proportional to the anisotropy coupling , and the xy part , which can be used to create entanglement between two or more qubits @xcite .    in principle",

    "the model is described in the next section .",
    "section 3 discusses how defects can be used to create bell and @xmath1 states when the system contains just one excited qubit .",
    "once the desired state is generated , we outline a way to preserve it with high fidelity for a long time , which requires quickly detuning the defects involved in the process .",

    "all qubits have the same level spacing @xmath24 , while a disordered system has at least one site with a different energy @xmath25 , which is called a defect . in principle , complete control of the qubit level spacings is available , which allows the ` creation of defects ' .",

    ", we guarantee that states with one excitation on a defect do not couple with states that have the excitation on the other sites . in terms of energy spectra",
    ", we form two well separated bands .",
    "it is then possible to treat the spin chain as two smaller and decoupled chains .",
    "let us first examine the case where there are simply two defects with @xmath47 , placed on sites @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the chain is broken into two , one with @xmath50 qubits , whose state energies lie within the band @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , and the other with just two qubits , whose eigenstates are bell states and have energies @xmath53 .",
    "an excitation created on one defect will hop between the two defects with a frequency determined by their distance . to find this value , we need to compute the energies @xmath54 of the two eigenstates @xmath55 $ ] of the defect chain .",

    "we diagonalize a 2x2 submatrix whose diagonal elements are @xmath57 and off - diagonal elements give the effective hopping integral @xmath58 , so @xmath59 . if the defects are next - nearest neighbors , @xmath48 and @xmath60 , they are coupled to second order of perturbation theory .",
    "now the diagonal elements are @xmath61 and the off - diagonal elements are @xmath62 , leading to states with much closer energies @xmath63 .",
    "the larger the separation between the defects , the closer will be the energies of the two eigenstates .",
    "an excitation initially prepared on site @xmath48 will have probability    @xmath64}{2 } , \\label{t1}\\ ] ]    to be later found on the same site .",
    "the oscillation period of the excitation between the defects is inversely proportional to the energy difference of the two eigenstates .",
    "it therefore depends on the number @xmath65 of sites between the defects as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "bell states are created when @xmath68 , that is , at every instant @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath43 is an odd number .",
    "the more separated are the defects the longer is the wait for a maximally entangled state to be created , but in principle we can entangle even remote qubits .",
    "once the desired state has been generated , the two defects should be detuned for the state to be maintained unchanged . a scheme for a possible detuning procedure is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "the level spacing of one qubit is kept constant , while the other increases according to a certain function of time @xmath70 , which depends on the experimental setting and on the fidelity we want to attain . at the end of the process",
    ", the energy difference between the two defects should be much larger than their effective hopping integral .     and",

    "here we briefly comment on how two of them , concurrence @xcite and global entanglement @xcite , can be affected by defects .",
    "they both vary from 0 ( unentangled state ) to 1 ( entangled state ) , but concurrence is a measure of bipartite entanglement , while the other is able to quantify multipartite entanglement .",
    "it is straightforward to conceive a system where all eigenvectors are bell states and therefore have maximum individual ( as well as the average over all states ) concurrence .",
    "an example is a chain with an even number of qubits @xmath10 , where pairs of sites have the same level spacings , but differ from the others by more than the coupling strength between them . in this situation ,",
    "all eigenvectors are bell states each involving a particular pair of resonant sites . in terms of multipartite entanglement , designing a distribution of defects that would lead to large global entanglement is in general more demanding .",
    "the definition of global entanglement is @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the reduced density matrix for qubit @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "for the example described , it is maximum only for a two - qubit chain , decreasing with the chain size as @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , systems described by the @xmath0 model may not be ideal , because states that are known to have large global entanglement , such as the @xmath82 or products of bell states , can not be created .",
    "this is a consequence of the conservation of the total spin in the @xmath13 direction , which prevents the coupling between basis states that have a different number of excitations .      to create a @xmath1 state with one excitation ,",
    "three defects are necessary .",
    "the procedure is very similar to the one described before .",
    "let us assume three nearest neighbor defects , @xmath48 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "the three eigenvectors of the defect chain are a good approximation to the actual corresponding vectors obtained with the total hamiltonian .",

    "a possible detuning procedure for the defects for @xmath93 is the following : the level spacing of defect @xmath89 is kept fixed , while the level spacings of @xmath48 and @xmath49 increase in time according to the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the process is given by    @xmath96    for the three defects to become out of resonance , we can use for instance , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
