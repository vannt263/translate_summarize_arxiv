    "gravity in higher dimensions has been in the forefront of research for a considerable time .",
    "most of the studies start with the conventional einstein action generalized to @xmath7 dimensions . in the low energy limit",
    "quantum theories of gravity like string theory yield additional higher order curvature correction terms to the einstein action.@xcite some higher order curvature terms when taken in isolation and quantized can potentially lead to problematic high energy behavior , such as the presence of negative norm states .",
    "the simplest term avoiding these problems is the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term . in this letter",
    "we analyze the critical behavior of a class of classical solutions to einstein gravity , augmented by the gb term .",
    "such a term arises in the gravity action in string theory when corrections to zero slope limit are calculated  @xcite  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we restrict our discussion to five space - time dimension , but as we will point out later the results can be simply generalized to higher dimensions .    in einstein gravity @xmath8 solutions , like a black hole",
    "can be trivially extended to a black string ( @xmath9 ) or black brane solutions ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "solutions become more complicated if higher derivative terms are added to the einstein action , such as the gb term .",
    "though asymptotically minkowski black _ hole _ solutions have been found in @xmath11 theories  @xcite , no exact black string ( brane ) solutions are known in egb gravity .",
    "yet the investigations of black strings ( branes ) is more important because with compact extra dimensions all but the lightest static objects must be black strings ( branes ) .",
    "two alternative techniques have been used to investigate black brane solutions .",
    "kobayashi and tanaka  @xcite solved the 5 dimensional einstein equations modified by the lanczos tensor ( variation of the gauss - bonnet term ) , numerically .",
    "using an expansion around the event horizon they also found an exact lower bound for the black string mass , @xmath12 , where @xmath0 is the coupling constant of the gb term .",
    "for @xmath13 the solutions do not have a horizon , they represent naked singularities .    in a subsequent work  @xcite ,",
    "following  @xcite , we used a series expansion in @xmath0 to investigate black strings in @xmath10 egb theory .",
    "we found that in every dimension , @xmath14 , a lower bound , similar to that in @xmath9 , exists for the mass of the black string .",
    "we also investigated the thermodynamics of the black string but the fifth order expansion employed in our paper was insufficient to get a definitive answer for the thermal behavior of the system when the mass of the black string approached the lower limit .    in this paper",
    "we also use improved numerical and expansion methods to investigate black string solutions including the neighborhood of critical points , @xmath15 and 3 , where the dimensionless gb coupling is defined as @xmath16 in ( [ beta ] ) @xmath5 denotes the radius of the horizon .",
    "@xmath17 determines the critical radius .",
    "the critical radius has a one - to - one relationship with the critical mass , which is determined by the condition @xmath18 .    in section 2",
    "we will discuss the uniform black string , which should have a higher entropy than a black hole , when the mass is large enough .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently high mass it is the only static state of the system .",
    "we will use a horizon expansion to elucidate the nature of two critical points @xmath6 and 3 .",
    "we will concentrate on @xmath9 but , except for numerical details @xmath19 theories are not different .",
    "then we will use numerical calculations to investigate the properties of black string at large distances from the horizon .",
    "we discuss their thermodynamics and calculate their entropy .",
    "in section 3 we will investigate the extension of the gregory - laflamme instability  @xcite and the notion of the non - uniform black string , which is the preferred state if the radius of horizon goes under a critical multiple of the radius of compactification  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "we will also plot the phase diagram of black strings in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "section 4 . summarizes our results .",
    "we will also discuss the possible directions for the continuation of this research .",
    "in this section we will discuss the extension of a 4-dimensional solution to @xmath21 .",
    "if we assume that the metric @xmath22 is an asymptotically flat solution of the 4 dimensional einstein equation then the trivial extension of this metric , obtained by defining @xmath23 and @xmath24 satisfies the @xmath21 dimensional einstein equation . here , and in what follows , @xmath25 .",
    "we tacitly assume that the coordinates , labeled by @xmath26 are compactified on circles , in which space we will maintain a @xmath27 symmetry throughout this paper . however , the trivially extended metric is not the solution of einstein - gauss - bonnet equation @xmath28 where @xmath0 is the coupling , the lanczos tensor is @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the kretschmann scalar , @xmath31    in an appropriate coordinate system the metric components of uniform black brane solutions depend only on a radial coordinate .",
    "nonuniform black branes and the gregory - laflamme instability will be discussed later .",
    "the metric of nonuniform black branes is a periodic function of the compactified coordinate , @xmath32 , as well .      throughout this paper",
    "we will use dimensionless coordinates , scaled by the radius of the horizon , @xmath5 , of the uniform black string .",
    "in particular , we choose the horizon variable , @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 to replace the radial coordinate , @xmath35 .",
    "when the gb coupling , @xmath0 , is also rescaled , by the introduction of the parameter , @xmath36 ( see eq . [ beta ] ) , then all reference to the radius of the horizon is eliminated from the equations of motion .",
    "the only parameter remaining in the equations of motion is @xmath36 .",
    "true values of physical quantities are restored by multiplying by a power of @xmath5 , required by their dimensions .    defining the metric of a uniform string , made dimensionless by factoring out @xmath37 , as @xmath38 we can solve the equations of motion in a power series of @xmath33 ( horizon expansion ) .",
    "the series coefficients depend only on @xmath36 . displaying three leading orders only , the expansions have the following form : @xmath39 the two constants , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , are not determined by the horizon expansion alone .",
    "they depend on @xmath36 only .",
    "they must be introduced in @xmath42 and @xmath43 to assure that the metric components are asymptotically minkowski .",
    "they are determined in the process of numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "the expansion coefficients have two singular points : @xmath6 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that for @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "the physical domain is @xmath47 .",
    "the expansion coefficients are complex for @xmath48 and there are singularities outside the horizon for @xmath49 .",
    "questions have been raised whether negative values of @xmath0 are admissible  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for completeness we will also investigate that region , as well .",
    "near the singular points the convergence radius of the expansion shrinks to zero .",
    "the leading singular terms of the expansion coefficients ( subscript @xmath50 implies the coefficient of @xmath51 ) are the following : @xmath52    since the expansion coefficients become complex at @xmath48 the solution does not exist for negative @xmath36 , contradicting the assumption of the existence of a horizon or / and a regular expansion around the horizon  @xcite .",
    "this result can , however , be the result of a poor choice of the coordinates .",
    "therefore , we also calculate scalars , like the ricci scalar ( @xmath53 ) and the kretschmann scalar ( @xmath30 ) , at the horizon . being scalars , they must be independent of the scaling factors @xmath40 or @xmath41 which can be gauged away by rescaling the coordinates @xmath54 or @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , we obtain @xmath55 we can draw several conclusions from ( [ scalars ] ) .",
    "first of all , @xmath53 and @xmath30 are non - analytic at @xmath6 and 3 , ruling out mere coordinate singularities .",
    "furthermore , both of these constants become complex for @xmath48 , therefore no uniform black string solution with regular horizon can exist in that region .",
    "@xmath48 implies @xmath56 and , as we will see later , @xmath5 , though not quite proportional , but is a regular and bounded function of the adm mass .",
    "thus , the @xmath18 bound imposes a lower limit on the mass of the black string .",
    "furthermore , while all curvature invariants are finite at @xmath6 they are infinite at @xmath44 .",
    "this points to the possibility of the existence of a critical solution at @xmath6 but not at @xmath44 . we will discuss the @xmath6 critical solution in the following section .      to investigate the critical solution we start with a rearrangement of the horizon expansion series",
    "keeping only the leading singular terms in every order of @xmath33 we are lead to functions of a scaling variable @xmath57 .",
    "thus , one can define alternative expansions in series of scaling functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the scaling expansion is defined as @xmath60\\right\\ } , \\label{expansion2}\\ ] ] with similar expressions for @xmath61 and @xmath43 in terms of series of scaling functions , @xmath62 and @xmath59 . substituting ( [ expansion2 ] ) into ( [ egb ] )",
    "we obtain differential equations for the scaling functions defined in ( [ expansion2 ] ) .",
    "the equation for @xmath63 is @xmath64\\phi_1''+27y^4(\\phi_1')^2 + 6y^2(12y\\phi_1 - 5)\\phi_1'+2(18y2\\phi_1 ^ 2 - 12y\\phi_1 - 7y)=0 , \\label{phi1eq}\\ ] ] while @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be simply expressed by @xmath63 as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "though we could not find the solution of ( [ phi1eq ] ) in analytic form the general behavior of @xmath63 can be analyzed fairly easily .",
    "its power series in @xmath69 is provided by the most singular terms of horizon expansion ( [ horizon1 ] ) . analyzing an 80th order series expansion",
    "we were able to ascertain that @xmath63 has a singularity inside the horizon of the form @xmath70 eq .",
    "( [ singularity ] ) suggests that the metric becomes singular inside the horizon , at @xmath71 and can not be continued to smaller values of @xmath33 . note that this singularity moves to @xmath72 at @xmath6",
    ". we will indeed see below that the critical solution is singular at @xmath72 and can not be continued to @xmath73 .",
    "there is no impediment , however to continue @xmath63 to positive values .",
    "in fact the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ phi1eq ] ) shows that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath63 is @xmath74 numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ phi1eq ] ) shows that for a function with the series expansion implied by ( [ horizon1 ] ) the positive sign should be chosen in ( [ asymptotic3 ] ) .",
    "now in the @xmath75 limit the first terms of ( [ expansion2 ] ) become @xmath76\\right\\}=\\rho\\left \\{1+\\sqrt{\\rho}\\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{\\frac{7}{3}}+ ... ]\\right\\ } \\label{expansion3}\\ ] ] the @xmath75 limit of higher order expansion terms lead to higher powers of @xmath33 , including all half - integer powers .",
    "this can be ascertained by repeating the horizon expansion ( [ horizon1 ] ) with half - integer powers included ( starting from @xmath77 ) .",
    "this leads to the following expansion of the critical black string ( @xmath6 ) solution : @xmath78 if one attempts an expansion with half - integer powers of @xmath33 for general @xmath36 then either all the half - integer powers vanish or @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , no horizon expansion with integer powers exists for the critical black string .",
    "the value of scalars @xmath53 and @xmath30 can also be calculated at @xmath72 using ( [ critical ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath79 and @xmath80 , precisely the values obtained from the @xmath6 limit of ( [ scalars ] ) .",
    "in fact , one can show that all scalars are finite in the critical state .",
    "correction to scalars , when one moves away from the horizon are of @xmath81 . further evidence for the fact that the critical string is the limit of non - critical strings when @xmath75 comes from numerical integration of the equations of motion , to be discussed later .",
    "the @xmath72 surface can not really be called a horizon , just the limit of horizons when @xmath75 .",
    "while it is an infinite red shift null surface , the metric can not be continued inside the @xmath72 surface .",
    "we believe that there is no way to facilitate such a continuation . strictly speaking , though this is a string solution , it is not `` black . ''",
    "it is however a limiting solution of a series of black string solutions in every quantity that we investigated .",
    "at all @xmath18 the horizon is completely regular and there is always a region inside the horizon , @xmath82 , where the solution can be continued without any impediment .",
    "time - like geodesics can be continued to the horizon both in the @xmath18 and @xmath6 cases .",
    "a test particle reaches the horizon in finite proper time , @xmath83 .",
    "however , while in the @xmath18 case the test particle passes through the horizon into a region from which it can not escape any more , for @xmath6 geodesics have a pathological behavior . choosing a geodesic for a particle falling towards the horizon , @xmath84 , and the time scale such that @xmath85 the radial coordinate turns complex for @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the role of the critical solution as a valid state of black strings is questionable .",
    "this question will be discussed later in more details , following the discussion of numerical integration of the equations of motion and of the gregory - laflamme instability .",
    "we build on the results of the previous sections to obtain the metric functions at arbitrary @xmath87 . before starting the numerical integration from the horizon",
    "we calculate the value of the metric functions and their derivatives from the horizon expansion at @xmath88 .",
    "this step is necessary because @xmath72 is a singular point of the differential equations .",
    "@xmath89 is chosen to be small enough so that the last terms of the 30th order horizon expansion is smaller than @xmath90 .",
    "then we integrate the equations numerically from @xmath91 using metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the step size , @xmath92 , in the numerical integration is chosen such that @xmath93 .",
    "expansions ( [ horizon1 ] ) contain undetermined constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in an initial run",
    "these constants are chosen to be 1 . then , though the calculated metric functions tend to a finite value as @xmath94 , their asymptotic limit is not 1 .",
    "fitting a form @xmath95 to @xmath42 , and a similar form to @xmath43 we define @xmath96 and @xmath97 to get , after a second round of numerical integrations , metric functions that are asymptotically 1 , which corresponds to minkowski space",
    ".      the numerical form of the metric functions allows us to investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black string .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics states that  @xcite@xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the arnowit - deser - misner ( adm ) mass , @xmath100 is the hawking temperature of the black string , @xmath101 is the tension , and @xmath102 is circumference of the compact string .    the surface gravity on the horizon , @xmath50 , is related to the hawking temperature as follows  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite @xmath103 using ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ horizon1 ] ) we obtain @xmath104 where we restored the correct dimension of the surface gravity by reinstating a factor of @xmath105 . as we pointed out earlier @xmath106 and @xmath107 are determined in the process of numerical integration .",

    "in contrast to uniform black strings non - uniform black strings require the solution of a two variable problem .",
    "therefore , it is quite a bit more complicated to investigate the fate of _ non - unifom _ black strings . however",
    ", we can substantially simplify matters if we restrict ourselves to sufficiently small values of @xmath36 .",
    "though we can not quite follow non - uniform black strings through the region of instability , we assume that if @xmath132 they eventually also approach the @xmath6 line in the plot of fig.2 .",
    "of course , it is quite possible that nonuniform black strings also undergo an instability transition , before they could reach the critical state .",
    "still the following calculations , pertaining to the behavior of nonuniform stings near @xmath6 , certainly apply to a neighborhood of the critical point , @xmath6 , @xmath203 .",
    "the simplest way to proceed is to investigate the horizon expansion ( [ metric2 ] ) with @xmath32-dependent coefficients .",
    "we write the following ansatz for the metric @xmath204 note that the @xmath32 dependence can be gauged away from @xmath205 and from the zeroth order contribution to @xmath206 . expanding the equations of motion in @xmath33 ,",
    "the lowest order contribution to @xmath207 implies that the periodic function @xmath208 is independent of @xmath32 . in the next step one",
    "can solve the lowest order contributions to @xmath180 and @xmath182 equations for @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "then the lowest order contributions to equations @xmath179 and @xmath182 are identical .",
    "they are second order equations for @xmath211 , containing @xmath212 and its second derivative .",
    "solving the resulting equations for @xmath211 the discriminant of the equation must be positive for a real solution .",
    "this discriminant has the form @xmath213",
    "^ 4+(1-\\beta)^2[c_0'(w)]^4 - 8(1-\\beta)[c_0(w)]^3[2+c_0''(w)]-(1-\\beta)^2c_0(w)[c_0'(w)]^2[2 + 3c_0''(w)]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2(1-\\beta)[c_0(w)]^2\\left\\{4[c_0'(w)]^2+(1-\\beta)c_0''(w)[2+c_0''(w)]\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we know that for uniform black strings @xmath214 and for a small non - uniformity @xmath212 must have the form @xmath215 then expanding @xmath216 in @xmath172 and @xmath36 and keeping the leading order contributions only , we obtain @xmath217 . \\label{d2}\\ ] ] ( [ d2 ] ) implies that the discriminant is positive for all @xmath32 only if @xmath218 first of all ( [ final ] ) implies that @xmath219 when we approach the critical state , @xmath6 .",
    "this makes our approximation of expanding @xmath216 in @xmath172 correct for small @xmath36 .",
    "secondly , this implies that the non - uniform black string becomes a uniform black string again at the critical line .",
    "thirdly , this implies the line of first order gregory - laflamme transition to the non - uniform state ends in a second order transition point at @xmath6 . this is a well - known feature of first order transitions",
    "we have studied uniform and non - uniform black strings in @xmath9 egb gravity .",
    "we paid particular attention to the singularities at the endpoints of range , @xmath53 , @xmath3 , where @xmath36 is defined in ( [ beta ] ) .",
    "no black string solutions exists outside @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , we found a critical solution at @xmath6 which , in contrast to solutions at @xmath18 , has a horizon expansion that includes half - integer powers of the radial horizon variable , @xmath33 ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "not only the metric components , but all scalars , including the ricci scalar and the kretschmann scalar , are also singular ( though finite ) at @xmath6 ( [ scalars ] ) .    at @xmath18",
    "the metric components are singular inside the horizon , at @xmath220 ( [ singularity ] ) .",
    "it is always possible to continue the metric to a region inside the horizon .",
    "introducing eddington - fonkelstein coordinates @xmath221 the metric takes the form @xmath222 regular everywhere including a neighborhood of the horizon . on the interval @xmath223 for the whole range , @xmath53 , of admissible values of @xmath36 . ] the singularity at @xmath224 moves to the horizon when @xmath75 .",
    "we have not been able to construct a metric inside this singular point . at @xmath6",
    ", the critical metric can not be continued inside the horizon .",
    "this can be shown if near the horizon we transform the metric to kruskal coordinates .",
    "we define the kruskal coordinates for the critical string such that the coefficient of @xmath225 is @xmath226 .",
    "they can be obtained in a asymptotic expansion from the eddington - finkelstein coordinates @xmath227 and @xmath228 we obtain @xmath229dw^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 has the following expression by the kruskal coordinates @xmath230 and @xmath231 @xmath232 where @xmath233 is a non - vanishing constant .",
    "it is obvious we can not cross the light like surfaces @xmath234 or @xmath235 which represent the horizon .",
    "we also showed that a geodesic of a massive probe falling toward the horizon reaches it in finite proper time ( at @xmath236 ) , but it can not pass the horizon because its radial coordinate turns complex at @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the critical solution does not represent a black string .",
    "we used numerical techniques to calculate the solutions for the whole range @xmath53 .",
    "we calculated the adm mass , tension , hawking temperature , and entropy .",
    "these quantities are represented by form factors , depending on @xmath36 only , measuring the deviation from the @xmath160 ( @xmath125 ) , einstein gravity solutions .",
    "these form factors are defined in ( [ hawk1])([m])([tau])([entscale]).they are plotted in figs 1 . and 2 .",
    "while the hawking - temperature tends to a finite value at @xmath6 , it diverges at @xmath44 .",
    "the adm mass and tension are modified only by a finite amount compared to pure einstein gravity and bounded from above and below over the whole range , @xmath53 .",
    "we gave a closed expression for the entropy in terms of an integral over the form factors , which was evaluated .",
    "the entropy is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath36 , vanishing in the limit @xmath44 .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the divergence of the hawking temperature .",
    "we paid particular attention to the life line of black strings decaying via hawking radiation .",
    "we found that every black string follows a trajectory in the @xmath237 plane , approaching ( depending on the sign of @xmath0 ) one of the singular lines in the @xmath238-plane .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "3 . however , some of the black strings , depending whether @xmath239 , will encounter a line of first order singularities , which is the extension of the famed gregory - laflamme singularity .",
    "this line is the solid line shown in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "3 . under this line",
    "only non - uniform black string are stable .",
    "as we commented before , non - uniform black strings may become unstable at a subsequent phase transition line .",
    "finally , we showed , by investigating non - uniform string solutions near the horizon that the amplitude of non - uniformity vanishes near the @xmath6 line .",
    "this implies that non - uniform strings become uniform once again as they reach the @xmath6 line . as a corollary",
    ", we concluded that the line of first order phase transitions ends in a second order transition point at @xmath6 .",
    "there are two unresolved problems concerning the fate of black strings .",
    "if @xmath132 they are driven toward the critical state at @xmath6 .",
    "that state , however is very problematic .",
    "though @xmath205 has a linear zero and all scalars are finite at that zero , test particles that reach the @xmath72 point in finite time have nowhere to go . because the @xmath240 becomes complex as a function of proper time .    as finding solutions for black holes in compactified spaces is even more difficult than finding black string solutions we have no way of comparing the entropy and relative stability of these solutions .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we are not able to answer what happens with black strings that reach the end of their lives at the @xmath6 line . since the limit of their hawking temperature is @xmath241 not zero , as a study based on @xmath242 expansions lead us to believe earlier , so they are certainly not frozen at that point .",
    "their adm mass is ( [ m ] ) @xmath243 they can not go into a black string state with a smaller adm , mass , however , because such black string states do not exist .",
    "it seems that the only possibility is that some other , yet undiscovered , type of higher entropy static or possibly dynamic state exists , into which the black string can morph . another possible solution , at least for @xmath244 ,",
    "is that the inclusion of higher order lovelock terms would cure this anomaly .",
    "the fate of black stings at and beyond @xmath6 is one of the most important questions we would like to investigate in the future .",
    "other questions include a possible numerical study of black holes in compactified spaces .",
