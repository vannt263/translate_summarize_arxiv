    "relations between social actors can be studied by methods of social network analysis [ e.g. , wasserman and faust ( @xcite ) ; carrington , scott and wasserman ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "examples are friendship between pupils in a school class or alliances between firms .",
    "a basic data structure for social networks is the directed graph or digraph , where the actors are represented by the nodes , and the arcs between the nodes indicate the social ties . social network analysis traditionally has had a focus on rich description of network data , but the recent development of methods of statistical inference for network data [ e.g. , airoldi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; hunter and handcock ( @xcite ) ] has the potential of moving this field toward a wider use of inferential approaches .",
    "longitudinal studies are especially important for obtaining insight into social networks , but statistical methods for longitudinal network data that are versatile enough for realistic modeling are only just beginning to be developed .",
    "this article considers repeated observations of a relation , or network , on a given set of actors @xmath0 , observed according to a panel design , and represented as a sequence of digraphs @xmath1 for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 are the observation moments .",
    "the  nodes represent social actors ( which may be individuals , companies , etc . ) , and the node set @xmath4 is the same for all observation moments .",
    "a digraph is defined here as an irreflexive relation , that is , a subset @xmath5 of @xmath6 , and when @xmath7 we shall say that there is an arc , or a tie , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "it often is realistic to assume that the social network has been developing between the observation moments , which leads to the assumption that the observations @xmath1 are realizations of stochastic digraphs @xmath10 embedded in a continuous - time stochastic process @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "holland and leinhardt ( @xcite ) proposed to use continuous - time markov chains , defined on the space of all digraphs with a given node set , for modeling social network dynamics even if the observations are made at a few discrete time points and not continuously .",
    "continuous - time markov chains provide a natural starting point for modeling longitudinal network data .",
    "wasserman ( @xcite , @xcite ) and leenders ( @xcite ) elaborated _ dyad - independent models _",
    ", where the ties between pairs of actors ( _ dyads _ ) develop according to processes that are mutually independent between dyads .",
    "this is not realistic for social processes , because dependence between the set of ties among three or more actors can be very strong , as was found already by davis ( @xcite ) who showed that a basic feature of many social networks is the tendency toward transitivity ( `` friends of my friends are my friends '' ) .",
    "snijders and van duijn ( @xcite ) and snijders ( @xcite ) proposed so - called _ actor - oriented models _",
    ", explained in the next section , which do allow such higher - order dependencies .",
    "the  actor - oriented models are too complicated for the calculation of likelihoods or estimators in closed form , but they represent stochastic processes which can be easily simulated .",
    "this was exploited by the estimation method proposed in the papers mentioned , which is a method of moments ( _ mom _ ) estimator implemented algorithmically by stochastic approximation [ robbins and monro ( @xcite ) ; also see , e.g. , kushner and yin ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "this estimator usually performs well [ some empirical applications are given in de federico ( @xcite ) , van de bunt , van duijn and snijders ( @xcite ) , and van duijn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] .",
    "it is to be expected , however , that the statistical efficiency of the maximum likelihood ( _ ml _ ) estimator will be greater .",
    "ml estimation also paves the way for likelihood - based model selection , which will be a marked improvement on existing methods of model selection .",
    "this article presents an mcmc algorithm for approximating the ml estimator , combining and extending ideas in gu and kong ( @xcite ) , snijders ( @xcite ) , and koskinen and snijders ( @xcite ) , the latter of which proposed for this model a mcmc algorithm for bayesian inference .",
    "section [ sec2 ] presents the model definition . the  algorithm for obtaining the ml estimator",
    "is described in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "section [ sec4 ] reports results of an empirical example and section [ sec5 ] presents a very small simulation study comparing the ml and mom estimators .",
    "the  paper finishes with an algorithm for approximating the likelihood ratio test in section [ sec6 ] and a discussion in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "we assume that repeated observations @xmath13 on the network are available for some @xmath14 . the  network , or digraph , @xmath5 will be identified with its @xmath15 adjacency matrix , of which the elements denote whether there is a tie from node @xmath8 to node @xmath9 ( @xmath16 ) or not ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "self - ties are not allowed , so that the diagonal is structurally zero .",
    "random variables are denoted by capitals . the  stochastic process @xmath11 , in which the observations @xmath1 are embedded , is modeled as being right - continuous .",
    "various models have been proposed , most of them being markov processes of some kind .",
    "we focus on actor - oriented models [ snijders ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "tie - oriented models [ snijders ( @xcite ) ] can be treated similarly .",
    "the  basic idea of actor - oriented models [ snijders ( @xcite ) ] is that the nodes of the graph represent social actors , who have control , albeit under constraints , of their outgoing ties ; and the graph develops as a continuous - time markov process ( even though it is observed only at @xmath18 discrete time points ) .",
    "the  constraints are that ties may change only one by one , and actors do not coordinate their changes of ties .",
    "thus , at any given moment , one actor @xmath8 may create one new tie or delete one existing tie , where the probability distribution of such changes depends on the current digraph ; excluded are simultaneous changes such as swapping one tie for another , or bargaining between actors over ties .",
    "this constraint was proposed already by holland and leinhardt ( @xcite ) , and it has the virtue of splitting up the change process in its smallest possible constituents .",
    "the  actor - oriented model is further specified as follows ; further discussion and motivation is given in snijders ( @xcite ) .    1 .",
    "_ opportunities for change _",
    "each actor @xmath8 gets at stochastically determined moments the opportunity to change one of the outgoing tie variables @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "since the process is assumed to be markovian , waiting times between opportunities have exponential distributions .",
    "each of the actors @xmath8 has a _ rate function _",
    "@xmath22 which defines how quickly this actor gets an opportunity to change a tie variable , when the current value of the digraph is @xmath5 , and where @xmath23 is a parameter . at any time point @xmath24 with @xmath25 , the waiting time until the next opportunity for change by any actor",
    "is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath26 given that an opportunity for change occurs , the probability that it is actor @xmath8 who gets the opportunity is given by @xmath27 the  rate functions can be constant between observation moments , or they can depend on functions @xmath28 which may be covariates or positional characteristics of the actors such as outdegrees @xmath29 .",
    "a convenient assumption is to use an exponential link function , @xmath30    1 .",
    "_ options for change _    when actor @xmath8 gets the opportunity to make a change , this actor has a permitted set @xmath31 of values to which the digraph may be changed , where @xmath32 is the current value of the digraph .",
    "the  assumption that the actor controls his or her outgoing ties , but can change only one tie variable at the time , is equivalent to    [ ai ] @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the set of adjacency matrices differing from @xmath5 in exactly one element , @xmath35\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\hspace*{14pt}\\mbox { and } x_{hk } = x^0_{hk } \\mbox { for all other } ( h , k ) \\ } .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    including @xmath32 in @xmath31 can be important for expressing the property that actors who are satisfied with the current network will prefer to keep it unchanged .",
    "therefore , the usual model is @xmath36 .",
    "this does not lead to identifiability problems because the ratio between not making a change and making a change is not a free parameter , but fixed by assumption ( [ choiceprob ] ) for the conditional probabilities of the new state of the network .",
    "some alternatives are models with structurally impossible ties , where the impossible digraphs are left out of @xmath31 , and models where the actor is required to make a change whenever there is the opportunity , obtained by leaving the current element @xmath32 out of @xmath31 .",
    "it is assumed that the network dynamics is driven by a so - called _ objective function _ @xmath37 that can be interpreted as the relative attractiveness for actor @xmath8 of moving from the network represented by @xmath32 to the network @xmath5 , and where @xmath38 is a parameter . under the condition",
    "that the current digraph is @xmath32 and actor @xmath8 gets the opportunity to make a change , the conditional probability that the next digraph is  @xmath5  is modeled as @xmath39 where the summation extends over @xmath40 .",
    "this formula can be motivated by a random utility argument as used in econometrics [ see , e.g. , maddala ( @xcite ) ] , where it is assumed that the actor maximizes @xmath37 plus a random disturbance having a standard gumbel distribution . assumption ( [ ai ] ) implies that instead of @xmath41 we can also write @xmath42 where the correspondence between @xmath5 and @xmath9 is defined as follows : if @xmath43 , @xmath9 is the unique element of @xmath4 for which @xmath44 ; if @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "this less redundant notation will be used in the sequel . thus , for @xmath21",
    ", @xmath42 is the probability that , under the condition that actor  @xmath8 has the opportunity to make a change and the current digraph is @xmath32 , the change will be to @xmath47 with the rest unchanged , while @xmath48 is the probability that , under the same condition , the digraph will not be changed .",
    "the  most usual models are based on objective functions that depend on @xmath5 only .",
    "this has the interpretation that actors wish to maximize a function @xmath49 independently of `` where they come from . ''",
    "the  greater generality of ( [ choiceprob ] ) , where the objective function can depend also on the previous state @xmath32 , makes it possible to model path - dependencies , or hysteresis , where the loss suffered from withdrawing a given tie differs from the gain from creating this tie , even if the rest of the network has remained unchanged .    various ingredients for specifying the objective function were proposed in snijders ( @xcite ) .",
    "a linear form is convenient , @xmath50 where the functions @xmath51 are determined by subject - matter knowledge and available social scientific theory .",
    "these functions can represent essential aspects of the network structure , assessed from the point of view of actor @xmath8 , such as @xmath52 they can also depend on covariates  such as resources and preferences of the actors , or costs of exchange between pairs of actors  or combinations of network structure and covariates .",
    "for example , de federico ( @xcite ) found in a study of friendship between foreign exchange students that friendship formation tends to be reciprocal , with a negative parameter for forming indirect ties ( thus leading to relatively closed networks ) , and that friendships are more likely to be formed between individuals from the same region ( a covariate effect ) , but that reciprocation adds less to the tendency to form ties between persons from the same region than between arbitrary individuals ( negative interaction between covariate and reciprocity ) .    1 .   _ intensity matrix ; time - homogeneity _",
    "the  model description given above defines @xmath11 as a continuous - time markov process with @xmath53-matrix or intensity matrix [ e.g. , norris ( @xcite ) ] for @xmath43 given by @xmath54 the  assumptions do not imply that the distribution of @xmath11 is stationary .",
    "the  intensity matrix is time - homogeneous , however , except for time dependence reflected by time - varying components in the functions @xmath51 .    for the data - collection designs to which this paper is devoted , where observations are done at discrete time points @xmath55 , these time points can be used for marking time - heterogeneity of the transition distribution ( cf .",
    "the example in section  [ sec6 ] ) .",
    "for example , covariates may be included with values allowed to change at the observation moments .",
    "a special role is played here by the time durations @xmath56 between successive observations .",
    "standard theory for continuous - time markov chains [ e.g. , norris ( @xcite ) ] shows that the matrix of transition probabilities from @xmath10 to @xmath57 is @xmath58 , where @xmath53 is the matrix with elements  ( [ q ] ) .",
    "thus , changing the duration @xmath56 can be compensated by multiplication of the rate function @xmath59 by a constant .",
    "since the connection between an externally defined real - valued time variable @xmath60 and the rapidity of network change is tenuous at best , it usually is advisable [ e.g. , see snijders ( @xcite ) ] to include a multiplicative parameter in the rate function which is constant between observation moments @xmath60 but differs freely between periods @xmath61 . with the inclusion of such a parameter , the numerical values @xmath60",
    "become unimportant because changes in their values can be compensated by the multiplicative rate parameters .",
    "popular models for analyzing cross - sectional network data are exponential families of graph distributions such as the markov model of frank and strauss ( @xcite ) , generalized to the @xmath62 exponential random graph ( erg ) model by frank ( @xcite ) and wasserman and pattison ( @xcite ) , and elaborated and further specified by hunter and handcock ( @xcite ) and snijders et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "discrete - time markov chain models , as longitudinal models of this kind , were proposed by robins and pattison ( @xcite ) , krackhardt and handcock ( @xcite ) , and hanneke and xing ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are a number of essential differences between these models and the actor - oriented model treated here , with respect to interpretation as well as statistical procedures .",
    "when applying the actor - oriented model to a sequence of two or more repeated observations , these observations are embedded in a continuous - time model .",
    "this has clear face validity in applications where changes in the network take place at arbitrary moments between observations .",
    "singer ( @xcite ) gives an overview of the use of this principle for continuously distributed data .",
    "this approach yields a major advantage over the cited longitudinal erg models : our probability model is defined independently of the observational design .",
    "data from irregularly spaced observation intervals can be analyzed without the need to make any adaptations .",
    "another advantage is that the dynamic process is defined parsimoniously as a function of its elementary constituents  in this case , the conditional probability of a single tie change .",
    "the  random utility interpretation of ( [ choiceprob ] ) , discussed above , gives an interpretation in terms of myopic optimization of an objective function to which a random disturbance is added , and which can be used to represent a `` social mechanism '' that could have given rise to the observed dynamics .",
    "the  discrete - time erg models constitute exponential families , which has the advantage that many standard techniques can be directly applied .",
    "the  distribution of the continuous - time process @xmath63 for the actor - oriented model constitutes an exponential family , so for discrete observation moments our model can be regarded as an incompletely observed exponential family . for both types of model",
    ", inference is computer - intensive and time - consuming because of the need to implement elaborate mcmc procedures .",
    "the  definition of the model given above can be used directly to simulate data from the probability distribution , conditional on an initial state of the network .",
    "this contrasts with models in the erg family , which can be simulated only indirectly , by regarding them as the stationary distribution of an auxiliary markov chain , and applying a gibbs or metropolis  hastings algorithm .",
    "the  near degeneracy problem [ snijders et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ] which plagues some specifications of erg models is , in practice , not a problem for the actor - oriented model .",
    "this section presents an algorithm for mcmc approximation of the maximum likelihood estimate .",
    "estimation is done conditional on the first observation @xmath64 .",
    "this has the advantage that no model assumptions need to be invoked concerning the probability distribution that may have led to the first observed network @xmath64 , and the estimated parameters refer exclusively to the dynamics of the network .",
    "the  algorithm proposed below can be sketched as follows . for each @xmath65(@xmath66 )",
    "the observed data are augmented with random draws from the sequence of intermediate digraphs @xmath67 that could have led from one observation , @xmath68 , to the next , @xmath1 ( section  [ s_aug ] ) .",
    "these draws can be simulated using a metropolis  hastings algorithm ( section  [ s_sim ] ) .",
    "they are then used in the updating steps of a robbins  monro algorithm , following ideas of gu and kong ( @xcite ) , to find the solution of the likelihood equation ( section  [ s_appr ] ) .",
    "these elements are put together in section  [ s_multi ] .      the  likelihood for the observed data @xmath69 conditional on @xmath64",
    "can not generally be expressed in a computable form .",
    "therefore , the observed data will be augmented with data such that an easily computable likelihood is obtained , employing the general data augmentation principle proposed by tanner and wong ( @xcite ) .",
    "the  data augmentation can be done for each period @xmath61 separately and , therefore , this section considers only the observations @xmath64 and @xmath70 .",
    "denote the time points of an opportunity for change by @xmath71 and their total number between @xmath72 and @xmath73 by @xmath74 , the time points being ordered increasingly so that @xmath75 .",
    "the  model assumptions imply that at each time  @xmath71 , there is one actor , denoted @xmath76 , who gets an opportunity for change at this time moment .",
    "define @xmath77 as the actor toward whom the tie variable is changed , and define formally @xmath78 if there is no change [ i.e. , if @xmath79 ) ] : @xmath80 given @xmath64 , the outcome of the stochastic process @xmath81 , @xmath82 completely determines @xmath83 .",
    "the  augmenting data consist of @xmath74 and @xmath84 , @xmath82 , without the time points @xmath71 .",
    "it may be noted that this differs from the definition of a sample path in koskinen and snijders ( @xcite ) in that the times in between opportunities for change are integrated out ; the reason is to obtain a simpler mcmc algorithm .",
    "the  possible outcomes of the augmenting data are determined by the condition @xmath85 for all @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "the  stochastic process @xmath88 , @xmath89 will be referred to as the sample path ; the elements for which @xmath90 , although redundant to calculate @xmath70 from @xmath64 , are retained because they facilitate the computation of the likelihood .",

    "several methods for mcmc maximum likelihood estimation have been proposed in the literature .",
    "we shall use the markov chain stochastic approximation ( mcsa ) algorithm proposed by gu and kong ( @xcite ) and used ( in a slightly different specification ) also by gu and zhu ( @xcite ) .",
    "this algorithm is based on the missing information principle of orchard and woodbury ( @xcite ) and louis ( @xcite)going back to fisher ( @xcite ) ; cf .",
