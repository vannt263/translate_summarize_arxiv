    "many currently used refrigerant gases have a great impact on the environment since they either contribute largely to the greenhouse gas effect , or because they tear the ozone layer , or both . in an attempt to protect the environment , regulations preventing the production and use of certain refrigerant gases",
    "have been implemented @xcite .",
    "gas detectors are widespread for detection , tracking and triggering of charged particles such as muons in nuclear and high energy physics ( hep ) .",
    "they are characterized by simple and reliable use , but utmost care must be taken to issues such as properties of gas interaction with materials , gas purification , gas mixture contaminants , etc .",
    "@xcite- @xcite .",
    "a large part of gas muon detectors used in hep operates with mixtures containing the regulated refrigerants as quenching medium in applications where excellent time resolution and avalanche operation are necessary .",
    "therefore , actions towards finding new mixtures must be undertaken .",
    "gas electron multiplier ( gem ) @xcite detectors operate in experiments such as cms ( compact muon solenoid ) at the lhc ( large hadron collider ) with an argon / co@xmath4 mixture @xcite .",
    "however , for high time resolution applications an argon / co@xmath4/cf@xmath5 mixture is used @xcite , where cf@xmath5 has a global - warming potential ( gwp ) of 7390 @xcite .",
    "resistive plate counters ( rpc ) @xcite currently operate with a f - based r134a / isobutane / sf@xmath6 gas mixture , with typical gwp of 1430 .",
    "investigations into new gas mixtures has to be performed in order to keep the mixture properties while complying with the regulations .",
    "a few industrial refrigerant industrial replacements were proposed @xcite as alternatives to r134a . a study of transport properties of currently used gas mixtures in hep , and evaluation of transport properties of freon - less gas mixtures ,",
    "was recently published @xcite@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss some of the important properties of gases for particle gas detectors , to list and summarize basic properties of eco - friendly refrigerants from the literature , to discuss their properties for materials compatibility and safe use , and make a prediction on selected parameters crucial for the performance of gas detectors considered .",
    "while this study is aimed to gem and rpc detectors , its findings can be considered for selection of ecogas replacement for other gas detectors .",
    "for a gas mixture to be appropriate in a gas detector , first of all it has to comply with the regulations .",
    "furthermore , its properties must also be appropriate for the specific type of detectors .",
    "for example , a gas that is suitable for the rpc detectors may not be fully optimized for the gem detectors . to better find the appropriate gas for a detector , an understanding of the influence of different parameters",
    "is required .",
    "this section aims to clarify the most essential parameters for gases .      in order to estimate the impact of a refrigerant on the environment , the effects have to be quantified .",
    "two important effects are the contribution to the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer .",
    "the first mentioned effect is measured in global - warming potential ( gwp ) , and is normalized to the effect of co@xmath4 ( gwp = 1 ) , while the effect on the ozone layer is measured in ozone depletion potential ( odp ) , normalized to the effect of ccl@xmath7f ( odp = 1 ) .",
    "the effects of selected refrigerant candidates are listed in table [ table : summary ] .",
    "when a particle passes through a medium , energy is transferred from the particle to the surroundings .",
    "the energy lost is typically defined as the stopping power expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the density of the medium , e denotes energy , and x is length .",
    "this expression is itself dependent on the momentum @xmath10 of the particle . in the next section",
    "it will be shown the particle will experience a minimum energy loss at around @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the particle mass , and @xmath13 is the speed of light . by knowing the average minimum energy loss , we also know the minimum energy the particle loses by passing through a detector .",
    "the minimum mean ionization energies for the refrigerants under consideration are summarized in table [ table : calculated_quantities ] .",
    "the radiation length @xmath14 is a characteristic length of a medium .",
    "it describes both the mean distance required for a high energy electron to lose all but @xmath15 of its energy due to bremsstrahlung , and @xmath16 of the mean free path of a @xmath17 pair produced by a high - energy photon @xcite .",
    "these quantities are also estimated and summarized in table [ table : calculated_quantities ] .",
    "when an incoming particle passes through a medium , it will eventually interact with the medium and transfer some of its energy to ionize atoms . in this process , a pair consisting of an ionized atom and a free electron is produced . the number of ionizations produced by an incoming particle per unit length is denoted by @xmath18 , in units of @xmath19 .",
    "each produced ion pair will have an initial kinetic energy and can itself produce an ion pair , called secondary ion pair production .",
    "the sum of the primary and secondary ion pairs production per unit length is denoted @xmath20 , and will be mainly depending on the material and the incoming particle energy and mass .",
    "this parameter is relevant in particle gas detectors as it determines both the number and the size of avalanches produced by a single incoming particle when the gas is under an amplifying electric field .      in the absence of electric field",
    ", electrons move randomly in all direction having an average thermal energy @xmath21 . in presence of an electric field ,",
    "the electrons start to drift along the field direction with mean drift velocity @xmath22 ( the average distance covered by the drift electron per unit time ) .",
    "the drift velocity depends on the pressure , temperature and could be affected by the presence of pollutants like water or oxygen .",
    "electric field lines are , in addition , deformed by any magnetic field applied to the gas volume . finally , electronegative pollutants deplete the gas of electrons .",
    "computer codes such as magboltz @xcite computes the drift velocity using montecarlo techniques , by tracing electrons at the microscopic level through numerous collisions with gas molecules .",
    "electrons and ions in a gas are subject only to an electric field and move on average along the electric field , but individual electrons deviate from the average due to scattering on the atoms of the gas . scattering leads to variations in velocity , called longitudinal diffusion , and to lateral displacements , called transverse diffusion .",
    "the scattering process in each direction can , to a good approximation , be considered gaussian on a microscopic scale . in cold gases like carbon - dioxide for example ,",
    "the diffusion is small , while the drift velocity is low and unsaturated for values of electric fields common in gas detectors ; this implies a non linear space time relation .",
    "warm gases , like argon for instance , have a higher diffusion ; when mixed with polyatomic / organic gases having vibrational thresholds between 0.1 and 0.5 ev , diffusion is reduced in most cases , while the drift velocity is increased .",
    "the average distance an electron travels between ionizing collisions is called mean free path and its inverse is the number of ionizing collision per centimeter @xmath23 ( the first townsend coefficient ) .",
    "this parameter determines the gas gain of the gas . if @xmath24 is the number of primary electron without amplification in uniform electric field , and @xmath25 is the number of electrons after distance @xmath26 under avalanche condition , then @xmath25 is given by @xmath27 and the gas gain @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "the first townsend coefficient depends on the nature of the gas , the electric field and pressure . to take into account the augmented emission of electrons by the cathode caused by impact of positive ions , it is customary to introduce @xmath30 , townsend s second ionization coefficient or attachment parameter , _ i.e. _ , the average number of electrons released from a surface by an incident positive ion , according to the formula @xmath31      because of the deflection effect exerted by a magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field and the motion of the electron , the electron moves in a helical trajectory resulting in a lowered drift velocity and transverse dispersion .",
    "thus the arrival time of electrons at the anode changes and the spread in the drift time increases .",
    "the angle which the drifting electron swarm makes with the electric field is defined as the lorentz angle of the particular gas or gas mixture under consideration .",
    "the lorentz angle depends on both the electric field and the magnetic field .",
    "it is normally large at small electric fields but falls to smaller values for larger electric fields and is approximately linear with increasing magnetic field .",
    "many refrigerants may constitute danger for the user and its environment .",
    "the greatest dangers involved are the flammability and toxicity .",
    "we have used two standards in categorizing the refrigerants in table [ table:1 ] and [ table:2 ] .",
    "the ashrae standard @xcite gives each refrigerant a number denoting flammability from 1 ( not flammable ) to 3 ( highly flamable ) , as well as a letter a ( non - toxic ) or b ( toxic ) .",
    "the health material hazardous material information system ( hmis ) , rates health/ flammability/ and physical hazards from 0 ( low ) to 4 ( high ) .",
    "some refrigerants are incompatible with certain materials , and can either react violently , or have long term effect .",
    "some refrigerants may even produce toxic decomposition and/or polymerization .",
    "known incompatibilities and toxic byproducts are summarized in table [ table:1 ] and [ table:2 ] .",
    "aging is defined ( following @xcite ) the general deterioration of the detectors during their operation .",
    "the aging phenomenon is very complex and depends on several parameters .",
    "the commonly used variables include the cross - sections , electron / photon energies , electrostatic forces , dipole moments , chemical reactivity of atoms and molecules , etc . for a comprehensive ( although non recent ) collection see @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "a more recent review of ageing effects in gem detectors can be found in @xcite .",
