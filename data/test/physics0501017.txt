    "in nature , there exists a variety of systems that involve chemical reactions .",
    "some are on a geographical - scale , while others on a nano - scale .",
    "chemical reactions are an integral part of life , including all living forms of life .    to study the dynamics of reaction systems , we often adopt rate equations in order to observe the change in chemical concentrations . in rate equations , we regard the concentrations as continuous variables ; the rate of the reaction as a function of the concentrations . in macroscopic systems ,",
    "there are a vast number of molecules ; thus , continuous representations are usually applicable",
    ".    when the concentration of a certain chemical is small , fluctuations in the reactions or flow can be significant .",
    "we often handle such systems with the help of stochastic differential equations , in which we regard noise as a continuum description of the fluctuations @xcite .",
    "such an approximation is useful when the number of molecules is intermediate .",
    "the employment of stochastic differential equations led to some important discoveries such as noise - induced order @xcite , noise - induced phase transitions @xcite , and stochastic resonance @xcite .    in stochastic differential equations ,",
    "still quantities of chemicals are regarded as continuous variables .",
    "essentially , on a microscopic level , chemicals are composed of molecules .",
    "the number of molecules should be an integer ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) , which changes discretely .",
    "fluctuations are derivatives of discrete stochastic changes ; thus , continuum descriptions of fluctuations are not always appropriate and can be doubted . for chemicals with a small number of molecules of the order of @xmath1 ,",
    "a single molecule is extremely significant ; therefore , the discreteness in the number is significant .",
    "biological cells appear to be a good example .",
    "the size of the cells is of the order of microns , in which nano - scale `` quantum '' effects can be ignored .",
    "however , in cells , some chemicals act at extremely low concentrations of the order of pm or nm .",
    "assuming that the typical volume of a cell ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath4 @xmath5 , the concentration of one molecule in the cell volume corresponds to @xmath6 pm@xmath6 nm .",
    "it is probable that the molecular numbers of some chemicals in a cell are of the order of @xmath1 , or sometimes reach @xmath0 .",
    "if such chemicals play only a minor role , we can safely ignore these chemicals .",
    "however , this is not always the case . in biological systems , chemical species with a small number of molecules may critically affect the behavior of the entire system .",
    "for example , there exist only one or a few copies of genetic molecules such as dna , which are important to characterize the behavior , in each cell .",
    "further , some experiments show that doses of particular chemicals at concentrations of the order of pm or fm may alter the behavior of the cells ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "biological systems also include positive - feedback mechanisms such as autocatalytic reactions , which may amplify single molecular changes to a macroscopic level .",
    "the effects due to small molecular numbers in cells have been noticed only recently , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    at present , we focus on the possible effects of molecular discreteness . to study such effects , we should adopt an appropriate method to handle molecular discreteness .",
    "some numerical methods to investigate reaction systems that take into account discreteness and stochasticity already exist ( we briefly review these methods ; see appendix ) . among the methods , we adopted gillespie s direct method , which is popular and frequently used .",
    "furthermore , some works related to molecular discreteness also exist .",
    "for example , blumenfeld et al . showed that the mass action law may breakdown in a small system @xcite .",
    "stange et al . studied the synchronization of the turnover cycle of enzymes @xcite .",
    "we regard it important to identify the phenomena for which molecular discreteness is essential .    through stochastic simulations ,",
    "we show that discreteness can induce transitions to novel states in autocatalytic systems @xcite , which may affect macroscopic chemical concentrations @xcite .",
    "we consider a simple autocatalytic network ( loop ) with @xmath7 chemicals .",
    "we consider @xmath8 chemicals and assume @xmath9 reactions between these chemicals ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 ; @xmath11 ) .",
    "all the reactions are irreversible . for the reactor , we assume a well - stirred container with volume @xmath12 .",
    "the set of @xmath13 , the number of @xmath8 molecules , determines the state of the system .",
    "the container is in contact with a chemical reservoir , in which the concentration of @xmath8 is fixed at @xmath14 .",
    "the flow rate of @xmath8 between the container and the reservoir is @xmath15 , which corresponds to the probability of the flowing out of a molecule per time unit is the diffusion rate across the surface of the container . here ,",
    "we choose the flow proportional to @xmath12 , to have a well - defined continuum limit .",
    "one might assume the flow proportional to @xmath16 , considering the area of the surface . by rescaling @xmath17 ,",
    "the model can be rewritten into the case with @xmath16 for finite @xmath12 . ] .",
    "we can consider the continuum limit as @xmath18 . in the continuum limit",
    ", the change of @xmath19 , the chemical concentration @xmath8 in the container , follows the rate equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rate constant of the reaction @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    for simplicity",

    ", each @xmath19 converges to @xmath31 , the fixed point value . around the fixed point ,",
    "@xmath19 vibrates with the frequency @xmath32 .",
    "if the number of molecules is finite but fairly large , we can estimate the dynamical behavior of the system using a langevin equation , obtained by adding a noise term to the rate equation .",
    "each concentration @xmath19 fluctuates and vibrates around the fixed point .",
    "an increase in the noise ( corresponding to a decrease in the number of molecules ) merely boosts the fluctuation .",
    "however , when the number of molecules is small , the behavior of the system is completely different .",
    "first , we investigate the case when @xmath33 , which is the smallest number of species to show the novel states described below .",
    "subsequently , we investigate the dynamical behavior of the system with a small number of molecules . in order to detect the phenomena for which the discreteness of the number of molecules is crucial , we employ stochastic simulations .    here ,",
    "we adopt gillespie s direct method .",
    "the frequency ( expected number per unit time )    * of the reaction @xmath22 is @xmath34 ; * of the outflow of @xmath8 is @xmath35 ; * of the inflow of @xmath8 is @xmath36 .    in the continuum limit ( @xmath18 ) , these frequencies agree with the rate equation .",
    "we calculate these frequencies with the current @xmath13 , and stochastically decide when and which event will occur next .    in this case , by an appropriate conversion of @xmath17 , @xmath12 , and @xmath37 , we can set @xmath28 and @xmath31 to be @xmath1 without loss of the generality ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the only independent parameters ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the purpose of further discussion .",
    "the total number of molecules in the container , @xmath42 , is approximately @xmath43 on an average . by varying @xmath12",
    ", we can control the average number of molecules without changing the continuum limit .",
    "first , we consider the case of a large @xmath12 , i.e. , both the number of molecules in the container and flow of molecules between the container and the reservoir are large .",
    "as expected , the behavior of the system is similar to that of the rate equation with noise . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a-512 ] , each @xmath13 fluctuates and vibrates around the fixed point value @xmath44 ( i.e. @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is still in the realm of stochastic differential equations .",
    "however , when @xmath12 is small , we observe novel states that do not exist in the continuum limit . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a-032 ] , continuous vibrations disappear .",
    "furthermore , two chemicals are dominant and the other two are mostly extinct ( @xmath46 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a-032 ] , at @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 dominate the system and @xmath50 for the most part .",
    "we call such a state the 1 - 3 rich state .",
    "reversely , at @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are large and usually @xmath54 .",
    "we call this state the 2 - 4 rich state .",
    "these states appear because of the following reason . in this system",
    ", the production of @xmath8 molecules requires at least one @xmath8 molecule as a catalyst . if @xmath8 becomes extinct , the production of @xmath8 halts .",
    "@xmath13 never regains before an @xmath8 molecule flows in .    in the rate equation ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tr1-rate ] ) ) , the concentration @xmath19 is a continuous variable , which can be an infinitesimal but positive value .",
    "the consumption rate of @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath19 itself ; thus , @xmath19 can not reach @xmath0 exactly within finite time , even if it can go to @xmath0 asymptotically as @xmath55 .",
    "in fact , the number of molecules must be an integer .",
    "transitions from @xmath56 to @xmath46 are probabilistic and may happen in finite time . for transitions to occur",
    ", it is important that the consumption rate of @xmath19 does not converge to @xmath0 at @xmath57 .",
    "the average interval of a molecule flowing in is @xmath58 for each chemical .",
    "if @xmath17 and @xmath12 are small enough to ensure that the inflow interval is longer than the time scale of the reactions , it is likely that the state of the system @xmath56 drops to @xmath46 before an @xmath8 molecule enters .    when @xmath13 reaches @xmath0 , @xmath59 is also likely to become @xmath0 .",
    "for example , if we assume that @xmath60 , then @xmath48 is likely to increase because the consumption of @xmath61 halts ; @xmath49 is likely to decrease because the production of @xmath62 halts .",
    "thus , this results in @xmath63 . when @xmath63 , the consumption rate of @xmath64 is larger than the production rate of @xmath64 ; therefore , @xmath53 starts to decrease and often reaches @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath50 , all the reactions stop .",
    "the system stays at @xmath50 for a long time as compared with the ordinary time scale of the reactions ( @xmath65 ) .",

    ", the system alternately switches between @xmath63 and @xmath66 .",
    "we consider that the system is in the 1 - 3 rich state with @xmath63 .",
    "one @xmath67 molecule flowing in may resume the reactions @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "generally , the former is faster because @xmath63 ; hence , @xmath52 is likely to increase . since @xmath53 = 0 , the reactions are one - way ; @xmath48 decreases and @xmath49 increases . when @xmath66 , @xmath52 starts to decrease .",
    "finally , when @xmath52 returns to @xmath0 , the reactions halt again .",

    "the inflow of @xmath64 can switch the system from @xmath66 to @xmath63 in the 1 - 3 rich state .",
    "consequently , we observe successive switching between @xmath63 and @xmath66 . in the 2 - 4 rich state ,",

    ", even one molecule can switch the system within the 1 - 3 or 2 - 4 rich states .",
    "we name these states `` switching states '' .",
    "now , we investigate some properties of the switching states .",
    "we introduce an index @xmath72 as a characteristic of the switching states . around the fixed point of the rate equation , @xmath73 ; in the 1 - 3 rich state , @xmath74 ; in the 2 - 4 rich state , @xmath75 .    the distribution of @xmath76 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - ac - bd ] . when @xmath77 , a single peak appears around @xmath78 , which corresponds to the fixed point . by decreasing @xmath12 ,",
    "the peak broadens with fluctuations .",
    "when @xmath79 , double peaks appear at @xmath80 , which correspond to the switching states .",
    "we clearly observe a symmetry - breaking transition between a continuous vibration around the fixed point with large @xmath12 and the switching states with small @xmath12 .",
    "this is a discreteness - induced transition ( dit ) that occurs with decrease of @xmath12 , which is not seen in continuum descriptions .",
    "we introduce another index @xmath81 , which represents the difference in concentrations : @xmath82 in the 1 - 3 rich state and @xmath83 in the 2 - 4 rich state . the distribution of @xmath84 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - ab - cd ] .",
    "there are double peaks around @xmath85 , which imply large imbalances , such as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , between @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the 1 - 3 rich state ( as well as the 2 - 4 rich state ) .",
    "we investigate some properties of the switching states .",
    "first , we examine how each @xmath13 changes in a switching event .",
    "we assume the 1 - 3 rich state with @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . here , one @xmath67 molecule flows in ( @xmath91 ) at @xmath92 , which starts up the reactions . assuming that @xmath93 is so small that no more molecules flow in or out throughout the switching , the total number of molecules @xmath94 is conserved at @xmath95 , and @xmath53 is always @xmath0 .",
    "we can represent the state with two variables , @xmath48 and @xmath52 .    in this system ,",
    "only the following types of reactions    * @xmath96 and * @xmath97    may change @xmath13 ; the others never take place . @xmath48",
    "monotonously decreases . when @xmath52 reaches @xmath0 , these reactions halt completely , and the switching is completed . evidently , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the final values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the frequency of the reaction @xmath96 is @xmath101 and that of @xmath97 is @xmath102 we obtain the master equation @xmath103 for @xmath104 , the probability of residence in the state @xmath105 at time @xmath37 .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath106 ; otherwise @xmath107 .",
    "we can easily follow the master equation numerically .",
    "we investigate the relationship between the initial state @xmath108 and the final state @xmath109 .    if the first reaction is @xmath97 , @xmath52 instantaneously reaches @xmath0 , and as a result @xmath110 . the system fails to switch .",
    "if @xmath111 , it is more probable that the first reaction is @xmath96 .",
    "subsequently , the system carries out further reactions . in this case , it is probable that @xmath112 , i.e. , the system swaps @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - swprob-128 ] .",
    "consequently , we observe successive switching ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : a-032 ] ) .    when @xmath113 , the system is likely to reach @xmath114 and break the 1 - 3 rich state . a large imbalance between @xmath48 and @xmath49 results in an unstable 1 - 3 rich state .",
    "now , we investigate the requirements for the transitions to the switching states . the rate of residence of the switching states for several @xmath17 and @xmath12 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - type1a ] . for approximately @xmath115",
    ", we observe the switching states .",
    "if @xmath116 , the system mostly stays in the switching states .",
    "subsequently , we expect that switching states appear even for large @xmath12 if @xmath17 is very small .",
    "in fact , we observe switching states for @xmath117 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a-10000 ] .",
    "furthermore , in this case also , a single molecule can induce switching .    strictly speaking ,",
    "if @xmath93 is the same , the rate of residence is a little smaller for larger @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath12 is large , the system takes longer to reach @xmath46 even if the rate of reaction and the initial concentrations are the same .",
    "thus , it is less likely to exhibit switching states for the same interval of the inflow , @xmath58 .    in general , some reactions are much faster than the inflow .",
    "if the number of molecules which enter within the time scale of the reactions is of the order of @xmath1 for a certain chemical , the reactions may consume all the molecules of the chemical , and the molecular discreteness of the chemical becomes significant .",
    "in other words , for the effect of the discreteness to appear in a system with several processes , it is important that the number of events of a process within the time scale of another process is of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "once the system is in the switching state , it is fairly stable and difficult to escape , especially if @xmath93 is small . to escape the 1 - 3 rich state and regain continuous vibration , at least one @xmath67 molecule and one @xmath64 molecule should flow in and",
    "it is required that after an @xmath67 molecule flows in , an @xmath64 molecule should flow in before @xmath52 returns to @xmath0 , or vice versa .",
    "we put one @xmath67 molecule into the system in the 1 - 3 rich state at @xmath92 , and one @xmath64 molecule in at @xmath118 .",
    "we assume that @xmath93 is so small that no more molecules flow in or out .",
    "then , we judge whether the system escapes from the 1 - 3 rich state .",
    "in due course , the system returns to the 1 - 3 rich ( or sometimes 2 - 4 rich ) state because there is no further flow ; thus , we should judge at the right moment . here ,",
    "if @xmath119 for all @xmath27 at @xmath120 ( i.e. , waiting about 2.5 times longer than the period of the oscillation around the fixed point ) , we consider that the 1 - 3 rich state has been interrupted .",
    "we measure the probability of interruption for various initial conditions and the delay @xmath121 as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : a - sw3b-32 ] .",
    "the system requires adequate timing of inflow to escape the switching states , which may amplify the imbalance between the stability of each state .",
    "for example , to escape the 1 - 3 rich , @xmath63 state , it is required that an @xmath67 molecule flows in , and then an @xmath64 molecule flows in with a certain delay @xmath121 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - sw3b-32 ] .",
    "thus , the frequency of escape from the 1 - 3 rich state is approximately proportional to the product of the inflow frequencies of @xmath67 and @xmath64 .",
    "if each @xmath15 or @xmath14 is species - dependent , the stability of the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states may strongly depend on @xmath122 , the inflow frequency of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , if at the outset @xmath123 , it is difficult for the system to escape from the 1 - 3 rich state . in some cases where the parameters are species - dependent , the flows or the switching may lead to @xmath123 , which stabilizes the 1 - 3 rich state .",
    "these conditions are important to stabilize particular states and affect the macroscopic behavior of the system ( see section [ sect : tr2 ] ) .",
    "to close the section [ sect : tr1 ] , we briefly discuss the cases where @xmath124 .",
    "figure [ fig : a - k356 - 16 ] shows the time series of each @xmath13 for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . when @xmath128 , 1 - 3 - 5 rich and 2 - 4 - 6 rich states appear .",
    "however , these states are less stable than the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states for @xmath33 .",
    "these states collapse when any of the rich chemicals vanish ; thus , they are unstable for large @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath7 is odd ( @xmath129 , @xmath126 , @xmath3 ) , there are no stable states where particular chemicals are extinct . however , additional reactions , or a variety of @xmath21 or @xmath14 , may stabilize or destabilize the states such that it is not always true that loops with odd-@xmath7 are unstable .",
    "the discreteness - induced transitions are not limited in the autocatalytic loop .",
    "we apply the abovementioned discussions to certain segments of a complicated reaction network with a slight modification .",
    "in the preceding section , we show that the discreteness of the molecules can induce transitions to novel `` switching '' states in autocatalytic systems .    for the case where @xmath33 with uniform parameters , the 1 - 3 rich state and the 2 - 4 rich state are equivalent . in due course , the system alternates between the 1 - 3 rich and 2 - 4 rich states .",
    "the long - term averaged concentrations are still the same as the continuum limit value , @xmath130",
    ".    it will be important if macroscopic properties , such as the average concentrations , can be altered .",
    "we show that the discreteness - induced transitions may alter the long - term averaged concentrations .",
    "once again , here , we adopt the autocatalytic reaction loop @xmath9 for the @xmath33 species .",
    "now we consider the case where the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath14 , or @xmath21 are species - dependent . in the continuum limit",
    ", the concentration @xmath19 is governed by the rate equation @xmath131 the rate equation does not contain the volume @xmath12 ; hence , the average concentrations should be independent of @xmath12 .    as discussed in the preceding section , for the transitions to the switching states to occur , it is necessary that the interval of the inflow is longer than the time scale of the reactions . in this model ,",
    "the inflow interval of @xmath8 is @xmath132 , and the time scale of the reaction @xmath22 in order to use @xmath8 up is @xmath133 . if all the chemicals are equivalent , the discreteness of all the chemicals equally take effect , and the 1 - 3 and 2 - 4 rich states coordinately appear at @xmath134 .",
    "now , since the parameters are species - dependent , the effect of discreteness may be different for each species .",
    "for example , assuming that @xmath135 , the inflow interval of @xmath61 is longer than that of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the discreteness of the inflow of @xmath61 may be significant for larger @xmath12 .    to demonstrate a possible effect of the discreteness on the macroscopic properties of the system",

    "when @xmath12 is small , the discreteness causes @xmath136 to be very different from the continuum limit .",
    "we first investigate the case where each @xmath14 is species - dependent ( i.e. , each inflow rate is species - dependent ) , and each @xmath15 and @xmath21 are uniform ( @xmath25 , @xmath137 ) .",
    "later , we briefly discuss the case where @xmath21 is inhomogeneous .",
    "as mentioned in section [ subsect : tr1-cond ] , for the effect of the discreteness to appear , it is important that the interval of events of a process is of the order of or longer than the time scale of another process . as regards the inflow ,",
    "there are two indices to determine how the discreteness appears :    * the inflow interval , @xmath138 , * the number of molecules at equilibrium , @xmath139 .",
    "if the inflow interval , @xmath138 , is longer than the time scale of the reactions , the reactions may exhaust the chemical before the chemical enters , and the inflow discreteness becomes significant .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath139 is smaller than @xmath1 , @xmath13 can reach @xmath0 because of the outflow .",
    "in such cases , the relation between the inflow interval and the outflow time scale is also important .",

    "molecular discreteness should be significant for such chemicals , and may be relevant to characters of genetic molecules .",
    "until now , we have modeled reactions in a well - stirred medium , where only the number of molecules is taken into account while determining the behavior . however ,",

    "both the total number of molecules and the spatial distributions of the molecules may be significant . from a biological point of view",
    ", the diffusion in space is also important because the diffusion in cells is not always fast as compared with the time scales of the reactions .",

    "the relation between these time scales will be important , as indicated by mikhailov and hess @xcite .",
    "as regards these time scales , we recently found that the spatial discreteness of molecules within the so - called kuramoto length @xcite , over which a molecule diffuses in its lifetime ( lapses before it undergoes reaction ) , may yield novel steady states that are not observed in the reaction - diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "there is still room for exploration in this field , e.g. , pattern formation .",
    "our result does not depend on the details of the reaction and may be applicable to systems beyond reactions , such as ecosystems or economic systems .",

    "since the 1970s , several methods have been suggested for simulating discrete reaction systems .",
    "we briefly review some of these methods : stochsim method , gillespie s methods , and their improved versions .",
    "these methods are based on chemical master equations . in chemical master equations ,",
    "we define the state of the system as the number of molecules in each chemical ; the reaction process as a series of transitions between the states .",
    "we consider each event , i.e. , a reaction event between molecules , inflow or outflow of a molecule , as a transition .",
    "they take place stochastically with a certain frequency ( probability per time unit ) determined by the current state .    for the simulations used in this study , we adopted gillespie s direct method for simplicity .",
    "we also attempted a direct simulation and the next reaction method , and confirmed that our result does not depend on the simulation method .        in this method , we fix the time step as @xmath201 . assuming that the frequency of the event-@xmath27 is @xmath202 , the average number of the event-@xmath27 for each step is @xmath203 . if @xmath204 , we approximately assume that at most one event occurs at each step , and the probability of the event-@xmath27 is @xmath203 ( it is possible that no event occurs in the step ) .",
    "we select an event with a random number , change the state according to the event , and recalculate each @xmath202 .",
    "the stochsim method adopts random sampling of molecules . for bimolecular reactions , we randomly choose two molecules from the system , and decide whether they react or not with certain probability .",
    "the method requires three random numbers in total for each step . in case",
    "there are some single molecular ( first - order ) reactions , we choose the second molecule from the molecules in the system and some pseudo - molecules ( dummies ) .",
    "if the second molecule is a pseudo - molecule , then we select the single molecular reaction of the first molecule , and determine whether it occurs .    in the stochsim method , @xmath201 is restricted by the fastest reaction ( with the largest reaction rate per pair of molecules ) .",
    "if most of the bimolecular pairs do not react with each other , or the reaction probability varies with the species , this method may be impractical because no reaction occurs in most steps",
    ".      incidentally , if the system consists of discrete molecules , it is typical that each frequency @xmath202 changes only when an event actually occurs . taking this into account ,",
    "gillespie suggested two exact simulation methods : the direct method @xcite and the first reaction method @xcite . in these methods , we do not fix the time step .",
    "instead , we calculate the time lapse until the next event .    in the direct method , first , we consider the total frequency of the events , @xmath205 .",
    "if @xmath202 does not change until the next event , the time lapse until the next event , @xmath121 , is exponentially distributed as @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "we determine the time lapse @xmath121 with an exponentially distributed random number .",
    "subsequently , the probability that the next event is @xmath27 is @xmath208 .",
    "we determine which event occurs with a random number .",
    "we then set the time @xmath37 forward by @xmath121 , update the state according to the event , and recalculate each frequency @xmath202 .",
    "iterate the above steps until the designated time elapses .",
    "the first reaction method is similar to the direct method .",
    "it is based on the fact that @xmath209 , the time lapse until the next event-@xmath27 , is exponentially distributed as @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "only the event with minimum @xmath209 actually occurs .",
    "we update the state , recalculate each @xmath202 , and generate all @xmath209 again with the new corresponding @xmath202 .    in the first reaction method",
    ", we need as many random numbers each step as the types of events .",
    "we calculate all @xmath209 , choose the earliest , and discard the others .",
    "generally , the processor time to generate random numbers is very large ; hence , a large amount of time is wasted for several types of events .      to solve this performance problem ,",
    "gibson and bruck proposed a refinement of the first reaction method : next reaction method @xcite .",
    "although , in general , monte carlo simulations require independency of random numbers , they proved a safe way of recycling random numbers , which drastically promotes efficiency .    in the next reaction method , we store @xmath212 , the absolute time when the next event-@xmath27 occurs , instead of @xmath209",
    "in the first step , we have to calculate @xmath213 for every @xmath27 , according to the exponential distribution @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) .",

    "as regards the event just executed , we should recalculate @xmath214 with the exponential distribution of @xmath209 , identical to the first step .",
    "as regards other events whose frequency @xmath202 has changed , we should recalculate the corresponding @xmath212 .",
    "for such events , we convert @xmath212 as @xmath215 @xmath216 is the @xmath212 before the event and @xmath217 is that after the event .",

    "3 .   as for other events",
    "whose frequency @xmath202 has not changed , we do not need to recalculate the corresponding @xmath212 .",
