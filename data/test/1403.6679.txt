    "universality is the amazing phenomenon when the critical behavior arising in different physical systems is characterized by a common set of universal quantities .",
    "all systems belonging to a certain universality class share the same critical exponents , universal amplitude ratios and universal scaling functions .",
    "typically , universality classes are determined by spatial dimension , symmetry and the range of interaction potentials . at times ,",
    "two systems belonging to one universality class appear to be entirely disparate at first sight . in this paper",
    "we discuss such a remarkable case , _ viz_. that of driven surface diffusion under detailed balance conditions and crystalline solids near their shear instability .",
    "we show that these respectively two and three dimensional systems are described by a common field - theoretic hamiltonian .",
    "we calculate the scaling behavior of this universality class using field - theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) methods .",
    "surface growth problems constitute an important class of generic nonequilibrium phenomena @xcite .",
    "particles are deposited on a surface and can diffuse around on it . in ballistic deposition processes such as molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , desorption and bulk defect formation can often be neglected . after an initial transient , a steady state",
    "is established which is characterized by time - independent macroscopic properties , provided that a suitable reference frame is chosen .",
    "if one is primarily interested in universal , large - scale , long - time characteristics , the dynamical evolution can often be formulated in terms of a langevin equation which then can be analyzed using the methods of renormalized field theory .",
    "several years ago , schmittmann , pruessner and one of us ( h.k.j . )",
    "@xcite , denoted in the following as spj , extended a model by marsili , maritan , toigo , and banavar ( mmtb ) @xcite , to describe ballistic deposition processes with oblique particle incidence . in broad terms , their approach can be described as follows : it is assumed that there is no shadowing , i.e. , that there are no overhangs so that the growing surface can be described in terms of a height variable @xmath0 ( so - called monge representation ) . furthermore , it is assumed that particle desorption and bulk defect formation can be neglected , so that the ( deterministic ) surface relaxation processes are particle - number conserving .",
    "then , the time rate of change of the surface - hight is formulated in an idealized continuum description  @xcite in terms of the divergence of a current .",
    "since the absolute hight of the surface is irrelevant , these currents are constructed from the slope of the height @xmath1 and its derivatives .",
    "next , shot noise modeling the random deposition of the particles is incorporated into the growth equation by adding a non - conserving stochastic term which dominates the conserving diffusional noise . since the oblique particle beam selects a preferred ( longitudinal ) direction in the substrate plane , the resulting langevin equation is necessarily anisotropic , and the primary relaxation mechanism is driven surface diffusion .",
    "the interplay of interatomic interactions and kinetic effects , such as ehrlich - schwoebel barriers , generates an anisotropic effective surface tension which can become very small or even negative . due to the anisotropy , these mechanisms lead to a phase space with four different regimes , and the potentially scale - invariant behaviors in these regimes were studied by spj .",
    "the most interesting case turned out to have a transversal instability which leads to the generation of longitudinal ripples via a continuous phase transition in contrast to a longitudinal instability which leads to the generation of transversal ripples by a ( fluctuation induced ) first order transition .",
    "such ripple structures are commonly found in sandy deserts where they are generated under the influence of a steady wind as the driving force , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ripples ] .",
    "it is worth noting that mmtb and spj formulated their model under the assumption of an invariance with respect to tilts of the surface .",
    "however , in a real setup , the orientation of the basic surface relative to the incident particle beam is generally fixed , and hence it is useful to generalize their model to go beyond the limiting tilt - invariant case . here",
    ", in the present work , we do _ not _ assume tilt invariance",
    ". we will see as we move along that the resulting growth equation is in detailed balance when an appropriate co - moving coordinate system is used and a certain model parameter vanish . note that we use the term detailed balance  not in a microscopic sense @xcite .",
    "even if the microscopic laws lack detailed balance , coarse graining and the following neglect of irrelevant terms can lead to detailed balance in the asymptotic semi - macroscopic equation of motion for a driven system  @xcite . under the assumption that this is the case , we derive a quasi - static hamiltonian @xmath2 which describes the stationary distribution , and whose basic ingredients are derivatives of the surface height field @xmath3 .    the elastic free energy of crystalline solids with hexagonal or tetragonal ( including cubic ) symmetry shows an instability against shear when the elastic constant @xmath4 goes to zero .",
    "the crystallographic unit cell undergoes an elastic deformation with a certain linear combination of components of the strain tensor as an order parameter . in the case",
    "that no third order invariants of the order parameter are possible ( or vanish by chance in the cubic case ) , the transition to the structurally distorted crystal is continuous , and the order parameter can be reduced to the spatial derivatives of the displacement field @xmath5 along the crystallographic symmetry axis @xcite . augmenting the stretching energy with stabilizing bending terms and then reducing it to its parts that are relevant in the rg sense , we set up a generalized elastic energy that is of the same form as the aforementioned quasi - static hamiltonian @xmath2 with the displacement field @xmath6 taking on the role of the height field @xmath7 .",
    "note , however , there is one important distinction between the two systems .",
    "whereas in the driven diffusion problem , both the longitudinal component @xmath8 and the transversal components @xmath9 lie in the plane of the substrate , i.e. , in the plane orthogonal to the height @xmath1 , the coordinate @xmath8 in the elastic problem lies in the direction of the crystal axis and is therefore parallel to the displacement @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the physical dimension of @xmath9 is @xmath10 in driven surface diffusion and @xmath11 in the elastic transition .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we set up field theoretic models for driven surface diffusion with detailed balance and elastic phase transitions , respectively , through augmenting and modifying the existing models for these systems .",
    "we unify the two field theoretic models by formulating a hamiltonian that commonly describes both systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rpt ] we present our renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "we sketch our diagrammatic calculation , discuss the resulting renormalization group and its flow . in sec .",
    "[ sec : scalingandexponents ] , we derive the scaling forms for several experimentally measurable quantities . for driven surface diffusion ,",
    "we calculate critical exponents , and for elastic transitions we calculate logarithmic corrections to the leading mean - field behavior . in sec  [ sec : concludingremarks ] we give concluding remarks .",
    "appendix  [ app : calcdiagrams1loop ] contains some details on our calculation of feynman diagrams .",
    "appendix  [ app : addren ] discusses some intricacies related to the fact that the calculation of the specific heat for the elastic transitions requires additive renormalizations .",
    "here , we set up our model for driven surface diffusion following the work of mmtb  @xcite and spj .",
    "as a starting point , let us review the langevin equation presented by spj . in the to - interpretation , this langevin equation describes the hight @xmath0 of a @xmath12-dimensional growing hyper - surface as @xmath13 the incident particle beam has components @xmath14 and @xmath15 normal and parallel to the substrate plane , respectively .",
    "as discussed in detail by mmtb and spj , the oblique particle incidence induces a fundamental anisotropy into the system which breaks the full rotational symmetry within the @xmath12-dimensional space of the substrate . to account for this anisotropy , it is useful to choose a coordinate system in which a particular axis , say the @xmath8-axis , is aligned with @xmath15 and then to write the spatial coordinates as @xmath16 .",
    "the two uniform growth terms , the first two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ genlang ] ) , can be removed by a galilei transformation @xmath17 . in the following",
    ", we will work in this co - moving frame .",
    "@xmath18 is the surface current , and we model its longitudinal and transversal components following spj by @xmath19 note that under the assumptions made by mmtb and spj , @xmath20 . as we will discuss in more detail below",
    ", we will work under different assumptions here .",
    "the langevin noise @xmath21 accounts for the randomness in the particle deposition .",
    "because this shot noise adds particles to the surface , it is commonly modeled as non - conserving noise with correlations of the form @xmath22 in principle , conserved diffusional noise could also be incorporated into the model . however , it turns out to be irrelevant compared to the non - conserved noise .",
    "the character of the surface produced by the process depends on the values of the critical parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "our model leads to qualitatively the same phase diagram in the space spanned by @xmath23 and @xmath24 as the spj model , see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "this phase diagram contains , in particular , a continuous transition from isotropic , edwards - wilkinson  @xcite type behavior to a state characterized by longitudinal ripples for @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on this transition .",
    "the other transitions in the phase diagram which includes a fluctuation induced discontinuous transition to a surface with transversal ripples for @xmath27 and @xmath28 and a multi critical point for @xmath27 and @xmath29 are set aside for future work .",
    "now , we review the symmetries and the physical contents of the langevin equation  ( [ genlang ] ) with its ingredients ( [ parcurr ] ) to ( [ shot - noise ] ) in some more depths . the work by mmtp and spj assumed that the physics of the system is invariant under an infinitesimal tilt of the surface by an angle @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the assumption of this invariance enforces the relation @xmath20 mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "however , this tilt - invariance is non - physical since the orientation of the substrate plane is fixed by the normal component @xmath14 of the incident current . in the following , we will refrain from imposing this condition . stability demands positive @xmath32 and @xmath33 as well as @xmath34 . at the transition for @xmath25 and @xmath26 that we are interested in , @xmath32 and @xmath35 are irrelevant .",
    "the positive parameters @xmath33 and @xmath23 can be set equal to @xmath10 and a dimensionless positive parameter @xmath36 , respectively , via a simple rescaling of the coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that after this transformation , the coordinates , the time and the `` temperature '' scale as @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , where @xmath42 is an inverse external length scale appropriate to discuss the infrared limit that will be used in the renormalization program to follow .",
    "it thus follows from the langevin equations , eqs .",
    "( [ genlang ] ) and ( [ shot - noise ] ) , that the shot noise @xmath21 and the height @xmath1 scale as @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , the coupling constants scale as @xmath45 and @xmath46 which shows that @xmath47 is irrelevant and that the upper critical dimension is @xmath48 .",
    "returning to the tilt - invariance and the fact that we do not assume it in the present work , we note that there is a possible contribution to @xmath49 of the form @xmath50 that was omitted by mmtb and spj on grounds of tilt - invariance , and we have to consider it here .",
    "power counting reveals that @xmath51 , i.e. , this term is relevant .",
    "even if we omitted it at the onset , it would be generated by the rg .",
    "here , we include it in our model at this stage .",
    "we are interested here in driven surface diffusion with detailed balance so that the statistical properties of the steady state can be derived from a free energyor hamiltonian @xmath52 .",
    "for this to hold true , we have to be able to express the components of the surface current through functional derivatives of @xmath52 . because the absolute height of the surface should not matter , i.e.",
    ", @xmath53 with a constant @xmath54 should be a symmetry , the functional variation of @xmath52 with respect to @xmath1 should be of the form @xmath55 which defines the surface current @xmath18 up to divergence - free additive part .",
    "it is easy to see that this is possible if we equalize the coupling constants @xmath56 , and in the following we will do so .",
    "then the hamiltonian is given by@xmath57 for further details and background on detailed balance in the context of driven surface diffusion , we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is another symmetry present that we have not mentioned yet , viz .  the so - called up - down symmetry .",
    "this symmetry , which physically means that mounds and valleys have the same form , translates for mbe with oblique incidence to a form - invariance under the simultaneous inversion @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this type of up - down symmetry was assumed by mmtb and spj , and we also assume it here .",
    "however , even though it is frequently assumed in mbe theory , up - down symmetry has to be taken with a grain of salt because the particle beam sets a preferred direction in space .",
    "therefore , the up - down symmetry is strictly speaking more appropriate for interface than for surface models .",
    "we keep this symmetry here firstly because we are primarily interested in the connection between and the mutual properties of driven surface diffusion and elastic phase transitions and secondly because the up - down symmetry simplifies the model . in a sense , this simplified model can be viewed as a leading order approximation for mbe with oblique incidence that can be improved later by including terms that break the up - down symmetry .",
    "in fact , we plan to study the effects of breaking the up - down symmetry in the future .",
    "note that this symmetry has been discussed in the literature  @xcite as a prerequisite for having a free energyin this kind of system .",
    "however , we can add a further coupling proportional to @xmath60 to the hamiltonian ( [ hamsurf ] ) which explicitly destroys up - down symmetry . only in the one - dimensional case",
    "this coupling is a total gradient and therefore vanishes after integration over the full one - dimensional space .",
    "the langevin equation ( [ genlang ] ) now takes the form @xmath61 in the comoving - frame introduced above . to generate correlation and response functions of this stochastic process",
    ", it lends itself to reformulate the langevin equation as a dynamical response functional @xmath62 so that averages can be derived from path integrals with the statistical weight @xmath63 . via introducing a response field @xmath64 , the functional @xmath62 ( in to - discretization ) that we extract with standard methods  @xcite from eqs .",
    "( [ speclang ] ) and ( [ shot - noise ] ) reads @xmath65=\\int d^{d}x\\int dt\\ \\lambda \\big\\{\\tilde{h}\\big(\\lambda^{-1}\\partial_{t}h+\\frac{\\delta\\mathcal{h}_{\\text{surf}}[h]}{\\delta h}\\big)-\\tilde{h}^{2}\\big\\}\\ , , \\label{def_j}\\ ] ] and shows that our driven surface diffusion model obeys detailed balance @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) holds , and all stationary expectation values can be calculated from path - integrals with the statistical weight @xmath66 .    it is a well established fact that in all dynamical field theories that are invariant under a field shift of the type @xmath53 with a constant @xmath54 , the dynamical exponent is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the anomalous scaling exponent of the order parameter field @xmath1 .",
    "as it should , the same applies here .",
    "this can be verified in detail by noting that in the full dynamical field theory based on the response functional  ( [ def_j ] ) one does not need to introduce renormalization factors for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 terms when using minimal renormalization , i.e. , dimensional regularization in conjunction with minimal subtraction .",
    "hence , we can calculate all of the critical exponents of driven surface diffusion with detailed balance from @xmath52 including the dynamical exponent .",
    "an elastic phase transitions is a structural phase transition in which the crystallographic unit cell undergoes an elastic deformation when a normal mode becomes soft in response to the vanishing of an elastic constant or combination of elastic constants . in this section ,",
    "we essentially follow the early work of cowley @xcite , and folk , iro , and schwabl ( fis )  @xcite . for background information on elastic phase transitions ,",
    "we refer to these original papers as well as reviews by bruce and cowley  @xcite , rao and rao  @xcite , and schwabl and tuber @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the order parameter for such a transition is a certain component of the lagrange strain tensor or a linear combination of its components .",
    "depending on the symmetry of a crystal , its lagrange elastic energy density can be unpleasantly complicated even at harmonic order due to the presence of a host of different elastic constants . here , we restrict ourselves to crystals with tetragonal or higher symmetry , i.e. , crystals whose harmonic lagrange energy density can be obtained from the tetragonal case by imposing relations between certain elastic constants . as we will see below ,",
    "crystals with lower symmetry such as orthorhombic or monoclinic symmetry have simple mean field behavior at their respective elastic transition and are hence less interesting from the standpoint of critical phenomena than the higher - symmetry crystals we focus on here .",
    "when generalized to @xmath12 spatial dimensions , the lagrange energy density of tetragonal solids to second order in the strains reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 for a physical solid .",
    "the lagrange strain tensor ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) is defined via the derivatives of the displacement field @xmath74 with respect to the reference space coordinates of the undeformed solid , @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "if we specialize the elastic constants @xmath77 to @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 or @xmath81 , eq .  ( [ fren ] ) reduces to the harmonic energy density of a cubic or hexagonal crystal , respectively .",
    "if all these conditions hold , eq .  ( [ fren ] ) describes an isotropic solid .",
    "moreover , the hexagonal case with the additional relation @xmath82 reduces to the isotropic case after a suitable rescaling of the coordinates .",
    "because of crystal anisotropy , sound velocities depend on the direction of propagation , and modes become soft only in certain selected directions , so - called soft sectors , which may be one- or two - dimensional in 3@xmath12 crystals .",
    "the type of the soft modes depends on which elastic constant or combination of elastic constants vanishes . in the following , we focus on the shear instability that occurs when @xmath4 goes to zero .",
    "the accompanying elastic phase transition is continuous if there are no third order couplings of the corresponding order parameter .",
    "we assume that this is the case .",
    "the upper critical dimension of the phase transition is @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the dimension of the soft mode sector in fourier space , as was shown by fis .",
    "this implies that , from the standpoint of critical phenomena , @xmath85 is the most interesting case since otherwise the upper critical dimension is lower then the physical dimension @xmath86 , and the transition is simply be described by mean - field - theory . in the remainder , we focus on @xmath85 . in this case , the @xmath87-dimensional soft sector is orthogonal to the polarization of the corresponding critical sound waves , i.e. , to the direction of the symmetry - axis in fourier space .",
    "following fis , we radically reduce the displacement field to the critical displacement alone@xmath88 this step is justified if there are no third order couplings in the critical strain .",
    "such couplings can be ruled out on symmetry grounds for the crystals we focus on except for the cubic case . for cubic crystals ,",
    "we assume that third order couplings are absent for some given reason , e.g. , chance .",
    "otherwise , the elastic transition becomes discontinuous .",
    "we will comment on this issue and possible couplings to the non - critical displacements @xmath89 further below .    to figure out which parts of the elastic energy are relevant in the sense of the rg , it is useful to rank the different terms according to the order at which they contribute in the long - wavelength limit . to this end , let us introduce the smallness parameter @xmath90 , and set the derivatives to@xmath91 with the reduction ( [ reduz ] ) , the strain tensor becomes@xmath92 and we obtain the free energy density ( [ fren])@xmath93 where we have set @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "now we see that it is appropriate to rescale the vanishing elastic constant @xmath4 by@xmath96 and reduce @xmath97 to the leading terms proportional to @xmath98:@xmath99 of course , the anisotropic last term in @xmath100 with hypercubic symmetry vanishes in the hexagonal case .    at this stage ,",
    "a comment regarding higher than harmonic terms in the initial lagrange energy density  ( [ fren ] ) is warranted .",
    "as long as we ignore the uncritical displacement @xmath101 , the addition to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fren ] ) of third and fourth order terms in the strains leads to exactly the same form of @xmath102 as given in eq .",
    "( [ redelaen ] ) .",
    "the only effect of the higher order strain terms is to modify the constants decorating the individual terms in eq .",
    "( [ redelaen ] ) , and hence their omission is justified .",
    "however , if we included the noncritical displacements which scale as @xmath103 , then already the harmonic strain terms in the lagrange elastic energy density would lead to couplings of the form @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 which contribute for @xmath107 at the same order in @xmath90 as the terms retained in eq .",
    "( [ redelaen ] ) .",
    "thus far , we only included stretching in our discussion of elastic energy densities . however , since we are interested in the limit @xmath108 where there is an elastic instability , bending terms will be important as they stabilize the crystal .",
    "the bending terms that are relevant here are @xmath109 with @xmath110 in the hexagonal case . adding stretching and bending contributions , we obtain the model elastic energy or hamiltonian @xmath111 which is , up to the anisotropic cubic terms which are absent in the hexagonal case , of the same form as the hamiltonian ( [ hamsurf ] ) for driven surface diffusion . this is the hamiltonian that we will study , after suitable rescalings and renamings , in our renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "form this point on , we will disregard the hyper - cubic terms , i.e. , the last term in the stretching energy density  ( [ redelaen ] ) and the term proportional to @xmath112 in the bending energy density  ( [ redbenden ] ) . as mentioned above , crystals with cubic symmetry are expected to have anomalous scaling behavior and are hence certainly interesting , however , the presence of the hyper - cubic terms makes the diagrammatic perturbation calculation significantly more difficult . though we have done this calculation , we feel that a useful discussion of the cubic case goes beyond the scope of the present paper",

    "thus , this fixed point is stable only in one direction .",

    "( [ fig : flussbild ] ) and can be described as follows : the domain of attraction of the stable fixed point is given by the positive quadrant @xmath197 , @xmath198 , that is bounded by the lines @xmath163 ( gp model ) and @xmath195 ( fis model ) .",
    "the unstable fixed points that correspond to the gp and fis models , respectively , are located on these lines . for negative @xmath156",

    "this suggests that we are dealing with a fluctuation - induced first order transition in the case @xmath199 .",
    "of course , the trivial fixed point @xmath178 is stable for @xmath200 .",
    "thus , for dimensions @xmath201 , we find mean - field behavior .",
    "right at the critical dimension , the mean - field power laws have logarithmic corrections .",
    "this case is of particular importance here because for the elastic phase transitions the upper critical dimension and the physical dimension are the same . in the next section",

    "in this section , we first study the scaling behavior of the cumulants of our theory .",
    "then , we extract from this general result the critical behavior of several experimentally relevant quantities for driven surface diffusion and elastic transitions , respectively .",
    "now , we determine scaling properties of the cumulants @xmath208 . besides the order - parameter - field @xmath209 and its spatial derivatives , we consider the energy - field @xmath210 .",
    "this field is a composite field in the language of renormalization theory with its own scaling behavior .",
    "this scaling behavior can be studied via so - called insertions that are generated by variations @xmath211 of the cumulants with respect to the local temperature@xmath212 .",

    "@xmath224 , @xmath225 or @xmath11 one has to account for additive renormalizations which become essential for the specific heat for @xmath226 .",
    "the additive renormalizations and its consequences are the theme of appendix  [ app : addren ] .",

    "( [ i - l ] ) .      in experiments on surface growth ,",
    "one often measures the roughness of a surface and the associated roughness exponents .",
    "these exponents are defined through the height - height correlation function@xmath229 for surface diffusion , the physical dimension is @xmath230 .",
    "hence , we are interested in the scaling behavior of the height - height correlation and its roughening properties for @xmath177 . the asymptotic solutions of the rg - equations ( [ ampldiff ] ) are@xmath231 where @xmath232 , @xmath233 , and @xmath234 are the values of the rg - functions at the fixed point @xmath235 , @xmath236 . for the stable fixed point as well as for the gp fixed point , we have @xmath237 .",
    "hence we get from the definitions ( [ rgfu ] ) the exact relation@xmath238 the scaling behavior of the height - height correlation function  ( [ hh - corr ] ) can be deduced from the general result ( [ genscal ] ) : @xmath239 where we have defined the anisotropy and the correlation length exponents@xmath240 which are related ( with exception of the fis - model ) by@xmath241 due to the presence of strong anisotropy , we have to dealing with two different roughness exponents @xmath242 and @xmath243 defined by    @xmath244    the two exponents    @xmath245    are read off immediately . in the dimensional - expansion about three surface - dimensions ,",
    "we get@xmath246 to first order in @xmath161 .      as mentioned above , the physical and the upper critical dimensions coincide for elastic transitions .",
    "therefore we have @xmath226 , and we are interested in logarithmic corrections .",
    "the typical measurable quantities are the susceptibility @xmath247 of the critical modes @xmath248 , and the critical part of the specific heat @xmath249 that , as the second line eq .",
    "( [ defspez ] ) indicates , can be calculated from the energy correlation function . here",
    ", we need the asymptotic solutions of the rg - equations ( [ ampldiff ] ) for the amplitudes using the assymtotic flow ( [ asympt ] ) .",
    "we get@xmath250 with the constants @xmath251 and @xmath252 given in eqs .",
    "( [ ampl ] ) and ( [ specampl ] ) . from the general scaling properties of the greens - functions ( [ genscal ] ) and bysetting@xmath253 ( we have set the scale so that @xmath254 to simplify the conclusions )",
    ", we obtain @xmath255 asymptotically .",
    "the correction exponent @xmath256 reads @xmath257 whereas the special models lead to@xmath258 next , using the scaling result for the energy correlations ( [ enkorr ] ) we get @xmath259 with the correction exponent @xmath260 .",
    "we recognize that the term originating from the additive renormalization overwhelms the first one asymptotically .",
    "the correction exponent reads @xmath261 the special models lead to@xmath262    note that our results for the correction exponents for the susceptibility and the specific heat of the fis model are in full agreement with those obtained by fis originally .",
    "hence , our calculation passes an another consistency check .",
    "in summary , we have studied driven surface diffusion at the phase transition from isotropic , edwards - wilkinson type behavior to a state characterized by longitudinal ripples and continuous elastic phase transitions .",
    "we have shown that the two transitions belong under appropriate conditions to the same universality class .",
    "we derived the field theoretic hamiltonian for this universality class which has an upper critical dimension of @xmath263 .",
    "the dimension @xmath12 plays different roles in the two systems . in driven surface diffusion",
    ", @xmath12 is the dimension of the substrate whereas for the elastic phase transition , @xmath12 is the full dimension of space . hence , physically ,",
    "@xmath230 in the former problem and @xmath73 in the latter .",
    "thus , the critical behavior in the surface diffusion problem is described by power laws with anomalous scaling exponents whereas that of the elastic phase transitions under consideration is described by power laws with mean - field exponents decorated by logarithmic corrections .",
    "we calculated these anomalous exponents and logarithmic corrections , respectively , for several experimentally relevant quantities .    as far as elastic phase transitions were concerned , we restricted ourselves to crystals with tetragonal or higher symmetry , i.e. , crystals whose harmonic lagrange energy density can be obtained from the tetragonal case by imposing relations between certain elastic constants because crystals with lower symmetry such as orthorhombic or monoclinic symmetry have simple mean field behavior .",
    "in addition to that , we have left aside crystals with cubic symmetry in the transversal subspace . these do have anomalous scaling behavior , however , the diagrammatic perturbation calculation gets significantly more involved when cubic terms are present and is beyond the scope or the present paper .",
    "we will present our results for the cubic case in a future publication  @xcite .",
    "our model hamiltonian differs from the spj model in that we do not assume tilt invariance and that we do assume detailed balance , at least on a semi - macroscopic scale .",
    "our result for the anisotropy exponent @xmath264 is smaller and those for the roughness exponents are larger than the corresponding 1-loop results produced by the spj model .",
    "hence , in comparison , our model leads to a less anisotropic but slightly rougher surface .",
    "its restriction to detailed balance makes our model a special case of a more general model .",
    "our results , moreover , show that our model corresponds to a rg fixed point of this more general model . whether or not this fixed point is the stable fixed point of the more general model",
    ", we can not judge at this point , and we will address this question in future work .",
    "this question is also important from an experimental standpoint .",
    "if our fixed point turns out being stable , this would mean that the asymptotic behavior in a typical experiment on driven surface diffusion with oblique incidence would show detailed balance as characterized by our fixed point .",
    "our model hamiltonian differs from the fis model in that it includes a relevant third order coupling that does not destroy the continuous character of the transition .",
    "the presence of this term modifies the exponents of the logarithmic corrections to the susceptibility and the specific heat . for the former ,",
    "the difference is quantitative , for the latter it is even qualitative .",
    "the fis model predicts that the specific heat diverges as the transition is approached , whereas we find that it vanishes .",
    "as the fis model , our model entirely neglects the noncritical transversal components of the elastic displacement field . if the order parameter field corresponded directly to a component of the strain tensor , one could simply integrate out the noncritical strain components .",
    "this would produce additional negative contributions to the positive ( on grounds of stability ) fourth order coupling constant of our model .",
    "if the additional negative contributions exceed the positive contribution in magnitude , the transition becomes first order .",
    "however , here we have to integrate out the transversal displacement components and not entire components of the strain tensor .",
    "the transversal components of the displacement are contained together with its critical components in different components of the strain tensor , and it is not clear how to integrate them out .",
    "we will return to the question of the influence of the noncritical displacements in future work .    from a conceptual standpoint , it is worthwhile to reflect on the different roles played by reference and target space symmetries in elastic phase transitions and related problems  @xcite .",
    "invariance under rigid rotations in target space , unless broken by external fields , is a symmetry that applies likewise to any crystal , or for that matter to any elastic system that can be described by lagrange elasticity theory , including smectic liquid crystals , liquid crystal elastomers etc .",
    "reference space symmetry , on the other hand , is determined by the crystallographic point group of a given elastic system .",
    "it has been an established approach for setting up field theoretic models for elastic systems for about three decades to employ gradient expansion and then to retain only those terms that are deemed relevant based on dimensional analysis .",
    "examples where this approach has been used include , to name a few , the original work on nematic liquid crystals by gp , isotropic  @xcite and anisotropic  @xcite tethered membranes , sliding columnar phases  @xcite , nematic elastomers  @xcite and their membranes  @xcite and so on , and we also used this approach here . for systems with comparatively high reference space symmetry ,",
    "vestiges of the target space rotational invariance remain in the final field theoretic hamiltonian .",
    "the nonlinear part of the strain @xmath265 in the gp model , for example , ensures that the target space symmetry is realized at least linearly .",
    "the situation is similar in the other examples just mentioned . for the elastic transition studied in the present paper , with exception of the limiting isotropic case that coincides with the gp model ,",
    "the reference space symmetry is comparatively low , and there are no remains of the target space rotational invariance in the final hamiltonian .",
    "it transpires that the extend to which the latter symmetry survives when setting up field theories depends on the former and that , in a sense , reference space symmetry is superior to target space symmetry .",
    "it is desirable to get a deeper understanding of the interplay of the two symmetries in field theories , and we see here an interesting opportunity for future work .",
