    "the discovery @xcite of afterglows to long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) showed them to occur in star - forming galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "many aspects of the observed grb behaviour could be explained reasonably well by the relativistic fireball models , in which the prompt emission is largely produced by shocks internal to the outflow , and the long - lived afterglow by the outflow impacting and shocking the external ambient medium @xcite .",
    "however , it was early appreciated that if they emitted isotropically then the radiative energies implied for some bursts would be very large ( in excess of a solar rest mass in the case of grb990123 , for example ; @xcite ) .",
    "since no known mechanism can produce high - energy photons with efficiency approaching 100% , the total explosive energy required would be even greater , implausibly large for a stellar core - collapse powered event .",
    "the energetics argument led to the expectation that the grb outflow must be confined to a jet , reducing the overall energy requirements . in that case",
    "a sufficiently massive core collapsing to a black - hole might produce an outflow which could pierce a hydrogen - stripped envelope to still produce a relativistic jet @xcite .",
    "this picture received support from the observation of concurrent supernova events at grb sites for some ( low - redshift ) low - luminosity bursts @xcite .",
    "the class of grb - supernovae could be explained by the explosion of a wolf - rayet star , and it has been widely assumed that this progenitor must account for most if not all long - grbs .",
    "a strong prediction of all collimated models is that the observed light curve should exhibit an achromatic break , visible in both optical and x - ray light curves , when the relativistic outflow slows to the point that the doppler beaming angle becomes wider than the opening angle of the jet @xcite : the later the break time , the wider the jet . in the pre-_swift _",
    "era a number of bursts with good afterglow observations showed breaks in the optical , at times ranging from a few hours to a few days .",
    "furthermore , it was contended that the implied jet opening angles anti - correlated with the isotropic - equivalent @xmath5-ray energies @xmath6 @xcite  in other words , corrected for collimation nearly all bursts seemed to be accessing a rather standard energy reservoir ( to within about an order of magnitude ) , potentially usable as standard candles at high redshift . while the total rotational energies available from a collapsing core may be of order 10@xmath7 erg , the maximal extraction of energy is unlikely to exceed 10@xmath810@xmath9 erg @xcite . with this in mind , the standard energy reservoir with energies of @xmath1010@xmath8 erg appeared very attractive .",
    "unfortunately the x - ray data available pre-_swift _ only provided definitive evidence of ( single ) breaks for a few bursts .",
    "one of the expectations of _ swift _ was that many more bursts would be seen with clear breaks in the x - ray coincident with optical breaks .",
    "after more than four years of operations this is not what has been found .",
    "in fact , the situation is much more confusing , with x - ray light curves exhibiting complex behaviour including flares and plateaux @xcite .",
    "when late breaks ( beyond a few hours ) are seen they rarely coincide in time or degree with optical breaks , and are hard to reconcile with simple fireball model predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though there are notable exceptions .",
    "it is possible that from x - ray data alone a number of jet breaks , particularly those at late times or those which turn over rather smoothly , may go undetected through misinterpretation of their light curves .",
    "these so - called ` hidden ' breaks may be revealed on comparison of x - ray light curves with optical light curves @xcite , but the emphasis remains on x - ray light curves for break detection owing to the large numbers of well - sampled x - ray light curves now available .    most crucially ,",
    "in many grbs no temporal break is seen at all to late times , implying much more energy than expected .",
    "the most extreme example to - date is that of grb060729 , which continued a smooth x - ray power - law decline for 125 d , implying an opening angle greater than 28 degrees @xcite .",
    "this source continues to be monitored in the x - rays with _",
    "chandra _ and was still detected one year after the grb event ( grupe et al .",
    "the light curve now shows a possible break at @xmath10290 d : the nature of this break is not yet known .",
    "while the modest luminosity and low redshift of grb060729 ( @xmath11 erg , @xcite ) make it unsuitable to test collapsar models to their limits , such observations provide a crucial guide to further theoretical developments . if such high collimation - corrected energies continue to be inferred , then the situation looks bleak for simple core - collapse models as the explanation for the high - luminosity long - grbs .",
    "in fact , it would suggest a different progenitor is required for high- and low - luminosity long - bursts .",
    "on the other hand , if late breaks are seen , although the jet model is not proven this could provide evidence for an upper envelope to the energy tapped by grbs which may still be consistent with that available in principle from core - collapse , but would require a new understanding of how such high efficiencies of radiative emission could be achieved .",
    "in this paper we follow a high redshift grb with a high isotropic energy out to late times to search for a jet break and thereby measure the total energy budget of the prompt @xmath5-ray emission . in section 2",
    "we describe the @xmath5-ray , x - ray and optical observations and analyses .",
    "we derive the grb fluence in section 3 . in section 4",

    "onwards , we measure an x - ray decay of @xmath36 ( table [ table : lcfit ] ) .",
    "this is interestingly and significantly different from the @xmath37 found when we fit the whole dataset from 430  s onwards ( in which a single break is best fitted at 0.02  d ) , and indicates a change in slope which is not obvious when combined with earlier data .",
    "fitting the optical and x - ray decay indices independently rather than tied shows a difference of only @xmath38 , while any difference owing to a so - called cooling break ( see the following section ) between optical and x - rays should be @xmath39 in the fireball model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we thus conclude there is no such spectral break in this scenario .",
    "the question arises as to which of the two fits is actually better : the one containing data from 430  s onwards ( smoothly broken power law ) , or the one with data only after 0.5  d ( single power law ) . for this",
    ", we calculate the final @xmath40 value , only for the data past 0.5  d , for both fits .",
    "that is , the fits themselves are still done by minimizing @xmath40 calculated from the full applicable data range ( post 430 s and post 0.5  d , respectively ) , but we compare @xmath40 calculated by using only data past 0.5  d for each fit ( where likely only a power law applies ) .",
    "the @xmath40/dof for the smoothly broken power law in this case is rather bad , 111.1/55 , compared to 55.3/58 for a power law only .",
    "this would indicate that the relatively good total @xmath40 value for the smoothly broken power law fit arises largely from the early data between 430  s and 0.5  d. this could be the case if errors in the early section are slightly overestimated .",
    "it could also indicate a second break at x - ray wavelengths in this interval , which would account for the difference in final power law decays ( @xmath41 of 1.6 versus 1.4 ) .",
    "such a break would , however , increase the complexity of the underlying light curve model , and may make it more difficult to interpret the results .",
    "lastly , we could also be seeing effects from fitting a smoothly broken power law , where the second decay index is the actual final decay index , and thus may not be equal to the decay index measured along a small portion of the light curve ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we now investigate whether or not the data are consistent with the fireball model predictions .",
    "we use the closure relations ( found in , e.g. , table 1 of @xcite ) relating the optical and x - ray spectral and temporal slopes to determine how this grb afterglow may fit into the standard fireball model . in section 4.2",
    "we have performed the same light curve fits to two subsets of the data : one beginning at 430  s since the grb and one beginning 0.5  d since the grb , with two different outcomes . following the reasoning in the last paragraph of section 4.2",
    ", we examine the results obtained from fitting the data from 0.5  d to a single power law .",
    "the late - time temporal fits show that the slopes are essentially the same in the x - ray and optical bands , with @xmath42 , which indicates that both observing bands are in the same spectral regime , either both below or above the cooling break . in the case where they are both below the cooling break and the circumburst medium is homogeneous , the value of @xmath43 can be derived to be @xmath44 from @xmath45 ( well within the range of previously found values , @xcite ) , and the predicted temporal slope is @xmath46 , which is consistent with the observed value .",
    "a stellar - wind - like medium or a scenario in which both the optical and x - ray bands are situated above the cooling frequency can be ruled out by the standard closure relations between the spectral and temporal indices .",
    "the value for the x - ray spectral index , however , is somewhat at odds with the estimated @xmath47 , if there is no supposed break across the @xmath47 range .",
    "host galaxy extinction may mean the intrinsic optical magnitudes are brighter than those observed , allowing an increase in @xmath47 , which could resolve this apparent discrepancy . to investigate this",
    ", we can combine the @xmath48 optical photometry ( table [ optdata ] ) with an x - ray spectrum to estimate extinction from the broadband spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the case that @xmath49 .",
    "the sed , centred at 1.725  d , was created and fitted via the method outlined in @xcite and adopts a single absorbed power law as the underlying model and small magellanic cloud - like host galaxy extinction .",
    "we find that extinction is required at the level of @xmath50 , corresponding to @xmath51 magnitudes .",
    "this value is one of the highest measured for a grb host galaxy @xcite , but such measurements are made only for grbs with detected optical afterglows and presumably extinction is much higher in the optically undetected dark bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for completeness we performed the same tests on the best - fitting smoothly broken power law model to the data from 430  s onwards .",
    "we find that the power law index of the electron energy distribution , @xmath43 , derived from the light curve predicts harder spectral indices than are observed .",
    "we investigated the possibility of an additional spectral component , caused by inverse compton ( ic ) emission , which would harden the spectrum ( as also proposed for e.g. grb990123 , @xcite and grb000926 , @xcite ) .",
    "following the equations in @xcite and @xcite , we find that the closure relations for the temporal and spectral indices still can not be satisfied .",
    "we note that in this scenario the break at 0.02 d may be considered an early jet break .",
    "there are two arguments against attribution of this feature to the jet break .",
    "firstly , after a jet break the temporal slopes are given by @xmath52 , regardless of whether the observing frequency is above or below the cooling frequency , so the optical and x - ray temporal slopes should be the same .",
    "this is not the case for this dataset .",
    "secondly , if this feature were a jet break it would imply an opening angle of 0.44@xmath53 ( calculated using the equations in the following section ) , far smaller than most previously determined values ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also @xcite ) .    concluding , the results from fits to the late - time only data indicate that both observing bands are in the same spectral regime and in order to correctly predict the x - ray spectral slope the jet must be traversing a homogeneous medium . the difference between the optical - to - x - ray spectral index and the x - ray spectral slope is not predicted , but could be explained by the invocation of host galaxy extinction of @xmath54",
    ". the results from using the full range of data can not be satisfactorily described by the fireball model and/or with an early jet break , and it is likely that in this case a single smoothly broken power law model is not applicable .",
    "these data have shown that a late - time temporal break at x - ray or optical wavelengths is not required .",
    "we can therefore use the latest observation time as a lower limit to any jet break time , and calculate the required limits on opening angle and total energy budget for the grb jet . to calculate the isotropic energy @xmath6 we use the following equation @xmath55 adopting the values listed in sections 2 and 3 ( @xmath31 , fluence @xmath56 erg @xmath19 ) and a luminosity distance @xmath57 of 6.5@xmath110@xmath58 cm ( where @xmath59 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , adopted in order to compare our value with the sample of @xcite ) .",
    "we find @xmath62 erg .",
    "we have not included a @xmath63  correction , because the energy range used encompasses the peak energy , and the measured fluence should be sufficiently close to the bolometric fluence erg @xmath19 corresponding to @xmath64 erg ] .    using this value for @xmath6",
    "we can go on to calculate an upper limit on the jet opening angle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since no jet break is seen up to our last _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "this is assuming we may apply the fireball model for the case of a uniform jet ( see section 5 for further discussion of this ) .",
    "@xmath65    adopting typical values for efficiency and density of @xmath66 and @xmath67  @xmath68 , we find @xmath69 radians or ( @xmath70 .",
    "+ the lower limit on the total energy budget in @xmath5-rays for the grb is then obtained from the following equation which accounts for jet collimation using the newly derived jet opening angle upper limit , @xmath71 which gives @xmath72 erg , or more conservatively taking the lower limit for @xmath6 then @xmath73 erg using the end of the final _ xmm - newton _ observation ( 36.08 d or 3.12@xmath110@xmath2  s ) as our lower limit on any jet break time .",
    "we have followed the afterglow of the high @xmath6 , relatively high redshift grb080721 to beyond 10@xmath2  s at both x - ray and optical wavelengths .",
    "the late - time decay is well fitted with a single power law with no requirement for a break .",
    "this suggests that the jet break must lie beyond the detection limits of the intruments used , and from this we calculate a lower limit to the total prompt @xmath5-ray energy of the grb of @xmath73 erg and to the jet opening angle of @xmath74 .",
    "this relies on the assumption that the fireball model describes the physics of the jet , the jet is uniform in structure , and that the standard values for surrounding density and efficiency of energy conversion are applicable .",
    "we note that the dependence of the total energy on these latter two parameters is very weak ( equation 2 ) .",
    "we have compared the closure relations from the fireball model with the observed temporal and spectral slopes .",
    "the model and the observations can not be reconciled for the whole dataset , with departures from the model at early times ( before half a day ) , and different temporal slopes are derived depending on whether data before 0.5  d are included in the fit . it is likely that additional components combine with the afterglow emission at the onset of the afterglow , rendering the fireball model inapplicable , but at what time the afterglow begins to dominate is not known .",
    "this illustrates the difficulties of pinning down the details of the blastwave physics even when broad - band well - sampled data are available .",
    "the data either from 0.5  d or from 430  s onwards require that the grb jets traverse a homogeneous circumburst medium .",
    "the apparent inconsistency between the x - ray spectral index and the optical to x - ray spectral index may be caused by extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "we have also investigated the alternative scenario in which an earlier break in the light curve at @xmath100.02  d is the jet break , and found that this can not work within the fireball model .",
    "if we assume the fireball model , and therefore that one of the measured observational parameters is contaminated ( perhaps by an additional component or incorrect other assumption ) , the implied jet opening angle would be very small ( 0.44@xmath53 ) for a grb ( or indeed any known jet source ) .",
    "such collimation can not be explained by any current models and the chances of the narrow jet happening upon our line - of - sight are small .",
    "we do not prefer this scenario for these reasons , but we note that this explanation has been the preferred model for some other grbs which we discuss in section 7.3 . in the following subsection we summarise the main classes of long grb progenitor models , and discuss whether any of these can reach energies 10@xmath9 erg and beyond .      in the collapsar scenario , two different ways to extract energy to make a grb",
    "are suggested in the literature , one using neutrinos and the other harnessing magnetic fields .    in the neutrino - driven model ,",
    "the energy that can be extracted depends sensitively on the accretion rate of collapsing material onto the newly formed black hole through the accretion disc and on the kerr parameter describing the rotation of the black hole , as seen in table 3 of popham et al .",
    "( 1999 ; see also @xcite ) . for typical long grb durations ( tens to hundreds of seconds ) a grb total energy of 10@xmath9  erg is certainly possible within this model particularly for fast rotation rates .",
    "the observational testing of such models depends , therefore , not on measurements of grb total energies but on determination of the rotation and mass accretion rates . according to the recent grb progenitor models by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a lower metallicity star is preferred for a higher kerr parameter . @xcite and @xcite introduced models of chemically homogeneous evolution which produces helium stars with little or no hydrogen envelope that are metal - poor fast - rotators , and",
    "can therefore go on to form a grb .",
    "the complexities of stellar evolution are not all well understood , and make the determination of grb progenitors a difficult undertaking .",
    "however , the identification of the crucial role of metallicity opens up an avenue for observational constraints . we can measure the metallicity of the circumburst medium or host galaxy along the line - of - sight to grbs through afterglow spectroscopy , and for most long grbs metallicities of order a tenth the solar value have been inferred from this method @xcite , with the lowest measured value being @xmath75 solar for grb050730 @xcite though lines are often saturated hence likely to provide only lower limits on the metallicity @xcite .",
    "we can measure the metallicity , @xmath76 , of the environment of grb080721 from the column densities of neutral hydrogen ( hi ly@xmath77 ) and singly ionised silicon ( siii @xmath781808  ) in absorption ( fig . [ optspec ] ) of [ si / h]@xmath23 - 1.1 .",
    "all the other observed spectral lines are likely to be saturated , hence we have used the weakest detected metal line .",
    "this equates to @xmath79 times the solar value , within the typical distribution for grbs .",
    "while this should strictly be treated as a lower limit due to possible saturation of the siii @xmath781808   line , saturation is likely to be moderate at most and , therefore , the actual metallicity of the absorber should be of the order of one tenth of solar , unless significant dust depletion effects are at play ( as silicon is a mildly refractory element ) .",
    "if the metallicity is significantly lower than 0.1 solar , the kerr parameter may be close to @xmath80 @xcite , and an energy of 1@xmath110@xmath9 erg could be easily achieved according to the calculations of @xcite . a high metallicity could be an indication of large initial stellar masses , or simply that the models are not applicable .",
    "the magnetic - field - driven model uses the blandford - znajek mechanism to extract rotation energy from the black hole @xcite .",
    "this idea is indeed supported by the recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the energies that can be extracted are up to 10@xmath7 erg at 100% efficiency .",
    "typical efficiencies are likely to be far lower than this ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with 1% efficiency the lower limit on total energy of grb080721 can be accommodated . here again the kerr parameter is an important factor in determining the available energy , in which case lower metallicity progenitor stars may be preferable .",
    "interestingly , the measured energy limit for grb080721 is comparable to the energy budget in the magnetar scenario @xcite , where the extraction of the rotational energy of a millisecond pulsar by strong magnetic fields is suggested @xcite . the magnetar scenario for long grbs",
    "has received renewed interest in recent observational works , where it has been suggested to explain some plateau phases and very steep x - ray declines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* specifically in e.g. grb070110 , @xcite ) .",
    "the claim of an 8  s periodicity in the highest energy bands for grb090709a suggests association with a magnetar for this source @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction for the upper limit on the energy of a maximally rotating neutron star is few@xmath110@xmath9 erg @xcite , and we note that @xmath1010@xmath9 erg is the lower limit we derive for this grb implying very high efficiency close to 100% .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is unlikely that grb080721 is produced via magnetar formation .",
    "the implied total energy for grb080721 based on the lower limit calculated here is not only a challenge to some progenitor models , but is a rare occurrence among grbs .",
    "we have compared this limit to the energies measured from detections of jet breaks in a _",
    "swift _ sample of grbs published by @xcite in fig .",
    "[ egammaeisoswift ] .",
    "the lower limit for grb080721 is much larger than any energy measured from a jet break in this sample . comparing this source with the amati relation @xcite",
    "we see that it falls at the high @xmath81@xmath6 end of the correlation , in a continuation of the long grb population out to the most energetic sources .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations have enabled a longer baseline for jet searches and this source was chosen specifically for its unusually high isotropic energy .     ",
    "log @xmath82 ( upper ) and log @xmath83 ",
    "log @xmath6 ( lower ) plots for _ swift _ long grbs with jet breaks or possible jet breaks ( taken from table 2 of @xcite ; redshifts may be spectroscopic , photometric or from host association ) .",
    "jet break time is given in the observer frame .",
    "the arrows in the upper right of each plot show the limits set here on grb080721.,width=170 ]    grb061007 @xcite was also a highly energetic grb with an isotropic energy of 1@xmath110@xmath7 erg @xcite .",
    "the closure relations for this source were also not entirely satisfied and no spectral evolution was found from 80  s to 3.1  d after the trigger .",
    "the high implied total energy , in both the wind and homogeneous medium cases considered in @xcite led the authors to conclude that an early jet break must have occurred , before t@xmath84 + 80  s , which implies a highly collimated outflow with opening angle @xmath85@xmath86 , four times smaller than any determined previously .",
    "this scenario , which we investigated for grb080721 in section 5 and subsequently ruled out , requires that the narrow jet happens to lie along our line - of - sight , may be supported by the rarity of such non - evolving afterglows and the unusually high initial optical brightness for grb061007 .",
    "however , we discussed long grb progenitor models in the previous section for which the large energies measured both for grb061007 and in this paper for grb080721 when assuming a very late , unobserved jet break with a more typical jet opening angle , are in fact achievable .",
    "another case for which the observations implied a high energy budget , while the standard fireball model was a poor description of the afterglow , was grb080319b @xcite .",
    "this collapsar scenario for this long grb is , however , supported by the detection of a supernova signature @xcite . to explain the complex afterglow behaviour , not smooth and featureless in this case but appearing to have a number of components including an initially extremely bright optical counterpart , @xcite introduced a second jet",
    "this 2-jet model consisted of an inner jet with @xmath82  =  0.03  d and opening angle 0.2@xmath53 and an outer jet more typical of grbs with @xmath82  =  11.6  d and opening angle 4@xmath53 .",
    "double and even triple jet systems are occasionally invoked when single jet models simply can not explain the observations ( e.g. grb030329 , berger et al .",
    "2003 ; grb021004 , starling et al . 2005a ; grb050401 , kamble et al . 2009 ; grb050802 , oates et al .",
    "2007 , de pasquale et al . 2009 ) , and while it is likely to be more physical to assume some structure across the jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the interaction of multiple jets is not well known .",
    "we have observed the bright , highly energetic afterglow of grb080721 out to 36 days since the trigger in the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "we conclude that no jet break is present in the late - time light curve and we rule out a jet - break origin for the early light curve break , inferring a limit on the opening angle of @xmath74 and setting constraints on the total energy budget of the burst of @xmath87 erg within the fireball model . to obey the fireball model closure relations the grb jet must be expanding into a homogeneous medium and be extincted in the optical bands by approximately 0.6 magnitudes .",
    "the energy constraint we derive can be used as observational input for models of the progenitors of long gamma - ray bursts .",
    "we can likely rule out a magnetar progenitor for this grb as this would require close to 100% efficiency to reach the observed total energy .",
    "such high collimation - corrected energies could be accommodated with certain parameters of the standard massive star core - collapse models .",
    "one of the key observational parameters in distinguishing between various core - collapse models is the metallicity , diagnostic only if it lies outside of the typical range of @xmath88 .",
    "the metallicity we measure for grb080721 unfortunately does not allow a distinction between models to be made .",
    "the occurrence of such highly energetic or narrowly beamed grbs is rather rare , and for those which have the required measurements to allow a study such as this one on grb080721 we estimate there may be a handful per year among the 100130 well localised grbs currently triggering operational satellites .",
    "measurement of the high energy spectral peak , securing the redshift and monitoring the light curves for as long as possible ( preferably in multiple bands ) are all crucial , and these data have shown that a full understanding of the blastwave physics can be difficult to achieve even with a good quality , well - sampled , broad - band dataset . to determine whether these sources are true outliers from the grb population , perhaps requiring different or more extreme progenitors , will require dedicated efforts to build up small samples to compare with each other and with the growing database of more typical grbs .",
