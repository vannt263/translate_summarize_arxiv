    "the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) unification scenario has been successful for explaining different types of active galaxies @xcite . in the unification model ,",
    "type 1 and type 2 agns are believed intrinsically the same but viewed from different orientations , and the absence of broad emission lines ( bels ) in type 2 agns is due to the obscuration by an optically thick structure ( dusty torus ) from our line of sight .",
    "the most convincing evidence supporting the unified model is the detection of polarized bels in seyfert 2 galaxies by spectropolarimetric observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray observations also support the unified scenario by detecting typically larger absorption column densities @xmath3 in type 2 agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , a fraction of seyfert 2 agns were reported to show no or very low x - ray absorption ( with @xmath4 ) @xcite , apparently in contrast to the standard unification model .",
    "possible explanations to these  x - ray unabsorbed seyfert 2 \" include :    \\1 ) they appear  unabsorbed \" in x - ray due to contamination from the host galaxy , or a scattering component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "\\2 ) weak / absent blrs in low luminosity or low accretion rate sources @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) state transitions and non - simultaneous x - ray and optical observations , i.e. , the absence of broad emission lines could be due to a very low state in the central engine ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray absorption was also found variable rapidly in some sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "\\4 ) extremely high dust to gas ratio ( or expressed as e@xmath5/n@xmath6 or a@xmath7/n@xmath6 ) compared with the galactic value .",
    "however this is in contradiction with observations that @xcite measured e@xmath5/n@xmath6 of 3  100 times lower than galactic for obscured agns at intermediate and high luminosities .",
    "iras f01475 - 0740 was identified as a seyfert 2 galaxy at @xmath8 by @xcite with the 2.15-m casleo telescope in argentina .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of polarized broad emission lines in iras f01475 - 0740 , indicating the existence of a hidden blr .",
    "iras f01475 - 0740  was identified as x - ray unabsorbed based on xmm - newton observation .",
    "@xcite announced that the x - ray spectra observed by xmm - newton in 2004 showed low x - ray absorption ( @xmath9 ) . as noted by brightman & nandra ( 2008 ) , such low x - ray absorption is insufficient to suppress the optical broad lines unless unless the absorber has an anomalously high dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "they instead proposed that iras f01475 - 0740  is heavily obscured and its x - ray  unabsorbed \" appearance is due to a scattering component by the electrons which also scatter broad optical emission lines .",
    "in this paper we present a new suzaku observation on iras f01475 - 0740  taken in 2008 , in which we detect significant and rapid x - ray variations at time scale down to 5 ks .",
    "such rapid variations , which were not seen during previous xmm exposure , provide strong constraint to the x - ray absorption nature of iras f01475 - 0740 .",
    "iras f01475 - 0740  was observed with suzaku on july 14th , 2008 for a net xis exposure time of 57.9 ks ( obsid 703065010 ) .",
    "we reprocessed the xis 0,1,3 data from the unfiltered event files . in this letter",
    "we focus on xis data only since iras f01475 - 0740  was non - detected by hxd - pin .",
    "all the data reduction followed the standard procedure illustrated in the suzaku reduction guide .",
    "the most recent calibration released on 2010 november 04 and the analysis software package heasoft 6.10 were used .",
    "we examined the xis 0.42 kev and 210 kev images from cleaned event files and find no contamination from nearby sources .",
    "this is also confirmed in the xmm image . to extract xis spectra",
    ", we combined the @xmath10 and @xmath11 modes for each ccd .",
    "the source spectra were extracted from circular regions with radius of 3.0 , and the background from larger circular regions excluding the source and avoiding the calibration sources in corners .",
    "the response and ancillary response files were created finally using @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in this paper the spectra of xis0 and xis3 ( both are front - illuminated ) were always added with @xmath14 , and fitted simultaneously with the spectrum of xis1 ( back - illuminated ) . in the spectral fitting",
    ", we chosed 0.4 - 10 kev band for xis0+xis3 spectrum , and 0.4 - 8 kev band for xis1 ( due to its much lower effective area at higher energy ) .",
    "the 1.5  2.0 kev spectra were excluded because of calibration uncertainty due to the si k edge @xcite .",
    "fitting errors are of @xmath15 confidence level for one parameter ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "an additional soft component ( @xmath23 in xspec with @xmath24 kev ) is statistically required .",
    "such a soft component could be due to emission from the host galaxy , or due to a soft excess from the agn ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "narrow iron @xmath25 line was non - detected , and we provide the upper limit in table 1 to its equivalent width by fixing the line width @xmath26 at 0.02 kev and central energy at 6.4 kev .",

    "the amplitude of the variation is much larger than the background count rate , thus the rapid variation can not be due to the variation in instrumental background .    to investigate for spectral variation , we extract x - ray spectra in three time intervals signed high / middle / low state in fig .",
    "we fit them separately with the @xmath23 component fixed to the best - fit model of the whole exposure , and the fitting results are given in table 1 .",
    "iras f01475 - 0740 was also observed by xmm - newton in january 2004 .",
    "we reprocessed the spectra of pn and mos as @xcite and the fitting results with the same model are also included in table 1 .",
    "we note that xmm fluxes are consistent with suzaku low state .",
    "we saw no significant variation in spectral shape ( photon index or absorption ) within suzaku exposure or between suzaku and xmm observations .",
    "this indicates that the rapid x - ray variation is intrinsic , and can not be attributed to variation in absorption , as detected in several other sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note that a rapid x - ray variation in iras f01475 - 0740  was also detected during rosat pspc exposure on july 13th , 1992 .",
    "@xcite found its rosat count rate in the 0.22 kev band decreased from 0.064 to 0.021 counts / s within 12.9 hours , with the amplitude of the variation similar to suzaku data .",
    "we first note that the rapid x - ray variation in iras f01475 - 0740  is unlikely due to contamination from a nearby x - ray source , which must have comparable but variable x - ray flux , and locate close to iras f01475 - 0740  by coincidence .",
    "the rosat pspc image obtained in 1992 has better resolution ( 25@xmath27 at 1 kev ) than suzaku ( 1.6@xmath28 ) .",
    "on pspc image we clearly see a single point source at the position of iras f01475 - 0740 , without contamination from nearby sources within 4@xmath28 .",
    "the xmm mos images obtained in 2004 have the best spatial resolution ( 6@xmath27 fwhm ) in x - ray available for iras f01475 - 0740 .",
    "although xmm data revealed no variation @xcite , no nearby sources were detected within 4@xmath28 , and iras f01475 - 0740  remained point - like during the exposure .",
    "these indicate that , if there is any nearby source which is responsible for the detected rapid variation during rosat and suzaku observations , either its distance to iras f01475 - 0740  is too small ( @xmath29 6@xmath27 ) to be resolved by xmm mos , or it could locate at a larger distance ( @xmath29 25 , still unresolvable with rosat pspc though ) but totally disappear during xmm exposure . the x - ray source number density with f@xmath30 above 1 @xmath31 10@xmath32 2s  provided by asca large sky survey is 0.5 deg@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this means that the possibility to have another x - ray bright source within 25  to iras f01475 - 0740  by chance is 0.00015 .",
    "the possibility further drops to 9 @xmath31 10@xmath34 for a distance of 6 .",
    "we also note that the observed luminosity l@xmath30 varies from 1.7 to 0.5 @xmath31 10@xmath35 erg s@xmath36 during suzaku exposure .",
    "such luminosity is too high for an off - nuclear ultra luminous x - ray source ( ulx ) located in iras f01475 - 0740  @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated a mass of 10@xmath37 for the super - massive black hole ( smbh ) in the nucleus of iras f01475 - 0740 ( deduced from the mass of bulge ) .",
    "for such a smbh , the observed time scale of rapid x - ray variation ( 5 ks ) corresponds to @xmath38 70 r@xmath39 ( r@xmath39 = 2gm / c@xmath40 ) .",
    "this is far smaller than the sizes of the blr , the torus , and the region of scattering electrons .",
    "the rapid and significant x - ray variation detected in iras f01475 - 0740  thus proves that we were viewing its central engine directly ( without significant contribution to x - ray flux from the host galaxy ) , and the fitted small x - ray absorption column density is physical instead of polluted by emission from host galaxy or scattering / reflection component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the small iron @xmath25 ew and the x - ray to reddening - corrected [ oiii ] flux ratio ( @xmath41}$ ] = 1  3 ) are consistent with ( e.g. do not oppose ) its compton - thin identity @xcite .",
    "note that based on the @xmath42 versus @xmath43}/f_{ir}$ ] plot , @xcite also classified iras f01475 - 0740  as compton - thin with x - ray emission dominated by agn process .    in  1 we have listed possible explanations for  x - ray unabsorbed s2 \" galaxies .",
    "the first of them , i.e. , due to contamination from host galaxy or scattering / reflection component in x - ray , can thus be ruled out based the detected rapid x - ray variation .",
    "the second one , i.e. , intrinsically weak / lack of blr in low luminosity or low accretion rate sources is not applicable either .",
    "this is because that polarized broad emission line has been detected @xcite .",
    "we further note that the luminosity and accretion rate of iras f01475 - 0740  ( with l@xmath30 = 0.5  1.7 @xmath31 10@xmath35 erg s@xmath36 , l@xmath44}$ ] = 5 @xmath31 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath36 , and an eddington ratio of 0.28 ) emission ( see wang & zhang 2007 ) . assuming a 10 - 200 correction factor from 2 - 10 kev to bolometric luminosity @xcite , the eddington ratio for this object is @xmath46 . ]",
    "are consistent with those type 2 agns with hidden blr detected @xcite .",
    "below we discuss the rest two possibilities .      in this sub - section",
    "we examine whether there were state transitions in iras f01475 - 0740 .",
    "we obtained a new optical spectrum with the naoc ( national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences ) 2.16 m telescope on 21st july , 2010 .",
    "the spectrum with a resolution of 9.6  is plotted in fig .",
    "4 , in which no broad components of the permit lines were detected .",
    "the detected narrow balmer decrement is consistent with @xcite ( the number in brackets is from de grijp et al . ) : @xmath47 ( 7.19 ) .",
    "we convert the balmer decrement to optical reddening using the formula of @xcite : @xmath48 , and obtained an optical extinction @xmath49 for the narrow line region .",
    "the reddening to the narrow line region corresponds to an x - ray absorption column density of @xmath50 ( assuming a galactic dust to gas ratio with @xmath51 , * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that the observed x - ray absorption is only sufficient for the reddening to nlr assuming a galactic dust to gas ratio .",
    "the lack of broad emission lines in the optical spectra obviously requires much higher reddening .",
    "@xcite reported rosat pspc spectrum of iras f01475 - 0740  obtained in july 1992 with a total integrated exposure time of 6.9 ks .",
    "the pspc flux in 0.1  2 kev is 4.6 @xmath31 @xmath522s , similar to the soft x - ray flux detected by suzaku ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we conclude that based on the optical spectra ( one in march 1993 and one in july 2010 ) , and the consistent x - ray unabsorbed appearance and/or fluxes detected by rosat ( july 1992 ) , xmm ( jan . 2004 ) and suzaku ( july 2008 ) respectively , the state transition scenario is unlikely for iras f01475 - 0740 .",
    "simultaneously x - ray and optical data are required though to completely rule out this scenario .    alternatively , the absorber in iras f01475 - 0740  could be clumpy , and the low x - ray n@xmath6 could be due to lower column density holes in the absorber . however , this is unlikely either since while the non - detection of broad emission lines in optical spectra needs almost complete coverage of the absorber to the blr , consistent low n@xmath6 detected by multiple x - ray observations requires the absorber to be quite clumpy ( that we have higher chance to view the central engine in x - ray through low column density holes ) .",
    "spectral fitting to suzaku data also indicates that partial covering absorption is statistically not required ( @xmath53 @xmath29 1 ) .",
    "the only possibility left is that the absorption material in iras f01475 - 0740  has abnormally high dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "based on the new optical spectrum we obtained with naoc 2.16 m telescope , we derived an upper limit to the broad h@xmath54 to narrow [ nii ] 6583 line flux ratio of 0.14 ( assuming the broad h@xmath54 has a fwhm of 5000 km / s ) .",
    "this upper limit is 180 time lower than the typical value in seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "this requires an extra extinction of a@xmath7 @xmath2 6.9 ( assuming a galactic extinction curve ) to the hidden broad line region , in additional to @xmath49 to the narrow line region .",
    "consequently the dust to gas ratio in iras f01475 - 0740  is at least @xmath384 times larger than galactic .",
    "however , such high dust - to - gas ratio is rather unusual among agns .",
    "@xcite report that while e@xmath5/n@xmath6 in low luminosity agns ( with l@xmath55 @xmath38 10@xmath45 erg s@xmath36 ) could be several times higher than the galactic , agns with l@xmath55 @xmath2 10@xmath35 erg s@xmath36 have e@xmath5/n@xmath6 lower than galactic by a factor of 3  100 .",
    "note that absorption in agns with dust - to - gas ratio consistent with galactic were also reported ( e.g. wang et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the x - ray luminosity of iras f01475 - 0740 ( l@xmath56 erg s@xmath36 ) is right on the border between low luminosity sources with e@xmath5/n@xmath6 higher than galactic and high luminosity sources with e@xmath5/n@xmath6 lower than galactic in @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that dusty warm absorber could exist in the quasar iras 13349 + 2438 , to explain the lack of x - ray cold absorption in contradiction with strong optical reddening .",
    "several similar cases were later reported @xcite . to examine",
    "whether the absorber in iras f01475 - 0740  is also ionized , we fit the suzaku spectra with an ionized absorption model @xmath57 .",
    "we find that warm absorption is statistically not required .",
    "x - ray absorption edges due to ionized gas or dust were non - detected either in suzaku or xmm spectra .",
    "we finally note that iras f01475 - 0740  also appears peculiar in infrared spectrum .",
    "it is the only seyfert 2 galaxy with mid - ir silicate emission in the spitzer sample of @xcite .",
    "this makes it more like a type 1 agn , suggesting smaller dust absorption opacity in ir comparing with other seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this is however consistent with the small x - ray absorption detected , suggesting that the dust might be dominated by small grains which could steepen the optical / ir extinction curve .",
    "broad emission lines are expected to be detectable in near - ir spectra for absorber with small column density @xcite .",
    "deep near - ir and optical spectra are essential to detect the reddened broad emission line and measure the abnormal dust extinction .                                  , s. 1999 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol .",
