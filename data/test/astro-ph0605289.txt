    "recently , a number of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath2 have been found , and their photometric properties and spatial distribution have been studied extensively .",
    "studies have been made on a uv luminosity function ( uvlf ) as well as a star formation rate ( sfr ) density at the epoch and on a two - point correlation function which constrains the mass of the dark halo where a lbg ( or lbgs ) resides .",
    "furthermore , analysis of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) has constrained their stellar masses , ages , degree of extinction , and so on for the @xmath8 lbgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , the spectroscopic properties of lbgs at @xmath8 are still unknown . only about a dozen spectra",
    "have been published so far @xcite , and extensive follow - up spectroscopies have been currently made . among these , most of the spectra show only ly@xmath1 emission , and virtually no information can be drawn from their continuum spectrum .",
    "@xcite successfully detected the continuum and line features of gravitationally lensed galaxies at @xmath9 and have found the presence of interstellar absorption lines .",
    "more recently , @xcite detected the continuum and interstellar absorption lines of an gravitationally lensed lbg at @xmath10 with a good signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio with an extremely long ( 22.3 hours ) exposure time .",
    "we are also conducting a spectroscopic study of lbgs at @xmath3 found by @xcite and iwata et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , and @xcite present the first results .",
    "the obtained spectra show no or weak ly@xmath1 emission in contrast to lbgs at @xmath11 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and rather strong low - ionization interstellar ( lis ) absorption lines of which equivalent widths ( ews ) are comparable to those seen in lbgs at @xmath11 @xcite",
    ". we also found the ly@xmath1 emissions are redshifted by about @xmath12 km s@xmath13 relative to the interstellar absorption lines in a part of them , which suggests the presence of an outflow in the lbgs at @xmath3 .    in this letter",
    ", we report a possible uv luminosity dependence of ly@xmath1 emission of lbgs at @xmath2 using our previous and new spectroscopic sample together with those from the literature , and we discuss some possible causes . throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt flat @xmath14 cosmology , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 km s@xmath13mpc@xmath13 .",
    "the magnitude system is based on ab magnitude @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic sample of lbgs at @xmath3 is taken mainly from @xcite and our recent results taken with focas @xcite attached to the subaru telescope @xcite .",
    "the former sample is obtained around the goods - n field and the latter one is obtained around the j0053 + 1234 field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the lbg selection of our sample is based on @xmath19 and @xmath20 colors , and details are described in @xcite and iwata et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . magnitudes of the spectroscopic sample in the @xmath21 band are @xmath22 , and the redshift coverage is @xmath23 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations and data reductions are achieved by almost the same way for both samples as described in @xcite .",
    "for the sample in the goods - n field , resulting spectra of 7 bright ( @xmath24 ) lbgs are shown in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "they show the continuum depression shortward of redshifted ly@xmath1 and some lis metal absorption lines , indicating secure identifications of the redshifts . for the sample in the j0053 + 1234 field ,",
    "2 bright ( @xmath24 ) lbgs were confirmed with the similar features to the goods - n sample , and 2 faint ones were identified with a strong ( ew@xmath25 ) ly@xmath1 emission line .",
    "the average ly@xmath1 ew@xmath0 of our 9 bright spectroscopic lbgs is @xmath26 , and that of 2 faint ones is @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to our sample , we take the spectral data of similar redshifts from the literature @xcite .",
    "the number in the sample is 6 , and the redshift coverage is @xmath28 . since the sample of @xcite is gravitationally lensed and their magnitude correction contains a relatively large uncertainty ( maximally 1.5 mag ) , it is excluded in the following discussion .",
    "we also compiled spectroscopic results of lbgs at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the number of galaxies in the sample is 9 , and the redshift coverage is @xmath29 .",
    "the object by @xcite is a gravitationally lensed galaxy .",
    "but its amplification effect ( @xmath30 mag at most ) is small , and thus we include it .",
    "note that the objects by @xcite are the @xmath31-dropout objects with narrow band ( nb921 ) depression ; a strong ly@xmath1 emission largely contributes to the @xmath32-band light .",
    "with the samples described in section 2 , we adopted ews of ly@xmath1 emission appeared in each paper . for the objects of our spectroscopic sample of lbgs at @xmath3 in the j0053 + 1234 field , we measured ews by the same way used in @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties of the ews are estimated to the 30 - 50% .",
    "for the sample of @xcite , we measured the ews from their figure 4 because the ews of individual objects were not presented .",
    "the uncertainties of ews are roughly 50% .",
    "for all these values of ews , the absorption for the emission line by intergalactic matter ( igm ) was not corrected , and the absorption component of ly@xmath1 was not included .",
    "figure 1 shows rest ews of ly@xmath1 emissions plotted against the rest - frame uv absolute magnitudes .",
    "filled circles show our spectroscopic results , and filled squares refer to the results from the literature .",
    "open squares represent those of lbgs at @xmath18 .",
    "we converted the observed broad band magnitude to the rest - frame 1400magnitude assuming a continuum slope @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) of @xmath35 which is a typical value for lbgs at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the uncertainty of the slope is small and estimated to be typically @xmath36 mag . for the objects whose adopted broad band contained the wavelength region shortward of ly@xmath1 , we corrected for the contributions by ly@xmath1 emission and igm absorption @xcite to derive the uv absolute magnitudes . from the uv absolute magnitude using the relation by @xcite",
    ", we also show the sfr estimated at the upper abscissa .    as seen in figure 1",
    ", there are no uv luminous ( @xmath37 mag ) lbgs at @xmath3 with strong ( ew@xmath3820 ) ly@xmath1 emission , while uv faint ones show wide range of ew@xmath0 and tend to have stronger ly@xmath1 emission than uv luminous lbgs on average .",
    "in addition , there seems to be a uv magnitude threshold for lbgs with strong ly@xmath1 emission around @xmath39 mag which is almost the same as the @xmath40 magnitude of the uvlf of our @xmath3 lbg sample @xcite and that of @xcite .",
    "this trend still holds if the data by @xcite are considered .",
    "a similar deficiency of the luminous lbgs with strong ly@xmath1 emission seems to hold at @xmath18 , although the sample size is quite small especially for a luminous part ( @xmath41 mag ) .",
    "there seems to be the threshold magnitude around @xmath42 mag which is close to the @xmath40 of the uvlf at @xmath18 of @xcite and @xmath43 mag brighter than that of @xcite .",
    "the threshold magnitude is @xmath44 mag brighter than that of lbgs at @xmath3 , which might suggest its evolution .",
    "but the current sample number is not large enough to be definitively to illustrate the evolution of the threshold magnitude .",
    "we note that the deficiency of the luminous lbgs with strong ly@xmath1 emission is not due to observational bias at least for our spectroscopic sample .",
    "first , the minimum detectable ew@xmath0 of the ly@xmath1 emission in our spectroscopic survey is @xmath4510  for luminous ( corresponding to @xmath24 ) lbgs at @xmath3 , and @xmath4530  for faint ones , respectively , in the wavelength regions where night sky emission lines are not strong .",
    "therefore , we should detect large ew ly@xmath1 emission lines among luminous lbgs , if there are such objects .",
    "second , the number of the _ observed _ luminous lbgs in our present spectroscopic sample ( 22 objects ) is larger than the number of the faint ones ( 12 objects ) .",
    "thus , if the fraction of objects with strong ly@xmath1 emission is the same for uv luminous and faint lbgs , we should detect at least several luminous lbgs with strong ly@xmath1 emission , unless we happened to choose lbg candidates with a small ew@xmath0 in luminous candidates selectively .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test would not be useful because faint lbgs with a small ew@xmath0 are expected to be missed in the present sample .",
    "for the @xmath46 selected lbgs at @xmath18 , there may be a selection bias which leads to the apparent deficiency of lbgs with strong ly@xmath1 emission because the strong ly@xmath1 emission contributes largely to the @xmath47-band flux and reduce the value of the @xmath46 color .",
    "expected @xmath46 colors of the lbgs with rest ew of 20(100)  are @xmath48 mag ( @xmath49 mag ) bluer than @xmath50 mag , the color criterion to pick up @xmath47-dropout objects , in the redshift range between @xmath51 to @xmath52 ( between @xmath51 to @xmath53 ) . among the samples we used here , @xcite and @xcite utilized the @xmath46 selection method , and",
    "the samples may suffer from the selection bias .",
    "however , this bias should work independently of the uv luminosity , thus it may not seriously affect the deficiency of luminous lbgs with strong ly@xmath1 . note that the sample of lbgs at @xmath3 does not suffer from this selection bias .",
    "since the ew@xmath0 increases with decreasing uv continuum luminosity for a constant ly@xmath1 luminosity , the deficiency may just reflect the distribution of a constant ly@xmath1 luminosity . in figure 1 , we show locations of constant ly@xmath1 luminosity corresponding to 5@xmath5410@xmath55 , 2@xmath5410@xmath55 , 10@xmath55 , 5@xmath5410@xmath56 , and 10@xmath56 erg s@xmath13 with dotted lines from top - left to bottom - right .",
    "all the luminous lbgs with small ews have ly@xmath1 luminosity smaller than or equal to @xmath57 erg s@xmath13 , while about a half of the faint lbgs show ly@xmath1 luminosity larger than @xmath57 erg s@xmath13 . although the contrast is not so strong as compared with that seen in the ews , again there are no uv luminous lbgs having a large ly@xmath1 luminosity . in any cases ,",
    "the present sample is a combination of our spectroscopic data and those from the literature , and the sample size is small .",
    "a more homogeneous and larger spectroscopic sample is needed to examine whether this trend is definitive or not , although such data sets are hard to obtain even with currently available 8 - 10 m telescopes .",
    "since ly@xmath1 emitters ( laes ) are expected to have large rest ews due to their selection method , laes may be located in the upper left part of the figure 1 .",
    "we plot laes at @xmath58 and @xmath59 detected from narrow - band imaging data in figure 1 ; crosses and pluses represent laes at @xmath58 @xcite and laes at @xmath59 @xcite , respectively .",
    "we adopted values of ews from spectroscopic results for a part of laes at @xmath59 ( triangles : * ? ? ?",
    "the values of ly@xmath1 rest ews are not corrected for igm absorption for the emission .",
    "most of the laes are uv faint objects and the rest ews distribution is similar to that of faint lbgs . for the uv luminous laes ,",
    "ly@xmath1 rest ews are relatively smaller than those of faint laes and faint lbgs , and again we can see the deficiency of the strong ly@xmath1 emission in uv luminous laes .",
    "a recent survey of laes at @xmath60 in the subaru deep field @xcite also shows the same tendency ( see their figure 16 ) .",
    "these results imply that a fraction of laes in lbgs changes with the uv luminosity at @xmath61 ; among uv luminous lbgs , there are only a few laes , while among faint lbgs there are many laes with large ew of ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "this fits the trend that the ratio of laes to lbgs at @xmath3 decreases with increasing uv luminosity @xcite , although our results show a rather abrupt decrease of laes among luminous lbgs .",
    "thus , the laes are presumably a subset of faint lbgs , and are not the luminous lbgs at the redshift .",
    "although we need further studies to confirm this deficiency of the luminous lbgs with a large ly@xmath1 ew@xmath0 , we try to find possible causes for the trend and its implications .",
    "one possible cause is the systematic difference of the dust extinction between luminous and faint lbgs .",
    "since there are significant correlations between gas metallicity , dust extinction , and strength of lis absorption lines in local star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the presence of strong lis absorption lines in the luminous lbgs of our spectroscopic sample support this possibility . if we assume the local relation between the ew of lis absorptions and metallicity by @xcite , an estimated gas metallicity for our spectroscopic sample of luminous lbgs at @xmath3 is 12@xmath62log(o / h)@xmath63 ( @xmath451/5 solar : using the solar value from * ? ? ?",
    "at this gas metallicity , the ly@xmath1/h@xmath33 ratio is reduced by a factor of about 30 from the case b assumption for local star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "if the luminous lbgs at @xmath3 are more chemically evolved than the faint lbgs , it is suggested that the luminous lbgs at @xmath3 started star formation relatively earlier than faint ones .",
    "the clustering analysis of lbgs at @xmath3 shows that luminous lbgs have a larger correlation length than faint ones , suggesting luminous lbgs reside in a more massive dark halo ( e.g. , @xcite ; iwata et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the suggestions seem to fit the biased star formation scenario in the early universe ; uv luminous lbgs at @xmath3 are in a more massive dark halo and have experienced star formation earlier than faint ones residing in a less massive dark halo .",
    "we do not find the significant relation between the @xmath20 color and the ew@xmath0 of ly@xmath1 emission for our spectroscopic sample .",
    "however , this is probably because the baseline separation between @xmath21 and @xmath32 is too small to derive reliable @xmath64 values under the current photometric uncertainty .",
    "in addition , the s / ns of our spectra are too low and the wavelength coverage is too small to reliably estimate the @xmath64 values from their continuum .",
    "the amount of hi gas in and surrounding the galaxy can affect the ly@xmath1 ews . if luminous lbgs have much more hi gas than faint ones , it is possible that ly@xmath1 emission is selectively extinguished in luminous lbgs , resulting in small ews .",
    "the presence of a large amount of hi gas in luminous lbgs seems to fit the biased galaxy formation scenario described above ; luminous lbgs reside in a more massive dark halo are expected to have more hi gas than faint ones in a less massive dark halo .",
    "the age of a galaxy can also affect the ew of ly@xmath1 .",
    "a large ly@xmath1 ew@xmath0 ( 100 - 200 ) is expected for very young ( @xmath65myr ) galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . thus the luminous lbgs may be rather older than faint ones .",
    "however , it is hard to claim so , if the dust exists in a galaxy .",
    "in fact , using the results of sed fitting of lbgs at @xmath11 , @xcite found that the composite spectrum of young ( age @xmath66myr ) lbgs shows a small ly@xmath1 ew , while that of old ( age @xmath67gyr ) lbgs shows a large one .",
    "another possibility is velocity structure of the hi gas in / around the galaxy . from ly@xmath1 imaging and spectroscopy of nearby star - forming galaxies , ews of ly@xmath1",
    "do not necessarily depend on the gas metallicity .",
    "for example , @xcite claims that the kinematical property of the gas is a dominant regulator of the ly@xmath1 escape probability ; galaxies with outflowing neutral gas tend to have large ly@xmath1 ews , while galaxies with static neutral gas tend to have small ly@xmath1 ews .",
    "@xcite also pointed out the importance of the kinematical feature for the lbgs at @xmath11 , but their sense of effect on ly@xmath1 ew is opposite to that of @xcite .",
    "they found that lbgs with smaller ly@xmath1 ews tend to have stronger lis absorptions and large velocity offsets of ly@xmath1 emission relative to lis absorption lines .",
    "these facts can be explained if the lbgs with smaller ews have outflowing neutral gas with a larger velocity dispersion , because the gas causes a broader ly@xmath1 absorption for ly@xmath1 emission that results in a smaller ew of ly@xmath1 , a more redshifted ( asymmetric ) ly@xmath1 peak that is seen as the larger velocity offset between ly@xmath1 and lis absorption , and stronger lis absorption lines @xcite .",
    "we found the asymmetry of the ly@xmath1 emission line and the velocity offset of ly@xmath1 emission relative to lis absorption lines in a part of our luminous spectroscopic sample , which implies the presence of the large - scale motion of the neutral gas of lbgs at @xmath3 as well as at @xmath11 . thus there is a possibility that the gas kinematics affects the ew and the shape of profile of ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "we are grateful to the focas team , especially youichi ohyama , and the staff of the subaru telescope for their support during our observation .",
    "we appreciate the anonymous referee for the comments which improved this paper .",
