    "many mathematical models have been proposed to describe the evolution of populations , focusing on varied aspects , for example , mutation accumulation @xcite , and adaptation @xcite . in the first case , how deleterious mutations are passed to offspring , and",
    "the consequences for individual growth , are of particular interest . in the second ,",
    "the principal interest is the influence of different environmental conditions on the population .",
    "one goal in this area is the development of a simple model capable of describing the response of a population to environmental mutability",
    ". of interest , for example , is the ability of a population to adapt to rapid changes in its environment .",
    "penna s bit - string model @xcite seems well suited to this purpose .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a model for evolution of an adapting population , to study the consequences of variation of conditions affecting survival , related to environmental flexibility , and the genetic variability of the population .",
    "our main interest is to describe the conditions determining the extinction or survival of the population .",
    "the population evolves in discrete time with non - overlapping generations .",
    "it consists of haploid organisms defined by their genotype ( a bit - string of @xmath3 positions , or genes ) .",
    "the individuals undergo asexual reproduction , subject to mutation , competition and selection .",
    "selection is represented though a survival probability that depends on the difference between a genome and a certain _ ideal _ genome .",
    "environmental changes can be represented via alteration of this ideal . in the present study , however , the ideal genome is fixed , allowing a systematic study of the effect of various other parameters upon survival .",
    "we develop a mean - field ( mft ) description , which describes the evolution of an infinite population exactly , since it has no spatial structure .",
    "we also perform monte carlo simulations for the model .",
    "the latter are useful for studying fluctuations due to finite population size , that are not captured in the mft .",
    "we determine the survival / extinction phase boundary , and compare the temporal evolution , and the genomic distribution of the population predicted by mft against simulation results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the model and in sec .",
    "iii develop the mft .",
    "iv describes the monte carlo simulation algorithm , while sec .",

    "we study a model for evolution of a population of haploid individuals defined by their genomes , and subject to competition , asexual reproduction with mutation , and selection . in this model ,",
    "successive generations do not overlap .",
    "each individual is represented by a bit - string of @xmath3 positions ( genes ) , denoted by the vector @xmath4 , where @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the fitness of an individual to the environment is measured in relation to a  model individual \" ( or  ideal genome \" ) , represented by the sequence @xmath5 , @xmath7 .",
    "each gene in state 1 represents a reduction in fitness , and carries the same weight , independent of its position @xmath8 .",
    "thus the hamming distance from the ideal genome , given by @xmath9 , characterizes an individual s fitness ( this manner of characterizing fitness has been used in several studies of age - structured populations @xcite . )",
    "the dependence of fitness on @xmath10 is through the _ survival probability _",
    "@xmath12 is the probability for an individual to survive up to the stage in which she must compete with the rest of the population ; individuals that survive the competition stage go on to reproduce offspring , as detailed below .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 , which plays a role analogous to temperature in equilibrium statistical mechanics , represents environmental flexibility , while @xmath14 , which is related to the genetic variability of the population , represents mutational tolerance .",
    "@xmath15 for @xmath16 , and decays monotonically with @xmath10 .",
    "we note that for fixed @xmath10 and @xmath14 , the survival probability is an increasing function of @xmath13 , and that for fixed @xmath10 and @xmath13 , @xmath17 is an increasing function of @xmath14 .",
    "the fermi - like function @xmath12 was used in a similar manner in the model of thoms _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "these authors define a death probability @xmath18^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath19 is an inverse temperature and @xmath20 represents the difference between the typical number of mutations in the population , and the number of mutations of the individual .    at reproduction ,",
    "each organism is replaced by two offspring .",
    "the latter are copies of their parent , with a certain number @xmath21 of mutations .",
    "each position has a probability of @xmath22 to mutate ( mutations @xmath23 and @xmath24 are considered equally likely ) , with mutations at different positions constituting independent events .",
    "the number of mutations @xmath21 therefore follows a binomial distribution .",
    "the mean number of mutations per reproduction event , @xmath25 , is set to unity in this study .",
    "competition amongst individuals is represented by the familiar verhulst factor , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the population at time @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the maximum capacity of the environment . the evolution of the population proceeds by discrete time steps : at each step , the verhulst factor is applied by selecting at random ( independently of @xmath10 ) , @xmath30 survivors ; the survivors go on to reproduce as described above .",
    "we have developed a mean - field description of the model defined above .",
    "for this model , which has no spatial structure , the deterministic mean - field description describes the infinite - size limit ( @xmath31 ) exactly .",
    "differences between theory and simulation are due to fluctuations that appear in finite sized systems , but that are absent in the infinite - size limit .    in the full stochastic description",
    "there are @xmath32 distinct genomes @xmath33 , and an integer - valued random variable @xmath34 for each .",
    "our first step in constructing a simplified description is to reduce the set of variables to @xmath35 : the number of individuals with hamming distance @xmath10 from the ideal , at time @xmath28 . since the model does not distinguish between individuals with the same hamming distance",
    ", the probability distribution at any time @xmath36 will be a function of @xmath10 only , if it is so at @xmath37 .",
    "we shall always suppose this to be the case .    in the mean - field theory ,",
    "the discrete - time evolution of the population may be written so : @xmath38 , \\label{mft1}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 represents the entire set of population variables at step @xmath28 .",
    "in other words , the population at step @xmath40 is approximated by its _ expected value _",
    ", given the distribution at step @xmath28 .",
    "( the latter , in turn , is given by the expected distribution , given that for time @xmath41 , and so on . )",
    "the integer - valued random variables of the exact description are therefore replaced by a set of real - valued , deterministic variables .",
    "each step of the evolution consists of two stages : ( 1 ) death of individuals due to competition for resources ( ` verhulst stage ' ) ; ( 2 ) reproduction / selection . in the verhulst stage ,",
    "the total population size @xmath42 is evaluated ; then each subpopulation is reduced by the same factor , @xmath43 , yielding the values : @xmath44 note that the verhulst stage involves an interaction between individuals ( @xmath45 is a nonlinear function of all of the @xmath46 ) , and that each individual interacts equally with all others in this process .    in the reproduction stage",
    "each individual is replaced by a pair of offspring that have , in general , hamming distances different from those of the parent .",
    "we assume independent , equally probable mutations at each site , so that the number of mutations @xmath21 in a given reproduction event is binomially distributed : @xmath47 ( since @xmath48 while the mean number of mutations @xmath25 is of order unity , we may approximate @xmath49 by a poisson distribution in simulations ; we retain the binomial distribution in the mft analysis . )",
    "each reproduction event may be represented schematically as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the hamming distance of the parent and @xmath52 and @xmath53 those of the offspring .",
    "since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are independent events ( even though they happen simultaneously ) , it suffices to consider one such , i.e. , @xmath56 ; let @xmath57 represent its probability .",
    "if the offspring differs from its parent at exactly @xmath21 positions , then , @xmath58 \\leq h \\leq \\min[h'+m , g].\\ ] ] let @xmath59 , with @xmath60 the number of mutations @xmath23 and @xmath61 the number of type @xmath24 .",
    "each event is characterized by @xmath51 , @xmath21 , and @xmath60 .",
    "( evidently , @xmath62 . )",
    "the probability of such an event is given by the hypergeometric distribution : @xmath63 now using @xmath64 , we have , @xmath65 next we observe that the expected number of _ surviving _ offspring with hamming distance @xmath10 produced by a parent with hamming distance @xmath51 is : @xmath66 .",
    "thus the expected number of individuals with hamming distance @xmath10 , at step @xmath40 is : @xmath67 = \\sum_{h'=0}^g \\tilde{w}(h|h ' ) n'(h ' ) \\ ; , \\label{eqtcm}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the distribution just after the verhulst step .",
    "the evolution of the population is found via numerical iteration of eqs .",

    "we study the evolution of the model population in monte carlo simulations .",
    "initially , @xmath69 individuals of @xmath70 bits are generated , each with a random gene sequence , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 or @xmath6 with equal likelihood .",
    "the procedure is as follows :    _ i ) _ the verhulst factor @xmath71 is evaluated .",
    "then for each individual , a random number @xmath72 is generated ; the individual survives ( dies ) if @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "_ ii ) _ each individual reproduces : 2 copies are created , with possible mutations .",
    "the number of mutations @xmath21 is given by a random integer , chosen from a poisson distribution with parameter 1 .",
    "the mutation loci are selected at random .",
    "_ iii ) _ for each daughter , the hamming distance @xmath10 from the ideal is evaluated , and a random number @xmath75 , uniform on [ 0,1 ] is generated .",
    "if @xmath76 , the individual survives ; otherwise , it dies .    during the simulations ,",
    "we record the population , average hamming distance , the average survival probability , @xmath77 and the _ survival rate _ , @xmath78 .",
    "( note that in general @xmath79 , while @xmath80 may , in principle , take any nonnegative value , and is unity in the stationary state . )",
    "depending on the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath29 , the population may survive until a certain maximum time ( @xmath81 steps in the simulations ) , attaining a quasi - stationary state , or may go extinct .",
    "we record the hamming distance distribution in the quasi - stationary state .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath14 and @xmath13 that characterize the survival probability function @xmath12 , eq .",
    "( [ survpr ] ) , the population either survives or goes extinct . in the mean - field theory",
    "this is a sharp transition . in simulations , due to finite population size ,",
    "fluctuations into the absorbing state ( population zero ) are to be expected . indeed , for any _",
    "finite _ system size the population must eventually go extinct , if the process is permitted to continue indefinitely .",
    "we adopt @xmath81 as a convenient maximum time , allowing us to discriminate between survival and extinction , and ( in the former case ) , study quasi - stationary properties , except very near the transition , where , as noted , the sharp distinction is blurred by fluctuations .",
    "1 shows the phase boundary between survival and extinction in the @xmath14 - @xmath13 plane , comparing the mean - field prediction against simulations using @xmath29 = @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as @xmath29 is increased , the survival / extinction line found in simulation approaches the mft prediction , as expected . for small values of @xmath13 , ( a  hard \" or inflexible environment ) ,",
    "survival of population requires high values of @xmath14 , the mutational tolerance .",
    "the mean - field survival / extinction line of the diagram is obtained by fixing the parameter @xmath13 and measuring the stationary population density @xmath84 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "near the transition , @xmath85 depends linearly on @xmath14 : @xmath86 , as is normally the case in mean - field descriptions of a continuous phase transition to an absorbing state @xcite . the line @xmath87 is readily obtained via linear regression to the @xmath88 data near the transition .",
    "note that @xmath89 for @xmath90 . for @xmath91 , on the other hand , @xmath92 .",
    "( increasing the mutation probability @xmath22 , the phase boundary is displaced upward and to the right , enlarging the extinction region . )",
    "2 is a three - dimensional plot of the population density as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath13 ; the extinction region is evident , as is the monotonic growth of @xmath85 with either parameter .",
    "3 presents a typical evolution of the population density @xmath93 . for @xmath14 and @xmath13 in the survival phase ,",
    "the population exhibits a rapid initial decay and then evolves to a quasi - stationary state .",
    "simulation and mft evolutions are in good agreement , despite fluctuations in the former .    the quasi - stationary distribution of hamming distances obtained in simulation is compared in fig .",
    "4 with the stationary distribution predicted by mean - field theory . in all cases , the distribution peaks near the mean value @xmath94 , and has a generally gaussian appearance . for fixed @xmath13 , we observe that @xmath94 increases monotonically with @xmath14 , attaining a _ plateau _",
    ", if @xmath13 is sufficiently large .",
    "the plateau value is @xmath95 , i.e. , half the genome size . for fixed @xmath14 , we observe that @xmath94 increases with @xmath13 , until attaining @xmath96 .",
    "the variance of the distribution behaves similarly .",
    "its saturation value is about 32 , giving a standard deviation @xmath97 .",
    "this is not surprising , given that @xmath14 and @xmath13 both represent tolerance of differences from the ideal genome .",
    "5 shows the stationary values of @xmath94 and @xmath98 as functions of @xmath14 , as predicted by mft ; simulations yield very similar behaviour . in simulations",
    ", extinction occurs at larger @xmath14 values than are predicted by mft , due to finite - size effects , as noted above ; the difference between simulation and theory diminishes with increasing system size .",
    "we propose a bit - string model of the evolution a simple haploid population . similarly to previous studies @xcite , the model includes the effect of enviromental flexibility and tolerance to genetic differences on the survival probability .",
    "unlike previous works , we employ a survival probability that is a monotonic increasing function of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath13 that represent tolerance of genetic difference between a given genome and the ideal .",
    "the model is studied via computer simulations and mean - field theory , which are in good agreement .",
    "the model , like many others in population dynamics or epidemic analysis , exhibits a continuous transition between an active phase ( survival ) and an absorbing one ( extinction ) .",
    "we map out the phase boundary in the @xmath14 - @xmath13 plane , and find clear evidence of mean - field - like critical behavior , as in other population models lacking spatial structure @xcite .",
    "the mean - field description is exact in the infinite - size limit , but provides no information regarding fluctuations . on the other hand , simulations for parameter values in the active phase yield information on the quasi - stationary state of a finite system ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "it is also of interest to obtain the _ lifetime _ of this quasi - stationary state , or , equivalently , the mean first - passage time to extinction .",
    "such information can in principle be obtained from simulations , or from a probabilistic analysis of finite populations , starting from the master equation @xcite .",
    "given the large number of random variables involved ( @xmath100 , if we assume that the probability depends only on hamming distance @xmath10 ) , the multivariate fokker - planck equation would seem the most convenient tool ; theoretical analysis of finite populations is left as subject for future work .",
    "the simulation results reported here should prove useful in testing such theories .",
    "another interesting direction for future study is the response of the population to changes in the environment .",
    "such changes can be represented by variations in the ideal genome ( as presented in @xcite ) and/or in the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath22 , and @xmath29 .",
    "a related question is that of transitions in the genome distribution when two or more ideals ( corresponding to distinct , well adapted types in the fitness landscape ) , exist",
