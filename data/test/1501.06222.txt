    "if two or more physically separated parties can not communicate quantum information , their possibilities of measuring quantum states are severely restricted . intuitively , product states seem to be able to be optimally distinguished using only local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , while entangled states seem to be indistinguishable . however , bennett _ et al . _ found that orthogonal pure product states exist that can not be perfectly distinguished by locc @xcite .",
    "later , walgate _",
    "_ proved that any two pure orthogonal states in finite - dimensional systems can be distinguished with certainty using local operations and one - way classical communication ( one - way locc ) no matter how entangled they are @xcite .",
    "these results encourage further investigations on the distinguishability of quantum states by locc , and several important results have been reported in the case of orthogonal states @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider only finite - dimensional systems .",
    "the problem of locc discrimination for non - orthogonal states is much more complicated .",
    "one of the main reasons is that perfect discrimination between them is impossible , even without locc restriction . instead , optimal discrimination can be sought .",
    "_ @xcite posed the question : `` can any non - orthogonal states on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hilbert space be optimally distinguished by locc ? '' to definitively answer this question , we must consider all optimality criteria .",
    "various optimality criteria have been suggested , such as the bayesian criterion , the neyman - pearson criterion , and the mutual information criterion , but the above question is not answered except for very special cases , such as an optimal error - free measurement for two non - orthogonal pure states @xcite .",
    "another reason is that optimal discrimination for non - orthogonal states often requires a non - projective measurement on the space spanned by the given states , while any orthogonal states can be perfectly distinguished by projective measurement .",
    "a positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) is the most general formulation of a measurement permitted by quantum mechanics and is commonly adopted in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "we denote a measurement on a 2d hilbert space as a 2d measurement .",
    "some important examples of 2d non - projective measurements are a measurement maximizing the success rate for more than two states on a 2d hilbert space and a measurement giving the result `` do nt know '' with non - zero probability , such as an inconclusive measurement @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a composite hilbert space and @xmath1 be a subspace of @xmath0 . for simplicity",
    ", we say that a measurement described by the povm @xmath2 on @xmath1 can be realized by locc ( or one - way locc ) if there exists an locc measurement ( or a one - way locc measurement ) described by the povm @xmath3 on @xmath0 such that @xmath4 for any index @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the orthogonal projection operator onto @xmath1 .",
    "if any measurement on @xmath1 can be realized by locc , then any quantum states on @xmath1 can be optimally distinguished using only locc .",
    "_ s question can be rephrased as `` can any measurement on a 2d hilbert space be realized by locc ? ''",
    "we emphasize that this question would be quite difficult to answer . instead of a 2d non - projective measurement , one might consider realizing a corresponding projective measurement , which is obtained by naimark s theorem @xcite , by locc . according to naimark s theorem ,",
    "any non - projective measurement can be realized by a projective measurement on an extended hilbert space .",
    "however , if a 2d non - projective measurement has more than two povm operators , then so does the corresponding projective measurement , and such a measurement often can not be realized by locc @xcite .",
    "thus , this approach can not directly answer the question .",
    "alternatively , one might try to decompose a given 2d non - projective measurement into several 2d projective measurements .",
    "it is known that there exist `` decomposable '' measurements , which statistically give the same results as randomly choosing among measurements each of which has fewer povm operators than the original one @xcite .",
    "if a 2d measurement can be decomposed into 2d projective measurements , then from @xcite , it can obviously be realized by locc .",
    "however , only a few 2d non - projective measurements are decomposable @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that any 2d measurement can be realized by one - way locc no matter how many povm operators it has .",
    "our result answers the above question : a global measurement is not needed for a 2d measurement in finite - dimensional systems , regardless of the optimality criterion used .",
    "it is worth noting that the problem of realizing a measurement by one - way locc is closely related to realizing a quantum receiver .",
    "realization of an optimal or suboptimal receiver for optical states using linear optical feedback ( or feedforward ) and photon counting has been widely studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "this type of receiver performs an individual measurement on each temporal or spatial slot .",
    "a measurement can be decomposed into such individual measurements if it can be realized by one - way locc ; thus , our result indicates that any 2d measurement can be decomposed into individual measurements , at least in finite - dimensional systems .",
    "it is often important to investigate whether a measurement can be realized by one - way locc to check whether it can be implemented using only feasible resources when the whole system is spatially or temporally separated .    in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we present some necessary preliminaries , where we show that any 2d measurement can be realized by one - way locc if any measurement with finite rank - one povm operators on any 2d bipartite hilbert space in which alice s subspace is two - dimensional can be realized by one - way locc . in section  [ sec : proj ] , we recall the idea of walgate _",

    "indeed , alice performs a measurement on her system according to the bipartite one - way locc protocol that we will propose in this paper and tells the result to bob and charlie .",
    "then , bob and charlie can again use the same protocol .",

    "first , we show that our main reulst can be reduced to a simpler one .",
    "for example , from @xcite , any quantum measurement with a continuous set of outcomes ( including the discrete outcomes ) on a finite - dimensional hilbert space is equivalent to a continuous random choice of measurements with finite outcomes .",

    "moreover , from @xcite , an extremal measurement on @xmath27 must be made of finite rank - one povm operators , apart from the trivial povm @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the identity operator on @xmath27 ) .",
