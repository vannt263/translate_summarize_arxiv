    "the origin of fermion masses and mixing apart from @xmath0 violation remains one of the least understood aspects of the standard model ( sm ) of fundamental particle interactions . in the sm ,",
    "fermion masses and mixing angles are free parameters and span a wide range of values and to accommodate such a diverse mass spectrum , the yukawa couplings must span over five orders of magnitude . in the sm ,",
    "neutrinos are massless but experiments performed during the last two decades have established that neutrinos have small but nonvanishing masses which leads to a further increase in the number of free parameters .",
    "thus , the main theoretical challenges are to reduce the number of free parameters in the yukawa sector and to obtain tiny neutrino masses but large mixing angles .",
    "the proposals aimed at reducing the number of free parameters and , thereby , restricting the form of the mass matrices include the presence of texture zeros @xcite , requirement of zero determinant @xcite and the zero trace condition @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of vanishing minors @xcite and the simultaneous existence of a texture zero and a vanishing minor have recently @xcite been investigated .",
    "+ attempts have been made to understand the observed pattern of quark / lepton masses and mixings by introducing flavor symmetries ( abelian as well as non - abelian ) which naturally leads to such texture structures . to be more specific ,",
    "texture zeros and flavor symmetries have yielded quantitative relationships between fermion mass ratios and flavor mixing angles . a unified description of flavor physics and @xmath0 violation in the quark",
    "/ lepton sectors can be achieved by constructing a low energy effective theory with the sm gauge symmetry and some discrete non - abelian family symmetry and , subsequently , embedding this theory into grand unified theory ( guts ) models like so(10 ) @xcite .",
    "the search for an adequate discrete symmetry has mainly focussed on the minimal subgroups of so(3 ) or su(3 ) with at least one singlet and one doublet irreducible representation to accommodate the fermions belonging to each generation .",
    "one such subgroup , for example , is the quaternion group @xmath1 @xcite which not only accommdates the three generations of fermions but also explains the rather large difference between the values of the 2 - 3 mixing in the quark and lepton sectors . quaternion symmetry like some other discrete symmetries leads to nontrivial relationships amongst the nonvanishing elements of the mass matrix . such textures with equalities between different elements alongwith some vanishing elements",
    "have been referred to as hybrid textures .",
    "detailed phenomenological analyses of hybrid textures with one texture zero and an equality in the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis have been reported @xcite earlier .",
    "however , the investigation of the neutrino mass matrix in the diagonal charged lepton basis can only be regarded as a precursor of a more general study where both the charged lepton and the neutrino mass matrices are non - diagonal . in the present work , we examine the implications of parallel hybrid texture structures of both the charged lepton and the neutrino mass matrices in a nondiagonal basis assuming the charged lepton mass matrices to be hermitian .",
    "however , it is pertinent to emphasize here that hermitian charged lepton mass matrices can not be obtained within the framework of the standard electroweak gauge group .",
    "furthermore , parallel hybrid texture structures for lepton mass matrices can only be ensured by imposing discrete non - abelian lepton flavor symmetries .",
    "there exist a rather large , sixty to be precise [ table 1 ] , number of possible hybrid textures with one texture zero and one equality between mass matrix elements .",
    "however , we find that these sixty hybrid texture structures can be grouped into twelve classes such that all the hybrid textures belonging to a particular class have the same physical implications .",
    "we examine the phenomenological implications of all the twelve classes of neutrino mass matrices with hybrid texture structure under the assumption of non - factorizable phases in the neutrino mass matrix . + the @xmath0 violation in neutrino oscillation experiments can be described through a rephasing invariant quantity , @xmath2 @xcite with @xmath3 . in the parameterization adopted here , @xmath2 is given by @xmath4 the effective majorana mass of the electron neutrino @xmath5 which determines the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay is given by @xmath6 this important parameter will help decide the nature of neutrinos .",
    "the analysis of @xmath5 will be significant as many neutrinoless double beta decay experiments will constrain this parameter .",
    "a stringent constraint @xmath7ev was obtained by the @xmath8 heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite .",
    "there are large number of projects such as supernemo@xcite , cuore@xcite , cuoricino@xcite and gerda@xcite which aim to achieve a sensitivity below 0.01ev to @xmath5 .",
    "forthcoming experiment supernemo , in particular , will explore @xmath5 @xmath9 0.05ev@xcite .",
    "the experimental constraints on the neutrino parameters at 1 , 2 and 3@xmath10 @xcite are given below : @xmath11 the upper bound on @xmath12 is given by the chooz experiment .",
    "assuming neutrinos to be of majorana nature , the most general weak basis transformation ( under which lepton mass matrices change but which leaves the gauge currents invariant ) is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are 3@xmath16 3 unitary matrices and @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the charged lepton and the neutrino mass matrices , respectively .      in this section",
    "we investigate the possibility of obtaining parallel hybrid texture structures starting from an arbitrary hermitian charged lepton and complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we follow the line of argument advanced by branco _",
    "@xcite for parallel four texture zero anstze . for illustration",
    "we choose a specific hybrid texture structure ( ia ) [ table 1 ] with a zero at ( 1,3 ) position and equality of ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) elements : @xmath19 where @xmath17 is hermitian and @xmath18 is complex symmetric .",
    "we can rephase @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that @xmath20 where @xmath21 diag(@xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath24 ) and we can choose @xmath25 such that @xmath17 becomes real .",
    "we can use the remaining freedom to remove one phase from @xmath18 .",
    "it is instructive to enumerate the number of free parameters in the above two parallel hybrid texture structures .",
    "the charged lepton mass matrix after rephasing is left with four real parameters .",
    "there are seven free parameters in the neutrino mass matrix ( four real parameters and three phases ) . in total",
    ", we have eleven free parameters in @xmath17 and @xmath18 whereas in the leptonic sector considering neutrinos to be majorana particles there are twelve physical parameters ( six lepton masses , three mixing angles and three phases ) for three generations of neutrinos .",
    "thus , starting from an arbitrary hermitian @xmath17 and complex symmetric @xmath26 , we can not obtain parallel hybrid texture structures through weak basis transformations as the number of free parameters for such texture structures is less than twelve .",
    "this implies that these parallel texture structures have physical implications .",
    "however , if the condition of hermiticity in @xmath17 is removed then these parallel texture structures can be obtained through weak basis transformations and will , thus , have no physical implications as the total number of free parameters now in @xmath17 and @xmath18 are greater than twelve . in our analysis , we consider @xmath17 to be hermitian .",
    "different parallel hybrid texture structures of the charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices can be related by a weak basis transformation .",
    "the implications of these hybrid textures which are related by such a transformation are exactly the same .",
    "this weak basis transformation can be performed by a permutation matrix p as @xmath27 which changes the position of the texture zero and an equality but preserves the parallel structure of charged lepton and neutrino mass matrices .",
    "the permutation matrix p belongs to the group of six permutation matrices .",
    "we find that all sixty hybrid textures [ table 1 ] fall into twelve distinct classes when operated by these permutation matrices .",
    "the different classes are shown in table 1 . however",
    ", this type of classification is not possible in the flavor basis @xcite , since , such a weak basis transformation will render @xmath17 non diagonal .",
    ".all possible parallel hybrid texture structures .",
    "the hybrid textures in a class have the same physical implications . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we presented a comprehensive phenomenological analysis for the parallel hybrid texture structures of the charged lepton and the neutrino mass matrices .",
    "these parallel hybrid texture structures can not be obtained from arbitrary hermitian charged lepton and complex symmetric neutrino mass matrices through weak basis transformations and thus have physical implications .",
    "all the possible sixty hybrid texture structures are grouped into twelve classes using the permutation matrices .",
    "all textures in a class have the same physical implications .",
    "six out of total twelve classes are found to be phenomenologically viable and have interesting implications while class vii is only marginally allowed .",
    "the remaining five classes of hybrid textures are phenomenologically disallowed . for each class",
    ", we obtained the allowed range for the only free parameter from the charged lepton sector .",
    "predictions for the 1 - 3 mixing angle , the dirac - type and majorana - type cp violating phases are obtained for some of the allowed hybrid texture structures .",
    "we , also , obtained bounds on the effective majorana mass for all the allowed hybrid texture structures .",
