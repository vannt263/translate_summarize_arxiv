    "the purpose of this work is to describe some aspects of the dynamics of homogeneous three - dimensional incompressible fluids .",
    "the evolution of such fluids is governed by the euler equations @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the velocity and the vorticity of the fluid .",
    "we shall focus on fluids in which remarkable structures , called vortex filaments , are present .",
    "a vortex filament is a very thin tube in which the vorticity is sharply concentrated",
    ". it can be asymptotically assimilated to a curve @xmath3 in @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the time and @xmath6 the arc - length parameter . according to a suitable formal derivation , which will be described in the next section , the asymptotic motion law of the curve is the binormal flow @xmath7 equation exhibits a rich variety of motions , which will be presented in section [ sec : one - filament ] below .",
    "particular attention will be payed to motions generating a singularity in finite time .    on the other hand ,",
    "special solutions of the binormal flow are given by the infinite straight filaments .",
    "up to a rotation , we can assume that there are parallel to the @xmath8axis so that they can be parametrized as @xmath9 for some fixed @xmath10 , where @xmath11 can be also seen as an arc - length parameter .",
    "of interest is the evolution of perturbations of such straight filaments , namely the nearly parallel vortex filaments , which are parametrized by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is small .",
    "it turns out that linearization about leads to the linear one - dimensional schrdinger equation for @xmath14 @xmath15 next , we wish to investigate the dynamics of several vortex filaments that are all nearly parallel to the same @xmath8axis .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath16 filaments , which are represented by the complex - valued functions @xmath17 , with @xmath5 and @xmath11 . in 1995 ,",
    "klein , majda and damodaran @xcite derived , in a suitable asymptotic regime , a system of coupled equations for the filament positions @xmath18 @xmath19 here @xmath20 corresponds to the circulation of the @xmath21th filament , and the parameter @xmath22 is related to the core structure of the filament . in particular , in the case where the vortex filaments are all exactly parallel , i.e. if @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath24 , the previous system reduces to a two - dimensional system of ordinary differential equations for the positions @xmath25 @xmath26 this system is called point vortex system or kirchhoff law , and it has been intensively studied in the literature .",
    "we observe that the system combines two different aspects of the dynamics . on the one hand",
    ", the linearized self - induced motion of each filament already expressed in the equation  is represented through the schrdinger operator . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction of the @xmath21th filament with the other filaments is represented by the potential field @xmath27 , which corresponds to the velocity generated by the other filaments . ] . for straight filaments",
    "there is no self - induced motion , which means that each filament moves only with the velocity induced by the other filaments according to  exactly as for planar vortices , see section [ sec : point ] hereafter . the fact that both effects are taken into account",
    "in is really due to the asymptotic conditions chosen for the derivation , which relate the wavelength of perturbations , the core sizes and the separation distances between the vortex tubes in a particular way .",
    "since the system is thought to be a simplified model for the dynamics of filaments , a first natural issue is the existence and uniqueness of solutions .",
    "the potential fields are not well - defined at points when two or more filaments collide in finite time .",
    "one possibility is to consider weak distributional solutions , allowing possibly for exceptional collisions , and for which the potential is well - defined almost - everywhere ( see section [ sec : filaments ] ) .",
    "but then uniqueness is not achieved in this class .",
    "therefore , we will focus on a class of stronger solutions , for which the filaments are well - separated up to the largest time of existence of the system .",
    "hence the largest time of existence corresponds to the first collision time in this framework .",
    "it should be mentioned that , even for the simpler situation of straight filaments ( the point vortex system ) , collisions in finite time are known to occur for some initial configurations ( see section [ sec : point ] ) .",
    "therefore we can not hope for global existence in general .",
    "we shall determine sufficient conditions on the initial collection of vortex filaments that lead to large time or global existence , and we shall also study the case of finite - time collapses .    the remainder of this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec : one - filament ] we present the formal derivation of the binormal flow for the motion of one single filament and we describe some of its remarkable properties .",
    "in particular we review the recent results on singularities for self - similar and almost self - similar solutions of , as well as for their perturbations .",
    "section [ sec : point ] contains a brief state - of - the - art concerning the point vortex system , as an introduction to the more complicated dynamics of almost parallel vortex filaments .",
    "then , section [ sec : filaments ] gives an overview of existence and uniqueness results concerning the system .",
    "in particular , we present some recent results from @xcite on symmetric configurations of vortex filaments .",
    "we conclude by providing several and simple examples of finite - time collapses of vortex filaments .",
    "the collapses are of different nature , and some of them are new .    *",
    "notations*. in the following we will systematically identify complex numbers and real vectors . in particular , introducing the matrix @xmath28 we shall identify the @xmath29-vector @xmath30 and the complex @xmath31 .    *",

    "both authors are grateful to vincent torri for his support in using scilab .",
    "in this section we briefly present classical facts about the local induction approximation and about the binormal flow , as well as recent results of singularity formation in finite time . for parts of this description",
    "the reader may also consult the book @xcite and the surveys @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall start with a short description of the way the binormal flow equation was find as a model for vortex filaments dynamics in a three - dimensional ideal incompressible fluid .",
    "a fluid with a vortex filament is a fluid where the vorticity @xmath32 is a singular measure supported along a curve @xmath33 , which is parametrized by arc - length parameter @xmath34 , and with density @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 denotes the constant circulation along the filament . as a consequence of kelvin",
    "s circulation law vortex filaments move with the flow , so in order to get the dynamics of the vortex curve @xmath33 we have to compute the velocity of the fluid near the curve .",
    "the three - dimensional biot - savart kernel is @xmath37 so the velocity of the fluid is @xmath38 we fix @xmath39 , we suppose without loss of generality that @xmath40 and we get focused on what is happening for the velocity of the fluid near @xmath41 . for this purpose ,",
    "two localizations are done , one is that @xmath3 will be approximated by a taylor development of order 2 near @xmath42 and the other is that the integral has to be considered only locally around @xmath42 , on a segment @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "we obtain that @xmath44 is approximated by @xmath45 when @xmath46 , the first term is diverging but in the same way the velocity does around one straight vortex filament .",
    "one straight vortex filament remains still in a fluid , so this first contribution should not influence the dynamics of one single vortex filament @xmath33 . finally , even after localization , the integral in the last term is still diverging as @xmath47 .",
    "a time rescaling allow to resorb this growth and then the binormal flow @xmath48 appears as an approximation for the dynamics of vortex filaments , called local induction approximation .",
    "it was discovered by da rios @xcite in 1906 and re - lightened by arms and hama @xcite in 1965 .",
    "however the rigorous derivation of from the euler equations , and in fact even the question of the stability of the vortex filaments , are open .",
    "being a crude model , the binormal flow has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the positive points are the fact that special solutions as straight lines , translating circles , helices are on the one hand solutions of the binormal flow and on the other hand these dynamics are observed in fluid dynamics .",
    "this way other special solutions of the binormal flow may give some intuition for particular type of vortex filaments in fluids . a successful example in this direction are the traveling type solutions of the binormal flow found in @xcite and displayed in an fluid experiment @xcite . also , the binormal flow is accessible for numerics .",
    "one of the main issues of the l.i.a .",
    "is that closed curves conserve their lengths under the binormal flow which is not the case for closed vortex filaments in fluids .",
    "the binormal curvature flow also appears in the context of superfluids that are governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath49 more precisely , is conjectured to govern the asymptotic dynamics of codimension-@xmath50 submanifolds around which the jacobians of the solutions to ( a rescaled version of ) concentrate .",
    "this was proved in any dimension @xmath51 in the special case of the @xmath52-dimensional sphere @xcite . in a parallel setting ,",
    "mean curvature flow governs the vortex dynamics for parabolic ginzburg - landau equation @xcite . the fact that vortex filaments exhibit a common asymptotic motion law in fluids and superfluids results from a fundamental analogy between and the euler equations in such regimes .",
    "more precisely , the madelung @xcite transform @xmath53 , as long as @xmath14 does not vanish , yields a compressible euler type system for the variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is called hydrodynamical form of and it reduces formally to the incompressible euler equations for @xmath56 in the above - mentioned singular limit of .",
    "further details may be found in the recent survey @xcite and in references quoted therein .",
    "the binormal flow is a rich geometric equation .",
    "it is a completely integrable system . in the following",
    "we shall denote curvature and torsion of a solution of by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "some remarkable conserved quantities of the binormal flow are the kinetic energy @xmath59 , helicity @xmath60 , linear momentum @xmath61 , angular momentum @xmath62 .",
    "it is a reversible in time equation , invariant with respect to translations and rotations .",
    "the tangent vector @xmath63 of a solution of the binormal flow satisfies the schrdinger map equation @xmath64 which plays an important role in ferromagnetism as a simplification of the landau - lifschitz equation .",
    "let us present now the link with the schrdinger equation .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the linear schrdinger equation can be obtained easily as a rough approximation of the binormal flow .",
    "this can be seen by plugging in the ansatz @xmath65 to leading order when @xmath66 , we obtain that @xmath67 is a solution of the linear schrdinger equation .",
    "it was in 1972 that hasimoto @xcite has discovered the link between the binormal flow and the cubic one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the so - called filament function constructed from curvature and torsion of a solution of , @xmath68 satisfies the 1-d cubic nls @xmath69 with @xmath70 in terms of curvature and torsion @xmath71 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath72 which might be seen as a compatibility condition .",
    "let us notice that the hasimoto transform can be seen as an inverse of madelung s transform - actually curvature and torsion satisfy an euler with quantum pressure type of system .",
    "one can remark that the non - vanishing of the curvature appears as a constraint .",
    "nevertheless , koiso gave in @xcite a way to avoid this issue by using , instead of frenet frames , parallel frames @xmath73 that satisfy @xmath74 then @xmath75 is a solution of 1-d cubic nls . for details of this kind of hasimoto",
    "transform we refer to appendix a of @xcite . as a conclusion , up to a change of phase",
    ", the filament function satisfies the 1-d cubic nls .    by using the hasimoto",
    "transform the first local well - posedness results were obtained for the binormal flow - curvature and torsion were considered in high order sobolev spaces , see @xcite .    a recent result of local well - posedness for the binormal flow , for less regular closed curves ,",
    "was obtained by jerrard and smets @xcite by considering a weak version of the binormal flow .",
    "their method acts at the level of the tangent of the curve and it does not use the hasimoto transform . also , they have derived this way new results for the schrdinger map equation .",
    "as far as we have seen , there exists a number of intimate relations between the evolution of filaments in fluids and dispersive equations .",
    "we end this subsection by discussing other similar connections . in order to improve the validity of the binormal flow as a model for vortex filaments dynamics , an extended version of",
    "was considered by fukumoto and miyazaki @xcite , which includes an axial flow along the filament , @xmath76 here @xmath77 denotes the magnitude of the axial flow .",
    "the hasimoto transform leads then to the so - called hirota equation @xmath78 which is in link both with nls and the modified kdv equation ( see @xcite for the initial derivation of this equation ) .",
    "it actually turned out that the modified kdv equation appears as a model for the evolution of the curvature of a vortex patch in a two - dimensional fluid @xcite , see also @xcite for more details and for self - similar solutions of this model .",
    "an interesting class of solutions that is not covered by the previous well - posedness results are the self - similar solutions of the binormal flow and their small and smooth perturbations . since solutions of are considered to be parametrized by arc - length , self - similar solutions",
    "are of type @xmath79 it is then easy to compute that they form a family of solutions @xmath80 indexed by a real parameter @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xcite ) .",
    "they have been studied in the last decades as a frictionless model for the evolution after a line - line reconnection in the absence of counterflow for superfluid 4he and in ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "they also appear , this time for finite length filaments with appropriate boundary conditions , in some models for the fiber architecture of aortic valve leaflets , see @xcite .",
    "their rigorous mathematical study was achieved by gutierrez , rivas and vega , who gave in @xcite a description of the profile and in particular established that @xmath83}(s),\\ ] ] with @xmath84 distinct , non - opposite and @xmath85 so self - similar solutions of the binormal flow are smooth infinite curves that generate a corner in finite time . in fluid mechanics , their dynamics",
    "is close to the one of the delta - wing vortex . in @xcite numerical simulations for self - similar solutions of the binormal flow",
    "were shown to be in correlation with the physical experiment .",
    "another family of generating a singularity in finite time at the level of the frenet frame are the almost self - similar solutions @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a real @xmath88 antisymmetric matrix , see @xcite .",
    "gutirrez and vega @xcite proved that @xmath89}(s).\\ ] ] the curves at times @xmath90 are spirals , some of them with a singularity point , see @xcite for some numerical simulations .",
    "both similar and almost self - similar solutions have self - similar curvature and torsion , so the filament function is also of type @xmath91 and has to solve @xmath92 therefore the data has to be homogeneous of degree @xmath93 .",
    "the case of dirac distribution leads to the self - similar solutions of , and the principal value distribution to the almost self - similar solutions respectively .",
    "the study of small and smooth perturbations of self - similar solutions was initiated by banica and vega @xcite from the point of view of the stability of the formation of the singularity .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is the hasimoto transform : the filament function of the self - similar solutions @xmath80 is @xmath94 solution of . by the pseudo - conformal transformation @xmath95 understanding the behavior at time @xmath96 for perturbations of @xmath97 , solutions of , is equivalent to understanding the large time behavior for the equation @xmath98 a scattering theory has been developed in @xcite for this problem , by strongly relying on fourier analysis .",
    "the informations on have been transported at the level of the binormal flow by treating differently the regions @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in order to discard the linear non - oscillating term ,",
    "the asymptotic profile for @xmath101 has to be modified into the long - range one @xmath102    in @xcite it has been shown that wave operators exist , with a strong @xmath103 decay , for asymptotic profiles @xmath104 . by adding the extra - conditions @xmath105 and @xmath106 the existence of solutions of that develop a corner - type singularity at @xmath90 has been derived .",
    "this insures that the formation of singularity in finite time appearing in the self - similar case is not an isolated phenomenon .",
    "a similar result for the almost self - similar solutions of has been proved in @xcite .",
    "asymptotic completeness with loss of regularity was then proved in @xcite , in spaces defined in terms of the behavior of the low fourier modes . at the level of the binormal flow",
    ", this information has been translated into the fact that all small and regular perturbations at time @xmath107 of a self - similar solution @xmath80 still yield , after evolving by the binormal flow , a singularity at time @xmath90 .",
    "finally , in @xcite we give a geometrical description of the curves at the singularity time by getting a control of the evolution of weighted norms for equation .",
    "we prove the stability of the selfsimilar dynamics of small pertubations of a given selfsimilar solution , and in particular the fact that the angle of @xmath80 is recovered at time @xmath90 .",
    "[ sec : point ]    this section is devoted to a short presentation of the point vortex system .",
    "the reader may find the subsequent results as well as many additional details in the surveys @xcite and in references quoted therein .",
    "the point vortex system arises as an asymptotic motion law for point singularities in two - dimensional incompressible fluids , which are governed by the incompressible euler equations , or superfluids , governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "in contrast with the three - dimensional case , the persistence of point vortices and the validity of the point vortex model have been established rigorously for well - prepared data , at least up to the first collision time between the vortices ( see @xcite for the euler equations and , e.g. , @xcite for the gross - pitaevskii equation ) .",
    "system possesses an hamiltonian structure , since it has the form @xmath108 with the hamiltonian @xmath109 defined by @xmath110 as a consequence , we have the conservation of @xmath109 @xmath111 moreover , the point @xmath112 and the angular momentum @xmath113 are preserved in time .",
    "if @xmath114 , we define the constant center of vorticity @xmath115 it follows that the quantity @xmath116 is constant as well .",
    "a direct consequence of the previous conservation laws is that , in case of circulations @xmath117 all having the same sign , no collision between the vortices can occur in finite time and the @xmath51-vortex system admits a unique and global solution .",
    "it is well - known that the point vortex system admits particular solutions that keep the geometric shape of the polygon formed by the vortex positions . to describe these solutions",
    "we shall adopt the following definitions from , e.g. , @xcite : we say that the configuration @xmath118 is    @xmath119 a fixed equilibrium if @xmath120 , @xmath121 ;    @xmath119 rigidly translating if , for all @xmath39 , there exists @xmath122 such that @xmath123 , @xmath121 ;    @xmath119 a relative equilibrium if there exists some @xmath124 and for all @xmath39 , there exists @xmath125 such that @xmath126 , @xmath121 ;    @xmath119 a self - similar ( or homographic ) motion if there exists some @xmath124 and for all @xmath39 , there exists @xmath127 , with @xmath128 , such that @xmath129 , @xmath121 .",
    "note that in the first three cases both the shape and the size of the polygon formed by the points are preserved , since the motion is a translation in the second case and a rotation with angular velocity @xmath130 in the second case . in the case of homographic motion the configuration at time @xmath39 is obtained from the initial one by a rotation and a dilation .",
    "more precisely , it must satisfy @xmath131 , where the reals @xmath132 and @xmath133 are determined in terms of @xmath134 . when @xmath135 , which actually corresponds to the case @xmath136 , the configuration shrinks and collapses into the center of vorticity @xmath137 at time @xmath132",
    ". otherwise we have @xmath138 , i.e. @xmath139 and the configuration expands in time .",
    "for @xmath140 the distance @xmath141 remains constant therefore the solution is global .",
    "the motion is a uniform rotation about the center of vorticity if @xmath142 , and a rigid uniform translation otherwise .",
    "for @xmath143 the motion is integrable and has been widely investigated , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "an important part of the analysis was initiated in 1877 by grbli @xcite in his phd thesis",
    ". in particular grbli noticed that the @xmath144-vortex system can be entirely formulated in terms of the three distances between the vortices .",
    "the motion can then be analyzed qualitatively through the use of trilinear coordinates and phase diagrams , see the work of aref @xcite .",
    "there exists a large variety of regimes : fixed equilibria ( if @xmath145 ) , rigidly translating equilateral triangles ( if @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) , uniformly rotating equilateral triangles ( if @xmath148 and @xmath147 ) , collinear rotating or fixed configurations . also , self - similar ( shrinking or expanding ) collapsing configurations exist @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the conditions @xmath149 and @xmath145 are both necessary and sufficient to obtain a self - similar expanding or shrinking motion , and this provides an effective and simple way to construct them explicitly . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear stability of such motions has been investigated in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we shall come back to these collapses in section [ subsec : filaments - collapse ] , where we will use them to construct collapsing filament solutions .",
    "for @xmath150 the @xmath51-vortex problem is not integrable in general , but it still exhibits some remarkable solutions .",
    "first well - known relative equilibria are given by the uniformly rotating configuration of @xmath51 identical vortices placed on the same line in a particular way , or , when @xmath51 is odd , by @xmath151 identical vortices and a central vortex of arbitrary circulation .",
    "other relative equilibria are obtained by setting one vortex with same circulation @xmath152 at each vertex of a regular @xmath51 - polygon .",
    "the motion is then a uniform rotation with constant angular velocity @xmath153 , where @xmath154 denotes the size of the polygon .",
    "the problem of stability of these @xmath51-polygons was raised by thomson ( lord kelvin ) in the nineteenth century and has attracted much attention since then .",
    "the full answer to thomson s question  that the regular @xmath51-polygon is stable if and only if @xmath155  was finally recently provided by kurakin and yudovitch @xcite .",
    "one can get other uniformly rotating relative equilibria by adding to a regular @xmath51-polygon configuration one point of arbitrary circulation @xmath156 at the center of the polygon , in which case the angular velocity is @xmath157 . in particular , choosing @xmath158 one obtains a fixed equilibrium solution .",
    "the stability of centered @xmath51-polygons has been proved to hold by cabral and schmidt @xcite for all @xmath51 provided the circulation @xmath156 lies in a suitable interval depending on @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , the range of stability includes negative values of @xmath156 for @xmath159 .    finally , we mention that other relative equilibria can be constructed in the form of concentric rings of polygons with identical vortices",
    ". the polygons may be not regular , and the rings may have different circulations ( heterogeneous rings ) .",
    "relative equilibria of identical two - vortex or three - vortex rings have been determined by aref , newton , stremler , tokieda and vainchtein @xcite , and oneil @xcite constructed relative equilibria of heterogeneous three - vortex rings .",
    "the existence of collapsing solutions for @xmath150 is a difficult issue . given a set of circulations such that @xmath160 for all @xmath161 , the set of initial configurations leading to a collapse in finite time has zero lebesgue measure in @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in general it is not known whether self - similar collapses exist .",
    "necessary conditions for such motions are @xmath149 and @xmath163 , but , in contrast with the case @xmath143 , there are not sufficient .",
    "nevertheless , some specific cases have been explored : four and five - vortex collapses were studied by novikov and sedov @xcite and collapses of two - vortex rings were constructed in @xcite .",
    "collapsing configurations for infinite point vortex lattices are constructed by oneil in @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite exhibits self - similar collapses of heterogeneous three - vortex rings .",
    "the objective of this paragraph is to review known existence results concerning the system , which have been established by klein , majda and damodaran @xcite and kenig , ponce and vega @xcite .",
    "we also mention the work by zhakarov @xcite .",
    "we recall the system supplemented by initial data @xmath164 : @xmath165        the hamiltonian @xmath167 the mean angular momentum @xmath168 and the mean center of vorticity @xmath169 they are the three - dimensional analogs of the notions of hamiltonian , angular momentum and center of vorticity for point vortices , which have been defined in section [ sec : point ] .",
    "there is also conservation of the quantity @xmath170 which can be interpreted as a mean momentum .",
    "nevertheless , the previous quantities may be not well - defined , not even formally .",
    "actually , for general configurations of exactly parallel vortex filaments there are infinite . in the next section",
    "we will bypass this difficulty by the use of renormalized quantities .",
    "first rigorous results on vortex filaments were obtained by klein , majda and damodaran @xcite for pairs of filaments @xmath173 it may be convenient to introduce the new variables @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , @xmath177 .",
    "then @xmath178    in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) only the case of identical vortex core parameters @xmath179 is considered . then for identical circulations",

    "[ sec : point ] , the exactly parallel solution is given by a uniformly translating vortex pair . for nearly parallel filaments one looks for solutions with the same symmetry features , i.e. @xmath187 for all @xmath188 .",
    "the equations then yield a coupled system of equations for the real variables @xmath189 and @xmath190 .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", one can also consider the case when @xmath191 .",
    "it follows that @xmath181 so the equations are decoupled @xmath192 for identical circulations one retrieves the previous co - rotating filament pair . in the case of opposite circulations",
    ", @xmath14 satisfies the linear schrdinger equation .",
    "the linear stability of system , with @xmath179 , around the exactly parallel solution to the point vortex system is analyzed in @xcite .",
    "linear instability occurs when @xmath193 , while linear stability holds for @xmath194 .",
    "moreover , numerical computations predict global existence in the first case , and self - similar collapse in finite time in the second case .",
    "so , in contrast with the @xmath50-dimensional setting ( pairs of vortex points ) , finite time collapses of two nearly parallel filaments might happen .",
    "following zhakarov @xcite , klein , majda and damodaran suggested that such collapses should be well described by a class of self - similar solutions to the system .",
    "also the equations could maybe provide a class of self - similar collapses . to our knowledge",
    ", such constructions have not been rigorously achieved yet .",
