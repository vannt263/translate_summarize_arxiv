    "remark : in the mathematical sense this is not the true parameterspace , because we would like to have all marked points different , but since we make either pointwise statements with respect to one marking or only measure theoretic statements with respect to the lebesgue measure on this space the difference to a well choosen parameter space plays no role .",
    "moreover all statements are true for any conformal class the tori might have .",
    "the existence of the limits is established by counting lattice points of certain lattices in the universal cover @xmath12 of @xmath13 . as a biproduct of this method",
    "we conclude that there is a subset @xmath14 ( which depends on what one counts : saddle connections or periodic families ) of measure one in the parameter space of all n markings ( contained in the set of all non rational n markings ) where the above limit takes a maximal value @xmath15 .",

    "of course from the point of pure existence of the growth rates this is more general and in fact covers the examples described in the paper . on the other hand",
    "the results in this paper are explicit and the extremality , or more restrictive the maximality of the almost everywhere constants are proved for the above cases . in this direction one of the main objects of",

    "the lemma is viewed as the generalisation of the following observation on the torus @xmath145 ( with the origin as a marked point ) : a point @xmath146 is rational if and only if it is in the intersection of saddle connections .",
    "if this is the case the saddle connections through @xmath146 give rise to a lattice ( by taking representatives in @xmath12 ) .",
    "the moral of the lemma is : when counting saddle connections for general markings , all markings which are lying on some saddle connection and dividing the length of it rationally will cause a lattice of intersection points .",
    "this is important as we will see later , this decreases the asymptotic constant of that marking . because of this observation we also have to take care about the definition of the set of markings in @xmath147 , where we assume the growth rates to be extremal .",

    "markings is a set of full lebesque measure on @xmath147 ( see theorem [ tlimes ] ) . for periodic orbits the set of markings in general position",

    "the sets are equal in the cases @xmath152 ( trivial ) and @xmath153 , for more marked points the inclusion is strict .",
    "it will turned out the markings in general position are exactely the sets of markings on which the growth rates are maximal .",
    "note that in the case of two marked points the set of markings in general position is the same as the set of non rational markings , always assuming one of the markings to be @xmath154 $ ] .",
    "it should be noted here , that the pure existence of the growth rate functions for any choice of marking could also be seen using the siegel veech formula together with ratners theorem for ergodic measures on homogeneous spaces ( see @xcite ) . the more elementary argumentation here and in the chapter on general markings shows , that even for complicated markings one has to count only simple lattice point distributions to obtain the quadratic growth constant .",
    "to compute quadratic growth rates we recall some preparatory lemmas .",
    "the first is quite well known and uses an argument going back to gauss .    [ gauss ]",
    ". then @xmath156    to begin we treat the case @xmath157 .",
    "by drawing horizontal and vertical lines through the lattice points , we got a decomposition of the plane in rectangles with sidelengthes @xmath158 .",
    "every lattice point of @xmath58 can be viewed as the upper right vertice of one rectangle .",
    "so the number of points of @xmath58 in the concentric circle @xmath83 of radius @xmath7 is determined by the number of rectangles in that circle up to a certain correction term coming from the fact that a rectangle might be only partly inside the ball .",
    "but after increasing the radius of the ball by the length of the diagonal of the rectangles @xmath159 the estimate @xmath160 holds . and by decreasing the radius with the same amount we have : @xmath161 putting together these two estimates leds to : @xmath162 in the general case we have the estimate : @xmath163 the statement follows easily .    before stating the next proposition",
    "let us make a general remark on our strategy of counting . if our interest is for example counting prime closed geodesics , we associate a certain point distribution in @xmath164 to all geodesics in question",
    ". this point distribution @xmath58 does not reflect a priory the prime geodesics , but it will be choosen in a way that its quadratic asymptotics as in the last lemma can be calculated easily .",
    "the points in @xmath58 which are associated to prime geodesics will be the visible points of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath165 .",
    "the price we have to pay is that we can not relate the distribution of visible points and all points of ( the completed and closed ) @xmath58 just by the factor @xmath166 .",
    "we have to choose our multiplicities with respect to @xmath58 :    [ vielf ] let @xmath167 be a @xmath165 complete and closed lattice .",
    "let @xmath168 be the set of numbers @xmath169 such that @xmath170 .",
    "then the relation @xmath171 holds between the numbers of points of @xmath58 and the number of visible points @xmath60 of @xmath58 . for the lattice @xmath172",
    "this implies : @xmath173    first let us check that there is no @xmath174 that is not an integer multiple of some @xmath175 .",
    "assume there is , then there exists a @xmath176 and a rational number @xmath177 with @xmath178 .",
    "so @xmath179 divides @xmath180 , a contradiction to the @xmath165 completeness of @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath58 is closed and every element in @xmath58 is some @xmath181-multiple of an element in @xmath60 , thus : @xmath182 the lattice @xmath172 is obviously @xmath165 complete , closed and @xmath183 , thus @xmath184    counting only a certain percentage @xmath146 of the length of each line in a point distribution @xmath58 is equivalent to counting the length of vectors in the point distribution + @xmath185 .",
    "thus there is a relation : @xmath186 remark : as is seen above the relating factor between cylinders of geodesics and prime geodesics will be @xmath187 instead of @xmath166 because we do nt distinguish between the two directions a prime geodesic might have . our decision to do that",
    "is based on the point of view : count only ( the length of ) the geometric object .",

    "from the two equalities it follows immediately : + if intersections of the above kind have a nonzero quadratic growth rate ( so the marking is rational in the sense of our definition ) than the associated growth rates are smaller than for a non rational marking .",
    "the continuity follows from the fact that by approximating a marking in general position all the denominators of all the length ratios are growing over all bounds .      because of the simplicity of our methods we are not able to conclude anything about ( families of ) branched coverings of tori , without using the existence of the growth rate limits by the method explained in @xcite . even the sets where the growth rate is the biggest",
    "is not seen as just the preimage of the non rational markings on the torus .",
    "for closed cylinders of geodesics at least it has to be contained in this set .",
    "this is because the geometry and combinatorics of the covering might cause new sets where the growth rates are different .",
    "geometrically the reason for this is that the length spectrum of the cylinders of periodic trajectories is connected in a way to the saddle connections bounding them , which depends on the covering and where the singular points are .",
    "if one makes the simplifying assumption that all inverse images of the marked points are itself marked ( such coverings are called ` balanced coverings ' by some people ) , then from theorem [ tlimes ] one can conclude :    let @xmath466}$ ] a covering branched only over @xmath467 with the induced translation structure @xmath468 .",

    "if some of the markings are artificial ( i.e. not singular points of the induced metric ) then the growth rates after  unmark \" any subset of these points will be smaller than the above one .",

    "the second part is clear , because by removing nonsingular markings , the directions in which there are saddle connections are not changed .",
    "but in any such direction the number of saddle connections could decrease and their length increase .",
    "remark : with the results of veech @xcite every translation surface can be approximated by torus coverings in spaces of abelian differentials @xmath477 .",
