    "the fruit fly is considered to be one of the smallest flying insects with a wingspan of about 6 mm .",
    "it flies at about 200 wingbeats per second , which yields a reynolds number of about 120 .",
    "however , there is a large variety of flying insects that are much smaller in size .",
    "one group includes parasatoid wasps .",
    "the jewel wasp is one example and has a wingspan of about 3 mm , flying at a reynolds number of about 60 .",
    "another group includes _ thysanoptera _ , commonly known as thrips .",
    "these insects are characterized by bristled wings and fly at reynolds numbers around 10 .    in typical insect flight , lift is produced when a leading edge vortex is formed and remains attached to the wing , and a trailing edge vortex is formed and separates from the wing during each stroke . for tiny insect flight , neither the leading nor trailing edge vortices separate from the wing during the duration of each stroke . as the reynolds number",
    "is lowered from 100 to 1 , the relative lift forces produced during flapping flight decrease while drag forces increase significantly .",
    "these transitions are associated with a change in the behavior of the vortex wakes behind the flapping wings  @xcite .",
    "thrips were collected during july and august locally on the university of north carolina campus .",
    "fruit flies were obtained from a local collection in the unc department of biology .",
    "jewel wasps were ordered from carolina biological .",
    "high speed videos of the insects were taken at 4000 hz . in each case ,",
    "one or two cameras were focused on a standard pipette tip from which the insects were filmed during takeoff .",
    "immersed boundary simulations  @xcite were performed for a two - dimensional wing with a fixed angle of attack of @xmath3 immersed in a channel .",
    "reynolds number was calculated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 was the maximum velocity in the channel , @xmath6 was the dynamic viscosity of the fluid , @xmath7 was the density of the fluid , and @xmath8 was the chord length of the wing .",
    "the initially velocity of the channel was set to zero and then linearly increased to a set velocity determined by the desired reynolds number .",
    "particle image velocimetry was used to quantify the flow fields around a dynamically scaled physical model of a wing that rotated about its base .",
    "the velocities of particles illuminated in the laser sheet were determined from sequential images analyzed using a cross - correlation algorithm ( lavision inc .",
    "software ) .",
    "image pairs were analyzed with shifting overlapping interrogation windows of decreasing size ( @xmath9 pixels then @xmath10 pixels ) .",
    "lift and drag forces were also measured using a dynamically scaled physical model that rotated about its base  @xcite ."
