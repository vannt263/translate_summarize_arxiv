    "relative dispersion of passive particles in turbulent flows is one of the fundamental problems in turbulence research .",
    "it characterizes the transport and mixing properties of turbulence and is important from both theoretical and practical points of view . reflecting universal behavior of turbulent fluctuations",
    ", relative dispersion also has some universal properties because of its locality - in - scale nature @xcite .",
    "in particular , the dispersion process exhibits anomalous dispersion in the inertial range .",
    "this is first observed by richardson ( 1926 ) @xcite , and since then , a number of theoretical , experimental , and numerical investigations have been devoted to understand and model relative dispersion process @xcite .",
    "however , comprehensive understanding has not been obtained yet .",
    "recently , a few works focusing on underlying mechanism of the anomalous dispersion were reported . in the inertial range ,",
    "the mean free path , @xmath2 , the mean length for persistent expansion of relative separation without changing its moving direction , is an order of relative separation itself , @xmath0 : @xmath3 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath4 is a non - dimensional constant called the persistent parameter . in two - dimensional inverse cascade turbulence ( 2d - ic )",
    ", @xmath4 is estimated as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this means separating motions are not purely diffusive but composed of an appreciable amount of persistent motions .",
    "in addition , it was also reported that there is a relation between stagnation - point structures and richardson s law @xcite , and that dispersion process is described by persistent streamline topology @xcite . from these results",
    ", it is expected that coherence of turbulent field , which must share its origin with fine coherent vortical structures such as worms in three - dimensional navier - stokes ( 3d - ns ) turbulence , has a significant role in turbulent relative dispersion .",
    "the correlations in turbulence are characterized in scale - space due to their self - similarity , and are not made disappear by coarse graining in real space . reflecting these correlations ,",
    "relative separation moves persistently to some extent , so that , unlike the brownian motion , relative separation process should not be described only by random collision motions even as an approximation@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the characteristic length can not be defined because the mean free path , @xmath2 , varies depending on the spatial scale . whereas there are several experiments and numerical simulations of which results are rather close to the prediction of richardson s diffusion equation @xcite that closely relates to random collision motions .",
    "thus , these results raise a question ; how are the effects of persistent motions wiped out ? in the previous paper @xcite , we have introduced a self - similar telegraph model of turbulent relative dispersion , and showed that the separation pdf can be close to the prediction of richardson s diffusion equation for slowly separating particle pairs even in the presence of persistent motions .    in the present paper",
    ", we check the consistency of the physical picture of the self - similar telegraph model by carrying out direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of 2d free convection ( 2d - fc ) turbulence instead of 3d - ns turbulence .",
    "this is because ( i ) dns of 3d - ns turbulence requires extremely large computer resources , so that it is difficult to track particles for a long time , which is necessary to investigate dynamical properties of relative dispersion process , and ( ii ) 2d - fc turbulence has both statistical and dynamical characteristics similar to those of 3d - ns turbulence ( see appendix a ) @xcite . among them , the existence of coherent structures , which are approximated by the burgers t - vortex layer , is notable .",
    "this is a crucial difference from coherent structures in 2d - ic turbulence that are nested cat s eye vortices @xcite .",
    "therefore , comparing the results of the 2d - fc case with those of the 2d - ic case , we can investigate the effects of coherent structure on turbulent relative dispersion .",
    "this comparison gives a physical meaning of the drift term of the self - similar telegraph model .",
    "the inertial range achieved by our dns is not so wide that the relative motions of particle - pairs in the dissipation , the inertial , and the energy containing scales are not sufficiently resolved by usual fixed time statistics . in order to investigate the scaling natures of relative dispersion in such a narrow and limited inertial range , we utilize exit - time statistics introduced into research of turbulent relative dispersion by boffetta and sokolov ( see appendix b ) @xcite . by detailed investigation of the pdf of exit - time ,",
    "we show that the pdf is divided into two region , the region - i and -ii , corresponding to persistent expansion and random transition between expansion and compression of relative separation , respectively .",
    "this result agrees with the picture of the self - similar telegraph model .",
    "in addition , we provide a method for estimation of the parameters of the self - similar telegraph model by using exit - time pdf .    in the following sections ,",
    "first we provide a brief review of the self - similar telegraph model in  2 .",
    "section 3 presents a summary of the numerical scheme and parameters of our dns of 2d - fc turbulence .",

    "concluding remarks are made in  5 . in addition , some properties of 2d - fc turbulence and exit - time statistics are presented in appendix a and b , respectively .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite , we have introduced a self - similar telegraph model for turbulent relative dispersion , which is a model describing the evolution of the pdf of relative separation of particle pairs in the inertial range .",
    "the relative separation of two particles , @xmath6 is defined as follows : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the lagrangian positions of the particles . the model is based on sokolov s model @xcite and consists of persistent expansion and compression of relative separation , @xmath0 , according to the relative velocity , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are a dimensional constant and a scaling exponent , respectively : @xmath13 for kolmogorov scaling and @xmath14 for bolgiano - obukhov scaling . the transition rate from expansion to compression and that from compression to expansion are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
