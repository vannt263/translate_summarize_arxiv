    "in condensed matter physics , chemistry , and material science state - dependent interactions arise in many different contexts .",
    "they are usually obtained from coarse - graining procedures in which a subset of the degrees of freedom is integrated out ( see refs . for an overview of methods and applications ) .",
    "indeed , any coarse graining of the original ( be it classical or quantum ) system induces many - body interactions among the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "the idea is then to replace these complex interactions with state - dependent potentials that are usually taken to be pairwise additive for computational efficiency ( if necessary , three - body forces can also be introduced , as in ref .  ) and that are therefore much more tractable from a theoretical and/or numerical point of view .",
    "different criteria have been used to select the optimal set of state - dependent pair potentials . in the structural route the model with state - dependent interactions",
    "is required to reproduce some distribution functions associated with the coarse - grained ( cg ) degrees of freedom .",
    "it is also possible to define the cg model by matching the forces @xcite acting on the cg sites computed in the original , underlying system , or by requiring the cg model to reproduce solvation free energies .",
    "also state - dependent potentials suitable to treat inhomogeneous systems have been proposed.@xcite we should further mention mixed coarse - graining strategies that try to match simultaneously the pair distribution function and some other thermodynamic property , for instance , by constraining the virial pressure to be equal to the pressure of the microscopic model .",
    "@xcite these mixed approaches , although in principle incorrect since the potential is uniquely defined by the pair distribution function @xmath0 and the density according to henderson s theorem,@xcite may still be of value in practical numerical calculations .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 is only known with statistical errors and is little sensitive to the tail of the potential : visibly different potentials may produce structures with essentially indistinguishable pair distribution functions .",
    "@xcite therefore , the large - distance behavior of the cg interactions is determined with a large uncertainty , which might leave some flexibility to implement an additional constraint .",
    "we will not discuss these approaches any further , focusing on the conceptual problems of the approach rather than on the difficulties of practical numerical implementations .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the structural approach , which dates back to the early days of liquid state theory , @xcite considering state - dependent pair interactions for a very general class of classical systems .",
    "the microscopic , underlying model to which the coarse - graining procedure is applied consists of polyatomic molecules .",
    "no hypothesis is made on the nature of the interactions among the atoms : we only require them to be state independent , but , otherwise , they are arbitrary and can , in principle , include any type of many - body terms .",
    "our discussion therefore applies both to monoatomic systems with three- and higher - body interactions ( for instance , to noble gases whose accurate study requires the introduction of the three - body axilrod - teller potential @xcite ) and to soft - matter systems , such as polymers , in which the complexity lies in the number of atoms involved rather than in the many - body nature of the atom - atom interactions . @xcite within the cg approach we replace the microscopic system at a given thermodynamic state with a cg system of monoatomic molecules that interact by means of state - dependent pair potentials .",
    "the latter are fixed by a structural requirement , the equality of a specific pair distribution function at a given thermodynamic state .",
    "if the underlying system is formed by monoatomic molecules , we consider the usual radial pair distribution function . in the case of polyatomic systems ,",
    "each molecule is replaced by a cg monoatomic molecule located at some point @xmath1 . in many instances",
    ", @xmath1 corresponds to the center of mass of the original molecule , but other choices are possible : for instance , in cg models for star polymers the point @xmath1 usually coincides with the center of the star .",
    "@xcite for our purposes , we do not need to specify how @xmath1 is chosen .",
    "we only require the coordinates @xmath2 of @xmath1 to be a weighted average of the positions of the atoms belonging to the molecule .",
    "once @xmath1 is chosen , we can consider the @xmath1-@xmath1 pair distribution function @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the density and @xmath5 the number of molecules .",
    "the state - dependent potential is fixed by the requirement that the pair distribution function @xmath6 in the cg model is equal to @xmath0 in the underlying system at the same density . from a practical point of view , the determination of the potential is not an easy task and several method have been devised , like the iterative boltzmann inversion method@xcite and the inverse monte carlo method.@xcite variational approaches have also been discussed , optimizing the coefficients of suitable parametrizations of the cg potentials .",
    "@xcite note that the structural approach we have described here is not the only one that is used in practical applications .",
    "we should also mention the force - matching approach ( often called multiscale coarse - graining method @xcite ) , in which the state - dependent potential is determined by requiring the cg system to match the atomistic force on the cg atoms as accurately as possible .",
    "also this method has a structural interpretation : the matching condition is equivalent@xcite to require the cg force to satisfy the appropriate yvon - born - green equation @xcite that relates the pair and the three - body correlation function .",
    "we mention that general theoretical formalisms within which different cg approaches can be derived are presented in refs .  .",
    "for a summary of methods and a detailed comparison in a specific example , see ref .  .",
    "once a cg model has been defined , one may use it to predict thermodynamic ( and , in the case of more complex cg systems , also structural ) properties for the underlying model .",
    "for instance , one would like to obtain estimates of the pressure of the microscopic system , by studying ( for example , by performing numerical simulations ) the simpler cg model .    structurally derived state - dependent potentials have been mostly discussed in the context of the canonical ensemble , see refs .   and references therein .",
    "in this case , the potentials become density and temperature dependent . for this reason ,",
    "some thermodynamic relations , which can be rigorously proved for systems with state - independent interactions , are no longer satisfied : in particular , the compressibility route and the virial route to the pressure are no longer equivalent for the cg system .",
    "this gave rise to several investigations concerning the thermodynamic consistency of models with state - dependent potentials .",
    "@xcite in this paper we again investigate the conceptual issues which arise when considering state - dependent interactions .",
    "the first question we wish to address is whether the knowledge of the cg model at density @xmath4 ( i.e. , of the model with potentials obtained by matching the pair distribution function at density @xmath4 ) allows one to obtain informations on the thermodynamical behavior of the underlying system at the _ same _ value of @xmath4 . considering , for instance , pressure and chemical potential , the idea is to compute these two quantities in the cg model .",
    "the results of this calculation are then taken as estimates of the pressure and chemical potential of the underlying system . the main problem in implementing this strategy stems from the fact that there is no unambiguous way to define thermodynamic quantities in the presence of state - dependent potentials : approaches that are equivalent for state - independent interactions give different espressions for pressure and chemical potential if potentials depend on the thermodynamic state .",
    "following ref .  , we shall consider two different approaches . in the passive approach ,",
    "the pressure is estimated by using the usual virial expansion , while in the active approach one derives the generalized expression of ascarelli and harrison.@xcite both approaches are not thermodynamically consistent and only provide an approximation of the pressure of the underlying model .",
    "a quantitative comparison shows that the passive approach provides the most accurate estimates , i.e. , it best reproduces the pressure of the underlying model .",
    "the same result holds for the chemical potential .",
    "widom s method applied to the cg system , even though it does not reproduce the underlying - model value , provides an estimate of the chemical potential that is closest to the underlying - model value than the estimate obtained in the active approach .",
    "note that , if we assume that the density - dependent ( dd ) potentials are known for _ all _ densities @xmath7 and no phase transitions occur in such density interval , then , via the compressibility route , we can compute the exact equation of state of the underlying model for any @xmath8 , hence derive the exact pressure , chemical potential , and free energy .",
    "however , in this case cg models with dd potentials play little role .",
    "indeed , their computation requires a study of the microscopic model in the whole density interval . but this study would also provide the equation of state directly , without the necessity of introducing any sort of cg model .",
    "it is interesting to extend the analysis of the thermodynamic properties of state - dependent potentials to other ensembles .",
    "for instance , for phase - coexistence studies it is more natural to consider the grand - canonical ensemble , while the isothermal - isobaric ensemble may be the best suited to interpret experimental data , since pressure is fixed in experiments . in these ensembles",
    "one would consider fugacity- and pressure- dependent pair potentials , respectively .",
    "again , the question we wish to address is how to obtain thermodynamic predictions in these different ensembles by using state - dependent interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we discuss density - dependent potentials and the consistency of several commonly used methods to determine pressure and chemical potential .",
    "we show that none of them is exact : none of the thermodynamic quantities extracted via a cg approach is more than an approximate estimate . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we study the accuracy of the different approximations : first , in sec .",
    "[ sec3.1 ] we present a general , model - independent discussion in the low - density limit , then , in sec",
    ".  [ sec3.2 ] we present a specific calculation for linear polymers under good - solvent conditions .",
    "the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] is extended to the grand - canonical ensemble in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , while in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we discuss the accuracy with which the thermodynamic behavior is reproduced by using fugacity - dependent potentials . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we start by considering the canonical ensemble and discuss density - dependent interactions . in principle",
    ", one should also consider a temperature dependence .",
    "however , temperature does not play a role in the discussion ( we do not discuss temperature derivatives of the free energy ) , so that it will be omitted for simplicity . in the structural approach to coarse graining , the basic quantity of interest is the @xmath1-@xmath1 pair distribution function @xmath9 defined in eq .",
    "( [ defg ] ) for the underlying model .",
    "knowledge of @xmath9 allows us to obtain the compressibility of the system by using the compressibility relation , @xcite which holds for any choice of the cg site @xmath1 : @xmath10 ,   \\label{compr_rel}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is related to the isothermal compressibility @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "no other thermodynamic quantity at density @xmath4 can be computed directly from @xmath9 or @xmath14 .",
    "however , they can be determined if @xmath14 is known along a thermodynamic path that starts at a state point at which the helmholtz free energy is known .",
    "for instance , in the absence of phase transitions in the density interval @xmath15 $ ] , other thermodynamic quantities like pressure , chemical potential , and helmholtz free energy at density @xmath4 can then be obtained from @xmath14 as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the partition function of a single , isolated molecule . for convenience , here and in the following we set the de broglie thermal length equal to one .    in the cg approach",
    "we discuss here , one maps each molecule onto a point particle . under the pair potential approximation ,",
    "the cg molecules interact by means of the dd potential @xmath19 , which is defined such as to reproduce the finite - density pair distribution function @xmath9 .",
    "once @xmath19 has been determined , one can use the cg model to compute thermodynamic quantities at the same density @xmath4 . in principle",
    "one could also use it to study the thermodynamic behavior at densities @xmath20 , i.e. , one could _ transfer _ the potentials from one density to the other .",
    "the accuracy of this procedure , i.e. , the transferability of the potentials , is an important question for cg studies , which , however , will not be considered here .    in order to compute thermodynamic quantities in the cg model",
    ", we will consider two different approaches , which , following ref .",
    ", will be referred to as the passive and the active approach . to define the two approaches , we consider the more general cg system at _ fixed _ interaction potential in the canonical ensemble , i.e. at fixed @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the helmholtz free energy is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the free energy ( [ fcg - def ] ) depends on two densities : @xmath24 is the usual quantity , while @xmath25 is the density parametrizing the pair potential .",
    "no relation between @xmath4 and @xmath25 is assumed at this stage .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ fcg - def ] ) we start by defining the pressure and the chemical potential for the general cg model at fixed @xmath25 : @xmath26 if we define @xmath27 we obtain the standard thermodynamic relations @xmath28 these expressions are the analog of those appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ pfa - kfa ] ) , ( [ mufa - kfa ] ) , and ( [ ffa - kfa ] ) , with @xmath29 , since the cg model we consider consists of monoatomic molecules . since @xmath25 is a fixed parameter , the pressure @xmath30 and the chemical potential @xmath31 can be determined by using standard methods . in particular , the usual relation between pressure and virial holds .",
    "hence we have @xcite @xmath32 as for the chemical potential , since @xmath25 is fixed , @xmath31 can be obtained by using widom s insertion method@xcite @xmath33 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the canonical ensemble average over @xmath5 molecules in a volume @xmath21 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the insertion energy of an additional molecule computed by using @xmath37 .",
    "the dd pair potential at density @xmath38 is determined by requiring the pair distribution function @xmath39 to be equal to the @xmath40 pair distribution function @xmath41 in the underlying microscopic model : @xmath42 . in the passive approach@xcite @xmath25",
    "is considered as a fixed parameter which is set equal to @xmath4 only at the end of the calculations .",
    "therefore , the pressure for the cg model at density @xmath4 is simply @xmath43 ; analogously the chemical potential is defined as @xmath44 . because of the compressibility relation ( [ compr_rel ] ) , the cg and the microscopic compressibilities are equal , i.e. @xmath45 this equality does not extend , however , to the other thermodynamic quantities : both @xmath44 and @xmath43 differ from the chemical potential and pressure at density @xmath4 of the microscopic model . indeed , barring unexpected concidences , it is expected in general @xmath46 where we used eq .",
    "( [ k - equality ] ) to replace @xmath14 with @xmath47 in the left - hand side integrals , which give chemical potential and pressure in the underlying model .",
    "hence , if we use the virial route for the pressure or widom s insertion method for the chemical potential in the cg model , we only obtain approximations to the underlying - model pressure and chemical potential : even with the use of dd potentials , we can not obtain the underlying - model thermodynamics at density @xmath4 from the study of the cg model at that density . moreover , the approach is not thermodynamically consistent .",
    "indeed , eq .  ( [ pcg - kcg ] ) implies immediately that the density derivative of @xmath43 differs from @xmath47 .",
    "of course , the pressure and chemical potential of the underlying system can be obtained by using @xmath48 and relations ( [ pfa - kfa ] ) and ( [ mufa - kfa]).@xcite but this approach essentially uses the equation of state of the microscopic model and does not make use of the cg model with dd potentials .",
    "it is also possible to derive expressions for the cg pressure and chemical potential by using the active approach of ref .  .",
    "the idea is to start from eq .",
    "( [ fcg - def ] ) , set @xmath49 , and then take the derivative with respect to @xmath21 .",

    "it is interesting to reinterpret these results as follows . for standard thermodynamic systems",
    "there are two equivalent approaches to the pressure .",
    "one can use the force route , in which one defines the pressure as the force per unit area exerted on the walls of the box containing the system . for a system of @xmath5 molecules in a volume @xmath21 interacting with a pair potential @xmath57",
    ", clausius theorem allows one to relate the pressure @xmath58 so defined to the virial : @xcite @xmath59 alternatively , one can define the pressure @xmath58 by using the work @xmath60 necessary to change the volume of the box by an infinitesimal amount @xmath61 , @xmath62 , which provides the usual expressions of @xmath58 as the derivative of the thermodynamic potentials with respect to the volume .",
    "the two definitions are obviously equivalent for density - independent potentials but differ in the presence of dd interactions . in the passive approach",
    "the pressure satisfies clausius theorem .",
    "this choice looks very natural , since the clausius equation ( [ clausius ] ) is a simple mechanical relation that is proved by balancing the forces for a system of a _ fixed _ number of particles in a box of _ fixed _ volume , hence at fixed density .",
    "the density dependence of the potential is irrelevant and therefore , one would naturally expect eq .",
    "( [ clausius ] ) to hold also in the presence of dd interactions . on the other hand , @xmath53 is defined by using the thermodynamic route , i.e. it satisfies the usual thermodynamic relation @xmath63 .",
    "however , it is not consistent with clausius theorem , hence the pressure computed in the active approach is not directly related to the force exterted by the particles .",
    "this is due to the fact that the work done when changing the volume of the system has two contributions .",
    "one of them corresponds to the work done against the forces acting on the box boundary ( this is the only contribution taken into account when considering the virial pressure ) , the other one takes into account the change of the potential as the volume @xmath21 is changed at fixed number of particles . from this viewpoint , the active approach certainly looks less natural than the passive one .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the dd quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( passive approach ) or their counterparts @xmath53 and @xmath64 only provide approximations to the correct result . in this section",
    "we wish to compare them with the exact result , determining quantitatively the size of the discrepancy . in the context of soft - matter systems , @xcite it is also common to use cg models based on zero - density potentials , i.e. potentials obtained by matching the pair distribution function in the limit @xmath65 . in this approach",
    "the potentials are fixed and then used to obtain predictions at densities @xmath66 .",
    "hence , in the notation of the previous section , the pressure and the chemical potential correspond to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . these quantities will be compared with the corresponding dd quantities , in order to understand which method provides the best approximation .",
    "we shall first consider the low - density limit , which can be analyzed in a model - independent way , and then we shall apply all formulae to a specific soft - matter example , polymers in the semidilute regime . in both cases , the results of the different approaches will be compared with those obtained in the microscopic model .",

    "we can perform the same comparison for the chemical potential .",
    "we find @xmath98 in this case , the chemical potentials derived by using the dd and the density - independent potentials have the same accuracy .",
    "expression ( [ muah ] ) is instead worse than both the one obtained by using dd potentials and the one obtained by using zero - density potentials .",
    "note that all deviations are proportional to @xmath99 , which encodes the contributions of the ( effective ) three - body interactions at this order in @xmath4 .",
    "hence , consistency is only possible if the three - body terms do not contribute to the thermodynamics , hence @xmath100 , a result which is not generally true since the free energy of the cg model in a generic cg procedure is never pairwise additive .

    "the state - dependent potential provides now a result which is slightly more accurate .    from these results ,",
    "it is clear that state - dependent potentials provide only approximations to pressure and density that worsen as the fugacity increases .",

    "good agreement is observed for the lowest value of the fugacity , while small discrepancies occur for the second one .",
    "if we use the decamer model@xcite we would obtain for @xmath115 the estimates @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which are now fully consistent with the full monomer results .",
    "in this paper we have considered structurally derived state - dependent potentials for cg models , with the purpose of understanding how useful they are in predicting the thermodynamics of complex systems . as already discussed in ref .",
    ", the virial or the ascarelli - harrison @xcite pressure computed in the cg model do not reproduce the pressure of the underlying system .",
    "but the same conclusions apply to essentially all thermodynamic quantities . in the canonical ensemble widom",
    "s method does not give the correct underlying - model chemical potential , while in the grand canonical ensemble the virial pressure or @xmath120 do not reproduce pressure and density of the underlying system .",
    "it is clear from the discussion that these results are not specific to these quantities . if the pair distribution function is used to define the state - dependent potentials , only the quantities that are directly related to the pair distribution function , like @xmath14 or @xmath121 , are identical in the cg and in the underlying model .",
    "all others differ . from a practical point of view , since state - dependent interactions are commonly used in large - scale simulations , it is important to quantify the differences between the cg estimates of the thermodynamic quantities and the underlying model values . in all cases",
    "we find that the passive approach provides the most accurate results .",
    "this is quite pleasant since the active - approach definitions look quite unnatural : the pressure defined in the canonical ensemble does not satisfy clausius virial theorem  hence the pressure is not directly related to the average force on the boundaries  while the density in the grand canonical ensemble defined by differentiating the grand potential differs from @xmath120",
    ".    ref .   noted that the pressure of the underlying model can be obtained by using the _",
    "compressibility route_. however , it should be clear that one is referring to the compressibility route in the underlying model , i.e. , to eq .",
    "( [ pfa - kfa ] ) .",
    "but this means that one is obtaining the pressure from a quantity computed in the underlying microscopic model , hence the dd potential plays no role .",
    "analogously , in the grand - canonical ensemble , the correct density can be obtained by integrating @xmath121 , but again this calculation does not really make use of the model with fd potentials .",
    "it is important to stress that structurally derived state - dependent potentials depend on the ensemble one uses , or rather on the thermodynamic variable one uses to identify the thermodynamic state of the system . at a given thermodynamic state of the microscopic system , dd potentials and fd potentials differ , since they correspond to cg monoatomic systems that have the same pair distribution function but different densities and chemical potentials .",
    "therefore , dd canonical potentials should not be used to predict phase lines , since the coexistence analysis is typically performed in other ensembles .",
    "although in this paper we have only discussed dd and fd potentials , the results are general and apply to other ensembles , for instance to pressure dependent potentials in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble .",
    "however , the conclusions do not necessarily apply to potentials that are only temperature dependent .",
    "if the thermodynamic state one is considering can be connected by a thermodynamic path at fixed temperature to the zero - density state ( this is always true in the absence of phase transitions or at least in the low - density phase ) , since temperature does not appear explicitly in the integrations leading to the free energies , the free energy is essentially correct ( one should only add the zero - density contribution of a single , isolated molecule ) .",
    "hence , all thermodynamic quantities that can be obtained from the free energies are correct .",
    "an interesting method for transferring cg potentials between temperatures in the context of the multiscale coarse - graining force - matching method is described in ref .  .",
    "it is important to note that the ensemble dependence does not occur in cg models defined by using the multiscale coarse - graining approach based on the force - matching method.@xcite indeed , the distribution of the atomistic configurations is obviously ensemble independent in the infinite - volume limit , hence also the matching conditions and the cg model do not depend on the ensemble ( see ref .   for a discussion in the isobaric - isothermal ensemble ) .",
    "our results also shed some light on mixed approaches in which one matches the pair distribution and some other thermodynamic property .",
    "these approaches are conceptually correct only if the thermodynamic quantity is appropriately chosen . in the canonical ensemble ,",
    "the only correct choice is the isothermal compressibility , i.e. the quantity @xmath122 we have introduced , while in the grand canonical ensemble one should use @xmath121 .",
    "it is also possible to enforce the value of the pressure , i.e. to work in the isothermal - isobaric ensemble , but in this case one should relax the condition that the microscopic system and the cg model have the same density . for each choice ,",
    "a different state - dependent potential is obtained , as observed , for instance , in ref .   in the context of cg models of water .",
    "note that these observations can be trivially generalized to multicomponent systems . in this case",

    "for a recent example .    the fact that dd potentials are unable to provide the correct results for the thermodynamic quantities should not be surprising .",
    "after all , even with the use of a state - dependent potential , the cg model is still an approximation to the original microscopic model .",
    "hence , one should consider this approach as a simple method to obtain relatively good approximations for the behavior of complex systems .",
    "it is easy to find situations , both in theoretical or experimental work , in which state - dependent potentials are useful . for instance , one could consider a system of complex molecules for which simulations are particularly difficult . in order to obtain with reasonable precision the value of the thermodynamic quantities in a range of densities , one could perform a simulation at a density @xmath25 , measuring all thermodynamic quantities and the density - dependent potential @xmath37 . then , to compute the pressure for @xmath123 , one could write @xmath124,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and determine the second term by using the cg model that uses the dd potential computed at density @xmath25 . hence , one could estimate @xmath125 , \\label{approx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the cg model to compute the differences between the state point of interest and that for which exact results , i.e. results obtained in the microscopic model , are available .",
    "cg models with zero - density potentials use exactly this strategy , fixing @xmath126 .",
    "the same strategy could also be used in experiments , allowing one to obtain all thermodynamic informations in a range of densities , using experimentally determined thermodynamic and structural data at @xmath25 .",
    "we have checked this strategy in our polymer example .",
    "assuming that the exact results for @xmath58 and @xmath127 are available at @xmath128 , we wish to compute @xmath58 and @xmath127 at @xmath129 . using the dd potential computed at @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath130 and @xmath131 at @xmath128 ( see table  [ tabledd ] ) and @xmath132 and @xmath133 at @xmath129 .",
    "hence , we would estimate at @xmath129 @xmath134 to be compared with the fm predictions @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "estimates ( [ est - phen ] ) are significantly more precise than those reported in table  [ tabledd ] , confirming the usefulness of the approach .",
    "finally , note that we have considered here very simple cg models in which the cg molecules are monoatomic .",
    "in practical soft - matter applications cg models are usually polyatomic .",
    "it is quite obvious that the same conclusions apply to these more complex models : also in this case structurally derived potentials depend on the ensemble and thermodynamics is only approximately reproduced .",
