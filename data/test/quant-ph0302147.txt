    "a pure squeezed state is not produced .",
    "rather , there is a quantum diffusion process present during the generation of the squeezed light .",
    "this is intrinsic quantum noise which is present for the duration of the interaction time .",
    "the hamiltonian , in the interaction picture , describing the process of parametric amplification in the presence of noise is @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes the nonlinearity of the crystal .",

    "this corresponds to a squeezed state which is generated in the absence of noise .",
    "the presence of the internal quantum noise always produces a mixed state .",
    "the resulting mixed states may be separable or nonseparable , depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "a separability criterion for two - mode gaussian states has been established which relies on the partial transposition map acting on the two - party state @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this criterion is equivalent to determining that the quantum state is p - representable .",
    "a two - mode gaussian state is p - representable , and hence , separable , if and only if @xmath67 where * v * is the covariance matrix for the characteristic function found in eq.([eq : charfunc ] ) which takes the special form of eq.([eq : vmatrix ] ) .",
    "the separability condition is also equivalent to the condition that the matrix elements of ( [ eq : vmatrix ] ) satisfy @xmath68 .",

    "it is negative , while in other regions it is positive .",
    "the negativity of @xmath71 may be summarized as sign@xmath72=sign@xmath73 .",
    "hence , the state is nonseparable if and only if @xmath74 this is the requirement that the squeezing parameter be greater than the product of the single - photon loss rate described by the internal diffusion parameter and the mean photon number of the reservoir .",

    "the dots show states which have @xmath75 for different values of the diffusion parameter @xmath76 .",
    "we immediately see that if @xmath75 then @xmath77 for all parameter space so that the system is never separable .",
    "therefore , one may conclude that this system is entangled for all of parameter space when coupled to a zero - temperature heat bath .",
    "this is interesting because the diffusion parameter may be made as large as desired and still the state is nonseparable , even as the diffusion approaches infinity .",
    "the nonseparable states may be further classified into two sets : those which exhibit quantum nonlocality and those which do not .",
    "if the two - mode squeezed state is generated with internal noise present then the resulting state will be a mixed state .",
    "although all pure entangled states violate some bell inequality , it is not clear in general which mixed entangled states will do so .",
    "if no noise is present then there always exists , for a fixed @xmath3 , some range of values for @xmath78 which will correspond to a nonlocal state .",
    "the presence of the diffusion parameter will destroy the nonlocal features until some critical value for d is reached such that the state goes from nonlocal to classically correlated .",
    "thus , in addition to the pure states ( @xmath79 ) which are nonlocal , there is a set of mixed states ( @xmath80 ) which is also nonlocal .    to study the nonlocal properties of the state ( [ eq : wigner ] ) we use the formalism of parity operator correlations developed in @xcite .",
    "the wigner function is related to the expectation value of a displaced parity operator in phase space given by @xmath81 .",
    "this expectation value defines a correlation function @xmath82 for parity measurements of mode 1 and mode 2 , which is proportional to the two - mode wigner function . in analogy with the case of dichotomic spin states ,",
    "a bell combination may be written , using correlations between parity measurements , as @xmath83    for a two - mode squeezed state with internal noise the combination @xmath84 will be a function of the interaction time as well as the squeezing and noise parameters .",
    "the bell combination is @xmath85    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath86 and @xmath87 are given by eqs.([eq : cparameter],[eq : hparameter ] ) which are implicitly functions of time , and @xmath88 is the square of the coherent amplitude of the light mode .",
    "a search algorithm finds a local maximum for @xmath84 and returns the values of the free parameters .",
    "the function @xmath84 has a maximum of 2.19 with values @xmath89 , and @xmath75 .",
    "as expected , the bell combination is most nonlocal when there is no noise present and the squeezed state is a pure two - mode squeezed state . in this case , one finds a stronger violation for large r and small intensity @xmath78 . to see how the internal noise affects the nonlocality of the state we set @xmath90 and let @xmath78 and @xmath76 vary in fig.2 .",
    ", for the two field modes and the diffusion parameter , @xmath76 , with the squeezing parameter fixed at @xmath90 and @xmath75 . ]",
    "it is clear that the diffusion parameter destroys the nonlocal features of the state .",
    "3 shows a cross - section of the three dimensional graph of fig . 2 for @xmath91 . the bell combination is greater than 2 for small values of the diffusion parameter , @xmath76 . on a large scale",
    ", we find that as d increases the bell combination decreases , reaches a minimum , and then increases to approach 2 from below .",
    "using the two - mode squeezed state of eq.([eq : w2mss ] ) , a class of nonseparable , non - gaussian , mixed states can be explored .",
    "we will consider two cases : a convex combination of a pure entangled state with an uncorrelated mixed state , and a convex combination of a pure entangled state with a classically correlated state .",
    "the first case is the analogue of the werner state for continuous variables .",
    "werner @xcite investigated the state @xmath92 for @xmath93 which is a convex combination of a maximally entangled state @xmath94 for finite dimension @xmath95 with a maximally mixed state obtained by a partial trace over the maximally entangled state .",
    "it was shown that such a state is nonseparable if and only if @xmath96      a natural extension of a werner state for infinite dimensions is a convex combination of a maximally entangled state with the maximally mixed state @xmath97 for two modes of light , a and b. this state is analogous to the werner state when the squeezing parameter r is infinite .",
    "the continuous variable phase - space representation of this state is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the marginal wigner function obtained by the integration @xmath100 over the variables of one mode .",
    "when r is infinite , the wigner function @xmath101 is the epr state and the function @xmath99 has infinite variance representing a maximally mixed state of knowledge .",
    "note that eq.([eq : cvwigner ] ) is not a gaussian operator , but rather , it is a linear superposition of gaussian operators .",
    "the separability conditions for a linear superposition of two gaussian operators have not yet been established . however , it has been shown that the state @xmath102 is nonseparable if @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "this is the limit of the finite dimensional case , eq.([eq : wernercondition ] ) , as the dimension of the hilbert space , d , approaches infinity .",
    "a test of nonlocality for the state @xmath104 in phase space can be performed using the same bell combination given by eq.([eq : bellcombo ] ) .",
    "it is found that the state remains nonlocal for a region of mixtures lying between @xmath105 and @xmath106 . adding a mixed state to the entangled state",
    "rapidly degrades the nonlocal features .",
    "in addition to the werner state of eq.([eq : cvwernerstate ] ) for continuous variables , a different convex combination has some interesting properties .",
    "let us consider the state @xmath107 which is a convex combination of a two - mode squeezed state with a phase - averaged state . rather than integrating over one mode of light , an integration over the phases of both modes is performed .",
    "the state @xmath108 describes phase diffusion of two light modes such that each mode has a completely random phase .",
    "the integral of eq.([eq : phaseaveragedstate ] ) leads to a phase - averaged wigner function given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "in contrast to the werner state , this state does not factorize into a product of functions containing each mode .",
    "the state @xmath111 is a classically correlated state .",
    "the state of eq.([eq : wernertypestate ] ) now being considered is a mixture of a state containing quantum correlations and a state containing classical correlations .",
    "the nonlocality of this state is examined by considering an expansion for small intensity , @xmath78 , of the bell combination given by eq.([eq : bellcombo ] ) .",
    "this expansion @xmath112 reveals that the state ( [ eq : wernertypestate ] ) is nonlocal for all @xmath103 .",
    "this is seen in fig.(5 ) which shows that only the case @xmath113 washes out the nonlocal features completely .",
    "thus , we have presented a classically correlated state which , when mixed with even the smallest amount of a quantum correlated state , shows nonlocal features .",

    "the fokker - planck equation was solved to obtain an exact solution for the wigner function .",
    "the steady - state and nonsteady - state regimes were explored .",
    "we found that nonlocal features of this state exist in the regime where no steady - state solution exists .",
    "the parameter space contains separable and nonseparable states , both mixed and pure . only one pure state exists which is nonseparable .",
    "nearly all states in the parameter space are mixed states . using the gaussian wigner function for the state , the separability criterion was determined to identify those mixed states which are nonseparable .",
    "there exists a set of nonseparable mixed states for which the quantum diffusion can be large @xmath114 .",
    "using the wigner function , a test of nonlocality in phase space determined the effect of internal quantum noise on bell s inequality .",
    "as expected , the noise parameters reduce the nonlocality of the state .",
    "but there is still a region of mixed entangled states which are nonlocal .",
    "to further study nonseparable mixed states exhibiting nonlocality , we investigated werner - type states for continuous variables .",
    "we found that mixing the two - mode squeezed state with a product of two thermal states destroys the nonlocal features state .",
    "additionally , we found that mixing the pure two - mode squeezed state with a phase - diffused , classically correlated state did not destroy the nonlocal features , regardless of the amount of mixing . with this , we have provided an example of a classically correlated state which , when mixed with even the smallest amount of pure entangled state , is nonlocal ."
