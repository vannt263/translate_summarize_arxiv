    "the importance of studying the isolated galaxies is quite evident now .",
    "a well - defined , numerous , complete and homogeneous sample of isolated galaxies , which are situated in low - density regions is necessary as reference one to study properties of galaxies in groups and clusters .",
    "a special aspect is the investigation of physical processes in isolated galaxies to explain their star formation rate , chemical abundance , as well as global morphological properties .",
    "a good example of such a sample is the catalog of isolated galaxies ( karachentseva 1973=cig ) which contains 1050 galaxies in the northern sky with blue apparent magnitudes brighter than 15@xmath27 . here , we present a new catalog of isolated galaxies , 2mig , selected from the 2masx part of of the @xmath3- band 2mass survey ( jarrett et al .",
    "2000 , skrutskie et al . 1997 ) , using a modified isolation criterion from cig .",
    "the cig isolation criterion has used the empirically chosen conditions : @xmath4 @xmath5 where indeces `` 1 '' and `` i '' refer to a fixed galaxy and its neighbours , respectively . according to them ,",
    "the galaxy with a standard angular diameter @xmath6 is classified as isolated if all its significant neighbours with their angular diameters @xmath7 locate on the projected distances not closer than @xmath8 .",
    "physically , it means that isolated galaxy did not suffer essential gravitational influence from nearby galaxies during the last billion years . to select isolated galaxies from 2masx we changed the value `` s '' in ( 1 ) from 20 to 30 because the mean ir galaxy diameter is 1.5 times less than the standard optical one , @xmath9",
    "this modified criterion was applied to 51572 2masx candidate galaxies with @xmath10 magnitudes being in the interval @xmath11 @xmath12 hereby , a huge number of 2mass galaxies with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 were taken part in the checking of isolation .",
    "the automatic selection has been performed using the pleinpot environment package developed by the postgresql global development group for reduction and analysis of astronomical data . as a result we obtained a sample of 4045 candidate objects , but 250 of them turn out to be non - galaxies : pns , star clusters and binary stars .",
    "the remaining 3795 were inspected than visually on dss-1 and dss-2 surveys using the conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the galaxies without significant neighbours both in optical and ir bands entered in the `` 2mass very isolated galaxy catalog '' i.e. 2mvig . there are 2493 of the 2mvig galaxies , or 4.8% among 2masx ones satisfying ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "if the significant neighbours have been detected on dss we checked their radial velocities using ned and leda databases .",
    "when the radial velocity difference was less than 500 km / s we excluded such candidate galaxy as a member of pair or group ; the number of these galaxies amounts to 568 .",
    "the remaining 734 galaxies , which have significant neighbours without measured radial velocities , were added to the 2mvig sample as likely isolated ones .",
    "these 3227 galaxies constitute the `` 2mass isolated galaxies '' catalog , 2mig ( karachentseva et al .",
    "the data presented in 2mig are following : ( 1 )  running number , ( 2 )  equatorial coordinates ( j2000.0 ) taken from 2mass , ( 3 )  galaxy name , ( 4 )  angular radius ( a large semi - axis ) @xmath15 in arcsec from 2mass , ( 5 ) ",
    "@xmath10 magnitude from 2mass , @xmath16 , ( 6 )  a dimensionless `` separation '' between isolated galaxy and its nearest significant neighbour , @xmath17 , ( 7 )  heliocentric radial velocity taken from leda or ned , ( 8)  morphological type in de vaucouleurs scale .",
    "the types were estimated visually on dss-1 , dss-2 and sdss surveys , using also the 2mass jhk images for central galaxy regions , ( 9 )  number of significant neighbours of the isolated galaxy detected during our additional inspection on dss .",
    "a blank means that the galaxy belongs to 2mvig , ( 10 )  comments about galaxy morphological peculiarity and its identification in ned with cig , iras as well as the catalogs and lists of active and peculiar galaxies .",
    "the cumulative galaxy number versus @xmath10 magnitude is presented in fig.1 for different samples .",
    "two parallel lines show the homogeneous disribution with the slope of 0.6 @xmath10 .",
    "the isolated 2mig and 2mvig galaxies follow well this distribution except a small lack of bright galaxies due to the local supercluster effect .",
    "therefore , the applied criterion selects about one and the same fraction of isolated galaxies among near as well as distant galaxies .",
    "fig.4 exhibits the number rate distribution of 2mig and 2mvig galaxies by their morphological types .",
    "elliptical and lenticular galaxies amount to about 19% , and a fraction of irregular galaxies does not exceed 1% . on the upper panel of fig.4 we present an appropriate distribution for cig galaxies taken from hernandes - toledo et al .",
    "as seen , 2mig and cig samples contain almost the same fraction of early - type galaxies , but the abundance of the sa , sab types is higher in 2mig in comparison with cig .",
    "it seems quite expected because of a low ability of the ir survey to detect blue diffuse objects ."
