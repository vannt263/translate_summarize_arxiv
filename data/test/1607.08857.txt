    "quantum hall effects are characteristic of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gases in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite is explained in terms of weakly - interacting electrons filling quantized landau levels ( ll ) produced by application of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the 2d gas @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) @xcite can occur only as a result of strong electronic correlations in partially - filled landau levels @xcite .",
    "because of its massless chiral charge carriers and atomic - monolayer honeycomb lattice exhibiting sublattice , valley , and spin degeneracies , quantum hall effects in graphene could be much richer than in the semiconductor 2d electron gas , where there is no crystal structure and the only degeneracies are those of the ( non - relativistic ) landau levels and spin . for graphene in strong magnetic fields an integral quantum hall effect @xcite and a fractional quantum hall effect @xcite have been observed , with anomalous filling factors that reflect the unique degeneracies of the graphene electronic structure and the dirac - like nature of its electrons .",
    "the valley isospin and spin degrees of freedom imply that graphene in a strong magnetic field is described well by a low - energy hamiltonian that commutes approximately with the generators of an su(4 ) lie algebra .",
    "this su(4 ) symmetry allows classification of states in graphene , and can serve as the basis for computing explicit breaking of the su(4 ) symmetry by small non - symmetric terms in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , there is growing evidence that many states observed in modern experiments can not be described by explicit breaking of su(4 ) .",
    "for example , the ground state of graphene in a magnetic field at low temperature exhibits a rapid increase of the longitudinal resistance @xmath0 above a critical magnetic field @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath1 decreases for increasingly cleaner samples , indicating that the resistance is not caused by impurity scattering but instead is intrinsic to the state itself @xcite . in quantum hall systems",
    "the currents are carried by edge states , so this insulating ground state must correspond to an emergent state that does not support edge currents produced by _ spontaneous _ (",
    "not explicit ) breaking of the su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "thus the approximate su(4 ) symmetry of graphene can suggest possible low - energy collective modes exhibiting spontaneously broken symmetry that are important for the properties of graphene in a magnetic field , but the su(4 ) symmetry alone can not determine which of these modes is the ground state .",
    "until now , those broken - symmetry modes have been addressed quantitatively by numerical simulations employing limited numbers of states and particles , or by effective low - energy field - theory approximations .",
    "these calculations find various possible low - energy collective states resulting from spontaneous breaking of the su(4 ) symmetry with very similar energies .",
    "thus they have been unable to give a definitive answer to the nature of the insulating ground state .",
    "let us note that other approaches to the problems addressed here have been proposed ( for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the present discussion will concentrate on methods based on approximate su(4 ) symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "an alternative and potentially more powerful application of symmetries has been employed extensively in both nuclear structure and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "fermion dynamical symmetry method _ truncates the hilbert space to a tractable collective subspace by positing a highest symmetry associated with the physical operators for the system , and constructing effective hamiltonians from polynomials in the casimir invariants of the highest symmetry s subgroup chains . in this approach",
    "it is possible not only to classify low - energy collective modes , but to solve analytically for the properties of these modes and to determine which lie lowest in energy , either exactly in particular symmetry limits , or approximately using generalized coherent state methods .    in an earlier letter the first application of fermion dynamical symmetry methods to graphene",
    "was introduced and applied to determining the ground state in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this paper develops the full dynamical symmetry formalism upon which ref .",
    "@xcite rests .",
    "it will be shown that the highest symmetry is so(8 ) , with its generators identifiable with particle  hole and pairing degrees of freedom that have been discussed previously in the physics of graphene .",
    "this symmetry will be shown to be isomorphic to an so(8 ) symmetry used extensively in nuclear structure physics , which permits already - developed mathematics to be appropriated for the graphene problem , and suggests instructive physical analogies between two very different physical systems .",
    "a generalized coherent state approximation will be introduced that corresponds to a hartree  fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism subject to so(8 ) symmetry constraints .",
    "this permits quantitative evaluation of energy surfaces associated with spontaneously - broken symmetry .",
    "the so(8 ) highest symmetry will be shown to have an su(4 ) subgroup that recovers the known physics of su(4 ) quantum hall ferromagnetism as a special case , but implies in the more general case new low - energy physics that transcends su(4 ) quantum hall ferromagnetism .",
    "hence , a solvable and physically - illuminating approach to the rich low - energy structure of undoped graphene in strong magnetic fields will be proposed that reproduces known physics , but also suggests testable new physics in this complex system .",
    "comprehensive reviews of graphene physics may be found in refs .",
    "the presentation here will recall only a select set of features that will be relevant for subsequent discussion .",
    "undoped graphene is a 2-dimensional semiconductor with zero bandgap .",
    "it has a bipartite honeycomb lattice structure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - b_sublattices ]        that corresponds to two interlocking triangular sublattices , labeled a and b. the two - fold degree of freedom specifying whether an electron is on the a sublattice or b sublattice is a spin - like quantum number termed the _",
    "sublattice pseudospin_. the sublattice pseudospin behaves mathematically like the actual spin of the electron ( which will be introduced later ) , but it is a separate degree of freedom .",

    "[ fig : dispersiongraphene ] .",
    "0pt 0.44 electronic dispersion of graphene calculated in a tight - binding model with no magnetic field .",
    "two inequivalent points in the brillouin zone are labeled @xmath2 and @xmath3 . near these k - points the dispersion becomes linear , leading to _ dirac cones , _ as shown in the expanded view . for undoped graphene",
    "the fermi surface lies at the apex of the cones , where the level density vanishes and the effective electronic mass tends to zero .",
    "thus low - energy electrons are governed approximately by a dirac equation for massless electrons .",
    "the two inequivalent points @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not connected by reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "the corresponding two - fold k degree of freedom may be viewed mathematically as a 2-valued spin - like quantity , commonly termed the _ valley isospin _ because of the valley - like structure in the dispersion of fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersiongraphene ] around the k - points . for brevity",
    "the valley isospin will sometimes be termed simply _ isospin .",
    "_ obviously this two - fold `` isospin '' degree of freedom is a pseudospin that should be distinguished physically from the actual spin of the electron , and from standard usage of isospin quantum numbers in nuclear and particle physics .    near the _ dirac cones _ ( inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : dispersiongraphene ] ) the dispersion is linear , the density of electronic states tends to zero , and the electrons are described by a massless dirac equation in which the fermi velocity plays the role that the speed of light would play in an actual relativistic system .",
    "thus the low - energy electrons for undoped graphene in zero magnetic field behave to good approximation as _",
    "massless chiral fermions , _ with the chirality representing the projection of the sublattice pseudospin on the direction of motion , not the projection of the actual spin .",
    "the vanishing of the density of states at the dirac point ( fermi surface ) implies that the transport properties of graphene are different from either a metal or a semiconductor .",
    "our interest will be primarily low - energy states in a strong magnetic field . for non - interacting electrons ,",
    "the quantized levels may be found by solving the dirac equation for massless fermions with a vector potential appropriate to the applied magnetic field .",
    "the dispersion of energy with magnetic field strength for massless dirac electrons is illustrated in fig .",

    "[ fig : llgraphene_n0](b ) .",
    "the graphene honeycomb lattice is bipartite , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - b_sublattices ] .",
    "the @xmath5 ll is located exactly at the dirac point corresponding to @xmath6 . for low - energy excitations in each valley labeled by @xmath2 or @xmath3 ,",
    "the inter - valley tunneling may be ignored and the electrons in the valley reside entirely on either the a or b sublattice .",
    "hence , for the @xmath5 ll labeling with the valley isospin ( indicating whether the electron is in a @xmath2 or @xmath3 valley ) is equivalent to labeling with the sublattice pseudospin ( indicating whether the electron is on the a or b sublattice ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of a nel state with spins on two different sublattices , with a nel order defined by the difference in spins on the a and b sublattices .",
    "a quantum hall effect is signaled by a plateau in the hall conductance @xmath7 having quantized values @xmath8 where the _ filling factor _ @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 with @xmath11 the charge - carrier density , @xmath12 the magnetic field strength , and @xmath13 the magnetic flux density in units of the fundamental flux quantum @xmath14 .",
    "these plateaus indicate formation of an _ incompressible quantum liquid .",
    "_ this is a compact way to say that the ground state is separated from excited states by an _ energy gap , _ which inhibits compression because of the energy required for excitation across the gap .",
    "the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) in graphene is similar to the integral quantum hall effect for non - relativistic electrons in that it corresponds to the formation of incompressible states resulting from the complete filling of landau levels by weakly - interacting electrons .",
    "however , there are two important differences between the iqhe states observed in graphene and those observed in conventional 2d semiconductor heterostructures :    ( 1 )  in addition to the two - fold spin degeneracy ( in the absence of zeeman splitting ) , there is a two - fold valley degeneracy associated with the distinct @xmath2 and @xmath15 points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "thus the filling factor changes in steps of four between plateaus in the hall resistance for graphene .",
    "( 2 )  for graphene the filling factor @xmath9 defined in eq .",
    "( [ iqhegraph1.1 ] ) vanishes at the dirac point for particle  hole symmetric half filling of the graphene lattice , since the electron density @xmath11 tends to zero there .",
    "hence , in the absence of a zeeman effect or strong electronic correlations , there is no integral quantum hall effect in graphene for @xmath16 .",
    "( a )  relativistic dispersion for massless dirac electrons as a function of magnetic field strength @xmath12 . states are labeled by a principle quantum number @xmath17 and a quantum number @xmath18 indicating particle - like ( @xmath19 ) and hole - like ( @xmath20 ) states .",
    "each landau level labeled by @xmath17 has a high orbital degeneracy @xmath21 ( see eq .",
    "( [ degen1.1 ] ) ) , and an additional 4-fold degeneracy associated with spin and valley isospin .",
    "( b )  one configuration for occupation of the @xmath5 landau level in monolayer graphene .",
    "the splitting and occupation are schematic only .",
    "the ground state would be a superposition of such configurations and in the su(4 ) symmetry limit ( which obtains for coulomb - only interactions ) the 4 levels shown labeled by valley @xmath2 or @xmath3 and spin up or down would be degenerate .",
    "in realistic cases the splitting often is small , suggesting approximate su(4 ) symmetry . ]    in graphene the analog of the integral quantum hall effect was first observed at filling factors @xmath22 by sweeping the field or the carrier density through the landau levels @xcite .",
    "this implies hall resistance quantization for filling factors in the sequence @xmath23 where @xmath11 is the charge carrier density and @xmath17 is the landau level index @xcite .",
    "this sequence is quite different from the integral quantum hall effect sequence observed in other 2d electron gases .",
    "however , it likely results from the same basic physics as the normal iqhe , modified by the 4-fold spin  valley degeneracies of non - interacting , massless dirac electrons .    the period @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ iqhegraph1.2 ] ) is is a consequence of the approximate four - fold degeneracy of the graphene landau level , and the added @xmath25 ( which is not present in non - relativistic 2d systems ) is a berry phase effect that results from the special status of the @xmath5 state for massless dirac fermions : a quantum phase arises at the band degeneracy point associated with precession of the pseudospinor describing the 2-fold sublattice degree of freedom , which modifies the quantization condition for electronic orbits @xcite .",
    "the four - fold near - degeneracy of the landau level follows because the zeeman energy is small compared with the interaction energy , and the pseudospin degree of freedom representing the two inequivalent dirac cones at the corners of the brillouin zone ( k and k@xmath26 ) does not couple to external fields if the two sublattices are equivalent .      because of the dirac - cone dispersion with the fermi level located at the apex of the cones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersiongraphene ] ) , low - energy excitations in graphene occur in regions of reduced electron density , which disfavors electron correlations .",
    "but by placing a strong perpendicular magnetic field on the system the resulting landau quantization ( corresponding semiclassically to requiring that an integral number of debroglie wavelengths wrap around a cyclotron orbit , and implying that an integral number of magnetic flux quanta pass through the area bounded by the orbit ) leads to a bunching of levels into regions of locally high degeneracy separated by gaps . these regions of locally high level density may exhibit conditions more favorable for the development of strong correlations between electrons",
    ".    landau levels ( ll ) become strongly correlated when inter - ll excitations are of sufficiently high energy that they may be neglected and the low - energy excitations involve only intra - ll transitions . then the kinetic energy of the ll is a constant that can be omitted .",
    "this limit of strong electronic correlations has two important physical implications : ( 1 )  the approximate 4-fold spin  valley degeneracy of the graphene landau levels leads to quantum hall ferromagnetic states that will be discussed further below .",
    "( 2 )  the strong correlations can produce incompressible states at partial filling of the ll that are reminiscent of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in semiconductor devices .    after the discovery of the integral quantum hall effect in graphene , experiments performed at higher magnetic field strengths observed fragile quantum hall states at filling factors @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath28 states are thought to be the result of single - particle zeeman splitting of the landau levels but the states at filling factors @xmath29 are thought to be caused by electron ",
    "electron interactions breaking degeneracies of the @xmath5 landau level @xcite .",
    "quantum hall incompressible states having actual fractional filling were later observed at filling factors such as @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the fractional states follow the standard composite fermion model @xcite sequence for filling factors @xmath31 , but only even - numerator fractions are seen for @xmath32 . these sequences , and the energy gaps for the corresponding incompressible states ,",
    "are thought to reflect the interplay of strongly - correlated chiral electrons and the characteristic internal symmetries of graphene that will be discussed further below @xcite .",
    "as has been seen , in the quantum hall effect for 2d electron gases produced in semiconductor devices , two fundamental classes of incompressible states are found :    1 .   those where the requisite gaps are produced by complete filling of landau levels ( fermi energy lying between landau levels ) that are explained by weakly - interacting electrons subject to impurity - scattering localization .",
    "2 .   those where the gaps are produced by strong electron correlations within a partially - filled landau level .    for the normal semiconductor quantum hall effect , the first case is commonly termed the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) , because it leads uniquely to quantum hall plateaus at integral filling factors , and the second case is termed the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , because it is characterized uniquely by quantum hall plateaus at fractional values of the filling factor .    in graphene ,",
    "the anomalous counting implied by the four - fold spin  valley degeneracy for massless chiral fermions modifies this correspondence .",
    "one may again assume incompressible states divided into those that have gaps produced by weakly - interacting electrons filling landau levels completely and those that have gaps produced by correlations within a partially filled level .",
    "however ( 1 )  states of the first class occur at integral fillings but the integers of eq .",
    "( [ iqhegraph1.2 ] ) are not those of the normal iqhe because of the anomalous counting implied by graphene s internal structure .",
    "( 2 )  states of the second class may have either integral or fractional filling factors because of the anomalous counting .",
    "thus iqhe and fqhe may be used as shorthand labels in graphene , but it should be understood that what is meant by `` iqhe '' in graphene is the formation of incompressible states by weakly - interacting electrons completely filling landau levels , and by `` fqhe '' the formation of incompressible states by strongly - correlated electrons in a partially - filled level , irrespective of whether the observed filling factors are integers or rational fractions .",
    "our primary interest in this paper lies in those incompressible states formed by electron  electron and electron ",
    "lattice correlations in partially - filled landau levels , and thus in graphene `` fqhe '' states .",
    "in the normal two - dimensional electron gas produced in semiconductor devices the landau levels can contain @xmath33 states , where @xmath34 is the electronic charge and @xmath12 is the magnetic field .",
    "as has been seen , in graphene there is an additional 4-fold degeneracy associated with the spin and valley degrees of freedom .",
    "it is common to unite these four degrees of freedom in terms of an su(4 ) symmetry that is termed _ quantum hall ferromagnetism ( qhfm ) . _",
    "su(4 ) symmetry for graphene in a strong magnetic field is expected when all four spin and valley levels are degenerate .",
    "two conditions must be satisfied for this condition to be fulfilled .    1 .",
    "landau - level mixing caused by inter - ll electronic transitions must be negligible .",
    "perturbations within a single ll that break the 4-fold spin  isospin symmetry must be small .    the resulting theory predicts quantum hall states that have no analog in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "let us study these states by introducing an effective low - energy hamiltonian exhibiting approximate su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "the two - dimensional electronic spin degree of freedom and the two - dimensional electronic valley ( k ) degree of freedom are most elegantly expressed in terms of independent spin and valley isospin states .",

    "the two largest energy scales for graphene in a strong magnetic field are the landau - level separation and the coulomb energy . at the charge neutral point ( fermi energy for undoped graphene )",
    "the ll separation is approximately three times larger than the coulomb energy , which is in turn considerably larger than any additional terms in the interaction .",
    "therefore , a strategy is adopted here of ignoring excitations between landau levels and projecting onto the @xmath5 ll . at a quantitative level",
    "the landau level mixing can not be ignored ( see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but such an approximation gives the correct qualitative physics and the effect of excluded landau levels can be included to some degree by parameter renormalization , which will be sufficient for our purposes .    within this single landau level",
    "the hamiltonian is assumed to be dominated by a long - range coulomb interaction that is su(4 ) symmetric , with shorter - range interactions in spin and valley degrees of freedom ( originating in both screened electron  electron interactions and electron  phonon interactions ) causing su(4 ) symmetry breaking . to implement this a graphene hamiltonian projected onto the @xmath5 landau level is adopted that was proposed in ref .",
