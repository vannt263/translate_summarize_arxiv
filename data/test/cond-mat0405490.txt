    "modelling of the some social phenomenon using the ising spin system has been of considerable interest in the statistical physics .",
    "one of the important study in this area is undoubtedly the sznajd model @xcite which deals with opinion evolution in closed community . in the sznajd model ,",
    "each site of a one- or two - dimensional lattice carries a spin that can be either up ( republican ) or down ( democrat ) and represent one of two possibilities on any questions .",
    "two neighboring parallel spins i.e. , two neighboring people sharing the same opinion , convince their neighbors of this opinion . if they do not have the same opinion , then either they do not influence their neighbors or they bring their neighbors to the opposite position . in this model ,",
    "the system evolves from one time step to another through a random sequential updating mechanism and it always reaches an overall consensus , i.e. , the system ends up in a fixed point : either all spins point up or all point down .",
    "many variants of this sznajd model are studied .",
    "various rules are defined and discussed in @xcite . in all of them , spins pairs are selected randomly for trying to convince their neighbors .",
    "stauffer stated that most variants of the systems always end up in a fixed point , where all spin are the same , or where the opinions are ordered anti - ferromagnetically in one or two dimensional for these rules @xcite .",
    "memory of the system had been discussed based on the sznajd model with synchronous updating in ref.@xcite . in the case of a system corresponding to a community always going to an overall consensus ,",
    "this situation causes a dictatorship ( all spins parallel ) in the sznajd model .",
    "therefore , to avoid dictatorship one can introduce a small number of non - conformist which are not convinced by the sznajd rule ( schneider @xcite ) , or the sznajd model can be studied in disordered lattices so that this is more realistic since human society does not follow a square lattice with every person having exactly four neighbors .",
    "the simplest case is a diluted square lattice , where every site is either empty or having a single spin @xcite . to simulate political election results ,",
    "the sznajd model was generalized from two different opinion to number @xmath0 of opinions @xcite and also stauffer discussed sznajd model with number @xmath0 of opinions .",
    "he stated that there is reachable consensus for @xmath1 but not for @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a different persuasion process with a continuous spectrum of opinions between 0 and 1 were studied by deffuant et al @xcite .",
    "another generalization of sznajd model to a triangular lattice with spreading of mixed opinion and with the pure antiferromagnetic opinion was studied by chang @xcite , who found the fixed points for all values of initial concentration of down spins for the mixed case of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic opinions .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath3-dimensional sznajd model of consensus finding process was simulated with @xmath4 for the two possible opinions , and the density of never changed opinion ( which correspond to persistent spins in ising model @xcite ) during the sznajd consensus - finding process decays with @xmath5 as @xmath6 were discussed .",
    "it was found that exponent @xmath7 is compatible with the ising value for one dimension although it is not compatible for higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "although , political cases that have two state opinion are quite extreme example , such phenomena appears when a referendum has been made in a community or in a country .",
    "people vote either `` yes '' or `` no '' in a referendum such as election either democrats or republicans in us political conditions .    consequently , it seems that the sznajd model @xcite and its variants @xcite suggests to be able to make the physical model of some sociological or political events like galam s sociophysics models @xcite , although there were resistance against modelling of the some sociophysics events from physicists @xcite .    the intent of this study motivated from sznajd s @xcite , stauffer s @xcite and galam s @xcite papers is to introduce a simple sociophysics model to explain the time evaluation of resistance probability of a closed community against occupation .",
    "everybody knows that human history has been filled with conflicts , invasion or wars among countries or community . in historical age , either some countries ( or community ) have taken over other countries or some countries ( or community ) have been occupied by other countries in a military or different way .",
    "it is difficult to show that a country or a society had been able to stay out of such a process .",
    "of course , conflicts , invasions , occupations and wars are quite complicate phenomen which generally occur on the economical , military , sociological , political , humanity levels etc .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to suppose a sociophysics model comprised of all events in a conflicts , an invasion or a war .",
    "nevertheless , in order to explain the dynamics of some socio - political events , a sociophysical model can be set based on ising spin systems just like sznajd model even though it has to contain some definite limitations . in this study",
    "is considered a process in which a community ( or a country ) is under military occupation . to modelling such an occupation processes , some assumptions , of which",
    "details are given as follows , are considered .",
    "initially , let us consider one - dimensional discrete lattice .",
    "each site carriers a spin , @xmath8 , which is either up or down as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "host people of community and soldiers are represented with spin up ( + 1 ) and spin down ( -1 ) respectively .",
    "down spins are distributed randomly on the lattice governed by volume exclusion principle as seen in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this means that only one person ( host or soldier ) occupies a site .",
    "the number of soldiers is only a small fraction of the total population and then the density of soldiers , @xmath9 ( for one - dimensional model ) , is defined as number of soldiers over total population .",
    "we assumed that there is a over all consensus among host people in the community against occupation even if some exceptions exist .",
    "one expects that host people obey to this consensus at least initially . in this sense",
    ", community behaves as polarized at zero social temperature @xcite against occupation just like ising ferromagnet at zero temperature .",
    "as known , every person may be influenced by others , since they interact with each other in the community .",
    "change of opinions of people can be simply explained by social impact @xcite .",
    "but in our model , soldiers have not been influenced by the host people .",
    "their opinion about justifying the occupation does not change during the occupation process , since they may be stubborn , stable or professional etc . in this sense",
    ", it may be assumed that soldiers behaves like persistent spins in ising spin system @xcite , which are change their orientations corresponding to their opinions .",
    "in addition , mission of the soldiers is not only occupation , at the same time , they also want to convince the host people about justification of occupation .    unlike soldiers , it can be conjecture that host people are influenced by soldiers even though they against occupation .",
    "they are exposed to intensive biased information or propagation , which play a role as persuasion mechanism .    to explain the time evolution of one - dimensional sociophysics models ,",
    "let us concentrate on how our mechanism progresses . at this point",
    ", we shall define a resistance probability to occupation for all people ( host or soldier ) at any site @xmath10 . for any soldier , the resistance probability , @xmath11 ,",
    "could be zero during an occupation process since they believe in the justification of occupation . on the other hand , for host people at any site @xmath10 , the resistance probability @xmath11 is equal to one initially since they obey the community consensus .    in this manner",
    ", soldiers affect neighbors who are host people , in other words , a host at any site @xmath10 is influenced by the neighbors .",
    "effected people may change their own opinions depending on resistance probability of the nearest neighbors about occupation .",
    "namely , the phrase of winner takes all @xcite is invalid herein , they might take only a probabilistic manner .",
    "such a mechanism will depolarize the polarization ( resistance probability ) of all host people .    for the any time step , resistance probability @xmath11 of any host people at site @xmath10",
    "is determined by probability of the nearest neighbors at the previous time as @xmath12\\ ] ] eq.([1 ] ) clearly indicate that past plays an important role in this model .",
    "also , the system evolves from one time step to another through synchronized updating mechanism .",
    "total resistance probability of community will be depolarized by soldiers even if we assumed that community has a consensus about resistance to occupation initially .",
    "total polarization for such a system could be calculated over every host people for any time step @xmath13 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the initial number of host people , @xmath16 represents any configuration and the sum is over all sites .",
    "if eq.([2 ] ) is averaged over different soldier configurations , then it can be rewritten as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of different configurations .",
    "as an example , the schematic representation of the time evolution of resistance probability due to eq.([1 ] ) is written using periodic condition for every spin ( host people and soldiers ) is shown in fig.[fig2 ] . in this figure ,",
    "the first line represents the occupied community , and second line corresponds to its resistance probability at time @xmath19 .",
    "while probability values for soldiers remain unchanged , it decreases for host people as seen in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "evolution of resistance probabilities for each host in time @xmath13 is partly illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "fortunately , eq.([3 ] ) allow us to work with large lattice and over many different configurations .",
    "for this reason , eq.([3 ] ) has been solved numerically for lattice size @xmath20 , and density of the soldier @xmath21 , number of the time step @xmath22 and number of the independent configuration @xmath23 with periodic boundary configuration by using a simple fortran program .    in order to understand clearly the time evolution of one - dimensional sociophysics model under conditions mentioned above",
    ", the numerical data were plotted as @xmath24 versus @xmath13 in fig.[fig3]a , as @xmath25 versus @xmath26 in fig.[fig3]b , as @xmath27 versus @xmath28 in fig.[fig3]c , and also as @xmath29 versus @xmath26 in fig.[fig3]d .",
    "it is explicitly seen from fig.[fig3]a , fig.[fig3]b , and fig.[fig3]c that there are no exponential , power , logarithmic laws dependence in the numerical data , respectively .",
    "but , as seen in fig.[fig3]d , numerical data well fit to stretched exponential function as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 normalization factor , @xmath32 relaxation constant , and @xmath33 is the decay exponent of the averaged resistance probability .    in addition",
    ", it should be tested whether fig.[fig3]d satisfies to stretched exponential or not . if prefactor @xmath31 is equal to 1 in eq.([4 ] ) the fig.[fig3]d would work as stretched exponential .",
    "however , if @xmath31 is less than @xmath34 , small prefactor may give the impression of stretched exponential form , even for @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , it can be plotted @xmath36 versus suitable powers of @xmath13 , like @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . , and find out the best straight line among the powers of @xmath13 for long times ( email from d. stauffer ) .",
    "hence , @xmath36 was plotted versus powers of @xmath13 for @xmath21 then the best straight fitting line for long times was obtained for @xmath39 and @xmath40 as seen in fig.[fig4]a and fig.[fig4]b , respectively .",
    "these results confirm to this method used to find out stretched exponential exponents in fig.[fig3]d .",
    "also , this test indicates that prefactor in eq.([4 ] ) does not effect results presented in this paper .    to see whether the exponent @xmath33 depends on @xmath9 or",
    "not , we plotted @xmath33 versus @xmath9 in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "this figure shows clearly that exponent @xmath33 is a function of density of soldiers . as seen from fig.[fig5 ] , @xmath33 almost linearly decreases .",
    "it is inferred from fig.[fig5 ] that the averaged resistance probability @xmath27 has stretched exponential character independent of @xmath9 .",
    "but , one can not guaranty that it is true for all @xmath9 values . as seen in fig.[fig5 ] , while @xmath33 monotonically decreases for small @xmath9 whereas oscillating occurs in @xmath33 for large @xmath9 values , which indicates that fatal statistical errors may occur for large @xmath9 values .",
    "in all reasoning , it is inferred that numerical results obtained from simple sociophysics model studied herein obey a stretched exponential law independent of the number of soldiers . also , we find out exponent @xmath33 depend on number of soldiers .",
    "these are quite remarkable aspects .    stretched exponential behavior indicates mathematically that decay for the relatively short times is fast , but for relatively long times it is slower .",
    "one can observe that this mathematical behavior corresponds to occupation processes in the real world .",
    "in generally , a military occupation is realized after a hot war .",
    "the community does not react to occupation since it occurs as a result of defeat .",
    "people are affected easily by propaganda or other similar ways .",
    "therefore , it is no surprise that resistance probability decrease rapidly at relatively short times . on the other hand , spontaneous reaction may begin against occupation in the community after the shock .",
    "hence , community begins by regaining consciousness and more organized resistance may display difficulties for occupants . for long times ,",
    "the resistance probability decreases more slowly .",
    "this means that resistance against occupation extends to long times in practice . at this point ,",
    "the number of soldiers is also important , because the density of soldiers determines the speed of decaying .    of course",
    ", the mechanism considered in this work can be regarded as simple , but , it would be useful to understand the time evolution of the resistance probability of the community against to occupation in the one - dimensional model under some considerations .",
    "we noted that more realistic sociophysics model for better understanding the time evolution of resistance against to occupation appearing may be devised on the randomly diluted square lattice , where every site is either empty or carrier one spin which represent a host people or soldier randomly .",
    "also , in that model both host people and soldiers move on the lattice via diffusion .",
    "hereafter , also the sociophysics model mentioned above will be treated in the near future .",
    "finally , it is surprisingly seen that there is a connection simple sociophysics model of which details are given in this paper with one - dimensional random walk processes in the presence of a periodic distribution of traps @xcite . in the both models ,",
    "the resistance probability for any host people and the survival probability for any walker are given by eq.([1 ] ) at any time .",
    "since the time evolution of probabilities in these models arise from the same result , hence , one can suggest that the sociophysics model herein and random walk model on the trapping lattice are likely to be in the same universality class .",
    "i would like to thank to dietrich stauffer for his valuable corrections and contributions about this work ."
