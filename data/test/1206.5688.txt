    "in a couple of experiments , the measurement of the frequencies of collective modes in trapped fermi gases revealed a lot of interesting information on the equation of state , the validity of superfluid hydrodynamics , and the superfluid - normal phase transition @xcite .",
    "more recently , the transition from the hydrodynamic to the collisionless regime in the normal phase was also studied @xcite . however , since the frequencies of the collective modes depend on the trap frequencies , a precise knowledge of the latter is required for a meaningful interpretation of the collective - mode data .    a possibility to determine the trap frequency with high precision is the measurement of the frequency of the sloshing mode @xcite , which is an oscillation of the center of mass of the trapped atom cloud . in a harmonic trap , this oscillation ( also called kohn mode ) is undamped and its frequency coincides exactly with the trap frequency in the corresponding direction , independently of the number of atoms @xmath0 , or their interaction , their temperature @xmath1 etc .",
    "this is a consequence of the kohn theorem @xcite and follows from the fact that the center - of - mass oscillation decouples completely from the internal dynamics of the gas if the interaction is translationally invariant and the external potential is harmonic @xcite .",
    "however , in practice the trap potential is never exactly harmonic . in optical dipole traps",
    "@xcite , the potential is typically gaussian ( corresponding to the intensity profile of the laser beam ) . because of this anharmonicity , the frequency of the sloshing mode",
    "is shifted , and the shift depends on the system parameters such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , the scattering length @xmath2 characterizing the interaction strength , etc .",
    "furthermore , the sloshing mode is no longer undamped .",
    "the anharmonicity of the trap complicates considerably the analysis of collective - mode experiments . in ref .",
    "@xcite the measured frequencies were corrected for the anharmonicity effects by giving them in units of the measured frequency of the sloshing mode .",
    "however , it is clear that the damping rates of the modes can not be corrected in this way . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the damping rate of the sloshing mode was used to estimate the increase of the damping rate of other modes due to the anharmonicity .",
    "both corrections are ad - hoc prescriptions without rigorous justification .",
    "it is therefore strongly desirable to get a better understanding of the anharmonicity effects on the sloshing mode .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to describe theoretically the frequency shift and the damping rate of the sloshing mode in an anharmonic trap .",
    "we will compare our results with the experimental data available from the innsbruck group @xcite and with the numerical results by wu and zhang @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss in detail the damping mechanism of the sloshing mode . in an anharmonic potential ,",
    "the center - of - mass motion is no longer decoupled from the internal degrees of freedom of the cloud .",
    "we will see that the damping of the transverse sloshing mode is a consequence of its coupling to other damped collective modes , in particular to the radial dipole mode and the bending mode .",
    "the framework of our study is the boltzmann equation , including mean field @xcite and in - medium cross - section @xcite .",
    "especially the mean field is expected to be important in the present context , because it can have a sizable effect on the density profile , i.e. , on how far the cloud extends into the anharmonic region of the trap potential .",
    "the boltzmann equation is solved approximately with the help of the phase - space moments method .",
    "this method , when extended beyond the lowest order , has proven to be in very good quantitative agreement with the results of a full numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "it has also been quite successful for the description of the experimental results for the frequency and damping rate of the radial quadrupole mode @xcite . in the present case of the sloshing mode",
    ", we include phase - space moments of first and third order .",

    "as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sloshing mode was studied with the same parameters as the compression mode , i.e. , @xmath94 hz , @xmath95 hz , and @xmath96 @xmath97k .",
    "the trap was loaded with @xmath98 atoms of @xmath99li in the unitary limit , @xmath100 , and the temperature was varied between @xmath101 and @xmath102 . since we can not describe the superfluid phase , we limit ourselves to temperatures above @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we approximate the unitary limit numerically by setting @xmath104 .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the anharmonicity effects depend mainly upon the ratio @xmath105 . defining the fermi energy as usual by @xmath106 ,",

    "[ fig : vtrap ] by the thin dashed line .",
    "we see that , for the present choice of parameters , the atoms start to feel the anharmonicity of the potential when their energy exceeds @xmath108 , while the sixth - order approximation to the potential stays very precise up to about five times the fermi energy .",
    "in order to describe the sloshing motion , say , along the @xmath81 direction , the ansatz ( [ generalansatz ] ) has to contain at least two basis functions : @xmath109 the second term describes the collective velocity of the cloud in @xmath81 direction , while the first one corresponds approximately to a displacement of the center of mass .",
    "the latter statement becomes exact in the special case of a purely harmonic trap without mean field ( @xmath110 ) . in this case , the ansatz ( [ ansatzfirst ] ) is closed with respect to the operator @xmath111 on the left - hand side of the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzlin ] ) , and since the collision term does not contribute ( @xmath112=i[p_x]=0 $ ] because of momentum conservation in a collision ) , the ansatz ( [ ansatzfirst ] ) becomes exact .",
    "however , if the trap is not purely harmonic , this is no longer true , since the gradient of the trap potential generates new terms . and",
    "even if the trap is harmonic , it is not true for interacting atoms , which feel a mean field @xmath113 in addition to the trap potential @xmath37 . in the next section",

    "( [ eq : wk1st ] ) is that the sloshing mode is undamped ( i.e. , @xmath123 is real ) even in the case of an anharmonic potential .",
    "this is , however , only a consequence of the first - order approximation .    a similar calculation was performed in the appendix b of ref .",

    "@xcite because there the mean field was not considered , although the expectation values @xmath126 and @xmath128 were calculated with the density profiles of an interacting gas .",

    "other terms , e.g. , @xmath136 or @xmath137 , describe momentum - sphere distortions .",
    "they give rise to a non - vanishing collision integral so that they generate a damping .",
    "the momentum - independent third - order terms such as @xmath138 describe deformations of the cloud in coordinate space that will be discussed in more detail in the next subsection .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : response ] , the frequency and damping rate should now be extracted from the response function .",

    "the response function is defined as the expectation value @xmath142 .",
    "we checked numerically that , in a purely harmonic potential @xmath143 , the strength function has only a single sharp peak ( no damping ) at @xmath144 within the precision of our calculation ( better than @xmath145 ) , independently of the temperature and of the interaction strength .    in fig .",

    "let us first note that , to first order in the perturbation , the cloud width can not be changed ( neither in the transverse nor in the axial direction ) , because the excitation operator is odd with respect to @xmath163 .    however , the density profile can become skewed in the direction of the oscillation ( i.e. , in the @xmath81 direction in our case ) . for illustration , fig . [",
    "fig : sloshskew](b ) shows how the density profile changes during a radial compressional dipole oscillation . to derive the corresponding operator ,",
    "let us start from the usual definition of the skewness , which is proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "keeping only terms linear in the variations @xmath165 and @xmath166 , and using @xmath167 , we find that for small oscillations , this is equal to @xmath168 . if the trap is axially symmetric , collective modes of different multipolarity in the radial direction do not mix .",
    "it is therefore useful to decompose the operator into dipolar and octupolar parts : @xmath169 with @xmath170 only @xmath171 can get a non - vanishing expectation value during the sloshing oscillation .",
    "another possible distortion involves the axial ( @xmath80 ) direction .",
    "let us consider again the sloshing mode in @xmath81 direction .",
    "then one could imagine that the cloud near @xmath172 , owing to its larger radial size , is more sensitive to the anharmonicity of the trap and therefore oscillates slightly more slowly than the parts of the cloud at large @xmath173 .",
    "hence , after a few oscillations , the oscillations near @xmath172 and at large @xmath173 become out of phase , which results in a bending of the cloud in the @xmath81-@xmath80 plane , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sloshbend](b ) . a suitable measure for such",
    "a deformation is the expectation value of the operator @xmath174 like @xmath171 and @xmath175 , this operator is defined in such a way that it is insensitive to a translation of the cloud as a whole in @xmath81 direction .    within the first - order ansatz ( [ ansatzfirst ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to see that in a harmonic trap without mean field and to linear order in the perturbation , the density oscillates as @xmath176 , with @xmath177 , i.e. , the cloud shape remains unchanged .",

    "( a ) in a harmonic trap , the unphysical skewness and bending of the first - order approximation ( dash - dotted and dotted lines ) are strongly suppressed when the third order moments are included ( solid and dashed lines ) . since in a harmonic trap",

    "owing to the additional degrees of freedom of the ansatz ( [ ansatzthird ] ) , the unphysical change of the cloud shape in the harmonic potential is strongly suppressed , as shown by the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : skewbend](a ) .    while unphysical in a harmonic trap , a change of the cloud shape during the sloshing motion is expected in an anharmonic trap . from the preceding discussion it is clear that at least the third - order ansatz is required to get a meaningful description of this effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig : skewbend](b ) , third - order results for the expectation values of @xmath171 and @xmath185 during the sloshing motion are displayed .",
    "we note that , compared to the third - order results for a harmonic trap , both responses are now significantly increased , so that the peaks correspond to a real physical effect . moreover , the observed shapes are typical of what one can obtain in a schematic model by coupling two damped modes ( dipole and bending ) to an undamped one ( sloshing )",
    ". finally one can also see that the peaks are centered around the sloshing frequency , which is lower than in the harmonic case .",
    "in the previous section we have discussed coupling of the sloshing mode to other collective modes due to the trap anharmonicity . in particular , the ansatz ( [ ansatzthird ] ) contains the necessary terms to describe the transverse compressional dipole and bending modes corresponding to the operators ( [ eq : qdip ] ) and ( [ eq : qbend ] ) . in this section",

    "the response exhibits a characteristic dip due to the coupling between the dipole mode and the almost undamped sloshing mode ( the sloshing is damped mainly because of this coupling ) .    in order to get a better understanding of the character of the two modes in the collisionless regime , we display their velocity fields in fig .

    "the mixing between sloshing and bending mode is weaker than that between sloshing and dipole mode , and the bending response does not show the characteristic dip that was found in the dipole response .",

    "in this paper , we studied the frequency shift and damping of the sloshing mode of a normal - fluid fermi gas in a realistic anharmonic trap potential .",
    "we used the moments method in order to find approximate solutions of the boltzmann equation with mean field and in - medium cross - section . already at first order ,",
    "the moments method predicts a downwards shift of the frequency of the sloshing mode .",
    "however , the first order ansatz is insufficient to describe the coupling between the center - of - mass and the internal degrees of freedom of the gas , which is responsible for the damping of the sloshing mode in an anharmonic trap .",
    "we therefore extended the ansatz to include also third - order phase - space moments .",
    "the third - order ansatz contains not only the sloshing mode , but also more complicated radial dipole and bending modes .",
    "the important mechanism for the damping of the sloshing mode is its coupling to these modes ( especially to the dipole mode ) due to the trap anharmonicity .",
    "in addition , the third - order ansatz allowed us to discuss the radial octupole mode .",
    "the comparison with the available experimental data for the sloshing mode shows that the essential features of the frequency shift can be reproduced .",
    "quantitatively , the calculated ratios @xmath150 are somewhat lower than those given in ref . @xcite .",
    "since both the mean field and the third - order moments give only small corrections to the frequency shift predicted by the first - order moments method , further improvements of the theory will probably give even smaller corrections . an effect which has not been considered in our linear - response study",
    "is the dependence of the sloshing frequency on the amplitude of the mode .",
    "however , this effect goes into the wrong direction , since the restoring force gets weaker with increasing amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vtrap ] ) and therefore the frequency of the sloshing mode will be further reduced ( cf . also @xcite ) . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : extendedansatz ] , a possible explanation of the discrepancy is that the experimental trap frequency @xmath89 may have been slightly underestimated in the analysis of ref .",
    "actually , our results could be used to determine the true value of @xmath89 .",
    "the agreement between the calculated and measured damping rates of the sloshing mode is satisfactory and makes us confident that our approach contains the essential physics to describe the coupling between the sloshing and internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this may also help to better understand other effects where the dissipation of center - of - mass kinetic energy plays a role , such as the heating of the cloud due to laser - beam - pointing noise discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to the sloshing mode , we studied the radial dipole and octupole modes and the bending mode in the @xmath81-@xmath80 plane .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that for these modes the third - order ansatz contains only the leading order , and higher - order corrections can be important .",
    "we found that , with the present trap parameters , the dipole and octupole modes do not behave hydrodynamically at any temperature . the frequencies of the dipole , octupole , and bending modes are more strongly affected by the anharmonicity than the frequency of the sloshing mode .",
    "for the dipole and octupole modes , this can be intuitively understood , since these higher - order modes are more sensitive to what happens at larger @xmath213 , where the atoms feel the anharmonicity of the trap .",
    "the same argument should also apply to the radial quadrupole and scissors modes not studied in the present paper .",
    "one should therefore be careful when comparing theoretical results obtained for a harmonic trap with experimental ones ( as done in @xcite ) , since the anharmonicity effects can not be completely absorbed in a renormalized radial trap frequency .    as a final remark we note that a similar third - order ansatz as the one used here [ eq .",
    "( [ ansatzthird ] ) with @xmath214 can be used to describe one of the higher - order axial modes studied recently by the innsbruck group @xcite ( the @xmath215 mode in the notation of @xcite , corresponding to a motion as shown in fig .",
