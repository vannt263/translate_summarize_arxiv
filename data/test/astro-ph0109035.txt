    "after iras @xcite showed that most galaxies in the nearby universe contain at least some dust , the main question moved from `` whether '' to `` when , where , and how much '' .",
    "`` when '' did galaxies started to be enriched in metals and dust and how did their dust content evolve as a function of redshift ?",
    "`` where '' is the dust located within a galaxy and how is it distributed among hubble types ?",
    "`` how much '' dust there is in galaxies , how much stellar light is absorbed by dust and how is it re - emitted ?",
    "more than one third of the bolometric luminosity of local galaxies is processed by dust into the infrared .",
    "the fraction of stellar radiation reprocessed into the iras 8120  @xmath0 m window is @xmath125%30% @xcite ; this implies an infrared energy fraction around 35%40% of the total bolometric energy within the local @xmath1100  mpc , once bolometric corrections from the iras window to the full infrared range are included @xcite .",
    "this average value comes with a large variation between galaxies , depending on luminosity , morphological type , and activity level ( see section  3 ) .    the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) observed by cobe @xcite sets equally stringent limits on the total amount of stellar energy re - processed by dust into the infrared at _ all _ redshifts .",
    "about half , and possibly more , of the background radiation between 0.1  @xmath0 m and 1000  @xmath0 m is emerging at wavelengths @xmath240  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "this implies that at some epoch(s ) in the past galaxies have been infrared  luminous at least as much as , and possibly more than , today to produce the observed balance between uv / optical and infrared energy in the cosmic background .",
    "bright sources are also found to be about two orders of magnitude more numerous in the past than today ( section  5.2 and * ? ? ?",
    "the infrared luminosity of a galaxy is related to both its dust content and nuclear / star - formation activity .",
    "the lower metal content of distant galaxies does not necessarily make them more transparent systems than galaxies today .",
    "the dust content of galaxies is , in fact , proportional to both metallicity and gas content ; as stellar populations evolve in time and more gas is locked into stars , the metallicity of a galaxy increases while its gas content decreases .",
    "the two trends are opposite to each other , and the dust content reaches a peak sometimes during the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "models predict that galaxies at z@xmath112 have about twice the dust opacity of local galaxies @xcite .",
    "high - redshift , star - forming galaxies are indirectly observed to have large gas column densities ; the average _ sfr per unit galactic area _",
    "increases by more than an order of magnitude between redshift 0 and 3 @xcite , which is indication of a similar increase in the average gas column density via the global schmidt law @xcite .",
    "the presence of dust in galaxies limits our ability to interpret the local and distant universe , because dust extinction dims and redden the galaxy light in the traditional uv  to  near - ir windows , where the vast majority of the data have been obtained .",
    "dust effects hamper the interpretation of galaxies seds in terms of their fundamental parameters , such as age , stellar population mix , star formation rates ( sfrs ) , and stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "since young stellar populations are on average more deeply embedded in dust clouds than older stars , dust opacity variations within a galaxy impact the derivation of a galaxy s star formation history , by altering the census of the populations in the different age bins .",
    "heavy dust extinction in nearby starburst galaxies still prevents establishing whether the stellar imf in these systems is different from that of more quiescent environments @xcite .",
    "the increase of dust content with luminosity in spirals may be responsible for the non - linear behavior of the tully - fisher relation , and this translates into biased distance estimates @xcite .",
    "determinations of luminosity functions , mass - to - light ratios , and number counts , especially at short wavelengths , suffer from both the presence of dust and the variations of dust content from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "light dimming by dust biases measurements of galaxies sfrs , both locally @xcite and at high redshift @xcite , and is the cause of uncertain cross - calibrations between different indicators .",
    "the evolution with redshift of the sfr of galaxies per unit comoving volume is still debated : unclear is whether it has a peak around z@xmath113 @xcite or is mostly flat between z@xmath11 and z@xmath14 @xcite . answering this question , which requires understanding the dust opacity characteristics and the nature of high redshift galaxies ,",
    "can discriminate between different flavors of galaxy formation scenarios @xcite .",
    "finally , measuring the fraction of metals locked into dust at different epochs is a crucial ingredient for tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the quantification of the dust opacity of galaxies of all types and at all redshifts as a function of wavelength has required the collective effort of many investigators over the last @xmath11015  years and is still , in many aspects , an on - going process .",
    "this review attempts to capture the main results obtained so far ; it concentrates on star - forming galaxies , because of their key role for intepreting the star formation history and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the topic has acquired with time large breadth and numerous publications have appeared in the field ; despite the effort to include as many relevant results as possible , some important contributions may have been inadvertenly overlooked .",
    "after iras , the infrared space observatory ( iso ) continued to shed light on the dust emission properties of galaxies , and comprehensive reviews are given in @xcite and in the proceedings of the 1998 paris conference ` the universe as seen by iso ' @xcite .",
    "the status of the topic before iso is reported in the proceedings of the 1994 cardiff ( u.k . ) conference ` the opacity of spiral disks ' @xcite and of the 1996 johannesburg ( south africa ) conference ` new extragalactic perspectives in the new south africa ' @xcite .    throughout the following ,",

    "one commonly used expression of the scattering phase function , the henyey - greenstein function @xcite , is characterized by a single parameter , the asymmetry parameter @xmath17=@xmath18cos(@xmath14)@xmath19 , which is the average of the cosine of the scattering angle .    determining the dust opacity and recovering the intrinsic physical properties of complex systems like galaxies",
    "typically requires the full treatment of the transfer of radiation through dust ( equation  1 ) .",
    "the efforts to solve the integro - differential equation  1 in the case of galactic environments have generated increasingly sophisticated radiative transfer models and codes to deal with the complexity of both the dust physical properties and the dust / emitter geometry .",

    "a detailed description and comparison between these models and codes is beyond the scope of the present review and the interested reader is referred to the papers listed in the table . although the simplifying assumptions implemented in many cases often appear to yield as good a solution as more complex treatments ( see , for instance , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the large number of free parameters is a fundamental shortcoming of radiative transfer models .",
    "workarounds to this shortcoming go from assembling large , coherent sets of independent observational data on just one or a small number of objects to making over - simplistic assumption on the age and metallicity mix of the galaxy stellar populations , and often both .",
    "this clearly bears deeply on the generality and applicability of any result and may account to an extent for the wide variety of conclusions on the opacity of galaxies reached by different authors .      a point - like source ( a star or an agn ) behind a screen of dust is the simplest source / dust geometry , and equation  1 has solution : @xmath20 where i@xmath21 and i@xmath22 are the attenuated ( observed ) and intrinsic radiation intensity , and @xmath23 is the optical depth of the dust screen and a@xmath7 that will be used later . ] .",
    "the total - to - selective extinction , i.e. the part of the optical depth which only depends on the physics of the dust grains and , therefore , only on the wavelength , is often expressed as k(@xmath24)=a@xmath25/e(b@xmath26v ) .",
    "the color excess e(b@xmath26v ) is defined as a@xmath27(b)@xmath26a@xmath27(v ) , hence k(b)@xmath26k(v)=1 .",
    "although many studies traditionally employ a ` mean galactic extinction curve ' to correct galactic and extragalactic sources for the effects of dust obscuration , the well - studied milky way interstellar extinction has been shown to be spatially variable and highly dependent on the dust grain environment along the line of sight ( see reviews of @xcite and @xcite ) . @xcite demonstrated that the variations can be effectively parametrized by the total - to - selective extinction at v , r(v)=a@xmath28/e(b@xmath26v ) .",
    "both the steepness of the far - uv ( @xmath290.3  @xmath0 m ) rise of the extinction curve and the strength of the 0.2175  @xmath0 m absorption feature decrease for increasing r(v ) , as schematically shown in figure  [ fig1 ] @xcite .",
    "most sightlines have r(v)@xmath3026 , with the low values corresponding to the diffuse ism ( for which r(v)=3.1 is a reasonable average value , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) ) and the high values pertaining to dense clouds .",
    "the large values of r(v ) in dense clouds , usually accompanied by a gray extinction curve , are consistent with dust grains having systematically larger sizes than in the diffuse medium @xcite .",
    "the only galaxies external to the milky way for which some measurements of the uv extinction curves exist are the magellanic clouds ( figure  [ fig1 ] ; * ? ? ?",

    "* e.g. , ) , the _ average _ curves of the clouds appear to have some intrinsic differences from the average milky way curve , including a smaller r(v ) ( r(v)@xmath312.42.9 , @xcite ) .",
    "this has been interpreted as an effect of the lower metallicity in the clouds , which causes the molecular clouds to be more diffuse @xcite and , possibly , to produce on average smaller dust grains @xcite .",
    "the weak or absent uv absorption ` bump ' at 0.2175  @xmath0 m in the extinction curves of the lmc 30  doradus region and of the smc bar , respectively , ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) could be related to local processes in these regions , possibly to the ongoing star formation activity @xcite . although the bump carriers have not been positively identified yet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mid and far  infrared studies of star forming regions in the milky way have provided evidence that the environmental uv energy density level affects the dust properties , such as the grain size distribution , via destruction or coagulation , and/or the dust physical characteristics , via ionization state changes @xcite .",
    "thus , the environmental uv energy density appears to play as important a role as the metallicity in shaping the extinction curve .",
    "if confirmed by further observations , this hypothesis may explain the general absence of a 0.2175  @xmath0 m absorption ` bump ' in the extinction curve of starburst galaxies ( section  4.1 ) and may partially account for its weakness in qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition to absorbing stellar light , dust manifests itself through emission and absorption features and continuum emission at @xmath21  @xmath0 m .",

    "beyond 4070  @xmath0 m , the emission is mainly due to dust grains in nearly steady balance with the average heating by starlight ; the transition wavelength between predominance of discrete photon heating versus that of nearly - steady state depends on the average color temperature of the dust and , thus , on the mean uv energy density level of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the original dust model of bare graphite and silicate grains @xcite has evolved over time by including more complex grain compositions and extended grain size distributions , to accomodate all the details of the absorption and emission , and the variability of the environment , while at the same time accounting for the constraints imposed by the heavy elements overall abundance ( * ? ? ?",

    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite , hydrogenated amorphous carbons @xcite , icy and organic refractory mantles @xcite , composite and/or porous grains @xcite , as well as grain size distributions that significantly depart from the original power law model @xcite , have all been suggested as possible alternatives / complements to the graphite / silicate model .      in the late 80s ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite revived the decade - long debate on whether galaxy disks are mainly transparent or opaque to dust . using multi - wavelength information and surface  brightness - versus - inclination tests , respectively , the two groups of authors reached the similar conclusion that the disks of galaxies are fairly opaque , with total face - on extinctions in the b band a@xmath331  mag . ] .",
    "these results countered earlier findings , also based on the surface  brigthness - versus - inclination tests , that galaxy disks are mostly transparent with face - on extinctions at b less than 1  mag @xcite .",
    "the reason why similar approaches can produce very different results can be found in the complexity of the absolute and relative distribution of stars and dust inside galaxies . when there is a significant departure from the simplest geometry of a point source ( a star ) behind a homogeneous screen of dust , the dust distribution , rather than the optical depth of the dust layer , becomes the dominant factor in determining the obscuration suffered by the stellar radiation @xcite .",
    "in particular , differential optical depth effects come into play . if , for instance , the stars are homogeneously mixed with the dust , the shorter the wavelength of the radiation the smaller the optical depth of the dust layer from which it can emerge ; thus , an observer will detect blue light only from the closest outer ` skin ' of the mixed distribution , while redder light will come from deeper layers .",
    "an extreme case is that of infinitely optically thick clumps in front of an extended light distribution : the stellar emission will come only from those lines of sight that do not intersect clumps , and the net result will be an unreddened , albeit dimmer than the original , spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . the scattering component of the extinction curve will also modify the general characteristics of the dust obscuration , as light will be scattered _ into the line of sight _ as well as out of it .",
    "the net result of all these effects is a general blueing of the emerging sed relative to the foreground homogeneous dust screen case , or , in other words , an often much greyer ` effective extinction ' , even in the presence of large dust optical depths @xcite .    for illustrative purposes , figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ]",

    "these @xmath35 and @xmath36 values are assumed here to be representative of dust properties , although the following caveats need to be kept in mind : some values , especially for the albedo , are still unsettled @xcite ; the generalization of the reflection nebulae results ( r(v)@xmath193.1 ) to the diffuse dust is not immediate @xcite ; the uv @xmath35 and @xmath36 values could be lower in the magellanic clouds than in the milky way @xcite . ] . in all cases ,",

    "when multiple line ratios widely separated in wavelength are available , they can constrain the dust geometry in the sampled wavelength range .",
    "the two drawbacks of using nebular lines are : ( 1 ) they are produced by ionizing photons , therefore an ionizing stellar population needs to be present in the galaxy ; and ( 2 ) they only probe the attenuation of the _ ionized gas _ , and such attenuation may or may not be directly related to that of the stellar population ( section  4 ) .",

    "degeneracies between the reddening induced by dust and that induced by variations in the age , metallicity , and imf of the stellar populations play an non - negligible role in opacity determinations of galaxies .",
    "these effects are especially important when only broad band colors or low resolution spectroscopy are available , and age - sensitive or imf - sensitive stellar features are not identifiable ( e.g. , discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "thus , the dusty , young population can be mistaken for a dust - free population a factor @xmath13 older .",

    "efforts to determine the dust opacity of local galaxies have spawned the development of a number of independent techniques that have been applied to a large array of samples .",
    "the most widely used methods in the case of galaxy disks are tests of the dependence of the surface brightness on inclination , multi - wavelength comparisons , and statistical analysis of the color and number count variations induced by a foreground galaxy onto background sources .",
    "each method has its strengths and weaknesses , as briefly detailed below .",
    "as @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite pointed out , probing galaxy dust opacity by measuring the surface brightness dependence of galaxy disks on inclination can suffer from drastic selection biases . for increasing inclination , an apparent - magnitude - limited catalog will mimick the condition for transparent galaxies , with mildly increasing surface brightnesses , increasing diameters , and constant total luminosities .",
    "conversely , an apparent - diameter - limited catalog will mimick the conditions for opaque disks , with roughly constant surface brightnesses , increasing magnitudes and constant diameters as a function of increasing inclination @xcite .",
    "selection effects can , however , be controlled by combining different samples and by using galaxy redshifts / distances to discriminate among the different biases , and analysis of large samples of late - type ( mainly sbc and sc ) spirals @xcite has shown that the central regions of disk galaxies are opaque while the external regions beyond 23 scale lengths are almost completely transparent ; there is also a trend for luminous galaxies to be more opaque than less luminous galaxies @xcite . in bright ,",

    ".    qualitative results similar to those above have been obtained by @xcite and @xcite for a small number of edge - on late - type spirals using multi - wavelength kinematic information .",
    "the method , proposed by @xcite , consists of comparing rotation curves of an edge - on galaxy at widely different wavelengths .",
    "if the edge - on galaxy is optically thick at a given wavelength , say , h@xmath42 , the rotation curve measured at this wavelength shows apparent solid body rotation throughout the entire disk , because the h@xmath42 emission is coming only from the external regions of the galaxy . a comparison with a mostly unextincted rotation curve measured at a longer wavelength , such as hi ,",
    "can then establish whether optical thickness at h@xmath42 exists .",
    "this method , though fairly direct in principle , may suffer from two limitations : first , dust in galaxies tends to be patchy and the h@xmath42 emission may be detected along the least extincted sight lines even in the presence of considerable opacity ; second , the method implicitly assumes that h@xmath42-emitting regions are uniformly distributed across the disk .",
    "the multi - wavelength comparison method provides an independent approach to the problem of determining the dust opacity of galaxies . in broad terms , the technique consists of using multiwavelength data to solve simultaneously for the intrinsic colors of the stellar populations and for the reddening / attenuation induced by the dust .",
    "generally , broad band images covering as large as possible wavelength baseline , often from b to k band , are used to determine the opacity of the disks , by exploiting the differential extinction property of dust @xcite .",
    "indeed , in face - on quiescent galaxies k - band emission appears negligibly affected by dust obscuration , with @xmath5710% of the light lost to dust absorption and scattering @xcite .",
    "the multiwavelength technique is the most widely adopted for measuring dust opacity in galaxies , because it employes easily accessible information on diverse galaxy types , and enables detailed modelling of optical depths as a function of galactic region .",
    "there are , however , three main weaknesses to the method : first , this technique needs as wide a wavelength coverage as possible , often difficult to obtain , to yield unambiguous results ; second , if the dust optical depth exceeds unity at some wavelength , different volumes of the galaxy will be sampled at different wavelengths ; third , the need for large datasets and detailed modelling makes obtaining results on large samples relatively cumbersome .",
    "results vary from author to author , due to the different sample selections , galaxy and dust distribution models , and measurement techniques applied .",
    "optical and near - ir image analysis gives typical central optical depths @xmath38(0 ) in the range 0.32.5 for types sab - sc @xcite , although higher values have been obtained by @xcite .",

    "energy balance estimates between dust absorption and emission can also be classified as a ` multiwavelength technique ' , but it is conceptually different from the one above .",
    "this technique employes direct measurements of the dust emission in the infrared to derive an estimate of the total stellar energy absorbed by dust , and then derive opacities at shorter wavelengths ; whenever possible , the wavelength baseline is extended to the uv to probe the direct light from massive stellar populations and constrain bolometric quantities @xcite . by combining uv and infrared ( iras ) data , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",

    "this is not incompatible with those results , since @xcite and @xcite s models assume plane - parallel dust and stars , instead of exponential profiles , and thus the opaque inner regions are averaged with the nearly transparent outer regions @xcite .",
    "still , the uv selection of the samples may bias the conclusions towards lower optical depths and the use of iras data leaves some uncertainty as to the bolometric correction of the dust emission .",
    "the use of iso data , that extend the infrared wavelength coverage out to 200  @xmath0 m , appear indeed to favor higher values of the effective extinction @xcite .",

    "the drawbacks of this approach are twofold : ( 1 ) there are very few known pairs of galaxies that fullfil all the requirements and ( 2 ) the method is limited by the degree of symmetry of both galaxies @xcite .",
    "the second approach uses distant galaxies as background light sources .",
    "statistical variations in number counts and colors of the background galaxies relative to control fields provide a handle on the total dust optical depth of the foreground galaxy @xcite .",

    "results from various authors indicate that the spiral arms of galaxies tend to be opaque with a@xmath670.52  mag and a@xmath680.31.5  mag at any radius , while the opacity of interarm regions decreases with increasing distance from the galaxy center , starting at a@xmath690.7  mag within 0.3  r@xmath70 and decreasing to practically zero at r@xmath70 @xcite .",

    "uv and optical  selected , intermediate and high redshift , galaxy surveys carry the inherent limitation that physical parameters directly derived from the observations are affected by dust in a non - easily quantifiable way .",

    "estimates of the sfrs in intermediate and high redshift galaxies using balmer lines @xcite and infrared emission @xcite are generally a few times higher than the analogous estimates using the restframe uv emission @xcite . as discussed in section  5 , presence of dust in galaxies at cosmological distances is reasonably established , but the quantification of its effects as a function of redshift is still an ongoing process . linked to this",

    "for reference , a list of @xmath118 values for dust - free stellar populations , both for instantanous burst and for constant star formation , is given in table  [ tbl-6 ] .",
    "an convenient definition of the uv - slope for studies of high - redshift galaxies is @xmath202 , measured roughly between @xmath10.12  @xmath0 m and @xmath10.18@xmath0 m . at z@xmath13 , the optical window give information shortward of @xmath10.2  @xmath0 m , thus forcing the uv slope fitting to a much shorter range than possible with local galaxies .",
    "the details of the actual wavelength range vary with redshift and with the observing technique ( whether spectroscopy or imaging , and depending on the filters used ) .",
    "the relation between the three quantities , as given by models of stellar populations reddened by the starburst obscuration curve of section  4 , is : @xmath203 @xmath204 the error bar following each coefficient refers to the maximum variance observed by varying a number of parameters in the models and fits : ( a ) stellar populations from both @xcite and @xcite models ; ( b ) stellar populations with constant star formation in the range 51000  myr , and instantaneous bursts in the age range 512  myr ; ( c ) both 0.2  z@xmath37 and z@xmath37 metallicities ; ( d ) fitting windows that progressively include or exclude weak absorption lines in the spectra .",
    "the latter turns out to be the main driver of the variance , while changes in the characteristics of the stellar populations have only a small impact .",
    "the relations between the three slopes would , however , change from equations  ( b1)(b2 ) if more extreme cases of stellar population mix , such as the addition of an old ( age@xmath191  gyr ) component , were considered ; in this case , @xmath41 and @xmath118 would be strongly affected , because of the long wavelength baseline .    of interest for high - redshift studies",
    "is the consideration that while @xmath118 and @xmath41 follow each other closely , @xmath202 is always redder ( more positive ) than the other two , and the discrepancy increases for increasing value of the slopes .",
    "the reason for this counter - intuitive behavior is the presence of the well - known ` iron curtain ' at long uv wavelengths : this is a wide dip in the 0.230.28  @xmath0 m range of the uv spectra due to the presence of a large number of closely spaced fe absorption lines @xcite .",
    "the uv slopes fitted with the longer wavelength baseline have windows in this continuum - depressed region , hence their more negative values .",
    "increasing dust obscuration affects the short - wavelength slope more than the long - wavelength ones ; hence the trend for @xmath202 to become progressively redder than @xmath118 as their values increase ( i.e. , as the uv spectra become more dust reddened ) .",
    "@xcite derive an empirical relation between @xmath118 and a short - wavelength uv slope @xmath205 ( close , but not identical , to @xmath202 ) from iue spectra of the uv - selected starbursts . their findings , that @xmath118=@xmath2060.16 , are consistent with the long wavelength slope being bluer than the short wavelength one .",
    "however , they do not measure an increasingly redder @xmath205 for increasing values of both slopes .",
    "a possible reason is that noise in the iue data may have prevented the detection of such effect . in this review",
    ", it is assumed that equations  ( b1)(b2 ) are valid for uv - selected starbursts .",
