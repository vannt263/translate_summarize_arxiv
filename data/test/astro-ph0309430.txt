    "narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) form a special class of active galactic nuclei .",

    "such a steep soft x - ray spectrum of a roughly power law shape may form either as a result of comptonization ( e.g. czerny & elvis 1987 ) by a moderately hot material ( in comparison with the very hot plasma responsible for the hard x - ray component in normal seyfert 1 galaxies ) or as a result of reflection by a strongly ionized material ( e.g. czerny & .",

    "we point out , after krolik ( 2001 ) , that the warm absorber may not be the slab of constant density matter , but it is rather the distribution of regions with different densities and temperatures . such a multi - phase mixture of gas can exist under constant pressure , as a result of thermal instabilities ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ) .",

    "ton s180 was observed with the _ chandra _ satellite in december 14 , 1999 , for about 80 ksec in low - energy transmission grating in acis - s / letg configuration , as described by turner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and turner et al .",
    "the resolution of letg corresponds to an @xmath10 km s@xmath1 for the range of energies from 0.1 up to 6 kev .",
    "the source luminosity at this epoch ( 210 kev unabsorbed flux equal @xmath11 erg s@xmath1 @xmath6 and 0.310 kev unabsorbed flux equal @xmath12 erg s@xmath1 @xmath6 ) was comparable to that during the _ beppo - sax _ observation ( 210 kev : @xmath13 erg s@xmath1 @xmath6 ; comastri et al . 1998 ) and _ xmm - newton _ observation ( 0.3 - 10 kev : @xmath14 erg s@xmath1 @xmath6 ; vaughan et al .",

    "we obtained the data from the chandra archive .",
    "the data were processed with the standard cxc data processing pipeline ascdsver 6.7.0 .",
    "we analyzed the data using ciao version 2.2 . and follow grating analysis thread ( cxc web page ) to extract the spectrum and create appropriate effective area files ( arf files ) .",
    "we combined both sides of the first order spectrum .",
    "we used calibration data base version caldb  v.2.14 , in particular we applied acisd1997-04-17qen0003.fits , quantum efficiency file and acisleg1d1999-07-22rmfn0002.fits as response matrix .",
    "this formally allows us to study the entire energy range between 0.12 till 12.2 kev , although calibration uncertainties are higher below 0.3  kev , while the effective area drops significantly above @xmath16 kev . after removing bad pixels and rebinning the data to achieve at least 20 counts per channel we examined the energy between 0.18 and 6  kev .",
    "all spectral fits have been performed with the xspec 9.0 fitting package .",
    "since the begining of the _ chandra _ mission acis - s detector has been accumulating a layer of a contaminant which affects any measurements at low energies ( below @xmath17  kev ) .",
    "detailed effects of the contaminant are still being investigated by the chandra x - ray center , however , it is clear that the overall degradation of acis quantum efficiency and presence of additional absorption features is time dependent .",
    "ton s180 was observed at the day 143 of the _ chandra _ mission and based on the currently available calibration data we expect that the instrument shows maximum of @xmath1840 - 15 % degradation within 0.28 - 0.6  kev range ( i.e. maximum @xmath19 % in 0.28  kev and @xmath20 % in 0.6  kev ) . in the following we identify the possible absorption features due to the absorber in ton s180 using the entire available energy range .",
    "we note here that some of the features at energies close to the edges of the contaminant ( c , n , o , f k - edge ) may be affected .",
    "we use the available model , acisabs , to include the contamination effects in the analysis .",
    "in the first step , we fit the @xmath21 value of galactic absorption together with a broken power law continuum . our best fit value of @xmath22 @xmath6 is slightly larger than galactic absorption @xmath23 @xmath6 determined by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and used by comastri et al .",

    "all fitted parameters for `` plain continuum '' are listed in table  [ tab0 ] .    in the next step",
    "we fit broken power law with value of galactic absorption fixed at @xmath25 @xmath6 ( see table  [ tab0 ] second line ) .",
    "it results in slightly higher @xmath26 , but the power law index below 2 kev is @xmath27 , and agrees with the best fit slope @xmath28 presented by comastri et al .",
    "1998 for beppo sax data .",
    "lower value obtained by turner et al .",

    "the energy break obtained by us in both models ( about @xmath30 kev ) is somewhat lower than the value determined by comastri et al .",
    "1998 ( @xmath31 ) , but the spectral slope above this energy break , @xmath32 agrees with results comastri et al .",
    "1998 .    since both broken power - law indices are very similar to those obtained from other satellites we adopt second model ( fixed galactic absorption ) for further analysis , leaving @xmath33 per 1682 d.o.f .",

    "therefore , we have tried to determine column density of this gas in the simplest way , by fitting ovii , oviii , and cvi edges often seen in seyfert galaxies ( mrk 509 yaqoob et al .",
    "2002 , ngc 3783 kaspi et al .",
    "surprisingly , such edges appeared to be very weak in the data of ton s180 .",
    "we were able only to give upper limits for @xmath47 @xmath48 , and @xmath49 of order of @xmath50 , which practically indicates the lack of those edges .",
    "x - ray absorption lines appear to be common feature in many agn .",
    "the widely acceptable explanation is the existence of warm , ionized gas which is illuminated by the energetic radiation from nucleus . trying to find properties of warm absorber we need proper tools to fit those data .",
    "till now , models of absorption by the partially ionized plasma available in xspec ( absori , photo , ) do assume slab with constant density .    in absori ,",
    "the radiative transfer of lines is not computed at all , only photoionization cross sections are determined and absorption `` on the spot '' is computed @xmath51 ( done et al .",
    "constructed by kinkhabawa et al .",
    "( 2002 ) local photo model ( http://xmm.astro.columbia.edu/research.html ) neglects photo - electric absorption , but allows for individual line absorption , treating each ionic column density separately with an initially unabsorbed power law .",
    "this method produces consistent results only when absorbing matter is optically thin , and transmitted spectra do not display photo - electric edges .",
    "furthermore , they have assumed that plasma is optically thin to reemitted photons .    in the aim to find evidences for warm absorber in ton s180 , we have applied absori to our data . allowing for three parameters to be fitted in this model , @xmath26 decreases by 38 ( now reduced @xmath52 ) .",
    "the fit indicates that the medium has column density @xmath53 @xmath6 and ionization parameter ( @xmath54 ) for the fixed default temperature @xmath55 k. this model , however , leaves considerable residual trends and does not allow for a deeper insight into the ionization state of the absorbing material .",
    "it is not surprising since the model is based on simple computations of photoionization cross sections without accurate transfer through the medium .",
    "we have applied photo to our analysis .",
    "the model again indicates very low column densities of each ion , about @xmath56 @xmath6 for cvi , ovii , and oviii .",
    "we conclude that most probably , the warm absorber in ton s180 is more complicated than optically thin constant density slab . it may be the stratified density gas , where accurate radiative transfer , including all photoionization processes , should be calculate to model transmitted spectrum .",
    "such models are not available for fitting the data yet , so two or three separate absorbers with different constant densities and ionization states are used together to explain spectral features in some agn ( kaastra et al .",
    "2002 , kaspi et al .",
    "this motivates us to present in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] the model of the multi - phase gas with stratified density and temperature , where the radiative transfer of incident power law is carefully computed .",
    "the model is not ready for fitting yet , but gives interesting results based on equivalent widths of various lines .",
    "observed line properties in the ton s180 data are determined in the section below .",
    "more advanced modeling was done with the code xstar ( developed by kallman & krolik 1999 ) which allows to estimate the total column densities of absorbed gas .",
    "models are computed assuming constant density slab .",
    "such models are very useful for reconstruction of the flat part of curve of growth ( yaqoob et al .",
    "2002 ) , and for subsequent estimation of turbulent velocities of the absorber .",
    "nevertheless , at the last stage of analysis separate gaussian components are fitted to the data .",
    "we have successfully fitted several absorption lines using standard gaussian model for each line separately ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : cont ] , [ fig2:cont ] , [ fig3:cont ] , [ fig4:cont ] , [ fig5:cont ] , [ fig6:cont ] , and [ fig7:cont ] .",
    "* gaussian fit requires three free parameters , energy of the line centroid , gaussian width and normalizations , which has to be negative in case of absorption lines .",
    "* we include in the fit only those features which are significant .",
    "all absorption lines are presented in table  [ tab1 ] . for each line",
    "we list its central energy in kevs , equivalent width ( ew ) in evs , the decrease of @xmath26 , best identification with observed and rest frame energy , and with possible blends .    some of those lines , especially the softest ones , may be caused by dust presented on chandra mirrors .",
    "this should show up a common feature in all objects even those with different redshifts . to check whether lines are real or instrumental , we compare observations of ton s180 with _",
    "chandra _ data of quasar 3c273 observed two weeks latter with the same configuration as ton s180 .",
    "exemplary residuals ( for soft range between 0.2 - 0.24 kev ) for both objects are shown in fig .",
    "[ por:22 ] . in both cases local power - law",
    "was fitted with fixed value of galactic absorption appropriate for each object . the same features around energy 0.22 kev are present as well in 3c273 with redshift 0.156 as in ton s180 .",
    "we repeated such analysis in the whole energy range .",
    "all possible instrumental lines are labeled in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "some of the detected features are seen only in ton s180 spectrum and therefore seem to be real , intrinsic to the source .",
    "for example , in fig  [ por:44 ] we show that line cvi with observed energy 0.4428 kev which is detected in ton s180 data is not seen in 3c273 .",
    "lines are very faint .",
    "they usually have equivalent width less or about 2 evs , and several of them are just marginal detections , as clearly seen from the line ew error , given at 90% confidence level ( * each error is computed for the one parameter of interest * ) .",
    "only two of them are stronger , but from theoretical predictions by analysing our modeled spectra from sec  [ sec : mod ] , they are not blends .",
    "all possible blends according of our modeled specta obtained with spectral resolution 100 are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "there is therefore no major discrepancy between the _ chandra _ results and the _ xmm _ observations ( vaughan et al .",
    "2002 ) where only upper limits of order of 1 ev at energies 0.35 - 0.7 kev were provided .",
    "most lines originate from hydrogen or helium like ions indicating that matter is highly ionized .",
    "there is an absence of lines from mildly ionized spices .",
    "interestingly , we found two different transitions from the same element at the given ionization level , ( cvi@xmath57 and cvi@xmath58 where i  j denotes number of levels from and to which the transition proceeds ) .",
    "this is helpful in the aim to estimate the optical thickness of cvi ions and then total optical thickness of the warm absorber .",
    "if the medium is optically thin in those lines ( i.e. weak line case ) , we are on the linear part of the curve of growth , where equivalent width is proportional to the column density @xmath59 of the absorbed ion : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the oscillator strength transition and stimulated emission has been set equal to unity .",
    "thus , for the given population of ions at the same ionization level , the ratio of equivalent widths is given by : @xmath62 since the oscillator strengths are strictly atomic features independent from the radiation field and are calculated theoretically we use them to find the ratio @xmath63}{ew[{\\rm c vi}_{(1 - 5 ) } ] } =   29.86 .",
    "\\label{equ : tra}\\ ] ] on the other hand , the same ratio determined for ton s180 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) equals @xmath64 .",
    "error is computed assuming most pessimistic case , when numerator has its maximal value @xmath65 , and denominator has its minimal value @xmath66 .",
    "although the error is huge , the value of the ratio determined from observation is still far from theoretical predictions for optically thin medium ( eq .  [ equ : tra ] ) .",
    "our theoretical spectra ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : mod ] ) suggest that c@xmath57 line is possibly a blend with mgxii , sixiv and most strongly with cv .",
    "we have computed that real ew of the c@xmath57 line can be even up to four times lower than the ew of the whole blend .",
    "but this fact even lowers the observed ratio of ews of two carbon lines .",
    "the straight conclusion is that the emitting region is optically thick for those lines and the transfer in lines should be taken into account for proper modeling of the warm absorber .",
    "it is also possible that the identification of the lines is not correct or the line is a blend of the carbon line with another transition .",
    "nevertheless , we further explore the possibility that the carbon line ratio is determined correctly .",
    "therefore , the equation  [ equ : column ] gives only a lower limit for the ion column density , equal to @xmath67 @xmath6 from the cvi@xmath57 line and @xmath68 @xmath6 from cvi@xmath58 , which under assumption of all carbon being in the form of cvi ions and with solar abundances translates into the lower limit for the warm absorber column equal @xmath69 @xmath6 and @xmath70 @xmath6 , correspondingly .",
    "exact determination of the column density is complicated . at the flat curve of growth",
    "we need additional information about velocity dispersion @xmath71 to indicate column densities .",
    "in the case of considered data this is very difficult , because @xmath72 error of full width of half maximum ( fwhm ) is too high to estimate @xmath71 parameter .",
    "for instance for sxii line , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3:cont ] , @xmath73 km / s .",
    "this fact also precludes us to integrate over fitted line profile in the aim of determining exact flux emitted in this line .",
    "so , we are unable to compute exact optical depth of the line and therefore the column density of absorbing ion .",
    "the number of lines is to small to fit full model ( for instance xstar ) .",
    "another lower limit on column density of cvi ion can be derived knowing that the optical thickness of the cvi lines is higher than 1 .",
    "in such a case we can write : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the temperature of the medium and @xmath76 is atomic mass of the ion . for the cvi@xmath58 line",
    "we obtain : @xmath77 for the temperature approximately equal to @xmath78 k this value is twice higher than the one determined by mason et al.(2002 ) in case of mrk 766 .",
    "this limit is over an order of magnitude weaker than the limit obtained directly from equation  [ equ : column ] .",
    "fwhm estimated from the @xmath79 k is quite narrow and the line width is rather determined by much larger turbulent motion .",
    "the value of reduced @xmath26 was equal 0.6363 after fitting all possible absorption lines .",
    "after absorption lines have been identified , we were able to fit a few emission lines from an accretion disk .",
    "we applied the standard diskline model with fixed power law index in the radial dependence of the irradiating flux @xmath80 .",
    "we assumed @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 ) .",
    "we have found the best value of inclination angle @xmath84 for the line cv , and we adopted it ( keeping frozen ) for the other lines .",
    "results are listed in table  [ tab2 ] , and shown in figs .  [ fig : cont ] , and [ fig8:cont ] .",
    "the last column of table  [ tab2 ] presents theoretical values of ews of the same emission lines computed for accretion disk illuminated by hard x - ray flux equaled to the local disk flux ( full model presented in raska et al .",
    "2002 a , b ) .",
    "the model takes into account harder incident radiation ( @xmath85 ) , than it is seen in case of ton s180 , and solar metal abundances . for moderate illumination in the model",
    "we have found for instance the equivalent width of nex equal 11 ev , oviii equal 18.2 , mgxii equal 10.5 , and fexvii about 8 ev , or many others at the same order of magnitude in respect to the reflected continuum ( factor of 2 - 3 smaller in respect to the total continuum ) .",
    "models do not predict lines with ews higher than @xmath86 evs , when the disk is in the hydrostatic equilibrium ( raska et al . 2002 a , b ; see also figures in nayakshin , kazanas & kallman 2000 , ballantyne , ross & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "higher values can be only obtained from constant density medium , as discussed by ballantyne , ross & fabian ( 2002 ) , particularly when adopting enhanced metalicity .",
    "emission lines also become by a factor of a few stronger when the dynamical flare model is adopted , i.e. the time - scale of the flare is shorter than the time - scale for a disk surface layer to achieve a hydrostatic equilibrium ( collin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , in that case lines should be narrow and not represented well by a diskline shape .",
    "soft disk line detection is therefore a promising tool to constrain the conditions within the cold reprocessing medium .",
    "detection of standard broad disk lines presented in this paper , if real , suggest no strong departure from hydrostatic equilibrium and the extension of the cold disk roughly down to the marginally stable orbit .",

    "in order to draw attention to the possible constraints resulting from detection of the broad disk lines we model the broad band spectrum of ton s180 assuming three basic spectral components : ( a ) an illuminated accretion disk ( b ) an optically thick comptonizing plasma ( c ) an optically thin ( non - thermal ) comptonizing plasma . for low or moderate accretion rate",
    "we take the simplest keplerian disk model , emitting locally as a black body and parameterized fully by the black hole mass , @xmath162 , and accretion rate , @xmath163 , given in eddington units ( taking efficiency 1/12 appropriate for newtonian model ) .",
    "we consider also highly supercritical accretion disk applying the model described by kawaguchi ( 2002 ) .",
    "this model includes the effect of strong radial advection and the departure from the local black body emission due to electron scattering which are essential at very high accretion rates .",
    "we assume that the energy generated in the inner disk illuminates outer disk , with the irradiating flux @xmath164 , with @xmath165 .",
    "this irradiation effect may come from the scattering of the disk radiation back toward the disk by the warm absorber as well as from the direct interception of the radiation by the flaring outer disk .",
    "we adopted a simple parameterization and did not model this irradiation since the process is quite complex",
    ". it would require assumption about the radial and angular distribution of the density of the scattering medium ( see e.g. kurpiewski et al .",
    "1997 ) and the computations of the viscosity dependent disk vertical structure , as in raska et al .",
    "we did not compute the disk vertical structure in order to verify whether the outer disk is flaring strongly enough to allow for such a strong effect .",
    "we assume that the inner disk for ( @xmath166 ) is fully covered by the optically thick plasma .",
    "thermal plasma parameters are : the optical depth , @xmath167 , and the temperature , @xmath75 .",
    "only soft photons from the inner disk come through this plasma , and we compute the spectrum using the simple code based on sunyaev & titarchuk ( 1980 ) description ( used for example by collin - souffrin et al .",
    "we adopt the plane parallel geometry and the generation of the photons at the bottom of the zone .",
    "this component forms a soft x - ray component of the spectrum .",
    "we next added a contribution from much hotter , or non - thermal , plasma component in order to provide the appropriate hard x - ray tail but the parameters of this component are poorly constraint and we do not address this issue in detail .",
    "our model provides a one - parameter family of solutions for the broad band spectrum , i.e. we can find a good model for any mass of the black hole between @xmath168 and @xmath169 , but for a fixed mass all other parameters ( @xmath163 , @xmath170 , @xmath167 , and @xmath75 ) are uniquely determined .",
    "the appropriate accretion rate is needed to reproduce the normalization of the spectrum in the optical band , where it is mostly given by the product of @xmath171 ( for illumination case ) .",
    "the value of @xmath170 must be chosen in order not to overproduce / underproduce far - uv flux .",
    "the slope of the soft x - ray spectrum gives one constraint on the combination of @xmath167 and @xmath75 , but for low values of @xmath75 which are always derived the normalization of the soft comptonized spectrum also depends significantly on the plasma parameters ( for a number of soft photons already specified by @xmath170 ) .",
    "examples of the solution are therefore as follows : for @xmath172 : we have @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 kev , and for high accretion rate case : @xmath177 : we have @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 kev ; the broad band data fit for the largest mass is shown in fig .",

    "plasma parameters are such that they make formation of any emission lines rather difficult .    in the case of high mass",
    "the inner disk does not really have to be covered , as indicated by much smaller value of @xmath170 .",
    "clumpy corona model would be easily applicable to this case , or even the x - ray emission could come from some shocks in outflowing material at the rotation axis",
    ". the fraction of the disk covered may be always further reduced assuming that synchrotron emission of the plasma itself provides additional soft photons . in such a case the lines from the irradiated disk are easily expected .",

    "the upper limit is not firm since it is sensitive to the adopted turbulent velocity as well as abundances .",
    "the _ chandra _ data show that the effect of the warm absorber does not modify significantly the x - ray spectrum in the case of ton s180 .",
    "therefore our analysis do not change the overall picture of the ton s180 continuum , as shown by turner et al .",

    "( 2002 ) in favor of hybrid plasma model ( thermal plasma being responsible for the soft x - ray slope and non - thermal plasma component leading to hard x - ray power law ) are convincing .",

    "( 2002 ) , so in the present paper we have used much simpler model in order to draw attention to the possible constraints resulting from detection of the broad disk lines .",
    "those emission lines can be present in the broad band spectrum rather for higher black hole mass @xmath186 and accretion rate @xmath187 , since with those assumptions hot skin does not cover disk completely .",
    "this conclusion is opposite to the black hole mass estimations done for ton s180 by wang & lu ( 2001 ) , where @xmath188 .",
    "but our result is consistent with studies done by siemiginowska ( 1997 ) , where simple disk corona model was fitted to the _ beppo sax _ data ( those presented by comastri et al .",
    "we argue , contrary to the previous papers by turner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and vaughan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) that spectral features in absorption and even in emission are present in the _ chandra _ data of ton s180 .",
