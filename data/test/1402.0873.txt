    "the field of ultracold atomic gases has progressed rapidly over the last decades .",
    "this progress was driven by the ability to continuously discover and control new features of these systems  @xcite .",
    "optical lattices were used to create reduced dimensions , as well as lattice systems in the strongly interacting limit  @xcite ; mixtures of several internal states of ultracold atoms were used to create effective pseudo - spin systems  @xcite ; the unitary regime of ultracold fermions was explored via the control of bound molecular states via feshbach resonances  @xcite , to name just a few .    in the recent past , atoms and molecules with large electric and magnetic dipole moments were cooled into or near quantum degeneracy  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the long - range and anisotropic character of the dipole - dipole interaction was demonstrated , which goes beyond the properties of contact potentials , as discussed in refs .",
    "theoretical predictions have been made in refs .",
    "@xcite , that include the formation of supersolids  @xcite , quantum liquid crystals  @xcite , and bond - order solids  @xcite in dipolar gases .",
    "furthermore , many - body phases in 1d geometries have been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .    , that points in the direction defined by the angles @xmath1 and @xmath2 as depicted in ( a ) .",
    "we propose to measure the mean - field shift of a mott state in a 2d optical lattice , shown in ( b ) , as a function of the angles @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for comparison",
    ", we also consider a quasi-2d system of width @xmath3 of fermions in continuum , panel ( c ) , for which we determine the mean field shift as a function of @xmath4 . ]    here we investigate quadrupole - quadrupole interactions as a novel feature of ultracold atom systems . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , for alkaline - earth atoms such as yb and sr in any @xmath5 state of the @xmath6 manifold , prepared in an optical lattice with a lattice constant of a few hundreds of nanometers , these interactions are , while small , of realistic magnitude to be relevant in current experiments .",
    "the quantum phases of quadrupolar quantum gases have been discussed in refs .",

    ", we provide a detailed theoretical study exploring the feasibility of detecting quadrupole - quadrupole interaction in a realistic experiment .",
    "in particular , we propose to detect the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction between ultracold atoms via ultra - high precision spectroscopy of the induced mean - field shift .",
    "we consider a mott insulator state in a 2d optical square lattice and under strong confinement in the third direction . for comparison",
    ", we study a quasi-2d fermi gas of spin - polarized atoms in continuum .",

    "the atoms are prepared in a state with a particular projection , @xmath5 , of the angular momentum , @xmath8 , along the quantization axis .",
    "the quantization axis is given by the field @xmath7 , which points in the direction defined by the polar angles @xmath9 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry](a ) . in the case of the 2d system in continuum ,",
    "[ fig : geometry](c ) , the angle @xmath2 is irrelevant , due to the cylindrical symmetry . as the main example we consider yb and sr in a single @xmath5 state of the @xmath6 manifold , where @xmath10 gives the projection of the total angular momentum @xmath11 onto the quantization axis .",
    "the angular dependence of the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction potential is the characteristic feature of this interaction .",
    "we therefore propose to measure the mean - field frequency shift per particle as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "below , we calculate this mean - field shift for both systems , and we find a characteristic angular dependence , as shown in figs . [",
    "fig : deltaall](a ) and [ fig : continuum ] .",
    "we observe that the interaction changes from repulsive to attractive and back within the range of @xmath12 .",
    "this characteristic angular dependence constitutes the smoking gun feature to be found experimentally .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the shift of tens of hertz for yb(@xmath6 ) and similarly for sr(@xmath6 ) makes this experimentally conceivable with current technology .",
    "this energy shift has to be measured with respect to a reference state .",
    "we propose to use the ground state , @xmath13 , which has no quadrupole moment and for which the optical transition can be probed  @xcite . since we want to verify the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction , only present in the @xmath14 manifold , the initial state for this spectroscopic measurement needs to be the @xmath14 state .",
    "for this , we propose to first transfer the quantum degenerated atoms to the meta - stable @xmath14 state with a short clock - laser pulse . subsequently a high - resolution spectroscopy is performed by coherently deexciting atoms to the ground state for various angles @xmath1 of the magnetic field .",
    "the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction can be demonstrated with this characteristic angular dependence .",
    "a second approach we propose is radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy between different @xmath5 states of the @xmath14 manifold , split by the zeeman effect , which exhibits different quadrupole moments proportional to @xmath15 , see ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath16 , this gives a ratio between the quadrupole moment @xmath17 of the @xmath18 states , and of the @xmath19 states , @xmath20 , of @xmath21 .",
