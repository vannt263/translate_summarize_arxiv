    "rotational brownian motion of colloidal particles is a classical subject in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "contrary to its translational cousin , _",
    "i.e. _ `` usual '' brownian motion , it does not result in changes of the particle location and is hence not as easily demonstrated in experiments .",
    "if , however , the suspended particles carry an electric or magnetic moment their orientation couples to external fields and the electric or magnetic relaxation properties of the suspension are direct consequences of the rotational diffusion of the constituting particles . in particular , in the well developed theory of ferrofluids the importance of rotational brownian motion for the theoretical description of the often complex and surprising hydrodynamic and magnetic properties was recognized already a long time ago @xcite .",
    "ferrofluids are suspensions of nano - size ferromagnetic grains in carrier liquids like water or oil .",
    "they combine the hydrodynamic properties of newtonian fluids with the magnetic behaviour of superparamagnets @xcite . due to the viscosity of the carrier liquid",
    "there is a coupling between the rotation of the magnetic grains and the local vorticity of the hydrodynamic flow .",
    "this coupling can , _ e.g. _ , be used to spin up ferromagnetic drops floating in a non - magnetic fluid of the same density with the help of a _ rotating magnetic field _ @xcite .",
    "complementary , a rotational ferrofluid flow exposed to a static magnetic field exhibits an enhanced shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "various related effects such as `` negative '' rotational viscosity @xcite , magneto - vortical resonance @xcite , and anomalously enhanced ac - response due to coherent particle rotation @xcite have been investigated .",
    "they rely on the exchange of angular momentum between rotating particles and an oscillating magnetic field . in these cases ,",
    "the imposed non - zero _ flow vorticity _ of the ferrofluid is crucial for breaking the symmetry between clockwise and counter - clockwise particle rotation .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a much more indirect and subtle aspect of the interplay between rotational brownian motion of ferrofluid particles and their relaxation dynamics in an external magnetic field .",
    "we will show that a suitably designed time dependent external magnetic field _ without net rotating component _ may rectify the fluctuations of the particle orientation and set up a _ noise - induced _ rotation of the ferromagnetic grains .",
    "we will hence investigate how angular momentum can be transferred from an _ oscillating _ magnetic field to a ferrofluid _ at rest_. the effect was predicted theoretically and demonstrated experimentally in a previous short communication @xcite . in the present paper we provide much more details on the theoretical description and add several new results .",
    "the extraction of directed motion from random fluctuations is an old and controversial problem in statistical mechanics with a long and interesting history @xcite .",
    "although excluded by the second law of thermodynamics for equilibrium systems , rectification of fluctuations _ is _ possible in systems driven sufficiently far away from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the problem has gained renewed attention under the trademarks of `` thermal ratchets '' and `` brownian motors '' due to its possible relevance for biological transport @xcite and the prospects of nano - technology @xcite .",
    "ferrofluids are ideal systems to investigate such fluctuation driven transport phenomena and also to demonstrate them experimentally @xcite : as already discussed above , the rotational dynamics of the ferromagnetic grains is strongly influenced by thermal fluctuations .",
    "appropriate time - dependent potentials can be easily designed with the help of external magnetic fields . finally , directed rotational transport in ferrofluids should manifest itself as systematic rotation of the ferromagnetic nano - particles .",
    "this in turn can be easily detected from the resulting _ macroscopic _ torque on the carrier liquid .",
    "various somewhat related but still quite different phenomena in rotational dynamical systems are treated in @xcite .    throughout the paper",
    "we will use two basic approximations which simplify the analysis considerably and which are rather common for ferrofluids @xcite .",
    "the first is to neglect neel - relaxation of the magnetization , _",
    "i.e. _ the rotation of the magnetization vector with respect to the ferromagnetic particle .",
    "this is justified for particle sizes that are not too small and amounts to assuming that the magnetic moments are firmly attached to the geometry of the particles .",
    "any reorientation of the magnetic moment hence requires a rotation of the particle as a whole .",
    "the second approximation is to neglect dipole - dipole interactions between the particles .",
    "although these interactions may be important in concentrated ferrofluids , they are negligible in sufficiently diluted ones .",
    "the ratchet mechanism of central interest in the present investigation can operate without any particle - particle interaction .",
    "we will hence assume that our ferrofluids are sufficiently diluted and use a _ single particle _ model .",
    "for a more quantitative assessment of the role of the dipole - dipole interactions see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the general framework for describing the rotational brownian motion of a single suspended ferromagnetic particle in an external magnetic field .",
    "section [ sec : symm ] gives a detailed account of the symmetries characteristic of our system and discusses how these symmetries influence the possibility for a ratchet mechanism to operate . in section [ sec : fpe ] the central fokker - planck equation describing our system is analyzed . besides an investigation of the weak noise limit",
    "we describe the numerical solution of the fokker - planck equation and compare the results with two different approximate treatments yielding analytical expressions for the transferred angular momentum .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conc ] contains some conclusions .",
    "we consider the rotational motion of a spherical particle of volume @xmath0 and magnetic moment @xmath1 immersed in a liquid with dynamic viscosity @xmath2 and subject to a horizontal , time dependent , spatially homogeneous magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "the field is composed of a constant part @xmath4 parallel to the @xmath5-axis and an oscillatory part @xmath6 with period @xmath7 along the @xmath8-direction @xmath9 different choices for the time dependence of @xmath10 are of interest . in the present paper",
    "we will mainly discuss two cases which are each representative for a whole class .",
    "our first standard choice is @xmath11 where the amplitudes @xmath12 , and the phase @xmath13 are control parameters .",
    "the main features of this time dependence are a zero average over one period and the presence of a higher harmonic of the basic frequency . as a second example",
    ", we will also discuss the form @xmath14 for which the average over one period is different from zero .",
    "it arises naturally if the constant field component is not perpendicular to the time dependent one . in any case , the magnetic field is of a pure oscillatory character , _",
    "i.e. _ it _ does not contain a net rotating component_.    the orientation of the particle at time @xmath15 is described by the unit vector @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the modulus of the magnetic moment .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the instantaneous angular velocity of the particle .",
    "changes of @xmath21 are due to torques on the particle .",
    "denoting by @xmath22 the angular part of the three dimensional nabla operator , the magnetic torque @xmath23 derives from the potential energy @xmath24 of a magnetic dipole in an external field @xcite .",
    "further , the viscosity @xmath2 of the carrier liquid gives rise to a viscous torque @xcite @xmath25 additionally , the interaction between the rotating particle and the surrounding liquid also causes thermal fluctuations which generate a stochastic torque @xcite @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is a vector of independent , @xmath13-correlated gaussian noise sources of zero mean , the noise intensity is related to the temperature @xmath28 and the dissipation ( [ defvisctor ] ) of the carrier liquid by the fluctuation - dissipation relation , and @xmath29 stands for boltzmann s constant . denoting the moment of inertia of the particle by @xmath30 , the equation of motion for @xmath21 acquires the form @xmath31 eqs.([evol1 ] ) and ( [ evol2 ] ) form a closed set of equations for the description of the rotational motion of the particle . using experimentally relevant parameter values ( density of the particle @xmath32 kg / m@xmath33 , particle radius @xmath34",
    "nm , viscosity @xmath35 pas , time scale @xmath36 s ) we find that the first term on the l.h.s .",
    "( [ evol2 ] ) is five to seven orders of magnitude smaller than the second one .",
    "we may hence safely neglect inertial effects @xcite and find for @xmath21 in the overdamped limit @xmath37 where we have introduced @xmath38 .",
    "using this result in ( [ evol1 ] ) yields a closed equation for the time evolution of @xmath18 @xmath39 it is convenient to introduce dimensionless units . to this end",
    "we measure time in units of the inverse of the external driving frequency , @xmath40 , use @xmath41 as unit for the magnetic field strength , @xmath42 , and rescale the noise intensity according to @xmath43 . the evolution equation for the orientation",
    "@xmath18 then reads @xmath44 introducing the brownian relaxation time @xmath45 we note that the rescaled , dimensionless noise intensity @xmath46 occurring in ( [ evol4 ] ) just gives the ratio between the relevant deterministic and stochastic time scales in the system : @xmath47    to proceed , we parametrize the orientation @xmath18 of the magnetic particle by two angles @xmath48 and @xmath49 according to @xmath50 from ( [ evol4 ] ) we then find the following langevin equations for the time evolution of these angles @xcite @xmath51 in the dimensionless units adopted , the noise intensity @xmath46 is given by ( [ defd ] ) and the potential ( [ defu ] ) takes the form @xmath52 the thermal fluctuations @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given by two independent , @xmath13-correlated gaussian noise sources of zero mean .",
    "note that in ( [ lan2 ] ) we are dealing with multiplicative white noise but since the multiplicative function is independent of @xmath55 , no ambiguity ( ito- vs. stratonovich - interpretation @xcite ) arises .",
    "it is instructive also to consider the simplified situation of a one - dimensional dynamics in which the vector @xmath18 is assumed to be constrained to the horizontal @xmath5-@xmath8-plane .",
    "accordingly , ( [ lan1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath56 and ( [ lan2 ] ) simplifies to @xmath57 where @xmath58    the observable of foremost interest in the present investigation is the time and ensemble averaged torque ( [ defmagtor ] ) exerted by the magnetic field upon the magnetic particle in the long time limit , _",
    "i.e. _ after initial transient have died out .",
    "since the magnetic field ( [ deffield ] ) is constrained to the @xmath5-@xmath8 plane , only the @xmath59-component of this magnetic torque can be different from zero . suppressing the subscript @xmath60 in ( [ defmagtor ] ) from now on",
    ", we denote the averaged @xmath59-component of the magnetic torque by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 stands for the ensemble average over the different realizations of the noise terms in ( [ lan1 ] ) , ( [ lan2 ] ) and the overbar represents the time average over one period of the magnetic field . using ( [ deffield ] ) and ( [ defmagtor ] ) we get @xmath63 exploiting ( [ defpot ] ) and ( [ lan2 ] )",
    "one readily finds the equivalent expressions @xmath64 for reasons of ergodicity , the ensemble average in ( [ torav ] ) is equivalent to a time average of a single realization over an infinite time interval .",
    "then the extra time average over one period of the external driving drops out and we are left with @xmath65 and similarly for the equivalent expressions in ( [ torav ] ) , ( [ torav ] ) .",
    "space - time plot of the potential @xmath66 from eq.([defpot ] ) for the time dependence ( [ foft1 ] ) with @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "dark and bright regions correspond to small and large values of @xmath69 , respectively . in the long - time limit ,",
    "the deterministic dynamics ( [ lan1 ] ) , ( [ lan2 ] ) with @xmath70 approaches @xmath71 and a periodical @xmath55 , oscillating back and forth as represented by either of the full black lines . in the presence of a small amount of noise ,",
    "occasional transitions across the unstable deterministic orbits shown as full white lines become possible which are schematically indicated by the dashed lines . the spatial asymmetry and temporal anharmonicity of",
    "the potential conspire to yield slightly different rates for noise induced increments and decrements of @xmath49 , respectively . as a result a noise driven rotation of the particles arises . for a detailed discussion see section [ inst1d ] . ]    in the absence of thermal fluctuations , the particle orientation is governed by the overdamped deterministic relaxation dynamics given by ( [ lan1 ] ) , ( [ lan2 ] ) with @xmath70 .",
    "hence , at any given moment , the orientation @xmath72 tends to align with the instantaneous magnetic field @xmath73 which lies in the @xmath5-@xmath8-plane .",
    "one can then show @xcite that @xmath74 converges to @xmath75 for @xmath76 and that @xmath55 approaches a _ periodic _ long time behaviour .",
    "this implies via ( [ torav  ] ) that @xmath77 _",
    "i.e. _ , in the absence of thermal fluctuations no particle rotation will occur and no average torque can arise .",
    "an explicit example is displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this scenario changes fundamentally in the presence of fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath78 . as shown qualitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , for small noise intensities , the time dependence of @xmath55 and @xmath74 will still closely follow the deterministic trajectories , except that now also rare , fluctuation induced _ transitions _ between different deterministic solutions may occur . if the rates of forward ( increasing @xmath49 by @xmath79 ) and backward transitions ( decreasing @xmath49 by @xmath79 ) are different from each other , then on the average a net rotation of the particle will occur , implying with ( [ eq24 ] ) that @xmath80 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the so - called ratchet effect @xcite in which an unbiased potential and undirected brownian fluctuations cooperate to produce directed transport .",
    "the detailed operation of the ratchet mechanism for the rotational motion of a colloidal particle is the main focus of the present paper .",
    "symmetry considerations admit conclusions from the equations of motion without actually solving them . for",
    "the investigation of ratchet systems , studies of symmetry turned out to be valuable since directed transport generically occurs if it is not forbidden by symmetries , a statement referred to as curie s principle @xcite . here",
    "we specifically address the question which transformations of the magnetic field components @xmath4 and @xmath6 in ( [ deffield ] ) leave the average @xmath59-component of the torque invariant , @xmath81 , and which lead to its inversion , @xmath82 .    from eq .",
    "( [ torav  ] ) one readily concludes that the following transformations of @xmath49 and @xmath48 imply the indicated transformation behavior of @xmath61 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are arbitrary . observing that the values of both the original and the transformed @xmath74 are restricted to the interval @xmath86 $ ] and that the entire interval will indeed be sampled by some realization of the dynamics ( [ lan1 ] ) , ( [ lan2 ] )",
    ", it follows that no transformations of the form @xmath87 with @xmath88 or @xmath89 with @xmath90 are possible .",
    "finally , in order to conclude @xmath82 in ( [ 1e ] ) one has to exploit that in ( [ torav  ] ) the limit @xmath91 is not necessarily tantamount to @xmath92 with @xmath93 kept fixed , but can also be realized by letting @xmath94 with @xmath95 kept fixed .",
    "closer inspection of ( [ torav  ] ) reveals that any further symmetry transformation that leaves @xmath61 invariant or changes its sign can be composed of the `` elementary '' transformations ( [ 1a])-([1e ] ) .",
    "next we ask ourselves what equations of motion govern the transformed @xmath96 , @xmath55 defined by ( [ 1a])-([1e ] ) . in the simplest case ( [ 1a ] )",
    "one readily concludes from ( [ lan1 ] ) and ( [ lan2 ] ) that the transformed @xmath96 , @xmath55 satisfy the same equations of motion ( [ lan1 ] ) and ( [ lan2 ] ) but with a transformed potential @xmath97 with arbitrary @xmath98 .",
    "turning to the second transformation ( [ 1b ] ) one finds similarly that the transformed @xmath96 and @xmath55 satisfy the equations of motion ( [ lan1 ] ) and ( [ lan2 ] ) but now with a transformed potential @xmath99 and in addition with a transformed noise @xmath100 . since the statistical properties of the two noises @xmath101 and @xmath54 are equal , _",
    "i.e. _ they are identical stochastic processes , the same follows for the corresponding processes given by ( [ lan1 ] ) and ( [ lan2 ] ) . in other words , to each realization of the original @xmath96 , @xmath55 corresponds a realization of the transformed @xmath96 , @xmath55 occurring with the same probability , and vice versa .",
    "since the average torque in ( [ torav  ] ) is independent of the specific realization @xmath96 , @xmath55 with probability 1 ( _ i.e. _ up to a set of realizations of measure zero ) we can conclude that in this case @xmath82 .",
    "similar considerations can be done for the cases given by ( [ 1c ] ) and ( [ 1d ] ) . the last transformation ( [ 1e ] ) is insofar special as a mapping between the dynamics of the original and the transformed variables is possible only , if the term @xmath102 in ( [ lan1 ] ) identically vanishes , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath103 .",
    "we therefore find the following implications of transformations in the potential @xmath104 : @xmath105 where @xmath98 is an arbitrary constant .    finally , we have to determine all those transformations of the magnetic field components @xmath4 and @xmath6 in ( [ deffield ] ) which correspond via ( [ defpot ] ) to transformations of the potential @xmath106 given in ( [ 2a])-([2e ] ) .",
    "since changes in @xmath4 and @xmath6 always imply changes in the potential @xmath69 that depend on @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we can only induce transformations with @xmath107 .",
    "the only non - trivial way to realize ( [ 2a ] ) is @xmath108 combined with @xmath109 with an arbitrary integer @xmath110 .",
    "similarly , ( [ 2b ] ) and ( [ 2d ] ) are equivalent to @xmath111 and @xmath112 . on the other hand ( [ 2c ] ) only admits the trivial realization @xmath113 .",
    "finally , ( [ 2e ] ) can be implemented by @xmath114 . in summary , we find that @xmath115 where the trivial result ( [ 3c ] ) is listed only for the sake of completeness .    while ( [ 3a])-([3d ] ) are intuitively more or less obvious , ( [ 3e ] ) respectively ( [ 2e ] ) is not .",
    "the additional condition @xmath116 shows that the constrained dynamics ( [ lan3 ] ) , ( [ deff ] ) has an extra symmetry which is lost if the full two - dimensional dynamics ( [ lan1 ] ) , ( [ lan2 ] ) is considered .",
    "we note that ( [ 3a])-([3e ] ) could also have been obtained in a more direct way .",
    "our somewhat more involved line of reasoning has the advantage that we can exclude that there are any transformations other than ( [ 3a])-([3e ] ) and combinations thereof which would leave @xmath61 invariant or change its sign .    in order to see that the above considerations already allow some non - trivial conclusions about the possibility of angular momentum transfer from the oscillating magnetic field to the particle we combine ( [ 3a ] ) and ( [ 3b ] ) , ( [ 3b ] ) and ( [ 3d ] ) , and ( [ 3a ] ) and ( [ 3e ] ) to obtain @xmath117 respectively .",
    "from ( [ 3f ] ) we immediately can infer that the constant field in @xmath5-direction is indispensable for a non - zero average torque , @xmath118 similarly ( [ 3 g ] ) implies that for a time dependence obeying @xmath119 for some @xmath85 the average torque has to vanish as well @xmath120 choosing in particular @xmath121 , _ i.e. _ half the period of the external driving , we realize that an oscillating field @xmath6 with a fourier expansion containing only odd multiples of the basic frequency @xmath122 will result in a zero average torque @xmath61 , irrespective of the particular choices of the amplitudes @xmath123 and phases @xmath124 .",
    "eqs.([4a ] ) and ( [ 4c ] ) motivate our choices ( [ foft1 ] ) and ( [ foft2 ] ) as simple time dependencies of the oscillating field resulting in a non - zero average torque @xmath61 .    for the special time dependence ( [ foft1 ] ) we find from ( [ 3 g ] ) @xmath125 as a consequence , upon continuously varying @xmath13 we can infer that there must exist a @xmath126 such that @xmath127 for @xmath128 or @xmath129 .",
    "it is important to note that this case of zero averaged torque is qualitatively different from the situations described by eqs .",
    "( [ 4a ] ) and ( [ 4b ] ) since it is due to the _ fine tuning of a parameter _ rather than resulting from an underlying symmetry .",
    "consequently , upon variation of @xmath13 around @xmath130 the average torque @xmath61 changes sign , which is a realization of a so - called _ current inversion _ @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by fixing @xmath128 , a sign change of @xmath61 will generically also occur upon variation of any other parameter of the system .",
    "interesting examples for such a parameter include the driving frequency @xmath131 , the noise intensity @xmath46 , and the particle volume @xmath0 . in the latter case",
    "we hence face the intriguing possibility that in a polydisperse ferrofluid under the same experimental conditions the larger and smaller particles will rotate in _ opposite _ directions .",
    "we finally note that in the case where the dynamics is constrained to the @xmath5-@xmath8-axis , the additional symmetry ( [ 3h ] ) implies that @xmath132 .",
    "consequently the @xmath13-values where the torque changes sign are fixed by the additional symmetry and do not depend on the other parameters of the problem .",
    "hence no current reversal upon changes in these parameters is possible .",
    "this is the main difference between the full two - dimensional dynamics ( [ lan1 ] ) , ( [ lan2 ] ) and its simplified one - dimensional counterpart ( [ lan3 ] ) , see also @xcite .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the overdamped brownian rotation of a single ferrofluid particle in a time dependent external field can be built on the numerical simulation of the langevin equations ( [ lan1 ] ) , ( [ lan2 ] ) .",
    "such simulations unambiguously show the occurrence of noise induced rotation of the particle in an oscillating field @xcite . for a detailed study of the influence of the various parameters of the problem on the transferred torque @xmath61 it is , however , more convenient to start with the equivalent fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the probability density @xmath133 for the orientation ( [ defe ] ) of the particle @xmath134 here",

    "we are hence able to determine the precise form of the ( dominating ) stochastic transitions by solving a variational problem .    under rather general conditions which are satisfied in our particular setting one can show that the transition rate between two stable orbits of the dynamics is determined by the probability to reach from the starting stable orbit the unstable orbit separating the two stable ones @xcite . the subsequent relaxation to the final stable orbit is then purely deterministic and does not contribute to the transition probability @xmath144 in the weak - noise limit .",

    "the results from the fokker - planck equation are completely consistent with rather general symmetry considerations detailed in section [ sec : symm ] . moreover , they agree very well with simulations of the corresponding langevin equations as given in @xcite and quantitatively describe the experimental findings reported in @xcite .",
    "we remark that our present system puts forward a new type of thermal ratchet device which does not fit into any previously known specific class of ratchet systems . adopting the classification scheme from @xcite ,",
    "our present system has some similarity with so - called asymmetrically tilting ratchets as well as with a so - called traveling potential ratchets , however in the generalized sense involving two counterpropagating traveling potentials .",
    "yet there remain significant differences with both these classes . in particular , we note that we are not dealing here with a periodic , asymmetric so - called `` ratchet''-potential .",
    "rather , at any fixed instance of time the relevant potential is perfectly symmetric about the instantaneous direction of the magnetic field and hence no preferential direction of rotation seems to exists .",
    "it is only via the time evolution that a symmetry breaking arise , which is sometimes called a dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "in summary we hope that the present investigation has demonstrated that ferrofluids are very suitable systems to study various aspects of thermal ratchet behaviour , and that it may stimulate further theoretical , numerical and experimental work in this direction .",
    "special thanks is due to ubbo felderhoff for several interesting suggestions and to martin raible for providing the numerical simulation results in fig .",
