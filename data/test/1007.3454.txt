    "top - physics is at the heart of the tevatron and lhc physics programme . since its first observation at the tevatron in 1995 @xcite at lot of effort went into measuring top - quark production cross sections , its mass and quantum numbers . at the lhc top - quark physics",
    "can offer a unique window into potential new physics at the tev scale , see for instance @xcite .    when considering the semi - leptonic decay of a produced pair of top - quarks the resulting final state is @xmath0jets ( where up to two jets might be heavy - flavor tagged ) .",
    "the very same signature is provided by a leptonically decaying @xmath1 associated by a corresponding number of qcd jets . to highlight the importance of the @xmath2jets processes as the dominating background to top - pair production ,",
    "the lhc production cross sections for @xmath3jets and @xmath4jets are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt_wjets_xsecs ] .    here only a generic set of cuts , namely @xmath5 gev , @xmath6 gev , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , on the final - state leptons and jets ( including those from the top decays ) has been applied . from the left panel",
    "we can infer that the probability of producing a @xmath9 pair in association with one or more extra jets is quite significant , an observation that is confirmed by the corresponding one - loop calculations @xcite .",
    "these production rates have to be confronted with the @xmath10-jets cross sections , displayed in the right panel .",
    "while the inclusive @xmath1 rate exceeds the @xmath9 cross section by orders of magnitude , when asking for @xmath11 jets the rates become of same size . however , even for @xmath12-jets , background to the semi - leptonic @xmath13-jets process , at leading order ( lo ) background exceeds the signal .    from these simple considerations it is evident that there is a strong demand for having predictions for the @xmath10-jets processes accurate at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd , reducing inherent scale uncertainties of the theoretical predictions .",
    "furthermore an accurate modelling of this class of high jet - multiplicity processes in monte carlo event generators is of major importance for the success of the ambitious lhc top - physics menu .",
    "until recently nlo predictions have been available only for final states involving a @xmath1 boson and up to two additional jets @xcite .",
    "significant progress in the evaluation of virtual matrix elements involving many external legs has enabled two independent groups to eventually calculate @xmath14jets at one - loop accuracy .    in refs .",

    "@xcite proposed a prescription called `` leading color adjustment '' that allows them to provide a sensible approximation to the full - color nlo result .",
    "in essence they rescale the leading color one - loop result by a constant factor defined to be the ratio of the lo full color cross section over its leading - color approximation .    in refs .",
    "@xcite the first complete nlo calculation of @xmath14jets has been presented .",
    "this calculation includes all partonic subprocesses and is exact in the treatment of color .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "concerning backgrounds to top - quark production special attention has to be given to @xmath4jets final states with one or two jets being b - tagged .",
    "using massive partons in the theoretical calculation removes corresponding soft and collinear singularities as they are regulated by the finite quark mass , however at the price of the fixed - order calculation being more difficult . at present the nlo corrections for @xmath28 , with massive @xmath29-quarks , are known @xcite . when applying cuts that suppress contributions from the threshold region @xmath30 the actual difference between the fully massive calculation and the limit @xmath31 is typically less than 10% @xcite .",

    "figure taken from @xcite , further details can be found therein .",
    "[ fig : mbb_lo ] ]    however , when sensitive to the threshold region or in case that just one heavy quark is tagged the massless approximation is not applicable . in the latter case",
    "the unobserved heavy jet must be integrated over the whole phase space thus introducing reference to the b - quark mass , cf .",
    "[ fig : mbb_lo ] .",
    "one way out is to use heavy - quark parton distribution functions  the so - called variable flavor scheme ( vfs ) that has the additional advantage to re - sum large logarithms of the type @xmath33 to all orders .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a full nlo calculation of producing a @xmath1 boson in association with just a single b - jet has been presented .",
    "this calculation consistently combines the massive @xmath28 calculation of @xcite with the vfs computation of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this calculation is an important ingredient when comparing the recent cdf measurement of the @xmath1 associated @xmath29-jet cross section @xcite with the nlo qcd calculation @xmath35 there is obviously tension between experiment and the theoretical results from nlo qcd as well as monte carlo predictions relying on matrix - element parton - shower merging @xcite .",
    "the source of this disagreement is still under study - but might be assigned to the scale choice in the calculations @xcite .",
    "in cases we lack a full nlo calculation ( e.g. @xmath36jets ) or observables are sensitive to multiple - parton emission and hadronization effects , theoretical predictions rely on the ability of multi - purpose monte carlo generators such as pythia @xcite , herwig @xcite or sherpa @xcite to account for the underlying physics . over the past",
    "decade enormous efforts went into improving these calculations by consistently incorporating multi - leg tree - level matrix elements into parton - shower simulations in the spirit of @xcite . for an overview of available approaches and an extensive comparison for @xmath4jets production at tevatron and lhc",
    "essentially two major problems have to be addressed by each tree - level merging algorithm :    * how to attach a parton shower to a multi - leg tree - level matrix - element calculation without spoiling the logarithmic accuracy of the underlying qcd resummation ? * how to avoid potential double- or under counting of phase - space configurations present in the parton shower and corresponding matrix - element calculations ?",
    "to accommodate these conditions in a generic tree - level merging algorithm    * multi - parton matrix elements get regularized through a suitably defined jet measure ( e.g. a critical @xmath25- or cone - like distance ) ; * appropriate starting conditions for the initial- and final - state parton shower have to be determined and certain ( hard ) shower emissions need to be vetoed .",
    "in particular the second item is subject to certain approximations in the various schemes .",
    "an important concept to overcome those approximations is a so - called _ truncated shower _ , first proposed in ref .",
    "the underlying observation is that due to a mismatch of the jet - measure , used to slice the emission phase space , and the actual shower - evolution variable the radiation pattern of soft / large - angle emissions can be distorted .    in ref .",
    "@xcite such a truncated shower was implemented for the first time .",
    "the implementation relies on the shower algorithm based on catani ",
    "seymour dipole factorization @xcite and combines it with the matrix - element generators available inside the sherpa framework .",
    "the method has successfully been applied to jet production in @xmath37 collisions , the drell - yan process @xcite , prompt - photon production @xcite and deep - inelastic scattering @xcite . as of version 1.2",
    "it constitutes the default method for combining matrix elements with parton showers in the sherpa generator .",
    "the new merging approach yields a largely reduced dependence on the intrinsic merging parameters compared to the previous ckkw implementation in sherpa and other merging algorithms @xcite .",
