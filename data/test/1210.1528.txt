    "in quantum gravity research , we strive to answer the question `` what is spacetime like on very small scales ? '' .",
    "more precisely , this can be rephrased as `` what is the microscopic dynamics of gravity ? '' , `` what are the fundamental symmetries ? '' , `` is spacetime continuous or somehow discrete ? '' , `` what is the dimensionality of spacetime on small scales ? '' . to answer these",
    ", each approach to quantum gravity is founded upon assumptions . ultimately , these should be tested in experiments . here ,",
    "matter - quantum gravity interactions provide us with two possibilities :    \\1 ) consistency tests ( indirect ) : here we can check , whether a particular uv completion for gravity is compatible with the observed properties of the standard model of particle physics , such as the number of fermions , scalars and gauge bosons , the global symmetries , the observed mass scales , etc .",
    "\\2 ) direct tests : effects such as graviton - exchange in scattering processes , can be used to study the small - scale structure of spacetime .",
    "in particular , the dimensionality of spacetime on small scales can be tested at near - future experiments .    for examples of the first option , where the consistency of asymptotically safe quantum gravity , as well as other models for quantum gravity , with the existence of light fermions in our universe is tested ,",
    "see @xcite . within the truncation of the full renormalization group ( rg ) flow employed in this work ,",
    "asymptotic safety is compatible with fermion masses much below the planck mass , whereas restrictions are placed on the parameter space for other quantum gravity models .",
    "high - intensity lasers are subject to quickly advancing experimental research , and have the potential to provide future particle accelerators that could replace conventional accelerators and reach higher energies over much shorter acceleration paths , albeit reaching high luminosities remains a challenge .",
    "once high - energy electrons are available , either from high - intensity lasers or conventional linear accelerators , the energy can be transferred to photons by compton - backscattering , thus enabling high - energy photon - photon scattering .",
    "this provides for a possible window into the quantum - gravity regime @xcite : since there is no microscopic photon - photon interaction in the standard model , the cross - section is dominated solely by loop effects . due to the tree - level graviton - exchange in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 channels ,",
    "the quantum gravity effect is easier to access here than in processes which have a large standard model background , such as , e.g. , processes at the lhc , see , e.g. @xcite .    here",
    ", we will focus on asymptotic safety as a uv completion for gravity , i.e. a quantum field theory of the metric , which is extendible up to arbitrarily high energies due to the existence of an interacting fixed point of the rg .",
    "see , e.g. @xcite for reviews . in order to detect experimental signatures of asymptotic safety",
    ", we have to include the effect of a momentum - scale dependent newton coupling , which encodes the leading - order non - perturbative physics underlying the asymptotic - safety scenario . the dimensionful newton coupling @xmath3 on a large range of scales .",
    "this behavior characterizes the classical regime of the theory , required for the consistency with experiment , and has been shown to exist in truncated rg flow studies @xcite .",
    "the second property is special in the asymptotic - safety scenario : a uv completion with the help of an interacting fixed point requires that @xmath4 for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dimensionless newton coupling and @xmath7 the rg scale .",
    "thus we model the scale - dependence in @xmath8 spacetime dimensions in the following way : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the constant dimensionful value for the newton coupling measured in the infrared . here",
    "the transition scale @xmath11 , assumed to lie close to the planck scale , is presently unknown , and signals the onset of the fixed - point behavior .",
    "we study scenarios with @xmath12 flat extra dimensions @xcite with compactification radius @xmath13 , where the fundamental planck scale @xmath14 .",
    "a kaluza - klein tower of graviton states contributes to the cross section , and has to be summed at the amplitude level . as for settings with @xmath15 ,",
    "the spacing between kaluza - klein modes is small , the sum can be well approximated by an integral .",
    "this is uv divergent for @xmath16 when @xmath17 , see @xcite .",
    "this differs in asymptotic safety , where we employ the scale - identification @xmath18 , i.e. , the fixed - point regime is probed by the heavy kaluza - klein modes , whereas the low - lying modes probe the classical gravity regime .",
    "then , using @xmath19 yields a finite integral : @xmath20 .",
    "[ gg_sm_as_n ] shows our main results @xcite : at photon energies of @xmath21 , the standard - model cross section is measurable at @xmath22 and the graviton - induced cross section in our approximation is of the same size , thus being easily detectable .",
    "this holds for a fundamental planck scale @xmath23 and for 2 , 3 and possibly even 4 extra dimensions .",
    "the result for asymptotic safety clearly differs from the result in the cutoff - theory , due to the extra contribution arising from the fixed - point regime .",
    "this allows to experimentally distinguish asymptotic safety from other uv completions .",
    "we plot the cross section ( @xmath24 ) for the standard model ( black continuous line ) , for the cutoff theory ( thin lines ) with @xmath25 and for asymptotic safety ( thick lines ) with @xmath26 .",
    "we show @xmath27 ( red dashed ) , @xmath28 ( blue dotted ) and @xmath29 ( green dot - dashed ) . ]",
    "employing sources of high - energy photons , such as an electron collider or laser plasma wake - field acceleration , where photons reach high energies by compton backscattering off high - energy electrons , allows to test the dimensionality of spacetime and detect possible quantum gravity effects in a very clean setting .",
    "photon energies of 1 tev suffice to access a fundamental planck scale @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the imprints of asymptotically safe quantum gravity can then be clearly distinguished from other quantum gravity models .",
    "thus , near - future experiments can start to shed light on the small - scale structure of spacetime .",
