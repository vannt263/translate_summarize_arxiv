    "the underlying idea behind the above screw - pitch optimization ( [ adjusted_v ] ) is as follows . in general , the excitation gap is proportional to reciprocal correlation length @xmath53 . on the one hand , according to the scaling hypothesis , namely , at the critical point , the correlation length develops up to the linear dimension of the cluster @xmath54 ; in other words , the correlation length is bounded by the system size , and it should extend fully for the equilateral cluster . hence ,",
