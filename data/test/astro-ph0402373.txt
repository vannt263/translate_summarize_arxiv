    "in the early phases of star formation , the forming accretion disks are likely to be very massive because of a strong infall from the parent molecular cloud .",
    "these massive disks are subject to the development of gravitational instabilities which transport angular momentum outward ( laughlin , korchagin , & adams 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , when sufficiently ionized , the disks are also unstable to the mri ( balbus & hawley 1991 , 1998 ) .",
    "the simultaneous development of these instabilities in disks may significantly affect their evolution .",
    "we have undertaken a study of self - gravitating magnetized tori by means of numerical simulations .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the numerical methods we have used . in section 3 , we present the results of the 2d simulations , focusing on the properties of the mri in a self - gravitating environment",
    ". in section 4 , we review preliminary results obtained in 3d calculations , and we discuss the implications of our results in section 5 .",
    "we used the code zeus-2d ( stone & norman 1992a , 1992b ) to perform the 2d calculations and the code global ( hawley & stone 1995 ) for the 3d simulations .",
    "both codes solve the mhd equations using time - explicit eulerian finite differencing and the constrained transport method to evolve the magnetic field .",
    "the poisson solver used to calculate the gravitational potential @xmath1 involves two steps : we first calculate @xmath1 on the boundary , using the legendre functions well - suited to the cylindrical geometry ( cohl 1999 ) , and we apply the successive over - relaxation method to update @xmath1 everywhere on the grid ( hirsch 1988 ) .",
    "we have built an initial equilibrium structure using the self  consistent field ( scf ) method ( hachisu 1986 ) .",
    "the inner and outer radii of the torus are @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "we set the angular velocity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the cylindrical radius .",
    "a central mass having half the mass of the disk is present .",
    "the equation of state is adiabatic .    in the following ,",
    "we compare the evolution of this torus to its zero mass counterpart , the gravitational potential of the latter being only that of a central point mass . at the beginning of the simulation , a weak poloidal magnetic field",
    "is added to the equilibrium structure , with the toroidal component of the vector potential being :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the mass density .",
    "the components of the magnetic field are then scaled such that the volume averaged ratio of gas to magnetic pressure ( hereafter called @xmath8 ) equals @xmath9 for the self - gravitating model and @xmath10 for the zero mass one .",
    "the resolution in both model is @xmath11 in the radial and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "we found the mri grows in both models , developing approximately the same maxwell stress ( defined by @xmath12 ) . in the self - gravitating case ,",
    "the evolution is very similar to what was found in previous non self  gravitating calculations ( e.g. hawley [ 2000 ) ] .",
    "namely , the initial linear growth of the instability is followed by a turbulent phase during which angular momentum is transported outward .",
    "turbulence then gradually decays because of the anti - dynamo theorem .",
    "we show in figure @xmath13 the logarithm of the density field in the @xmath14 plane during the turbulent phase for both models . in the self - gravitating case ( _",
    "left panel _ ) , the initial torus has developed a two - component structure , composed of an inner thin disk fed by an outer thick , massive torus .",
    "figure @xmath15 shows the angular momentum @xmath16 radial profile in the equatorial plane during this phase ( _ solid line _ ) . as shown by the dashed line ,",
    "the inner disk is in keplerian rotation around the central mass .",
    "the dotted line is a fit of the outer part of the disk with a power law dependence @xmath17 , very close to the mestel profile @xmath18 .",
    "coming back to figure @xmath13 , the comparison between both models is striking : although the maxwell stress is similar in the two cases , the self - gravitating torus presents a much more featureless structure than its zero mass counterpart .",
    "this result is due to the large scale coherence of the self - gravitating potential , which smoothes mri fluctuations .",
    "we shall see that this effect persists in 3d .",
    "in this section , we present the results of our 3d simulations .",
    "as above , we have used the scf method to compute the disk model , but with different parameters . here",
    "the central mass is twice that of the disk , and the specific angular momentum @xmath16 in the disk is chosen such that    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the mass inside the radius @xmath5 divided by the total disk mass .",
    "the density contours of this disk model are shown in figure @xmath21 ( left panel ) .",
    "we introduce the toomre parameter @xmath22 defined by :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the sound speed , @xmath25 the epicyclic frequency and @xmath26 the surface density of the disk .",
    "linear studies have shown that a disk becomes gravitationally unstable when @xmath22 is of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "the radial profile of @xmath22 in our disk model is shown on the right panel of figure @xmath21 .",
    "we have @xmath27 over a large range of radii .",
    "we therefore expect the disk to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "we have performed hydrodynamical simulations to check that our code behaves as expected in this regime . in the simulations presented here , the resolution is @xmath28 in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the azimuthal domain is restricted to @xmath29 $ ] , which prevents the growth of modes with odd values of the azimuthal number @xmath30 .",
    "time is measured in units of the orbital period at the initial outer edge of the disk .",
    "the time evolution of the fourier component of the density in the equatorial plane is shown in figure @xmath31 for the modes @xmath32 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "the @xmath0 mode grows at the beginning of the simulation and saturates after @xmath31 orbits .",
    "the development of this 2  arms spiral structure can be seen on figure  @xmath33 , which shows the logarithm of the density in the equatorial plane after @xmath34 orbits .    during the simulation",
    ", matter is driven toward the center of the disk by the gravitational torque associated with the spiral arms . as the surface density in the disk decreases , the toomre @xmath22 parameter increases . as a result ,",
    "the instability dies away after 8  orbits .",
    "these results are in agreement with earlier simulations of similar disks .",
    "next , we have performed a 3d mhd calculation of the evolution of the disk in an axisymmetric gravitational potential , i.e. a potential for which we have retained only the @xmath35 component .",
    "this prevents the growth of gravitational instabilities and enables us to check the behavior of our code in the mhd regime .",
    "the resolution used for this run is @xmath36 and the azimuthal domain is @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "a toroidal magnetic field with @xmath38 is added to the equilibrium model .",
    "the left panel of figure  6 shows the time evolution of the volume averaged maxwell and reynolds stress tensors .",
    "the maxwell stress rises during the early part of the evolution ( corresponding to the linear development of the instability ) before the mri breaks down into turbulence after 4  orbits .",
    "the reynolds stress is smaller during the whole simulation .",
    "the right panel of figure  6 shows the radial profile of the @xmath39 parameter ( defined as the ratio of the total stress to the thermal pressure ) at the end of the simulation .",
    "it has a typical value of a few times @xmath40 , similar to values seen in 3d simulations of zero mass disks starting with similar magnetic field configurations ( steinacker & papaloizou 2002 ) .      in this section",
    ", we present the results of the simulation in which both the mri and gravitational instabilities can develop .",
    "we include the fourier components of the gravitational potential up to @xmath41 .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field that we add to the equilibrium structure is the same as that described in the previous section . for this calculation , the resolution is @xmath42 and the azimuthal domain is @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "as expected , we observe the simultaneous appearance of mhd turbulence along with the @xmath0 spiral arm reminiscent of the hydrodynamical calculation . to analyze the angular momentum transport properties ,",
    "we compare the time evolution of the volume averaged gravitational and maxwell stress tensors obtained in this simulation with that obtained in the runs described above .",
    "note that the gravitational stress tensor is defined by :    @xmath44    the left panel of figure  7 shows @xmath45 as a function of time for this simulation ( _ dotted line _ ) and during the hydrodynamical run ( _ solid line _ ) .",
    "we can see that the presence of mhd turbulence decreases the strength of the gravitational stress by a factor of about @xmath15 .",
    "this result shows that mhd turbulence and the gravitational instability strongly interact with each other .",
    "the time evolution of the maxwell stress is shown on the right panel of figure  7 for the full simulation ( _ dotted line _ ) and for the mhd run in an axisymmetric potential ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "we see that the maxwell stress increases when the gravitational instability develops .",
    "this appears to be due to the accumulation of the magnetic field along the spiral arms .",
    "when the gravitational instability disappears after about 7  orbits ( because of a decrease of the mass density ) , the maxwell stress goes back to its `` turbulent '' value .    to test the sensitivity of our results to the initial field topology",
    ", we have run the same calculation with an initial poloidal magnetic field .",
    "we found the same qualitative results .",
    "we have presented here the first global simulations of massive , magnetized disks .    using 2d axisymmetric numerical simulations",
    ", we have shown that the properties of the mri are similar in self  gravitating and zero mass disks .",
    "we observe that these disks quickly develop a dual structure composed of an inner thin disk in keplerian rotation around the central mass , and a thicker outer torus whose rotation profile is close to a mestel profile .",
    "we have then used 3d simulations to study the angular momentum transport properties in disks when both mhd turbulence and gravitational instabilities are present .",
    "we have found that the gravitational instability is affected by the presence of the turbulence : the gravitational stress tensor is decreased by roughly a factor of @xmath15 when compared with hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "this results in a smaller mass accretion rate toward the central object .",
    "gravitating disks may therefore have a longer lifetime than previously thought .",
    "note that the simulations presented here use an adiabatic equation of state . in this case , all the energy generated in shocks and compression is locally converted into heat .",
    "this prevents the formation of bound objects by gravitational collapse .",
    "the opposite case would correspond to the use of a locally isothermal equation of state , for which all the energy generated is immediately radiated away .",
    "several authors ( mayer et al . 2002 , rice et al . 2003 , boss 1997 & 1998 ) have indeed reported gravitational collapse in isothermal calculations of disks , although this issue is still under debate ( pickett et al .",
    "we believe that the presence of mhd turbulence affects the thermal balance in the disk and therefore needs to be included .",
    "we are currently performing calculations of isothermal massive and magnetized disks .",
