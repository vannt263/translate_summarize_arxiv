    "the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) has been a great puzzle in particle physics and cosmology . from the latest observations of the cosmic microwave background radiations , the supernovae and the large scale structures , the baryon - to - photon ratio is given by  @xcite",
    "@xmath6 the nonzero bau can be generated if the following three conditions are fulfilled  @xcite : ( i ) baryon number ( @xmath7 ) violation , ( ii ) @xmath8 and @xmath0 violation , and ( iii ) departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis is a scenario in which the bau is explained based only on electroweak physics  @xcite . the standard model ( sm ) can in principle",
    "accommodate above three conditions .",
    "however , it turns out that the sm fails to generate the bau due to the lack of sufficient @xmath0 violation  @xcite , and the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is a smooth cross over for @xmath9 gev  @xcite , which makes the condition ( iii ) infeasible .",
    "this failure motivates us to go beyond the sm .",
    "so far , many attempts of electroweak baryogenesis have been made in the various new physics models such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , the two - higgs - doublet model  @xcite , the singlet - extended mssms  @xcite , and recently the fourth - generation models also have been paid much attention  @xcite . among them ,",
    "the mssm is a theoretically well - motivated model and a good candidate for successful electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "as far as the strong first order ewpt which is necessary for condition ( iii ) is concerned , the light higgs boson is generically favored . on the other hand , the negative results of the higgs boson(s )",
    "searches at lep put the constraints on the higgs boson masses in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the analysis has been done based on several benchmarks rather than scanning whole parameter space .",
    "recently , it is pointed out that the lep constraints can be relaxed in the more general case . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the lightest higgs boson mass can be smaller than the @xmath1 boson mass .",
    "such a light higgs boson can be viable since its coupling to @xmath1 boson is modified by the additional higgs bosons and suppressed enough to avoid the experimental observed limits .",
    "we call a light higgs boson scenario ( lhs ) when the mass of the lightest higgs boson is less than 114.4 gev",
    ". this scenario can accommodate the @xmath10 excess around 98 gev higgs boson mass in the lep experiments  @xcite and have parameter space that is consistent with the observed dark matter relic density  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is claimed that the lhs can provide a solution for a little hierarchy problem as well .",
    "as for the electroweak baryogenesis context , since the neutral higgs bosons are relatively light , they may give a new window to a viable baryogenesis scenario .",
    "in the electroweak baryogenesis mechanism , a sphaleron process must be decoupled after the ewpt in order to avoid the washout of the generated bau .",
    "because of this requirement , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to the temperature in question should be greater than some value . to search for the region where the strong first order ewpt is realized , and which is also experimentally allowed , not only the theoretical calculations of the zero temperature observables but also those at the finite temperature are mandatory .",
    "the accuracy of the former calculations are already beyond at least the tree level . on the other hand ,",
    "the sphaleron decoupling condition , which is derived using the tree - level higgs potential at zero temperature , has been frequently used to discuss the strength of the strong first order ewpt in the literature .",
    "namely , @xmath11 is adopted as a practical criterion , where @xmath12 is the critical temperature at which the higgs potential has two degenerate minima and @xmath13 is the higgs vev at @xmath12 . to obtain more accurate theoretical predictions , the refined calculation of the sphaleron decoupling condition is indispensable .",
    "the uncertainties of the condition is expected to be reduced up to about 10% level if we make the following improvements , i.e. , the sphaleron solution at finite temperature is used and the contributions from the zero modes of the fluctuations around sphaleron at finite temperature are taken into account .",
    "in addition , the sphaleron decoupling condition must be imposed at the temperature @xmath14 lower than @xmath12 , at which the ewpt terminates . in practice , since it is difficult to determine this temperature , we substitute @xmath15 , a nucleation temperature of the critical bubble , in place of @xmath14 .",
    "the critical bubble is defined as the bubble whose surface energy and volume energy becomes balanced .",
    "only such bubbles can nucleate and expand in the symmetric phase .    in this article ,",
    "the possibility of the strong first order ewpt in the lhs and the conventional decoupling limit is examined with a particular emphasis on the refinement of the sphaleron decoupling condition .",
    "the analysis is conducted taking the latest experimental data into account as well .",
    "it is well known that a light stop whose mass is smaller than that of top quark is required for the strong first order ewpt .",
    "we search for the parameter space that is consistent with such a light stop . in the lhs ,",
    "since the masses of all the higgs bosons are relatively light , typically , @xmath16 gev , the @xmath7 physics observables data can restrict the allowed region . here",
    ", we consider the constraints from the following processes : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the first two modes are relevant when the charged higgs bosons are light .",
    "the last one , which has not been observed yet , can give a significant limit when the neutral higgs boson is light .",
    "after finding the phenomenologically allowed region , we investigate the strength of the ewpt at not only @xmath12 but also @xmath15 . by using the one - loop effective potential at zero and finite temperatures ,",
    "we calculate the sphaleron energy and the contributions from zero modes of the fluctuations around sphaleron to evaluate the sphaleron decoupling condition .",
    "it is then demonstrated whether or not such an improved sphaleron decoupling condition is satisfied at @xmath12 and @xmath15 .    this article is organized as follows : in sec .  [",

    "what follows , the contributions of the weak gauge bosons ( @xmath42 ) , the third - generation quarks ( @xmath43 ) , and squarks ( @xmath44 ) are taken into account .",
    "the statistical factors of each particle is , respectively , given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of color .",
    "in this article , we use the one - loop mass formulae of the higgs bosons presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "to make a discussion on the lhs clear , we rotate the two higgs doublets @xmath47 into @xmath48 by @xmath49 . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath0 is conserved for the moment .",
    "the rotated higgs doublets are cast into the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 gev , @xmath39 is the @xmath0-odd higgs boson , @xmath52 is the charged higgs boson and ( @xmath53 ) are the nambu - goldstone bosons . @xmath54 and @xmath55 are related to the physical @xmath0-even higgs bosons ( @xmath56 ) via @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a mixing angle between @xmath59 and @xmath60 . it should be noticed that only @xmath54 possesses the higgs vev in the rotated basis , and we can identify it the sm - like higgs boson , i.e. , @xmath61 .    at the tree level ,",
    "the higgs boson couplings to @xmath1 boson normalized to the corresponding sm values are , respectively , given by @xmath62 from eqs .",
    "( [ rotated_phi ] ) , ( [ rotated_h ] ) , ( [ higgs_zz ] ) and ( [ higgs_za ] ) , one can see that @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the former case ( decoupling limit ) is realized by taking @xmath71 and the latter one ( antidecoupling limit ) is possible for @xmath72 , which corresponds to the lhs .",
    "depending on the theory parameters , some of the above four higgs boson couplings can be small enough to avoid the lep exclusion limits . in the lhs ,",
    "for example , @xmath73 can be as light as about 100 gev for @xmath74 .",
    "however , from the sum rules among the higgs boson couplings , i.e. , @xmath75 , not all higgs bosons are allowed to be light .",
    "if the higgs boson is the sm - like , the mass of it should be larger than 114.4 gev since its coupling to the @xmath1 boson becomes the sm value .",
    "we will discuss the experimental constraints in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : ex_const ]",
    ".    finally , we comment on the @xmath0-violating case .",
    "although @xmath0 is conserved in the tree - level higgs sector , it can be broken by the radiative corrections such as the top / stop loops .",
    "the realization of the maximal @xmath0 violation is called the cpx scenario  @xcite . in this scenario , it is possible to accommodate an even lighter higgs boson .",
    "for instance , the mass of the lightest higgs boson can be as small as 40 gev , which is experimentally viable .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the phenomenological consequences of this scenario .",
    "however , the cpx scenario requires the relatively large ratios of @xmath76 assuming @xmath77 , which is not favored in the context of the strong first order ewpt that we will discuss in the next section .",
    "to explain how the first order ewpt is strengthened in the mssm , we here give a brief review on the light stop scenario . to simplify the discussion , we use the high temperature expansion in the effective potential  @xcite . in the decoupling limit , @xmath73 is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking since @xmath78 . on the other hand , @xmath3",
    "is mostly shared by @xmath79 in the lhs .",
    "if the ewpt is first order , the critical temperature @xmath80 is given by the temperature at which the effective potential has two degenerate minima .",
    "let @xmath13 be the nonzero vev at @xmath12 . from the argument using the high temperature expansion : @xmath81 in @xmath82 , one can see that @xmath83 can be enhanced when the quartic term in @xmath27 gets smaller and/or the coefficient of the cubic term with a negative coefficient ( denoted @xmath84 ) becomes larger .",
    "the former implies that the light @xmath85 is favored in the decoupling / lhs limit .",
    "the latter can be realized by the additional contributions from the bosons .",
    "in fact , the effect of the lighter stop @xmath86 on @xmath84 is sizable due to the large top yukawa coupling constant ( @xmath87 ) and the degrees of freedom , i.e. , @xmath88 . in the high temperature expansion",
    ", one can obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 where @xmath91 and the @xmath92 contributions are neglected in the stop contribution , also the hierarchies between the soft susy breaking masses are implicitly assumed , namely , @xmath93 are taken to be consistent with the lep bounds on the higgs boson mass and the @xmath94 parameter . as a result of @xmath95 , which is necessary for the enhancement of the loop effect , the lighter stop",
    "mass becomes less than the top mass @xmath96 . from eq .",
    "( [ dele_hte ] ) , one can easily see that the no - mixing case @xmath97 maximizes the loop effect .",
    "if we assume @xmath98 , we obtain @xmath99 , which is about 6 times as large as the sm contributions .    to make the analysis on the ewpt",
    "precisely , the corrections from the daisy diagrams must be taken into account , which yield the temperature dependent terms in the field - dependent masses of particles .",
    "for the light stop , we effectively have the following mass shift to leading order : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is positive and composed of the relevant couplings in the theory .",
    "therefore , the ewpt would get weaker even if @xmath102 . nonetheless , as advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite the choice of @xmath103 , which can induce the charge - color - breaking ( ccb ) vacuum , may still realize the same enhancement of the stop loop effect as outlined above . for simplicity",
    ", we will not pursue this possibility and take @xmath104 putting the daisy diagrams aside in this article .",
    "our analysis on the strength of the ewpt is expected to be the same , or might be more optimistic than the more realistic case depending on the model parameters .",
    "the high temperature expansion makes it easy to see how the first order phase transition is strengthened analytically .",
    "it is , however , untrustworthy to use the approximation when the masses of the particles in loops are somewhat larger than @xmath12 .",
    "we thus adopt a different method .",
    "although the numerical integrations contained in the definitions of @xmath82 are the standard way , it is an extremely time - consuming task .",

    "<S> the electroweak phase transition and the sphaleron decoupling condition in the minimal supersymmetric standard model are revisited taking the latest experimental data into account . the light higgs boson scenario and the ordinary decoupling limit which are classified by the relative size between the @xmath0-odd higgs boson mass and @xmath1 boson mass </S>",
    "<S> are considered within the context of electroweak baryogenesis . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate @xmath2 at not only the critical temperature at which the effective potential has two degenerate minima but also the nucleation temperature of the critical bubbles , where @xmath3 is a vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson and @xmath4 denotes a temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that @xmath2 at the nucleation temperature can be enhanced by about 10% compared to that at the critical temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the sphaleron decoupling condition including the zero mode factors of the fluctuations around sphaleron . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that the sphaleron decoupling condition at the nucleation temperature is given by @xmath5 for the typical parameter sets . in any phenomenologically allowed region , @xmath2 at both the critical and nucleation temperatures can not be large enough to satisfy such a sphaleron decoupling condition . </S>"
