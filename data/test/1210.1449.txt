    "the theory of gravitational lensing has by now reached a considerable degree of sophistication @xcite .",

    "these general results have been complemented by a number of detailed calculations for specific types of lenses .",
    "the majority of such calculations have been performed within the quasi - newtonian viewpoint of gravitational lensing commonly used in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "while various flavors of this formalism exist , most require that bending angles be small and that all lenses be nearly - newtonian mass distributions .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the more fundamental picture of gravitational lensing where light rays are modelled as null geodesics in a lorentzian spacetime . within this context",
    ", specific lensing calculations have been performed in kerr , reissner - nordstrm , and a handful of other geometries @xcite .",
    "while curvatures and bending angles may be large in these examples , they all involve ( at least conformally ) stationary spacetimes .",
    "it is of interest to understand if qualitatively new effects appear in dynamical cases .",
    "this paper considers the bending of light by ( decidedly non - stationary ) plane - symmetric gravitational waves .",
    "gravitational lensing by gravitational waves has previously been considered by a number of authors , although almost all of this work has been carried out within the weak - field regime @xcite .",
    "one exception is @xcite , where redshifts were computed in an exact solution to the vacuum einstein equation representing a plane gravitational wave .",
    "this work considered only very specific waveforms , and was confined to a coordinate patch too small to include caustics and other effects associated with the formation of multiple images .",
    "separately , extensive work has been devoted to non - perturbatively understanding the geodesic structure of generic plane wave spacetimes @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a subject closely related to gravitational lensing , although few explicit relations between the two subjects appear to have been made ( see , however , remarks in @xcite ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to provide a comprehensive and non - perturbative discussion of lensing in plane wave spacetimes .",
    "these geometries are a well - known subclass of _ pp_-waves ; plane - fronted waves with parallel rays .",
    "many plane wave spacetimes are exact solutions to the vacuum einstein equation .",
    "others may be interpreted as , e.g. , exact solutions in einstein - maxwell theory . while rather idealized from the astrophysical perspective , plane wave spacetimes admit a wide variety of interesting phenomena .",
    "depending on the waveform , any number of astigmatic and anastigmatic caustics may exist .",
    "examples admitting any specified number of images  even an infinite number  are easily constructed .",
    "in particular , even numbers of images can exist @xcite . the image count can also change in time even when a source does not cross an observer s caustic . despite all of these properties , plane wave spacetimes are geometrically very mild .",
    "they are topologically equivalent to @xmath0 and admit coordinate systems which cover the entire manifold .    aside from their value as models of gravitational radiation ,",
    "the plane wave spacetimes considered here have also found numerous applications via the penrose limit .",
    "this limit provides a sense in which the metric near any null geodesic in any spacetime is equivalent to the metric of an appropriate plane wave spacetime @xcite .",
    "it allows problems in relatively complicated spacetimes to be reduced to equivalent problems in plane wave spacetimes ( which are often much simpler ) .",
    "this has been particularly valuable within string theory and related fields @xcite .",
    "penrose limits have also been applied to ordinary quantum field theory in order to investigate causality and effective indices of refraction for photons and gravitons propagating in curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "more recently , penrose limits were used to deduce the effect of caustics on green functions associated with the propagation of classical fields in curved spacetimes @xcite .",
    "given the content of the penrose limit , lensing in plane wave spacetimes might be related to lensing in generic spacetimes as seen by ultrarelativistic observers .",

    "plane wave spacetimes are not asymptotically flat . despite being topologically trivial and",
    "locally well - behaved , they are not even globally hyperbolic : null geodesics passing between appropriately - chosen pairs of points can extend to arbitrarily large transverse distances in between those points .",
    "it is this property which permits the infinite number of images described in sect .",
    "[ sect : symwaves ] to be produced by symmetric waves .",
    "the flashes described in sect .",
    "[ sect : sandwaves ] also depend on the spacetime structure at arbitrarily large distances .",
    "this structure likely affects the formation of even numbers of images as well .",
    "indeed , the usual proofs of the odd number theorem require global hyperbolicity , among other assumptions @xcite ( see , however , @xcite for a more general formulation ) .",
    "if a spacetime has the geometry of a plane wave only out to some finite transverse distance , all results derived here remain valid if the associated images involve light rays which never extend sufficiently far to interact with any large - distance modifications . the infinite sequence of images formed by a symmetric plane wave",
    "would then be expected to become finite for spacetimes which are only approximately plane waves .",
    "calculations involving the oldest images could no longer be trusted in these cases .",
    "similarly , the bright flashes associated with ideal sandwich waves are likely to be somewhat less extreme for waves which decay at infinity .",
    "large brightnesses and large blueshifts can still exist , but these will be cut off at some finite maximum .",
    "such maxima may , however , remain quite large .",
    "it is reasonably clear that modifications of the geometry at large distances can remove some images .",
    "less obviously , these modification can also introduce new images .",
    "consider , for example , the @xmath507-wave spacetimes obtained by substituting @xmath508 in the metric ( [ planewavemetric ] ) .",
    "these generalize the plane wave spacetimes .",
    "it has been shown that if @xmath509 grows subquadratically as @xmath510 , the resulting geometries are globally hyperbolic @xcite . moreover ,",
    "every pair of points is connected by at least one geodesic in these cases ( unlike in pure plane wave spacetimes where the growth of @xmath509 is precisely quadratic ) .",
    "this implies that modifications of the geometry at large transverse distances can introduce new null geodesics even between points at small transverse distances",
    ". it would be interesting to explore these effects in more depth to understand precisely how modifications of this sort ( or more general ones ) alter the lensing properties described here for ideal plane waves .",
    "it would also be interesting to better understand what the transient flashes of sect .",
    "[ sect : sandwaves ] imply for waves propagating on plane ( or almost - plane ) wave spacetimes .",
    "this can likely be facilitated by the green functions derived in @xcite .",
