    "controlling chaos consists in stabilizing nonlinear systems with chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the target state for control can be a steady state , a periodic orbit , or even a particular aperiodic trajectory in a chaotic attractor . the best way to achieve any of these goals depends on the nature of the situation modeled by the system .",
    "for instance , in population dynamics , control methods incorporating either harvesting or stocking , or both , are more appropriate than others , e.g. ogy method @xcite , which performs continuous small perturbations in the parameters of the system .    using ogy method , stabilization of otherwise unstable fixed point or cycle",
    "was achieved experimentally in @xcite .",
    "the experimental system consisted of a gravitationally buckled , amorphous magnetoelastic ribbon .",
    "the chosen ribbon material exhibited very large reversible changes of young s modulus with the application of small magnetic fields .",
    "oscillation of the ribbon were brought to a chosen regime using the control of the distance from the chosen orbit @xcite . however , the stabilized orbit had to be an orbit of the unperturbed system .",
    "the main motivation of our investigation is population dynamics where chaotic orbits coming close enough to zero can threaten population survival and cause unpredictable changes in a relevant food chain .",
    "higher density values may be as dangerous as low ones due to either extinction stipulated by the previous overpopulation and accumulated pollution @xcite , or connected to paradox of enrichment @xcite .",
    "if the target is pest eradication then harvesting at each time step can be an appropriate strategy .",
    "however , if the purpose is to keep the population in certain bounds , the control should incorporate both harvesting and stock recruitment .",
    "a recently suggested target oriented control @xcite seems to be an adequate method to achieve this goal : the control intensity , as in ogy method , depends on the deviation of the stock size from the chosen target ",
    "the more distant the population density from the target value , the more intensive the control is .",
    "since 2011 , when the target oriented control was introduced , there were several developments @xcite justifying a possibility to stabilize a fixed point ( for a prescribed target ) and exploring the form of the stock - recruitment dependency when such stabilization is possible .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to overcome the following shortcomings of previous contributions :    1 .",
    "most of control methods considered suitable for stabilizing population dynamics have been studied in the framework of first order difference equations @xcite . in any physical application",
    ", this means that we consider a scalar system only , and this system has no memory : the next state depends on the previous state only . in biological applications",
    ", first order equations can describe non - structured populations that survive for one season only , with overwintering offspring .",
    "the framework of higher order equations allows to consider multi - seasonal interactions even with non - overlapping generations .",
    "moreover , dynamics of a structured population in certain cases can be described by a higher order difference equation ; e.g. @xcite .",
    "2 .   ogy and several similar methods ( for example , prediction based control @xcite ) are focused on stabilization of either a fixed point or an unstable orbit of the original system .",
    "other strategies , such as proportional feedback @xcite , involve harvesting only and stabilize a point which is typically closer to zero than fixed points of the non - controlled equation",
    ". however , physical or ecological considerations ( for example , required density to sustain functioning of a food chain or providing a sufficient supply for harvesting ) lead to the necessity to stabilize a point which _ is not _ a fixed point of the system . here",
    "we illustrate that , with target oriented control , it is possible . it will allow to keep a controlled population at a prescribed level , certainly , at a cost .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a general control strategy with the goal of stabilizing steady states of a broad class of higher order difference equations which include chaotic and non - chaotic systems .",
    "we recall that first order difference equations @xmath5 are suitable for modeling single species populations with non - overlapping generations .",
    "the map @xmath6 usually takes the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 being a positive decreasing map regulating the intraspecific competition for resources . the ricker model @xcite , @xmath9 , and the beverton - holt model @xcite , @xmath10 ,",
    "are examples of broadly used in theoretical ecology",
    ". however , the evidence of the existence of explicit time lags in the intraspecific regulatory mechanisms for some species @xcite makes it necessary to incorporate delays in the equations to obtain more realistic models .",
    "examples of such equations related to the ricker and beverton - holt models are the delay ricker equation @xcite @xmath11 and the pielou equation @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a fixed natural number determining the time lag . clearly , both and are special cases of the @xmath14th - order difference equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , similarly to the first order equation , the higher order difference equation , and particularly and , can show complicated dynamics .",
    "therefore , the design and study of control strategies for the higher order equation is a natural extension of the stabilization problem for the first order equation .    here ,",
    "we generalize a method called target oriented control .",
    "target oriented control ( toc ) method @xmath18 was developed in @xcite with the aim to stabilize the dynamics of the first order equation .",
    "parameter @xmath19 is called target and parameter @xmath20 measures the control intensity .",
    "essentially , toc increases the state variable if it is smaller than the target and reduces it if it is larger . for the values of @xmath20 close enough to one",
    ", toc can provide global stabilization of unimodal maps with a negative schwarzian derivative @xcite and some other models , where the smoothness conditions are relaxed @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we note that is a combination of the linear transformation of the variable @xmath21 and the function @xmath6 . moreover , if we switch the order and consider the modified target oriented control ( mtoc ) @xmath22 then the fixed point @xmath23 of the controlled equation is globally ( locally ) asymptotically stable if and only if the fixed point @xmath24 of is globally ( locally ) asymptotically stable .",
    "the framework of mtoc provides a natural generalization of target control methods to higher order difference equations .",
    "in particular , we propose the following control applied to the uncontrolled equation @xmath25 further we will refer to the controlled equation as hmtoc ( higher - order modified target oriented control ) .    if we assume the zero target @xmath26 in , then we obtain the proportional feedback method ( pf ) , @xmath27 consisting in a reduction of the state variable , proportional to the size of this variable @xcite .",
    "the assumption of the proportional reduction is aligned with the idea of constant effort harvesting , without any stocking . in",
    ", harvesting occurs before reproduction . switching the variable reduction function @xmath28",
    "with the map @xmath6 , we get a modified proportional feedback method ( mpf ) in which harvesting takes place after reproduction @xmath29 similarly , the control in can be extended to involve higher order methods .",
    "we obtain a modified version of the proportional feedback control for higher order equations @xmath30 which is a particular case of hmtoc for the target @xmath26 .",
    "the main results of the present paper are the following :    1 .",
    "we obtain sufficient conditions for local and global stabilization of a fixed point with hmtoc .",
    "as illustrated by numerical examples , some of these conditions are sharp .",
    "2 .   stabilization of the zero equilibrium with the proportional feedback method is considered as a particular case of the above results .",
    "the minimal stabilizing control intensity @xmath20 is estimated .",
    "the flexibility for the choice of the point to be stabilized is one of the advantages of hmtoc .",
    "however , stabilization conditions depend on this choice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 deals with local stabilization of higher order equations . in section 3",
    ", we justify the possibility of global stabilization .",
    "section 4 contains the proof of the fact that with target oriented control , any prescribed point can be stabilized .",
    "some examples and numerical illustrations are presented in section 5 .",
    "finally , section 6 contains a summary .",
    "our first result gives a sufficient condition for hmtoc to have at least a positive fixed point for all control intensities .",
    "it complements and slightly generalizes lemma 1 in @xcite .",

    ", it is convenient to have an estimation as good as possible for @xmath46 in the statement of theorem  [ p_esta ] . following its proof",
    ", this essentially reduces to prove that a polynomial is a schur polynomial ( i.e. with all roots smaller than one in module ) .",
    "although there are characterizations for a schur polynomial , as for example the schur test or the jury conditions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollaries 3.4.91 and 3.4.98 ) , obtaining an explicit expression for @xmath46 is difficult for two main reasons .",
    "first , because if @xmath14 is large , then expressions in these characterizations get too complicated .",
    "second , because we need to know with precision the interval @xmath43 where the fixed point @xmath34 of hmtoc is , in order to reduce the range of possible values for the partial derivatives of @xmath4 .",
