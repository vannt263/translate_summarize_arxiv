    "cosmic rays have a non - thermal spectrum well approximated by a power law close to @xmath0 for 10 orders of magnitude in energy , from @xmath1 ev to above @xmath2 ev , and 30 orders of magnitude in the flux .",
    "the flux goes from 1 particle/(m@xmath3 sec ) at 10@xmath4 ev , to 1 particle/(m@xmath3yr ) at 10@xmath5 ev , to 1 particle/(km@xmath3yr ) at 10@xmath6 ev ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the non - thermal spectrum of cosmic rays indicates that their acceleration results from stochastic processes in the presence of magnetic fields , as first proposed by fermi .",
    "the diffusive acceleration of charged particles in the shock waves of supernova explosions may give origin to most cosmic rays .",
    "but the highest energies of cosmic rays are so extreme that it is not understood if a similar mechanism can accelerate these particles even in the most extreme sources , which may or may not be large enough and have sufficiently large magnetic fields .",
    "each energy range of cosmic rays addresses different physics . from 10@xmath7 ev to 10@xmath8 ev the modulation of the incoming charged particles by the solar wind can be studied .",
    "the expanding plasma generated by the sun decelerates and partially sweeps - off the lower energy galactic cosmic rays from the vicinity of the earth .",
    "this effect depends on the level of solar activity , which has an 11 year cycle . from 10@xmath8 ev to 10@xmath9 or 10@xmath10 ev , cosmic rays allow us to study the galactic sources that produce them and the propagation of charged particles within the galaxy . above this energy range and up to",

    "the pamela satellite ( payload for antimatter exploration and light - nuclei astrophysics ) , consists of a magnetic spectrometer in orbit , launched in june 2006 , and has produced its first data releases in 2008 .",
    "of particular interest has been the positron fraction @xmath13 data the pamela collaboration announced first in july 2008  @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) , which shows an excess in the 10 -100 gev range with respect to what is expected from secondary cosmic rays , i.e. a fraction diminishing as the energy increases ( secondary electrons and some positrons are produced in the interactions of cosmic ray protons and heavier nuclei ) .",
    "this result confirms what was earlier called theheat excess \"  @xcite , also observed by ams-01",
    "@xcite . fig .",
    "1 shows the pamela data ( in red ) and the data of several prior experiments ( in black ) .",
    "the large dispersion in the data seen at energies below a few gev is expected , because the different experiments were done in different moments of the solar cycle . above 10 gev",
    "the solar modulation is not important and this is the range where the excess is significant . as seen in fig .  1",
    ", the positron fraction is about 0.05 at 10 gev and grows steadily with energy to reach 0.1 - 0.2 at 100 gev .    soon after the publication of the pamela positron data , in november 2008 , the atic collaboration announced a 6@xmath14 excess in the @xmath15 flux in the range 300 to 800 gev  @xcite , with respect to what is expected from secondary cosmic rays .",
    "if the pamela positron fraction excess is due to an excess of positrons ( as opposed to a defect of electrons , which are much more abundant than positrons in secondary cosmic rays ) it may mean that positrons and electrons are been created by an unknown source .",
    "the excess electron flux in the pamela energy range would not be noticed until it becomes comparable to , and then larger than , the secondary electron flux as the energy increases .",
    "if this is so , atic may have measured the continuation to higher energies of the excess found by pamela .",

    "@xcite ) ]    atic ( the advanced thin ionization calorimeter instrument ) is a balloon born calorimeter launched from the mcmurdo base in antarctica , which has flown several times .",
    "the data presented are from the 2000 - 2001 and 2002 - 2003 flights .",
    "a few days after the announcement of atic , the hess collaboration published its @xmath15 flux measurement above 600 gev , which is steeply falling with increasing energy  @xcite .",
    "fig .  2 ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows the data of hess , atic and other earlier experiments .",
    "the @xmath15 flux is multiplied by @xmath16 .",
    "the double arrow shows the possible shift of the hess spectrum due to @xmath17% energy scale uncertainty and the shaded area indicates the approximate range of the systematic error in the hess spectrum due to other reasons .",
    "the hess data show that , if the atic data are correct , there is a sharp cutoff of any excess above about 800 gev , which is compatible with the sharp cutoff expected from dark matter particle annihilation at the parent particle mass .",
    "since their appearance , at the moment of writing these notes the data of pamela and atic have generated more than 50 papers , at the rate of several per week , providing different explanations for their excesses .",
    "the main two explanations are the existence of an astrophysical source nearby , or dark matter particles annihilating nearby , within a volume around earth much smaller than the volume of the galaxy .",
    "electron and positrons rapidly loose energy through synchrotron and inverse compton processes , thus at the energies observed they must come from less than 1 kpc away ( for comparison , the distance between the sun and the center of the galaxy is about 8 kpc ) .",
    "known possible astrophysical sources are pulsars , of which there are some , such as geminga and vela , within a few 100 pc from earth  @xcite .",
    "it is not known the mechanism through which they would produce such energetic electrons and positrons , thus the spectrum they could produce is unknown too .",
    "the maximum energy cutoff of the spectrum observed would in this case correspond to the maximum energy of emission of positrons and electrons .    in the case of annihilating dark matter particles",
    ", the cutoff in energy would correspond to the mass of the parent particle .",
    "the cutoff could be very sharp if the particles annihilate directly into @xmath18 pairs , and this would be a clear indication of the dark matter origin of the signal  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "if instead @xmath18 are produced after a chain of decays of annihilation products , the cutoff would be less sharp , similar to what would be expected from astrophysical sources .",
    "fig .  4 ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) shows three fits to the atic data , assuming an astrophysical source , a dark matter particle annihilating directly to @xmath18 and another producing @xmath18 as secondaries of the annihilation products .    in order to account for the pamela and/or atic data , the annihilation rate of most dark matter candidates needs to be enhanced by a factor , called",
    " boost factor \" @xmath19 , which may reach @xmath20 in the case of many usual wimp dark matter candidates  @xcite and may be much smaller , close to @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , for some candidates that decay preferentially into electrons and positrons ( the atic collaboration finds that a kaluza - klein particle decaying mostly into electrons and positrons with mass 620 gev fits well their electron - positron data  @xcite ) .",
    "examples of fits to the atic data assuming a pulsar nearby ( red ) , the annihilation of 800 gev dark matter particles producing @xmath18 as secondaries with @xmath22 ( blue ) and the annihilation of 620 gev kaluza - klein dark matter particle decaying directly into @xmath18 with @xmath23 ( black ) . from ref .",
    "@xcite ]    several ways of enhancing the local annihilation rate have been proposed : there could be a dense dark matter clamp nearby ( however , the probability found in structure formation simulations for this to happen is about 10@xmath24  @xcite ) , which would enhance the rate , which depends on the square of the dark matter density , or the annihilation cross section itself could be enhanced . for example",
    "a  sommerfeld resonance \" results from the almost formation of a bound state by the annihilating particles at very small relative velocities .",
    "this effect would enhance the annihilation cross section in the dark halo ( but not in the early universe , where the particles move at larger velocities )  @xcite .",
    "whatever produces the positron excess seen by pamela should not produce an excess of antiprotons , since the antiproton to proton ratio @xmath25 was also measured by pamela  @xcite and is compatible with what is expected from secondary cosmic rays .",
    "this could be partially explained because there are many more protons than electrons in the secondary cosmic rays ( pamela requires a 10@xmath26 discrimination of protons to measure positrons ) and because @xmath27 and @xmath28 reach us from a larger volume than @xmath29 and @xmath30 , from a large fraction of the total volume of the galaxy .",
    "the fermi space telescope ( ex glast - gamma - ray large area space telescope ) can also detect @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( it does discriminate between the two ) , besides photons .",
    "fermi was launched in june 2008 and is providing @xmath31-ray spectroscopic data of unprecedented quality .",
    "it has two detectors ( the glast burst monitor , gmb , and the large area telescope , lat ) which detect photons between 10 kev and 300 gev , and observe the whole sky every 3 hours .",
    "photons of even higher energy will be detected by air cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) , cangaroo iii in australia , hess in namibia , magic in las palmas and veritas in the us ( see the talk of manel martinez in this conference ) .",
    "these can also detect @xmath32 , as we already mentioned in the case of hess .",
    "the universe is totally transparent to photons below 100 gev . at higher energies photons",
    "interact with infra - red and optical backgrounds but still at energies below 10 s of tev arrive to us from cosmological distances ( at higher energies they are absorbed by the cosmic microwave background radiation ) .",
    "photons can again reach earth from cosmological distance at energies above @xmath1 gev , the range of uhecr .",
    "the photons observed by fermi reveal , therefore , the spacial distribution of their sources .",
    "in particular , if fermi observes the annihilation of dark matter particles into photons , it is expected to detect not only the center of our galaxy but also a large amount of dark matter clumps . as mentioned above , since the annihilation rate depends on the square of the density , high density regions boost the rate . a large amount of dark matter clumps",
    "are expected to remain within the dark halo of our galaxy .",
    "haloes grow hierarchically , incorporating lumps and tidal streams from earlier phases of structure formation .",
    "the best simulations of structure formation at present ( the via lactea ii  @xcite and the aquarius project  @xcite ) show that 10 s of subhaloes could be discovered by fermi .",
    "however , subhaloes are more effectively destroyed by tidal effects near the center of the galaxy , thus most of them are far from the sun . the chance that a random point close to the sun is lying within a clump is smaller than 10@xmath24  @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies and other objects which fermi might observe as a whole through dark matter annihilation into photons will have the annihilation rate increased by a boost factor @xmath19 , may be as large of 100 , due to the existence of substructure within them ( with respect to the rate they would have without dark matter lumps ) . but",
    "the concept of a boost factor can not be applied to the possible enhancement of a signal in electron and positrons as seen by pamela or atic , since at most only one or very few dark matter clump could be present within the volume these particles come from .",
    "the fermi space telescope can measure the @xmath15 flux in the range explored by atic , possibly to 1tev , with better accuracy and its results are expected to be made public soon , in the april 2009 meeting of the american physical society ( which will take place in the first week of may 2009 ) .",

    "is well known because cosmic ray particles are detected directly .",
    "the composition and flux of cosmic rays at these energies are in agreement with their production in galactic supernova explosions  @xcite .",
    "direct measurements above the atmosphere to energies slightly above 10@xmath40 ev are performed by various instruments , such as atic , cream , bess and tracer . at higher energies ,",
    "the flux of cosmic rays becomes smaller than several particles /(m@xmath3 day ) so their detection with instruments carried in balloons or spacecrafts becomes impractical and cosmic rays are detected from the ground through the shower of secondary particles they produced in the atmosphere .",
    "these are called extensive air showers ( eas ) .",
    "arrays of detectors covering a large area , usually from a fraction to many km@xmath3 , operate for years to obtain enough statistics .",
    "because of the sparse sampling of the shower , the uncertainties in the modeling of the shower development and the large statistical fluctuations in the interactions in the atmosphere , the inferred energy and characteristics of the shower can only determine the relative contribution of groups of elements to the cosmic ray flux .",
    "for example , a heavy nucleus ( usually referred to just as  iron \" ) generates a shower with a relatively higher ratio of muons to electrons that a proton initiated shower of the same energy .",
    "a good understanding of the composition around the knee would help determining what is the origin of this feature , but this is difficult .",
    "the best measurements of the composition of cosmic rays in the knee region come from the kascade ( karlsruhe shower core and array detector ) experiment , which observes a steepening of the spectrum first of light elements and successively at higher energies for heavier ones  @xcite ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "the knee can be explained by the cutoff of the galactic proton spectrum due to the leakage of protons from the galaxy .",
    "the galactic magnetic fields are not strong enough to keep protons of this energy bound to the galaxy .",
    "heavier elements are bound to the galaxy up to higher energies , so their cutoff energy increases approximately as their charge @xmath34 .",

    "figure taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ]    the interpretation of the second knee is linked to that of the ankle .",
    "the second knee is sometimes explained by the fall off of the heaviest elements ( including elements heavier than iron ) in the galactic cosmic rays  @xcite ( see fig .",

    "he was first in understanding that extensive air showers are produced by high energy cosmic rays .",
    "giuseppe cocconi argued in 1956 that cosmic rays above the ankle are extragalactic in origin because they can not be confined by the galactic magnetic field . in 1962",
    "john linsley at volcano ranch in new mexico observed the first 10@xmath11 ev shower .    immediately after the discovery of the microwave background radiation by penzias and wilson in 1965 , in two separate papers in 1966 , greisen , and independently zatsepin and kuzmin  @xcite pointed out that if the uhecr are of extragalactic origin there should be an absorption feature in their spectrum at about 4@xmath44 ev , the so called  gzk cut - off \" . in fact , if the uhecr are extragalactic their energy is degraded by inelastic collisions with background photons as they propagate .",

    "if the suppression of the cosmic rays spectrum at 4@xmath44 ev is due to the gzk effect , namely to the interactions with the cmb photons , then the cosmic rays with higher energies should come from nearby sources .",
    "for example , above 6@xmath44 ev 90% of the protons should come from less than about 200 mpc away , while 50% should come from less than 90 mpc away .",

    "there is a lack of events in the region of the virgo cluster which seems to be present also in the data of the hires collaboration",

    "hires observed mostly the northern sky and auger the southern , could they be significantly different ?    given the small statistics of the sample and the negative results of hires , the correlation found by auger does not prove that the sources of uhecr are agns .",
    "the sources may be any astrophysical objects with a space distribution similar to agns .",
    "are agn the sources or just tracers of the sources ?",
    "nuclei are attenuated by photodisintegration in the intergalactic medium and intermediate mass nuclei ( a @xmath81 ) would have to reach us from distances shorter than 70 mpc .",
    "heavier nuclei , close to fe have horizons comparable to that of protons but they would be deflected in the magnetic field of our galaxy by more than 3@xmath79 .",
    "thus the correlation indicates that the primary uhecr are most likely protons .",
    "however , in the case the primaries are protons , the actual sources of the uhecr may be further out than 70 mpc .",
    "we mentioned above that the  gzk horizon \" ( defined as the distance from earth which contains the sources that produce 90% of the protons which arrive with energies above a given threshold ) should be about 200 mpc for protons of energy above 6 @xmath44 gev , while it would be 70 mpc for about 9 @xmath44 gev .",
    "this may indicate that the energy calibration of auger should be shifted upwards by 30% or that there are accidental correlations with agns that are closer than the actual uhecr sources .",
    "the correlation with agns found by auger seems to indicate that the highest energy cosmic rays are protons , while the composition data of auger suggest a change towards a heavier composition above @xmath82 ev . which of these two pieces of information is correct",
    "? there may also be a problem with the programs used to simulates the showers and determine if they are proton or iron like .",
    "data from lhcf are needed to improve them .",
    "clearly more data are needed to answer all these questions , and they are coming .",

    "there is also the jem - euso mission in preparation , the extreme universe space observatory that will be hosted in the japanese experimental module of the international space station , that will study very energetic cosmic ray showers from space .",
