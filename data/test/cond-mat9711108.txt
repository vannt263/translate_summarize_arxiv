    "a general feature of nonequilibrium steady states is the presence of currents ( fluxes ) of some physical quantities such as energy , momentum , charge , etc .",
    "thus the study of nonequilibrium steady states is , in some sense , a study of the effects of currents imposed on the system either by boundary conditions and driving fields or by competing dynamical processes .",
    "an interesting and much investigated effect of currents is the rather dramatic change in correlations .",
    "namely , short - range correlations appear to change into long - range , power - law ones as the currents are switched on .",
    "this is not entirely surprising in case of a global current since some conserved quantity is carried fast compared to diffusion and , in the absence of detailed balance , this may generate long - range effective interactions and , as a consequence , long - range correlations may appear @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that the general picture should be more complicated since large currents often lead to chaotic behavior which in turn results in weakened correlations @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe , the understanding of the interplay of currents and correlations in nonequilibrium steady states is a rather interesting and important task .    in order to achieve progress one tries to investigate simple models and , indeed , a large number of classical statistical models have been introduced for the study of nonequilibrium steady states @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , far from equilibrium , classical systems are not constrained by conditions like detailed balance and there is much arbitrariness in defining the dynamics . in order to avoid such arbitrariness ,",
    "we have started to investigate quantum systems @xcite where the time evolution is defined without ambiguity by the usual rules of quantum mechanics .",
    "nonequilibrium steady states in a quantum system may be investigated by imposing a current on the system and studying the properties of the ground state thus generated . as an example",
    ", we studied the transverse ising model @xcite and found that , in the presence of an energy current , the exponentially decaying two - spin correlations changed into power - law form thus supporting the notion that switching on currents increases correlations . in view of the lack of detailed knowledge of the interplay of currents and correlations , here",
    "we probe the generality of the above result on the example of the isotropic transverse xy chain . in this system",
    ", we have a global conservation not only for the energy - as in case of the transverse ising model - but also for the transverse magnetization and , consequently , the effect of both the energy- and magnetization currents can be investigated .",
    "the xy chain is also interesting because it has power - law correlations already in the equilibrium state ( i.e. in the state without any current ) and so one might expect the system to be more sensitive to the introduction of currents .",
    "indeed , in case of the energy current we find a rather complex behavior ( including an increase of the ground - state symmetry at special values of the current ) and our findings for the steady state correlations are at variance with those for the transverse ising model . on the other hand ,",
    "the changes we observe in the correlations due to a magnetization current allow for a straightforward interpretation in terms of increasing correlations due to presence of a current .",
    "the effects of magnetization current are treated exactly ( sec.ii ) while the correlations in the presence of an energy current are calculated by a combination of analytical and exact numerical methods in sec.iii .",
    "summary and final comments are contained in sec.iv .",
    "our starting point is the hamiltonian of the @xmath5 isotropic xy model in a transverse field @xmath6 : @xmath7 where the spins are represented by pauli spin matrices @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) at sites @xmath10 of a one - dimensional periodic chain ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the transverse field , @xmath6 , is measured in units of the ising coupling , @xmath12 , which is set to @xmath13 throughout this paper .",
    "this model can be solved exactly @xcite since it can be transformed by a jordan - wigner transformation into a set of free fermions with wavenumber @xmath14 and of energy _",
    "k = -k - h. [ spec ]    in this model , not only the total energy but also the @xmath15 component of the total magnetization @xmath16 is conserved . as a result",
    ", one can write down a continuity equation for the local magnetization @xmath17 : _ ^z = i[h^xy , s_^z ] = j^m _ - j^m_-1 and this defines the magnetization current through the bonds : @xmath18 a macroscopic current can now be defined as j^m=_=1^n j^m _ and one can recognize @xmath19 as the hamiltonian of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the same expression emerged as the energy current in the case of the transverse ising model @xcite .    our aim is to find the lowest energy state among the states carrying a given current . since @xmath20=0 $ ]",
    ", the problem can be solved using the lagrange multiplier method , i.e.   we diagonalize the following hamiltonian : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the ground state of @xmath23 can be considered as a current  carrying steady state of @xmath24 at zero temperature .",
    "note that , without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ".    the hamiltonian @xmath23 is diagonalized using the same transformations which diagonalize @xmath24 , and we get the following spectrum in the thermodynamic limit : _ k =  , [ newspec ] where @xmath27 and an effective field @xmath28 has been introduced .",
    "one can see that the spectrum is similar to that of @xmath24 with the wavenumber shifted by @xmath29 .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the above result in not new .",
    "it is implicit in the bethe - ansatz solution of the anisotropic heisenberg chain with twisted toroidal boundary conditions @xcite and appears in various forms in studies of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction @xcite and of the associated berry phase @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath23 can be transformed into @xmath24 ( [ trxyhami ] ) using a unitary transformation : @xmath30 this transformation rotates the @xmath31th spin around the @xmath15 axis by angle @xmath32 and shifts the spectrum ( [ newspec ] ) by the wavenumber @xmath29 .",
    "this shift is analogous to the phase shift experienced by electrons on a ring threaded by a constant magnetic flux @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we also note that the ferro- and the anti - ferromagnetic cases are equivalent in the sense that the canonical transformation ( [ trans ] ) with @xmath34 transforms them into each other . for a finite periodic chain , @xmath23 is transformed to @xmath24 , but with a twisted boundary condition ( @xmath35",
    ".    as the transformation ( [ trans ] ) does not change the @xmath15 component of the spins , we find that s_^z = , and the correlation function ^z(r ) = s_^z s_+r^z= -^2have their equilibrium form but at a different field @xmath36 ( @xmath37 denotes the expectation value in the ground state of @xmath23 ) .",
    "one can see that , for @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , the spins are parallel to the field and there is no current in the system . for @xmath40 ( @xmath41 )",
    "the current has a simple form : @xmath42 and one can observe that the maximum current , reached in the limit of @xmath43 , is given by @xmath44 .",
    "the introduction of the transformation ( [ trans ] ) simplifies the calculation of the correlations @xmath45 in the ground state of @xmath23 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ground state of @xmath48 , while @xmath49 is that of @xmath24 at a field @xmath50 . without any current , we have @xmath51 and , furthermore ,",
    "the @xmath52 behavior of the @xmath53 correlation function @xcite is given by ^x(r ; j^m=0 ) ( 1-h^2 ) ^1/4 c  , [ eqrhox ] where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the glaisher s constant ) . using ( [ crosscorr ] )",
    ", one can obtain then the following simple form in the @xmath52 limit ^x(r ) ( 1-^2 ) ^1/4 c  ( r ) .",
    "thus we find that the correlations decay by power law and they show oscillatory behavior in the current - carrying states .",
    "this is similar to what has been observed in the transverse ising model but there are some differences . in the ising case ,",
    "an exponential decay of correlations changes into a power - law form as the current is switched on . in the xy case ,",
    "on the other hand , one has power - law correlations already in the equilibrium state .",
    "the magnetization current does not change the power law and leaves its exponent intact as well .",
    "the increase of correlations appears as the increase in the amplitude of the power law ( note that @xmath56 ) .",
    "since the energy is a conserved quantity as well , one can investigate the effects of the energy current . the local energy ( the contribution of the @xmath31th spin to the total energy ) satisfies a continuity equation with the local energy current @xmath57 , and its sum over @xmath31 ( the total energy current ) has the form : j^e=_=1^n [ s_^z ( s_-1^y s_+1^x - s_-1^x s_+1^y ) + h ( s_^x s_+1^y - s_^y s_+1^x ) ] [ jeop ] one can easily show that @xmath58=0 $ ] , and diagonalizing the hamiltonian h^e = h^xy - j^e  , one obtains the lowest energy eigenstates of @xmath24 in the presence of a given @xmath59 .    using the standard transformations to fermions again , the spectrum is obtained as : _",
    "k = ( -k - h ) ( 1-k )  , [ spec2 ] and the modes with negative energy are occupied in the ground state of @xmath60 .",
    "although the @xmath61 symmetry of the spectrum is broken for @xmath62 , the ground state remains that of @xmath24 for @xmath63 and , accordingly , no energy current flows through the system .",
    "this rigidity of the ground state against @xmath22 is a consequence of the fact that the fermionic spectrum of @xmath60 has a product form ( [ spec2 ] ) , and the second factor is positive for @xmath64 .",
    "the first and second factors in @xmath65 change sign at @xmath66 ( for @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 ) , respectively .",
    "the ` critical momenta ' @xmath70 and @xmath71 are defined here such that they take values @xmath72 and one has @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "one can study the ground state as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath22 , but we are more interested in the physical quantities as functions of @xmath6 and @xmath75 . thus first we calculate @xmath76 : j^e=\\ {    ll ( 1+h^2-^-2 )   & & & & 0 & ,    . [ je ] and than express all the @xmath22 dependences in terms of @xmath76 .",
    "we can then obtain a @xmath77 phase diagram as shown on fig.[hjfig ] where the phases  discussed below in more detail  are distinguished by symmetries of the regions of occupied states in the @xmath14-space .",
    "let us begin the analysis of the phase diagram by first describing it in terms of the behavior of currents and of the transverse magnetization . as shown in fig.[hjfig",
    "] , there is a maximal current for every value of @xmath6 j^e_max = \\ {    ll ( 1+h^2)/(2 ) & h1  , h/ & h1  ,    .",
    "and no state exists above @xmath78 .",
    "= 8truecm    we can divide the @xmath6@xmath76 phase diagram into three regions .",
    "the only interesting areas are and and their boundaries . in region , the ground state is the same along the @xmath79 lines ( @xmath80 ) thus the @xmath81 line contains all the information about this region .",
    "below , we restrict the discussion to the @xmath67 part of the phase diagram with the understanding that the @xmath81 line represents region .    as can be seen from ( [ jeop ] ) , the energy current has two parts : the term containing @xmath6 is proportional to the magnetization current ( @xmath82 ) while the other term is the current of the interaction energy .",
    "the distinguishing features of regions and are that the current of interaction energy is zero @xcite while the transverse magnetization , @xmath83 , is nonzero in the ground state .    for any fixed value of @xmath6 ,",
    "the magnetization decreases with increasing @xmath76 and @xmath83 becomes zero on the line @xmath84 corresponding to @xmath85 . on this line , the magnetization - current part of @xmath76 saturates and , upon increasing @xmath76",
    ", we enter region where the interaction part of the current starts to flow . another characteristic feature of region is that @xmath86 throughout this region .",
    "one tends to conclude at this point that the line separating regions and is a line of second order , nonequilibrium phase transitions with @xmath83 being the order parameter .",
    "this notion is also supported by the facts that several quantities such as @xmath87 and @xmath88 have a jump in their first derivatives when crossing the transition line and , furthermore , that the correlations are enhanced ( change from @xmath89 to @xmath90 ) on this line ( see sec.[sec : corr ] ) . if this was a phase transition , however , it was certainly a transition not in the usual sense .",
    "the symmetry of the ground state is the same on both sides of the transition line and the @xmath86 result in region is not a consequence of the up - down symmetry of the ground state .",
    "the magnetization is zero in because the motion of the zeros of the dispersion relation ( [ spec2 ] ) conspire to keep the ground state at half - filling .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the half - filling does not mean that the ground state has a symmetry with respect to global spin - flip @xmath91 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the symmetry of the ground state is higher on the transition line than on either side of it . indeed , on this `",
    "high'-symmetry line , the ground state is symmetric with respect to rotation of the spins around the @xmath92 axis by @xmath93 , followed by a spatial reflection mapping site @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath24 , has no such symmetry and , off the transition line , the ground state does nt have such symmetry either .",
    "thus we can see here an example where the increase of current in a system leads , at a particular value of the current , to symmetry enhancement .",
    "the reason for increase of symmetry is obviously some level crossing coming from the interplay of the current operator and the original hamiltonian .",
    "one might speculate that the occurance of such symmetry enhancements is not an accidental but a general feature of current carrying systems .",
    "the @xmath96 correlations can be calculated easily and , just as in the equilibrium case , one finds @xmath97 .",
    "the difference from the equilibrium is that the oscillatory modulation of the @xmath98 decay ( present in equilibrium for @xmath99 ) becomes more complex .",
    "such modulation has been observed in case of the imposed magnetic current ( see sec.[sec : mag ] ) as well as in the transverse ising model with energy current @xcite .",
    "the exponent of the power law decay , however , is unchanged when the currents are introduced in all of the above examples .",
    "thus it seems that @xmath96 correlations are not too sensitive to the presence of currents .",
    "a possible reason for this apparent rigidity is , perhaps , the lack of internal interactions among the @xmath15-components of the spins .",
    "it is harder to calculate the @xmath100 correlations but they show a more interesting behavior .",
    "some of our results described below are exact and were derived by combining the wick theorem and the spin rotation transformation ( [ trans ] ) which relates the correlation functions between states where the ground - state occupation pattern in @xmath14-space is identical up to shifts @xmath101 . as we shall see , these exact results are restricted to the boundaries of regions and . at a general point @xmath102",
    ", we were able to calculate @xmath103 numerically ( for @xmath104 lattice spacings ) using the fact that the square of the correlation can be expressed as a determinant of a @xmath105 matrix with exactly calculable elements .",
    "let us start by enumerating the exact results .",
    "the boundaries of region are discussed in points 1 - 3 while the boundaries of are treated in points 3 - 5 .    1 .",
    "as discussed in sec.[sec : mag ] , the correlations in the transverse xy model without current , i.e. on the line @xmath106 , are known @xcite and the @xmath107 asymptotics of @xmath108 is given by ^x(r;h , j^e=0)~c(1-h^2 ) ^1/4r^-1/2  .",
    "[ jzerobound ] 2 .",
    "the correlations on the @xmath81 line can be related to the equilibrium case @xmath106 and one finds : ^x(r;1,j^e ) = ^x(r;,0 ) ( r )  .",
    "[ exacth=1 ] thus , the large - distance behavior is given by ^x(r;1,j^e ) = cr^-1/2(r )  . since the whole phase can be projected onto the @xmath81 line , we find that correlations decay as @xmath90 for @xmath80 .",
    "the correlations on the ` high - symmetry ' line ( i.e on the boundary between and ) can also be related to equilibrium : @xmath109 so we find again a @xmath90 decay in the @xmath107 limit .",
    "4 .   on the line of maximal - current @xmath110 $ ]",
    ", the correlations can be expressed in terms of those on the line @xmath111 : ^x(r ; h , j^e_max)= ^x(r ; 0 , ) ( r )  . unfortunately",
    ", this does not help in calculating the @xmath107 behavior .",
    "the long range behavior of the correlations at the intersection point @xmath112 $ ] of the @xmath111 and the @xmath113 lines is also calculable : ^x(r ; 0 , ) = \\ { + ll 4 ^ 2~   & 0 & + .",
    "and it is remarkable that the correlation function in this point decays as @xmath114 instead of @xmath115 .",
    "the exact results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the @xmath116 correlations decay as @xmath115 on the boundaries of region while a @xmath114 decay can be observed in the upper - left corner @xmath112 $ ] of the phase diagram .",
    "numerical calculations suggest , however , that the @xmath114 asymptotics is more general than it looks from the exact results .",
    "there is a strong indication that the large - distance asymptotics is actually @xmath114 everywhere in region and apart from the boundaries of region .",
    "fig.[fitfig ] shows an example of numerical results at a general point of the phase diagram .",
    "the following formula gives an excellent fit to the numerical data throughout the phase diagram ( except very close to the lines with the @xmath115 behavior ) : ^x(r ) = \\ {    ll ( a_1(k_h r)+a_2(k_r))/r & ( a_3(k_h r)+a_2(k_r))/r  &    .",
    "[ bela ] the @xmath117 coefficients are functions of @xmath6 and @xmath76 , and for the phase @xmath118 seems to be valid .",
    "= 8truecm    as one can see from ( [ bela ] ) , the amplitude of the @xmath114 decay is modulated with the critical wavenumbers @xmath70 and @xmath71 . on the ` high - symmetry ' transition line we have @xmath84 and",
    "the transition across this line takes us from region where @xmath119 to region where @xmath120 .",
    "thus one can view the ` high - symmetry ' line as a line of degeneracy where two characteristic wavelengths of the system become equal .",
    "this transition may resemble transitions arising from competing wavelengths but , actually , here we do not have a competition between @xmath70 and @xmath71 . due to the product form of @xmath65 ,",
    "@xmath70 is independent of @xmath22 while @xmath71 is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , this transition does have similarities with second order transitions in that the correlations decay more slowly ( @xmath121 ) and , furthermore , one can observe scaling upon approach of the transition line . in order to see this , let us assume that the distance from the transition line , @xmath122 , provides the single diverging lengthscale which generates the @xmath121 crossover in correlations .",
    "then one should observe scaling when plotting the following ratio : = ( |k_h - k_| 2r )  , [ scale1 ] where @xmath123 is a point on the transition line and the @xmath124 limit is taken . note that the long range behavior of the denominator ( @xmath108 on the phase transition line ) is known ( [ bound ] ) . as one can see from fig.[scale1fig ] , the data collapse is excellent thus supporting the assumption of scaling ( [ scale1 ] ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    it is interesting to note that the scaling function appears to be the same on the both sides of the phase - transition line .",
    "furthermore , @xmath125 is independent of the crossing point @xmath123 unless we are close to the zero - field equilibrium point @xmath126 . in this sense",
    "we have the kind of universality usually observed in critical phase transitions .",
    "the equilibrium point @xmath126 is the endpoint of the ` high'-symmetry line . at this point ,",
    "the ground state symmetry is higher than on the line and so we may expect that , provided scaling was still present , the scaling function would be different .",
    "this is indeed what we observe .",
    "= 8.0 cm    approaching the point @xmath126 along the @xmath127 line , one has again a diverging lengthscale proportional to @xmath128 and one can search again for scaling in the correlation function = ( k_r )  .",
    "[ scale4 ] as shown in fig.[scale4fig ] , scaling is indeed seen and the scaling function is significantly different from that found away from the @xmath126 point .",
    "the numerical results presented above ( as well as other data gathered in our explorations of the phase diagram ) suggest strongly that @xmath129 for generic current - carrying states .",
    "slower decay , @xmath130 is observed only on the boundaries of region and the crossover between the @xmath114 and @xmath115 behaviors can be understood in terms of single - lengthscale scaling .",
    "it is intriguing that there is a simple correspondence between the types of decay of correlations and the `` band structure '' of the ground state .",
    "the lines of slower decay of correlations coincide with those lines where the ground state is build by a single band of excitations in momentum space , whereas in all regions of @xmath114-decay , the filling pattern of the ground state splits into two separate bands ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    regarding the interplay of currents and correlations these results leave us with the following conclusions .",
    "first , we find that the large - distance correlations are not necessarily increased by switching on a current .",
    "second , it is found that the equilibrium power - law correlations are not destroyed by the current , only the exponent in the power law is increased .",
    "this strengthens previous observations that currents and power - law correlations are intimately related .",
    "third , we find that the increase of current may lead to interesting phase - transition like behavior related to the _ increase of symmetry _ at special values of the current .",
    "a general conclusion we can draw from the present study of the transverse @xmath131 model and from comparison with the results on the transverse ising model @xcite is that currents appear to generate and maintain power - law correlations .",
    "an interesting feature of @xmath131 model which may also have some generality is the increase of the symmetry of the ground state at special values of the energy current .",
    "this feature should certainly be searched for in other models as well as in experiments .",
    "it should be recognized , however , that both the @xmath131 and the transverse ising models are integrable and , consequently , they are special in that conductivity and , in particular , the thermal conductivity is ideal for them ( not only at zero but also at nonzero temperatures ) .",
    "thus it is an important next step to find out whether nonintegrable models have the same connection between currents and power - law correlations and , furthermore , whether they show any additional general features .",
