    "excitonic molecules - or biexcitons - are known and well studied since several decades in conventional semiconductors .",
    "their formations due to the coupling of a pair of exciton and their photophysics properties have been well established both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the outstanding facts are related to the giant oscillator strength associated with the one exciton - biexciton transition ; we may cite , for instance , the giant two photon absorption , shown theoretically by hanamura @xcite and observed first on cucl by gale and mysyrowicz @xcite .",
    "there , five or six orders of magnitude more than for typical two - photon interband transitions are observed .    in organic compounds ,",
    "the interest for excitonic bound states - or excitonic complexes or last , to use a terminology coming from the bethe ansatz technique , excitonic strings - is rather new since the main studies started about five or six years ago .",
    "they concern three types of compounds : some organic charge transfer solids ( ct ) , _ j _ or _ h_-aggregates ( _ j - h_a ) and conjugated polymers ( cp ) .",
    "the organic ct solids considered here , consist of planar aromatic donor ( d ) and acceptor ( a ) molecules alternately arranged along a one - dimensional stack . a large distance between molecules of the same stack ( more than 3 @xmath0 )",
    "gives a rather small hopping integral compared to the characteristic coulomb repulsion .",
    "moreover , a very large distance between neighbouring chains ensures the quasi - one dimensionality of these systems .",
    "a prototype is given by the anthracene - pmda ( pyromellitic acid dianhydride ) ; for this compound , by comparison between theoretical calculations on small clusters and experimental results of differential transmission spectroscopies , the existence of biexcitons - and even triexcitons - has been demonstrated recently @xcite .",
    "this result stays , for the moment , the only clear evidence for excitonic strings in organic compounds .",
    "_ j _ and _ h_-aggregates are also , in many cases , one dimensional stacks of organic molecules .",
    "but , on the contrary to the previous class of compounds , they have no ionic character and the attractive exciton - exciton interaction is smaller .",
    "they are typical organic solids in the sense that their low - lying excitations can be understood in terms of frenkel excitons .",
    "these compounds are claimed to be the ideal ones to get biexcitons but , without convincing demonstration for the moment - possibly be due to a too small binding energy @xcite .",
    "conjugated polymers are very complex compounds .",
    "as far as we are concerned with low - lying excitations , we may consider them , at first approximation , as an one dimensional interacting electron gas , which strongly interacts with the lattice too @xcite .",
    "moreover , for a more realistic description , in many cases , three dimensional effects and inter- and intra - chain disorder should be considered .",
    "because of these difficulties , despite a large amount of work , even the nature of the primary excitations remains subject of intense controversies @xcite .",
    "anyway , some photoinduced absorption ( pa ) experiments @xcite and two photon absorption ( tpa ) experiments @xcite show some features which are possibly due to biexcitons .",
    "only a few theoretical investigations of excitonic strings in organic compounds have been done @xcite .",
    "most of them are based on exact diagonalizations of small clusters using different kinds of model hamiltonians depending on the system under consideration @xcite . from these results and based on physical reasoning , it has been argued that , when biexcitonic states exist , the intensity of the optical one exciton - biexciton transition may decrease when the binding energy of the biexciton increases ; moreover , this intensity is shown to be less important than the one of the one exciton - two excitons ( two free excitons ) transitions and , even , is supposed to be independent of the system size for sufficiently large binding energies @xcite . therefore , if the tendencies observed on finite clusters remain the same for the infinite system , on the contrary to the situation observed in some inorganic semiconductors @xcite , it may be difficult to create biexcitons by tpa",
    ". a more appropriated experimental technique to observe excitonic strings would then be the differential transmission spectroscopy used by the way in @xcite . throughout this manuscript",
    ", we often refer to these numerical works for comparisons , especially concerning the intensity of the transition from one exciton to biexciton states .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a model for studying excitonic complexes in organic compounds . based on physical arguments ,",
    "we think , this model is relevant for the three classes of compounds enumerated above . for organic crystals ,",
    "as the @xmath1 and @xmath2 aggregates , our model is equivalent , in the low energy sector , to an effective _ xxz _ spin one - half heisenberg model already used to study this problem @xcite . for the ct solids and cp",
    ", some extensions are necessary because the proper excitons are not of frenkel type .",
    "they are realized by introducing effective hard core boson particles with a finite extension on a lattice , which mimics the exciton extension .",
    "next , we propose an effective hamiltonian in terms of these particles which captures the essential physical ingredients to describe excitonic strings in organic compounds .",
    "this model is considerably easier to study than the traditionally employed models and therefore some analytical investigations are possible . in this paper , we study the proposed model for two and three particles in a finite and infinite lattice .",
    "our main interests concern the behaviours of the binding energies of the excitonic strings with the parameters of the model and of the one exciton - biexciton transition oscillator strengths ; are they giant as in inorganic semiconductors or , on the contrary , small as suggested by exact diagonalizations on small clusters @xcite ?",
    "this question is crucial in order to clarify the role of hypothetical biexcitons - or even more extended excitonic strings - in the photophysics of organic compounds .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section",
    "ii , we introduce our hard core boson hamiltonian . in section iii ,",
    "iv and v , we study this hamiltonian for one , two and three particles respectively .",
    "first , for each class of systems mentioned in this study , we emphasize the main characteristics which are important for our purpose .",
    "_ j _ and _ h _ aggregates are typical organic crystals . the ground state of these systems is the tensorial product of the molecular ground states .",
    "the low - lying excitations are frenkel - type excitons where the hole and the electron of a monoexcitation are located on the same molecular site @xcite .",
    "we can draw a picture of these excitations in the following way : if we represent symbolically the ground state of such a quasi - one dimensional system as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 stands for a molecule in its ground state , the frenkel excitons are the bloch states of local configurations such as @xmath5 where the superscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 are for the electron and the hole , respectively ; @xmath8 is then a monoexcited molecule .",
    "organic ct solids are stacks of donor ( d ) and acceptor ( a ) molecules .",
    "we already mentioned that they are , with a good approximation , quasi - one dimensional systems with a nearest - neighbour hopping term small compared to the coulombic term .",
    "the strong coupling regime is then a good starting point to consider such systems .",
    "moreover , if one consider only a short range coulombic term , their ground state would be a charge density wave depicted roughly by the unique configuration @xmath9 where d molecules get two electrons and a molecules none .",
    "the low - lying excitations would then be the excitons where an electron is transfered from a d to an a molecule ; they would be bloch states of excited configurations such as @xmath10 ( more details could be found in ref @xcite ) .",
    "we get a so - called charge transfer exciton ( cte ) . for a more realistic coulomb potential ,",
    "the picture proposed above will remain reasonable , at first approximation .",
    "conjugated polymers are quite different from the other systems just considered since , obviously , they are not molecular crystals . on the contrary ,",
    "they are usually described as an one dimensional electron gas governed by the pariser - parr - pople ( ppp ) hamiltonian which includes both long range coulomb interaction and , semi - classically , electron - phonon interaction @xcite .",
    "numerical studies of this hamiltonian give , for a proper choice of parameters , excitonic states of small radius , typically a few monomeric units @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the ground state may be analyzed in terms of basis sets completely localized on the monomers .",
    "then , the ground state of finite clusters is shown to contain mainly intermonomer charge fluctuations of very short range - especially the nearest - neighbours ones @xcite . according to these specificities ,",
    "an effective model has been proposed very recently @xcite .",
    "starting from the ppp hamiltonian , this model reaches a kind of molecular - crystal description for the low - lying excitations in conjugated polymers . in this new approach the vacuum ( or ground state ) is still not the simple molecular - type of ground state , proper to the simpson related models @xcite , but a matrix - product like state composed by local configurations extended at most , over two monomers .",
    "excitons are then composed mainly by local configurations where either the electron and the hole are localized on the same monomer or distant by only one monomer ; the weight of the configurations where the electron and the hole are more separated decreases exponentially in the wave functions . therefore , the radius of the exciton , @xmath11 , defined as an average distance between the hole and the electron is rather small .",
    "if we assume @xmath12 , the following pictorial representation can be done : if we represent the ground state as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a monomer , the excitons will be the bloch states of such configurations @xmath13 .",
    "because of the electron - hole symmetry , the charge transfer of the electron on the right side and on the left side must be combined either symmetrically or antisymmetrically .",
    "in contrast to the two previous cases , excitons have here , a structure .    in conclusion , in these three cases , excitons are bloch states of very localized excitations .",
    "the vacuum and the nature of these local excitations vary , of course , following the system under consideration : crystal molecular ground state and frenkel excitons for @xmath1 and @xmath2 aggregates , cdw and cte for ct solids and finally , matrix - product state and some kind of cte but including the two possible arrangements of the charges , for cp .",
    "however , all these very localized excitations can be thought in terms of effective hard core bosons ( hcb ) extended over a few bonds - with an extension of the order of the exciton s radius .",
    "we adopt such a view in this work , and describe the dynamics of these excitations within the same model which we introduce now .    in this study",
    ", we consider only one dimensional lattices with n sites , a site being a molecular - site in the case of molecular crystals@xcite and a monomer - site in the case of cp @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , this is a good approximation for a large class of compounds studied here .",
    "however , the generalization to higher dimensions should be possible and the subject of further studies .",
    "excitons are extended over @xmath11 sites , the radius of the excitons , which varies from zero to a few units in the cases considered here . in this study , to mimic the excitons , we introduce hcb particles extended over one bond ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this minimal extension is adopted more by a pictorial preoccupation but , also , in accordance with the work developed in ref @xcite .",
    "indeed , at the thermodynamic limit where we will derive all the analytical formulae , this extension plays obviously no role , since it remains small compared to the system size .",
    "moreover , for finite size cluster calculations , the qualitative behaviours shown in this paper could also be obtained by choosing @xmath14 , @xmath15 or even other small @xmath11 . the restriction to @xmath12 does not affect the conclusions but , if necessary , more ( or less ) extended particles could also be considered without any difficulties . working with extended particles , instead of particles localized on a site ,",
    "does not imply technical complications .",
    "the coulomb interaction between excitons must be included in order to describe excitonic strings .",
    "for that purpose , the relative position between the electron and the hole , the two elementary constituents of an exciton , becomes important .",
    "we introduce then two species of hcb extended over one bond :    * the so - called right - bosons ( @xmath16 ) which mimic nearest neighbour electron - hole pairs with the electron on the right ( see figure [ rlbosons].a ) . * the so - called left - bosons ( @xmath17 ) which also mimic nearest neighbour electron - hole pairs but with the electron on the left ( see figure [ rlbosons].b ) .    the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles obey the following hamiltonian    @xmath18    @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the destruction ( creation ) operators of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons at site @xmath21 , @xmath22 , the operators number of hcb @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) at site @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath23 is the excitonic energy ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the @xmath1 term is the hopping term of the hcb ( @xmath25 ) ; it is directly related to the exciton band width given by @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is an effective term for virtual interactions which couple locally @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles are effective representations of more complex particles , invoking a more sophisticated level of description ; these `` high level '' particles possess a structure which can be very complicated as it is the case for most of the cp .",
    "the interaction @xmath27 reflects the existence of virtual processes exchanging the relative position of the electron and the hole of an exciton ; this can be due , for instance , to kinetic terms .",
    "indeed , by a second order process involving a n.n . hopping term , it is readily possible to exchange the relative position of the two building particles of an exciton .",
    "the last term of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , is the interaction between excitons restricted to nearest - neighbours .",
    "we have to distinguish between two situations : for two excitons of the same species , @xmath31 or @xmath32 , the nearest charges are of opposite sign so that the resulting interaction must be attractive ; the situation is reversed for two excitons of opposite species , @xmath33 or @xmath34 , where the resulting interaction is repulsive .    for structureless excitons , frenkel or ct - excitons , the definition of two species of degenerate hcb makes no sense . to study strings of such excitons with the general hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , it is sufficient to : ( i ) identify the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles and ( ii ) to take the limit @xmath35 . to be more precise",
    ", @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles may exist in the case of ct solids , but with a large energy difference which results , in our model , in a very small @xmath27 ; therefore , it is a good approximation to simply neglect this term in this case .    in the following , we will study the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for one , two and three particles , which are the cases of experimental interest .",
    "excitons appear as bloch states of symmetric or antisymmetric combinations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons , corresponding to two different symmetry classes    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the state without any boson .",
    "the separation in energy between this two states is given by @xmath38 , the @xmath39 state being lower .",
    "in the case of _ j _ ( _ h _ ) aggregates and ct solids , we identify @xmath16 and @xmath17 bosons and get only one excitonic state @xmath40    in all cases , exciton states result in a very intense peak in the linear absorption spectrum for @xmath41 , while the electron - hole continuum is almost not visible .",
    "this very unusual feature , if we think about conventional semiconductors , is an important characteristic of these one dimensional compounds @xcite .",
    "this is easily understandable since the radius of the exciton is very small and the ground state contains mainly short range charge fluctuations @xcite .",
    "now , we write down the elementary transition moments due to a localized hcb , @xmath42 , in the case of cp and @xmath43 , in the case of _ j _ ( _ h _ ) aggregates and ct solids ( @xmath44 is for organic crystal ) ; these quantities will serve in the following to express the transition moments between one exciton and two exciton states    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the charge of the electron and @xmath47 the position operator .",
    "the intensity of the ground state - one exciton transition at @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath48 or @xmath49 , depending on the system under consideration @xcite . in the case of cp",
    ", only the excitonic state @xmath50 is observable in linear absorption .",
    "however , the state @xmath51 could become important , as it is the case in electroabsorption experiments for instance .",
    "the wave functions with two excitons are written as @xmath52where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are @xmath16 or @xmath17 bosons , @xmath55 the ket relative to the situation where the particle @xmath53 is in @xmath56 and @xmath54 in @xmath57 with @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the corresponding amplitude .    as usual",
    ", we treat separately the movement of the center of mass and of the relative position of the two particles .",

    "both of these behaviours depict inverse mechanisms than the ones theoretically predicted for the ground state - one exciton transition @xcite , where the intensity of the excitonic peak is proportional to the size of the system and increases with the binding energy .",
    "these behaviours are illustrated in figure [ intensity ] where the equation ( [ momentn ] ) is evaluated for @xmath133 .",
    "there , we see that the intensity of the one exciton - biexciton transition decreases dramatically when @xmath123 decreases ( which means , when the binding energy increases ) reaching saturation for small @xmath123 . then , this intensity is independent of @xmath130 which gives in pa and tpa spectroscopy an intensity proportional to @xmath134 instead of @xmath130 for the transition to the continuum of two free excitons ; this last behaviour can be seen by comparison with equation ( [ momentthermo ] ) evaluated at the large @xmath130 limit ( dashed line ) .",
    "consequently , at the thermodynamic limit , biexcitons may be observable by spectroscopy experiments , but with the need of very clean compounds , otherwise we may expect at first analyse , that the intense transition to two free excitons would not permit to detect possible biexcitons . within our model , no two - photon giant resonance @xcite can be expected for @xmath1 , @xmath2 aggregates and organic charge transfer solids .",

    "the question we want to address more specifically here is how the @xmath27 term will affect the binding energy , the wave function and the transition moment related to the biexcitons .",
    "for @xmath136 , from equations ( [ impurities ] ) and ( [ pbc ] ) , we get at the thermodynamic limit the following set of equations    @xmath137    from equations ( [ energie ] ) and the second equation of ( [ set2 ] ) , we get @xmath138where @xmath105 and @xmath139 .",
    "this expression together with equations ( [ energie ] ) , gives the energy of the lowest biexciton .",
    "the binding energy of the biexciton , @xmath140 , is then given by the following equation @xmath141\\]]the study of this expression shows that the biexciton binding energy decreases when @xmath27 increases ( see figure [ bindingenergy ] ) .",
    "this behaviour is not surprising since the @xmath27 term mixed together @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles ; by doing so , configurations with two unlike particles , @xmath33 or @xmath34 , appear in the wave function which increase its energy and then reduce the binding energy with respect to the case for @xmath142 .",
    "the critical value @xmath143 for which the binding energy becomes zero is given by the solution of the equation @xmath144 ,    @xmath145    the critical value , @xmath143 , increases when @xmath123 decreases , to diverge for @xmath146 : for a very large binding energy , @xmath27 has no effect on the bound states anymore .",
    "another interesting quantity along this critical line , is the critical value @xmath147",
    "@xmath148    from this equation , we can see without any surprise , than @xmath147 - the critical value above which one gets biexcitonic states - continuously increases when @xmath149 increases .",

    "the previous result is recovered . for @xmath158 ,",
    "the weight of the @xmath77 component decreases smoothly in the wave function .",
    "consequently , the a priori unfavourable configurations @xmath33 or @xmath34 appear in the biexciton wave function , on the contrary to the previous case without the @xmath27 interaction .",
    "the transition moment of the one exciton - biexciton transition at @xmath96 can be easily calculated with the expression of the wave function ( [ wf2 ] ) , but contains no new information compared to what was already pointed out for @xmath35 .",
    "the results obtained in the previous subsection remain valid in this case .",
    "the only difference comes from the fact that the @xmath77 component is non active in linear absorption .",
    "consequently , for the same binding energy , if we assume @xmath159 , the biexcitonic peak would be a bit more intense for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) aggregates or ct solids than for cp .",
    "for instance , for @xmath35 , we get @xmath160 ; for @xmath158 , the @xmath76 becomes more important than the @xmath77 component in the wave function : the intensity of the one exciton - biexciton transition then increases .",

    "again , a 3-string is found with a binding energy larger than the one for the biexciton .",
    "we also found a critical value for @xmath27 , larger than the @xmath143 valid for the 2-strings .    from numerical studies on small clusters @xcite",
    ", it has been argued that _",
    "n_-strings may exist for any value of _ n _ in organic compounds .",
    "our work gives some confidence to this statement .",
    "indeed , with our hcb hamiltonian , if biexcitons exist , triexcitons will exist with a larger binding energy ; moreover , if @xmath35 , _ n_-strings will also exist with binding energies which increase with _",
    "n _ and , we believe , from our present results , that it will also be the case for @xmath100",
    ".    the next important question concerning the _ n_-string peaks in pa and tpa experiments , is fully clarified for the biexciton ( the most important case ) and confirms some conclusions of previous works @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the transition from the one exciton to the biexciton decreases with the binding energy and , for sufficient binding energy , becomes independent of the system size .",
    "hence , the pa intensity to the biexciton is proportional to @xmath134 instead of @xmath130 for the two free exciton case .",
    "this property comes from the fact that the two excitons are tightly bounded within the complex , rendering the 2-string states difficult to observe for infinite systems ( clean samples are needed ) and more accessible experimentally for small oligomers @xcite .    in the case of conjugated polymers ,",
    "we think some additional studies are needed going in two different directions .",
    "first , in the context of pa experiments , excitations extended over two molecules have been invoked @xcite ; extension of our work to two dimensions or , at least , for two coupled polymers would be suitable .",
    "second , conjugated polymers are disordered systems with several possible sources of disorder which result , in practice , in the vague definition of the so - called conjugation length @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned , since the transitions to biexcitons are much less intense than the ones involving two free excitons , we may expect at first analyse - and it was implicitly our point of view all along this manuscript - that a sufficient disorder will render the biexcitons not observable .",
    "however , some relatively recent results about the two interacting particle problem in a disordered medium @xcite show very unexpected behaviours which may have dramatic consequences for our problem , and possibly in a way reverse to our intuition . in the light of the intriguing results of @xcite ,",
    "the effects of disorder on transition moments should be clarified for a correct interpretation of pa and tpa results .",
    "we leave these considerations to further works .",
    "i would like to thank prof .",
    "ovchinnikov for his support and illuminating discussions .",
