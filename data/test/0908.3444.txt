    "in this paper , we study the behavior of different physical quantities at the resonances generated by the maximum of the potential of a semiclassical schrdinger operator .",
    "in particular , we show quantitatively to what extent the presence of these resonances drives the behavior of the scattering amplitude and of the schrdinger group .",
    "the resonances generated by the maximum point of the potential ( usually called barrier - top resonances ) have been studied by briet , combes and duclos @xcite and sjstrand @xcite .",
    "these authors have given a precise description of the resonances in any disc of size @xmath0 centered at the maximum of the potential .",
    "in particular , they have shown that the resonances lie at distance of order @xmath0 from the real axis , which is in very strong contrast to the case of shape resonances ( the well in the island case ) , with exponentially small imaginary part ( see helffer and sjstrand @xcite ) .",
    "the description of resonances in larger discs of size @xmath1 , @xmath20,1]$ ] has been obtained by kaidi and kerdelhu @xcite under a diophantine condition . for small discs of size one",
    ", this question has been treated in the one dimensional case by the third author @xcite with the complex wkb method . in the two dimensional case ,",
    "the resonances in discs of size one have also been considered by hitrik , sjstrand and v ngc @xcite ( see also the references in this paper ) . here",
    ", we consider only the resonances at distance @xmath0 of the maximum of the potential and we recall their precise localization in section  [ k5 ] .    resonances can be defined as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the cut - off resolvent ( see e.g. hunziker @xcite ) . the generalized spectral projection associated to a resonance",
    "is defined as the residue of the resolvent at this pole : @xmath3 as an operator from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 were an isolated eigenvalue , this formula would give the usual spectral projection .",
    "many physical quantities can be expressed in terms of these generalized spectral projections . in the case of shape resonances ,",
    "their semiclassical expansion has been computed by helffer and sjstrand in @xcite . in section [ a1 ] below , we obtain the semiclassical expansion of the generalized spectral projection for barrier - top resonances .",
    "since the resonances in the present case have a much larger imaginary part , our result is very different from that of the shape resonance case .",
    "resonances appear also in scattering theory ( they are called scattering poles in this context ) . in @xcite , lax and phillips have shown that they coincide with the poles of the meromorphic extension of the scattering amplitude .",
    "this result , proved for the wave equation in the exterior of a compact obstacle , was extended by grard and martinez @xcite to the long range case for the schrdinger equation ( see also the references in this paper for earlier works ) . for shape resonances ,",
    "the residue of the scattering amplitude was calculated in the semiclassical limit by nakamura @xcite , lahmar - benbernou @xcite and lahmar - benbernou and martinez @xcite .",
    "more generally , upper bounds on the residues of the scattering amplitude have been obtained by stefanov @xcite ( in the compact support case ) and michel @xcite ( in the long range case ) for resonances very close to the real axis . in section [ k2 ] ,",
    "we give the semiclassical expansion of the residues of the scattering amplitude for barrier - top resonances and we will see that these upper bounds do not hold in the present setting .",
    "it is commonly believed that resonances play also a crucial role in quantum dynamics .",
    "indeed , it is sometimes possible to describe the long time evolution of the cut - off propagator ( for example , the schrdinger or wave group ) in term of the resonances .",
    "typically , if the resonances are simple , the propagator @xmath7 truncated by @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the generalized spectral projection defined previously .",
    "such a formula generalizes the poisson formula , valid for the operators with discrete spectrum .",
    "the resonance expansion of the wave group was first obtained by lax and phillips @xcite in the exterior of a star - shaped obstacle .",
    "this result has been generalized , using various techniques , to different non trapping situations ( see e.g. vanberg @xcite and the references of the second edition of the book @xcite ) .",
    "the trapping situations have been treated by tang and zworski @xcite and burq and zworski @xcite for very large times . on the other hand , the time evolution of the quasiresonant states ( sorts of quasimodes ) has been studied by grard and sigal @xcite .",
    "a specific study of the schrdinger group for the shape resonances created by a well in a island has been made by nakamura , stefanov and zworski @xcite .",
    "there are also some works concerning the situation of a hyperbolic trapped set .",
    "we refer to the work of christiansen and zworski @xcite for the wave equation on the modular surface and on the hyperbolic cylinder , and to the work of guillarmou and naud @xcite for the wave equation on convex co - compact hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "section [ k3 ] is devoted to the computation of the asymptotic behavior for large time of the schrdinger group localized in energies close to the maximum of the potential .    for the proof of the different results of this paper , we use an estimate of the distorted resolvent around the resonances , polynomial with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , such a bound allows to apply the semiclassical microlocal calculus .",
    "this estimate is established in section  [ k4 ] . to prove it",
    ", we proceed as in @xcite and use the method developed by martinez @xcite , sjstrand @xcite and tang and zworski @xcite .",
    "similar bounds around the resonances are already known in various situations ( see e.g. grard @xcite for two strictly convex obstacles , michel and the first author @xcite in the one dimensional case ) . note that , in our setting , a limiting absorption principle have been proved in @xcite .",
