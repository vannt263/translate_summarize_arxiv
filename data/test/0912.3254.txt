    "when ordered magnets are exposed to microwave radiation of sufficiently high power , one typically observes an exponential growth of the population of certain groups of spin - wave modes during some intermediate time interval .",
    "this is an example for a general phenomenon which is usually referred to as _ parametric resonance_. a particularly suitable system for observing parametric resonance are yttrium - iron garnet ( yig ) crystals , because the spin - waves in this system have a very low damping @xcite .",
    "early microscopic theories explaining parametric resonance in magnetic insulators have been developed by suhl@xcite , and by schlmann and co - authors @xcite . in the 1970s zakharov ,",
    "lvov , and starobinets @xcite developed a comprehensive kinetic theory of parametric resonance in magnon gases which is sometimes called `` s - theory '' . in this approach kinetic equations for the time - dependent distribution functions @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are derived within the self - consistent time - dependent hartree - fock approximation .",
    "here @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the annihilation and creation operators of magnons with momentum @xmath4 in the heisenberg picture .",
    "subsequently the non - linear kinetic equations of the `` s - theory '' and extensions thereof have been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "quite recently demokritov and co - workers @xcite observed a new coherence effect of magnons in yig under the influence of an external microwave field which they interpreted as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons at room temperature .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed in superfluid @xmath5he , where nmr pumping can cause the magnetization to precess phase - coherently @xcite .",
    "the emergence of this coherent state can also be viewed as magnon bec @xcite .",
    "whether or not the experiments by demokritov _",
    "@xcite can be considered to be an analogue of bec in atomic bose gases ( which nowadays is routinely realized using ultracold atoms in an optical trap ) has been discussed controversially in the literature @xcite .",
    "we argue below that the coherent state generated in these experiments @xcite should perhaps not be called a bose - einstein condensate , because the condensation is not accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking in this case ; instead , the microwave field gives rise to a term in the hamiltonian which explicitly breaks the @xmath6-symmetry of the magnon hamiltonian .",
    "unfortunately , the conventional `` s - theory '' is insufficient to describe the experimental situation , because the coherent magnon state generated in the experiments is characterized by finite expectation values of the magnon annihilation and creation operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 for certain special values of @xmath4 . in the condensed phase , the kinetic equations for the pair correlators @xmath9 and @xmath10 should therefore be augmented by equations of motion for the expectation values @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "recall that in the theory of the interacting bose gas the corresponding equation of motion for the order - parameter is called gross - pitaevskii equation ;  @xcite this equation is missing in the conventional `` s - theory '' which therefore does not completely describe the coherent magnon state in the regime of strong pumping . in this work",
    "we shall outline an extension of `` s - theory '' which includes the order parameter dynamics on equal footing with the kinetic equations for the distribution functions . since we would like to clarify conceptual points rather than performing explicit quantitative calculations",
    ", we shall derive our extended `` s - theory '' within the framework of a simple toy model which we motivate in the following section .",
    "in order to understand a complex physical phenomenon , it is sometimes useful to study a simplified `` toy model '' which still contains some essential features of the phenomenon of interest . for our purpose , it is sufficient to consider a single anharmonic oscillator with an additional time - dependent term describing the creation and annihilation of pairs of particles .",

    "our toy model ( [ eq : htoy ] ) involves only a single boson operator representing the magnon at the minimum of the dispersion which is expected to condense .",

    ", we should therefore generalize our extended `` s - theory '' to include all magnon modes relevant to the experiments on yig .",
    "this would also allow us to distinguish between the `` primary magnons '' created by the external pumping , and the `` condensing magnons '' with wave - vectors at the minima of the dispersion .",
