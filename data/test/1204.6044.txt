    "modified theories of gravity ( mg ) have received a lot of attention in recent years . several unexplained phenomena such as the observed accelerated expansion of the universe , spatio - temporal variation of the fundamental constants ( e.g. the fine - structure constant ) and dark matter can in principle",
    "be explained by modifying general relativity ( gr ) on large ( astrophysical and greater ) scales .",
    "this study is motivated by recent work on mg to obtain cosmic acceleration without invoking quintessence - like dark energy . even on theoretical grounds ,",
    "gr is unlikely to be the complete theory of gravity owing to singularities and its non - renormalizibility .",
    "hence it is generally considered to be the low energy effective action of some uv - complete theory ( though our interest is modifications in the long distance / low energy regime ) .",
    "any modification to gr generically introduces an additional degree of freedom ( weinberg 1965 ) and scalar - tensor theories , where a new scalar field couples non - minimally to gravity , are ubiquitous in many attempts to find consistent theories .",
    "theories of higher dimensional gravity often appear as scalar - tensor theories to observers in four dimensions .",
    "theories such as dgp ( dvali , gabadadze & porrati 2000 ) invoke braneworld scenarios  the distance between two branes acts as the scalar field . in kaluza - klein models ,",
    "the parameters controlling the size of the compact directions appear as a scalar coupled to gravity in four dimensions .",
    "the low energy effective action of string theory contains a new scalar particle , the dilaton , coupled non - minimally to gravity and any theory with @xmath3 supergravity ( or higher ) contains at least two scalar fields in the gravity multiplet .",
    "even attempts to modify the geometrical properties of gr tend to lead to scalar - tensor theories ; for example the entire class of @xmath0 theories is equivalent to a single scalar field coupled non - minimally to matter via a weyl rescaling of the metric .",
    "thus a wide class of gravity theories contain a coupling of the scalar field to matter via a universal fifth force which leads to enhancements of the gravitational force .",
    "non - relativistic matter  such as the stars , gas , and dust in galaxies  will feel this enhanced force and as a consequence , a general feature of scalar - tensor theories is that dynamically inferred masses are larger than the true masses",
    ". the discrepancy can be up to a factor of @xmath4 in @xmath0 or dgp gravity ( for recent reviews see silvestri & trodden 2009 and jain & khoury 2010 ) .",
    "photons do not feel the enhanced force , so that lensing probes the true mass distribution .",
    "this enhanced gravitational force should be detectable through fifth force searches such as the et - wash experiment ( kapner et al .",
    "2007 ) and casimir force experiments ( e.g. decca et al 2003 ) as well as tests of the equivalence principle ( mota & shaw 2006 ) or through the orbits of planets around the sun ( will 2006 ) . however , since all of these experiments have been performed in our local vicinity , i.e. the solar system , they do not rule out any large - scale modifications where fifth forces are active over large ( cosmological ) scales while matching the predictions of gr within experimental bounds on small scales .",
    "any theory where the fifth forces are suppressed on small scales is said to possess a _ screening mechanism _ :",
    "regions where fifth forces are active are said to be _ unscreened _ whereas those where they are suppressed are _",
    "khoury & weltman ( 2004 ) proposed such a mechanism where non - linear screening of the scalar field , known as _ chameleon screening _ , can suppress the fifth force in high density environments such as the milky way , so that solar system and laboratory tests can be satisfied .",
    "in this paper we will consider deviations from gr exhibited in theories that rely on chameleon screening .",
    "qualitatively similar behavior occurs in symmetron screening ( hinterbichler & khoury 2010 ) and the environmentally dependent dilaton ( brax et al .",
    "2010 ) and the tests we will present here apply to these mechanisms as well we also note that chameleon screening was originally suggested to hide the effects of a quintessence - like scalar that forms the dark energy and may couple to matter ( generically such a coupling is expected unless forbidden by a symmetry ) . hence there are reasons to expect such a screening effect to operate in either a dark energy or modified gravity scenario , or even in scenarios that do nt relate to cosmic acceleration such as the scalar fields invoked in string theories .    a different screening mechanism , vainshtein screening ( vainshtein 1972 ) , operates by including non - canonical kinetic terms in the field equations whose non - linear nature acts to recover gr on scales smaller than some _",
    "vainshtein radius_. in theories that contain this mechanism ( such as dgp , massive gravity and galileons ) this radius must typically be taken to be of the order of the length scale of typical galaxies , independent of their mass , and so does not produce the observable effects considered here ( see appleby and linder 2012 for recent cosmological constraints for a subclass of galileon theories ) .",
    "however recent studies have pointed out the possibility of enhanced forces even within galaxies in vainshtein theories , opening them up to astrophysical tests ( chan & scoccimarro 2009 ; hui & nicolis 2012 ) .",
    "the logic of screening of the fifth force in scalar - tensor gravity theories implies that signatures of modified gravity will exist where gravity is weak .",
    "in particular , dwarf galaxies in low - density environments may remain unscreened as the newtonian potential @xmath5 , which determines the level of screening , is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in the milky way .",
    "hence dwarf galaxies can exhibit manifestations of modified forces in both their infall motions and internal dynamics .",
    "hui , nicolis & stubbs ( 2009 ) and jain & vanderplas ( 2011 ) discuss various observational effects while vikram et al ( 2012 , in preparation ) present a set of tests from current observations .",
    "stars within unscreened galaxies may show the effects of modified gravity .",
    "chang & hui ( 2010 ) and davis et al .",
    "( 2011a ) describe the effects on giant and main sequence stars , respectively : essentially the enhanced gravitational force makes stars of a given mass brighter and hotter than in gr .",
    "they are also more ephemeral since they consume their fuel at a faster rate .",
    "for the sun the potential @xmath6 ( we set @xmath7 and work with the amplitude of the potential throughout ) . coincidentally , the potential of the milky way is close to this value  and is believed to be sufficient to screen the galaxy so that solar system tests of gravity are satisfied .",
    "thus main sequence stars whose masses are similar to that of the sun are likely to be partially or completely screened .",
    "it is worth noting that these screening conditions are found by considering static , non - dynamical spherical objects sitting inside a fixed scalar field .",
    "davis et al . ( 2011a ) have shown that stars , as dynamical objects which support themselves under the action of the enhanced gravity , can be partially unscreened at newtonian potentials where this simple model would predict them to be completely screened , especially for higher mass objects .",
    "red giants are at least ten times larger in size than the main sequence star from which they originated so they have @xmath8  thus their envelopes may be unscreened .",
    "the enhanced forces lead to smaller radii , hotter surface temperatures and higher luminosities than their gr doppelgangers . for @xmath0 theories",
    "( capozziello et al 2003 ; nojiri & odintsov 2003 ; carroll et al 2004 ; starobinsky 2007 ; hu & sawicki 2007 ) with background field values ( @xmath1 ) in the range @xmath9@xmath10 , chang & hui ( henceforth ch ) find that compared to gr a solar mass red giant has radius @xmath11 smaller by over 5% , luminosity @xmath12 larger by over 50% at fixed effective temperature @xmath13 , while @xmath13 itself is higher by about 5% at fixed @xmath12 .",
    "they point out that the change in surface temperature of about 150 kelvin may be detectable from data on the red giant branch in observed hertzsprung - russel ( hr ) diagrams .",
    "we focus on specific stages of the evolution of giants and supergiants to seek different observational signatures .",
    "the first feature , well known for its use in obtaining distances , is the nearly universal luminosity of @xmath14 stars at the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "the second is the period - luminosity relation of cepheids , which are giant stars with @xmath15 that pulsate when their evolutionary tracks cross a near universal , narrow range in @xmath13 known as the _",
    "instability strip_. the tight relation between luminosity and other observables is what makes these stars valuable distance indicators  it also makes them useful for tests of gravity . for background field values in the range @xmath9@xmath10 , the trgb luminosity is largely robust to modified gravity while the cepheid @xmath16 relation is altered",
    ". measurements of these properties within screened and unscreened galaxies then provide tests of gravity : the two distance indicators should agree for screened galaxies but not for unscreened galaxies .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in  2 we briefly describe chameleon gravity ( a full discussion for the interested reader is given in appendix a ) and explain the differences in stellar evolution due to its influence . in ",
    "3 the properties of cepheids in gr and mg are presented , as well as a summary of relevant observations ; the corresponding details of trgb distances are presented in  4 .  5 contains our main results based on a comparison of cepheid and trgb distances .",
    "water masers in ngc 4258 are used for a second tests in  6 , and other distance indicators are discussed .",
    "we conclude in  7 .",
    "here we will briefly review the parameters that provide tests of gravity , motivated by the chameleon - like screening mechanisms .",
    "we refer the interested reader to appendix a for the full details and examples of some of the more common models .",
    "there are two parameters in these theories .",
    "the first , @xmath17 ( see appendix a and davis et al .",
    "2011a ) determines how efficient the body is at screening itself . if the magnitude of the surface newtonian potential @xmath18 then the object will be completely unscreened whilst",
    "if the converse is true then the body will be at least partially screened ( see equation [ eq : screenrad ] in appendix a ) .",
    "currently there are two different constraints on @xmath17 in the literature .",
    "the newtonian potential of the sun is around @xmath19 and the milky way has a similar value and so if one demands that these objects self screen then @xmath20 is ruled out observationally .",
    "independent constraints come from cosmological observables and cluster abundances and set an upper bound @xmath21 for @xmath0 models ( schmidt , vikhlinin & hu 2009 ; lombriser et al 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "our analysis here constitute an independent constraint , so we examine several possible uses of trgb , cepheid and water maser distance indicators to test gravity .    the second parameter in these models is @xmath22 , which sets the strength of the fifth force in unscreened regions .",
    "a completely unscreened object will feel a fifth force that is proportional to the newtonian force and the combined forces simply amount to a rescaling of @xmath23 by @xmath24 for partially screened objects , the total force in the region exterior to the screening radius can be described by a position dependent rescaling of g : @xmath25\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the mass interior to a shell of radius @xmath27 .",
    "we will consider tests of chameleon theories that probe ranges of @xmath17 and @xmath22 well below current astrophysical limits .",
    "for concreteness in evaluating screening conditions we work with @xmath0 models , which are chameleon models with parameters : @xmath28 where @xmath1 is a parameter commonly used in the literature to constrain the model ( hu & sawicki 2007 ) .",
    "@xmath29 is also the value found in the high density limit of the environmentally dependent dilaton ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we will also consider other values of @xmath22 in comparisons with observations .    in @xmath0 theories , the parameter @xmath1 sets the screening condition for an isolated spherical halo ( hu & sawicki 2007 ) : @xmath30 .",
    "the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile is a good approximation for halos of most galaxies both in gr and @xmath0 theories ( lombriser et al .",
    "it is useful to express the newtonian potential in terms of the scale radius @xmath31 of the nfw profile as : @xmath32 where we have followed hu & sawicki ( 2007 ) in using @xmath33 to represent the mass contained within @xmath34 ( see also schmidt 2010 ) .",
    "the screening condition can then be conveniently expressed in terms of the observable maximum circular velocity @xmath35 as : @xmath36 for the late - type dwarf galaxies of interest here , the peak circular velocity is likely to be reasonably well estimated by the observed rotation curves .",
    "the effects of inclination and of limited radial coverage typically lead to @xmath37 level underestimates of @xmath35 . for the range of circular velocities used in our sample",
    ", we probe @xmath1 values in the range @xmath38 .",
    "the structure of a spherically symmetric star is obtained by solving the equations of stellar structure that at a given radius @xmath27 relate @xmath26 to @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41  respectively the pressure , density and temperature . the opacity @xmath42 and the energy generation rate @xmath43",
    "are needed to close the equations .",
    "we will denote the radius of the star as @xmath11 , so that @xmath44 is the total mass and @xmath45 the total luminosity .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are determined in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 by equations of state which are independent of gravitational physics .",
    "as noted by ch and davis et al .",
    "2011a , modifying gravity only alters the gravitational physics , which is entirely contained in the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath49 which represents the condition for the outward pressure to balance the ( now enhanced ) inward gravitational pull and remain static . note that the modification is expressed purely as a change in @xmath23 , which becomes dependent on @xmath27 if the star is partially screened according to equation [ eq : g(r ) ] .",
    "the other three equations  the continuity , radiative transfer and energy generation equations  are all unaffected by this change in @xmath23 .",
    "the result is that unscreened stars of a given mass are more compact , brighter , and have a larger effective temperature than screened stars of identical mass and chemical composition .",
    "they also have a shorter main sequence life - time due to their increased burning rate and finite fuel supply .",
    "we will assume that changes in the gravity theories occur on timescales longer than the evolutionary timescales of stars .",
    "since we are interested in massive post - main sequence stars , evolutionary timescales are shorter than a billion years , typically orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "thus provided the main sequence is the same as in gr ( i.e. for @xmath50 ) , the star s post - main sequence evolution begins at the same point in the hr diagram as in gr , and subsequently responds to a static ( but possibly @xmath27-dependent ) @xmath23 .",
    "our results do not require this assumption but it simplifies the story .",
    "the complete system of stellar structure equations for main sequence stars can be solved under certain simplifying assumptions ( see davis et al .",
    "however , if one really wants to look at the dynamical and nuclear properties , as well as the structure of post main sequence stars then a numerical prescription is needed . in this work",
    "we shall use a modification of the publicly available stellar evolution code mesa ( paxton et al .",
    "2011 ) presented in ( davis et al .",
    "mesa can simulate individual stars of any given initial mass and metallicity and includes a fully consistent implementation of nuclear reaction networks , mass loss , convection , radiative transfer , opacity tables and metallicity effects . in brief , it is a one - dimensional ( in that it assumes spherical symmetry ) code that divides the star into radial cells of unequal width , each with a set of properties such as mass , temperature etc .",
    "the implementation of chameleon gravity into mesa uses a quasi - static approximation where the structure of the star is solved first and then the value of @xmath23 is updated in every cell given this structure .",
    "this approximation is good provided that the time between successive stellar models is smaller than the timescale over which the changes in @xmath51 are significant and mesa provides a facility to ensure that this is always the case .",
    "this method has been checked against that used by ch , who use a scalar - field ansatz and interpolation between different cells , and the results have been found to be indistinguishable .",
    "our method uses the general screening properties set out in appendix a and as such , applies to generic screening behavior , not only chameleons .",
    "the implicit relation for the screening radius is given in appendix a ( equation [ eq : screenrad ] ) and is completely equivalent to the condition @xmath52 given an initial stellar model , the integral [ eq : starscrrad ] is performed from the stellar surface , cell by cell until the condition is satisfied .",
    "the cell where this is so is then designated as the screening radius and the value of @xmath23 is changed according to equation [ eq : g(r ) ] in all cells exterior to this .",
    "the star is then allowed to evolve under this new gravity until the next stellar model is reached and the process is repeated .",
    "vs. @xmath53 ) is shown for stars with different masses as indicated .",
    "the black vertical lines shows the blue edge ( left ) and red edge ( right ) of the instability strip . at each crossing of the instability",
    "strip the star pulsates as a cepheid variable .",
    "the fits for the instability strip are taken from alibert et al 1999 .",
    ", width=377 ]      cepheids are a class of massive , pulsating giant stars whose time period @xmath46 is related to luminosity @xmath12 in a well understood way .",
    "after a giant reaches the tip of the red giant branch , its luminosity falls and it moves into the core helium burning stage .",
    "stars that are sufficiently massive , @xmath54 , actually follow trajectories called loops , which at three or more phases cross the instability strip  set by a narrow range in effective temperature @xmath13 . while in the instability strip , their luminosity and radius oscillate with a time period of days - weeks in a very regular manner .",
    "we are concerned here with a class of pulsating stars called ( classical ) cepheids .",
    "the radial oscillations in a cepheid are the result of acoustic waves resonating within the star . for much of the lifetime of a star ,",
    "its envelope is stable to pulsations ",
    "the exception is the instability strip .",
    "figure [ fig : t - l - mass ] shows the post main sequence evolution of stars of different masses .",
    "the instability strip arises due to the presence of a he@xmath55 ionisation zone in the stellar envelope located where the temperature is around @xmath56 k ( corresponding to the ionisation potential of he ) .",
    "the pulsation is driven by the @xmath42-mechanism ( and to a small extent the @xmath57-mechanism ) .",
    "the opacity throughout the majority of the star is given by kramer s law , @xmath58 .",
    "in the ionisation zone however , the gradient @xmath59 and so a small compression , which increases the temperature slightly , causes a large increase in the opacity , absorbing radiation and damming up energy .",
    "this further increases the opacity , resulting in an outward pressure which drives the pulsations .",
    "this driving is only really effective when the thermal time - scale of the zone is comparable to the pulsation period , which requires it to be located in the so called _ transition region _ , where the stellar processes ( which are adiabatic in the star s interior ) are becoming non - adiabatic",
    ". the instability strip therefore corresponds to the region in the h - r diagram where the ionisation zone coincides with this transition region .",
    "stars can cross the instability strip multiple times .",
    "the 1st crossing of the instability strip is before the star goes up the red giant branch and is far too brief to be observationally irrelevant .",
    "the 2nd crossing of the instability strip is the first crossing after the tip of the red giant branch when the star is on the lower part of the blue loop .",
    "and the 3rd crossing is when it is on the upper part of the blue loop .",
    "the 2nd and 3rd crossing of the strip , and in particular on the blue edge , is probably where cepheid properties are best understood .",
    "there are nearly as many observed cepheids on the 2nd and 3rd crossing .",
    "we will use the 3rd crossing of a 6 solar mass star as our fiducial case ( observed cepheids are typically 6 - 8 solar mass stars ) .    to estimate the pulsation period",
    ", one needs to go beyond hydrostatic equilibrium and consider the full dynamical radial acceleration of a fluid element at radius @xmath27 , which is described by the momentum equation : @xmath60 the time period of pulsations @xmath61 may be estimated through various approximations : 1 . as the sound crossing time for the diameter of the star , giving @xmath62 where @xmath57 is the ratio of specific heats and @xmath47 is the mean density of the star .",
    "this expression assumes that physical variables like the density and temperature can be used .",
    "the dependence on @xmath23 and @xmath47 is essentially correct , but the dependence on @xmath57 is not correct .",
    "2 . by perturbing equation [ eqn : acceleration ] as well as the equations of continuity , radiative transfer and energy generation",
    "one can derive a full non - adiabatic wave equation for infinitesimal fluid elements in the lagrangian picture ( see cox 1980 ) .",
    "if one linearises this equation in the adiabatic limit and searches for standing wave solutions then the resultant eigenvalue equation for the radial wave , the linear adiabatic wave equation ( lawe ) , gives the pulsation periods .",
    "the lawe is highly non - trivial and depends on the zeroth order pressure and first adiabatic index @xmath63 and so the general case requires numerical matrix or shooting methods applied to simulations involving envelope models .",
    "one simplifying assumption that can be made however is that of a static sphere of fixed equilibrium radius and constant density composed of gas with an adiabatic relation @xmath64 . under this assumption",
    ", the lawe can be solved for the period of small oscillations ( note that the linear and adiabatic nature precludes a calculation of the amplitude ) to find : @xmath65 using @xmath66 for an ideal monatomic gas yields @xmath67 @xmath61 above is in the range of 1 - 100 days for a range of relevant red giant densities .",
    "this equation gives values of @xmath61 that are fairly close to more detailed calculations as well as observations .",
    "we note that detailed numerical models are able to predict not just the period but many detailed properties of cepheids , including the variations of size and luminosity , the location of the instability strip , and the dependence on mass and metallicity ( e.g. bono et al 1998 ) .",
