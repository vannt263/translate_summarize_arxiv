    "research on graphene today appears to have reached a peak , mainly because the material is rather difficult to be utilized in electronic devices due to limitations in high quality mass production .",
    "thus , interest is shifting to hybrid systems with other two - dimensional materials , both for application purposes and to create opportunities to better understand basic physical and chemical phenomena @xcite .",
    "heterostructures of semiconducting mos@xmath0 and graphene already have been demonstrated , showing potential particularly in data storage @xcite .",
    "moreover , the joint two - dimensional nature of the two components can be utilized for fabricating large scale flexible nanoelectronic devices .",
    "for example , a new generation of field effect transistors based on heterostructures of ws@xmath0 and graphene on transparent and flexible substrates has shown a promising performance @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional topological insulators in a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) state have metallic edges that sustain dissipationless current flow @xcite . for graphene",
    "this effect has been predicted by kane and mele using an analytical model @xcite .",
    "since the energy gap of graphene is tiny ( @xmath1 mev ) due to the small intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite , experimental observation of the qsh state is difficult .",
    "various ideas promising an enhancement have been put forward , all based on proximity to areas in that the electrons are subject to strong soc , including heavy atom deposition @xcite , h adsorption @xcite , and heterostructures with mote@xmath0 and bi@xmath0te@xmath2 @xcite .    experimental realization of a qsh state in the topological insulator hgte @xcite has initiated efforts on other materials , in particular on graphene .",
    "recently , experiments have demonstrated that graphene in a strong magnetic field supports also a qsh state , which is interesting for novel quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "however , the experimental difficulties coming along with large magnetic fields @xcite call for alternative approaches . in this work",
    "we propose hybrid structures that host a qsh state in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "specifically , we employ density functional theory ( including van der waals corrections ) to study the following systems : ( a ) graphene on ws@xmath0 or wse@xmath0 and ( b ) graphene sandwiched between two ws@xmath0 or wse@xmath0 layers .",
    "our results prevail that the soc in graphene can be enhanced such that a reasonable energy gap is achieved at the k / k@xmath3 points with large band splitting .",
    "qsh states are demonstrated for the sandwich systems .",
    "the heterostructures are constructed by joining a @xmath4 supercell of graphene with @xmath5 supercells of the dichalcogenides .",
    "a vacuum layer of at least 15   thickness guarantees that there is no artificial interaction perpendicular to the two - dimensional system due to the periodic boundary conditions . for the structural relaxation",
    "we employ the quantum - espresso code @xcite , using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , in order to include the van der waals forces .",
    "the atomic positions are optimized until all forces have converged to less than 0.005 ev /  .",
    "the electronic structure calculations then are performed using the vienna ab - initio simulation package @xcite both with pure gga and including the spin . a plane wave cutoff energy of 450 ev and a monkhorst - pack @xmath6 k",
    "- mesh are employed .",
    ".distance between the subsystems ( @xmath7 ) , binding energy per c atom ( e@xmath8 ) , band gap ( e@xmath9 ) , valance band splitting ( @xmath10 ) , and conduction band splitting ( @xmath11 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the systems under consideration are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . the lattice parameters of the graphene ( 9.98  ) and ws@xmath0 supercells ( 9.57  ) give rise to a lattice mismatch of 2.7% .",
    "the distance between the two subsystems converges to @xmath12  , see table i , which is a typical value for graphene on a semiconducting substrate .",
    "we observe no modification of the c@xmath13c bond lengths , whereas the w@xmath13s bond lengths ( 2.45   to 2.46  ) are modified as compared to pristine ws@xmath0 ( 2.39   @xcite ) because of the lattice mismatch .",
    "we find @xmath14   for graphene on wse@xmath0 with a c@xmath13c bond length of 1.42  , which is the value of pristine graphene . the w@xmath13se bond length ( 2.52   to 2.53  ) is almost the same as in pristine wse@xmath0 ( 2.52   @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we obtain @xmath15   and @xmath14 for graphene sandwiched between ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 layers , respectively , whereas the other structural parameters are the same as for the simple contacts .",
    "graphene is zero - gap semiconductor with very weak soc @xcite . on the other hand , ws@xmath0 is semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.30 - 1.35 ev @xcite .",
    "its structural and electronic properties have been studied extensively , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "ws@xmath0 is widely utilized for @xmath16/@xmath17-doped field effect transistors , for example @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the synthesis and characterization of graphene on ws@xmath0 has been reported in ref .",
    "the authors claim that a device based on this system can operate at room temperature with good current modulating capacity .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "2(a ) the band structure obtained for graphene on ws@xmath0 without soc , demonstrating some interaction between the two subsystems , though without chemical bonding .",
    "the binding energy @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the total energies of the hybrid structure , ws@xmath0 , and graphene , respectively , amounts to 53 mev per c atom , in agreement with ref .  @xcite . due to this weak interaction , a small band gap of 0.9 mev",
    "is obtained , see the zoomed view in fig .",
    "2(a ) , with degeneracy of the k and k@xmath3 points .    when the soc is switched on in the calculation , the spin degeneracy of the bands is lifted , resulting in valence and conduction band splittings of 33 mev ,",
    "see table i , with a small band gap of 0.7 mev , see the right hand side of fig .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed for graphene on bi@xmath0te@xmath2 and mote@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the characteristic shape of the bands near the fermi level signifies a qsh phase ( band inversion under preserved time - reversal symmetry ) , similar to the observations in inas / gasb @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the bands above and below the fermi level have opposite spin in agreement with the signature of the qsh phase .",
    "a similar picture appears in germanene nanorods embedded in fully h - passivated germanene @xcite and in two - dimensional sn @xcite , for which the gap can be strongly enhanced by the application of the strain such that devices can operate at room temperature .     and ( b ) graphene sandwiched between ws@xmath0 layers",
    ". zoomed views of the k point are shown to clarify the band splitting.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in fig .",
    "2(b ) we present results for graphene sandwiched between ws@xmath0 layers .",
    "we find a 0.1 mev band gap without soc and one of 1.1 mev when the soc is taken into account .",
    "the shape of the band structure again reflects a qsh state .",
    "larger valence and conduction band splittings of 92 mev and 99 mev , respectively , are achieved because two ws@xmath0 layers are attached to the graphene , see table 1 , similar to the 70 mev band splitting of graphene in contact with the ( 111 ) surface of bife@xmath2 ( which is magnetic and thus hosts a quantum anomalous hall effect @xcite ) .     and",
    "( b ) graphene sandwiched between wse@xmath0 layers . zoomed views of the k point are shown to clarify the band splitting.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we also study hybrid systems with monolayer wse@xmath0 , which is a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.65 ev @xcite .",
    "the binding energy of graphene on wse@xmath0 turns out to be 54 mev and thus is similar to the ws@xmath0 case . on the other hand , the band gap of 3.6 mev ,",
    "see fig .",
    "3(a ) , is about 5 times larger than for ws@xmath0 , reflecting the stronger soc in wse@xmath0 .",
    "a comparison of the bulk properties of ws@xmath0 and wse@xmath0 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "again , according to fig .",
    "3(a ) , the spin degeneracy at the k and k@xmath3 points is lifted under inclusion of the soc .",
    "the band structure qualitatively reflects the same characteristics as demonstrated for ws@xmath0 in fig .",
    "however , the valence and conduction band splittings are enhanced to 145 mev and 132 mev , respectively , and so is the band gap ( 0.9 mev ) , see the zoomed view in fig .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the fact that the spin splitting due to soc is about 50 mev larger in bulk wes@xmath0 than in bulk wse@xmath0 @xcite . for graphene sandwiched between wse@xmath0 layers",
    ", we find a reduction of the band gap from 3.0 mev to 1.0 mev under soc with enhanced valence and conduction band splittings of 149 mev and 153 mev , respectively , compare fig .",
    "3(b ) to fig .",
    "2(b ) , as to be expected from our previous discussion . in the wse@xmath0 systems",
    "the qsh effect therefore is significantly more pronounced than in the ws@xmath0 systems .",
    "based on first - principles calculations , we have investigate the structural and electronic properties of hybrid systems consisting of graphene and ws@xmath22 or wse@xmath0 .",
    "band gaps of few mev are obtained due to the interaction between the component materials . moreover ,",
    "band inversion is found at the k / k@xmath3 points , which indicates qsh states . by the preserved time - reversal symmetry",
    "together with the enhancement of the effective soc in graphene , these systems are able to realize topological phases and therefore qsh states . usually a strong magnetic field is needed to achieve a qsh state in graphene @xcite , while we propose systems in that a qsh state appears without magnetic field , which is a great advantage .",
