    "over the past decades scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy techniques have been established as an important experimental tool to study strongly correlated electron systems with a spatial resolution down to the atomic scale . in these experiments the tunneling current between the sample and the stm tip is measured as a function of its position and the applied voltage .",
    "the tunneling current is directly related  @xcite to the local density of states ( ldos ) in the sample ; thus stm experiments provide a tool to investigate the spatial dependence of the ldos , which may arise for example due to impurities .",
    "these spatial modulations can be analyzed in terms of the fourier transform of the tunneling conductance which is directly proportional to the fourier transform of the ldos . using this method of analyzing stm data",
    "one can infer informations about the bulk state of matter like the properties of its quasiparticle excitations .",
    "for example , this has been used to study high - temperature superconductors  @xcite as well as carbon nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the ldos and stm in the presence of boundaries have been carried out in particular for one - dimensional systems including luttinger liquids  @xcite , open hubbard chains  @xcite , and charge - density wave ( cdw ) states  @xcite . in these systems",
    "the coupling to impurities is relevant  @xcite , which leads , at sufficiently low energies , to an effective cutting of the system into disconnected pieces . in this sense",
    "the effect of an impurity can be modeled by a boundary condition .",
    "previous studies of the fourier transform of the ldos in both gapless  @xcite and gapped  @xcite systems revealed a pinning of the cdw at the impurity as well as individually propagating spin and charge degrees of freedom .    here",
    "we study a quarter - filled one - dimensional mott insulator in the presence of a strong impurity potential .",
    "it has been established  @xcite that for sufficiently strong interactions double umklapp processes are relevant and generate a gap in the charge sector . as a microscopic realization one may think of a quarter - filled hubbard model extended by including nearest - neighbor interactions , which possesses  @xcite an insulating phase for sufficiently strong repulsions .",
    "experimentally these systems are relevant for the description of organic quasi - one - dimensional conductors , i.e. the bechgaard and fabre salts  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the low - energy behavior of the ldos by employing the field theoretical description of the mott insulator .",
    "the spectrum consists of massless spin excitations ( spinons ) carrying spin @xmath0 but no charge and massive charge excitations ( solitons and antisolitons ) carrying charge @xmath1 but no spin . in this framework",
    "the impurity is modeled by a boundary for the collective excitations .",
    "in particular , we will focus on signatures of dispersing quasiparticles in the spatial fourier transform of the ldos , as they have been clearly observed in similar studies of luttinger liquids  @xcite and half - filled mott insulators as well as cdw states  @xcite .",
    "the spectral function of the translationally invariant , quarter - filled mott insulator has been previously derived  @xcite by essler and tsvelik . from the quantum numbers stated above",
    "it is clear that an electron will fractionalize into at least one spinon and two antisolitons .",
    "thus the spectral function exhibits a featureless scattering continuum of at least three excitations , which is also consistent with experimental results  @xcite from angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy on bechgaard salts .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we will briefly discuss the field theoretical description of the quarter - filled mott insulator . in sec .  [",
    "sec : gf ] we present our results for the single - particle green function .",
    "this will then be used to derive an analytic expression for the ldos , which we will discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : ldos ] .",
    "our main result is presented in eq .   as well as figs .",
    "[ fig : plot1 ] and  [ fig : plot2 ] , which show the fourier transform of the ldos in the presence of an impurity .",
    "surprisingly , we find two dispersing features which follow the dispersion relations and respectively .",
    "these features can be interpreted as arising from an antisoliton or a spinon - antisoliton pair propagating between the position of the stm tip and the impurity .",
    "in addition , we observe a non - dispersing singularity at momentum @xmath2 which is indicative of a pinning of a spin - density wave ( sdw ) at the boundary .",
    "a detailed analysis further reveals dispersing features originating in propagating spinons and antisoliton pairs .",
    "the suppression of these features is attributed to the `` quasi - fermionic '' behavior of antisolitons with equal momenta .",
    "finally we explain the different findings in the spectral function and the ldos . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bbs ] we discuss the effect of possible boundary bound states on the ldos and in sec .",
    "[ sec : hfmi ] we compare our results to the half - filled mott insulator studied  @xcite previously . finally , in sec .",

    "readers mainly interested in the qualitative features of the ldos may start with this section and study the detailed results afterwards .",
    "technical details have been moved to the appendix .",

    "the extended hubbard model can be used as an effective model for the description of bechgaard salts  @xcite ; its spectral and transport properties have been investigated in detail using various techniques  @xcite .    instead of working with the microscopic model we will study here the corresponding low - energy field theory .",

    "[ fig : plot4].a we show @xmath116 for different momenta .",
    "we clearly observe a dispersing feature ( indicated by up - arrows ) following @xmath117 this feature originates in the process where one antisoliton propagates with momentum @xmath95 while the other antisoliton and the spinon possess zero momentum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot4].b ) .",

    "fig : plot4].a ) at @xmath118 the critical momentum @xmath93 can be determined from the condition that the spin and charge excitations have the same group velocity @xmath119 which leads to @xmath120 thus this feature can be thought of as arising from an antisoliton with momentum @xmath93 and a spinon carrying momentum @xmath121 , while the second antisoliton stays at rest ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot4].c ) .",
    "the fact that the propagating antisoliton and the spinon have the same group velocity results in an increased probability that both simultaneously arrive at position @xmath94 after reflection at the boundary .    the observed splitting of the quasiparticle peak is reminiscent of what is found for the single - particle spectral function in the translationally invariant , half - filled mott insulator  @xcite as well as the ldos of a cdw state in the presence of a boundary in the regime of attractive interactions  @xcite .",

    "first , indicated by up - arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot5].a , there is a feature following @xmath129 this feature can be thought of as arising from the propagation of both antisolitons with momenta @xmath130 and thus the same velocity , while the spinon has zero momentum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot5].b ) .",
    "the second feature is found at @xmath131 provided @xmath95 exceeds the critical momentum @xmath132 .",
    "this feature is indicated by down - arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot5].a .",
    "the interpretation is that both antisolitons carry momentum @xmath93 while the excess momentum @xmath133 is carried by the spinon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot5].c ) .",
    "we note that at finite momentum @xmath91 the term @xmath116 dominates the ldos as can be seen by comparing the scales in figs .",
    "[ fig : plot3].c ,  [ fig : plot4].a , and  [ fig : plot5].a , respectively .",
    "more importantly , the dispersing features originating in @xmath116 are much more pronounced than those resulting from @xmath106 and @xmath128 .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that , at least in the naive interpretation of figs .",
    "[ fig : plot4].b and c , the antisolitons involved in processes contributing to @xmath116 possess different momenta as one of them is at rest while the other propagates through the system .",
    "in contrast , the dispersing features in @xmath106 and @xmath128 originate from processes in which the two antisolitons possess equal momenta ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : plot3].d as well as  [ fig : plot5].b and c , respectively ) .",
    "thus their relative rapidity vanishes and the scattering matrix is @xmath134 ( see app .",
    "[ app : ff ] ) .",
    "the resulting `` quasi - fermionic '' behavior leads to a strong suppression of the dispersing features in @xmath106 and @xmath128 via the pauli principle .    finally let us comment on the different findings in the spectral function  @xcite of the translationally invariant system and the ldos in the presence of a boundary .",
    "the spectral function is obtained from the green function @xmath135 via fourier transformation with respect to @xmath136 and @xmath94 .",
    "the contributing processes require the propagation of all excitations , and in particular both antisolitons , from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "thus one may expect a dispersing feature at @xmath139 from the antisolitons propagating with the same momentum @xmath130 .",
    "in addition , above the critical momentum @xmath140 a linearly dispersing feature following @xmath141 is expected .",
    "indeed these are exactly the conditions  @xcite for the threshold below which the spectral function vanishes . above the threshold",
    "the spectral function is rather featureless , in particular there are no dispersing peaks associated with the propagation of charge or spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the absence of dispersing features may be attributed to the `` quasi - fermionic '' behavior of antisolitons , as all processes contributing to the spectral function will contain antisolitons with equal momenta .",
    "in contrast , the processes contributing to the ldos are given by the fractionalization of an electron at position @xmath94 , the propagation of the two antisolitons and the spinon through the system , and the subsequent recombination at the original position @xmath94 . in particular , processes where the momentum @xmath95 is solely carried by one of the antisolitons or a spinon - antisoliton pair will contribute , resulting in the dispersing features at @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "the observation of these features thus underlines that the spectral function and the ldos probe rather different physical processes .",
    "while the spectral function requires the propagation of all excitations between two points in the system , the ldos also probes processes where only one or two excitations propagate to the impurity and back .",
    "up to now we have concentrated on the boundary conditions for the electron field or equivalently for the canonical bose fields . in this section",
    "we will consider more general phase shifts for the electron fields which lead to arbitrary dirichlet boundary conditions for the bose fields .",
    "as is well known , such boundary conditions can result in the existence of boundary bound states ( bbs s ) , which are expected  @xcite to manifest themselves in the ldos as features within the spectral gap . here",
    "we will focus on general dirichlet boundary conditions in the charge sector @xmath142 while in the spin sector we still assume @xmath143 . in the boundary state formalism  @xcite applied here the information about the boundary condition",
    "is encoded in the boundary reflection matrix @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , the existence of a bbs will show up as a pole in the physical strip @xmath144 . as was shown in ref",

    "an interpretation is obtained by noting that the electron decomposes into one spinon and one antisoliton , which then propagate through the system . as the leading processes involve only individual antisolitons , the `` quasi - fermionic '' behavior of the antisolitons discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : ldos2 ] does not affect the ldos .",
    "in contrast , in the quarter - filled system we observe only two dispersing modes following and respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot2 ] ) .",
    "all other dispersing features discussed above are strongly suppressed due to the `` quasi - fermionic '' behavior of the antisolitons .",
    "finally , in the presence of a bbs with energy @xmath174 the ldos of the half - filled mott insulator possesses a non - dispersing singularity with @xmath175 which originates from the creation of a spinon and the bbs .",
    "in contrast , in the quarter - filled case the ldos is smooth at the threshold @xmath164 which originates from the simultaneous creation of one antisoliton and the bbs .",
    "in this section we compare qualitative aspects of the ldos of various one - dimensional systems in the presence of a boundary or strong impurity potential . we discuss the spatial fourier transform @xmath176 defined in .",
    "specifically we consider luttinger liquids  @xcite , half - filled mott insulators ( or cdw states )  @xcite , and the quarter - filled mott insulator investigated in sec .",

    "( we note that the ldos in the small - momentum regime @xmath50 behaves qualitatively similar . )",
    "the first feature , which all three systems have in common , is a singularity of the ldos @xmath177 at @xmath87 , which originates in the pinning of a charge or spin density wave at the impurity . in the case of a luttinger liquid",
    "the strength of this singularity depends on the luttinger parameter @xmath178 and thus on the interactions between the electrons , whereas in both the half - filled and quarter - filled mott insulator the ldos behaves as  @xcite @xmath179 .",
    "furthermore , as was pointed out in ref .  , the gap of the ldos in the half - filled mott insulator is given by the soliton mass @xmath33 , which equals the thermal activation gap and is half of the gap observed in optical measurements .",

    "the thermal activation gap is given by @xmath33.,width=321 ]    in addition , the ldos possesses various dispersing features ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plot7 ] ) . in the luttinger liquid case one observes two linearly dispersing modes corresponding to individually propagating spin and charge degrees of freedom respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plot7].a ) . in the half - filled mott insulator",
    "an electron decomposes into massless spin excitations and one charge excitation with mass @xmath33 .",
    "propagating spin excitations give rise to a linearly dispersing mode with velocity @xmath37 , while the propagating charge excitation results in a curved dispersion relation .",
    "in addition , there exists a critical momentum @xmath180 at which the group velocity of the charge excitation equals @xmath37 . at this momentum a third linearly dispersing feature splits away from the charge mode , which has its origin in the collective propagation of spin and charge degrees of freedom with equal velocities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : plot7].b ) .",
    "we note that the qualitative behavior discussed for the half - filled mott insulator is also expected in other systems possessing gapless excitations in one sector and gapped ones in the other like , for instance , cdw states .",
    "finally , in the quarter - filled mott insulator an electron decomposes into massless spin excitations and two charge excitations with masses @xmath33 .",
    "this results in a curved dispersion originating in the propagation of one charge excitation while the second one stays at the position of the stm tip .",
    "this dispersion splits at the critical momentum @xmath93 due to the collective propagation of one charge excitation and additional spin degrees of freedom ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : plot7].c ) .",
    "we note that one does not observe individually propagating spin excitations .",
    "the relevant processes would require the two charge excitations to possess equal momenta , which is forbidden by their `` quasi - fermionic '' behavior ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ldos2 ] ) .    to sum up ,",
    "at sufficiently large momenta @xmath95 we observe two linearly dispersing modes in a luttinger liquid , two linear and one curved dispersion relation in a half - filled mott insulator , and one linear and one curved dispersion in a quarter - filled mott insulator .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that characteristic properties of the bulk state of matter and its electronic excitations can be infered from studying spatial modulations of the ldos in the presence of an impurity .",
    "the ldos discussed in this article is directly related to the tunneling current measured in stm experiments .",
    "if the density of states in the stm tip is approximately independent of energy , the tunneling conductance will be given by the thermally smeared ldos of the sample at the position of the tip  @xcite @xmath181 where @xmath182 denotes the fermi function .",
    "@xmath176 can then easily be obtained via spatial fourier transformation . in this context",
    "the models discussed above apply to quasi - one - dimensional materials at energies above the cross - over scale to three - dimensional behavior .",
    "this situation might be experimentally realized for example in stripe phases of high - temperature superconductors  @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite , bechgaard and fabre salts  @xcite , self - organized atomic gold chains  @xcite , and two - leg ladder materials  @xcite .",
    "as discussed above already the knowledge of qualitative properties such as the presence of a spectral gap and its relation to the thermal activation gap as well as the number and positions of singularities can reveal substantial information about the electronic properties and excitations of quasi - one - dimensional materials . a more detailed analysis of quantitative features like the strength of singularities or the precise positions of dispersing modes can even lead to estimates for the luttinger parameter and the velocities of charge and spin excitations .",
    "there are , of course , experimental limitations .",
    "obviously the experimental resolution and thermal broadenings have to be sufficiently small to clearly distinguish the different singularities and dispersing modes .",
    "moreover , the simplyfied relation does not contain  @xcite the matrix elements for the tunneling from the sample into the tip , which may introduce a non - trivial spatial dependence of the tunneling conductance on the ldos and thus hamper a natural interpretation in terms of propagating excitations .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a quarter - filled mott insulator in the presence of an impurity , which was modeled by a boundary condition for the electron fields . in this system",
    "we calculated the @xmath52-component of the spatial fourier transform of the ldos using the boundary state formalism together with a form - factor expansion .",
    "the ldos is dominated by a singularity at @xmath2 , which is indicative of a pinning of a sdw at the impurity .",
    "furthermore , we observed several dispersing features above the two - soliton gap @xmath79 .",
    "we identified their physical origin as spin and charge degrees of freedom , which propagate between the stm tip and the impurity , and attributed their relative strength to the `` quasi - fermionic '' behavior of charge excitations with equal momenta .",
    "this also explains the absence of dispersing features in the spectral function  @xcite of the translationally invariant system and underlines that the spectral function and the ldos probe rather different physical processes .",
    "we further showed that a bbs in the charge sector leads to a non - vanishing ldos within the two - soliton gap .",
    "finally , we discussed our results in the context of other one - dimensional systems , i.e. luttinger liquids and half - filled mott insulators , and argued that the measurement of the spatial modulations in the ldos can be used to extract detailed informations about the electronic states of quasi - one - dimensional systems .",
