    "about @xmath0 sec after the big bang , the universe underwent a phase transition in which the electroweak gauge symmetry was reduced from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . in the standard model ( sm ) and",
    "many of its extensions , the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is understood in terms of the dynamics of a fundamental scalar field , the higgs @xmath3 : the vacuum @xmath4 preferred at high temperatures becomes unstable at a certain `` critical temperature '' @xmath5 and the higgs develops a vacuum expectation value ( vev )  @xcite . the nature of this transition is a subject of considerable interest .",
    "for example , is the ewpt a violent , out - of - equilibrium event accompanied by massive entropy production ( first - order transition ) or a gentle , quasi - adiabatic process ( second - order transition ) ?",
    "answering this question would have far - ranging implications : for example , electroweak baryogenesis , which theoretically is arguably the most attractive of the mechanisms proposed to explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry , can only occur if the ewpt is strongly first - order  @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain direct information on the ewpt from astrophysical observations , due to the long and complex history of the universe since the transition .",
    "( note , however , that gravitational waves produced in a first - order transition might be observable at lisa  @xcite . ) luckily , the dynamics of the phase transition can be deduced theoretically , once the fundamental lagrangian governing the physics at the electroweak scale is known . for example , it is well known that if there is no physics beyond the sm relevant at that scale , the transition is never first - order for the higgs boson mass obeying the current experimental lower bound , 114.4 gev .",
    "of course , the gauge hierarchy problem and other arguments strongly suggest that physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) should appear at the electroweak scale , and the nature of the ewpt depends on the ( as yet unknown ) details of that physics .",
    "observing all of the weak - scale bsm particles and measuring their masses and interactions ( in particular with the higgs ) would provide sufficient information to determine the order of the transition . in practice , however , this will be a very difficult task for the upcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and even for a more distant next - generation @xmath6 collider such as the proposed international linear collider ( ilc ) , especially in models where some of the new states are gauge singlets",
    ". it would therefore be useful to identify simpler observables that are correlated with the order of the transition . in this paper , we propose that the value of the higgs boson cubic self - coupling is one such observable .",
    "specifically , we argue that models leading to a first - order phase transition predict a large ( typically order - one ) deviation of the higgs cubic coupling from its sm value .",
    "we show that this is the case in three toy models , which capture three basic mechanisms for obtaining a first - order ewpt : loop - induced corrections to the higgs effective potential , nonrenormalizable operators in the potential , and mixing between the weak - doublet higgs and singlet scalars at the weak scale .",
    "the only exceptions to this statement that were observed in our analysis are due to accidental cancellations between large corrections to the higgs cubic of different origins .",
    "thus , while non - observation of a large deviation of the higgs cubic from the sm prediction would not completely rule out a first - order ewpt , it would make it very unlikely .",
    "the correlation between a strong first - order ewpt and a large deviation of the higgs self - coupling from the sm value was already noted , in the specific contexts of low - cutoff models  @xcite and the two - higgs doublet model  @xcite .",
    "here , we will argue that this corellation is in fact much more general , and applies ( with a small caveat requiring no accidental cancellations ) in a very broad class of models .",
    "in this paper , we will not restrict ourselves to a specific extension of the sm .",
    "we will instead study a series of toy models , which capture the important features of realistic bsm theories exhibiting strong first - order ewpt .",
    "the toy models analyzed in this section satisfy two basic conditions .",
    "first , the only scalar field which changes its value during the ewpt is the neutral component @xmath3 of the sm higgs doublet with gauge - singlet scalars is allowed . ]",
    "@xmath7 . with this assumption ,",
    "the finite - temperature effective potential @xmath8 completely specifies the dynamics of the ewpt .",
    "second , at tree level , the higgs sector is weakly coupled and can be adequately described by a renormalizable lagrangian , i.e.  no irrelevant terms are important .",
    "many theoretically motivated models satisfy these conditions , including the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite for a broad range of parameters corresponding to the so - called higgs decoupling region , little higgs models  @xcite such as the littlest higgs with t - parity , and others .",
    "interesting models which violate either one of these conditions and exhibit first - order ewpt also exist ; we will study such examples in sections  [ sec:3 ] and  [ sec:4 ] .    with the above conditions , the tree - level higgs potential has the form v^t(h ) = - h^2 + h^4 , while the masses of the sm and bsm particles are given by m_i^2(h ) = m_0i^2 + a_i h^2 .",
    "at the one - loop level , the higgs effective potential , including finite - temperature corrections , can be determined completely once the values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 for every particle in the theory are known . in practice , particles with @xmath11 ( weak coupling to the higgs ) can be neglected . in the sm",

    "while the potential itself remains finite ( @xmath26 ) , the cubic coupling defined in   diverges at that point .",
    "resummation of the infrared logarithms is required to correctly evaluate @xmath27 in the neighborhood of that point .",
    "this resummation is conveniently achieved by switching from the zero - momentum renormalization scheme to the on - shell scheme  @xcite .",
    "technically , this is equivalent to adding an extra term to @xmath28 , and interpreting the second derivative at the minimum of the corrected potential as the physical ( on - shell ) higgs mass .",

    "if the model contains bosons with masses small compared to @xmath30 , multi - loop infrared - divergent contributions need to be included to correctly analyze the dynamics of @xmath3 .",

    "the same approximate scaling laws apply to models with @xmath117 identical species of fermions as well .",
    "since the gauge charges of the added states have no effect on the higgs potential in the one - loop approximation , we conclude that the results of our toy - model analyses in fact apply to _ any _ model where a single multiplet ( or a single supermultiplet ) dominates the bsm contribution to the higgs potential .",
    "the mssm with light stops , and models with multiple gauge - singlet scalars as in ref .",
    "@xcite , are in this category .",
    "even if multiple bsm states with different masses and couplings contribute to the higgs potential , the qualitative picture should remain the same .",
    "in fact , we checked that a toy model with two scalars , whose masses and higgs couplings are varied independently , produces results very similar to the single - scalar case .",

    "this scenario demonstrates a direct proportionality between @xmath150 and @xmath56 , but an inverse proportionality between @xmath150 and @xmath27 .",
    "the origin of this supression is as follows .",
    "the terms in the potential involving only the doublet components of the @xmath137 produce a positive contribution to @xmath27 , as in the sm .",
    "( this contribution reduces to the sm value in the no - mixing limit . ) the term involving doublet - singlet mixing , as well as the @xmath156 term , produce a negative contribution for @xmath157 , since their coefficients @xmath158 and @xmath159 are negative .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath158 and @xmath159 is effectively determined by the requirement of strong first - order ewpt : it is these terms that introduce the desired `` bump '' in the potential .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the link between the dynamics of the ewpt and the deviation of the cubic higgs boson self - coupling in extensions of the sm .",
    "we studied this link in a series of toy models .",
    "our toy models implement three mechanisms by which the weak - scale new physics could turn the second - order adiabatic transition predicted in the pure sm into a first - order transition . in the first set of models , the dynamics",
    "is determined by large quantum corrections to the higgs potential , both zero- and finite - temperature , from loops of new particles ( possibly , but not necessarily , gauge singlets ) with strong coupling to the higgs . in the second model , the first - order transition is due to the presence of a nonrenormalizable operator in the higgs potential . in the third model ,",
    "the crucial new feature is the tree - level mixing between the higgs and an extra scalar singlet . in all cases",
    ", we found that models that exhibit a strong first - order ewpt predict large deviations of the higgs cubic coupling from the standard model value .",
    "order - one deviations are typical .",
    "the models of the first and second classes typically predict an enhancement in the higgs cubic coupling , while in the models of the third class both signs are equally likely .",
    "the only cases where the cubic coupling does _ not _ deviate significantly from the sm prediction are due to accidental cancellations among unrelated contributions to this coupling .",
    "thus , we conclude that a measurement of the higgs cubic coupling consistent with the sm prediction would strongly disfavor ( although not completely rule out ) a first - order electroweak phase transition",
    ". a discovery of a substantial deviation of this coupling from the sm would keep the possibility of a first - order transition open , but would not conclusively prove it , as discussed at the end of section  [ singles ] .",
    "while a measurement of the higgs cubic coupling is very difficult at the lhc , a 20%-level measurement appears to be within the reach of the proposed luminosity or energy upgrades of the lhc , as well as the ilc . based on the analyis",
    ", we conclude that such a measurement could serve as a sensitive probe of the dynamics of the electroweak phase tranition .",
    "if no deviation from the sm is observed , it would be very unlikely that the transition is first - order .",
    "note that at least some of the sources of the first - order transition are very difficult to exclude by any other means : for example , a gauge - singlet scalar that does not mix with the higgs at tree level but has a strong quadratic coupling , as in the model of section  [ singles ] , is essentially impossible to detect directly as long as the decay @xmath124 is kinematically forbidden .",
    "therefore , even with a large body of knowledge about the bsm particles and their couplings from the lhc and ilc experiments , the question of the order of the phase transition would be very difficult to settle definitively . a measurement of the higgs cubic coupling would be crucial in addressing this issue .",
    "it is exciting that the next generation of collider experiments will likely contribute to our understanding of cosmology .",
    "one example is the possibility that the dark matter particle will be discovered , and its propserties measured , at the lhc and the ilc .",
    "this connection has attracted much attention in the literature , and has been analyzed both in specific models of new physics  @xcite , and in a model - independent framework  @xcite .",
    "understanding the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition is another open question in the early universe cosmology where the lhc and ilc experiments will have an important role to play . in this paper",
    ", we studied one simple experimentally observable quantity that is tightly correlated with the order of the transition .",
    "it is also possible that a combination of mass and coupling measurements could be used to completely reconstruct the higgs potential , providing a much more detailed picture of the transition",
    ". it would be interesting to understand what quantities would need to be measured , and how precise the measurements would need to be .",
