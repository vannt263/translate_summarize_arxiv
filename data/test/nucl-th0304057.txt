    "if the density of pions becomes large , bose - einstein correlation may also lead to a strongly emitting system which has been called a pion laser @xcite .",
    "the pion laser model has been recently solved analytically by t. csrg and j. zimanyi @xcite .",
    "the importance of bose - einstein correlations has also been illustrated in the observation of a condensation of atoms in a harmonic oscillator or laser trap @xcite .",
    "previous interest in pionic distributions have centered around the possibility of intermittency behavior @xcite and fractal structure based on parallels with turbulent flow in fluids .",

    "we compared various particle multiplicity distributions within the hypergeometric model hga .",
    "our results show that even though various distributions have the same mean and fluctuation , the distribution itself or the underlying mechanism could be different .",

    "thus , to find the correct distribution and underlying mechanism from various data more information than just the mean and fluctuation are necessary and new variables should be found which are quite different between different models .",
    "for example , higher order reduced factorial cumulants need also to be evaluated such as the third order cumulant @xmath296 .",
    "applications of our approach to the charged multiplicity data of l3 and h1 are given .",
    "the mean @xmath297 , fluctuation variable @xmath162 , void scaling variable @xmath160 , and third order reduced cumulant variable @xmath296 obtained from these experimnets are compared with various models discussed in this paper .",
    "the value of the third cumulant @xmath296 shows that the grw1d model can fit the charge multiplicity data of l3 and h1 .",
    "the hga model also gives a fit to the l3 data , but is not as successful as grw1d with respect to the third order reduced cumulant of the h1 data .",
    "both have very similar multiplicity distributions as shown in fig.[jetdat ] which compares the two models with the charged particle multiplicity distributions of jets for l3 and h1 data .",
    "differences appear in the high multiplicity events with reduced multiplicity @xmath298 .",
    "the reduced third cumulant is negative for the h1 data of table [ tabldat ] .",
    "negative values of a cumulant require negative values of the parameter @xmath0 which are allowed in grw1d if the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are also taken as negative , but a negative value of @xmath0 is not acceptable in hga since this would require a value of @xmath2 greater than 1 and thus a complex @xmath1 .",
    "we also discuss the kno scaling behavior for these data and conclude that the kno scaling behavior would not be clearly exhibited in the jets for l3 and h1 .",
    "in this paper we have also generalized the compound distribution that arises from sequential process which may reveal the dynamical structure of the distribution .",
    "specifically , the underlying sequential picture involves a two step process where the final distribution arises from the production of clusters followed by a subsequent decay of the clusters . for the hga model",
    ", the final distribution is obtained from compounding a poisson distribution of clusters with a nb distribution coming from the decay of each of the clusters .",
    "the hga may arise through a three step sequential process of poisson - poisson - logarithmic compound distribution .",

    "<S> various phenomenological models of particle multiplicity distributions are discussed using a general form of a unified model which is based on the grand canonical partition function and feynman s path integral approach to statistical processes . </S>",
    "<S> these models can be written as special cases of a more general distribution which has three control parameters which are @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation to these parameters to various physical quantities are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> a connection of the parameter @xmath0 with fisher s critical exponent @xmath3 is developed . using this grand canonical approach , </S>",
    "<S> moments , cumulants and combinants are discussed and a physical interpretation of the combinants are given and their behavior connected to the critical exponent @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> various physical phenomena such as hierarchical structure , void scaling relations , kno scaling features , clan variables , and branching laws are shown in terms of this general approach . </S>",
    "<S> several of these features which were previously developed in terms of the negative binomial distribution are found to be more general . </S>",
    "<S> both hierarchical structure and void scaling relations depend on the fisher exponent @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> applications of our approach to the charged particle multiplicity distribution in jets of l3 and h1 data are given . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that just looking at the mean and fluctuation of data is not enough to distinguish these distributions or the underlying mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the mean , fluctuation and third cummulant of distribution determine three parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a generalized random work model fits the data better than the widely used negative binomial model . </S>"
