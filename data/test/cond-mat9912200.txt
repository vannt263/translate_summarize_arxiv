    "coupled spin 1/2 chains have attracted much attention lately due to the large number of their experimental realizations , as well as to the variety of theoretical techniques , both analytical and numerical , available to study the relevant models .",
    "spin 1/2 chains , owing to the jordan - wigner transformation@xcite , show properties remarkably similar to those of interacting one dimensional fermions with their low energy properties described by an effective luttinger liquid theory@xcite .",
    "recently it has been realized that these properties are drastically modified when the spin 1/2 chains are coupled together forming ladder systems@xcite . in this case , in a way very similar to haldane s spin - s problem @xcite , a gap is found to open for an even number of chains while the system remains gapless if the number of chains is odd .",
    "this phenomenon has been thoroughly investigated both analytically @xciteand numerically @xcite , and corresponding experimental systems were identified .",
    "typical examples of two - chain spin 1/2 ladders exhibiting a gap are @xmath1@xcite and @xmath2@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an example of a gapless three - chain ladder is @xmath3@xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the difference between odd and even number of legs@xcite or odd and even spin@xcite has been understood qualitatively through a generalization of the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem .",
    "the theorem states that if the ground state is unique the system will necessarily be gapless .",
    "this is indeed the case for an odd number of coupled spin 1/2 chains .",
    "more recent theoretical work has emphasized the role of boundary conditions in the transverse direction in the formation of spin gaps .",
    "the results quoted above - the opening of a gap for an even number of coupled chains , gaplessness if the number is odd - are valid for open boundary conditions ( obc ) .",
    "it turns out that when periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are imposed on the transverse direction a gap opens for both cases of even and odd number of chains although the underlying reasons and the natures of the gaps are different . in the case of an even number of coupled chains ,",
    "the reason for the gap is the formation of spin singlets along the transverse direction , similarly to the case of chains with open boundary conditions . when the number of coupled chains is odd a two fold degenerate dimerized ground state",
    "is obtained in the case of pbc@xcite - in contrast to its uniqueness in the obc - allowing for a gap in the spin excitations .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state in the case of pbc can be understood as a consequence of the fact that pbc are frustrating for an odd number of legs . to date , no experimental system described by coupled antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 chains with periodic boundary conditions and an odd number of legs has been reported .",
    "when , further , leg - leg biquadratic interactions are included new states emerge .",
    "a system of two spin-1/2 spin chains enters a spontaneously dimerized phase with a gapped spectrum exhibiting non - haldane spin - liquid properties@xcite .",
    "the elementary excitations are neither spinons nor magnons , but pairs of propagating triplet or singlet solitons connecting two spontaneously dimerized ground states . subsequently more non - haldane spin - liquid models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently , these models of spin ladders with biquadratic exchange have been advocated@xcite as possible models for the formation of a spin gap in @xmath0 and @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we study the low energy physics of the three - leg ladder with periodic boundary conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_tube ] ) .",
    "this model is called the spin - tube model in the following . by analyzing in detail its effective low energy hamiltonian ( leh ) , which consists of two _",
    "non - equivalent _ coupled xxz chains of spins and chiral degrees of freedom , in the presence of a biquadratic exchange@xcite , we will show that the dimerized ground state of this model falls in the universality class of the non - haldane spin liquids . in the case of xxz chains with a biquadratic coupling and for @xmath5 , we find that the ising antiferromagnetic order can compete with the dimer order , and we will describe the resulting phase diagram .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec.[model ] we introduce the spin tube model .",
    "we sketch the derivation of the strong interchain coupling effective hamiltonian and discuss its relation with two spin 1/2 chains coupled by a biquadratic interaction .",
    "we then discuss the symmetries and recall the results already known on the two chains with biquadratic interactions , in particular the prediction of a spin gap .    in sec .",
    "[ bosonization ] we discuss the bosonization treatment of two non - equivalent xxz chains coupled by a biquadratic interaction .",
    "we show that this hamiltonian contains a term @xmath6 that is responsible for the formation of a spin - gap and singlet order , as well as terms @xmath7 that cause antiferromagnetic order . to analyze the competitions of these terms ,",
    "we derive renormalization group equations . using these equations",
    ", we estimate in which part of the phase diagram we should expect a competition of antiferromagnetism and dimer order .",
    "we also estimate the equation of the phase boundary between the singlet and the antiferromagnetic order .    in sec.[sec :",
    "dimerized ] we analyze in details the dimerized phase .",
    "the dimerized ground state is two - fold degenerate and is formed of alternating singlets of spins and pseudospins .",
    "the elementary excitations above the ground state carry a spin @xmath8 as well as a pseudospin @xmath8 .",
    "they can be seen as formed by the introduction of a spin and a pseudospin in the pattern of alternating singlets .",
    "similar excitations were obtained in ref .   and it was shown that they lead to response functions very different from those of a haldane spin liquid .",
    "numerical evidence for such excitations was also obtained in ref . .",
    "in section [ sec : gap_closure ] , we analyze the effect of a magnetic field strong enough to close the gap of the dimer phase . when both chains are magnetic , the situation is similar to the one obtained with two coupled spin ladders @xcite . in the more physical situation , when only one of the two chains is magnetic , the ground state properties are those of a two component luttinger liquid . in the case of spin - orbital models , spin and orbital degrees of freedom",
    "decouple completely but the presence of orbital modes should affect the specific heat . in the case of the spin - tube , we show that in contrast to spin - orbital models , the spin - correlation functions are affected by the presence of auxiliary gapless modes .",
    "we also show that for non - equivalent chains ( a case that is realized in spin - orbital models ) the exponent of the spin correlations is _ non - universal _ at the transition .",
