    "number density evolution of luminous qsos is one of the important pieces of key observational information on understanding blackhole formation and accretion history in particular , we put emphasis on high luminosity qsos ( @xmath78 ) , where the xlf is consistent with the slope of @xmath79 at all redshift and free from complicated luminosity dependence of the evolution rate and contamination from star formation activity .",

    ", we do not find evidence for decrease of the space density beyond @xmath81 .",
    "using the maximum - likelihood fitting , we have checked the significance of the inconsistency . requiring that the number density drops beyond @xmath82 as ssg95 , the likelihood value ( varies as @xmath83 ) increased by 3.3 , showing that the significance of the inconsistency is 93% , which is marginal . in the @xmath84 , we have 5 qsos in the sample , while expected number in the presence of the decrease like the ssg95 result is 2.4 .",
    "including more surveys with a good completeness at the depth of @xmath85 @xmath86 $ ] would enable us to discuss whether the soft x - ray selected qso number density drops beyond @xmath87 .",
    "there are some discrepancies between our work and previous ones from several authors from combinations of the _ einsten _ extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) and _ rosat _ surveys ( e.g. boyle et al .",
    "1994 ; page et al . 1996 ; jones et al .",
    "1997 ) , in that our results are not consistent with ple .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that our combined sample has more agns at fainter fluxes , thus better statistics excludes simpler description .",
    "however , a direct comparision of the @xmath88 estimates of the xlf between our sample and that of jones et al . , for example , shows no descrepancy in the @xmath89 bin , and high luminosity part ( @xmath90 ) of the @xmath91 , but descrepancies appear at the low luminosity end of the @xmath91 regime .",
    "the sxlfs in the regime of bright sources , i.e. the rbs / sa - n based on the rass for our work and the emss sample used by them , are mutually consistent . thus the uncertainties in conversion of fluxes between _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ bandpathes do not make significant contributions to the descrepancy .",
    "two likely major causes are : ( 1 ) inclusion of apparently narrow - line objects which have indications of agn activities in our work , while they mainly argue the xlf for broad - line objects .",
    "( 2 ) : because of the misidentification of the faintest x - ray sources ( @xmath92 ) to field galaxies in their pspc positioning , they miss some agns . a more complete analysis ( e.g. comparing redshift distribution ) using the original catalogs will be discussed in miyaji et al .",
    "the extrapolations of our best - fit ldde models explain 50 - 70% of the 0.5 - 2 kev extragalactic cxrb , considering errors of the fits .",
    "clusters of galaxies are expected to contribute about 10% in this band .",
    "the remaining contributors could be some low - luminosity galaxies / agns ( @xmath93 ) ( see fig .",
    "2a of hasinger 1998 ) . these have about the same local volume emissivity as the agns in our sxlf , but uncertainties up to by a factor of few may exist , since this low - luminosity galaxy xlf is based on a sample of galaxies nearer than @xmath94 mpc and the role of local overdensity can be important .",
    "also practically no direct observational information exists for the evolution of these low luminosity sources .",
    "if the low - luminosity galaxies / agns contribute significantly to the remaining cxrb , these can be : ( 1 ) : intrinsically low luminosity agns ( 2 ) high - intermediate redshift obscured agns , which are expected to contribute much of the harder cxrb and redshifted into the _ rosat _ band .",
    "( 3 ) : star formation activity .",
    "it is also possible that the behavior of the agn sxlf ( @xmath95 ) at intermediate - high redshifts does not follow the simple extrapolation of the current ldde model below the luminosities corresponding to the survey limit at that redshift .",
    "especially our particular formula for the ldde tends to make the @xmath96 drop rapidly below the survey limit .",
    "also the ldde model - integrated intensity is sensitive to the lowest flux objects in the sample , where incompleteness may play a role .",
    "these are fundamental uncertainties in the integrated intensity extrapolated from the best - fit representations of some functional form .",
    "our work is deeply indebted to the effort of the observers and other members on the surveys used in our analysis .",
    "we particularly thank the collaborators of the rbs , marano , and rixos surveys for allowing us to use the samples before publication .",
