    "recently , @xcite presented an idea on the mechanism of the super - eddington luminosity .",
    "shortly after hydrogen ignites on a white dwarf , the envelope becomes unstable to develop a porous structure in which the effective opacity becomes much smaller than the normal opacity for uniform medium .",
    "corresponding to the reduced effective opacity , the effective eddington luminosity becomes larger .",
    "therefore , the diffusive energy flux can exceed the eddington value for uniform medium , even though it does not exceed the effective eddington luminosity .",
    "based on this idea , @xcite presented a light curve model for the super - eddington phase of classical novae .",
    "they assumed a reduced opacity in early phases of nova outbursts and reproduced the optical light curve of v1974 cyg .",
    "this is the first theoretical model for the super - eddington light curves . in the present paper ,",

    "@xcite presented 1455    continuum light curves for twelve novae and showed that the duration of the uv outburst is a good indicator of the speed class of novae , i.e. , a faster nova shows a shorter duration of the uv outburst .",
    "this 1455    light curve is an important clue in modeling the super - eddington phase @xcite and also a useful tool in estimating the white dwarf mass and distance to the star @xcite . here",
    ", we make a model of the super - eddington phase for five galactic novae , v693 cra , v1974 cyg , v1668 cyg , v351 pup , and os and , because their 1455    light curves are available from the beginning of the super - eddington phase to the uv decay .",

    "after a thermonuclear runaway sets in on an accreting white dwarf ( wd ) , the photosphere greatly expands to @xmath4 .",
    "the optical luminosity reaches a maximum value , which often exceeds the eddington limit .",
    "after that , the photosphere moves inward whereas the envelope matter goes outward .",
    "the wind mass - loss begins in the very early phase of the outburst and continues until the photospheric temperature rises to @xmath5 .",
    "the envelope mass decreases owing to the wind and nuclear burning @xcite .",
    "the decay phase of novae can be well represented with a sequence of steady state solutions as described by @xcite .",
    "we have solved a set of equations , i.e. , the equations of motion , mass continuity , radiative diffusion , and conservation of energy , from the bottom of the hydrogen - rich envelope through the photosphere .",
    "the winds are accelerated deep inside the photosphere , so they are called `` optically thick winds . ''",
    "we assume that the opacity is effectively reduced by a factor @xmath6 , @xmath7 in the super - eddington phase , where @xmath8 is the opal opacity @xcite and @xmath6 is the opacity reduction factor that represents the reduced ratio of the effective opacity in a porous envelope .",
    "@xcite assumed that @xmath6 is a function of the temperature and time , i.e. , @xmath6 is unity in the outer region of the envelope ( @xmath9 ) , but takes a certain constant value @xmath10 at the inner region @xmath11 , and it changes linearly between these values . here",
    "@xmath12 is a function of time that has the maximum value at the optical peak and then gradually decreases to unity . choosing an appropriate @xmath13 ,",
    "kato & hachisu reproduced the light curve of v1974 cyg in the super - eddington phase .",
    "once the temperature dependence of @xmath6 is given , @xmath14 is uniquely determined by fitting with both the optical and uv light curves . in the present paper ,",
    "we first adopt the same temperature dependence of @xmath6 as in @xcite .",
    "we call it model 1 .",
    "we adopt another type of function for @xmath6 .",
    "we call it model 2 , in which @xmath6 changes in a more inner region of the envelope , i.e. , @xmath15 at @xmath16 but @xmath17 at @xmath18 and changes linearly between these values .",
    "the function of @xmath6 should be closely linked with radiation instabilities against a porous structure of the atmosphere .",
    "however , we do not know how and when the porous structure develops in a nova envelope and how much the opacity is reduced .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we assume the two functions of @xmath6 , i.e. , model 1 and model 2 .",
    "model 1 corresponds to the case that the porous structure develops from the bottom of the envelope to a lower temperature region beyond the peak of the opal opacity at @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the peak value of the opacity is reduced by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "model 2 corresponds to the case that the porous structure does not extend to the opacity peak at @xmath19 .      in v1500 cyg , which is one of the brightest novae , the temporal evolution of the spectrum and the fluxes are well understood as blackbody emission during the first three days and as free - free emission after that @xcite . in the modeling of the super - eddington phase we divide the optical light curve into three phases @xcite",
    "the first is the super - eddington phase , in which we simply assume that photons are emitted at the photosphere as a blackbody with a photospheric temperature of @xmath20 . in the next phase ,",
    "the optical flux is dominated by free - free emission of the optically thin ejecta outside the photosphere .",
    "the flux of free - free emission can be roughly estimated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the flux at the wavelength @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number densities of electrons and ions , @xmath26 is the volume of the ejecta , @xmath27 is the wind mass - loss rate , and @xmath28 is the velocity at the photosphere . here , we use the relation of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the density and velocity of the wind , respectively .",
    "we substitute @xmath27 , @xmath32 and @xmath28 from our best fit model",
    ". we can not uniquely specify the proportional constant in equation ( [ free - free - wind ] ) because radiative transfer is not calculated outside the photosphere .",
    "instead , we choose the constant to fit the light curve @xcite .",
    "when the nova enters a nebular phase , strong emission lines such as [ ] dominantly contribute to the visual light curve .",
    "then the visual light curve gradually deviates from our free - free light curve of equation ( [ free - free - wind ] ) .",
    "this is the third phase .",
    "after the optical maximum , the photospheric radius of the envelope gradually decreases while the photospheric temperature ( @xmath20 ) increases with time . as the temperature increases , the main emitting wavelength of radiation shifts from optical to uv .",
    "the uv 1455   flux reaches a maximum at @xmath33 .",
    "after the uv flux decays , the supersoft x - ray flux finally increases .",
    "figure [ v693crauv ] shows the theoretical 1455    light - curves of various wd masses with an envelope chemical composition of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the evolutional timescale depends strongly on the wd mass .",
    "more massive wds evolve faster than less massive wds .",
    "the evolution speed also depends on the chemical composition because enrichment of heavy elements drives more massive winds through the opacity enhancement , which accelerate nova evolutions .",
    "therefore , the duration of 1455    burst depends on the wd mass and chemical composition of the envelope .    figure [ uvwidth ] depicts the dependence of such duration of the 1455    outburst for various wd masses and chemical compositions . here",
    ", the duration is defined by the full width at the half maximum of the 1455    light curve @xcite .",
    "once the chemical composition is determined , we can estimate the wd mass from this figure .",
    "@xcite fitted theoretical light curves with the 1455    observation and determined the wd masses for v1668 cyg and v1974 cyg .",
    "they find that their wd masses show good agreement in the light - curve fittings of optical , infrared , and x - ray for the entire period of the outburst . in this sense , the 1455    light curve is a good indicator of the wd mass . in the present paper , we estimate the wd mass from the 1455    light - curve fitting and use it in modeling of the super - eddington phase .",

    "table 1 summarizes the model parameters and our main results , i.e. , from top to bottom row , ( 1 ) object name , ( 2 ) outburst year , ( 3 ) adopted function of the opacity reduction factor , ( 4 ) wd mass , ( 5)(9 ) adopted chemical composition , ( 10 ) reddening , ( 11 ) opacity reduction factor @xmath14 at the optical maximum , ( 12 ) distance estimated from the peak of the 1455   light - curve , ( 13 ) duration of the 1455    outburst defined by the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) , ( 14 ) peak bolometric luminosity , ( 15 ) absolute and ( 16 ) apparent @xmath26-magnitudes corresponding to the peak luminosity , ( 17 ) excess of the super - eddington in @xmath26-magnitude , i.e. , the difference between the peak magnitude of our model ( @xmath52 ) and the peak magnitude of a light curve model with the normal opacity ( @xmath139 ) for the same wd mass and the same envelope composition , ( 18 ) duration of the super - eddington phase , ( 19 ) time in which @xmath140 drops by 3 magnitude from the peak in our theoretical model , ( 20 ) mass ejected during the period from the first point of each light curve until the wind stops .",
    "there are no time - dependent calculations of nova outbursts in which porous instabilities widely develop .",
    "so , it is difficult for us to estimate how much the opacity is reduced in the nova envelopes . here , we have simply assumed @xmath6 to be a function of the temperature and time .",
    "then , we have determined @xmath14 so as to reproduce the observed light curve of each object .",
    "the referee kindly pointed out that the opacity reduction factor would be expressed as a function of the current state of the envelope which is independent of time .",
    "after a porous instability widely develops in the envelope , it may settle into an equilibrium state .",
    "if our opacity reduction factor represents such an envelope state , it may be a function of a small number of physical parameters / variables that represent the current state of the envelope .    in order to search for such parameters / variables , we plot the wind mass - loss rate ( @xmath27 ) , envelope mass ( @xmath141 ) , and ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure at the critical point of each steady wind solution ( @xmath142 ) against @xmath14 in figure [ superedpara ] .",
    "we plot seven light - curve models for five objects in table 1 .",
    "these seven models are different from each other in their characteristic properties such as the wd mass , chemical composition , and opacity model .",
    "first of all , we can easily see that the difference between model 1 and model 2 hardly makes large difference on these three variables ; the curves for model 1 and model 2 are very close to each other in v693 cra and v1974 cyg .",
    "next , we see that the two models of v693 cra are separated from the others in the wind mass - loss rate .",
    "this is because the wd of v693 cra is as massive as 1.3 @xmath79 whereas the other wds are @xmath143 .",
    "the wind mass - loss rate is much larger on a massive wd than on a less massive one if we compare them at the same envelope mass , as shown in our previous work @xcite .",
    "therefore , the difference in the wind mass - loss rates of v693 cra in figure [ superedpara ] can be attributed to the difference in the wd masses .",
    "so we may conclude that the mass - loss rate itself is not a main factor that determines the opacity reduction factor @xmath14 .    in the envelope mass ,",
    "all the curves are almost similar to each other .",
    "this suggests that @xmath6 is closely related to the envelope mass . in other words ,",
    "the porous instability involves at least a wide area of the envelope , and @xmath14 decreases as the envelope mass decreases with time due to wind mass - loss .    in the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure at the critical point of steady - state wind solutions , where the wind is accelerated @xcite",
    ", we see that all the curves are also very similar to each other .",
    "the ratio @xmath121 is almost constant in a region below the critical point .",
    "therefore , @xmath142 represents a mean value of @xmath121 in the region where the opacity is reduced .",
    "we have checked other physical variables such as the luminosity , photospheric radius , temperature , and radius at the critical point , but we found that all these variables are largely scattered from each other , i.e. , not bunched like in @xmath141 and @xmath142 of figure [ superedpara ] .    we may conclude that the envelope mass and @xmath142 are the key parameters that represent the current state of envelopes with a porous structure . probably , @xmath142 should be closely linked with the property that the porous instability is a kind of radiation instability and the envelope mass may be related with the property that the porous instability involves a large part of the envelope , although we do still not know the accurate condition for the porous instability .",
    "both the wd mass and chemical composition are fixed in the present work .",
    "if we choose a different set of these parameters , we have different time scales of theoretical light curves not only in the very early phases but also in the later phases of the outbursts including the epochs when the wind mass - loss stops and hydrogen burning ends . for v1974 cyg and v1668 cyg ,",
    "multiwavelength observations are available until the very late phase of the outburst and their wd masses are determined consistently with these observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for v1974 cyg and v1668 cyg ) .",
    "therefore , we adopt their estimates .    the decline rates of nova light - curve depend strongly on the wd mass and weakly on @xmath144 , very weakly on @xmath41 , but hardly on @xmath145 . therefore , the largest ambiguity in the estimation of wd masses comes from the accuracy of hydrogen content @xmath144 .",
    "the dependency of the wd mass on @xmath144 is roughly estimated as @xmath146 when @xmath147 and @xmath148 , using the `` universal decline law '' of nova light curves @xcite that nova light curves are almost homologous except for the very early phase ( i.e. , the super - eddington phase discussed here ) .",
    "here , @xmath149 means the wd mass estimated for @xmath150 and the original value of @xmath150 can be replaced with any other value , for example , @xmath126 .    for the other three objects , i.e. , v693 cra , v351 pup , and os and , there is no observational data in the late phase , i.e. , when the wind stopped and when the hydrogen burning ended .",
    "then we determined the wd mass only from the uv light curve fitting with a fixed chemical composition as shown in figure [ v693crauv ] .",
    "if we adopt a different set of the chemical composition , we have a slightly different wd mass as can be estimated from equation ( [ ne_wd_mass_x_depencency ] ) or figure [ uvwidth ] .",
    "nova distances are determined from the comparison between observed uv fluxes and calculated fluxes at the uv peak . in case of v693 cra and v351 pup , the super - eddington phase ended ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath151 , at the uv peak as shown in figures [ v693light ] and [ v351puplight ] .",
    "so , the distance can be determined independently of the reduced factor of @xmath6 . in case of v1974 cyg",
    ", the super - eddington phase still continues at the uv peak .",
    "the distances derived for model 1 and model 2 are the same within the accuracy of two digits as shown in table 1 , although these values themselves are somewhat larger than the values derived without the super - eddington phase ( @xmath98 ) as already mentioned in  5.1 . from these results , it may be concluded that the opacity reduction factor does not affect so much the distance estimate .",
    "this is because , in all the five objects , their super - eddington phases had already or almost ended ( @xmath152 ) at the uv peak .",
    "we present light - curve models of the super - eddington phases for five _ iue _ classical novae based on the optically thick wind theory , with an assumption that the opacity is reduced in a porous envelope @xcite .",
    "our models reasonably reproduce the optical and 1455    light curves .",
    "the distance is derived from the comparison between the observed peak value of the 1455    flux and the corresponding calculated value unless a dust shell absorbs the uv flux at its maximum .",
    "the derived distances of the five iue novae are consistent with the previous estimates .",
    "we wish to thank the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) for the visual data of v693 cra , v1974 cyg , v1668 cyg , v351 pup , and os and , and also the variable star observing league of japan ( vsolj ) of .",
    "we also thank a. cassatella for providing machine readable 1455    data of the five novae .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful and valuable comments that improved the manuscript .",
