    "in the recent study on quantum field theories and quantum mechanics , topologically neutral soliton molecules , which are locally composed of ( fractional ) instantons and anti - instantons , have been attracting a great deal of attention in relation to the ir - renormalon@xcite .",
    "imaginary ambiguities arising in amplitudes of such topologically neutral configurations can cancel out those arising in non - borel - summable perturbative series ( ir - renormalon ) in quantum theories under certain conditions on the spacetime manifold @xcite . in field theories on compactified spacetime with a small compact dimension ,",
    "these objects are termed as  bions \" @xcite .",
    "it is expected that full semi - classical expansion including perturbative and non - perturbative sectors as bions , which is called  resurgent \" expansion @xcite , leads to unambiguous and self - consistent definition of field theories in the same manner as the conjecture in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the resurgence in theoretical physics was at first investigated in the matrix model and topological string theory @xcite .",
    "then , the study on the topic has been extended to abjm theory @xcite , string and supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite , and general quantum systems @xcite . bions and resurgence in non - susy field theories , especially in the low - dimensional models , have been extensively investigated for the @xmath0 model @xcite , the grassmann sigma model @xcite , the principal chiral model @xcite , and the @xmath2 model @xcite . according to these studies , the leading - order renormalon ambiguity @xmath3 arising in non - borel - summable perturbative series , which corresponds to the singularity closest to the origin on the borel plane ,",
    "is compensated by the amplitude of neutral bions . on the other hand ,",
    "it is expected but not verified that the ambiguities corresponding to singularities further from the origin ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , ... ) are cancelled by amplitudes of bion molecules with more than four instanton constituents .",
    "in the case of quantum mechanics , not only the sector of zero instanton charge but also those of nonzero instanton charge contribute to physical observables such as the energy levels .",
    "the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite investigated quantum mechanics with several types of potential including the sine - gordon type .",
    "they showed that the leading instanton contributions are consistent with the perturbative calculation , and conjectured the explicit equation connecting perturbative and instanton contributions , which they call the generalized quantization condition .",

    ", we verify that all of our results agree completely with those based on the uniform - wkb calculations up to a four - instanton order .",
    "while the sine - gordon quantum mechanics is worth to study on its own , another strong motivation lies in its close relationship to small circumference limit of the two - dimensional @xmath0 model on @xmath1 ( circumference @xmath16 ) with the @xmath17-symmetric twisted boundary condition @xcite .",
    "however , we observe that some of the field configurations of the @xmath0 model are not faithfully represented by means of the sine - gordon quantum mechanics .",
    "one can derive the sine - gordon quantum mechanics from the two - dimensional @xmath0 model by applying the scherk - schwarz dimensional reduction , which requires a particular dependence of the phases of fields on the coordinate @xmath18 of compactified dimension ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is important to realize that only parts of field configuration of @xmath0 model can be consistent with this @xmath18 dependence .",
    "for instance , the bps solution of two fractional instantons is not consistent with the scherk - schwarz reduction , and hence its small circumference limit can not be described by the sine - gordon quantum mechanics . on the other hand , two adjacent instantons in the sine - gordon",
    "quantum mechanics are mutually non - bps , although each individual instanton may be understood as a limit of bps fractional instanton ( with a different @xmath18 dependence ) . even in the instanton and anti - instanton configurations ,",

    "this setting gives a precise relation between the @xmath323 model and the sine - gordon quantum mechanics . by sending @xmath404 to zero , we may be able to investigate how the contribution of the relative complex phase disappears in the reduction process from the @xmath323 model to the sine - gordon quantum mechanics . in the case of the @xmath0 model ,",

    "we have also shown that the neutral bion amplitude in @xmath0 model based on the potential including the relative phase moduli parameter gives corrections to the results obtained in the sine - gordon quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "our main results , that the multi - instanton amplitudes in the sine - gordon quantum mechanics are consistent with the large - order behavior of the perturbative calculations , and are completely reproduced by the uniform - wkb boundary conditions , strongly indicate the following facts : the uniform - wkb boundary condition provides the correct link between the perturbation series around the perturbative vacuum and non - perturbative instanton effects , and furthermore the perturbative calculation _ knows _ non - perturbative aspects of the quantum system in the first place .",
    "we can take the result as an evidence at least in the quantum mechanics , in favor of the resurgence conjecture , which gives an unambiguous and self - consistent definition of the quantum theory .",

    "<S> we propose an extension of bogomolnyi  zinn - justin prescription for multi - instanton configurations and an appropriate subtraction scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the multi - instanton contributions to the energy eigenvalue of the lowest band at the zeroth order of the coupling constant . for the configurations with only instantons ( anti - instantons ) , we obtain unambiguous results . for those with both instantons and anti - instantons </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain results with imaginary parts , which depend on the path of analytic continuation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the imaginary parts of the multi - instanton amplitudes precisely cancel the imaginary parts of the borel resummation of the perturbation series , and verify that our results completely agree with those based on the uniform - wkb calculations , thus confirming the resurgence : divergent perturbation series combined with the nonperturbative multi - instanton contributions conspire to give unambiguous results . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the neutral bion contributions in the @xmath0 model on @xmath1 with a small circumference , taking account of the relative phase moduli between the fractional instanton and anti - instanton . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sign of the interaction potential depends on the relative phase moduli , and that both the real and imaginary parts resulting from quasi - moduli integral of the neutral bion get quantitative corrections compared to the sine - gordon quantum mechanics . </S>"
