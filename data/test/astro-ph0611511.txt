    "since the discovery of the first extrasolar planet by mayor & queloz @xcite the number of known extrasolar planets has grown to more than 200 .",
    "most discoveries are based on measurements of radial velocities of stellar lines . due to the great contrast in optical brightness between the main sequence star and its planet(s )",
    "no planet has so far been seen directly in the optical range .",
    "a much better spectral contrast between an extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) and a star can be achieved in the ir band , where the planet s thermal emission peaks . indeed , recently chauvin et al .",
    "@xcite published an image of what seems to be the first egp outside our solar system ( albeit in a very wide orbit ) around the brown dwarf 2massw j1207334 - 393254 obtained in the infrared with vlt / naco .",
    "neuhuser et al . @xcite detected a substellar mass object around the t tauri star gq lup , also using vlt / naco , and determined a mass between 1 and 42 jupiter masses .",
    "the contrast can be increased further if one searches for planets around _ white dwarfs _ , which are about a factor of ten smaller than giant planets and typically @xmath2 to @xmath3 times less luminous than main sequence solar - type stars of spectral type g or k ( see e.g. burleigh et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    while planets closer than 35 au will probably not survive the post - main - sequence evolution and will migrate inwards and merge ( livio & soker @xcite ) , planets farther away should survive and adiabatically migrate outwards .",
    "their semimajor axis will increase by a factor @xmath4/@xmath5 as the central star loses mass ( duncan & lissauer @xcite ; burleigh et al .",
    "the detection of a brown dwarf that survived the engulfment by the envelope of a red giant star and migrated inwards ( maxted et al .",
    "@xcite ) is a fascinating discovery in this context and goes to show that brown dwarfs in close orbits around white dwarfs can exist .",
    "the seven single white dwarfs in the hyades ( hz4 , lb227 , vr7 , vr16 , hz7 , hz14 , lp475 - 242 ) have been observed with hst / nicmos in 2003 at two roll angles separated by 20 degrees through the f110w and f160w filters .",
    "two and four dithered frames , respectively , of 320s integration time each were recorded for each roll angle and each target in these filters , which corresponds to a total of one and two orbits of hst time per target , respectively .",
    "the single dithered frames were reduced using the hst pipeline , then oversampled by a factor two using cubic spline before registration and a fft - shift based combination for each roll angle . in each filter , the resulting frames corresponding to different roll angles were subtracted from each other ( see friedrich et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the results obtained for hz7 are presented in fig .  1 as an example",
    ".      observations were performed with the spitzer irac camera during a period of two months from september to november 2005 .",
    "the nine white dwarfs chosen supplemented already performed or ongoing programs of similar queries ; they are nearby ( @xmath6 pc ) and younger than 3 gyrs ( cooling plus main sequence age ) . with this",
    "information mid - ir fluxes of accompanying planets with 110@xmath7 and the expected photometric excess can be predicted with models of baraffe et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "since these calculations do not include thermal insolation by or reflected light from the parent star they could thus be regarded as lower limits .",
    "hence it follows that these spitzer data achieve limits of 310 m@xmath8 .    with standard software packages we processed basic calibrated data ( bcd ) and",
    "post - basic calibrated data ( pbcd ) and determined fluxes and magnitudes of our target stars . according to their effective temperatures",
    "a black body correction was applied ( reach et al .",
    "@xcite ) and an aperture correction for an aperture of 5 pixel radius on source determined ( reach et al .",
    "color correction introduces flux changes of about 12% , aperture correction changes of about 57% depending on the channel .",
    "some of the targets could not be detected in channel 4 .",
    "flux errors for channel 1 and 2 are on the 1% level , in channel 3 between 2% and 4% and in channel 4 between 5% and 7% with two exceptions , where uncertainties in channel 4 are 14% and 18% , respectively .",
    "the reason can be found in a higher background level .      in 2004",
    "two field white dwarfs were observed with vlt and naco in the h band .",
    "close to one of our targets a second object was found at 05 separation ( see zinnecker et al .",
    "if both objects were physically related , this would correspond to a separation of 25 au at a distance of 50 pc .",
    "the measured absolute @xmath9 magnitude of 13.7 mag at an estimated age of 0.5 gyr yields a mass of @xmath10 ( baraffe et al .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore a second epoch observation was performed in august 2006 with vlt and sinfoni in order to obtain information about common proper motion and the near - infrared spectrum of the putative companion in the @xmath9- and @xmath11-band .",
    "standard reduction was used to produce the image vs.  wavelength data cube .",
    "we validated the method used in the data reduction through simulations . for this purpose a fake companion of given brightness",
    "was introduced in each frame as a scaled version of the target , adding the appropriate noise , and checking that we could detect the signature of the companion after all reduction steps described above .",
    "2 shows the results of such a simulation for both filters and the same target as in fig .  1 , with a planet at 04 separation and 6 magnitudes difference in brightness .",
    "one can easily notice the pair of negative and positive images of the companion at the given position ( roll angle ) from the wd - star in the subtracted frame .",
    "such a simulation allows us to estimate the limiting brightness ratio as a function of separation and given snr of the detection .",
    "according to the cond models of baraffe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the limiting mass of the planetary mass companions that we are able to detect is typically about 10 jupiter masses at 05 separation ( see fig .  3 in friedrich et al .",
    "@xcite ) .      for all white dwarfs , fluxes measured in the four irac channels were compared to black body fluxes of respective temperatures normalized to the @xmath12 magnitude .",
    "we are aware that the black body flux will overestimate the white dwarf flux in the mid - ir , however , a flux excess in channel 1 and 2 due to a substellar object near the white dwarf would be recognizable in any case .",
    "no excess flux was found for any observed white dwarf in any irac channel . as an example",
    "we show the results for a da and a dq white dwarf from our sample in fig .  3 .      in the 2004 and the 2006 observations",
    "the position of the white dwarf and its putative companion were measured relative to a @xmath109 away faint ( @xmath13 ) source detected at both epochs , most probably a field star . whereas the apparent motion of the white dwarf with respect to that object is consistent with its known proper - motion , the nearby object does not show any significant relative motion relative to the latter ( fig .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is not physically related to the white dwarf .",
    "furthermore , its spectrum is not consistent with it being a very cool object .",
    "using available telescopes and focal instruments for infrared observations from ground and space , several surveys for planets around white dwarfs were performed .",
    "kilic et al .",
    "@xcite , who observed 18 cool white dwarfs , as well as farihi et al .",
    "@xcite who performed a proper motion and flux excess survey of 261 white dwarfs , did not find any evidence for brown dwarfs or planets .",
    "debes et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who included the result from our hyades observation ( friedrich et al .",
    "@xcite ) , concluded that the upper limit for planets with masses higher than @xmath14 at separations larger than 23 au is about 7% .",
    "so we can ask : where are the planets ?",
    "first of all , it must be said that the number of white dwarfs in surveys sensitive to planetary mass objects , although of the order of 100 , is still small and that surveys are still sensitivity limited such that @xmath15 planets can not be detected .",
    "nevertheless it appears that either massive jupiter - like planets in wide orbits around 34 m@xmath16 main sequence progenitor stars are not common , that planets do not survive the post - main sequence evolution or that massive jupiter - like planets do not remain bound due to planet - planet perturbations ( debes & sigurdsson @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to thank r. napiwotzki for making his white dwarf data available to us and r.d .",
    "scholz for perfoming an accurate determination of the proper - motion of the field white dwarf wd1847@xmath17223j .",
