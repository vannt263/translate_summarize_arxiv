    "the notion of wave packets is intimately connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics itself . despite of their importance during the initial stages of the development of quantum theory @xcite , this concept has been quickly overturned by the powerful and elegant operator formalism . only during the past decade interest in wave packets",
    "has emerged again , primarily triggered by the widespread availability of ultrafast femtosecond laser pulse techniques @xcite .",
    "wave packets are by today a standard tool employed to explain many different features in chemistry and physics , e.g. , chemical reaction dynamics @xcite , oscillatory motion of a coherent bose - einstein condensate @xcite , highly - excited rydberg states in atoms @xcite , or electron - hole excitations in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the concept of wave packets is sometimes applied to rationalize experimental data even though the reaction occurs under condensed - phase conditions , where the relevant reaction coordinate ( e.g. , describing the nuclear motion ) of the wave packet ( `` system '' ) may be strongly coupled to other modes ( `` environment '' or `` bath '' ) . at this point one may ask whether it makes sense to use a wave - packet description for the reaction coordinate dynamics even if strong coupling to solvent modes is present . first , the description of the wave packet in terms of a wavefunction is moot , and one has to use the reduced density matrix .",
    "second , the bath leads to a damping of the wave packet and could cause the complete loss of coherence . in that case , the use of wave packets would be rather restricted .",
    "it is one of the purposes of this paper to clarify to what extent the wave - packet concept is applicable in the presence of strong system - bath coupling .",
    "the dissipation acting on the wave packet can have many different microscopic origins . in gas - phase reactions ,",
    "one typically has rather weak damping due to coupling to the vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field ( spontaneous emission ) , or due to collisions with other molecules .",
    "in contrast , dissipation can become decisive in condensed - phase reactions where one has strong coupling of the system to solvent or protein polarization modes .",
    "considering previous theoretical treatments of gas - phase reactions , dissipation was mostly ignored or at best incorporated within the framework of the bloch equations @xcite or the redfield equations @xcite , where the latter allow to retain memory effects .",
    "however , as such an approach relies on perturbation theory in the system - bath coupling , its application to condensed - phase reactions characterized by strong system - bath coupling remains questionable .",
    "other methods are based on classical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations @xcite or projection operator techniques @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the problem of dissipative wave - packet motion is theoretically quite demanding . in this paper",
    ", we treat a simple model introduced in sections [ gauss ] and [ theory ] but put particular emphasis on the effects due to different initial states of the system arising in pump - probe spectroscopy experiments .",
    "this issue is shown to be important for a correct description of experimental data on systems in a condensed - phase environment .",
    "more specifically , one might be tempted to assume a certain initial preparation which is named `` factorized preparation '' henceforth . under the factorized preparation",
    ", the density matrix at @xmath0 factorizes into a system part describing the wave packet , and a part corresponding to the solvent modes .",
    "the wave packet at @xmath0 could then correspond to a pure state , e.g. , a gaussian wave packet . here",
    "we provide a comparison of the factorized preparation to the more realistic `` correlated preparation '' which takes into account initial system - bath correlations @xcite .",
    "we stress that such preparation effects can not be captured by standard `` dissipative wave - packet '' approaches @xcite , which implicitely use the factorized preparation .",

    "in fact , for @xmath83 , the dynamics is always fully coherent , @xmath84 . in that limit ,",
    "the bath is too slow to cause relaxational behavior .",
    "it is noteworthy that the precise value of @xmath76 depends on the quantity considered in defining coherence .",
    "taking the disappearance of the inelastic peaks in the spectral function as the relevant criterion leads to a critical value that is smaller by a factor @xmath85 @xcite . since our coherence criterion is based    = 0.8    on the oscillatory behavior of @xmath54 , where the latter equals the corresponding expression for a point - like particle , the coherent - to - incoherent transition occurs at the same damping strength @xmath76 for a wave packet and a point - like particle .",

    "the system under study is the photosynthetic reaction center in purple bacteria . in recent pump - probe experiments on modified and wild - type reaction centers , vos _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have observed oscillations in the time - resolved emission signal , which were interpreted to reflect coherent nuclear motion in the excited electronic state ( `` vibrational coherence '' ) .",

    "clearly , a nuclear coordinate within a macromolecule like the reaction center could be drastically influenced by dissipation , which suggests a treatment similar to the one discussed above .",
    "the situation that vos _",

    "the excited state surface was found to be parabolic with a curvature of @xmath94 .",
    "it was populated with a 870 nm pump pulse , say , at time @xmath0 , and probed with pulses around 921.5 nm , corresponding to the minimum of the excited state surface . in this section ,",
    "we expand on the above analysis in order to describe the emission signal .",
    "thereby effects of the spectral density characteristics and of the initial correlations can be captured , where especially the latter are missed by any simpler formalism . in order to clearly show these initial correlation effects",
    ", we shall crudely simplify the modelling of the pump ( and to a lesser extent of the probe ) pulse .",
    "in particular , we    = 0.8    make the ( strictly speaking unphysical ) assumption that the pump pulse transfers the complete nuclear wave packet up to the excited state surface .",
    "therefore we only have to treat the dissipative excited state dynamics up to the probe pulse .",
    "of course , thereby potentially important effects like the impulsive resonance raman contribution @xcite are missed . however , in principle our theory can straightforwardly be extended to provide a more realistic modelling of the pump and probe processes .",

    "@xcite did not maintain their full intensity over the whole pulse duration , we have chosen a smaller duration of @xmath111 fs .",

    "[ fig4 ] then yields @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath120 . at this point ,",
    "little is known about microscopic details of the dissipation acting on the reaction coordinate @xmath2 . in principle , one should first compute the appropriate spectral density for the system under consideration by means of md simulations @xcite . in the absence of such information",
    ", we make the assumption of an ohmic bath with a drude cutoff , see eq .",
    "( [ drudes ] ) .",
    "this spectral density was shown to be in agreement with the overall structure of the spectral density coupling to the primary electron transfer step in the reaction center @xcite . to account for the lack of knowledge concerning the spectral density , we have studied two different spectral parameter sets .",

    "again , two very different initial preparations are conceivable .",
    "the first one is to assume a wave packet in the usual sense , where the oscillator is initially in a pure state without correlations with the bath .",
    "this is the `` factorized preparation '' elaborated in sec .",
    "[ theory ] and ( at least implicitely ) employed in most previous treatments . on the other hand , the nuclear coordinate already experiences the environment while the system is in the ground state , and therefore the initial density matrix does not factorize .",
    "a more realistic preparation is to take the @xmath97 oscillator at equilibrium with the same bath as in the excited state , whence there will be system - bath correlations at @xmath0 ( `` correlated preparation '' ) .",
    "we mention in passing that the correlated preparation is related to the initial bath preparation discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of electron transfer reactions .",
    "the special case @xmath127 with @xmath128 has also been treated in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    due to its very short duration , as a result of the pump pulse at @xmath0 , the system is assumed to suddenly change from the ground state to the excited state surface .",
    "this amounts to both a vertical shift and a change in curvature @xmath129 , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . technically speaking",
    ", the correlated preparation can be most conveniently accounted for by following the path - integral analysis of ref.@xcite , but keeping different system potentials acting on the imaginary - time and real - time paths .",

    "the initial width @xmath131 was chosen as the thermal width @xmath132 in the ground state oscillator .",
    "importantly , despite of having the same initial value , the time - dependence of the variance is strikingly different depending on the initial condition .",
    "this becomes particularly evident for @xmath133 , where for the correlated preparation , @xmath33 and @xmath75^{2 } ( t ) \\rangle$ ] stay constant in time , whereas the factorized preparation _",

    "after the pump pulse at @xmath0 , the system is assumed to be in the excited state surface according to a properly chosen initial preparation . the probe pulse is then assumed to be much faster than typical solvent time scales such that the environmental influence can be neglected during the emission process itself .",

    "apart    = 0.8    = 0.8 +    = 0.8    = 0.8    from the decay of the oscillations in @xmath138 , damping of the nuclear motion is also reflected in a finite amplitude @xmath165 at the minimum . for wavelengths @xmath152 away from the turning points or the bottom ,",
    "there are two different time intervals between subsequent passings of the transition region .",
    "this leads to the splitting of the maxima in the short - time emission signal observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    with increasing temperature , according to our argumentation above",
    ", the influence of the initial preparation should become more and more important .",
    "this is seen in the temperature dependence of the spectrum and of the emission signal shown in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , respectively .",
    "we first focus on the effects seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . the minimum of @xmath153 shifts towards higher wavelengths with increasing temperature .",
    "this can be rationalized by noting that for @xmath166 , the energy gap between the @xmath167th vibronic eigenstates of the excited and ground state decreases with @xmath167 , and that high - order eigenstates become more important in the spectral decomposition of @xmath1 at    = 0.8    = 0.8    higher temperatures .",
    "in fact , additional calculations for @xmath168 [ not shown here ] yield a similar shift towards smaller @xmath152 .",
    "this shift is more pronounced for the correlated initial preparation , but depends only weakly on the spectral density of the environmental modes .",
    "figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the emission signal at @xmath169  nm , corresponding to @xmath170 , with @xmath2 approaching the bottom @xmath171 as the temperature is increased .",
    "furthermore , figure 8 shows that @xmath33 under the factorized preparation experiences a phase shift of almost @xmath163 at @xmath172  k compared to the correlated preparation .",
    "such an unphysical phase shift arises as a relict of the unperturbed evolution of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath173 increases with temperature , a negative initial slope results under the factorized preparation , see eq .",
    "( [ sigma_entwicklung ] ) .",
    "notably , for the correlated preparation , the maxima in @xmath138 stay always close to the equilibrium values , in marked contrast to the factorized preparation but in accordance with the experimental data of ref .",
    "a similar behavior is seen in the variance shown in fig .",
    "for the correlated preparation , the maxima in @xmath33 occur every @xmath174th period , corresponding to the passing of the bottom @xmath116 , and they are very close to their equilibrium value @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , for the correlated preparation , the independent expectation values @xmath21 and @xmath33 are always close to their equilibrium values when passing the bottom @xmath116 . on the other hand , for the factorized preparation , the phase shift in @xmath33 results in a bunching of the wave packet when passing the bottom .",
    "this causes even qualitatively different emission signals .",
    "we conclude that at high temperatures several unphysical effects are introduced by using a factorized initial preparation , and a wrong description of the emission spectrum may result .",
    "= 0.84 +    = 0.8",
    "in this work , we have formulated a dissipative wave - packet approach towards a detailed theoretical description of stimulated emission pump - probe experiments under condensed - phase conditions .",
    "assuming harmonic surfaces for both the ground and the excited state , the gaussian nature of the wave packet describing the coherent nuclear motion allows for an exact treatment even if strong damping by environmental modes is present . modelling the environmental modes by a set of infinitely many effective harmonic oscillators with a suitably chosen spectral density , it is then possible to make detailed predictions for the stimulated emission signal and for the corresponding spectra .",
    "while the spectral density is in principle accessible in terms of md simulations , we have studied two model spectral densities in this work .",
    "a particular advantage of our approach is the possibility of treating different initial preparations of the wavepacket - plus - bath complex directly after the pump pulse ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "a more realistic calculation should also explicitely study the pump pulse , which can in principle be done along the same lines .",
    "under such a formalism , a correct choice for the initial preparation of the wavepacket - plus - bath complex before the pump pulse will be important and is expected to lead to similar effects .",
    "the recent experiments by vos _",
    "@xcite on the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center have been analyzed using this formalism .",
    "due to our assumptions about the pump pulse , the possibly important impulsive resonant raman contribution was not taken into account here .",
    "while some of the qualitative features of the coherent nuclear motion have been discussed before using simpler arguments @xcite , our approach can allow for a fully quantum - mechanical comparison of experimental data with theory . even in the absence of detailed knowledge about the environmental spectral density",
    ", conclusions of relevance to the interpretation of experimental results can be extracted from our analysis . in particular , we have shown that at high temperatures , the assumption of a factorized initial state leads to large differences from the theoretical predictions under a more realistic correlated initial state .    finally it should be stressed that the approach presented here can be applied to other pump - probe spectroscopy setups as well . in particular , if the excited state surface is weakly coupled to another surface , as happens , e.g. , in the primary electron transfer step in the reaction center , transitions to this surface are expected to modify the emission signal .",
    "a theoretical description of such a situation can be given in terms of spin - boson type models @xcite and will be elaborated elsewhere .",
