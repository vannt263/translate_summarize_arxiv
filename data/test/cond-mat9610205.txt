    "it has been shown , however , that the derivation of the resistivity within the framework of bkt theory is at best only valid in a narrow temperature range , which is probably inaccessible experimentally.@xcite thus , most of our experimental knowledge about vortex pair fluctuations is based on measurements of the temperature dependence of just one quantity .",
    "alternative approaches would be very welcome .",
    "apart from the renormalized interaction and the correlation length , bkt - type theories also predict the temperature- and size - dependent fugacity of pairs , and , consequently , the distribution of pair sizes and the total pair density  at least below the transition temperature . a generalized approach@xcite yields quantitative results even above @xmath6 .",

    "we have shown that flux noise measurements can yield information about the size distribution of vortex - antivortex pairs and on vortex dynamics , and can be used as an additional probe for a bkt transition .",
