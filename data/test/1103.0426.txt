    "groups of galaxies contain most of galaxies in the universe and are the link between individual galaxies and large - scale structures ( e.g. , huchra & geller 1982 ; geller & huchra 1983 ; nolthenius & white 1987 ; ramella et al .",
    "the dissipationless evolution of these systems is dominated by gravity .",
    "interactions over a relaxation time tend to distribute the velocities of the galaxy members in a gaussian distribution ( e.g. bird & beers 1993 ) .",
    "thus , a way to access the dynamical stage of galaxy groups is to study their velocity distributions .",
    "evolved systems are supposed to have gaussian velocity distributions , while those with deviations from normality are understood as less evolved systems .",
    "hou et al . (",
    "2009 ) have examined three goodness - of - fit tests ( anderson - darling , kolmogorov and @xmath1 tests ) to find which statistical tool is best able to distinguish between relaxed and non - relaxed galaxy groups .",
    "using monte carlo simulations and a sample of groups selected from the cnoc2 , they found that the anderson - darling ( ad ) test is far more reliable at detecting real departures from normality in small samples .",
    "their results show that gaussian and non - gaussian groups present distinct velocity dispersion profiles , suggesting that discrimination of groups according to their velocity distributions may be a promising way to access the dynamics of galaxy systems .",
    "recently , ribeiro , lopes & trevisan ( 2010 ) extended up this kind of analysis to the outermost edge of groups to probe regions where galaxy systems might not be in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "they found significant segregation effects after splitting up the sample in gaussian and non - gaussian systems . in the present work ,",
    "we try to further understand the nature of non - gaussian groups .",
    "in particular , we investigate the problem of mass estimation for this class of objects , and their behaviour in the phase space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present data and methodology ; section 3 contains a statistical analysis with sample tests and multimodality diagnostics for non - gaussian groups ; finally , in section 4 we summarize and discuss our findings .",
    "we use a subset of the 2pigg catalog , corresponding to groups located in areas of at least 80% redshift coverage in 2df data out to 10 times the radius of the systems , roughly estimated from the projected harmonic mean ( eke et al .",
    "the idea of working with such large areas is to probe the effect of secondary infall onto groups .",
    "members and interlopers were redefined after the identification of gaps in the redshift distribution according to the technique described by lopes et al .",
    "finally , a virial analysis is perfomed to estimate the groups properties .",
    "see details in lopes et al .",
    "( 2009a ) ; ribeiro et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ; and ribeiro , lopes & trevisan ( 2010 ) .",
    "we have classified the groups after applying the ad test to their galaxy velocity distributions ( see hou et al .",
    "2009 for a good description of the test ) .",
    "this is done for different distances , producing the following ratios of non - gaussian groups : 6% ( @xmath2 ) , 9% ( @xmath3 ) , and 16% ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "we assume this latter ratio ( equivalent to 9 systems ) as the correct if one desires to extending up the analysis to the regions where galaxy groups might not be in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "approximately 90% of all galaxies in the sample",
    "have distances @xmath6 .",
    "this is the natural cutoff in space we have made in this work .",
    "some properties of galaxy groups are presented in table 1 , where non - gaussian groups are identified with an asterisk .",
    "cosmology is defined by @xmath7 = 0.3 , @xmath8 = 0.7 , and @xmath9 distance - dependent quantities are calculated using @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the two sample statistical problem for the gaussian ( g ) and ng ( non - gaussian ) subsamples .",
    "we choose the mass resulting from the virial analysis as the property to illustrate the comparison between the subsamples .",
    "both kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) and cramer - von mises ( cvm ) tests reject the hypothesis that the ng subsample is distributed as the g subsample , with p - values 0.00001 and 0.00029 , respectively .",
    "for these tests , we have used 1000 bootstrap replicas of each subsample to alleviate the small sample effect .",
    "the result indicates an inconsistency between the mass distributions of g and ng groups .",
    "this could represent a real physical difference or , more probably , an indication of a significant bias to higher masses in ng groups .",
    "the median mass for this subsample is @xmath11 , while it is @xmath12 for the g subsample , thus @xmath13 is larger by a factor of @xmath14 . in the following , we investigate this mass bias looking for features in the velocity distributions of galaxy groups .",
    "the shape of velocity distributions may reveal a signature of the dynamical stage of galaxy groups .",
    "for instance , systems with heavier tails than predicted by a normal parent distribution may be contamined by interlopers . otherwise , systems with lighter tails than a normal may be multimodal , consisting of overlapping distinct populations ( e.g. bird & beers 1993 ) .",
    "we now try to understand the mass bias in the ng subsample by studying non - gaussianity in the velocity distributions . since we have carefully removed interlopers from each field ( see section 2.1 ; and lopes et al .",
    "2009a ) , we consider here that the most probable cause of normality deviations in our sample is due to a superposition of modes in the phase space ( e.g. diemand & kuhlen 2008 ) .",
    "visual inspection of radial velocity histograms of ng systems suggests that multipeaks really happen in most cases ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we statistically check multimodality by assuming the velocity distributions as gaussian mixtures with unknown number of components .",
    "we use the dirichlet process mixture ( dpm ) model to study the velocity distributions .",
    "the dpm model is a bayesian nonparametric methodology that relies on markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations for exploring mixture models with an unknown number of components ( diebolt & robert 1994 ) .",
    "it was first formalised in ferguson ( 1973 ) for general bayesian statistical modeling .",
    "the dpm is a distribution over @xmath15-dimensional discrete distributions , so each draw from a dirichlet process is itself a distribution . here , we assume that a galaxy group is a set of @xmath15 components , @xmath16 , with galaxy velocities distributed according to gaussian distributions with mean and variance unknown . in this framework , the numbers @xmath17 are the mixture coefficients that are drawn from a dirichlet distribution . in the dpm model , the actual number of components @xmath15 used to model data is not fixed , and can be automatically inferred from data using the usual bayesian posterior inference framework .",
    "see neal ( 2000 ) for a survey of mcmc inference procedures for dpm models .    in this work , we find @xmath15 using the r language and environment ( r develoment core team ) under the dpmixsim library ( da silva 2009 )",
    ". the code implements mixture models with normal structure ( conjugate normal - normal dpm model ) .",
    "first , it finds the coefficients @xmath17 , and then separates the components of the mixture , according to the most probable values of @xmath17 , in the distributional space , leading to a partition of this space into regions ( da silva 2009 ) .",
    "the results can be visually analysed by plotting the estimated kernel densities for the mcmc chains . in figure 2",
    ", we show the dpm diagnostics for each group , that is , the deblended modes in the velocity distributions .",
    "we have found the following number of modes per group : 4/102 , 3/138 , 3/177 , 2/179 , 5/352 , 3/447 , 2/475 , 3/505 , 3/507 .",
    "therefore , all non - gaussian groups in our sample are multimodal ( reaching a total of 28 modes ) according to the dpm analysis .",
    "unfortunately , we can not compute the physical properties of 13 modes , due to intrinsic scattering in velocity data ( and/or to the smallness of the modes  those with less than 4 members ) .",
    "the properties of the other 15 modes are presented in table 2 .",
    "now , we perform again the statistical tests , comparing the distribution of mass in ng and g with the new sample ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "first , we compare the ng subsample and the sample of modes ( m ) .",
    "both ks and cvm tests reject the hypothesis that m is distributed as ng , with p=0.0211 and p=0.0189 , respectively .",
    "then , we compare g and m. now , the tests accept the hypothesis that m is distributed as g , with p=0.4875 and p=0.4695 . hence , the distribution of the modes deblended from non - gaussian groups are themselves mass distributed as gaussian groups . also , the median mass of the m sample is @xmath18 , a value larger than @xmath19 only by a factor @xmath20 ( before deblending groups the factor was @xmath21 2.9 ) . this consistency between g and m objects",
    "indicate that non - gaussian groups are a set of smaller systems , probably forming an aggregate out of equilibrium .",
    "indeed , groups are the link between galaxies and larger structures .",
    "thus , our results suggest we are witnessing secondary infall ( the secondary modes ) onto a previously formed ( or still forming ) galaxy system ( the principal mode ) .",
    "naturally , we can not discard the possibility of ng groups being unbound systems of smaller groups seen in projection , although the properties of the independent modes are quite similar to those found in physically bound groups .",
    "we have classified galaxy systems after applying the ad normality test to their velocity distributions up to the outermost edge of the groups . the purpose was to to investigate regions where galaxy systems might not be in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "we have studied 57 galaxy groups selected from the 2pigg catalog ( eke et al .",
    "2004 ) using 2df data out to @xmath22 .",
    "this means we probe galaxy distributions near to the turnaround radius , thus probably taking into account all members in the infall pattern around the groups ( e.g. rines & diaferio 2006 ; cupani , mezzetti & mardirossian 2008 ) .",
    "the corresponding velocity fields depend on the local density of matter .",
    "high density regions should drive the formation of virialized objects , whereas low density environments are more likely to present streaming motions , i.e. , galaxies falling toward larger potential wells constantly increasing the amplitude of their clustering strength ( e.g. diaferio & geller 1997 ) .",
    "we have found that 84% of the sample is composed of systems with gaussian velocity distributions .",
    "these systems could result from the collapse and virialization of high density regions with not significant secondary infall .",
    "they could be groups surrounded by well organized infalling motions , possibly reaching virialization at larger radii .",
    "theoretically , in regions outside @xmath0 , we should apply the non - stationary jeans formalism , leading us to the virial theorem with some correction terms .",
    "these are due to the infall velocity gradient along the radial coordinate and to the acceleration of the mass accretion process ( see cupani 2008 ) .",
    "their contribution is likely to be generally negligible in the halo core where the matter is set to virial equilibrium and to become significant in the halo outskirts where the matter is still accreting ( see e.g. cupani , mezzetti & mardirossian 2008 ) .",
    "however , a slow and well organized infalling motion to the center of the groups could diminish the importance of the correction terms , i.e. , the systems could be in a quasi - stationary state outside @xmath0 .",
    "the high fraction of groups immersed in such surroundings suggests that ordered infalling motion around galaxy groups might happen quite frequently in the universe .    in any case",
    ", gaussian groups can be considered as dynamically more evolved systems ( see ribeiro , lopes & trevisan 2010 ) .",
    "the remaining 16% of the sample is composed of non - gaussian groups .",
    "we found that these sytems have masses significantly larger than gaussian groups .",
    "this biasing effect in virial masses is basically due to the higher velocity dispersions in ng groups .",
    "ribeiro , lopes & trevisan ( 2010 ) found that ng groups have rising velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "a similar result was found by hou et al .",
    "rising velocity dispersion profiles could be related to the higher fraction of blue galaxies in the outskirts of some galaxy systems ( see ribeiro , lopes & trevisan 2010 ; and popesso et al . 2007 ) .    at the same time",
    ", the ng subsample is composed of multipeak objects , identified by the dpm model analysis applied to the velocity space .",
    "these results indicate that secondary infall might be biasing the mass estimates of these groups .",
    "thus , the ng systems could result from the collapse of less dense regions with significant secondary infall input .",
    "contrary to gaussian groups , the surroundings of ng systems do not seem to be in a quasi - stationary state .",
    "they are dynamically complex .",
    "actually , we have found these groups can be modelled as assemblies of smaller units .",
    "after deblending groups into a number of individual modes , we have verified that the mass distribution of these objects is consistent with that of gaussian groups , suggesting that each unit is probably a galaxy group itself , a system formed during the streaming motion toward the potential wells of the field .    .",
    "radial velocities are subtracted from the median velocity and divided by the velocity dispersion of the groups.,width=317 ]    our results reinforce the idea of ng systems as complex structures in the phase space out to @xmath22 .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in figure 4 , where we show the stacked g and ng groups , and the stacked modes .",
    "galaxies in these composite groups have distances and line - of - sight velocities with respect to the centers normalized by @xmath0 and @xmath23 , respectively . in the upper box ,",
    "we present the g stacked group . note that galaxies are extensively concentrated in the phase space diagram , with a single density peak near to 0.5@xmath0 , revealing a well organized system around this point .",
    "also , note that the density peak has @xmath24 .",
    "contour density lines suggest that ordered shells of matter are moving toward the center .",
    "a different result is found for the ng stacked group . in the middle box of figure 4",
    ", we see a less concentrated galaxy distribution , with less tight density contour levels , presenting a density peak slightly larger than @xmath0 , and two additional peaks , around 2@xmath0 , possibly interacting with the central mode .",
    "the additional peaks are not aligned at @xmath24 , suggesting a less symmetrical galaxy distribution in the phase space .",
    "these features suggest that non - gaussian systems are distinct , and dynamically younger than gaussian groups , which agrees well with the results of ribeiro , lopes & trevisan ( 2010 ) .",
    "also in figure 4 , we present the modes stacked system in the lower box .",
    "similar to the gaussian case , we have a single peak in the phase space , near to 1.5@xmath0 .",
    "galaxy distribution however is still less symmetrical than in gaussian groups , with the peak not aligned at @xmath24 .",
    "this suggests that , although more organized than ng systems , modes are probabably dynamically distinct and younger than gaussian groups as well .",
    "our work points out the importance of studying ng systems both to possibly correct their mass estimates and multiplicity functions , as well as to better understand galaxy clustering at group scale .",
    "understanding of these objects is also relevant for cosmological studies using groups and clusters through the evolution of the mass function ( voit 2005 ) .",
    "using systems with overestimated properties may lead to a larger scatter in the mass calibration ( lopes et al .",
    "2009b ) and could also affect the mass function estimate ( voit 2005 ) .",
