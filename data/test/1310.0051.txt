    "strongly - correlated electron systems are currently of great interest in the condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry communities . @xcite despite the differences , for example , between frustrated lattices and chemical bond breaking , the strong - correlation phenomenon in these systems has similar roots which are manifested by the breakdown of the mean - field picture .",
    "regardless of the details of the problem at hand , strong - correlation has significant impact on many important aspects of the physics of various systems and can not be ignored .",
    "@xcite a low computational cost , qualitatively correct description of strongly - correlated materials would have great impact on the quality of theoretical predictions .",
    "hence , the quest for developing novel , as well as improving existing approaches for strong - correlation continues unabated .",
    "one of the reasons that robust methods for the treatment of strong - correlation are so elusive is related to the size of the systems of current interest . with increasing number of electronic degrees of freedom ,",
    "the numerical complexity of exactly solving the problem quickly becomes prohibitively large ; approximate methods must be therefore employed .",
    "an ideal approximation should provide a systematic and qualitatively correct description that is computationally accessible and does not deteriorate with system size .",
    "such an ideal tool would be therefore applicable to a broad range of problems . from a practical point of view",
    ", approximate methods should offer a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost .",
    "many methods are available to tackle the strong - correlation problem ; they include quantum and variational monte carlo , @xcite dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , @xcite density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , methods based on symmetry breaking and restoration , @xcite and methods based on a gutzwiller variational approach .",
    "@xcite this list is not , by any means , exhaustive .",
    "the effort to develop new approximations is continuously undertaken .",
    "recently , knizia and chan introduced density matrix embedding theory ( dmet ) , @xcite a novel and promising tool as demonstrated by the high quality results obtained on hubbard lattices .",
    "dmet has its roots in the embedding dmft framework , where the complexity of the entire system is reduced by partitioning the problem into a fragment plus an entangled bath .",
    "together , they constitute an impurity model .",
    "as opposed to dmft , the dmet impurity model is frequency - independent and therefore significantly simpler .",
    "@xcite dmet is designed to reproduce the entanglement of the impurity rather than its green s function .",
    "moreover , the construction of the effective bath is achieved in an algebraic way . in particular ,",
    "if the impurity hamiltonian is defined in a basis derived from a product state , the complexity of the impurity basis construction amounts to a rather small matrix diagonalization .",
    "@xcite    density matrix embedding theory has been benchmarked for model 1d and 2d one - band hubbard lattices , @xcite and in chemical systems .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we focus on the former in order to further investigate the properties of this novel methodology .",
    "in particular , we analyze the convergence criterion employed in the initial study .",
    "@xcite we follow the alternative criterion , introduced in ref . and prove that in periodic systems it allows us to gain full control over the lattice filling .",
    "additionally , we investigate the impact of the effective bath basis on the quality of results .",
    "the formalism here presented allows for spin symmetry breaking in the underlying lattice mean - field solution that is used to construct the key ingredients of the dmet procedure .",
    "the only symmetry constraint retained is lattice translational symmetry , although in the present work we understand it in an extended cell formalism .",
    "this means that the adopted translational unit cell is identical to the dmet fragment for which the calculations are performed .",
    "we also suggest an approximation that substantially reduces the number of parameters to be optimized .",
    "in particular , we show that it is sufficient to limit the density matrix fitting to diagonal elements , i.e. , we propose , what we call _ density _ , as opposed to _ density matrix _ embedding . we provide a detailed numerical analysis of the results obtained with this approach .",
    "in particular , we benchmark the aforementioned approximation against high quality reference data and exact solutions for energies , two - body correlation functions , and compressibility .",
    "the latter allows us to access the mott gap in the hubbard model . @xcite",
    "the present section is organized as follows .",
    "first , for clarity and to make this work self - contained , we review the basic principles of dmet .",
    "we discuss the properties of the embedding basis and sketch the algorithm .",
    "we then proceed to discuss the convergence criterion , which is by no means unique .",
    "the suggested route to incorporate broken symmetry embedding is described subsequently .      in order to outline the key ideas of dmet ,",
    "let us assume that we are given the exact ground state @xmath0 for the system of interest .",
    "then , it is possible to perform a schmidt decomposition of this wavefunction according to @xcite @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be chosen such that the former represents a particular set of lattice site states , which we call the fragment .",
    "the latter must then be the complement that spans all the sites excluded from @xmath3 , and we refer to it as the bath .",
    "the summation in the above equation is limited by the dimension of the smaller of these two sets .",
    "these bases are then used to project the hamiltonian into the schmidt states of the fragment , @xmath3 , and bath , @xmath2 @xcite @xmath4 details of matrix elements of the projected hamiltonian , usually refer to as impurity hamiltonian , are not relevant here . for a discussion regarding the impurity hamiltonian ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref . .",
    "the key point to notice is that the size of the new basis ( though many - body in principle ) can be chosen much smaller than that of the original problem , if formulated in a single particle basis . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the original hamiltonian @xmath5 and the impurity hamiltonian @xmath6 share the same ground state @xmath0 ; information about the expectation values of @xmath5 can be extracted by studying @xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , in practical applications , we do not have access to the exact solution .",
    "the embedding states have to be approximated .",
    "the fundamental simplification of dmet is to replace the exact solution with a mean - field ( here understood as hartree - fock ) wavefunction , which is a simple product wavefunction ansatz . in this case",
    ", the schmidt fragment and bath bases can be represented in terms of single particle states .",
    "this greatly simplifies the computational treatment of the impurity problem and , as we show in this section , provides an effective truncation of the dimension of single particle basis for the problem at hand .",
    "let us follow the procedure more closely on a specific example , a hubbard hamiltonian . in this case ,",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 connects nearest neighbors , @xmath9 is the on - site repulsion parameter , and @xmath10 is an effective one - body potential that we wish to introduce ; the rationale behind this potential will become apparent in the following . at this point ,",
    "let us just notice that @xmath10 is contained within the fragment and it is periodically replicated over the lattice . in the limit of vanishing potential @xmath10 , the hamiltonian reduces to the standard hubbard model .",
    "the first step in dmet is to solve the above problem at the mean - field level .",
    "this procedure yields a single slater determinant @xmath11 , where @xmath12 creates a hole ( occupied ) state @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a bare vacuum .",
    "the product runs from 1 to the number of electrons .",
    "the hole creation operators are defined by the underlying hartree - fock transformation @xmath15 from physical fermions @xmath16 , @xcite @xmath17 the basis @xmath18 takes into account the position and the spin degrees of freedom . in order to construct the fragment and bath states needed to define the impurity hamiltonian",
    ", we introduce the operator @xmath19 that projects the hole levels onto the single particle basis contained within the fragment .",
    "additionally , we have the complement @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the identity operator .",
    "following ref . , one can define an overlap matrix @xmath23 , @xmath24 where the indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 run over hole states .",
    "this hermitian matrix can be brought to diagonal form by a unitary transformation @xmath27 satisfying @xmath28 , where @xmath29 contains at most @xmath30 nonzero eigenvalues ( here @xmath31 is the number of electrons in the lattice whereas @xmath32 is the size of the single particle fragment basis ) . in the following",
    ", we will assume that @xmath33 and that all @xmath32 eigenvalues are different from 1 and 0 ( otherwise , special care has to be taken while constructing the fragment and bath states ) .",
    "for each of the nonzero eigenvalues , one may construct a fragment state latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{fstate }    and a bath state latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{bstate }    the single particle states that correspond to vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath23 are considered as the inert core states @xmath35 . following ref .",
    ", the states corresponding to vanishing eigenvalues of @xmath23 denote orbitals with zero probability of being in the fragment space .",
    "similarly , one can think of the inert core states as states with vanishing coupling to the fragment states in the mean - field one - particle density matrix .",
    "the reader is referred to appendix [ ap : idem ] for more details .    in dmet ,",
    "the inert core single particle states are eliminated from the impurity problem ( _ i.e. _ they are not included while projecting the hamiltonian onto the impurity hamiltonian ) .",
    "therefore , dmet retains only a small portion of the large number of single particle states constituting the original hilbert space of the problem .",
    "in fact , the total dimension of the single particle basis is just twice the dimension of the single particle basis spanned by the fragment .",
    "this is clear from the particular properties of the spectrum of @xmath23 ( eq . [ mmat ] ) for the mean - field wavefunction . in other words ,",
    "the hilbert space of the impurity model is significantly smaller than that of the original problem .",
    "it is also determined by the size of the fragment .",
    "armed with fragment and bath single particle states , which we shall refer to as an embedding basis , one can construct an impurity hamiltonian ( henceforth , for brevity of notation , the indices in the impurity hamiltonian denote spin and space coordinates ) , @xmath36 in the above , @xmath37 denotes bath creation operators whereas @xmath38 denotes either fragment or bath ones .",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the one- and ( antisymmetrized ) two - body terms of the hubbard hamiltonian projected onto the embedding basis , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xmath41 corresponds to the additional effective potential . at this point",
    ", we would like to point out that this potential , introduced in eq .",
    "[ eq : hubham ] , does not affect directly the one - body part of the impurity hamiltonian in the fragment space .",
    "in other words , the fragment part of the impurity hamiltonian corresponds to the physical hamiltonian .",
    "as the reader may notice , the dmet impurity hamiltonian derived from the schmidt decomposition of the mean - field wavefunction is expressed in terms of single particle states and corresponding creation and annihilation operators of fragment and bath states .",
    "this is to be compared with eq .",
    "[ eq : trueimp ] , which is more general and may include many - body states as a basis .",
    "the impurity hamiltonian is the central part of the approximation . as the dimension of the embedding basis",
    "is significantly reduced ( by means of eliminating the inert core @xmath35 states ) , one is now in a position to employ powerful ground state computational schemes for solving it . in particular ,",
    "exact diagonalization becomes computationally feasible for modest fragment sizes .",
    "the goal of dmet is to find an optimal effective one - body potential @xmath10 by means of minimizing @xmath42 in the above , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the one - particle density matrix evaluated with the impurity and the mean - field wavefunction , respectively .",
    "the precise meaning of the convergence criterion is discussed in the following section",
    ".    once converged , the energy density @xmath45 for the fragment can be evaluated as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the two particle density matrix .",
    "the index @xmath48 in the above summations implies that at least one of the basis functions has to belong to the fragment space .",
    "clearly , the energy expression does not correspond to the expectation value taken with respect to the full lattice hamiltonian . because the above expression is not a true expectation value taken with respect to the full hamiltonian of the system , the dmet energy need",
    "not be an upper bound to the exact value . in practice ,",
    "we have observed a tendency of the procedure to deliver ground state energies that are below the exact ones .",
    "the self consistency loop in dmet takes the following form    1 .",
    "obtain an initial guess for @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   find @xmath15 of eq .",
    "[ hartreefock ] and construct fragment and bath states according to eqs .",
    "[ mmat]-[bstate ] .",
    "3 .   construct the impurity hamiltonian ( eq . [ impham ] ) and solve it .",
    "4 .   update @xmath10 by means of eq .",
    "[ diffgam ] .",
    "if the update is not negligible , replicate the fragment potential @xmath10 over the entire lattice and go to step 2 .",
    "dmet provides a very good compromise between accuracy and computational cost for the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite however , in the original formulation , the authors chose to define a convergence criterion based on an effective one - body potential that minimizes the difference between the correlated and mean - field one - particle density matrices over the _ full _ impurity space , _ i.e. _ , fragment and bath basis . in other words ,",
    "the effective potential sought satisfies @xmath49 where the indices @xmath50 and @xmath51 run over the fragment and the bath states .",
    "this approach , despite its merits , introduces a certain limitation to the model .",
    "primarily , as shown in appendix [ ap : idem ] , because the mean - field density matrix in the embedding basis must be idempotent , it is not possible to find @xmath10 such that the fit between the mean - field ( @xmath44 ) and correlated one - particle density matrix ( @xmath43 ) is exact .",
    "an accurate impurity solver yields @xmath43 with eigenvalues different from 1 and 0 , except for special cases , like for example , a trivial system of noninteracting particles .",
    "one therefore concludes that in general @xmath52 , the total energies for the physical system computed with dmet are determined by the fragment energy .",
    "it follows then , that any error in the average number of particles in the fragment affects the predictions for the entire system .",
    "this problem can be ameliorated by changing the definition of the converged effective one - body potential .",
    "an alternative convergence criterion can be therefore formulated,@xcite @xmath53 henceforth , the block of the density matrix in the embedding basis with two indices located on the fragment is referred to as fragment one - particle density matrix . with",
    "the above definition of the effective potential , provided that the minimum corresponds to a perfect match , the average number of electrons per fragment is correct .",
    "this statement is particularly important from the viewpoint of periodic systems , where the average particle density per fragment is known .",
    "the proof of this statement is presented in appendix [ ap : filling ] .",
    "the above considerations narrow the choices for the convergence criterion due to the constraint on the number of particles per fragment .",
    "nonetheless , fitting only the fragment one - particle density matrix is not a unique choice .",
    "for this reason , our density embedding proposal further simplifies the numerical procedure while imposing control over the lattice filling . as shown in appendix",
    "[ ap : filling ] , an exact match between density matrices guarantees that the trace of fragment @xmath43 will have the desired number of particles .",
    "since the trace is obviously determined by the diagonal elements of the one - body density matrix , we formulate the convergence criterion as @xmath54 the decrease in the number of parameters that needs to be optimized is accompanied by simplifications of the effective lattice hamiltonian that one should solve , @xmath55 we find that eq .",
    "[ eq : dmetcondiag ] greatly facilitates convergence while delivering results quantitatively similar to those obtained with the full method .",
    "for the purpose of the present work , we shall denote the results obtained with the convergence criterion defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : dmetcondiag ] as density embedding theory ( det ) . in this approach ,",
    "the effective potential has a clear physical meaning as an effective ( site dependent ) chemical potential .",
    "having discussed the convergence criterion in dmet , let us turn our attention to possibilities for optimizing the embedding basis .",
    "the initial dmet calculations neglected the effect of two - body interactions in the lattice .",
    "@xcite in other words , the two - body interactions were suppressed both in the lattice hamiltonian and bath portions of the impurity hamiltonian . only particles in the fragment states were subjected to the on - site repulsion . since in mean - field",
    "the entire system is approximated by a set of non - interacting particles , the hartree - fock transformation constitutes the exact solution ; no symmetry breaking can occur , with some exceptions ( here we do not consider explicit symmetry breaking _ via _ an effective potential symmetry by a spin dependent effective potential introduced in eq .",
    "[ eq : hubham ] . this is a possible route for further developments of the model . ] ) .",
    "for example , due to lattice discretization into a set of fragments , translational symmetry might be violated ; this , however , would again correspond to a situation where one works in an extended unit cell framework .",
    "another possibility is degeneracy of the solution where the wavefunction may be chosen to violate certain symmetries of the hamiltonian .    in the present work ,",
    "we adopt a different procedure .",
    "the full lattice hamiltonian corresponds exactly , apart from the effective one - body potential whose role has been already discussed , to the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the system is then treated with a spin - unrestricted formalism , where the hartree - fock wavefunction need not be an eigenfunction of the @xmath56 operator .",
    "this procedure leads to a spin - dependent embedding basis and an impurity hamiltonian that does not need to commute with the @xmath56 operator . in order to retain the simplicity of a spin - restricted formulation , we do not choose the effective one - body potential to be spin - dependent .",
    "as a direct consequence , we define the effective one - body potential by @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the charge density .",
    "the fitted one - particle density matrix may be chosen either as dmet or det type .",
    "on the other hand , we note that the broken spin symmetry formalism does not easily support fitting of the entire one - particle density matrix in the embedding basis as was done in ref . .",
    "let us first stress that the transformation of the bare fermion basis to the embedding basis is a projection and hence can not be inverted ( unless , of course , one chooses to divide the whole system into two equal fragments ) .",
    "only the transformation of the fragment states is unitary ( and hence invertible ) .",
    "therefore , solely the @xmath59 and @xmath60 fragment density matrices are expressible in the common basis that defines a charge density matrix . for this reason",
    ", fitting of the entire one - particle density matrix has no clear physical meaning , though it may be numerically performed .",
    "we stress that the arguments outlined above regarding correct filling are directly applicable to the charge density matrix . indeed , in a spin - restricted formalism ,",
    "the charge density matrix and the one - particle density matrix are equivalent",
    ".    finally , let us note that away from half - filling , the spin unrestricted mean - field solution can admit charge fluctuations that are beyond the size of the fragment . in order to maintain the mean - field calculations commensurate with the chosen fragment size , we solve the hartree - fock equations in momentum space assuming homogeneity of the fragment superlattice .",
    "in the following sections , we benchmark all the embedding schemes discussed above for the 1d hubbard model . for clarity , let us define acronyms that will be used in the rest of this paper .",
    "results labeled as ba correspond to the exact bethe ansatz solution .",
    "@xcite calculations denoted as dmet(n ) refer to calculations where spin symmetry ( @xmath56 ) in the mean - field solution is allowed to break and fitting of the one - particle density matrix is performed over the entire fragment chosen to include n sites .",
    "similarly , det(n ) denotes calculations where the fit is enforced only on the diagonal elements of the fragment one - particle density matrix . in order to better illustrate the performance of the broken symmetry approach",
    ", we also include data obtained with embeddings where the two - body interaction is suppressed in the lattice .",
    "to be more precise , in these schemes the hamiltonian for which the mean - field solution is obtained corresponds to eq .",
    "[ eq : hubham ] with @xmath61 , however , the impurity hamiltonian does include the on - site interaction but only in the fragment space .",
    "these , as already discussed , correspond to a non - interacting case and are denoted as ni and ni@xmath62 .",
    "the additional subscript @xmath63 ( for `` full '' matrix ) implies fitting of the full impurity one - particle density matrix ( this is the method introduced in ref . ) . for convenience , table [ methods ]",

    "spin symmetry denotes whether the mean - field solution is required to be an eigenstate of the @xmath56 operator . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have investigated several dmet variants within a broken spin - symmetry formalism which includes two - body interactions in the lattice mean - field .",
    "we have shown that the numerical procedure can be simplified and its convergence greatly improved by only fitting the diagonal of the fragment density matrix .",
    "the resulting det scheme here introduced shows satisfactory accuracy in hubbard 1d benchmarks .",
    "additionally , we have demonstrated that the det scheme is exact when the half - filled hubbard lattice is split into two equal pieces .",
    "we deem this property an important guiding principle for defining a robust embedding approximation .",
    "our numerical det data for half - filled lattices is in very good agreement with exact results obtained with the bethe ansatz .",
    "this is clear not only for total energies but also for the two - body local correlation function @xmath64 .    for hole doped systems ,",
    "det yields good mott gaps and density profiles",
    ". moreover , det retains full control over the average number of particles , as opposed to the original formulation of ref . .",
    "both procedures have comparable computational cost except that inclusion of lattice two - body interactions requires an iterative procedure for solving the mean - field hamiltonian .",
    "as currently formulated , dmet can not accurately describe long - range correlation functions beyond the fragment size ( or , in other words , provide an accurate description of fluctuations beyond the size of the fragment ) .",
    "this is an expected shortcoming inherent to approximations defining an impurity model that is shared by dmft .",
    "we believe that this deficiency constitutes a major challenge in the development of dmet",
    ".    further work to improve and address the many shortcomings discussed in this paper seems warranted .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that dmet is a valuable and promising quantum embedding tool for studying strongly - correlated systems , offering high quality results at very low computational cost .",
