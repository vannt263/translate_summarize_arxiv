    "roughly 100 years after its systematic microscopic interpretation the origin of thermodynamics is still under dispute ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is , however , an empirical fact that macroscopic systems behave according to the laws of thermodynamics and are routinely viewed as large quantum systems .",
    "consequently , already in the early formulations of quantum mechanics @xcite the question about the relationship between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics arose and is still discussed today .",
    "a central point in the discussion is the reconciliation of unitary quantum dynamics ( featuring no fixed point ) with the equilibrating , rate equation - type dynamics of non - equilibrium thermodynamics ( featuring a fixed point ) . in this debate various concepts",
    "have been introduced such as `` typicality '' @xcite , `` pure state quantum statistical mechanics '' @xcite `` eigenstate thermalization hypothesis '' @xcite , `` thermal environment coupling '' @xcite , and many more .",
    "recently , experiments in an optical lattice with ultra - cold atoms have been performed to study the relaxation dynamics in an interacting many - body system @xcite .",
    "also the thermalization dynamics itself , beyond the mere existence of equilibrium , has gained attention : fokker - planck equations for some closed finite quantum systems have been suggested @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a quantum model corresponding to the archetypical thermodynamic scenario in which two ( equal or similar ) macroscopic bodies are prepared at , e.g. , different temperatures ( possibly a hot and a cold coffee mug ) and then brought into contact but kept isolated from any environment .",
    "( similar scenarios have been analyzed using quantum models in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . ) experimental evidence shows that the dynamics of the temperature difference ( here called @xmath0 ) is autonomous and markovian in the sense that it may be described as @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the rate of change .",
    "this implies that the dynamics of the temperature difference @xmath0 possesses a unique , attractive fixed point , is free of memory effects and is not affected by any other variables .",
    "if the temperature difference is in some sense a statistical quantity then its variance @xmath3 is expected to be small compared to the overall scale of its expectation value @xmath4 , a property referred to as macroscopic determinism . in terms of the coffee mugs this means that one may repeat the experiment several times without getting measurably different results for @xmath0 during its evolution .",
    "the quantum model we consider is a finite , anisotropic heisenberg spin - ladder of size @xmath5 described by the hamiltonian ( @xmath6 throughout this paper ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the spin-1/2 operators , @xmath11 is the coupling strength along the beams of the ladder ( labeled by @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 is the coupling strength along the rungs .",
    "the observable which is our analogon to the temperature difference mentioned in the example of the two coffee mugs is the difference of magnetization along the z - axis between the two beams which we call @xmath14 throughout the paper @xmath15 note that in the model described by eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) the total magnetization along the z - axis @xmath16 of the entire system is a conserved quantity .",
    "hence , for our analysis we choose the largest total magnetization subspace @xmath17 . within this subspace",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath14 are @xmath18 .",
    "the multiplicities are essentially binomially distributed , @xmath19 features the largest degeneracy .    in ref .",
    "@xcite this model has been analyzed for @xmath20 by means of exact diagonalization .",
    "reasonable agreement of the quantum dynamics of @xmath0 with a fokker - planck equation was found numerically for a small set of initial states all of which are in a sense close to equilibrium . furthermore the respective fokker - planck equation has been `` derived '' from an appropriate projection operator technique ( up to leading order ) under the assumption of equal correlation times for the transition dynamics between all @xmath21-subspaces . in order to investigate the claim that this finite quantum model would yield irreversible markovian @xmath0-dynamics for all practical purposes ,",
    "we numerically analyze the same model class in the paper at hand but for larger systems and a much wider range of initial states .",
    "we essentially find that , while indeed autonomous markovian , deterministic @xmath0-dynamics emerges in general , specific predictions of the fokker - planck model suggested in @xcite fail for initial states further away from equilibrium . rather than to vanish",
    ", this failure appears to become even more pronounced for larger systems .",
    "thus , below we present an alternative analysis based on typicality rather than on projection operator techniques which at least predicts specific equilibrium values correctly while being methodically sound .",
    "in this paper we focus on spin systems .",
    "relaxation in closed quantum systems is , however , not limited to spin systems , for an example of a bosonic system , see , e.g. , ref . @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , in the present paper we address larger systems and a larger variety of different pure , rather than mixed , initial states . to those ends",
    "we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) numerically by means of the chebyshev polynomial algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm yields results that are very accurate ( close to machine precision ) , independent of the time step used  @xcite .",
    "conserved quantities such as the total energy and magnetization are constant to almost machine precision ( about 14 digits in our calculations ) .",
    "computer memory severely limits the sizes of the quantum spin systems which can be simulated . to represent the state @xmath22 of @xmath5 spin-@xmath23 particles on a digital computer ,",
    "we need a least @xmath24 bytes . in practice",
    ", we need several of such vectors , memory for communication buffers , local variables and the code itself .",
    "for example , for @xmath25 we need about 320 gb of memory . although the cpu time required to solve the tdse also increases exponentially with the number of spins , this increase can be compensated for by distributing the calculations over many processors . for a @xmath25 system , solving the tdse upto @xmath26 using 65536 cpus takes about 6 hours on the jlich ibm bluegene / q .",
    "details of the massively parallel simulation code are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to account for the initial state independence as described in the introduction ,",
    "we draw pure states essentially at random , only tailored to feature probability distributions with respect to @xmath0 and energy that are narrow compared to the overall range of possible values for the respective observables . from the numerics it turns out that the narrow energy distribution is crucial for the expected dynamics to emerge . if the initial states are drawn from a larger energy window the equilibrium variances @xmath27 exhibit a strong dependence on the initial state which is obviously in conflict with the concept of a thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "our understanding of this phenomenon is not conclusive yet , we however expect that its occurrence strongly depends on the degree to which the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is fulfilled .",
    "we intend to discuss this thoroughly in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the initial states @xmath28 are constructed as follows .",
    "we begin with the states @xmath29 , where the set of states @xmath30 denotes the complete basis set of states in the spin - up  spin - down representation and the coefficients @xmath31 are obtained by generating uniform independent random numbers in the interval @xmath32 $ ] and rescaling them such that @xmath33 .",
    "we then project the initial state to the `` @xmath17-and - specific-@xmath21-subspace '' and in order to narrow down the energy distribution ( in this case around @xmath34 ) we eventually apply a pertinent exponential @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the projector onto a subspace featuring a certain eigenvalue of @xmath14 , @xmath37 being the projector on the @xmath17 subspace and @xmath38 denoting a constant chosen such that the variance of the energy @xmath39 for the initial states @xmath40 is small ( @xmath41 is used throughout this paper for the reasons explained above ) .",
    "@xmath42 is just a normalization constant . to compute @xmath43",
    "the same chebyshev polynomial algorithm is used as for the time evolution .",
    "of course , using this algorithm the energy window can also be located at positions other than @xmath34 . in this paper , however , we choose @xmath34 since it appears to be the most promising choice for the emergence of thermodynamical behavior : in this model @xmath34 is in the center of the full energy spectrum and features the largest density of states .",
    "furthermore @xmath34 would also be the energy expectation value of a hypothetical gibbs equilibrium state with infinite temperature .",
    "so in this respect the choice @xmath34 corresponds to a high temperature limit .",
    "the case of @xmath44 closer to the ground state energy , i.e. , lower temperatures is left as an interesting subject for further investigation .",
    "as a first result we find that initial states with the same @xmath45 and @xmath38 but generated from different random @xmath46 show approximately the same dynamics of , e.g. , mean @xmath47 and variance @xmath48 .",
    "this was also found and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath20 .",
    "however , for @xmath25 this becomes so pronounced that the respective graphs can not be discriminated by the naked eye .",
    "therefore , in what follows we only present results for initial states generated from one random @xmath46 .",
    "this finding may be viewed as a manifestation of the concept of dynamical typicality @xcite and is in accord with results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next we turn towards an overall picture of the @xmath0-dynamics in this model .",
    "[ fig : fancy ] shows the dynamics of the probabilities @xmath49 for two initial states with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , for @xmath25 .     for spin - ladders of size @xmath25 for two different essentially random initial states with @xmath50 ( red line ) and @xmath51 ( blue line ) .",
    "the two probability distributions hardly overlap at @xmath52 and almost coincide at later times.,width=264,height=188 ]    obviously the unitary dynamics yields after some time essentially constant probabilities @xmath53 which coincide for both initial states while they hardly overlap at @xmath52 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a strong indication for thermodynamic behaviour in this spin system . to analyze this",
    "further we focus on the dynamics of the magnetization difference @xmath54 and its variance @xmath48 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been argued that the @xmath0 dynamics of the model could be captured by a markovian master equation derived from a simple stochastic spin - flip model .",
    "the transition rates between neighboring @xmath0-subspaces read @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes an overall time constant .",
    "master equations with rates ( [ rates ] ) necessarily yield autonomous dynamics .",
    "the @xmath0-dynamics as resulting from the schrdinger equation and from the above master equation are compared to each other for two different initial states for @xmath20 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : n16 ] . while the agreement for the initial state close to equilibrium is quite good ( @xmath57 ) the stochastic model ( [ rates ] ) fails to predict the dynamics for states starting far from equilibrium ( @xmath58 ) . in ref .  @xcite it was suggested that this failure may vanish for larger system sizes . with the work at hand we are able to address such larger system sizes .",
    "data equivalent to fig .",
    "[ fig : n16 ] but now for @xmath25 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : n32 ] .",
    "obviously the agreement for initial states close to equilibrium ( @xmath57 ) becomes even better but the failure for substantially off - equilibrium initial states ( @xmath59 ) remains .",
    "since the agreement of ( [ rates ] ) with the true quantum dynamics does not improve for off - equilibrium states with increasing system size the crucial question remains whether the true quantum dynamics may nevertheless be considered in accord with macroscopically deterministic , irreversible , markovian behavior of @xmath60 for larger @xmath5 .    in order to address this question we compute @xmath54 for various @xmath61 for @xmath25 and display the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean32 ] .",
    "the curves are shifted in time such that the squares of the deviations of the curves from one another are minimized .",
    "if the dynamics was fully autonomous and markovian , the curves would lie exactly on top of each other .",
    "apparently , this is to good accuracy the case for all initial states , regardless of the failure of ( [ rates ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : var32 ] the variances @xmath62 are displayed for the same initial states . although the master equation based on ( [ rates ] ) does not describe the dynamics correctly , all variances appear to converge to the same value .",
    "this finding is also in accord with markovian irreversible behavior .    how can this `` irreversible '' tendency of the variances corresponding to so many pure , different initial states towards one constant `` equilibrium '' value be explained although the description in terms of the master equation defined by ( [ rates ] ) fails ?",
    "an explanation may be provided by the concept of typicality .",
    "the equilibrium value coincides with the typical variance @xmath63 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : var32 ] .",
    "the latter is the `` generic '' variance of a random initial state which is unrestricted with respect to @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) : within the addressed energy shell there are certainly states featuring variances ranging from @xmath66 to @xmath67",
    ". however , as shown in the context of typicality , states featuring a certain variance @xmath63 are by far the most frequent ones , with respect to the unitary invariant measure @xcite .",
    "therefore they are sometimes called `` typical states '' . while all considered initial states start in a very tiny region of hilbert space formed by `` non - typical '' states , some states venture out into the extremely large region formed by the typical states , while other initial states do not such as , e.g. , the initial state coresponding to @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rate32 ] .",
    "its variance @xmath62 remains significantly above the typical variance .",
    "however , the corresponding data for @xmath25 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : var32 ] indicate that the relative amount of states that does reach the typical region essentially increases up to @xmath69 rather quickly with system size .    :",
    "( @xmath70 ) , average over all addressed final variances as displayed , e.g. , in figs .",

    "[ fig : rate32 ] , [ fig : var32 ] .",
    "solid lines are linear fits to the typical variances ( red ) and the early maxima ( blue ) .",
    "the coincidence of the mean variances with the typical variances is very good for larger @xmath5 .",
    "all quantities appear to scale linearly with system size , the early maxima are above the mean final variances by a constant shift of @xmath73,width=264,height=188 ]    next we address the question how the final variances and their maxima ( as visible , e.g. , in fig .  [ fig : var32 ] ) scale with the system size . since the predictability of the quantum dynamics by ( [ rates ] ) does not fully hold this scaling is crucial for the claim that this model shows irreversible , macroscopically deterministic behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ fig : varvsn ] the mean of the final variances averaged over all discussed initial states , the typical variances and the largest maxima of the variances are shown for @xmath74 .",
    "these maxima occur before the eventual values are reached and are most pronounced for the respective most `` off - equilibrium '' initial states , i.e. , the states with the largest @xmath75 , cf .",
    "[ fig : rate32 ] , [ fig : var32 ] .",
    "these early , most pronounced maxima appear to be above the final variances by a finite shift of @xmath73 for all system sizes as may be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : varvsn ] . figure [ fig : varvsn ] also indicates that , at least for @xmath76 , the final variances agree very well with the typical variances as already mentioned above .",
    "it is also clearly seen that all displayed quantities scale linearly with the system size and feature the same slope .",
    "the above findings may be summarized and interpreted as follows : figure [ fig : mean32 ] strongly indicates that the expectation value of the magnetization difference @xmath0 shows autonomous and markovian dynamics .",
    "figure [ fig : var32 ] indicates that its variances may go through early maxima but eventually tightly cluster around the typical variance .",
    "figure [ fig : varvsn ] indicates that throughout the dynamics the standard deviations @xmath77 of the magnetization difference essentially scale as @xmath78 . since the maximum @xmath64 scales linearily with the system size as @xmath5 this means that the standard deviation will vanish compared to the overall scale of the expectation values with increasing system size .",
    "therefore the specifications for thermodynamic behaviour given in the introduction ( autonomous and markovian dynamics for the expectation value and negligible variances on the scale defined by the expectation values ) are met for this system .",
    "considering the correspondence with macroscopic thermodynamic properties the question comes to mind whether the dynamics of @xmath64 and @xmath79 can be effectively described by a ( discrete ) markov chain on the magnetization difference subspaces , regardless of the failure of the model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for larger @xmath80 . as already pointed out in the above discussion of figs .",
    "[ fig : n16 ] , [ fig : n32 ] this markov chain should be similar to the model defined by ( [ rates ] ) close to equilibrium but should significantly deviate from the latter for transitions between subspaces with larger @xmath80 . in a sense , which is described in more detail below",
    ", this markov chain can be expected to be comparable to a fokker - planck equation . moreover , due to the autonomy of the dynamics of @xmath54 this markov chain must correspond to a fokker - planck equation with a drift or force term , the curvature of which is negligible on the scale of @xmath77 .",
    "the existence of such a markov chain would imply the validity of what van kampen called the `` assumption of repeated randomness '' @xcite for this specific system ( it may be worth noting here that van kampen and others built their explanation of the second law on this assumption . ) .",
    "thus , in order to check whether such a markov chain exists and to find its concrete form we compute the finite transition probabilities @xmath81 between all subspaces according to : @xmath82 if such a description applies , the dynamics of the probabilities should be given by @xmath83 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 represents the entity of all @xmath86 as a vector , and @xmath87 is the transition matrix formed by all @xmath88 . from @xmath85 the mean and variance may be computed as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the vector formed by all @xmath91 and @xmath92 the vector formed by all @xmath93 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stocuni ] we compare the dynamics of mean and variance as resulting from the unitary evolution to the dynamics as resulting from ( [ trans ] , [ iter ] ) for @xmath94 ( this choice is not imperative , however for @xmath95 on the timescale of the correlation time the agreement becomes worse ) .",
    "obviously there is reasonable agreement even for states starting far from equilibrium .",
    "this indicates that a markov chain based on @xmath87 may indeed essentially capture the dynamics of the closed quantum system . in order to compare the markov chain defined by ( [ iter ] ) to the master equation defined by ( [ rates ] ) we first compute a matrix of finite transition probabilities @xmath96 as resulting from ( [ rates ] )",
    "this is conveniently done numerically .",
    "since we intend to compare with @xmath97 of course we compute also @xmath98 . in order to be able to compare @xmath99 in a meaningful way we assign to both transition",
    "matrices a `` force '' @xmath100 and a `` diffusion coefficient '' @xmath101 in the following way : we compute the change of the mean @xmath102 during time @xmath103 given that one started with @xmath104 , we call that @xmath100 .",
    "furthermore we compute the increase of the variance @xmath62 during time @xmath103 given that one started with @xmath105 , we call that @xmath101 .",
    "the results for the forces and the diffusion coefficients are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcdif ]    obviously there is a good agreement for the force and reasonable agreement for the diffusion coefficient as calculated from the markov chain ( [ trans ] ) and the spin - flip model ( [ rates ] ) close to equilibrium ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "however there are also significant differences in the off - equilibrium regime .",
    "based on the numerics at hand we did not find any tendency of these differences to vanish in the limit of larger systems .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that a finite quantum system may show thermodynamic behaviour in the sense of macroscopically deterministic , autonomous , markovian relaxation of an observable for a very large class of pure initial states .",
    "while this behavior gets more pronounced under upscaling it is already visible for a system comprising @xmath106 spins .",
    "although being in a well - defined sense markovian , the above relaxation dynamics is not in full accord with the naive model presented in ref .",
    "however , this finding nonetheless supports the view of irreversible , stochastic dynamics of selected observables emerging directly from quantum mechanics .",
    "of course this emergence of thermodynamical relaxation directly leads to the quest for a sensible definition of entropy in this context . since ( regardless of the failure of the fokker - planck based model in ref .",
    "@xcite the dynamics is found to be in accord with a specific markov chain ) such a notion could be provided by the concept of stochastic thermodynamics as described , e.g. , in refs @xcite .",
