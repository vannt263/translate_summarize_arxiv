    "the problem of detecting the symmetries of a curve has been studied extensively , mainly because of its applications in pattern recognition , computer graphics and computer vision .    in pattern recognition ,",
    "a common problem is how to choose , from a database of curves , the one which best suits a given object , represented by means of an equation @xcite .",
    "before a comparison can be carried out , one must bring the shape that needs to be identified into a canonical position .",
    "thus it becomes necessary to compute the symmetries of the studied curve . in this context",
    ", the computation of symmetries has been addressed using splines @xcite , by means of differential invariants @xcite , using a complex representation of the implicit equation of the curve @xcite , and using moments @xcite .    in computer graphics ,",
    "the detection of symmetries and similarities is important , both in the 2d and the 3d case , to gain understanding when analyzing pictures , and also in order to perform tasks like compression , shape editing or shape completion .",
    "many techniques involve statistical methods and , in particular , clustering ; see for example the papers @xcite , where the technique of transformation voting is used .",
    "other techniques are robust auto - alignment @xcite , spherical harmonic analysis @xcite , primitive fitting @xcite , and spectral analysis @xcite , to quote a few .    in computer vision ,",
    "symmetry is important for object detection and recognition . in this context",
    ", an analysis has been carried out using the extended gauss image @xcite and using feature points @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are algorithms for computing the symmetries of 2d and 3d discrete objects @xcite and for boundary - representation models @xcite .    in the case of discrete objects ( polygons , polyhedra )",
    ", the symmetries can be determined exactly @xcite .",
    "this can be generalized to the case of more complicated shapes whose geometry is described by a discrete object , as done in @xcite , where an efficient algorithm is provided .",
    "examples of this situation appear with bzier curves and tensor product surfaces , where the shape follows from the geometry of the control points .",
    "however , in almost all of the other above references , the goal is to find _ approximate _ symmetries of the shape .",
    "this is perfectly adequate in many applications , because the input is often a ` fuzzy ' shape , with missing or occluded parts in some cases .",
    "in fact , even if the input is exact , it is often an approximate , simplified model of a real object .",
    "here we shall consider a different perspective .",
    "we assume that our input is exact , and we want to deterministically detect the existence and nature of its symmetries , without converting to implicit form .",
    "more precisely , our input will be either a plane or a space curve @xmath0 defined by means of a rational parametrization with integer coefficients .",
    "our goal is to ( 1 ) determine whether @xmath0 has any symmetries , and ( 2 ) determine all symmetries in the affirmative case .",
    "notice that since we are dealing with a _",
    "object , i.e. , the whole curve @xmath0 , we do not have a control polygon from which the geometry of the curve , and in particular its symmetries , can be derived .",
    "this could be the case if we were addressing a piece of @xmath0 , at least when @xmath0 admits a polynomial parametrization .",
    "in that situation , @xmath0 could be brought into bzier form , and then an algorithm like @xcite could be applied .",
    "in fact , in that case the algorithm of @xcite would be computationally more effective than ours , since essentially the analysis follows from a discrete object . however , this idea is no longer applicable when the whole curve is considered .",
    "additionally , an analysis of _ approximate _ symmetries of rational curves could be attempted by sampling points on the curve , and then applying algorithms like @xcite . in that case",
    ", the question is how to choose suitable zones for sampling , which amounts to collecting some information on the shape of the curve @xcite .",
    "a natural strategy is to look for notable points on the curve , like singularities , inflection points or vertices : since any symmetry maps notable points of a certain nature to the same kind of points or leaves them invariant , one might sample around these points .",
    "one thus obtains clusters of points that must be compared .",
    "there would be various possibilities for comparing these clusters , depending on the kind of symmetry one is looking for , all which should be explored .",
    "still , this approach only leads to an approximate estimate on the existence of symmetries , which is a different problem than the one considered in this paper .",
    "up to our knowledge , the deterministic problem for whole curves has only been solved in the case of implicit plane curves @xcite and in the case of polynomially parametrized plane curves @xcite .",
    "the case of space curves seems absent from the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide an elegant method to detect rotation symmetry of an implicitly defined algebraic curve , and efficiently find the exact rotation angle and rotation center .",
    "the method uses a complex representation @xmath1 of the curve .",
    "some cases not treated in @xcite are completed in @xcite , where similar ideas are applied to detect mirror symmetry . in contrast",
    ", our method applies directly to the parametrization , which is the most common representation in cagd , avoiding the conversion into implicit form .",
    "the approach in @xcite is similar to ours , although it should be noted that restricting to polynomial parametrizations yields an advantage for solving the problem fast and efficiently .",
    "the main ingredient in our method is the underlying relation between two parametrizations of a curve that are _ proper _ , i.e. , injective except perhaps for finitely many values of the parameter .",
    "essentially , whenever a symmetry is present , this symmetry induces an alternative parametrization of the curve .",
    "furthermore , if the starting parametrization is proper , this second parametrization is also proper .",
    "since two proper parametrizations of a same curve are related by means of a mbius transformation @xcite , we can reduce the problem to finding this transformation .",
    "thus , _ involutions _ , i.e. , symmetries with respect to a point , line or plane , can be detected and determined for plane and space curves . for rotations , we need one more ingredient : a formulation in terms of complex numbers for plane curves , or the pythagorean - hodograph assumption for space curves . in practice , our methods boil down to computing greatest common divisors and finding real roots of univariate polynomials , which are tasks that can be performed efficiently .",
    "throughout the paper we shall consider a rational curve @xmath2 , where @xmath3 or @xmath4 , neither a line nor a circle , defined by means of a proper rational parametrization @xmath5 where @xmath6,\\qquad \\gcd(p_i , q_i ) = 1,\\qquad i=1,\\ldots , n.\\ ] ] here `` @xmath7 '' refers to the greatest common divisor . since @xmath0 is rational , it is irreducible .",
    "one can check whether a parametrization of a plane curve is proper , and every rational plane curve can be properly reparametrized without extending the ground field .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough study on properness and a proof of these claims , and see @xcite for similar results for rational space curves .",

    "in particular @xmath14 .",

    "the identity map @xmath17 of @xmath8 is called the _ trivial symmetry_. an isometry @xmath18 of @xmath8 is called an _ involution _ if @xmath19 , in which case @xmath20 is the identity matrix and @xmath21 .",
    "the nontrivial isometries of the euclidean plane are classified into reflections , rotations , translations , and glide reflections .",
    "the special case of _ central symmetries _ is of particular interest and corresponds to a rotation by an angle  @xmath22 .",
    "central and mirror symmetries are involutions .",
    "the classification of the nontrivial isometries of euclidean space again includes reflections ( in a plane ) , rotations ( about an axis ) , and translations , and these combine in commutative pairs to form twists , glide reflections , and rotatory reflections .",
    "composing three reflections in mutually perpendicular planes through a point @xmath23 , yields a _ central inversion _ with center @xmath23 , i.e. , a symmetry with respect to the point @xmath23 .",
    "the special case of rotation by an angle @xmath22 is again of special interest , and it is called an _ axial symmetry_. central inversions , reflections , and axial symmetries are involutions",
