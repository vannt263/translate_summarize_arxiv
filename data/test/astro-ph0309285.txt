    "bl lac objects are one of the several flavors of radio loud active galactic nuclei . along with peculiar properties at other wavelengths ( lack of strong emission lines , high levels of variability , optical polarization up to 3% , detection at x - ray and @xmath0-ray energies ) , they also show quite extreme behavior in the radio : the parsec - scale structure is dominated by a compact , flat - spectrum core , from which a one - sided jet emerges , showing knots of enhanced brightness . when monitored over long intervals ,",
    "these components are often found to be in motion , sometimes with an apparently superluminal velocity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the currently accepted explanation for these properties is found in the frame of unified models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these models are based on a dust enshrouded super - massive black hole accreting matter in a disk , from which two symmetric collimated jets of relativistic plasma are ejected in opposite directions .",
    "when the angle between the jet axis and the line of sight is small , the resulting doppler boosting accounts for many of the above - mentioned properties .",
    "a source such as markarian 501 ( b1652 + 39 ) is an ideal target to test the assumptions involved in unified models . at its low redshift ( @xmath1)kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ] , 1mas  =  0.72pc ; therefore , the milliarcsecond resolution achievable with vlbi techniques makes it possible to investigate in great detail the regions near the central core .",
    "furthermore , mkn  501 is one of the few sources with a clear limb - brightened structure @xcite .",
    "finally , this source is very well studied at other frequencies and it is known for its x@xmath4 and @xmath5ray @xcite activity , which also sets constraints on the parameters describing the physics of the inner jet ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in this paper we present a large multi - epoch , multi - frequency data - set of vlbi images ; new observations as well as previously published data are used to study the physical properties of this source .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the pc - scale jet morphology , velocity and orientation .",
    "additionally , our data - set allows us to compare images obtained at different frequencies with similar resolutions and thus to perform spectral index such that @xmath6 studies for comparison with the total intensity images .",
    "in  [ sec : observations ] we describe the previous and new observations used in this paper , along with the data reduction methods and procedures for component fitting and spectral index mapping .",
    "results are presented in  [ sec : results ] and discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "table 1 summarizes all observations considered in this paper , listing epoch , frequency , total observing time and array used .",
    "the notes provide references for details .",
    "the present data - set is very similar to the one used by edwards & piner ( 2002 , hereafter @xcite ) to discuss the proper motion in mkn 501 : we did not use the 1995 oct 17 epoch ( due to its low sensitivity ) , or the 1996 jul 10 and 1998 oct 30 epochs ( as better data from other nearby epochs was available ) . on the other hand",
    ", we add 3 more epochs ( see note 4 to table 1 ) at 15 and 22ghz and we consider two new space vlbi ( vsop ) observations obtained on 2001 march 5 and 6 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "images from some of the previous observations have been published or made available to the scientific community on open web sites . however , for the sake of completeness and homogeneity , we requested and obtained the calibrated ( @xmath7)-data for all observations presented here .",
    "after the initial reduction ( see notes to table  1 for references ) , we imported the calibrated data into the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and inspected them carefully .",
    "then , we produced new images ; one or more self - calibration cycles proved to be useful in some cases , providing a better signal to noise ratio .",
    "we adopted the appropriate ( @xmath7)-range , weights , cell - size and angular resolution to map the spectral index and to look for proper motion of the jet substructures ; we present parameters of final images in table  3 .",
    "we obtained space vlbi images at three different epochs : 1997.8 , 1998.4 , and 2001.3 .",
    "vsop ( vlbi space observatory programme ) observations combine data from ground arrays , such as the vlba , and the 8 m orbiting antenna on board the satellite halca . for the latter two epochs observations at 1.6 and 4.8ghz were performed on successive days to minimize flux density variability problems in spectral index mapping .",
    "the first space vlbi observation was conducted at 1.6ghz only .",
    "further details on these observations are given in table  2 .",
    "the standard vsop observing mode has one polarization ( lcp ) and two ifs of 16 mhz each with two - bit sampled data . the lowest if failed in the 1.6ghz observation in 1997 . in 2001 ,",
    "the `` a priori '' calibration was affected by lack of system temperature measurement for robledo and goldstone .",
    "a mini - cal procedure was done before starting the experiment in robledo , providing a value of 20k that was assumed as constant . for halca",
    ", we used the nominal system temperatures of 75k and 77k for the two ifs at 1.6ghz , and 88k and 92k for those at 4.8ghz @xcite .",
    "all the data were correlated in socorro and then imported and reduced in aips .",
    "global fringe - fitting returned good solutions for all the observations in which large ground telescopes were used , although no solutions were found for the last observation ( 2001 mar 6 ) , unless a value of snr as low as 4.5 was set in the fit . in spite of such a low signal to noise ratio",
    ", we found these solutions reasonable : delays and rates found in this way do not present any discontinuity or suspicious behavior .",
    "thus , we applied these solutions and proceeded with the whole array .",
    "we then performed self calibration using clean - component models , first in phase and , afterward , in both phase and amplitude . in the latter",
    ", we repeated the task several times , increasing the baseline range .",
    "this revealed to be of great importance for those observations where gain information for some antennas was missing .",
    "for example , we could self - calibrate the shortest space - ground baselines using ` uniform weight ' ground - only images ; in fact , we have similar baselines both in the ground array and to halca , as provided by its highly elliptical orbit ( see fig .",
    "[ uv1 ] , [ uv2 ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig3 ]  [ fig9 ] present all the images , in order of decreasing angular resolution .",
    "identification of components is usually the most difficult problem affecting proper motion studies .",
    "long time intervals between epochs can lead to misidentification of components ; moreover , the use of different resolutions can cause confusion , for example by blending components with different properties and velocities ; finally , registering images at different observing frequencies is also necessary : the apparent core shift due to the different spectral index of the core and jet can be significant .    in the present work ,",
    "the time coverage is very dense ( 14 epochs over 4 years , plus the final vsop observation ) and there are no large time gaps . to prevent angular resolution problems , we produced maps at the same resolution at all epochs . even if some observations allowed a better resolution , we convolved all the images obtained at a frequency 5ghz@xmath815ghz with a circular restoring beam of 1.2mas fwhm",
    "however , higher resolution maps have also been made , in order to provide more information when needed .",
    "in particular we obtained images at a resolution of 0.6 @xmath9 0.9 mas ( ra @xmath9 dec ) in all observations with good @xmath10-coverage on long baselines ( see table  3 ) .",
    "a comparison of fit components in convolved and full resolution images revealed good agreement .",
    "the fit to the components of the jet was done within aips and the difmap package .",
    "in aips we used the task ` jmfit ` , which allows one to fit gaussian components to part of an image . up to",
    "four components can be used at a time and the task , starting from given initial conditions , solves in an iterative way for position , flux density and extension of each component . since more than four components are needed to properly fit the images , we had to run the task several times on different regions .",
    "the regions were made to overlap with each other in order to obtain results compatible with previously published models .",
    "we also repeated the fit looking for `` stable '' solutions , i.e. , changing our initial guesses or even leaving them blank .",
    "eventually , very good models were obtained ; the difference in flux density between our fits and the images is always smaller than 5% .    using difmap",
    ", we also carried out model - fitting to the visibilities rather than the image . similarly to the fits made in aips , four to six jet components were required in addition to the core to provide a good representation of the data .",
    "when producing spectral index images , there are three main effects that have to be carefully taken into account .",
    "first , because of flux density variability and possible proper motion of components , the observations must be taken at very close epochs .",
    "next , the angular resolution must be the same at both frequencies and the @xmath10-coverage as similar as possible ; this guarantees the same sensitivity to extended structures in the high and low frequency images . finally , as absolute position",
    "is not available , we need to properly align the images before combining them .    to meet the first two requirements , we produced spectral index images using data separated by less than 24hrs .",
    "we considered 15 and 22ghz data obtained on the same day ( 1997 aug 15 ) and space vlbi observations at 1.6 and 5ghz made on successive days ( 1998 apr 7 and 8  see * ? ? ? * for a preliminary analysis ) .",
    "we note that 1998 space vlbi observations have better @xmath10-coverage than those in 2001 ( see fig .",
    "[ uv1 ] , [ uv2 ] ) . to obtain matching @xmath10-coverages",
    ", we cut the shortest baselines from the low frequency data and the longest baselines in the high frequency observations .",
    "images were then obtained using uniform weights , and the same cell - size and restoring beam .",
    "the problem in registering the images is that the peak of the image , coincident with the core , can correspond to different positions at different frequencies if the core is self - absorbed .",
    "so , we aligned the images using the positions of components along the jet in a region with steep spectral index and no self - absorption effects .",
    "we found that at 15 and 22ghz no shift was necessary , while a shift of @xmath110.2mas was necessary in both ra and dec between the 5 and 1.6ghz images .",
    "see figures [ spix1 ]  [ spix3 ] for the final spectral index maps .",
    "the large scale radio structure has been imaged with the vla @xcite , showing a core dominated source with two - sided diffuse emission oriented at @xmath12 ; this indicates that the jets are non relativistic at a ( projected ) distance of @xmath13kpc from the core .",
    "the pc - scale structure has also been investigated , using vlbi techniques ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , with resolution of @xmath13 mas .",
    "however , the collection of multi - epoch , multi - frequency , high resolution and high sensitivity images will improve our knowledge of the source morphology and evolution .",
    "the present vlbi observations show a strong core and a one - sided jet .",
    "the jet exhibits multiple sharp bends before undergoing a last turn , followed by rapid expansion .",
    "we can distinguish three different regions :    * a first region , extending @xmath14mas from the core , where a high brightness jet structure is present ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the jet pa is not constant in this region , being 150@xmath15160@xmath15 near the core ( @xmath161mas ) and moving to @xmath17 ( from 1 to @xmath114mas from the core ) to become @xmath18 from 4 to 10mas .",
    "+ the 22ghz high resolution image ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) shows that the jet is resolved and limb - brightened starting at @xmath111mas from the core .",
    "this is confirmed by the high sensitivity 5ghz space vlbi image ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) ; although this image does not have enough angular resolution to resolve the inner jet near to the core , it shows an extended low brightness emission , confirming the transverse extension of the jet in the inner 2mas . in the region from 2 to 10mas from the core ,",
    "the limb brightened jet structure is clearly visible .",
    "+ the brightness profile along the main axis of the jet is not uniform ; high brightness regions are followed by dimmer regions . in particular at 56mas from the core a deep minimum is present just before an extended bright spot with a peak 89mas from the core .",
    "however , we do not refer to these regions as `` knots '' , since they are resolved at higher frequencies . * between @xmath1110mas and @xmath1130mas from the core",
    ", the jet loses its collimation and becomes visible only in lower resolution images ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] ) . in this region ,",
    "the jet is oriented at a pa of @xmath11 110@xmath15 and its opening angle is increasing .",
    "a well defined limb brightened structure is visible ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , in agreement with the `` layered '' structure visible in the polarized emission @xcite . as in the first region ,",
    "lower frequency images reveal a wider jet and a more evident external shear layer ; this implies that the spectra in the inner regions are flatter than in the external regions .",
    "* at @xmath1130mas from the core the jet shows strong bending and a large opening angle ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] ) . in this third region",
    "the orientation of the diffuse jet is in agreement with the orientation of the kpc - scale emission .",
    "the jet opening angle is @xmath1143@xmath15 .",
    "the radio brightness is uniform and there is no indication of the helical structure suggested by @xcite , which possibly resulted from the poor @xmath19-coverage ( five telescopes only ) of their observations .",
    "a limb - brightened structure is visible in our low resolution images up to @xmath11100mas from the core , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] .",
    "no radio emission is detected either on the opposite side of the radio core or in the position of the putative counterjet feature f reported by @xcite . however , if we compare our measured total flux densities to single dish data ( e.g. from the umrao database ) , the correlated vlbi flux density accounts only for a part of the total flux density ( @xmath20% at 5ghz and @xmath21% at 15ghz ) ; this is in agreement with the presence of a larger scale structure resolved out by the vlbi data , such as the two sided emission shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "single dish monitoring of markarian 501 shows that this source is remarkably stable in the radio band .",
    "@xcite monitored a sample of 23 @xmath5 and x@xmath4 ray loud blazars over a 4 year period ( 19962000 ) with the 32 m medicina radio telescope . from their data ,",
    "markarian 501 is the most quiescent source , with an almost flat light curve at both 5 and 8.4ghz .",
    "moreover , markarian 501 is part of the umrao database , which also shows a fairly steady flux density . during the period of our observation , the average flux densities are @xmath22jy at 4.8ghz , @xmath23jy at 8ghz and @xmath24jy at 14.5ghz .",
    "we consider the vlbi core flux density using our data at 15ghz ( 0.6@xmath90.9 mas fwhm , ra@xmath9dec ) , where we have 8 different epochs ( see table  3 ) . assuming the map peak as the core flux density , we see some dispersion in the values , which range between 360mjy ( 1997 apr 25 ) and 508mjy ( 1995 dec 15 ) .",
    "this suggests possible core variability , which is diluted in single dish observations , since the vlbi core makes up only @xmath25% of the total flux density .",
    "we note , however , that our observations are not homogeneous and were not aimed to monitor flux density variability .",
    "the overall morphology of the source does not present dramatic changes between epochs .",
    "no compact jet component ( knot ) is present in the jet at all frequencies : if we consider the highest resolution data , the local peaks present in the low resolution images become clearly resolved . therefore , we limit our study to the innermost region , where high - resolution images are available ( the jet brightness is too low to be detected at high frequency beyond 10mas from the core ) . in this region ,",
    "the jet is always transversally resolved : it appears centrally peaked at low resolution , but resolved with a limb brightened structure at high resolution .",
    "this implies that we could be mixing together different components with different properties and moving at different velocities .",
    "for all these reasons , we analysed images at the best angular resolution ( typically 0.6@xmath90.9mas , ra@xmath9dec ) and , in model - fitting , we tried to use a number of components that did not produce an oversimplified representation of the data . in particular , to avoid resolution or frequency effects ,",
    "we used only 15ghz data , plus the 8.4ghz observation at epoch 1998.48 .",
    "the results obtained from model - fitting of visibilities in difmap are presented in table  4 and fig .",
    "[ positions ] .",
    "these results are in agreement with those obtained by fitting gaussian components to the images ( using ` jmfit ` in aips ) .",
    "the data are in general well fitted by a core and four jet components , in agreement with @xcite ( not surprisingly , as most data are the same ) .",
    "we labelled components according to the same notation for ease of comparison : c1 to c4 moving from the outermost component inward .",
    "however , for the reasons stated above , we adopted two gaussians for each of the components c2 and c1 at many epochs .",
    "this produced a better fit to the data , in agreement with the resolved limb - brightened jet structure present in these regions .",
    "nominal position errors are very small .",
    "the major uncertainty is related to the complex source structure .",
    "we estimate a position error of @xmath260.1mas for c4 , c3 , c2 and @xmath110.2mas for c1 .    from our analysis we conclude that no proper motion is visible in any of the four components .",
    "consider the case of component c2 : @xcite measured a proper motion of @xmath27 for this component .",
    "however , we note that at the position of c2 two faint external peaks are visible in the 22ghz image ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) on either side of the lower frequency component .",
    "they could even have a different spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ spix1 ] ) .",
    "the peak position visible at lower resolution in the 15ghz image is therefore the blend of the limb - brightened structure visible at 22ghz . in the space vlbi image at 5ghz , the component c2 is at a different position with respect to the 15ghz images : this could be due to different spectra for the different components .",
    "we conclude that it is not possible to measure a proper motion for such a complex structure and that any pattern velocity measurement from low resolution data is not related to the jet bulk speed in this source .      under the assumption of intrinsically symmetric two - sided jets affected by doppler boosting effects ,",
    "the observational data allow one to estimate the jet bulk velocity . in the following",
    ", we present the results derived from a study of the jet / counterjet ratio , core dominance and jet expansion .      from the lack of detection of a counter - jet in all the images (  [ sec : morphology ] ) , we set a lower limit on the jet / counterjet ratio .",
    "we use the highest ratio between the jet brightness and the counterjet upper limit .",
    "we estimate this ratio excluding the innermost region of the jet ; this avoids contamination from the unresolved central emission . the best image for this analysis is the space vlbi observation obtained in apr 1998 at 1.6ghz . from this image",
    "we can derive a jet / counterjet ratio @xmath28 ( 1  rms ) at @xmath114mas from the core . given the well known relation @xmath29 , and assuming",
    "@xmath30 ( see  [ sec : index ] ) , this value yields @xmath31 . in turn , this implies @xmath320.89 and @xmath3327@xmath15 .",
    "our deep , low resolution images allow us to also put a constraint at large distance from the core . in particular , in the 1.6ghz image from the 2001.3 data , at @xmath34 mas from the core",
    "we still have r @xmath35 70 ; although less extreme , this value is also very interesting , as it implies that the jet remains at least mildly relativistic ( @xmath36 ) even at large distances from the core .",
    "it is not possible to extend this analysis further with our data .",
    "however , we remind the reader of the symmetric morphology of the source on the kpc scale (  [ sec : morphology ] ) .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the jet slows to subrelativistic speed going from the parsec to the kpc scales .",
    "given the general relation between total and core radio power @xcite , we can use low frequency unboosted data to compute an `` expected '' value for the core power . a comparison between the expected and measured 5ghz core radio power allows to constrain the jet orientation and velocity @xcite .",
    "we note that at 5ghz self - absorption effects are small ( see  [ sec : parameters ] ) ; however , to take also into account possible core variability , we allow the observed core flux density to vary by a factor of 2 .",
    "this is a conservative assumption , based on the total flux density monitoring and the range of derived vlbi core flux densities ( see  [ sec : variability ] ) , and , more generally , on statistical flux density variability of agn in the radio .",
    "to estimate the orientation and jet velocity for mkn 501 , we have compared its total unboosted flux density ( 1.81jy ) at 408mhz @xcite , with the nuclear flux density at 5ghz . since @xcite used the arcsecond core radio power to derive their correlation , we adopted the total vlbi correlated flux density at 5ghz ( @xmath11800mjy ) as the mkn 501 core flux density .",
    "any possible underestimate in this assumption is compensated for by the allowed range ( a factor of 2 ) in flux density variability .",
    "we found that mkn 501 has to be oriented at @xmath37 27@xmath15 with @xmath380.88 .",
    "we note that a high jet velocity ( @xmath390.95 ) is allowed only in the range 10@xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath40 @xmath16 27@xmath15 .",
    "high velocities are forbidden at smaller angles ; the resulting doppler factor would require a core much brighter than observed .",
    "the functional dependence of the jet intensity on the jet velocity and radius for an adiabatically expanding jet has been discussed in the case of relativistic motion by @xcite .",
    "since the model represents a simplification of the real situation , the results should be considered with caution and compared with other observational results .",
    "this model has enabled useful constraints to be placed , in agreement with other data , for 3c264 @xcite and other sources , such as ngc315 @xcite and 3c449 @xcite .    to apply this model we used our deep vsop observations at 1.6ghz obtained in march 2001 and in april 1998 . in these observations , the jet emission is visible on scales up to @xmath41mas ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "first , we derived brightness profiles across the jet ; we used the aips task ` slice ` on an image reconstructed with a circular beam of 7mas diameter , where the longest baselines have been omitted to increase the signal to noise ratio . in the innermost region ( @xmath42mas from the core )",
    ", we have 8 slices , taken every half beam - width at pa 27.2@xmath43 .",
    "after the main bend , we considered 12 more slices , each one beam apart , at pa @xmath44 .",
    "we stopped our analysis @xmath45mas from the core ; further out , the low jet brightness and the presence of extended sub - structures do not allow the data to be fitted well .    using the aips task slfit , we fitted single gaussians to each profile .",
    "this could be done unambiguously in most cases , although in a few slices some deviation from a pure single gaussian profile was present .",
    "however , the difference between the area subtended by the profile and the fit is always smaller than 5% and does not affect the analysis .",
    "we plot the resulting fwhms and peak brightnesses in fig .",
    "[ trends1 ] and [ trends2 ] ; the quantities have been deconvolved from the clean beam , according to the formula given by @xcite .",
    "there are clearly two regimes ; least - squares fits yield a power - law of index @xmath46 in the inner jet ( @xmath47mas from the core ) and @xmath48 in the outer regions . in the following",
    ", we use these best - fit solutions rather then the actual data ; this prevents us from spurious results brought about by random fluctuations .",
    "we recall the equations given in @xcite for the jet surface brightness @xmath49 :    @xmath50 ( predominantly parallel magnetic field )    @xmath51 ( predominantly transverse magnetic field ) .",
    "we assume an injection spectral index @xmath52 , as suggested from the average @xmath53 in the image , excluding the self - absorbed core (  [ sec : index ] ) .",
    "it is not easy to decide which magnetic field regime is preferable : according to the 8.4ghz images of @xcite , the mkn 501 jet is highly polarized at the edges with the magnetic field parallel to the jet flow , while in the jet spine the magnetic field is orthogonal to the jet flow with a lower degree of order .",
    "@xcite report a 5ghz electric vector pa distribution consistent with this result but the lower resolution renders the results less conclusive .",
    "therefore , since the percentage of ordered field and the intrinsic orientation are not well known , we consider the two cases of pure parallel and perpendicular magnetic field orientation ; in a disordered magnetic field , the real result will be in between the two extreme situations .",
    "figure  [ adiabatic ] shows the derived trends of @xmath54 for an initial lorentz factor @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) with parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields . in each plot",
    ", we draw five lines , corresponding to angles to the line of sight of 5@xmath43 , 10@xmath43 , ... , 25@xmath43 ( i.e. , in the range of values allowed by the jet sidedness and core dominance ) .",
    "we note that the jet velocity decreases with the core distance , more slowly in the perpendicular case , and on a shorter scale in the parallel case .",
    "the lack of detection of the cj in all our images strongly constrains any possible model since it implies a relativistic jet also at large distance from the core ( @xmath58pc ) .",
    "models with low initial lorentz factor ( @xmath59 ) are definitely ruled out , regardless of the assumed magnetic field orientation , since they disagree with both the observed limb - brightened structure (  [ sec : jvs ] ) and the jet / counterjet ratio ( at least in the case of the parallel magnetic field ) ; moreover , they require a jet deceleration (  [ sec : jvs ] ) between the @xmath5ray region and radio jet region that is too strong . among models with a higher initial speed ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "the case of the parallel magnetic field requires an orientation angle of 25@xmath15 , at least at @xmath3570mas from the core , to be in agreement with the observed jet / counterjet brightness ratio .",
    "we can not exclude models with a narrow angle to the line of sight at small distances from the core , where solutions are similar .",
    "in the case of the perpendicular magnetic field , the constraints are less severe since we have a fast jet even at large distances from the core .      in fig .",

    "[ spix3 ] ) shows that the inner regions c4 , c3 , c2 have @xmath71 in the range @xmath72 , while regions in between are much steeper ( @xmath73 and higher ) .",
    "the large component c1 is too faint and resolved to be properly imaged at these high frequencies .",
    "a marginal suggestion is present of a spectral steepening moving from the inner ( spine ) to the external jet region but at this high angular resolution the jet width is not well defined .",
    "it is interesting to consider the nuclear flux density over the whole range of frequency .",
    "we are aware that the compact core of mkn 501 presents some variability ( see  [ sec : variability ] ) ; however , the large number of observations and frequencies available allow us to carry out such a study based on average values .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] the average core peak flux density , from the images at resolution of 0.6@xmath90.9mas ( see table  3 ) ; at 1.6ghz , we had to consider super - resolved images , in order to avoid a large contamination from the jet .",
    "the spectrum is convex , peaking at @xmath74ghz and steepening toward the high frequency end .",
    "below the turnover frequency , the spectrum is flatter than @xmath75 , as would be expected for a single self - absorbed component .",
    "this suggests that different components with different turnover frequencies may be blended together .",
    "limb brightened jet morphology on parsec scales is present in some fr  i sources but also in a few high power fr  ii sources @xcite . a possible explanation is the presence of velocity structure in the jet .",
    "when viewed at a relatively large angle to the line of sight , this structure yields different doppler factors for the internal spine and the external shear layer .",
    "in particular , an inner high velocity spine could be de - boosted while a slower external layer could be less strongly de - boosted , or even boosted .",
    "transverse jet velocity structure has been found by @xcite in 3c31 , where the jet velocity in outer regions is @xmath110.7 the inner spine velocity .",
    "@xcite invoke such a structure to account for observational discrepancies between fr  i and bl - lac objects .",
    "a possible origin of the velocity structure is the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium and its consequent entrainment ; the mass loading slows down the jet in the external regions , while the inner spine travels unaffected .",
    "however , the presence of limb brightened jets in both high and low power sources @xcite and the evidence in m87 that the jet structure is present very near to the core emission ( see the image presented by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggest the possibility that the velocity structure may originate at the base of the jet .",
    "@xcite presents a model where the inner high velocity spine is produced in the black hole region , while the external shear moving at lower velocity is produced in a more extended region downstream .    in mkn 501",
    ", it is interesting to note that the jet structure is visible at a distance @xmath161mas from the core , suggesting that it originates very close to the base of the jet .",
    "however , we recall that , at @xmath1 , 1mas corresponds to @xmath76pc , i.e. , @xmath77 schwarzschild radii ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein for a discussion on the central black hole mass in mkn 501 ) and , therefore , we do not have the angular resolution to see this jet inner region .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the presence of velocity structure so near to the nuclear source implies too strong a deceleration if it is completely due to the jet interaction with the ism .",
    "we suggest ( in agreement with m87 data of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that a transverse velocity gradient is intrinsic to the jet structure ( as discussed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that a further velocity decrease due to mass loading in the jet from the ism is likely to be present and possibly dominates the jet velocity structure at larger distances from the core .",
    "we have strong indications that in mkn 501 the radio jet emission is oriented at a large angle with respect to the line of sight relative to that expected for a blazar :    * from the jet morphology : the jet is limb - brightened in high resolution images at @xmath78mas from the core .",
    "the different brightness can be related to a different doppler factor only with an orientation angle @xmath40 15@xmath15 .",
    "then , we can reproduce the observed ratio between the brightness of the external shear and the inner spine with @xmath79 , assuming @xmath80 ( see tables  6 , 7 ) . with these values , the spine doppler factor ( @xmath81 ) is lower than the external layer doppler factor ( @xmath82 ) . on the contrary , a jet orientation at a smaller angle and/or a lower spine velocity imply @xmath83 and therefore a centrally peaked structure .",
    "* from the core dominance : the core boosting is high but not extreme ; high bulk velocities require , therefore , an orientation angle @xmath40 in the range 10@xmath1527@xmath15 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "* from the fit to the trend of the jet brightness and fwhm : assuming an adiabatic model and consistency with the jet / counterjet brightness ratio , we need a radio jet starting with a high velocity ( @xmath840.998 ) , and in the case of a parallel magnetic field , @xmath40 has to be @xmath1125@xmath15 at @xmath3570mas .    these results seem to be in disagreement with constraints derived from the high frequency ( @xmath0-ray ) emission and variability detected in blazars . studying the rapid burst of tev photons in mkn 421 , @xcite determine that a jet with a bulk velocity @xmath8510 with opening angle and orientation angle @xmath86 is required .",
    "similarly , in mkn  501 the expected doppler factor should be 10 , as obtained from fits of synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models @xcite . to reconcile the radio and high frequency results we have to assume that the inner region of the jet ( 0.0010.03pc ) is moving with a lorentz factor 10 and oriented at @xmath87 . from this region",
    "we have high energy radiation and negligible radio emission . over the range from 0.03 to 50pc",
    "( projected distance ) the jet orientation has to change from @xmath115@xmath15 to 25@xmath15 ( or at least @xmath88 in the case of perpendicular magnetic field ) .",
    "we propose that this large change in the jet direction may be gradual and we derive the minimum change requested by observational data at different distances from the core . as shown in table  6 , a progressive change in the jet direction with respect to the line of sight is possible and in agreement with the observed pc - scale jet properties .    at present , there is no obvious explanation for this change in the jet direction in the inner region .",
    "it is possible that it could be related to helical type motion @xcite ( although helical motion is not visible in our high resolution images ) , or to an instability in the jet due to reasons that are thus far unknown .",
    "it is also important to stress that small changes in direction are not uncommon in fr  i radio galaxies and are magnified when projection effects occur . in any case",
    ", we recall that beyond 30mas from the core the jet position angle becomes stable and closely aligned with the kpc - scale structure .",
    "we note that in the case of the perpendicular magnetic field the jet velocity is still very high at large distances from the core , in agreement with the lack of detection of a visible counterjet in all published maps of this source and despite the symmetric structure visible in the vla low resolution image @xcite .",
    "however , we recall that @xmath89 is required to justify the observed limb - brightened structure from doppler boosting alone , even in the case of perpendicular magnetic field .      from the present data",
    "we can derive that :    * the nuclear region shows a self - absorbed spectrum with a peak frequency @xmath90ghz and a peak flux density @xmath91jy .",
    "following @xcite , we can use these data to estimate the magnetic field in the nuclear region ( from 0.03 to 0.15pc ) : + b = @xmath92 + assuming @xmath40 ( the core angular size ) = 0.2mas ( 0.15pc ) and @xmath93=5 ( table  6 ) , we estimate a magnetic field b@xmath110.03  gauss . on the other hand ,",
    "fits of ssc models to a high energy state observed in april 1997 yield values of the magnetic field in the range 0.20.02  gauss in the inner region ( @xmath160.03pc ) @xcite .",
    "this suggests a constant or a not very large decrease of the magnetic field from the gamma ray emitting region to the beginning of the radio jet . *",
    "the radio spectra of jet sub - components show an evident steepening at high frequencies , suggesting the effect of radiative losses in a high magnetic field . * in the region where the jet is well resolved",
    ", the spectrum is flat in the inner spine confirming the presence of a higher transport efficiency , lower radiative losses , or reacceleration mechanisms .",
    "the transverse steepening from the spine to the shear layer regions confirms the larger losses in these regions , probably related to the interaction with the external medium . *",
    "it is not straightforward to determine the equipartition magnetic field @xcite given the complex structure of the jet .",
    "we can obtain a rough estimate by assuming that electrons and heavy particles carry the same amount of energy ( @xmath94 ) , the filling factor @xmath95=1 , and the frequency range is between 10mhz and 100ghz .",
    "this yields @xmath110.015  gauss in the c4 and c3 regions and 0.01  gauss in the c2 and c1 regions . * assuming a viewing angle @xmath40 as in tables  6 and 7 , the observed angular distances correspond to the following de - projected linear distances : +  the inner limb - brightened region is present at @xmath164pc from the core +  the first jet region extends to @xmath1110mas , corresponding to @xmath1130pc +  the vlbi jet is visible up to 170270pc ( assuming @xmath40 = 25@xmath15  15@xmath15 , respectively ) +  the kpc - scale structure is symmetric ( i.e. not relativistic ) at @xmath96kpc from the core +  the large scale symmetric structure extending to @xmath1170@xmath97 corresponds to a linear size of 120200kpc , in agreement with the expected linear size of a fr i radio galaxy with the same low frequency total radio power .",
    "as a result of the many frequencies and resolutions available , we have established that a limb - brightened structure is indeed present in markarian 501 , beginning in the very inner jet .",
    "this has important consequences : ( 1 ) it implies the presence of velocity structure already at very small scale , which jet models will have to take into account ; ( 2 ) it suggests , together with other arguments , that the vlbi jet can not be oriented at too small a viewing angle .",
    "in particular , the detection of a very long one - sided jet and the results of an adiabatic expansion fit yield values of the angle of view in the range @xmath98 , depending also on the magnetic field orientation .",
    "the bulk velocity is strongly relativistic at the beginning ( @xmath99 ) , decreasing to @xmath100 ( @xmath1011.25 ) at the end of the vlbi jet , 100mas from the core ( parallel @xmath102 ) or to @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) in the case of a perpendicular @xmath102 .",
    "the data considered here are consistent with a pattern speed of zero . previous reports , based mostly on lower frequency observations , have reported low pattern speeds , however the complex limb - brightened structure revealed at 22ghz makes measurement of component speeds problematic at high frequencies .",
    "finally , the study of the spectral indices has revealed a self - absorbed compact core and a complex spectral index distribution in the jet with flat and very steep regions . a clear connection is present between limb - brightening in total intensity and the spectral index images : the inner spine has a flat spectrum while the jet more external regions show steep spectra .",
    "our derived magnetic field strengths are similar to those obtained from data at other wavelengths , yielding values of order @xmath105  gauss in the core region .",
    "the estimated equipartition field in the jet region is in the range 0.0150.01  gauss .",
