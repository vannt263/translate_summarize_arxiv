    "neutral hydrogen gas ( ) on the edges of spiral galaxies is only very loosely gravitationally bound .",
    "therefore , when spiral galaxies interact , the outer can be easily disturbed ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) . during a merger , the may be heated and ionised , or may cool into molecular ( @xmath4 ) clouds within the remnant ( hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "it may be tidally driven into the centre of the galaxy and converted into molecular gas , or it could be turned into stars when tidal streams collide and become compressed . the gas may also escape the interacting system and disperse , becoming too diffuse to detect , or perhaps ionised .",
    "this paper re - examines the evidence for deficiency in compact groups of galaxies using a new survey , the parkes all sky survey .",
    "compact groups of galaxies are excellent places to look for interactions and mergers between ( spiral ) galaxies .",
    "a compact group is defined as having several galaxies with similar redshifts within a small area of the sky , which are also isolated from surrounding galaxies .",
    "this ensures that the cores of clusters are excluded from the definition .",
    "a compact group generally has a low velocity dispersion , @xmath5250 km s@xmath6 ( hickson 1997 ) , and a crossing time much smaller than the hubble time , meaning interactions and mergers are very likely",
    ". although the fraction of spirals in the field is higher ( @xmath580% ) , the fraction of compact group galaxies which are spirals is still @xmath550% ( hickson 1997 ) .",
    "although interactions are thought to be common in compact groups , the star - formation rate ( sfr ) , and the amount of molecular gas in the galaxies in the compact groups , are only weakly enhanced in comparison to field galaxies ( leon et al .",
    "they concluded that only compact groups with a very small mean separation of @xmath730 kpc had a strong @xmath4 enhancement .",
    "verdes - montenegro et al . ( 1998 ) also showed that while 20% of compact groups had an apparent deficiency of co emission , the rest had co and fir properties similar to isolated galaxies .",
    "both leon et al . ( 1998 ) and verdes - montenegro et al . (",
    "1998 ) concluded that tidal interactions in compact groups were very important in the groups evolution .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the extent to which the in compact groups has been affected by the environment .",
    "this has been investigated previously by williams & rood ( 1987 , hereafter wr87 ) , huchtmeier ( 1997 , hereafter h97 ) and verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , all of whom observed subsamples of the hickson compact groups ( hcgs , hickson 1982 ) .",
    "their results indicated that the average amount of in the groups was between 40% and 50% of the mass expected by summing the mean mass in comparable field galaxies .",
    "williams & rood ( 1987 ) compared the content of the compact groups with that of a reference sample of loose groups ( rlg ) , and with a sample of 204 spiral galaxies in the rc2 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1976 ) . in the south , wr87 observed hcgs 3 , 14 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 26 , 30 , 31 , 40 , 62 , 64 , 67 , 88 , 89 and 97 . the comparison loose groups were selected to have the same number of galaxies as the compact groups , and to have the same joint distribution of galaxy luminosity , hubble morphological type .",
    "the expected masses therefore were a function of the luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "twenty - seven of the 34 detected compact groups had less than the comparable loose group .",
    "a similar procedure was used by huchtmeier ( 1997 ) , using an explicit relation between the integrated blue luminosities of the groups and the expected masses of the groups .",
    "the groups observed in the south were hcgs 4 , 14 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 30 , 40 , 42 , 48 , 62 , 67 , 87 , 91 and 97 . in comparison to four nearby groups",
    ", a reference sample of 146 galaxies ( huchtmeier & richter 1988 ) , and to the virgo cluster spirals , several compact groups appeared to have a very low mass - to - blue luminosity ratio .",
    "these authors did not consider how the mass of the compact groups related to the distribution of masses in the comparison samples .",
    "instead , only the average values of the sample galaxy masses were used . however , any two galaxies with identical optical measurements ( eg . diameter , morphology , luminosity ) will not necessarily have the same mass .",
    "there may be a dependence of the mass on these observables , but the scatter in this correlation is significant .",
    "verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) compiled the data from wr87 and h97 , and added vla imaging of 16 hcgs ( 2 , 16 , 18 , 23 , 26 , 31 , 33 , 40 , 44 , 49 , 54 , 79 , 88 , 92 , 95 , 96 ) . using all 72 groups from the combined sample , verdes - montenegro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) calculated the mean `` deficiency '' to be def@xmath8 , where def@xmath9 - \\log[{\\rm m(hi)}_{\\rm observed}]$ ] .",
    "a comparison sample from haynes & giovanelli ( 1984 ) was used .",
    "this comparison sample is also used in this paper and is described in section  [ estimators ] .",
    "calculated values of def@xmath10 suggested that compact groups contained only 40% of the mass of comparable field galaxies .",
    "verdes - montenegro et al . ( 2001 ) also deduced that an evolutionary sequence for hcgs could be followed , beginning with being associated with individual galaxies , through to the gas enveloping the entire group , to a group having no detectable .",
    "this paper compares the content of the galaxies in compact groups with estimated values of mass for field galaxies .",
    "the distribution of mass in the reference field galaxies will be specifically included in the comparison .",
    "thus it is possible to identify groups with masses outside the expected range .",
    "the upper limits of the non - detected groups are also taken into account using the statistical methods of buckley & james ( 1979 ) .",
    "this paper first deals with the selection of the group sample ( section  [ samplesel ] ) , and then with the observations , reduction and the derived parameters ( section  [ obsresults ] ) .",
    "the mass estimation methods are described in section  [ estimators ] , as well as the estimated content of the groups .",

    "compact groups were selected from the optical catalogues of hickson ( 1982 , hereafter h82 ) and prandoni et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereafter p94 ) .",
    "the sample included all compact groups which had a declination @xmath12 , and a velocity @xmath13 km s@xmath6 .",
    "a total of 62 groups satisfied these criteria , and are the primary sample of this paper .",
    "hipass covers the entire southern sky up to a declination of @xmath14 , over the velocity range @xmath15 km s@xmath6 ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 ) . using the 13-beam multibeam instrument on the parkes radio telescope ,",
    "the survey was completed in march 2000 .",
    "the velocity resolution of the survey is 18.0 km s@xmath6 , and the rms noise per channel is typically 13 mjy .",
    "the hickson compact groups ( h82 ) - for which a complete catalogue of properties of the constituent galaxies is available ( hickson 1993 ) - were selected so that a direct comparison with previous results could be made .",
    "the southern compact groups ( scgs , p94 ) were selected by an automatic routine , and therefore have the potential to be a more complete and less biased sample ( p94 ) .",
    "however , there has not been a published follow - up survey of the member galaxies , and thus the scgs do not have complete redshift information .",
    "h82 selected groups from the red palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) plates by eye , with each of the groups satisfying specific criteria .",
    "firstly , the groups needed to be compact and isolated .",
    "specifically , there needed to be at least 4 galaxies within 3 magnitudes of the brightest galaxy , all within a circle of angular radius @xmath16 , the group radius .",
    "the isolation criteria specified that there should be no galaxies within 3 magnitudes of the brightest galaxy within @xmath17 of the group centre .",
    "the magnitude concordance was used to select physically associated groups without any redshift information , while the isolation criteria ensured that the cores of clusters , and associations in clusters were not identified as compact groups .",
    "p94 selected groups in the same way as h82 , except that the search was on cosmos scans of plates taken with the united kingdom schmidt telescope ( ukst ) , and the search algorithm was machine implemented .",
    "the miriad task * mbspect * was used to inspect the hipass spectrum for each group , which was made by averaging over a region of 5@xmath185 pixels , centered on the optically determined position of the group .",
    "each hipass pixel is 4 arcminutes on a side .",
    "this 20@xmath1920@xmath20 averaging area ensures that all flux coming from the groups is accounted for , as the largest group in the sample has an optical diameter of @xmath21 .",
    "the spectra were examined by eye for emission lines , and groups with evidence of emission were selected for reobservation .",
    "the hcg spectra were searched at each group s known optical velocity ( hickson 1993 ) .",
    "the scgs however , do not have comprehensive velocity information for all their member galaxies , and thus the entire velocity range of hipass was examined at each scg position on the sky .    in total",
    ", 19 hcgs and 21 scgs showed possible emission .",
    "twelve hcgs and ten scgs were clear non - detections .",
    "the primary sample for this paper is shown in table  [ basicdata ] .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the name of the compact group , and columns ( 2 ) & ( 3 ) give the position of the group in j2000 coordinates .",
    ".basic observational data for the compact group sample and pointed observations using the mx mode .",
    "descriptions of the quantities in each column are given in the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , this result can be contrasted to that found by solanes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who studied the deficiency in spiral galaxies found in clusters .",
    "they found that within 1 abell radius ( 1 r@xmath22 ) of the cluster centre , spiral galaxies show strong deficiency , while in the outer parts of the cluster , the contents were similar to those found in the field .",
    "as the galactic densities of compact groups can approach that of the cores of rich clusters ( h82 ) , it is interesting then that compact groups do not show the same deficiency .",
    "solanes et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that hydrodynamical effects caused by the interaction of the with the hot intracluster medium in the centre of the clusters was the cause of the deficiency .",
    "they also found stripping was a relatively recent event ( a few gyr ago ) for the deficient galaxies , as the optical properties of the galaxies have not been affected .",
    "one possibility then for the normal content of the compact group sample investigated in this paper is the lack of a hot intragroup medium to strip the .",
    "this agrees with x - ray observations of the hcgs from ponman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , who concluded that only 20% of groups had diffuse x - ray emission with luminosity greater than 10@xmath23 ergs .",
    "this luminosity is an order of magnitude weaker than the weakest cluster emission reported by solanes et al .",
    "* this study has shown that southern compact groups in the hcg catalogue appear have a content consistent with the hypothesis that they are comprised of galaxies similar to those found in the field . * in comparing the mass estimation methods of hg84 and h97 , it was found that they all give similar results , although the scatter in the relationships prevents them from predicting the mass of an isolated galaxy accurately . * the observations of the detected compact groups all have measured contents within the predicted range for",
    "their expected content .",
    "however , the majority of groups were not detected in this study , and so the content of the compact group population as a whole is not yet known . *",
    "the survey has not been significantly affected by biasing due to interlopers lying far outside the group radius ; nor from faint galaxies not listed as part of the compact groups , but contributing to the mass . *",
    "the in the compact groups may have evolved through interactions , and star - formation , but it is clear that the fraction of consumed is not large .",
    "it is possible that depletion is correlated with morphological evolution towards earlier types , which would reduce the expected mass of the group . * a survey of these groups with much higher sensitivity , leading to more detections or more stringent upper limits",
    ", will give a clearer picture on their content .",
