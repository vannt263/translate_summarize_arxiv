    "in this article we extend previous work which combined the two fields of quantum information and ultra - cold bosons to propose a method for the fabrication of spatially isolated entangled atomic populations  @xcite .",
    "we do this by comparing the performance of a three - well bose - hubbard system  @xcite to that of an optical beamsplitter for the production of spatially separated output modes , using well - known criteria  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider the quadrature based criteria  @xcite which were not considered in the earlier paper .",
    "the field of ultra - cold bosons has seen much experimental and theoretical investigation since the successful bose condensation of bosonic atoms . for atoms trapped in an optical lattice",
    ", one investigative technique uses the bose - hubbard model .",
    "this model , from condensed matter physics , was originally shown by jaksch  @xcite to provide an accurate description of bosonic atoms trapped in a deep optical lattice . in this work",
    "we use a three well bose - hubbard model to propose and analyse the entangling properties of a quantum atom optical mode splitter and recombiner .",
    "we show that this can split an initial condensate in the central well into two separated entangled condensates , with the detection of the entanglement being sensitive to both the initial quantum state of the condensate in the central well , and to the actual criteria used .",
    "we then examine and compare a quantum optical beamsplitter with one vacuum input with regard to the same correlations and input quantum states .",
    "the area of continuous - variable entanglement is very active  @xcite , with many criteria having been developed to signify the presence of inseparability and entanglement , especially in bipartite systems .",
    "many of these only apply fully to gaussian systems and gaussian measurements .",
    "the most commonly used measurements are those developed by duan @xcite and simon  @xcite , using combinations of quadrature variances .",
    "more recently , teh and reid have shown the degree of violation of these inequalities that is necessary to demonstrate not just inseparability , but genuine entanglement  @xcite , as these are only necessarily the same property for pure states .",
    "the criteria we use in this work fall into two categories .",
    "those in the first category were developed by hillery and zubairy  @xcite and expanded on by cavalcanti @xcite to cover multipartite entanglement , steering , and violations of bell inequalities .",
    "as shown by he @xcite , the hillery and zubairy criteria are well suited to number conserving processes such as those of interest here .",
    "the second category are quadrature based criteria , originally developed by duan  @xcite and simon  @xcite for inseparability and entanglement , and by reid  @xcite for demonstrations of the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox  @xcite .",
    "multi - mode entanglement in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) has been predicted and examined in the processes of molecular dissociation  @xcite , four - wave mixing in an optical lattice  @xcite , and in the bose - hubbard model  @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the separation of the modes is produced by the tunneling between wells , in both the continuous  @xcite and pulsed tunneling configurations  @xcite .",
    "the quantum correlations necessary to detect entanglement can in principle be measured using the interaction with light  @xcite , or by homodyning with other atomic modes  @xcite .",
    "we note here that the entanglement we are examining is a collective property between atomic modes which are spatially separated , and is not between individual atoms  @xcite .",
    "this point , which is unavoidable for indistinguishable bosons , has previously been raised by chianca and olsen  @xcite , and was recently put on a formal basis , using the language of quantum information theory , by killoran @xcite .",
    "we will follow the approach taken by milburn @xcite , generalising this to three wells  @xcite , and solving either the heisenberg equations of motion or the fully quantum positive - p phase space representation  @xcite equations , depending on whether there is a collisional interaction present or not .",
    "we consider these to be the most suitable approaches here because they are both exact , allow for an easy representation of mesoscopic numbers of atoms , can be used to calculate quantum correlations , and can simulate different quantum initial states  @xcite .",
    "just as importantly , both calculations scale linearly with the number of sites and can in principle deal with any number of atoms . one disadvantage of the positive - p representation is that the integration can show a tendency to diverge at short times for high collisional nonlinearities  @xcite .",
    "as long as the procedures followed to derive the fokker - planck equation for the positive - p function are valid  @xcite , the stochastic solutions are guaranteed to be accurate wherever the integration converges . with all the results shown here , the solutions were found without any signs of divergences .",
    "the system is very simple , with three potential wells in a linear configuration .",
    "each of these can contain a single atomic mode , which we will treat as being in the lowest energy level .",
    "atoms in each of the wells can tunnel into the nearest neighbour potential , with tunneling between wells @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "with all the population initially in the middle well , the system acts as a time dependent mode splitter and recombiner . with the @xmath4 as bosonic annihilation operators for atoms in mode @xmath5 , @xmath6 representing the coupling between the wells , and @xmath7 as the collisional nonlinearity",
    ", we may now write our hamiltonian .",
    "following the usual procedures  @xcite , we find @xmath8      for the case where the collisional interaction between the atoms is set to zero , we find that an analytical solution of the heisenberg equations of motion for the system operators is possible .",

    "we can also solve the heisenberg equations in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the quadrature operators .",
    "setting @xmath14 we find @xmath15 which then allow us to find solutions for any correlations written in terms of these quadratures .",
    "examples of these are the quadrature squeezing  @xcite and reid epr correlations  @xcite .      in this case",
    "( @xmath16 ) , it is not obvious how to solve the equations of motion analytically .",

    "the epr - steering inequality for two modes is written as @xmath36 while the bell state inequality is written as @xmath37 calling on the overworked alice and bob , if alice measures mode @xmath31 and bob measures mode @xmath5 a violation of the inequality ( [ eq : ericepr ] ) signifies that bob would be able to steer alice , and vice versa for a swapping of the modes .",
    "these inequalities allow us to define a correlation function which signifies the presence of epr - steering when it has a value of greater than zero , @xmath38 and another for which a positive value signifies the presence of bell correlations , @xmath39    for the epr - steering correlation , we can solve the heisenberg equations to find @xmath40 which is readily seen to have a maximum value of zero . therefore this measure does not detect any possibility of epr - steering for this system",
    ". there will also obviously be no signature of a continuous variable bell state of the two modes .",

    "those based on the hillery - zubairy results perform better for an initial fock state than for an initial coherent state in the middle well , for which the quadrature based correlations have a superior performance .",

    "the quadrature correlations predict neither entanglement nor epr - steering for an initial fock state , but predict both for squeezed states .",
    "the biggest difference is that the beamsplitter outputs do not depend on time , at least for continuous inputs , while the atomic system experiences either periodic or almost periodic behaviour , depending on the presence or otherwise of atomic collisions . as long as the interactions are not too strong ,",
