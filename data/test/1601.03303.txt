    "gauge theories based on the principle of local gauge invariance provide foundations of our current understanding of fundamental forces of nature .",
    "the simplest of them , quantum electrodynamics , describes the dynamics of gauge bosons ( photons ) and their coupling to matter ( electrons ) .",
    "one of the central ideas in modern physics concerns thus the concept of a local gauge invariance . with the advent of quantum spin liquids @xcite",
    ", it has been proposed that gauge bosons can be emergent .",
    "quantum spin liquids represent states of matter that do not break any global symmetry .",
    "it was suggested that the low energy spectrum of spin liquids , or more generally certain low - dimensional quantum spin systems ( and related strongly correlated fermionic systems ) can be described by emergent gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "these gauge bosons emerge naturally in a mean field description of the models .",
    "unfortunately , it has also been found that most of the times fluctuations destroy such a nice description by strongly binding the gauge bosons @xcite and producing a low energy sector dominated by standard spin fluctuations .",
    "for this reason the validity of such an emergent gauge theory descriptions still remains a subject of a considerable debate @xcite .    in particular , in spacial 2d ( 2 + 1 dimensions , if time is considered ) , low energy sector of abelian gauge theories with @xmath0 gauge symmetry exhibits gapped confined phase , as pointed out first by polyakov @xcite .",
    "for discrete gauge symmetry ( @xmath1 ) both confined and deconfined phases exist @xcite ; both are gapped , however , and the extent of the latter in the parameter space vanishes as @xmath2 tends to infinity .    rather than asking",
    "if the low energy description of a given model hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of a gauge theory , one could take the complementary approach of characterizing all possible phases described by gauge theories to see if some of them resemble those that we observe in strongly correlated spin / fermionic systems .",
    "unfortunately , typically these systems are notoriously difficult to characterize analytically and numerically .",
    "that has led many authors to propose novel quantum simulators schemes that would allow to characterize the phases of gauge hamiltonians @xcite with ultra - cold atoms@xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we follow a complementary approach , we consider the low energy physics of a class of bosonic hamiltonians and show how they can be described by a set of emerging gauge theories , we also propose and design experimentally feasible ways to quantum simulate them .",
    "our hamiltonian describe two - species bosons hopping on a two dimensional square lattice . depending on the tunneling geometry of one of the bosonic species ( referred to as auxiliary particles ) , one obtains different low energy emerging gauge theories for the other particles .",
    "our main results are that the low - energy sector of the remaining bosons can always be characterized by an emergent gauge theory .",
    "more specifically it can be described in terms of collective plaquette degrees of freedom @xcite of the original bosons .",
    "these collective plaquette variables can be thought as arising from gauge bosons living on a coarse - grained version of the original lattice .",
    "the emerging gauge theories are abelian , but can have a discrete @xmath1 or continuous @xmath0 invariance .",
    "they are exotic , in the sense that they differ from the standard hamiltonian models @xcite that only exhibit gapped ( confined or not ) phases . for our models ,",
    "however , we encounter an additional set of symmetries , conserving charges along columns of the lattice . as a consequence of such symmetries , and of the related breaking of rotation invariance",
    ", we find that the ground state contains exotic gapped deconfined phases with dipolar and kink excitations to gapless bose - liquids .",
    "importantly , our models can be realized with currently existing experimental techniques with ultracold atoms , as we discuss in the methods section .",

    "we also identify the nearest neighbor of site @xmath5 in the direction @xmath6 as site @xmath8 . on each site of the lattice we have two species of bosons : _ auxiliary _ _ a_-bosons and _ b_-bosons . the creation and annihilation operators for the two species are respectively @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",

    "_ stands for hermitian conjugate .",
    "this is a generalization of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian , in which the tunneling amplitudes of _ a_-bosons are link dependent , @xmath16 , while those for _ b_-bosons @xmath17 are uniform .",
    "more importantly phases of the tunneling amplitudes of _",
    "a_-bosons are modulated by the occupation of _",
    "b_-bosons on neighboring sites as illustrated in the right - hand panel of fig.[figure1]a .",

    "the lattice configurations for both bosons are shown in fig.[figure1]a .",
    "b_-bosons are assumed to be non - interacting .        in the present article",
    "we show that the low energy sector of hamiltonian , is described by an exotic gauge theory for _ b_-bosons filling @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , the above hamiltonian can be engineered experimentally in an ultra - cold atoms set up . in that context",
    "a_-bosons tunneling inhomogeneity can be realized by trapping them in optical super - lattices .",
    "the large filling of _",
    "b_-bosons is obtained by allowing the _ b_-bosons to form extended tubes @xcite along a direction perpendicular to the lattice .",
    "such species dependent traps have been demonstrated experimentally by using state - selective optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the last ingredient is the possibility to tune both interaction among _ a_-bosons and _ b_-bosons , at the same time ensuring that _ b_-bosons do not interact .",
    "this requires an accurate choice of the species representing the bosons .",
    "for example one could choose @xmath23k-@xmath24cs mixture that has the necessary hyperfine structure accompanied by a rich landscape of feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "we provide in the appendix , two different schemes using periodic shaking mechanisms of the optical lattice that allow to generate the hamiltonian , eq .  , after time - averaging .",

    "the effective potential for the _ b_-bosons depends on a linear combination of occupations around the shaded plaquettes @xmath25 containing the sites @xmath26 for odd @xmath27 .",

    "therefore , by performing a duality transformation , we can go back to the original lattice and write the spin model as a gauge theory .",
    "since originally involves only every second plaquette , the lattice , where the gauge theory is defined , is a coarse - grained version of the original lattice made by grouping together @xmath45 plaquettes inside the @xmath46 squares as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1](b ) . as a result ,",
    "from now on , the plaquette index @xmath25 denotes the entire @xmath45 plaquettes group .",
    "we reverse the standard duality between gauge and spin systems @xcite and define the electric - field operator @xmath47 on the links of the coarse grained lattice .",
    "similarly @xmath48 . by construction ,",
    "the electric - field operators obey gauss law : @xmath49 .",
    "the relation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be inverted in several ways , one possibility is @xmath52 . under the same duality transformation , the plaquette magnetic field",

    ", the decay of electric field correlations can be measured by looking at the visibility of fringes for interfering clouds .",
    "moreover , the @xmath57-field configurations can be obtained directly through counting the particle number at each sites . in the context of ultracold atoms , those can be easily available through single - site measurements @xcite or by measuring the @xmath58-momentum particle density of a time - of flight image of a plaquette .",
    "such correlations are important and perhaps unique to probe spin - liquid correlations like coulomb correlations ( power law decay of the gauge fields ) or gapped spin - liquid correlations ( exponential decay ) of photon phase .",
    "moreover , magnetic field correlations can clearly distinguish between the spin - liquid phases of the present work and standard superfluid or mott - insulating phases , where @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "we look for weak coupling phases of the hamiltonian ( whose kinetic part also appears in eq .  ) .",
    "when @xmath62 , only the first term in eq .   survives , and the ground state is given by a state with no magnetic charge , i.e , @xmath63 .",
    "this state corresponds to the charge sector @xmath64 in eq .  .",
    "in the presence of a small non - zero coupling strength @xmath65 , first excited states consist of frustrating two @xmath66 s from the same column in order to fulfill charge conservation .",
    "we can construct two families of delocalized excitations .",
    "the first family contains two frustrated plaquettes in the same column having magnetic charge of unit @xmath67 as shown in fig.[figure2](a ) .",
    "an example of the magnetic charge state is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 so that the charges are from the same column and @xmath70 is the state with no magnetic charge .",
    "such magnetic charge states are created and de - localized by the action of the first row of the kinetic part of the hamiltonian in eq .. it is thus natural to consider both @xmath71 in the same column @xmath72 , and study the energy of the maximally de - localized state of a column @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the lattice size .",
    "the corresponding excitation energy is given by @xmath75 with @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "the other family of states contains the magnetic dipole states oriented along @xmath78 : @xmath79 in particular we can again consider the zero momentum state @xmath80 that has an excitation energy @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , one could construct magnetic dipoles oriented along @xmath82-direction with the opposite sign in the exponent . as opposed to magnetic charges , the dipoles delocalize by tunneling along both lattice directions due to the last two terms in the hamiltonian as pictorially sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) .    for @xmath83 ,",
    "the zero momentum magnetic dipole state has lower energy than the magnetic charge state for all coupling strength .",
    "thus for @xmath84 and for a very weak coupling the lower excitations are magnetic charge states and the ground state is similar to the one of the deconfined phase of the corresponding standard gauge theories .",
    "this can be seen by measuring the expectation value of the wilson loop @xcite , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a closed loop on the lattice .",
    "the deconfined phase is characterized by @xmath87 $ ] where @xmath88 stands for the perimeter of the loop @xmath86 .",
    "this means that the expectation value of wilson loop in the coarse - grained lattice decays to zero exponentially fast with the perimeter of the loop . as a consequence ,",
    "the weak coupling phase is a topological phase , and _",
    "b_-bosons are thus strongly entangled @xcite as opposed to the standard mott - insulating phase .",
    "we now focus on the scenario where dipoles have lower energy than magnetic charges .",
    "here we can write the ground state for small @xmath65 as @xmath89 .",
    "as a consequence , the expectation value of the rectangular wilson loop ( see fig .  [ figure2](c ) ) ( @xmath86 ) of width @xmath90 and height @xmath91 is @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "we call this phase _ dipole - deconfined _ since the first excited state is made of delocalized magnetic dipoles . a footprint of this phase is that the wilson loop expectation value only decays exponentially fast in the horizontal width of the enclosed area .    as @xmath65 increases the energy gap to the magnetic dipole state closes and signals a transition to a new phase",
    ". the new phase should be dominated by magnetic dipoles , as the perturbative study at small @xmath65 suggests .",
    "furthermore , we connect the gauge hamiltonain in eq . to the partition function of a gas of dipoles ( see methods ) .",
    "the partition function reads in @xmath93 diemsnion , @xmath94 where @xmath95 are integers and represent the strength of a magnetic dipole at site @xmath5 and the dipolar interaction arise from the inverse distance scaling of the coulomb interaction . for @xmath96 reads , @xmath97 .",
    "it is known that dipoles do not get screened at large distances @xcite so that we envisage the presence of a gapless phase , where dipoles interact with massless photons . a full characterization of this exotic phase goes beyond our present scope , and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we now check the physics at strong coupling with @xmath99 .",
    "the standard strongly coupled @xmath34 gauge theory is gapped due to confined electric - flux tubes between charges @xcite . in our case , as a consequence of the extra symmetries generated by the @xmath100 in eq .",
    "the ground state at strong coupling is highly degenerate .",
    "indeed any choice of constant @xmath33 in the @xmath101 direction , @xmath102 minimizes at @xmath98 .",
    "this means that in a @xmath74 lattice we have @xmath103 degenerate ground states .",
    "we can label these states by the value of the constant @xmath51 operator of the plaquettes in a given column @xmath104 @xmath105 and see that the ground state becomes @xmath106 we can construct a column fourier basis @xmath107 .",
    "in particular we can see that the ladder operator for the @xmath105 is given by @xmath108 .",
    "if we now consider a large but finite @xmath65 , the ground state degeneracy splits for finite systems .",
    "the ladder operator for @xmath105 can be only obtained at order @xmath109 of the perturbation theory .",
    "so we expect that the ground state is @xmath110 and all other @xmath111 states should still be exponentially close .",
    "the first excited state ( see fig .  [ figure2](d ) ) is again made of a manifold of states where one of the column state is changed from @xmath105 to @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are two different eigenvalues of the @xmath51 operator .",
    "these states have a gap of order @xmath115 over the ground state manifold .",
    "interestingly these excitations are localized in the @xmath19 direction , since once more their hopping only arises at order @xmath43 of the perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless there is no energy cost related to separating two of them in the @xmath19 direction so that they are energetically deconfined .",

    "this results in a drastic change of the phases of the gauge hamiltonian as two dimensional coulomb gas allows for gapless free photons .",
