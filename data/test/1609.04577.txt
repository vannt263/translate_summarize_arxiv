    "the least action principle of maupertuis provides the geodesics of particle trajectories .",
    "however it is generally of interest to focus on particle paths having a fixed energy @xmath0 .",
    "this was achieved by jacobi in an ingenious way by demonstrating that a regulated form of least action principle exists in which the variation is performed with modified form of metric , that later came to be known as jacobi metric .",
    "this metric itself and subsequently the geodesics became parametrized by the particle energy @xmath0 .",
    "hence one can fix attention on a restricted class of particle trajectory having constant energy .    for a generic lagrangian of the form , @xmath1 it was shown by jacobi that the constrained motion of a particle with energy @xmath0 is provided by geodesics of the rescaled metric @xmath2",
    "it is interesting to observe that particle interactions can induce a curvature in the jacobi metric through the potential function in an otherwise flat newtonian space .",
    "one of the early workers in this topic was ong @xcite who considered many body systems and in particular showed that the gaussian curvature of the jacobi metric has opposite sign to the particle energy @xmath0 ( non - relativistic , without the rest energy ) .",
    "in later times gibbons and coworkers @xcite have considered the optical metric in various physical situations which is a closely related concept for massless particles .",
    "discussions on jacobi metric approach in modern perspective can be found in @xcite .",
    "again very recently the jacobi metric formalism in relativistic scenario has been applied by gibbons @xcite in an elegant study of massive particle motion in schwarzschild spacetime . in the present paper",
    "we closely follow and extend this work to massive particle motion in reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "we consider both cases of the probe particle being neutral and charged .",
    "the results show a qualitative difference between the two cases since in the latter one needs to consider the additional coulomb interaction term between the source and probe particle . for neutral particle",
    "the correction terms depend on @xmath3 , @xmath4 being the charge of the black hole but interestingly for the charged probe correction terms involve @xmath5 terms as well , @xmath6 being charge of the particle , showing that the relative sign between the particle and black hole charge becomes important .    for the generic metric @xmath7",
    "the action for a massive particle in this background can be written as , @xmath8 the canonical momentum @xmath9 leads to the hamiltonian    @xmath10    this provides the hamilton - jacobi equation for the geodesics , parameterized by the energy @xmath0 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian - jacobi equation for geodesics of jacobi - metric @xmath13 is given by , @xmath14 where @xmath13 is defined as @xmath15 infact @xmath16 turns out to be the optical or fermat metric . for massless particles @xmath17 the jacobi metric becomes equal to the fermat metric modulo a factor of @xmath18 and subsequently the geodesics do not depend upon energy e. however in the massive case , @xmath19 , the geodesics are @xmath0-dependent .",
    "let us put our work in its proper perspective .",
    "the explicit results and observations of the present work are not entirely new . some of these are discussed in the book by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "a recent paper in this connection is @xcite .",
    "however we have studied the system from the jacobi metric point of view .",
    "the jacobi metric construction for charged massive particle and the subsequent analysis is completely new .",
    "in particular the interplay between the gravitational and coulomb forces proves to be interesting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 deals with the neutral massive particle motion in reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "section 3 constitutes the main body of our work - motion of charged massive particle in reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "the paper ends with our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "reissner - nordstrm metric is a spherically symmetric solution of the coupled maxwell einstein gravity .",
    "it represents a black hole with a mass m and a charge q and is given by @xmath20 for @xmath21 the schwarzschild metric is recovered . as is well known it has two horizons at @xmath22 .",
    "the nature of the horizon singularities are different in reissner - nordstrm and schwarzschild geometries .",
    "the latter is spacelike whereas the former is timelike and thus yielding richer possibilities regarding the nature of trajectories .",
    "there are timelike worldlines for particles that can cross @xmath23 horizon and skirting the singularity can move out to another spacetime region after crossing @xmath24 . on the contrary for schwarzschild geometry , after crossing the event horizon at @xmath25 the particle has no option but to fall towards the singularity",
    ". the @xmath23-horizon acts like the @xmath25 event horizon of schwarzschild whereas @xmath24-horizon is termed as the cauchy horizon .",
    "now , generalizing the result of gibbons @xcite , the jacobi metric corresponding to reissner - nordstrm solution is @xmath26\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first part is the conformal factor whereas the second factor is the optical metric .",
    "due to spherical symmetry , we are allowed to study the system in the equatorial plane @xmath27 without any loss of generality .",
    "this reduces the jacobi metric to the form , @xmath28\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of axial symmetry @xmath29 is a cyclic coordinate so that the angular momentum @xmath30 is conserved , @xmath31 now , together with ( [ a10 ] ) , ( [ b1 ] ) yields @xmath32 = 1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that can be rewritten as @xmath33 this satisfies the standard result , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the proper time along geodesic and the angular momentum is @xmath36 for @xmath37 incidentally the above relation connects the proper time @xmath38 to the jacobi path length @xmath39 .",
    "conventionally the trajectory is expressed in terms of a new variable @xmath40 : @xmath41 where , for the reissner - nordstrm case , we find , @xmath42 in the above @xmath43 is the conserved angular momentum per unit mass . thus ( [ e7],[e8 ] ) constitute the particle worldline or trajectory equation .",
    "it is straightforward to solve ( [ e7 ] ) and generate the following first order differential equation , @xmath44 where , c is a constant related to the energy per unit mass @xmath45 by @xmath46 this constitutes the first integral of motion and is one of our major results .",
    "incidentally @xmath47 is the impact parameter .",
    "we immediately notice a qualitative change the black hole charge has brought about in the trajectory . in comparison to the schwarzshild case @xcite",
    "the present result involves a quartic term in @xmath48 . writing the quartic polynomial in terms of roots , @xmath49 the following identities",
    "are recovered , @xmath50 clearly these are extensions of analogous relations given in @xcite for the schwarzshild metric .",
    "our aim is to propose explicit solutions for the trajectories in the same manner as those derived in @xcite . to that end",
    "let us quickly recapitulate the orbit equation for schwarzschild black hole @xcite , @xmath51 with the explicit solution , @xmath52 the constant parameters @xmath53 are given in appendix , with the subscript @xmath54 standing for the gibbons solution @xcite .",
    "now an explicit solution for the trajectory equation for reissner - nordstrm case ( [ b11 ] ) studied here is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 all are constants .",
    "one can solve for the constants perturbatively for small @xmath4 to first non - trivial order in @xmath3 .",
    "the result is given in the appendix .",
    "this constitutes one of our new results .",
    "let us construct circular orbits for which @xmath57 , a constant .",
    "we rewrite ( [ b11 ] ) as , @xmath58 presence of a biquadratic term of @xmath48 in @xmath59 , compared to a cubic one in schwarzschild geometry , is the qualitative change that leads to significant difference only for the orbits that cross the event horizon at @xmath23 and can skirt the singularity and come out of @xmath60 , ( as discussed earlier ) , instead of terminating at the singularity at @xmath61 as in the case of schwarzschild black hole ( see for example @xcite for details ) .    for the occurrence of circular orbits the conditions are as follows , @xmath62 @xmath63 the relations change for the null geodesics which we are not considering at present ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we can easily obtain the expressions for energy and angular momentum of a circular orbit of radius @xmath64 from the above two equations .",
    "the expressions are , @xmath65 and , @xmath66    the minimum radius for a stable circular orbit will occur at the point of inflexion of the function @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath67 eliminating @xmath68 from the above equation using ( [ z5 ] ) we obtain , @xmath69 or , in terms of @xmath70 , @xmath71    from ( [ z8 ] ) , for @xmath72 , we recover the well known result for schwarzschild geometry , @xmath73 .",
    "however , neglecting @xmath74 , a leading order correction to the radius is easily obtained , @xmath75    using ( [ z2 ] ) , ( [ z3 ] ) and ( [ z6 ] ) , ( [ z1 ] ) takes the form , @xmath76 and the solution is given by , @xmath77    for reissner - nordstrom case , upto @xmath78 we obtain @xmath79",
    "the next level of generalization is to consider the trajectory of a probe with charge @xmath6 in the presence of a charged black hole .",
    "indeed this is a non - trivial extension to the previous case since an additional coulomb interaction term of the form @xmath80 is involved . in reissner - nordstrom geometry where a test particle has a charge per unit mass @xmath6 , the only non vanishing component of the vector potential is @xmath81 and its motion is determined by the lagrangian as of the form , @xmath82 + 2\\frac{qq}{r}\\frac{dt}{d\\tau }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , we need not attempt to construct a generalized reissner - nordstrm solution starting from the einstein - maxwell point charge action .",
    "the jacobi metric formalism provides a quick answer .",
    "thus for the reissner - nordstrm case with a charged probe , the jacobi is given by @xmath83   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the only distinct feature which arises due to the probe charge @xmath6 in this case is that the energy for a particle ( having a turning point ) that arrives at the event horizon will be , @xmath84 and this can be be negative if @xmath85 which gives rises to the theoretical speculation of generating energy from a black hole . once again",
    "a restriction of the motion to the equatorial plane , i.e. @xmath86 , reduces the jacobi metric to @xmath87.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in an identical fashion , as done in previous cases , we derive the trajectory equation for @xmath40 , @xmath88 where @xmath43 is the conserved angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath89 is a constant related to the energy per unit mass @xmath45 and the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath90 is by the relation @xmath91    as we are considering upto the first order correction terms of @xmath3 so we can drop the @xmath92 term from ( [ c6 ] ) in our approximation .",
    "the solution of ( [ c6 ] ) can be written as , @xmath93 where @xmath56 all are constant and their approximate expressions are once again provided in the appendix .",
    "the trajectory equation for the charged probe is , @xmath94 this is the other principal result of our paper .    for the occurrence of circular orbits the conditions are as follows , @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "we can easily obtain the expressions for energy and angular momentum of a circular orbit of radius @xmath64 from the above two equations .",
    "the expressions for energy is , @xmath97}{1 - 3mu_c+2q^2u_c^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now upto the term of order @xmath5 approximately ( ignoring the term @xmath98 ) , the expression can be written as , @xmath99\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly for angular momentum , @xmath100 thus , upto order of @xmath5 , @xmath101\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is an interesting observation regarding a possible scaling of the charges following @xcite where variations of @xmath102 and @xmath103 against @xmath104 are discussed with the scaling @xmath105 , @xmath106 being a numerical constant .",
    "the resulting relation for the latter for neutral probe is @xcite @xmath107 however if we consider an identical scaling in our present case of with a charged probe , the relation turns out to be , @xmath108.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] appearance of the parameter @xmath109 is indicative of the fact that the coulomb force is essentially non - geometric and hence the trajectories are not pure geodesic in nature .",
    "the effect of the probe charge , especially whether it is of same or opposite sign as the black hole charge , is quite striking .",
    "intuitively we can argue that for the opposite sign case the probe charge effect will not be very significant because both the gravitational force and coulomb force will be attractive and so qualitatively similar behavior to the neutral case will be observed .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 .",
    "on the other hand , if the probe and black hole charges are of same sign the coulomb force will be repulsive whereas the gravitational force is attractive as before .",
    "interplay between these two forces produces an upper bound of the @xmath109 parameter above which the results become unphysical .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure 2 .",
    "similar behavior for @xmath110 vs. @xmath111 is observed in figure 3 and in figure 4 where , negative and positive values of @xmath109 are considered respectively .     vs. @xmath111",

    "considering @xmath6 and @xmath124 to be small ( which is quite natural ) we find @xmath125 this shows that the effective charge of the black hole increases for positive @xmath124 that is when the probe charge @xmath6 and black hole charge @xmath4 are of same sign but it decreases when they are of opposite sign .",
    "in the present work we have considered particle trajectories that are parameterized by constant energy value . this feature helps to visualize quickly the bounded and unbounded nature of particle orbits related to particle energy .",
    "this characteristics is very succinctly incorporated in the jacobi extension of least action principle .",
    "the formalism starts with the construction of the jacobi metric where the ( conserved ) particle energy appears explicitly in the metric . as has been proved by ong @xcite a restricted variational principle @xmath126 maupertuis with conventional metric and constant particle energy is equivalent to an unrestricted variational principle with jacobi metric , which explicitly involves the particle energy .",
    "hence the constant energy paths are still geodesics but of the jacobi metric .    exploiting this formalism",
    "we have studied the worldlines of both uncharged and charged probes in reissner nordstrom background .",
    "the former is a straightforward generalization of the schwarzschild black hole as given by gibbons @xcite whereas the latter is a non - trivial extension since it has an additional coulomb interaction . in both cases",
    "we have derived the circular orbit condition .",
    "the relative sign of the the probe and black hole ( whether both have same sign or opposite sign ) plays a significant role in determining nature of particle trajectory .    in ong s work @xcite gaussian curvature of the jacobi metric played an important role in characterizing the nature of the particle worldlines in terms of open or closed orbits related to the sign of particle energy .",
    "the construction was essentially non - relativistic in nature .",
    "it would be worthwhile to see the role of gaussian curvature in relativistic scenarios with schwarzschild or reissner - nordstrm spacetime in describing particle orbits .",
