    "the hot gas in clusters of galaxies seems like it should be easy to understand . because of the relatively low ratio of baryons to dark matter ,",
    "the potential well of a cluster should be dark - matter dominated .",
    "the dynamical time within a cluster potential is shorter than a hubble time , so most clusters should be relaxed . also , the cooling time of the vast majority of intracluster gas is longer than a hubble time .",
    "it would appear that cluster structure ought to be scale - free , as long as the shape of a cluster s potential well does not depend systematically on its mass .",
    "if that were the case , then the global properties of clusters , such as halo mass , luminosity - weighted temperature , and x - ray luminosity , would scale self - similarly ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "in particular , the gas temperature would scale with cluster mass as @xmath0 and the bolometric x - ray luminosity would scale with temperature as @xmath1 in the bremsstrahlung - dominated regime above @xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "numerical simulations that include gas dynamics but exclude non - gravitational processes such as radiative cooling and supernova heating produce clusters that obey these scaling laws ( e.g. , evrard , metzler , & navarro 1996 ; bryan & norman 1998 ; thomas 2001b ) .",
    "real clusters are not so simple .",
    "we have known for a decade that the observed luminosity - temperature relation is closer to @xmath3 ( e.g. , edge & stewart 1991 ) , indicating that non - gravitational processes must influence the density structure of a cluster s core , where most of the luminosity is generated ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; bryan & norman 1998 ) .",
    "the mass - temperature relation , on the other hand , seemed like it ought to be more fundamental and less sensitive to non - gravitational effects .",
    "yet , observations collected over the last few years indicate that this relation also disagrees with both the scale - free predictions and simulations that exclude non - gravitational processes ( horner , mushotzky , & scharf 1999 ; nevalainen , markevitch , & forman 2000 ; finoguenov , reiprich , & bhringer 2001 ; xu , jin , & wu 2001 ) .",
    "these results derive mostly from resolved x - ray and temperature profiles coupled with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , but they do seem consistent with gravitational lensing measurements ( allen , schmidt , & fabian 2001 ) .",
    "understanding the scaling properties of clusters is of broad importance because these scaling laws are integral to determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , the number density of clusters in the local universe reflects the amplitude of matter perturbations on @xmath4 mpc scales ( e.g. , henry & arnaud 1991 ; white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; kitayama & suto 1997 ; oukbir & blanchard 1997 ; henry 2000 ) . in order to measure this amplitude",
    ", one needs accurately measured cluster masses .",
    "gravitational lensing measurements of cluster mass have grown rapidly in sophistication during the last few years , but x - ray determined cluster temperatures , converted to cluster masses using the mass - temperature relation , remain the most commonly used mass measurement for cosmological studies .",
    "thus , any inaccuracies in the mass - temperature relation propagate into uncertainties in cosmological parameters derived from clusters ( e.g. , voit 2000 ) .",
    "a number of authors have recently re - evaluated the perturbation amplitude implied by cluster observations using a variety of techniques that circumvent the standard mass - temperature relation ( reiprich & bhringer 2001 ; van waerbeke 2001 ; seljak 2002 ; viana , nichol , & liddle 2002 ) .",
    "the results are disconcertingly different from those based on the standard relation , generally implying a much lower power - spectrum amplitude .",
    "clearly a better understanding of clusters is needed , and ideally , we would like to know how the present - day properties of clusters are linked to the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "the physical processes most likely to break the expected self - similarity of clusters are heating by supernovae or active galactic nuclei and radiative cooling , although other possibilities such as magnetic pressure or cosmic - ray pressure have not been ruled out .",
    "a large number of studies have investigated how the structure of the intracluster medium changes when these processes are included . because treating all of these processes in sufficient detail is extremely complicated , various approximations have been employed .",
    "these include numerical simulations that administer a particular amount of energy input at early times or adopt some other phenomenological prescription for injecting energy ( e.g. , metzler & evrard 1994 ; navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; metzler & evrard 1997 ; bialek , evrard , & mohr 2001 ; borgani et al .",
    "2001a ; da silva 2001 ; bryan & voit 2001 ) , analytical models for spherically symmetric accretion of preheated gas ( e.g. , cavaliere , menci & tozzi 1999 ; tozzi & norman 2001 ) , and semi - analytic models that consider the merger and star formation history of clusters ( e.g. , wu , fabian , & nulsen 1998 , 2000 ; balogh , babul , & patton 1999 ; bower 2001 ; babul , balogh , lewis , & poole 2002 ) .",
    "most of these papers have focused on heating of the gas , but recent work has also examined the possibility that radiative cooling is primarily responsible ( e.g. , knight & ponman 1997 ; suginohara & ostriker 1998 ; pearce 2000 ; bryan 2000 ; muanwong 2001 ; thomas 2001a ; lewis 2001 ) .",
    "two broad conclusions emerge from such studies : ( 1 ) radiative cooling without feedback probably locks too high a fraction of baryons into condensed objects , and ( 2 ) if heating is uniformly distributed , the amount required to produce realistic clusters is quite large , probably exceeding @xmath5 per baryon . introducing this much energy through supernova heating strains the bounds of plausibility , given how many",
    "metals are observed in the intracluster medium ( e.g. , balogh , babul , & patton 1999 ; valageas & silk 1999 ; kravtsov & yepes 2000 ; bower 2000 ; although see loewenstein 2000 ) .    here",
    ", we revisit an approach pioneered by bower ( 1997 ) , focusing on entropy as the most fundamental characteristic of the intracluster medium . analyzing clusters in terms of entropy",
    "has two advantages .",
    "the first is that convection within clusters acts as an entropy - sorting device , shuttling low - entropy material to the cluster core and high - entropy material to the cluster s outskirts .",
    "convective stability is achieved when specific entropy becomes a monotonically increasing function of radius .",
    "thus , if we can determine the entropy distribution of the gas in a cluster and we know the structure of its dark - matter halo , we can predict the structure of that cluster in its relaxed state . in the idealized cases that we will consider",
    ", we will assume that clusters are spherically symmetric , dark - matter dominated , in hydrostatic equilibrium , and in convective equilibrium .",
    "the second advantageous property of entropy is that , in the absence of non - gravitational processes , the entropy distribution of a cluster can be readily computed using either hydrodynamical simulations or spherically symmetric analytical models .",
    "then , the effects of non - gravitational heating and radiative cooling can be implemented as modifications of that entropy distribution .    in voit & bryan ( 2001 ) , we introduced a simple scheme for computing cluster models , taking advantage of these properties of the intracluster entropy distribution to show how heating and cooling conspire to produce a cluster @xmath6-@xmath7 relation quite similar to what is observed .",
    "this paper explores those modified - entropy models in more detail , showing that the observable properties of these model clusters are quite similar to those of real clusters on many counts .",
    "section 2 describes how we construct those models and analyzes how cluster properties depend on both halo concentration and entropy modification .",
    "section  3 uses relations between halo mass and halo concentration to define sets of cluster models determined entirely by the underlying cosmology .",
    "we then compare the model clusters with observations of the surface - brightness profiles of clusters , the temperature gradients of clusters , the mass - temperature relation , and the luminosity - temperature relation . in every case ,",
    "our models reproduce the observations , with little need for adjustable parameters . in section 4",
    ", we explore how the present - day intracluster entropy distribution emerges from hierarchical cosmological models .",
    "section  5 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in this section we develop a family of modified - entropy models of clusters based on two parameters , one specifying the concentration of the cluster s dark - matter halo and the other specifying the entropy level at which cooling and feedback modify the intracluster entropy distribution .",
    "we begin by casting the equilibrium equations in dimensionless form and selecting appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "then we assume that the unmodified entropy distribution determined by gravitational processes alone would produce a gas density distribution similar to the dark - matter density distribution . because the innermost gas in such a cluster can cool in much less than a hubble time",
    ", we proceed to investigate several potential modifications of the entropy distribution by radiative cooling and subsequent feedback . in each case , we show how both entropy modification and the shape of the underlying dark - matter halo affect the surface - brightness profile of a cluster , its luminosity - weighted temperature , its temperature gradient , and its x - ray luminosity .",
    "two important results emerge from this analysis : ( 1 ) the temperature of a cluster of a given mass is determined primarily by halo concentration and is affected only modestly by entropy modification , and ( 2 ) altering the intracluster entropy distribution at the scale set by radiative cooling leads to an @xmath8-@xmath7 relation that has the observed slope at @xmath9 and that evolves very little with time .",
    "the equilibrium structure of the intracluster medium is determined by three things , the gravitational potential of the cluster s dark matter , the entropy distribution of the cluster s gas , and the confining pressure at the outer boundary of the cluster . in order to solve for that structure",
    ", one must integrate the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and gas mass conservation , @xmath10 using the equation of state @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the adiabatic index and @xmath13 specifies the adiabat of the gas . in this system of equations",
    ", @xmath14 is the total mass within radius @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the gas mass within that radius , and the other symbols have their usual meanings . throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume that the gas mass is gravitationally negligible and that @xmath17 , as appropriate for an ideal monatomic gas .    in a sufficiently relaxed cluster",
    ", convection ensures that @xmath18 monotonically increases with radius .",
    "thus , if one knows @xmath19 , the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium expressed in terms of the mass of gas with @xmath20 , then one can use the inverse relation @xmath21 to solve the equilibrium equations that determine the cluster s structure . because this crucial quantity @xmath13 is so closely related to specific entropy",
    ", we will often refer to it as the `` entropy '' of the gas , even though the standard thermodynamic entropy per particle for an ideal monatomic gas is @xmath22      we can gain insight into the key parameters that control the structure of the intracluster medium by investigating a family of dimensionless models for clusters in hydrostatic and convective equilibrium . because the virial radius of a cluster lies close to the radius @xmath23",
    "within which the mean matter density of the cluster is 200 times the critical density @xmath24 , we elect to represent radii in terms of @xmath25 and gas density in terms of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the fractional contribution of baryons to the total mass of the universe .",
    "one can then rewrite the equilibrium equations in dimensionless form as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the virial mass , @xmath31 is the temperature in energy units is absorbed into @xmath7 throughout the paper .",
    "] of the corresponding singular isothermal sphere , @xmath32 $ ] is the dimensionless pressure , @xmath33 is the dimensionless mass within @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the fraction of a cluster s baryons in the intracluster medium within radius @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless entropy distribution is @xmath36 $ ] , and we will also make use of the quantity @xmath37 .",
    "general solutions to these equations can be found for a few idealized cases .",
    "for example , if the potential is a singular isothermal sphere and the gas is also isothermal , then we have @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for a monatomic ideal gas .",
    "if instead the mass profile follows the form of navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ; nfw hereafter ) , with @xmath41 $ ] where @xmath42 is the concentration parameter , then the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium becomes ( see wu , fabian , & nulsen 2000 ) @xmath43^{-1 }                             \\frac { d } { d\\hat{r } }                  \\left [ \\frac { \\ln ( 1+c\\hat{r } ) } { \\hat{r } } \\right ]                              \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ] given an isentropic gas in which @xmath44 we thus obtain @xmath45^{3/2}$ ] , where @xmath46 is a constant of integration .",
    "a particular solution to the equilibrium equations can be found by choosing @xmath47 and @xmath48 at the origin and integrating outwards .",
    "the gas mass fraction at the origin is always zero by definition , but there is some freedom in the choice of @xmath49 . any given choice of @xmath50 corresponds to a unique icm structure with a unique luminosity and temperature profile , but which solutions are the physical ones ?    here is where the confining pressure comes into play .",
    "it is generally assumed that accreting matter confines the icm in the neighborhood of @xmath23 .",
    "the pressure at @xmath23 would then be determined by the ram pressure of the infalling matter .",
    "now suppose that @xmath51 has been modified by non - gravitational processes .",
    "for example , heating might drive gas out of the cluster potential , pushing the accretion shock to a radius beyond @xmath23 .",
    "alternatively , cooling and condensation might reduce the total gas mass of the intracluster medium so that the accretion shock moves inward . in either case the radius at which the integration of hydrostatic equilibrium should terminate differs from @xmath23 .    so what is the termination radius @xmath52 at which @xmath53 equals the total uncondensed gas mass , and what is the pressure at that radius ? in a freely falling accretion flow with a constant mass flux , the density should vary as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the free - fall velocity from @xmath56 in an nfw potential .",
    "we therefore assume that the accretion pressure scales with radius as @xmath57 , and we normalize that pressure to equal the unmodified nfw value ( see   [ unmod ] ) at @xmath58 .",
    "various choices of @xmath59 will lead to pressure profiles that intersect @xmath60 at different values of @xmath61 , each corresponding to a unique value of @xmath62 determined by a particular integration .",
    "the correct solution is the one that gives the proper value for the uncondensed gas mass at the radius where the gas pressure equals the accretion pressure .    in practice ,",
    "the physically reasonable solutions are not particularly sensitive to the outer boundary condition . in the models that follow ,",
    "applying the boundary condition @xmath63 at @xmath58 would lead to similar results .",
    "however , the value of @xmath48 derived at @xmath64 using this boundary condition is not physically significant and can even be inconsistent with models in which cooling and condensation significantly reduce the maximum value of @xmath48 .",
    "one example of a physically _ unreasonable _ boundary condition is requiring @xmath65 at @xmath58 .",
    "such a requirement does not allow intracluster gas to expand beyond @xmath23 even when heating substantially raises the intracluster entropy . in the limit of extreme heating ,",
    "this condition therefore artificially boosts the central pressure , density , and temperature , leading to an unphysically large cluster luminosity .",
    "once a correct solution has been identified , one can compute two quantities that correspond to the dimensionless luminosity and luminosity - weighted temperature : @xmath66 as long as the cooling function @xmath67 remains sufficiently constant within the gas contributing the bulk of the luminosity , the actual luminosity - weighted temperature is @xmath68 , and the bolometric x - ray luminosity is @xmath69 where @xmath70 . scaling to a 10  kev cluster at @xmath9 gives @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the emission - measure profile and emissivity - weighted temperature profile are also of interest .",
    "thus , we define the following dimensionless analogs as functions of the projected radius @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the dimensionless distance along the line of sight .      before exploring the consequences of modifying the entropy of intracluster gas",
    ", we need to know what the entropy distribution would be if it were not modified . to simplify matters",
    ", we will assume that the underlying dark matter profile of the cluster is of nfw form with some concentration parameter @xmath42 .",
    "this parameter typically ranges from @xmath76 for hot clusters to @xmath77 for groups of galaxies ( see   [ conparam ] ) .",
    "if the intracluster medium were collisionless , then its density profile would be identical to that of the dark matter .",
    "thus , we define the unmodified entropy distribution @xmath78 of a cluster of concentration @xmath42 to be that of gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in the cluster potential with a density profile identical to that of the dark matter .",
    "numerical experiments reveal that the entropy distribution of intracluster gas in clusters simulated without radiative cooling or supernova heating is quite similar to the nfw form throughout most of the cluster but is elevated above nfw within the cluster s core .",
    "figure  [ denprofs ] shows the density distribution of a cluster simulated with an adaptive - mesh refinement code ( norman & bryan 1998 ; bryan 1999 ) for the santa barbara cluster comparision project ( frenk 1999 ) .",
    "the dotted line labeled `` nfw '' shows an nfw density distribution with @xmath79 , which is very close to the underlying dark - matter distribution of the cluster .",
    "the dashed line labeled `` simulation '' shows the gas - density distribution from that same simulation .",
    "agreement is quite close outside 10% of the virial radius , but the gas density levels off within that radius , implying that the lowest - entropy gas has a somewhat higher entropy than assumed in our unmodified distribution @xmath80 .",
    "however , this discrepancy at the low - entropy end of the distribution is inconsequential to the modified - entropy models that follow because the entropy of the discrepant gas will always be subject to further modification .",
    "the unmodified distribution is also somewhat discrepant with simulations at the high - entropy end .",
    "assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and an nfw gas - density law near the virial radius leads to gas temperatures that are 20 - 30% higher than those in our fiducial simulation .",
    "thus , our unmodified entropy levels at large radii are slightly higher than what a numerical simulation would produce .",
    "however , in order to properly reproduce the density profile near the virial radius in a hydrostatic model , we must retain these elevated entropy levels .",
    "this overestimate at the cluster s outskirts has virtually no effect on emissivity - weighted global quantities , such as @xmath6 and @xmath81 , but if one    is interested in the temperature of cluster gas near @xmath23 , then departures from hydrostatic equilibrium , which are outside the scope of our models , must be taken into account .",
    "modification of this baseline entropy distribution is inevitable because clusters simulated without radiative cooling are physically inconsistent . in general",
    ", the gas at the center of such a simulated cluster can radiate many times its thermal energy within a hubble time , resulting in cluster luminosities that vastly exceed those observed ( e.g. , muanwong 2001 ; bryan & voit 2001 ) . condensation and removal of the lowest - entropy gas from the intracluster medium must happen at some level , because that is how the cluster s galaxies form stars .",
    "furthermore , the most massive of these stars must explode , resulting in supernova feedback . condensed gas accreting onto an active galactic nucleus can provide additional feedback ( heinz , reynolds , & begelman 1998 ; kaiser & alexander 1999 ; quilis , bower , & balogh 2001 ; reynolds , heinz , & begelman 2002 ; bhringer 2002 ) .",
    "all of these processes will modify the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium , but modeling them in detail is a daunting task .",
    "because the physics of feedback is so complex , we shall adopt a highly simplistic phenomenological approach to entropy modification .",
    "instead of trying to model all the consequences of heating and cooling we will restrict our investigation to three qualitatively different modifications of the entropy distribution @xmath80 : ( 1 ) truncation of the distribution , ( 2 ) shifting of the distribution , and ( 3 ) radiative losses from the distribution .",
    "each of these modifications depends on a single entropy threshold parameter @xmath82 , which we take to be the entropy at which the cooling time of gas of temperature @xmath83 equals the age of the universe .",
    "thus , for each type of entropy modification , we obtain a two - parameter family of modified - entropy models specified by a concentration @xmath42 and a dimensionless entropy @xmath84 .    as in voit & bryan ( 2001 )",
    ", we use an approximate cooling function for gas with a metallicity of one - third solar to determine the appropriate entropy threshold . according to this approximation ,",
    "the threshold for cooling within 15  gyr can be expressed as @xmath85 with @xmath86 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 . converting this threshold to dimensionless units yields @xmath90 as long as @xmath91 ( see   [ emodtemp ] ) , then @xmath92 will be appropriate for the hottest clusters ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 will be appropriate for the coolest ( @xmath95 ) groups .",
    "one simple yet physically motivated way to modify the entropy distribution of intracluster gas is to truncate it at @xmath84 ( bryan 2000 ; voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "mathematically , we    define the truncated distribution to be @xmath96 where @xmath97 is defined by @xmath98 .",
    "such a modification corresponds to removing all the gas with a cooling time less than a hubble time and ignoring the effects of cooling on the rest of the intracluster medium .",
    "this type of modification can viewed either as an extreme form of cooling , in which all the gas below the critical threshold condenses , or an extreme form of heating , in which all the gas below the threshold is heated to very high entropy ( @xmath99 ) and convects beyond the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "figure  [ denprofs ] shows some gas density profiles resulting from different values of @xmath84 .",
    "the thin solid line labeled @xmath100 in figure  [ kdist ] shows the truncated entropy distribution for @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "notice that the maximum value of @xmath48 in these truncated models is less than unity because some of the gas has been removed from the intracluster medium .",
    "the thick solid line in figure  [ rmax ] illustrates how the fraction @xmath103 of a cluster s baryons that remain in the intracluster medium depends on @xmath84 . for hot clusters",
    "this fraction is @xmath10490% , but for cool groups it drops below 50% .",
    "nevertheless , the outer radius @xmath61 of the intracluster gas remains close to @xmath23 , even when @xmath105 drops below 0.5 .",
    "figure  [ denprofs ] shows the reason . as the entropy threshold for truncation rises , the central entropy of the cluster also rises",
    "the resulting density profile is therefore much flatter for large values of @xmath106 , enabling a smaller amount of gas +    to fill a similar volume .",
    "note also that the density profile of a modified - entropy model with @xmath101 and @xmath107 is quite similar to that of a @xmath79 cluster simulated without cooling and feedback , suggesting that the cooling threshold may have only a modest effect on the structure of the hottest clusters .",
    "another way to modify intracluster entropy is to add a constant term @xmath84 to the unmodified entropy distribution ( voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "this type of modification is a convenient way to mimic `` preheated '' models for cluster formation that inject a fixed amount of entropy per particle into the intergalactic medium at some early time . in this case , the modified entropy distribution is defined by @xmath108 the dotted line in figure  [ kdist ] shows this distribution for @xmath79 and @xmath102 . because entropy has been added but no gas has been removed , the outer radius for models with a shifted entropy distribution extends beyond the usual virial radius ( see figure  [ rmax ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , this corresponds to heating that inflates the intracluster medium , driving the accretion shock to larger radii .    comparing the structure of shifted models to truncated models reveals interesting similarities .",
    "figure [ denprofs_all ] depicts the dimensionless density profiles for @xmath109 , 0.3 , and 1.0 in clusters with @xmath79 .",
    "the run of density with radius is virtually identical for the shifted and truncated models when @xmath109 and is still quite similar when @xmath102 .",
    "thus , for most of the interesting range of entropy thresholds , there is little observable difference between shifted models and truncated models .",
    "however , as @xmath84 rises to 1.0 , the density profile of the shifted model becomes noticeably flatter than that of the truncated model .",
    "similarity between the truncated and shifted models at the lower entropy thresholds arises because the unmodified entropy @xmath110 depends approximately linearly on @xmath48 for small @xmath106 .",
    "thus , shifting the distribution by @xmath84 and truncating it at @xmath84 both produce similar modified entropy distributions and therefore similar density , temperature , and pressure distributions in the inner regions of the cluster .",
    "that is why entropy modification by heating and cooling can have similar effects on the luminosity and temperature of clusters as long as they establish similar values of the minimum entropy .",
    "observations show that many clusters contain gas with a cooling time less than a hubble time ( fabian 1994 ) , motivating us to consider slightly more complicated modifications to the entropy distribution .",
    "radiative cooling reduces the the specific entropy of a gas parcel according to @xmath111 this entropy equation can be rewritten to eliminate the dependence on gas density : @xmath112 in general , the rate at which entropy declines will depend on the prevailing hydrodynamic conditions , standard examples being isobaric cooling or isochoric cooling .",
    "however , for the purposes of this toy model , let us assume that the right - hand side of this equation remains constant .",
    "we make this rather arbitrary assumption for two physical reasons .",
    "first , within the temperature range @xmath113 , the quantity @xmath114 is approximately constant .",
    "second , as gas settles within a nearly isothermal potential , work done by compression will attempt to maintain the temperature of that gas near the characteristic temperature of the halo .",
    "thus , we are motivated to use the following modification to represent radiative losses : @xmath115^{3/2 }                           - \\hat{k}_c^{3/2 } \\}^{2/3 } \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ] this modification corresponds to reducing the value of @xmath116 by the constant amount @xmath117 throughout the entropy distribution and discarding all the gas with @xmath118 .",
    "the short - dashed line in figure  [ kdist ] shows an example of the resulting distribution for @xmath79 and @xmath102 , and a similar line in figure  [ rmax ] shows how the maximum radius depends on @xmath84",
    ".    it will also be interesting to investigate a generalization of this radiative - loss model : @xmath119^{\\alpha }                           - \\hat{k}_c^{\\alpha } \\}^{1/\\alpha } \\ ; \\ ; , \\ ] ] in which the tunable parameter @xmath120 enables us to adjust the amount of gas below the cooling threshold . in the limit @xmath121",
    ", this generalized distribution becomes identical to the truncated distribution . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on the intermediate case of @xmath122 , represented by the symbol @xmath123 and long - dashed lines in the relevant figures .",
    "figure  [ denprofs_all ] compares the density distributions that result from the radiative - loss models with the truncated and shifted models . for @xmath109 ,",
    "all the density profiles are very similar at @xmath124 , because the entropy profiles are nearly identical there . however , within that radius , entropy in the radiative - loss models drops below @xmath84 , allowing for considerably greater compression and higher central density .",
    "this trend becomes more pronounced at higher @xmath84 because the proportion of the intracluster medium below the cooling threshold is even larger .",
    "modified - entropy models generated through shifts and truncations of the unmodified entropy distribution produce surface - brightness profiles that are strikingly similar to the @xmath125-model profiles of many real clusters , at least within about 30% of the virial radius .",
    "figure  [ sbright ] shows the dimensionless emission measure @xmath126 as a function of projected radius @xmath34 for three different truncated models , each with @xmath79 . as the threshold entropy progresses from @xmath109 , characteristic of clusters , through @xmath102 to @xmath127 , characteristic of groups ,",
    "the @xmath128 profile substantially flattens . as long as @xmath67 does not change dramatically with radius",
    ", these emission - measure profiles will be nearly identical to the surface - brightness profiles .    for comparision",
    ", figure  [ sbright ] also shows some @xmath125-model profiles selected to match the modified - entropy models .",

    "the emission    measures of the @xmath125-models exceed those of the modified - entropy models , but owing to the low surface brightness at large radii , the @xmath125-model parameters of clusters and groups have generally been measured within @xmath132 .",

    "results for truncated ( @xmath100 ) models are shown in figure  [ betafits_t ] , and those for shifted ( @xmath135 ) models are shown in figure  [ betafits_s ] . because the profiles in the shifted models tend to be shallower , the corresponding @xmath125 values are somewhat smaller , particularly for low values of @xmath84 .",
    "however , in both cases , the best - fitting @xmath125 values span the observed range for clusters and groups of galaxies ( see   [ sec - sbprofs ] ) .",
    "one consequence of raising the core entropy of a cluster is a boost in the luminosity - weighted temperature of the intracluster gas .",
    "figure  [ tprofs ] shows that increasing @xmath84 raises the temperature of gas at all radii in both the shifted and truncated models .",
    "amplification of the central temperature can be quite extreme , exceeding @xmath136 when @xmath84 rises to 1.0 . however , the resulting enhancement of the luminosity - weighted temperature is not nearly as dramatic .",
    "the value of @xmath137 turns out to depend more critically on the concentration parameter @xmath42 than on the entropy threshold , as demonstrated in figure  [ tlums_ts ] .",
    "the reason that raising the core entropy of gas in an nfw potential has only a modest effect on its luminosity - weighted temperature involves both the gas density profile    and the dark - matter density profile .",
    "extra entropy flattens the density profile of intracluster gas , diminishing the relative luminosity of gas in the core .",
    "the characteristic radius of gas contributing the bulk of the cluster s luminosity therefore moves outward .",
    "because the shape of an nfw halo is steeper than isothermal at @xmath138 , the characteristic temperature of gas within such a halo declines outside that radius ( see figure  [ tprofs ] ) .",
    "thus , the rise in gas temperature resulting from an increase in @xmath84 is largely offset by an increased contribution to the total luminosity from lower - temperature gas at larger radii .",
    "this effect is most pronounced in the shifted models , which have substantial amounts of relatively cool gas beyond @xmath58 . in those models , @xmath137 actually _ declines _ as @xmath84 approaches unity .",
    "the large central temperatures in the shifted and truncated cases also seem somewhat unrealistic in light of observations showing either level or radially increasing temperature gradients within cluster cores ( e.g. , arnaud 2001a , b ; allen 2001 ) . in order to compare these temperatures more directly with observations",

    "all of our schemes for entropy modification substantially lower the luminosities of clusters .",
    "figure  [ lints_8 ] shows how dimensionless luminosity @xmath146 depends on the entropy threshold @xmath84 for clusters with @xmath79 . in all cases , luminosity declines by over an order of magnitude as @xmath84 rises from 0.1 to 1",
    "this decline is shallowest for the shifted model because the additional gas at large radii contributes significantly to the total luminosity when @xmath147 .",

    "luminosity enhancement in the @xmath148 radiative - loss model is more moderate",
    " only a few tens of percent greater than in the truncated case .    analyzing how @xmath146 depends on @xmath84 leads to some important insights into how the cooling threshold determines the luminosity - temperature relation of clusters and groups .",
    "figure  [ lints_tx ] shows that @xmath149 is a good approximation to the @xmath146-@xmath84 relation for truncated models in the range @xmath150 .",
    "this scaling reflects the asymptotic slope of the nfw density profile .",
    "notice that the outer portions of the density profiles in figure  [ denprofs ] track the underlying nfw profile of the dark matter , and the inner portions are nearly isentropic with @xmath151 .",
    "one can therefore approximate the density profile of a truncated model by joining an isentropic density profile to an nfw profile at the radius @xmath152 at which the density of the unmodified nfw profile is @xmath153 .",

    "the luminosity from the nfw portion of the profile scales in the same way for the radii of interest .",
    "thus , for larger values of @xmath34 , where the density of the nfw profile approaches @xmath156 , we have @xmath157 .",
    "this particular scaling of @xmath146 with @xmath84 has some very interesting consequences .",
    "section  [ integrated ] showed that the physical luminosity of a cluster scales as @xmath158 . in order to substitute physical quantities for @xmath146",
    ", we need to recognize that @xmath159 and that @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the age of the universe .",
    "we therefore obtain @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the hubble constant at time @xmath161 .",
    "the following three features of this expression are particularly noteworthy :    * the power - law slope it predicts for the x - ray @xmath164 relation is very close to the observed slope of @xmath165 ( e.g. , markevitch 1998 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ) . because the halos of low - temperature groups have higher concentrations than high - temperature clusters ( see   [ conparam ] ) , we expect @xmath137 to decline by a factor @xmath166 as @xmath81 rises by an order of magnitude .",
    "this dependence on concentration steepens the power - law slope implied by equation ( [ ltscal ] ) to @xmath167 .",
    "* the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation does not depend on the form of the cooling function , which scales as @xmath168 in the free - free cooling regime at @xmath87 and as @xmath169 in the line - cooling regime at @xmath170 .",
    "if the entropy threshold in real clusters did not depend on @xmath171 , then we would expect a distinct steepening of the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation as @xmath7 rises through @xmath2 , which is not observed .",
    "equation ( [ ltscal ] ) is indepedent of @xmath171 because the dimensionless gas mass within @xmath152 scales @xmath172 , and thus remains approximately constant in an nfw halo for @xmath173 .",
    "the cooling time of that gas is @xmath174 , so its physical luminosity scales @xmath175 .",
    "this scaling law also applies to the entire cluster , because the luminosity of gas outside @xmath152 scales in lockstep with gas inside @xmath152 . applying the relation @xmath176 thus leads back to equation ( [ ltscal ] ) , except for the @xmath137 factor .",
    "* finally , the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation implied by equation ( [ ltscal ] ) changes very little with time , again in agreement with observations ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; donahue 1999 ; della ceca 2000 ; borgani 2001b ) .",
    "that happens because the mass of a cluster of a given temperature declines @xmath177 with increasing redshift .",
    "according to the @xmath178 scaling , the resulting decline in the intracluster gas mass compensates almost precisely for the drop in the cooling threshold owing to the shorter cooling time @xmath161 .",
    "this scaling breaks down at the low - temperature end , where @xmath179 , because the entire intracluster ( or intragroup ) medium in the truncated and shifted cases becomes effectively isentropic .",
    "then , the gas density determined by the cooling threshold is @xmath180 , and the luminosity from within @xmath23 scales as @xmath181 .",
    "thus , we should expect the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation for low - temperature halos to be steeper than for clusters , roughly @xmath182 for @xmath183 , and we should expect the luminosity of objects at a given temperature to increase with time .    in order to make further progress , we will need to understand how halo concentration depends on halo mass .",
    "the previous section explored the properties of dimensionless modified - entropy models for clusters depending on two parameters , the halo concentration parameter @xmath42 and an entropy - threshold parameter @xmath84 .",
    "as in voit & bryan ( 2001 ) , we argued that the crucial entropy threshold should be the entropy level at which intracluster gas would cool in a hubble time .",
    "now we will use a set of relations between halo concentration and halo mass to construct modified - entropy models for real clusters . in these models ,",
    "the halo mass @xmath184 determines the concentration parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the mass and halo concentration then set the temperature of the cluster , and this temperature sets the level of the entropy threshold @xmath82 .",
    "cluster properties are therefore determined primarily by the overall cosmological model , because it fixes the global baryon fraction , the relation between halo mass and concentration , and the hubble time that governs @xmath185",
    ". some of a cluster s properties , such as the temperature of the innermost gas , also depend on the chosen scheme for entropy modification .",
    "the properties of the resulting modified - entropy models turn out to be remarkably similar to those of observed clusters and groups .",
    "the section begins by defining the @xmath184-@xmath42 relations we will use and comparing them to some of the scarce data . then , we explore the structure of the intracluster medium in our modified - entropy cluster models , showing that the observed relationship between @xmath125 and @xmath81 may be more than just a selection effect and demonstrating how entropy modification can lead to temperature profiles similar to those observed in both the inner and outer regions of clusters .",
    "we go on to compare the mass - temperature relation from our modified - entropy models to observations , showing that the models reproduce the observational results of nevalainen ( 2000 ) and finoguenov ( 2001 ) .",
    "we also compare the @xmath8-@xmath81 relation from our models to cluster data , again showing excellent agreement .",
    "much of the dispersion of this relation , in both the models and the data , stems from differences in the amount of gas below the cooling threshold , and we conclude with some speculations about what governs these differences .      the concentration of a dark matter halo is determined by its formation history .",
    "early formation generally leads to a denser core and thus a higher concentration .",
    "low - mass halos , which tend to collapse earlier in time , are therefore expected to be somewhat more concentrated than high - mass halos . because a halo s collapse and merger history determines its concentration , the relation between concentration and halo mass depends on the underlying cosmological model , specified by the matter density @xmath186 , the dark - energy density @xmath187 , the normalization @xmath188 of the perturbation spectrum , and the shape of that spectrum , often parameterized by @xmath189 ( bardeen 1986",

    "our previous work on modified - entropy models and the cooling threshold demonstrated how well these models account for the observed slope and normalization of the cluster luminosity - temperature relation ( voit & bryan 2001 ) . that paper compared truncated and shifted modified - entropy models to cluster data that were corrected for the effects of cooling flows . here",

    "@xmath197 shifts the models to slightly lower temperatures , but the agreement with groups is almost as good . using shifted instead of truncated entropy distributions elevates the x - ray luminosity on group scales by a factor @xmath258 .    while there are essentially no free parameters in these models , the cluster luminosity does depend on our assumed value of @xmath186 .",

    "our models imply that groups are less suitable for such measurements because their baryon - to - dark - matter ratio within @xmath23 may be @xmath261% of the global value ( see figure  [ rmax ] ) .",
    "the tendency of the data at @xmath262 to scatter toward the low-@xmath8 , high-@xmath81 side of the model relations may be due to the same effects that cause similar scatter at those temperatures in the observed @xmath252-@xmath263 relation . figure  [ ltrel_t_sb ] shows how surface - brightness bias affects the luminosity - temperature relations derived from our models .",
    "raising the surface - brightness threshold within which luminosity and temperature are measured lowers @xmath8 while raising @xmath81 , producing the same trend seen in the data . measuring both of these quantities only within regions where @xmath264 produces relations that track the lower envelope of the group data . unlike the cluster measurements ,",
    "the data on groups have not been corrected for the effects of gas below the cooling threshold , which could counterbalance the surface - brightness bias by raising @xmath8 and lowering @xmath81 ( see figure [ ltrel_sb5e15 ] ) .",
    "we therefore suspect that the dispersion in the @xmath6-@xmath7 data of helsdon & ponman ( 2000 ) arises from a combination of differing surface - brightness biases and differing amounts of gas below the cooling threshold .    reproducing the behavior of clusters and groups with significant amounts of gas below the cooling threshold requires an additional parameter . in our models , that parameter is @xmath120 , which characterizes the slope of the entropy distribution function below the cooling threshold .",

    "our simplistic schemes for entropy modification treat clusters as if they were assembled very early in time , with some standard initial entropy distribution .",
    "in fact , the entropy history of the intracluster medium is likely to be far more complex , influenced in differing ways at various times by merger shocks , radiative cooling , and feedback .",

    "* incomplete relaxation .",
    "_ chandra _ observations of several clusters have revealed `` cold fronts '' thought to be evidence of low - entropy gas sloshing around in the cores of those clusters ( markevitch 2000 ; vikhlinin , markevitch , & murray 2001 ) .",
    "our models assume that the lowest - entropy gas in a cluster has already settled into hydrostatic equilibrium at the cluster s center .",
    "some of the apparent dispersion in @xmath120 could be due to differences in the degree to which low - entropy gas has settled within cluster cores following the last major merger . * recent feedback .",
    "cooling and condensation of low - entropy gas at the center of a cluster is likely to lead to star formation and perhaps enhanced activity in the nucleus of the central galaxy ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "both star formation and radio jets can provide feedback , imparting entropy to the cluster core that inhibits further condensation ( bhringer 2002 ) .",
    "perhaps these feedback processes control the value of @xmath120 . * thermal conduction .",
    "the presence of significant temperature gradients within the cores of some clusters has often been cited as evidence that magnetic fields strongly suppress electron thermal conduction in clusters ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of some particularly sharp cold fronts have reinforced that supposition ( ettori & fabian 2000 ) .",
    "however , these observations constrain conduction in only one dimension and do not necessarily rule out conduction in the other two dimensions .",
    "furthermore , recent theoretical work suggests that magnetic fields might not suppress conduction as effectively as previously believed ( malyshkin & kulsrud 2001 ; malyshkin 2001 ; narayan & medvedev 2001 ) .",
    "it is possible that the magnetic field geometry in a cluster s core places a lower limit on the value of @xmath120 .",
    "investigating all of these possibilities is beyond the scope of this paper , but in the next section we explore how one might self - consistently calculate the intracluster entropy distribution within a hierarchical merging scenario .",
    "we have shown that some very simple prescriptions for the entropy distribution in present - day clusters lead to a remarkably realistic set of cluster models . however , the astrophysics that leads to these entropy distributions is certainly more complicated than we have assumed .",
    "understanding how the the physics of structure formation , cooling , and feedback determine the intracluster entropy distribution will require a more complete theory based on hierarchical merging .",
    "this section outlines a few of the basic issues involved in constructing such a theory .      considering the entropy history of a single gas parcel",
    "affords some insight into how radiative cooling establishes an entropy threshold ( voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "suppose that the parcel begins with entropy @xmath268 in a halo of temperature @xmath269 at some early time @xmath270 . in a hierarchical merging scenario ,",
    "the parcel s halo will eventually merge with another halo at time @xmath271 .",
    "merger shocks will then raise the parcel s entropy to some new value @xmath272 , and as that parcel settles within the new halo , it will approach a new temperature @xmath273 , similar to the characteristic temperature of that new halo .",
    "each subsequent merger will also raise the parcel s temperature and entropy .",
    "thus , the trajectory of a parcel through the entropy - temperature plane can be schematically represented by a sequence of points like that in figure  [ entprop ] .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ entprop ] show how the entropy threshold associated with cooling rises with time until it achieves its present value , indicated by the solid line . as long as a parcel s trajectory through",
    "the entropy - temperature plane remains above the cooling threshold , then radiative cooling and subsequent feedback will not significantly affect that parcel s entropy .",
    "however , any parcel that spends a large fraction of time below that threshold will be subject to substantial entropy loss , condensation , and whatever feedback ensues .",
    "feedback can continue as long as there are gas parcels below the cooling threshold , but once cooling and feedback have eliminated all gas below the cooling threshold , feedback must cease .",
    "thus , the threshold for entropy modification established by both cooling and feedback corresponds to the cooling threshold defined by the hubble time @xmath274 .",
    "although cooling sets the threshold for entropy modification , the model we are describing is not a cooling - flow model .",
    "hierarchical structure formation will ensure that mergers disperse the products of condensation throughout the final cluster .",
    "stars and galaxies form out of the lowest - entropy gas long before the cluster itself forms . hence , much of the low - entropy gas that would eventually find its way into the cluster core in a simulation with no radiative cooling decouples from the intracluster medium before it can participate in a centrally - focused cooling flow . finally , for reasons we will describe next",
    ", a certain amount of feedback is needed to prevent the incipient intracluster medium from overcooling at high redshift .",
    "overcooling is one of the classic problems that models of hierarchical structure formation must overcome ( cole 1991 ; white & frenk 1991 ; blanchard , valls - gabaud , & mamon 1992 ; balogh 2001 ) .",
    "if radiative cooling were allowed to proceed unchecked as structure formed , then a substantial percentage ( @xmath275% ) of the universe s baryons would have been locked into condensed objects before the era of cluster formation . because the fraction of uncondensed baryons in present - day clusters is @xmath276% , feedback processes like supernova heating are presumed to inhibit cooling and condensation of high - redshift baryons ( white & rees 1978 ; cole 1991 ;",
    "white & frenk 1991 ) .    in our models",
    ", overcooling manifests itself as an entropy threshold @xmath82 that is much higher than the characteristic entropy of an unmodified high - redshift halo . to illustrate this effect ,",
    "let us assume that the progenitor halo of a present - day cluster has a temperature @xmath277 that depends on redshift .",

    "we can use extended press - schechter theory ( bond 1991 ; bower 1991 ) to approximate @xmath277 and estimate the temperature , entropy , and redshift scales at which overcooling is problematic .",
    "first , to demonstrate the principle with simple scaling relations , we consider a scdm ( @xmath282 ) universe with a power spectrum given by an @xmath283 power law . in that case",
    ", the characteristic mass scale evolves like @xmath284 , and assuming that @xmath285 yields @xmath286 . at low redshifts , where @xmath7 is high",

    "however , at high redshifts , when the progenitor temperature is smaller , we have @xmath169 and @xmath289 . thus , the progenitor of a halo with @xmath290 at @xmath291 would have @xmath292 at @xmath293 .",
    "figure  [ ent_evol ] illustrates this effect more precisely for a @xmath171cdm universe seeded by a power spectrum with shape parameter @xmath294 .",

    "the solid line shows the entropy threshold @xmath82 in that evolving halo for a metallicity of one - third solar .",
    "feedback must impart an entropy @xmath297 to prevent overcooling at @xmath298 .",
    "feedback can solve the overcooling problem , but it introduces another , more subtle problem into our framework .",
    "our modified - entropy models assume that gas above the cooling threshold follows the unmodified distribution @xmath78 .",
    "however , the need for feedback at early times implies that a large proportion of intracluster gas has experienced entropy modification at least once in its history .",
    "somehow , the process of cluster formation needs to restore the unmodified distribution to gas above the threshold at @xmath9 .",
    "exactly how that happens is unclear .",
    "consider what happens in a merger between two halos containing isothermal gas at temperatures @xmath269 and @xmath273 that collide at velocity @xmath299 .",
    "merger shocks with mach number @xmath300 will propagate through each halo s gas , raising the entropy of that gas by some more - or - less uniform factor depending on @xmath301 . this mechanism could potentially amplify the effects of early feedback , which must raise the intrahalo entropy to at least @xmath82 to avoid overcooling .",
    "subsequent shocks would then boost the entropy even further , along a path parallel to the dashed line in figure  [ ent_evol ] .",
    "if this mechanism dominates , then very little gas should remain near @xmath82 at @xmath302 .",
    "however , early feedback is likely to diminish the effects of mergers , particularly in gas with low entropy .",
    "if feedback raises all the gas in the progenitor halo of a cluster to @xmath303 , then the intrahalo medium will be nearly isentropic , with high - temperature gas at the center of the halo and lower - temperature gas at the outskirts ( see figure  [ tprofs ] ) .",
    "when mergers occur , mach numbers associated with lower - entropy gas in the halo s core will therefore be lower than those associated with higher - entropy gas near the virial radius .",
    "hence , merger shocks will act to steepen any entropy gradient that exists .",
    "dynamical friction may also add to this effect , because the cores of merging halos tend to lose orbital energy before they collide and merge .",
    "another effect to consider is the quasi - continuous accretion of gas associated with small halos , for which the mach number is likely to be quite high .",
    "this type of accretion will enhance the amount of high - entropy gas in the final cluster .",
    "thus , it seems possible that the modified - entropy models we have developed can successfully be linked with hierarchical structure formation , although many details remain to be worked out .",
    "several recent analyses of similarity breaking in groups and clusters have cast the problem in terms of energy rather than entropy ( e.g. , wu 1998 , 2000 ; lloyd - davies , ponman , & cannon 2000 ; loewenstein 2000 ; bower 2001 ; lloyd - davies 2002 ) .",
    "for example , if one knows what the configuration of the intracluster gas would be in the absence of non - gravitational heating and cooling processes , then one can opt to define the `` excess energy '' of a cluster s gas to be the difference in total energy between that unmodified configuration and the actual configuration . depending on what is assumed about the unmodified configuration",
    ", these excess energies can range from @xmath304 for groups ( e.g. , lloyd - davies 2000 , 2002 ) to over 2  kev for clusters ( e.g. , wu 2000 ) .",
    "the results of this paper indicate that some combination of heating and cooling is responsible for similarity breaking because cooling is needed to explain the core entropies of clusters and groups and heating is needed to prevent overcooling at early times .",
    "therefore , we prefer to compute excess energy in a way that explicitly accounts for the separate contributions of cooling and heating .",
    "first , we assume that the baseline state of a cluster of mass @xmath184 is a truncated model from which cooling and condensation has removed a fraction @xmath305 of the lowest - entropy gas . in other words ,",
    "the initial configuration of the intracluster medium has an entropy floor equal to @xmath306 and contains a fraction @xmath307 of the cluster s baryons .",
    "then , we assume that the final state of the cluster is a shifted model with the same proportion of baryons but an entropy floor equal to the cooling threshold , so that it obeys the observed @xmath246-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath7 relations .",
    "formally , the entropy distribution of the final state is @xmath308 with an outer boundary where @xmath309 . because the amount of hot baryonic gas in both models is the same , the amount of heat input required to explain the cluster scaling relations after a fraction @xmath305 of the intracluster gas has condensed equals the energy input needed to convert the initial configuration to the final configuration , including work done at the outer boundary of the intracluster medium .",
    "figure  [ xs_energy ] shows the energy difference between these configurations as a function of halo mass for different values of the condensed baryon fraction @xmath305 . to facilitate comparisons with other treatments of excess energy , we divide this energy difference by the total number of particles in an unmodified cluster ( @xmath310 ) , giving the quantity @xmath311 in units of kev per particle . when the condensed baryon fraction is small ( @xmath312 ) , the excess energy needed to account for the scaling relations of massive clusters ( @xmath196 ) approaches the @xmath313 level .",
    "however , this large amount of excess energy depends heavily on the assumed form of the unmodified entropy distribution , which is likely to be a poor approximation for these purposes .",
    "the large difference in the excess energy of massive clusters between models with @xmath312 and @xmath314 indicates that a large amount of energy is needed to lift the lowest - entropy gas out of the very center of the gravitational potential .",
    "yet , figure  [ denprofs ] shows that the unmodified intracluster density distribution is unlikely to be as centrally condensed as we have assumed . even in the absence    of cooling , the true unmodified profile probably corresponds more closely to a truncated model with @xmath315 , which substantially reduces the excess energy burden .",
    "thus , when calculating excess energies for clusters , one must make sure that the baseline model accurately represents the cluster configuration in the absence of heating .",
    "the curve with @xmath316 is likely to be a more realistic representation of the heat input needed to explain the scaling properties of massive clusters for two reasons : ( 1 ) this value of @xmath305 roughly corresponds to the fraction of cluster baryons that have condensed into stars , and ( 2 ) when @xmath317 , truncation eliminates the innermost part of the entropy distribution that is discrepant with simulations . at @xmath318",
    ", this excess energy curve suggests that only a fraction of a kev per particle is needed to explain cluster scaling relations .",
    "that is because a shifted model with an entropy shift determined by the cooling threshold is virtually identical to a truncated model with the innermost @xmath305 of gas removed .",
    "likewise , the mass scales at which curves with larger values of @xmath305 intercept the zero - energy level also indicate cases in which the truncated and shifted models are virtually identical , requiring no excess heating to produce the observed scaling relations . in the limiting case of zero supernova heating ( e.g. , bryan 2000 , muanwong 2001 ) ,",
    "these intercept points show the fraction of condensed baryons implied by the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation as a function of halo mass .",
    "if the condensed baryon fractions of groups are similar to those of clusters , then @xmath319 of excess energy is needed to explain the @xmath246-@xmath7 and @xmath6-@xmath7 relations at @xmath262 .",
    "the main difference between the initial configuration and the final configuration of groups with @xmath320 is that the gas in the final configuration is considerably more extended , with substantially more gravitational potential energy . because models with higher @xmath305 contain less intragroup gas , they are less extended , and less energy is needed to change their configuration .",
    "we note that the excess energy needs of groups are comparable to estimates of the supernova energy released over the course of the group s history ( e.g. , ponman 1999 , loewenstein 2000 ; pipino 2002 ) , which may mean that no other source of energy is needed to explain their scaling properties , if that energy efficiently heats the intragroup medium .",
    "the bottom line here is that calculations of the heat input needed to account for the scaling relations of clusters and groups depend critically on what is assumed to happen in the absence of heat input .",
    "most calculations of excess energy have assumed that the intracluster gas density obeys either a simple polytropic equation of state ( e.g. , wu 2000 ; loewenstein 2000 ) or a @xmath125-model density profile ( e.g. , bower 2001 ; lloyd - davies 2002 ) whose parameters are adjusted according to the amount of heat input .",
    "the modified - entropy models discussed in this paper allow for cooling and condensation of the lowest - entropy gas to occur before heat is added .",
    "figure  [ xs_energy ] demonstrates that the amount of heating needed to explain the scaling relations depends strongly on the amount of cooling that occurs prior to heat input and that realistic amounts of `` precooling '' substantially reduce the required amount of non - gravitational heating .",
    "a realistic family of models for clusters in hydrostatic and convective equilibrium can be constructed using the navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ) density profile and some rudimentary prescriptions for how radiative cooling and feedback induced by that cooling modify the entropy distribution of intracluster gas .",
    "the models presume that the intracluster entropy distribution in the absence of cooling and feedback would be identical to that of gas that takes on the same density distribution as the dark matter as it settles into the cluster s potential well  an assumption supported by numerical simulations .",
    "because the lowest - entropy gas within that distribution can cool within a hubble time , its entropy must somehow be modified .",
    "the threshold entropy in our prescriptions for entropy modification corresponds to the entropy at which the cooling time of intracluster gas equals the age of the universe .",
    "the prescriptions themselves include truncation of the entropy distribution at the threshold entropy , shifting of the entropy distribution by adding the threshold entropy to the entire distribution , and a qualitative implementation of radiative cooling .",
    "exploring the properties of dimensionless models depending only on the halo concentration @xmath42 , the dimensionless entropy threshold @xmath84 , and the prescription for entropy modification reveals that :    * removal of low - entropy gas acts to flatten the core density profile , regardless of whether cooling or heating eliminates that low - entropy gas ( see figures  [ denprofs ] and [ denprofs_all ] ) . * the observable properties of clusters depend more critically on the threshold entropy than on the mode of entropy modification . for example , truncation of the intracluster entropy distribution at a given value of @xmath84 and shifting of the entropy distribution by that same amount lead to very similar pressure , density , and temperature profiles within the cluster s virial radius ( see figures  [ denprofs_all ] and [ tprofs ] ) . * within about 30% of the virial radius , the surface - brightness profiles of truncated and shifted models are very similar to @xmath125-models ( see figure  [ sbright ] ) .",
    "raising the entropy threshold tends to lower the best - fitting value of @xmath125 , while raising the halo concentration tends to decrease the core radius ( see figures  [ betafits_t ] and [ betafits_s ] ) . *",
    "all of our prescriptions for entropy modification tend to augment the luminosity - weighted temperature of a cluster as the entropy threshold rises",
    ". however , that temperature increase is relatively small because the increased central entropy decreases the luminosity of high - temperature gas in the core .",
    "thus , modifiying the entropy of a cluster shifts the bulk of a cluster s luminosity to larger radii , where gas temperatures tend to be smaller , mitigating the effects of the entropy increase ( see   [ emodtemp ] ) . * all of our prescriptions for entropy modification reduce the x - ray luminosity of a cluster as the entropy threshold rises . in the high - threshold limit ,",
    "dimensionless luminosity scales as @xmath149 , owing to the asymptotic @xmath321 scaling of the unmodified nfw density distribution at large radius ( see   [ emodlum ] ) .",
    "when luminosity scales with the entropy threshold in this way , the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation should not flatten below @xmath322 , where line cooling dominates free - free emission , and the relation should also evolve little with time . the observed @xmath6-@xmath7 relation shares both of these features .",
    "furthermore , this scaling of luminosity with the entropy threshold leads to an @xmath6-@xmath7 relation slightly steeper than @xmath323 , with the extra steepening coming from the tendency for low - temperature halos to be more concentrated , also in agreement with observations .    adopting relations between halo concentration @xmath42 and halo mass @xmath184 that are drawn from simulations and supported by observations enables us to generate models for real clusters that reproduce many of their observable properties :    * fitting @xmath125-models to our modified - entropy clusters yields @xmath125 and core - radius values that are similar to those of observed clusters .",

    "correcting for cooling - flow emission leads to a very similar displacement in @xmath6-@xmath7 space , suggesting that the @xmath6-@xmath7 relation for uncorrected clusters may depend almost entirely on the two parameters @xmath184 and @xmath120 .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether values of @xmath120 derived from displacement in @xmath6-@xmath7 space agree with those implied by the inner temperature gradient .",
    "the modified - entropy models we have derived can account for many of the observed properties of present - day clusters , but they are obviously too simplistic to tell us how those clusters got to be the way they are . somehow , hierarchical structure formation generated intracluster entropy distributions similar to our simple prescriptions for entropy modification .",
    "cooling , feedback , and merging all have important roles to play .",
    "the consistency of our models with the data strongly suggests that radiative cooling sets the level of the intracluster entropy threshold and substantially reduces the amount of heat input needed to explain the observed scaling relations .",
    "however , radiative cooling unchecked by feedback would lead to overcooling of intrahalo gas at @xmath332 ( see   [ overcool ] ) .",
    "at least some feedback is needed to keep @xmath276% of intergalactic baryons in gaseous form , as observed .",
    "mergers following an episode of feedback can potentially amplify the entropy generated by that feedback , when low - density gas associated with low - temperature halos is shocked .",
    "however , the overall impact of mergers on intracluster entropy remains unclear .",
    "determining just how cooling , mergers , and feedback conspire to produce the present - day entropy distribution of clusters will require high - resolution numerical simulations and semi - analytical modeling focusing on the intergalactic entropy distribution and how it evolves .",

    "<S> we present a set of cluster models that link the present - day properties of clusters to the processes that govern galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> these models treat the entropy distribution of the intracluster medium as its most fundamental property . because convection strives to establish an entropy gradient that rises with radius , the observable properties of a relaxed cluster depend entirely on its dark - matter potential and the entropy distribution of its uncondensed gas . </S>",
    "<S> guided by simulations , we compute the intracluster entropy distribution that arises in the absence of radiative cooling and supernova heating by assuming that the gas - density distribution would be identical to that of the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - entropy gas would then fall below a critical entropy threshold at which the cooling time equals a hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> radiative cooling and whatever feedback is associated with it must modify the entropy of that low - entropy gas , changing the overall entropy distribution function and thereby altering the observable properties of the cluster . using some phenomenological prescriptions for entropy modification based on the existence of this cooling threshold , we construct a remarkably realistic set of cluster models . </S>",
    "<S> the surface - brightness profiles , mass - temperature relation , and luminosity - temperature relation of observed clusters all naturally emerge from these models . by introducing a single adjustable parameter related to the amount of intracluster gas that can cool within a hubble time </S>",
    "<S> , we can also reproduce the observed temperature gradients of clusters and the deviations of cooling - flow clusters from the standard luminosity - temperature relation . </S>"
