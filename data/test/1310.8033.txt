    "starburst galaxies are defined as galaxies that are currently undergoing a period of intense star - formation , mainly within ( but not exclusive to ) the nuclear region , at a rate that can not be maintained over their lifetime @xcite . the radio emission from such galaxies",
    "is not dominated by an active supermassive black hole , but by thermal and non - thermal emission that traces the star - forming activity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the thermal emission is the result of free - free ( or thermal bremsstrahlung ) radiation from gas ionised by hot , young stars , while the non - thermal emission is from synchrotron radiation due to the acceleration of electrons to relativistic speeds by the core - collapse of massive stars to form type  ii or type  ibc supernovae @xcite .",
    "interaction of the supernova with the local circumstellar medium generates a hot , shocked region that produces a prompt emission typically observed as a radio supernova ( rsn ) @xcite . as the rsn expand into the surrounding interstellar medium , they evolve into supernova remnants ( snrs ) , forming shells that emit non - thermal synchrotron radiation that can be visible over many years @xcite .",
    "studies of snrs within nearby starbust galaxies can provide important information on the astrophysical processes occurring within these galaxies .",
    "obscuration by dust and gas limit observations at shorter wavelengths , while radio wavelengths are largely unaffected .",
    "in addition , high - resolution , wide - field radio interferometry offers an opportunity to detect and resolve individual snrs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such observations over multiple epochs allow monitoring of the evolution of existing snrs and the detection of new rsne and/or snrs , enabling the supernova and star formation history of the galaxy to be reconstructed .",
    "such studies have been successfully applied to nearby starburst galaxies such as : m82 @xcite ; arp  220 @xcite ; arp  299 @xcite ; ngc  4945 @xcite ; and ngc  253 @xcite .",
    "these studies have provided a wealth of information concerning rsne and the evolution of snrs , the star - formation and supernova rates of the host galaxies , and the interstellar medium of the starburst region .",
    "for example , almost three decades of observations have identified @xmath5100 compact sources in m82 @xcite , where most have been resolved into parsec - scale shell - like structures @xcite .",
    "in addition , these multi - epoch observations have been instrumental in measuring the expansion speeds of the resolved snrs ( 2,000 - 11,000  kms@xmath2 ) , and with giving a direct estimate of the supernova rate ( 0.09  yr@xmath2 ) in m82 . the discovery of new sources such as sn2008iz @xcite and the radio transient 43.78 + 59.3 @xcite would not have been possible without regular radio monitoring of m82 .",
    "in addition , by combining multi - wavelength , high resolution radio observations of 46 compact sources in m82 , @xcite were able to identify low - frequency spectral turnovers , due to free - free absorption by the surrounding ionized medium .",
    "as one of the nearest star - forming galaxies , ngc  253 has been extensively studied from gamma - rays to radio wavelengths .",
    "recently , as part of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) nearby galaxy survey treasury ( angst ) , @xcite estimated the distance to ngc  253 as 3.47  @xmath6  0.24  mpc , 3.46  @xmath6  0.07  mpc and 3.40  @xmath6  0.09  mpc .",
    "the weighted average of the @xcite distance estimates , 3.44  @xmath6  0.13  mpc , is used as the distance to ngc  253 in this paper .    the first high - resolution , wide - field radio interferometric observations of ngc  253 were made by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter th85 ) with the very large array ( vla ) at 15  ghz ( 2  cm ) . with a resolution of @xmath7 , th85 discovered nine compact sources ( designated th1 to th9 ) within the central nuclear region . following the results of th85 , ulvestad and antonucci conducted almost a decade of multi - frequency radio (",
    "1.8 , 5 , 8.3 , 15 and 23  ghz ) observations of the nuclear star - forming region of ngc  253 with the vla , that culminated in a series of papers @xcite ; they identified 64 individual compact sources , including the original nine from th85 .",
    "spectral index measurements were obtained for the 17 brightest sources between frequency pairs of 5/15 and 8.3/23 ghz .",
    "almost half of the 17 sources were identified with thermal hii regions while the remaining sources were taken to be associated with snrs .",
    "over the course of their survey , no new rsne or snrs appeared and the radio flux densities of the detected snrs were found to be stable ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ua97 ) .",
    "this led to an estimate for the upper limit on the supernova rate of 0.3  yr@xmath2 by ua97 .",
    "in an attempt to resolve the low frequency radio emission in the inner 300  pc , @xcite conducted the first wide - field vlbi observations of ngc  253 .",
    "the observations were carried out with the australian long baseline array ( lba ) at 1.4  ghz and matched the angular resolution of the ua97 23  ghz vla observations . while the observations detected only two sources ( th7 and th9 ) , @xcite showed that the radio emission at low frequencies is absorbed by ionized gas with a free - free optical depth range at 1  ghz of @xmath8  2.5 to @xmath9  8 .",
    "this result was consistent with observations between 0.33 - 1.5 ghz with the vla @xcite and radio - recombination line ( rrl ) modelling of the nuclear region of ngc  253 @xcite .",
    "motivated by these indicators of free - free absorption in ngc  253 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lt06 ) began a program to observe the nuclear region of this galaxy with the lba .",
    "their observations , conducted in 2004 at 2.3  ghz , were higher in sensitivity and resolution than @xcite and covered the region observed by ua97 .",
    "they identified six compact sources , which were also seen in the higher frequency observations with the vla ( ua97 ) .",
    "one of the sources , 5.48 - 43.3 was also resolved into a shell - like structure approximately 90  mas ( 1.7  pc ) in diameter . combining the lt06 data with the multi - wavelength radio data from ua97",
    ", the spectra of 20 compact sources in the nuclear region of ngc  253 were found to be consistent with the free - free absorption interpretation of @xcite .",
    "the results indicated that while the free - free optical depth is highest towards the supposed nucleus , it varies significantly ( @xmath10  1 to @xmath9  20 ) throughout the nuclear region , implying variations in the gas density .",
    "of the 20 sources , eight were found to have flat spectral indices , indicative of thermal h  ii regions , while the remaining sources were taken to be associated with snrs due to their steep spectral indices at high frequencies . with no new sources detected in ngc  253 over almost two decades",
    ", lt06 developed a monte - carlo method based on the work of @xcite , to estimate the upper limit on the supernova rate .",
    "their model took into consideration improved distance measurements , a median free - free opacity , and the sensitivity limits of six observations over a 17  yr period .",
    "a value of 2.4  yr@xmath2 was derived for the upper limit on the supernova rate .",
    "this high value suggests that there may be a large number of undetected rsne , with observations over that period only detecting the rare , bright events .",
    "detecting weaker or short - lived snrs would provide tighter constraints on the supernova rate .",

    "since it was necessary to interpolate the flux density of a variable calibrator to obtain a value for the 2008 epoch ( see  [ sec : calib ] ) it would not be surprising if there were an error on the flux density scale . given the covariance of the flux densities between 2006 and 2008 ( and possibly for the other epochs too ) this would appear to be the case .",

    "the integrated flux densities of the injected sources were measured with blobcat and plotted in  [ fig : uvmod ] ( left plot ) against the model flux densities .",
    "if the flux density decrease in the observed dataset were due to only source variability , the measured ( or recovered ) flux densities would be equal to the injected flux densities , represented by the dashed lines .",
    "the deviation of the uvmod flux densities from the dashed lines follows a similar trend to the observed flux densities ( right plot of  [ fig : uvmod ] ) .",
    "thus it is possible the flux density decrease results mainly from systematic effects such as deconvolution errors ( e.g. clean bias @xcite ) and high side - lobes .",
    "the effect of clean bias is known to produce a systematic underestimate of flux densities @xcite by redistributing flux density from sources to noise peaks in the image during deconvolution .",
    "the magnitude of the flux density redistributed is generally independent of flux density , and thus the fractional error is largest for weak sources .",
    "this effect may have a stronger effect in the 2008 image ( as compared to the 2004 image ) due to the presence of high side - lobes .",
    "the high side - lobes may have resulted from the combination of poor @xmath21-coverage and an increased sensitivity due to a higher bandwidth .",
    "the rms ] difference between the 2008 recovered flux densities and the model flux densities is 37@xmath22 , which is added in quadrature with the absolute flux density scaling and measurement errors for the 2008 epoch ( see  [ sec : flux ] ) and listed in  [ tab : lbafluxes ] .",
