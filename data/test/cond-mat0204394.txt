    "pulsed laser depostion ( pld ) is an increasingly used growth method which is particularly suited for the fabrication of multilayer thin films  @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism of this technique is that the target material is ablated by a pulsed laser and then deposited in pulses on a substrate so that many atoms arrive at the surface simultaneously .",
    "experimentally each pulse lasts for about a few nanoseconds , and the time between two pulses is of the order of seconds .",
    "pld differs significantly from ordinary molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , where atoms are deposited continuously .",
    "growth experiments show that the surfaces in both cases have different morphologies .",
    "in particular it was observed that in some cases pld leads to smoother surfaces than mbe  @xcite .",
    "however , as there are only few theoretical studies so far , the mechanism leading to smoother surfaces in pld is not yet understood so that it is impossible to predict the growth quality for various materials and growth parameters .",
    "therefore the aim of the present work is to improve our understanding of pld by investigating the growth morphology for different growth parameters in a simple model .    without going into experimental details",
    "it should be mentioned that the physical conditions for pld are far less well defined than for mbe .",
    "the particles deposited may be atoms , clusters or even droplets .",
    "they may arrive with energies ranging from @xmath0 ev to 1000 ev .",
    "if very energetic particles arrive at the surface their kinetic energy is converted into heat at the surface , changing locally the effective mobility of the particles for a short time . in the present work this transient mobility",
    "is neglected , i.e. , it is assumed that the particles arrive at the substrate surface with energies of about @xmath0 ev which are of the same order of magnitude as in the case of thermal deposition .",
    "recently narhe _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the island statistics in the coalescence regime for a pld process where tin droplets are deposited on a sapphire substrate  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the scaling differs significantly from mbe due to the large fraction of multiple droplet coalescence under pulsed vapor delivery . while these results are valid for high deposition energies , the present work investigates a different physical regime , namely pulsed deposition of individual atoms at low energies and the formation of islands in two dimensions .",
    "the model investigated in the present work is defined as a solid - on - solid growth process on a square lattice of @xmath1 sites with integer heights representing the configuration of the adsorbed layer .",
    "the particles are deposited in pulses with an intensity @xmath2 which is defined as the number of particles per unit area deposited per pulse .",
    "the duration of a pulse is assumed to be zero and the transient enhancement of the mobility of freshly deposited adatoms is neglected .",
    "the model is controlled by three parameters , namely , the intensity @xmath2 of the pulses , the diffusion constant @xmath3 , and the average flux density of incoming particles @xmath4 .",
    "one of these parameters can be fixed by choosing the time scale so that we can use @xmath2 and @xmath5 as independent parameters .",
    "the dynamic rules are defined as follows .",
    "( i ) in each pulse @xmath6 atoms are instantaneously deposited at random positions on the surface .",
    "( ii ) between two pulses a time interval @xmath7 elapses , in which adatoms diffuse on the surface with rate @xmath3 .",
    "if ehrlich - schwoebel barriers are present the rate at which particles hop down the edge of an island is reduced .",
    "( iii ) if two atoms at the same height occupy neighboring sites they stick together irreversibly , forming the nucleus of a new island or attaching to an already existing island . in our model",
    "the influence of edge diffusion is neglected so that islands grow in a fractal manner before they coalesce .",
    "we present results from kinetic monte carlo simulations on a lattice of @xmath8 sites .",
    "finite size effects are discussed in the appendix .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following section we first recall the properties of pld without ehrlich - schwoebel barriers and its crossover to mbe in the limit of very low intensities @xcite . in sec .",

    "and @xmath9 . the figure shows typical configurations after deposition of @xmath10 ml.,width=302 ]    if the intensity @xmath2 is very small pld behaves essentially in the same way as mbe .",
    "in fact , at the lowest possible intensity , where only one atom per pulse is deposited , mbe and pld are equivalent up to minor statistical differences resulting from finite size effects ( see appendix ) . using lattices of @xmath11 sites we therefore restrict our analysis to the range @xmath12 where these finite size effects are negligible .    at high intensities",
    "the growth morphology of pld differs significantly from mbe . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figmbepld ] , there are much more nucleations at an early stage , although the effective flux of incoming particles is the same in both cases .",
    "the two regimes are separated by a crossover at a certain intensity @xmath13 , where the number of deposited atoms per pulse is of the same order of magnitude as the average adatom density in the corresponding mbe process . obviously , if the pulse intensity is much higher than the mbe adatom density , the adatoms nucleate much faster forming many small islands .",
    "for this reason pld is expected to yield more homogeneous surfaces , which explains the technological interest in this method .",
    "let us now study the crossover from mbe to pld in more detail  @xcite . the adatom density in mbe averaged over space and time",
    "is known to scale as @xmath14  @xcite , where    @xmath15    thus the crossover takes place at the critical intensity @xmath16 a quantity which distinguishes the two different growth modes shown in fig .",

    "however , it has been observed experimentally that pld leads to better growth results than mbe in certain situations where ehrlich - schwoebel barriers are present  @xcite .",
    "the influence of es barriers on pld is twofold . on the one hand , for high intensities",
    "many adatoms are deposited on the same island , which should increase the influence of es barriers . on the other hand , in pld",
    "the islands are much smaller so that adatoms tend to leave an island very quickly , thereby reducing the influence of es barriers .",
    "therefore , the question arises whether the experimentally observed improved quality of layer - by - layer growth in pld can be related to a reduced influence of es barriers and whether it is possible to choose the parameters of the model in such a way that pld produces smoother surfaces than mbe .",
    "this question has been addressed previously by schinzer et al .",
    "they studied the special case where one intense pulse ( 0.23 ml ) is deposited at the beginning of each monolayer , while the remaining atoms are deposited with a continuous flux .",
    "the aim was to check an idea of rosenfeld _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , that it should improve the smoothness of the surface , if the islands are forced to be much smaller than the diffusion length of the atoms deposited after the pulse .",
    "surprisingly , schinzer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found that this is not the case in their simulation . on the contrary , in the presence of the pulse the surface became rougher .",
    "a key concept for describing the influence of es - barriers is the time it takes before the first nucleation in the second layer takes place .",
    "layer - by - layer growth requires that nucleations in the second layer do not start significantly before the first layer is completed  @xcite . in the case of mbe",
    "the study of the second - layer nucleation time turned out to be very useful in order to predict the growth mode for a given set of parameters  @xcite . in the following",
    "we demonstrate that this concept can be successfully applied to pld as well . to this end",

    "is estimated as the fraction of islands with area @xmath75 , where a second - layer nucleation happened for the first time , averaging over several runs .",

    "the time scales are separated as follows . because of the high es barrier the nucleation time of adatoms on top of islands is much smaller than their residence time , while for @xmath80",
    "the residence time is in turn much smaller than the time interval between two pulses .",

    "this means that during a single pulse at least two atoms have to be deposited on the same island .",
    "obviously , the probability of depositing @xmath85 atoms on an island with area @xmath75 during one pulse is given by a poisson distribution with average @xmath86 , @xmath87 hence the nucleation probability can be expressed as @xmath88 fig .",
    "[ figpnuc]a shows the numerical results for @xmath77 for @xmath9 and different es - barriers .",
    "as can be seen , for increasing es barrier the measured curves approach the predicted one , ( [ eq : pnuc ] ) , which is shown as a dashed line .",
    "the agreement is good for @xmath89 , where the nucleation time is much shorter than the residence time .",
    "however , the agreement is not convincing for island areas @xmath90 , where the discrete lattice spacing starts to play a role . moreover ,",
    "the upper curves deviate for @xmath91 due to coalescence of large islands .",
    "this explanation is supported by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ figpnuc]b , where two different intensities are compared .",
    "indeed , for the lower intensity @xmath92 , where coalescence starts at larger island sizes , the measured and the predicted curves agree much better .",

    "( [ eq : pnuc ] ) one obtains to leading order @xmath95 using the previous estimate @xmath96 the exponent is given by @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the second layer nucleation probability @xmath77 grows with increasing intensity , enhancing the villain instability .",
    "contrarily , mbe with infinite @xmath5 always shows perfect layer - by - layer growth , even for high but finite es - barriers .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the limit @xmath93 pld can not improve layer - by - layer growth . in order to apply this result to practical situations",
    ", one has to find the lower boundary for @xmath5 , below which the behavior is different .",
    "this question will be addressed now .          for perfect layer - by - layer growth",
    "the squared surface width @xmath98 is known to oscillate between zero for completed monolayers and @xmath99 for half monolayers  @xcite . without es barriers",
    "such oscillations can be seen in mbe as well as in pld . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_examples]a , they are most pronounced in mbe while in pld they become more and more damped as the intensity increases .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that in pld without es barriers the roughness always increases with increasing pulse intensity .",
    "[ fig : comp_examples]b shows the corresponding result for a very high ehrlich - schwoebel length @xmath83 .",
    "there are no oscillations since the surface roughens very quickly due to the villain instability  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the width is now maximal for mbe and _ decreases _ with increasing pulse intensity , i.e. , the trend is reversed .",
    "this reversal can even be observed visually by monitoring the interface at different intensities , as shown in fig  [ fignucdemo ] .",
    "let us now investigate this reversal in more detail .",
    "since the oscillations in pld are extremely weak or not present at all , a numerical measurement of the damping time ( such as in ref .",
    "@xcite for mbe ) is not feasible .",
    "instead we monitored the squared surface width after deposition of a two monolayers  a coverage which is also relevant for experimental applications  @xcite .",
    "although the choice of two monolayers is arbitrary and does not permit a rigorous quantitative analysis , this criterion is very simple and tells us for which parameters pld produces smoother surfaces than mbe .",
    "the roughness after deposition of two monolayers is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pldmbe ] . in agreement with previous results for mbe  @xcite ,",
    "all curves increase monotonously , i.e. , the roughness increases with increasing ehrlich - schwoebel barrier .",
    "however , the curves for mbe and pld cross each other .",
    "the typical es barrier , where this crossing takes place , varies roughly as @xmath100 .",
    "this observation is in agreement with our previous result that for @xmath38 surfaces grown by mbe are always smoother compared to pld .",
    "thus there is indeed a range of parameters where pld with a high intensity produces smoother surfaces than mbe , even if the atoms are deposited with thermal energy .",
    "the ehrlich - schwoebel barriers are unphysically large ( typical experimental values are @xmath101 ) .",
    "therefore we believe that nonthermal energy deposition effects are important for explaining the experimentally observed growth improvement in pld .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to address the question , what causes the crossing of the curves in fig .",

    "thus , the curves in fig .",

    ", the first pulse leads to the formation of many small islands .",
    "after the first pulse there are two temporal regimes of different roughening behavior . because of the villain instability effective uphill currents lead to a quick formation of large mounds . as new nucleations",

    "[ subcomparison ] .",
    "therefore , the number and the lateral size of the mounds is essentially determined by the initial configuration of small islands after the first pulse .",
    "this determines at least for transient times also the height of the mounds and therefore the roughness of the surface . in our simulation model",
    "we do not observe slope selection . in a more realistic case",
    "one would expect that the mounds grow until their edges reach a critical slope where the uphill current becomes zero .",
    "then the process enters a different temporal regime where the mounds compete with one another , leading to an effective coarsening process where the roughness increases only slowly .    by increasing the pulse intensity second layer nucleations",
    "become more likely so that the villain instability is accelerated .",
    "however , the typical roughness from where on the process enters the second temporal regime of slow coarsening depends mainly on the initial density of islands after the first pulse .",

    "_ decreases _ with increasing intensity .",

    "in the present paper we have studied a model for pulsed laser deposition with and without ehrlich - schwoebel barriers .",

    "this reversal can be explained by the influence of the initial nucleation density after the first pulse on the roughening due to the villain instability .",
    "however , we believe that this mechanism alone can not explain the experimentally observed improvement of layerwise growth in pld where the barriers are much lower . in order to describe this effect more accurately",

    "this indicates , that the very high intensity of the single pulse per monolayer was responsible for the roughness in the simulations of schinzer _ et al .",
    ".    however , schinzer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also discovered a way to _ improve _ mbe with pulsed deposition : if desorption can not be neglected , atoms will preferentially evaporate from the top terraces .",

    "the curves coincide but do not follow a power law because of lattice effects . only in the range @xmath17 the curves follow approximately the expected power law @xmath111 . finally , for @xmath112 the island distances of mbe and pld differ increasingly from each other .    in order to demonstrate that this discrepancy between pld and mbe is a finite size effect we determine the values of @xmath113 from where on the island distances in both models differ by a certain factor . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figfinitegamma ] these values increase algebraically with the system size as @xmath114 where the exponent @xmath115 is found to be close to @xmath116 .",
    "this power law behavior can be explained as follows . in both cases",
    "single atoms are deposited and the average time between two depositions @xmath117 is the same . however , in pld the deposition takes place in constant time intervals , whereas in mbe atoms are randomly deposited so that the time intervals between deposition events obey a poissonian distribution @xmath118 with the variance @xmath119 . if such a fluctuation leads to a @xmath120 which is smaller than the average time interval between two depositions , more nucleations will be produced . as the formation of nucleations is irreversible this enhancement is not compensated by fluctuations in opposite direction where @xmath120 is large .",
    "therefore , the influence of fluctuations increases the number of nucleations , leading to a smaller average island distance than in pld .",
    "however , this effect can only be seen if the fluctuations are strong enough , i.e. , they have to be at least of the same order as @xmath121 , which is the average diffusion time ( in ml ) before an adatom reaches the edge of an island or another adatom .",
    "since @xmath122 this argument leads to the scaling relation @xmath123 for @xmath124 the exponent is @xmath125 while for dla it is given by @xmath126 .",
    "this result is in fair agreement with the numerically determined exponents in fig .",

    "<S> we investigate the physical properties of a simple model for pld in which the transient mobility of adatoms and diffusion along edges is neglected . analyzing the crossover from mbe to pld , the scaling properties of the time - dependent nucleation density as well as the influence of ehrlich - schwoebel barriers we find that there is indeed a range of parameters where the surface quality in pld is better than in mbe . </S>",
