    "the dynamics of the magnetic domain wall ( dw ) driven by electric current - induced spin - transfer torque ( stt ) is under extensive both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite investigations in recent years .",
    "as known to all , in general the dw motion can be driven by an external magnetic field@xcite and/or spin - polarized electric current.@xcite for the magnetic field - driven case , although the well - known walker s theory@xcite is usually used to understand the phenomena of dw movement induced by magnetic field , the origin of this motion is beyond the scope of walker s theory .",
    "however , x. r. wang _",
    "et al_.@xcite recently found that the mechanism of dw propagation by external magnetic field in a nanowire can attribute to the energy dissipation that is owing to gilbert damping . on the other hand for the current - induced case ,",
    "when an electron passes through a magnetic dw , it will be scattered by the noncollinear magnetic structure , which results in the phenomenon of magnetoresistance ( mr).@xcite meanwhile , the conduction electron can also transfer the spin angular momentum to the local spin when it flows through the dw .",
    "so a spin - transfer torque will exert on the local magnetic moment and then the electric current can be used to manipulate the magnetic structure of dw .",
    "this phenomenon of stt including current - induced dw motion was first predicted and observed in the experiments by l. berger and coworkers.@xcite moreover , this exotic phenomenon will also have some potential applications such as magnetic random - access memories ( mrams),@xcite racetrack memories,@xcite spin transfer nano oscillators ( stnos)@xcite etc .",
    ", which have attracted a great deal of attention recently .    for a dw in the adiabatic approximation",
    ", the spin of the incident electrons can be consistently aligned with the local spin moments .",
    "the spatial derivative of this adiabatic spin current yields the adiabatic stt which is written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the local spin of dw and @xmath2 is coordinate in transport direction.@xcite here @xmath3 is parameter with unit [ m / s ] in proportion to current density . however , there are always some conduction electron spins that can not follow the local spin moments as the width of dw decreasing .",
    "the process that the spin of conduction electron relax toward the local spin moments will cause a nonadiabatic torque@xcite called the @xmath4 term , which is in the form of @xmath5 , where @xmath4 is the dimensionless parameter and @xmath6 is the unit vector of local spin moments .",
    "further , s. zhang and z. li@xcite have pointed out that the adiabatic stt only contributes the initial velocity of dw movement while the nonadiabatic term mentioned above determines the terminal velocity observed in experiments .    however , for the relative narrow dw a nonlocal oscillating torques have been predicted theoretically by several groups@xcite and its quantum origin is similar to the rkky oscillation.@xcite moreover , in general the ratio between the maximum of nonadiabatic and adiabatic stt , such as the coefficient @xmath4 mentioned above , represents the degree of nonadiabaticity which can determine the velocity of dw movement.@xcite so one of the purposes in this paper is to find out whether there is a nonlocal oscillating or localized torques in real ferromagnetic materials by calculating the stt of dw using the first - principles method .",
    "and the other purpose is to study the difference in magnitude of nonadiabatic stt among the traditional ferromagnetic dws ( fe , co and ni ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "m. thorwart and r. egger@xcite have derived a torque in form of the second - order spatial derivative of the local spin by a gradient expansion scheme .",
    "hence , it is tempted to introduce a higher - order of nonadiabatic stt such as @xmath7 into the current - induced dw dynamics.@xcite so in this paper we will figure out whether there is higher - order torque in dw for real ferromagnetic materials .",
    "in addition , the effect of such higher - order stt on the dw movement is also needed for better understanding of current - induced dw dynamics .    in this paper , we will study the current - induced stt of defect - free dw in ballistic limit by the first - principles electronic structure calculations.@xcite our results show that the nonadiabatic stt of fe dw has localized form while the out - of - plane stts of co and ni are typical nonlocal oscillating torques .",
    "the degree of nonadiabaticity is also much greater for fe dw and increases exponentially with decreasing the width of dw .",
    "in addition , the results also show that the distribution of our calculated nonadiabatic stt for fe dw can well describe by the third - order spatial derivative term as @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the dynamics of local spin in dw pushed by this third - order stt is simulated using landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation .",
    "the obtained time evolution of dw movement demonstrates that with the same amplitude of the nonadiabatic stt the velocity owing to the third - order stt will be reduced to about half of the wall speed induced by the first - order term .",
    "our calculation of stt for dw is based on the scattering wave function matching ( wfm ) method with tight - binding linear muffine - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) basis.@xcite for a typical nel or bloch dw , the left and right domains act as leads and the wall structure is regarded as the scattering region , which defines the completed scattering problem of layered system as shown in fig .",

    "[ f4 ] , one can see that with decreasing the dw width the nonadiabaticity will increase exponentially , which agree well with the calculation of free - electron stoner model.@xcite further , the nonadiabaticity for co and fe dws have the same growth rate with decreasing @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , one can also observe that the nonadiabaticity of fe dw is about one order larger than that of co and ni dws . in the meantime ,",
    "the value of nonadiabaticity for fe dw even can be reach at a very high value ( @xmath67 ) for the narrow width @xmath51[ml ] . in general",

    "[ f4 ] , one can see that this mistracking contributed stts for co and ni are too small to be measured in experiments with reasonable dw width .",

    "there is still small difference between the calculated and the third - order stt , where the calculated stt also has small oscillating form .",
    "it implied that the reason of our calculated stt in fe dw being well fitted by the third - order term maybe is due to the dephasing effect , where the oscillating stt can be canceled each other by summing the @xmath8 states at fermi surface .",

    "owing to the shape of dw is film - like , the out - of - plane component of local spin moments can produce the demagnetization field @xmath97 , which can produce a torque resisting the adiabatic in - plane stt .",

    "the dw movements driven by the nonadiabatic stt of the third- ( @xmath98 ) and first - order ( @xmath99 ) term are also shown in fig .",

    "so the precession around the relative larger demagnetization field will not only resist the adiabatic in - plane stt but also can push the dw moving backward that is in the opposite direction for the case of only adiabatic stt .",

    "<S> current - induced spin - transfer torques ( stts ) have been studied in fe , co and ni domain walls ( dws ) by the method based on the first - principles noncollinear calculations of scattering wave functions expanded in the tight - binding linearized muffin - tin orbital ( tb - lmto ) basis . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the out - of - plane component of nonadiabatic stt in fe dw has localized form , which is in contrast to the typical nonlocal oscillating nonadiabatic torques obtained in co and ni dws . meanwhile , the degree of nonadiabaticity in stt is also much greater for fe dw . </S>",
    "<S> further , our results demonstrate that compared to the well - known first - order nonadiabatic stt , the torque in the third - order spatial derivative of local spin can better describe the distribution of localized nonadiabatic stt in fe dw . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of local spin driven by this third - order torques in fe dw have been investigated by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results show that with the same amplitude of stts the dw velocity induced by this third - order term is about half of the wall speed for the case of the first - order nonadiabatic stt . </S>"
