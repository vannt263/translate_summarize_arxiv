    "in this paper we focus on the problem of recovering behavior - related micro choice information from aggregate data . in particular , we consider origin - destination data , casting this problem as an inference problem concerning the prediction of flows on networks @xcite .",
    "we recognize that this type of data comes from dynamic , adaptive behavior systems involving interdependent micro components which give rise to an instantaneous , feedback - adaptive , world : as a result , such systems are non - deterministic in nature , involve information and uncertainty and are driven toward a certain , optimal , stationary state ( see , for example , @xcite ) . as a basis for predicting agents choices , we cast this as a self - organized , equilibrium seeking system in the form of weighted and binary networks ; we make use of information theoretic entropy - based methods to solve the ill - posed stochastic inverse problem and recover estimates of the unknown binary parameters .",
    "to go beyond traditional reductionist modeling and mathematical anomalies , we use a new paradigm that is developing under the name of network science ( see , for example , @xcite and the references contained therein ) .",
    "there are several things that make this approach attractive for information recovery in economics and in other social sciences : for example , in the economic - behavioral sciences everything seems to depend on everything else and this fits right into the interconnectedness simultaneity of the nonlinear ( and dynamic ) network paradigm .",
    "another example is provided by microeconomic theory , where the network representation of markets arises quite naturally ( in fact , in many ways markets and binary networks are equivalent - see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in terms of a methodology , network problems are consistent with the information theoretic approach to information recovery ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we seek an expression for the probabilities that the origin and the destination nodes are connected along a specific pathway in the statistical ensemble of possible pathways , without explicitly sampling the configuration space . given information about the origin - destination network structure in the form of a matrix @xmath0 , the unknown pathway probabilities @xmath1 must be estimated from aggregate flow data that may be noisy in nature .",
    "the number of unknown pathway parameters of the protocol matrix @xmath0 is much larger than the number of measured aggregate origin - destination data points and , moreover , the components of the matrix @xmath0 can not be observed directly .",
    "this means that although the observed data are considered to be directly influenced by the values of model components , the observations only indirectly reflect the influence of the latter : as a result , the analyst must use indirect noisy observations to recover information on the unobserved vector of parameters . as a consequence , the relationship characterizing the effect of unobservable components on the observed data must be somehow inverted . this type of ill posed pure or stochastic inverse regularization problem can not be solved by traditional econometric information recovery methods .",
    "as we seek new ways to think about the causal adaptive behavior of complex and dynamic micro systems , we note that problems of this type may be re - formulated as problems of constrained entropy - maximization over the pathways . in other words ,",
    "causal entropy maximization can be adopted as the systems status - measure and optimization criterion ( following @xcite ) .",
    "the result provides an exact expression for the occurrence of the unknown probabilities over the ensemble of pathways and yields the preferred probability distribution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this permits us to recast a behavioral system in terms of path microstates where entropy reflects the number of ways a macrostate can evolve along a path of possible microstates : the more diverse the number of path microstates , the larger the causal path entropy .",
    "the result is a causal entropic force that captures self - organized equilibrium seeking behavior ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , _ causal entropy maximization is a link that leads us to believe that a behavioral system with a large number of individuals , interacting locally and in finite time , is in fact optimizing itself_. we would like to stress that the optimization tendency characterizing behavioral systems is what qualifies entropy - based inference methods as the most correct ones to model such systems .",
    "the rationale beyond this lies in the nature of their adaptive behavior : agents tend to adapt behavior in line with an optimizing principle ( as the maximization of the future , accessible paths diversity - also definable , more generally , as `` resources '' @xcite ) , whence the need for a robust estimation procedure making the best use of the available information while disergarding any other arbitrary assumption . on the contrary ,",
    "most behavioral economic - econometric models rest upon _ ad hoc _ assumptions which may lead to the identification and biased estimates of the unknown parameters , the underlying inference procedure and , in turn , the conclusions about the agents behavior ( see @xcite ) . in the sections ahead we analyse systems within this framework , that permits the interpretation of adaptive economic behavior in terms of entropic functions : as a basis for solving micro - behavioral information recovery problems , we suggest an information theoretic family of entropic functions ; to demonstrate applicability , we consider binary and weighted data sets and recover the optimum corresponding unknown probabilities .",
    "in developing a basis for the use of information theoretic ( it ) methods to infer origin - destination networks flows , we focus on a stochastic ill posed inverse problem and the corresponding regularization method it implies ( the pure , without - noise inverse problem is just a special case ) . in this context the cressie - read ( cr ) family of entropic functions @xcite provides a basis for linking the data and the unknown model parameters .",
    "this permits the researcher to exploit the statistical machinery of information theory to gain insights on the underlying adaptive behavior of a dynamic process from a system that may not be in equilibrium .",
    "this approach contrasts with the traditional approach to micro information recovery that rests on reductionist economic and econometric functional analysis and observational agent behavior data : however , precisely because of the nonlinear and ordinal nature of dynamic micro systems , the traditional approach is cumbersome in terms of identifying and expressing adaptive behavior .",
    "we start introducing the cr multi parametric convex family of entropic functional measures",
    "@xcite :    @xmath2 . \\label{eq.1}\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "[ eq.1 ] , @xmath3 is a parameter that indexes members of the cr family , @xmath4 s represent the subject probabilities and the @xmath5 s are interpreted as reference ( or prior ) probabilities ( the reason for indexing our coefficients with @xmath6 will be clarified in the following section ) .",
    "being probabilities , the usual properties of @xmath7,\\:\\forall\\:c$ ] , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are assumed to hold . as @xmath3 varies the resulting cr estimator that minimize the divergence between @xmath10 and @xmath11 exhibits a qualitatively different behavior that includes , as noteworthy examples , the kullback - leibler measure ( in the limit as @xmath12 as shannon entropy and in the limit as @xmath13 as the likelihood functional ) and , in a binary context , the logistic distribution - divergence ( see @xcite ) .    in other words ,",
    "the cr family of power divergences is a class of additive convex functions that encompasses a broad family of test statistics , in turn representing a broad family of functional relationships within a moments - based estimation context .",
    "in addition , the cr measure exhibits proper convexity in @xmath10 , for all values of @xmath3 and @xmath11 , and embodies characteristics such as additivity and invariance with respect to a monotonic transformation of the divergence measures . in the context of extremum metrics ,",
    "the cr family represents a flexible family of pseudo - distance measures from which to derive empirical probabilities .",
    "in what follows we consider the two values @xmath14 , corresponding respectively to the _ likelihood functional _ and the _ shannon functional_. in the limit as @xmath15    @xmath16    the kullback - leibler divergence between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is obtained . the particular case of a uniform prior , @xmath17 , allows us to recover the usual form of ( minus ) the _ shannon entropy _ of the @xmath10 distribution : @xmath18 . in the limit as @xmath19 provides the second functional of our list    @xmath20    the kullback - leibler divergence between @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "the particular case of uniform prior @xmath17 allows us to recover the usual form of ( minus ) the _ likelihood function _ of the @xmath10 distribution : @xmath21 .",
    "we stress that while the shannon functional has been already employed for the analysis of univariate and bivariate data sets , the likelihood functional case has not been explicitly worked out yet , thus representing the major contribution of this paper to the analysis of behavioral networks .    .",
    "the cr family allows one to determine the probability coefficients @xmath22 by making use of the available partial information , i.e. aggregate data on traffic volumes.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in the binary network area , an example may be useful . consider the problem of determining least - time , point - to - point traffic flows between sub - networks , when only aggregate origin - destinations volumes are known ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in many ways",
    "this is like a transportation network , with the emphasis on design and efficiency in routing the traffic flows ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , exactly as in an economic - behavioral network the efficiency of information flow is predicated on discovering , or designing , protocols that efficiently route information .",
    "the research question concerns the prediction of the volume of flows on the pathways , given a set of measures taken along them .",
    "if we indicate by @xmath23 the @xmath24-dimensional vector of observed fluxes and by @xmath25 the @xmath26-dimensional vector of intermediate measures , the `` activity '' of an origin - destination network can be summed up by writing    @xmath27    where @xmath0 is an @xmath28 rectangular matrix , encoding the information about connections .",
    "thus , our problem translates into estimating @xmath25 on the basis of the @xmath24 , available components of @xmath23 and the connection structure @xmath0 .",
    "the ill - posed nature of the problem is such that the inversion of eq .",
    "[ eq.1 ] is not feasible : the number of unknowns is greater than the number of known data , i.e. @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", one can resort to the information theoretic methodology for solving problems of inference on the basis of partial information ( see @xcite ) . in order to implement",
    ", the problem unknowns have to be interpretable as probabilities and estimated on the basis of some known distribution moments . in our case , this can be easily achieved by dividing both sides of [ eq.1 ] by @xmath30 :    @xmath31    where @xmath23 and @xmath0 are known , @xmath10 is unknown and @xmath8 .",
    "we have thus rewritten [ eq.1 ] in terms of _ fractions of fluxes _ distributed across the @xmath26 channels and interpret them as unknown probabilities .",
    "notice that this peculiar definition of probability coefficients induces a distribution on the set of pathways , that play the role of an _ ensemble _ and allows us to restate the problem of predicting the fluxes on origin - destination networks as a ( more ) general problem of statistical inference .",
    "we can now may make use of the cr family of entropic divergence measures and write the problem as the following constrained optimization problem :    @xmath32-\\sum_\\alpha\\theta_\\alpha\\left[\\sum_c p_ca_{\\alpha c}-r_\\alpha\\right ] \\label{eq.3a}\\ ] ]    in particular , since the functional @xmath33 is a divergence , the lagrangean function has to be minimized with respect to the vector of coefficients @xmath10 .",
    "this gives us the desired coefficients @xmath34 as functions of the lagrangean multipliers , @xmath35 .",
    "once found , the parametric probability coefficients must be substituted back into @xmath36 , in order to obtain a quantity which is a function of the unknowns solely : @xmath37 .",
    "the last step of our procedure prescribes the optimization of the function @xmath37 ( see the appendix , `` univariate data sets '' section , for the detailed calculations ) .",
    "a similar problem is faced whenever a whole matrix of probability coefficients ( and not a simple vector ) , @xmath38 , is considered .",
    "problems of this type can be formulated in much the same way , by writing the equation    @xmath39    thus mimicking [ eq.1 ] . as we will show , treating @xmath40 and @xmath41 as known vectors allows us to succesfully also tackle this second type of problem ( see the appendix , `` bivariate data sets '' section , for the detailed calculations ) .",
    "these are just the solutions to a standard problem when a function must be inferred from insufficient sample - data information .",
    "thus network inference and monitoring problems have a strong resemblance to an inverse problem in which key aspects of a system are not directly observable ( for details on the use of information theoretic entropic methods for this type of network information flow problems see also @xcite ) .",
    "to test the effectiveness of our method , in what follows we analyze two aggregate data sets ( for which origin - destination traffic volumes were collected ) , the first one concerning traffic on a local area network and the second one concerning consumers choices of complementary products .        [ [ bell - labs - data . ] ] bell labs data .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the first data set involves traffic volumes on a local area network at bell labs ( see @xcite ) whose routing matrix is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] .",
    "the network topology we consider here yields 7 observed aggregate traffic volumes and 16 origin - destination traffic volumes to be estimated .",
    "aggregate volumes were measured every five minutes , over one day , on the bell labs corporate network , resulting in a set of measurements of 287 time points .",
    "[ [ complementary - products . ] ] complementary products .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the second data set comes from an economic case - study and relates to consumers behavior in the purchase of eggs and bacon ( see @xcite ) . in particular",

    ", it was recorded whether or not the household purchased eggs , bacon or both : the matrix entries represent the number of times a given customer purchased bacon and eggs over the course of the 4 trips ( as reported in table [ table1 ] - see also @xcite ) .",
