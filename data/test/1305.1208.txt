    "there are various forms of bijection between an exploration ( or height ) process and a random binary tree .",

    "the result in the critical case was first established by le gall @xcite , and in the subcritical case by pitman and winkel @xcite , see also geiger and kersting @xcite , lambert @xcite , where the exploration processes are jump processes , while ours are continuous . for similar results in the case where the approximating process is in discrete time and",
    "the tree is not necessarily binary , see duquesne and le gall @xcite .",
    "we consider also the supercritical case , which is new .",
    "inspired by the work of delmas @xcite , we note that in the supercritical case , the random tree killed at time @xmath0 is in bijection with the exploration process reflected below @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , one can define a unique local time process , which describes the local times of all the reflected exploration processes , and has the same law as the supercritical galton  watson process .",
    "we next renormalize our galton  watson tree and height process , and take the weak limit , thus providing a new proof of delmas extension @xcite of the second ray  knight theorem .",
    "the classical version of this theorem establishes the identity in law between the local time of reflected brownian motion considered at the time when the local time at @xmath2 reaches @xmath3 , and at all levels , and a feller critical branching diffusion .",
    "the same result holds in the subcritical ( resp .",
    "supercritical ) case , brownian motion being replaced by brownian motion with drift ( in the supercritical case , reflection below an arbitrary level , as above , is needed ) .",
    "the exploration process in fact describes the genealogical tree ( in the sense of aldous @xcite ) of the population , whose total mass follows a feller sde .",
    "our proof by approximation makes this interpretation completely transparent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 1 is devoted to the description of the bijection between height curves and binary trees .",
    "section 2 presents the relation between laws of height processes and galton  watson trees , and the `` discrete ray knight theorem '' .",
    "section 3 presents the results of convergence of both the population process and the height process , in the limit of large populations .",

    "the right one is used to represent the fate of the first offspring and of her progeny .",
    "the left one is used to represent the fate of the ancestor and of the rest of her progeny , excluding the first offspring and her progeny .",
    "if there is no other local minimum of @xmath5 neither at the left , nor at the right of the first explored one , it means that there is no further birth : we draw a vertical line up to the unique local maximum , whose height is a death time . continuing until there is no further local minimum - maximum to explore , we define by this procedure a bijection @xmath23 from @xmath16 into @xmath18 ( see figure [ fig 1 ] )",
    ". repeating the same construction @xmath14 times , we extend @xmath23 as a bijection between @xmath15 and @xmath19 . note that describing the exploration process from a tree is obvious ( the horizontal distances between the vertical branches are arbitrary ) .",
