    "our sign convention is that if @xmath4 then the circles are traversed in the counterclockwise direction .    in general , a magnetic field on a riemannian manifold @xmath5 is a closed differential 2-form @xmath6 , and",

    "magnetic billiards have attracted a considerable attention : see @xcite ; see also @xcite for a survey of various aspects of billiard systems .    in this paper",
    "we interpret a magnetic flow as a geodesic flow of a finsler metric .",

    "we interpret magnetic billiards as finsler ones and describe the magnetic version of the string construction that recovers a billiard table by a caustic of the billiard map .",

    "finsler geometry describes the propagation of light in an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium .",
    "this means that the velocity of light depends on the point and the direction .",
    "there are two equivalent descriptions of this process corresponding to the lagrangian and the hamiltonian approaches in classical mechanics , and we will mostly use the former .",
    "the optical properties of a medium are described by a quadratically convex smooth hypersurface , called the indicatrix , in the tangent space at each point .",
    "the indicatrix consists of the velocity vectors of the propagation of light at a point in all directions .",
    "it plays the role of the unit sphere in riemannian geometry .",
    "we do not assume that the indicatrices are centrally symmetric .",
    "equivalently , a finsler metric on a manifold @xmath5 is determined by a smooth nonnegative fiber - wise convex lagrangian function @xmath12 on the tangent bundle @xmath13 , homogeneous of degree 1 in the velocity : @xmath14 the restriction of @xmath15 to a tangent space @xmath16 gives the finsler length of vectors in @xmath16 , and the indicatrix at @xmath17 is the unit level hypersurface of @xmath12 .",

    "a finsler geodesic is an extremal of the functional @xmath20 .",
    "the finsler geodesic flow is the flow in @xmath13 in which the foot point of a vector moves along the finsler geodesic tangent to it , so that the vector remains tangent to this geodesic and preserves its finsler length .",
    "the finsler geodesic flow is described by the euler - lagrange equation @xmath21    the dual , hamiltonian approach describes the propagation of light in terms of wave fronts and the finsler geodesic flow as a hamiltonian flow in the cotangent bundle @xmath22 .",

    "given a vector @xmath25 , the respective covector @xmath26 is defined by the conditions : @xmath27 this gives a diffeomorphism @xmath28 , called the legendre transform .",
    "in the same way as the field of indicatrices determines the lagrangian @xmath15 , the field of figuratrices determines a hamiltonian @xmath29 on @xmath22 .",
    "the hamiltonian vector field of the function @xmath29 is also called the finsler geodesic flow ; the legendre transform identifies the two flows .",

    "the finsler billiard system is defined in @xcite as follows .",
    "a point moves inside @xmath5 freely , according to the finsler geodesic flow , until it hits the boundary .",
