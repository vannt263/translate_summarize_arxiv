    "despite the tremendous effort that has led to the discovery of neutrino mass  @xcite the mechanism of neutrino mass generation will remain open for years to come ( a detailed analysis of the three ",
    "neutrino oscillation parameters can be found in  @xcite ) . the most popular mechanism to generate neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "although the seesaw fits naturally in so(10 ) unification models , we currently have no clear hints that uniquely point towards any unification scheme .",
    "therefore it may well be that neutrino masses arise from physics having nothing to do with unification , such as certain seesaw variants  @xcite , and models with radiative generation  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the specific case of low - energy supersymmetry with violation of r  parity , as the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "r  parity is defined as @xmath0 with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 denoting spin , baryon and lepton numbers , respectively  @xcite .    in these models",
    "r  parity can be broken either explicitly or spontaneously . in the first case we consider the bilinear r ",
    "parity violation ( * brpv * ) model , the simplest effective description of r - parity violation  @xcite .",
    "the model not only accounts for the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing  @xcite , but also makes predictions for the decay branching ratios of the lightest supersymmetric particle  @xcite from the current measurements of neutrino mixing angles  @xcite . in the second case r ",
    "parity violation takes place `` a la higgs '' , i.e. , spontaneously , due to non - zero sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vevs )  @xcite . in this case one of the neutral cp - odd scalars is identified with the majoron , @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast with the seesaw majoron , ours is characterized by a small scale ( tev - like ) and carries only one unit of lepton number . in previous studies",
    "@xcite it was noted that the spontaneously r  parity violation ( * srpv * ) model leads to the possibility of invisibly decaying higgs bosons , provided there is an 1 singlet superfield @xmath5 coupling to the electroweak doublet higgses , the same that appears in the * nmssm*. we have reanalyzed @xcite this issue taking into account the small masses indicated by current neutrino oscillation data  @xcite .",
    "we have shown explicitly that the invisible higgs boson decay eq .",
    "( [ eq : hjj ] ) , @xmath6 can be the most important mode of higgs boson decay .",
    "this is remarkable , given the smallness of neutrino masses required to fit current neutrino oscillation data .",
    "in 1980 , weinberg@xcite noticed that the dimension - five operator @xmath7 could induce neutrino masses :        the models that can lead to this type of operator can be classified in _",
    "seesaw models _ and _ radiative models _ , that we now briefly review .        in models with right handed neutrinos @xmath8 where @xmath9 . the seesaw ( type i )  @xcite formula is @xmath10 which corresponds to the following diagram :    -2 mm       in models with higgs triplets @xmath11 we obtain the type ii seesaw formula  @xcite @xmath12 which corresponds to the following diagram          in addition to the normal neutrinos @xmath13 , the inverse seesaw@xcite uses two sequential su(3 ) @xmath14 su(2 ) @xmath14 u(1 ) singlets @xmath15 , @xmath16 , corresponding to the following mass matrix @xmath17 where @xmath18 are yukawa couplings , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are su(3 ) @xmath14 su(2 ) @xmath14 u(1 ) invariant mass entries .",
    "the effective mass matrix is then @xmath21 the smallness of @xmath20 is natural , in thooft s sense .",
    "however , there is no dynamical understanding of this smallness .",
    "we proposed@xcite an alternative inverse seesaw consistent with a realistic unified 0 model . in this model",
    "the mass matrix reads @xmath22 by inserting @xmath23 , coming from the minimization conditions@xcite , the @xmath24 scale drops out , leading to @xmath25\\ ] ] the neutrino mass is suppressed by @xmath26 , irrespective of how low is the b - l breaking scale @xmath24 ( as low as few tev ) .",
    "this corresponds to the following diagram        this new seesaw is linear in the dirac yukawa couplings @xmath27 .",
    "the most important result is that a low @xmath28 scale can be achieved while preserving the gauge coupling unification as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "+    another important result is the calculation of the cp asymmetry needed for leptogenesis in a model that is a variant@xcite of the previous one .",

    "the most general superpotential that leads to spontaneous r - parity violation ( srpv ) is @xmath34 where the singlet superfields @xmath35 carry a conserved lepton number assigned as @xmath36 .",
    "therefore lepton number and r - parity are conserved at lagrangian level .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of r  parity is driven by nonzero vevs for the scalar neutrinos .",

    "the spontaneous breaking of r  parity also entails the spontaneous violation of total lepton number .",
    "this implies that the _ majoron _ @xmath42\\ ] ] remains massless , as it is the nambu - goldstone boson associated to the breaking of lepton number .",
    "the effective neutrino mass matrix can be cast into a very simple form @xmath43 this equation resembles very closely the result for the brpv model once the dominant 1-loop corrections are taken into account .",
    "the effective bilinear r  parity violating parameters are @xmath44",
