    "the pionic decay of @xmath0 hypernuclei has received attention in the past both from the experimental  @xcite@xcite and theoretical  @xcite@xcite points of view ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "it is well known that the mesonic decay is largely suppressed by pauli blocking , although the consideration of proper pion distorted waves  @xcite weakens the effect of the pauli blocking considerably . on the other hand ,",
    "it was also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the relevance of the use of a correct energy balance in the decay .",
    "two theoretical frameworks have been traditionally used to describe this process : polarization propagator method ( ppm )  @xcite , supplemented by quantum field theory functional techniques  @xcite , and the wave function method ( wfm )  @xcite@xcite . in the ppm",
    ", the calculation of the pionic widths is performed in nuclear matter and the results are translated to finite nuclei by means of the local density approximation ( lda ) . both methods",
    "ppm and wfm turn out to be related in a semiclassical limit  @xcite , being the wfm more reliable than the ppm+lda , since the mesonic decay channel is quite sensitive to the details of the shell structure of the hypernuclei , specially for light systems .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a simple woods - saxon ( ws ) shell model was employed , with a central potential of constant depth for several nuclei .",
    "this global potential did not include spin - orbit term and only the radius of the ws well depended on the specific nuclei ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the resulting binding energies of the shells were globally shifted , by hand , to reproduce the ground state masses of the involved nuclei . besides , the continuum contribution to the decay was estimated by discretizing the positive nucleon energy levels by means of an infinite barrier placed at distances of about 20 fm . despite all these crude approximations ,",
    "the model led to predictions for the mesonic decay widths of @xmath2 which were compatible , within errors , with the available experimental measurements at that time , for both @xmath6 and @xmath1 decay channels .",
    "furthermore , the model of ref .",
    "@xcite provided an overall description of medium and heavy hypernuclei mesonic decay , which is still nowadays accepted as one of the most reliable theoretical estimates  @xcite .    very recently",
    ", precise measurements of the @xmath1 mesonic decay of @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been obtained at kek , and an upper bound for @xmath4 has also been given  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to update the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , improving the nuclear structure description of the process , by using : i ) more realistic potentials for each one of the nuclei by fitting the parameters of a ws well , with spin - orbit forces , to the ground state and also to some of the discrete final state energies of the nuclei involved in the decay and ii ) a continuum shell model ( csm ) to describe the positive energy tail of the mesonic decay width .",
    "in this way we replace the discrete sum used in ref .",
    "@xcite by the appropriate integral over the continuum states .",
    "this correct treatment of the continuum contribution is important , since , as we shall see , for @xmath1-@xmath3 decay it amounts about 50% of the total measured mesonic width , in contrast to the case of the hypernuclei studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , for which the continuum contribution was much smaller .",
    "since , as mentioned above , the use of pion distorted waves turns out to be crucial  @xcite , @xcite , the improved treatment of the nuclear structure allows us to use the new and precise measurements performed at kek , as a further test of the quality of the pion - nucleus dynamics used in ref .",
    "@xcite and developed in the works of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "a deep and detailed knowledge of the pion dynamics inside of a nuclear medium has become a topic of renewed interest to explore possible partial chiral restoration in the medium  @xcite-@xcite .",

    "in contrast to most of the hypernuclei studied previously by using the wfm  @xcite@xcite , for the three hypernuclei considered here , the continuum contribution in some cases plays a crucial role . as a matter of example , for @xmath1 decay of @xmath3",
    ", it turns out that @xmath11 is of the same size as @xmath12 ( 0.020 vs 0.019 ) and essential to understand the experimental datum .",
    "this reinforces the need of updating the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the evaluation of the continuum contribution was a bit rough , since there was assumed that it was only a small fraction of the total . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the continuum contribution was estimated by discretizing the positive nucleon energy levels , by means of an infinite barrier placed at distances of about 20 fm . in table",
    "[ tab : tab2 ] we compare the csm of this work with the model of ref .",
    "@xcite . in both cases",
    "we use the same nucleon ws mean potential .",
    "both methods agree remarkably well and much better of what one might expect a priory . within the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the sizeable contribution of the continuum is due to the presence of a quasi - bound ( 1.27 mev ) state , @xmath149 and it has its counterpart in the size of the @xmath163 multipole in the csm .",
    "even more , the differential partial width @xmath164 presents a narrow peak ( resonance ) , which gives most of the contribution to the integrated partial width , located around 1.27 mev , as can be seen in fig  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "small changes in the ws proton mean potential can bind this shell , going then its important contribution to the discrete part , @xmath12 , but remaining the total width @xmath165 almost unchanged .",
    "for example , if one uses a spin - orbit force depth of @xmath166 mev instead of @xmath167 mev , the @xmath149 proton shell becomes bound ( @xmath1200.1 mev ) and the total width is 0.042 @xmath35 instead of the value of 0.039 @xmath35 quoted in table  [ tab : tab1 ] . in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the exact position of the barrier might influence energies , the number of shells , and contributions of each shell , but again the total contribution to @xmath11 remains rather constant , as long as the barrier is placed far enough .",
    ".continuum contributions to the pionic decay width , units of @xmath35 , calculated with the nq @xmath1-nucleus optical potential , as defined in the caption of table  [ tab : tab1 ] , and two different methods : the sum of multipoles of the type @xmath168 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : cont1 ] ) and the sum over positive energy discrete bound ( by the effect of an infinite barrier placed at 20 fm ) states  @xcite .",
    "only contributions to @xmath11 larger than @xmath169 are shown .",
    "results are for the @xmath1-decay of the @xmath170 hypernucleus . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have tested for the sensitivity of our results to the mean field nucleon ws parameters .",
    "thus , we have increased and decreased the spin - orbit depth @xmath110 by 10% and re - adjusted the depth of the central part of the nucleon potential , @xmath114 , to get the experimental ground states masses of the involved nuclei , it is to say @xmath114 is modified to reproduce again the energies given in table  [ tab : fermilevel ] , with the new values of the spin - orbit force .",
    "results turn out to be quite stable , changing at most by a 2% , except for the @xmath1- decay of @xmath171 , where the uncertainty can be as large as one part in fifteen .",
    "to finish , we show the continuum nucleon energy distributions for the first nucleon multipoles , which give the bulk of the total , ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] to  [ fig : fig4 ] ) and the contribution to @xmath12 of each of the unoccupied shells ( table  [ tab : discr ] ) for the @xmath1 and @xmath6 decay widths of @xmath172 , of @xmath173 and of @xmath171 .",
