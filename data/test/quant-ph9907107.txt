    "recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations have demonstrated that ( almost ) unipolar , high power electromagnetic field pulses are a useful new spectroscopic tool which is particularly well suited for investigating the dynamics of weakly bound rydberg electrons . in current experiments",
    "the duration @xmath0 of these half - cycle pulses ( hcps ) extends from the subpicosecond to the nanosecond regime .",
    "several features distinguish the interaction of rydberg electrons with this new type of electromagnetic radiation from the interaction with conventional laser light or microwave fields .",
    "first of all , and in contrast to the optical case , the hcp interacts with the rydberg electron at every point of its orbit .",
    "furthermore , due to its unipolar nature the influence of the hcp on the electron can often be described in relatively simple and intuitive terms , e.g. , with the help of the so - called sudden - impact approximation where the effect of the hcp is modeled as an instantaneous momentum change .",
    "finally , the energy transfer between an oscillating electromagnetic field and a rydberg electron is always governed by an approximate energy conservation whose energy uncertainty is typically small in comparison with the amount of energy transferred .",
    "as hcps are almost unipolar such an approximate energy conservation does not hold and arbitrary amounts of energies can be transferred to a charged particle from zero up to a maximum amount of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "these characteristic features give rise to interesting novel phenomena which have been explored in a number of recent investigations .",
    "so far these studies have concentrated on total and energy - resolved ionization probabilities @xcite .",
    "theoretical work in this context has focused on numerical approaches @xcite that often employ the sudden - impact approximation and on one - dimensional models @xcite which try to capture the most significant physical effects occuring along the direction of polarization of a linearly polarized hcp .    in this paper a multi - dimensional semiclassical description of excitation of a weakly bound rydberg electron by a half - cycle pulse is developed .",
    "it quantitatively connects the quantum evolution of the rydberg electron to its underlying classical dynamics .",
    "the presented theoretical treatment is nonperturbative and it is applicable to arbitrary spatial and temporal hcp shapes . in particular",
    ", the approach is not restricted to the sudden - impact approximation . within this theoretical framework",
    "measurable transition probabilities are represented as coherent sums of probability amplitudes which are associated with corresponding classical trajectories of the excited rydberg electron .",
    "this method is very accurate numerically especially for highly excited rydberg states with large principal quantum numbers and for hcps whose transferred energy is small in comparison with typical ground - state ionization energies .",
    "it is precisely this dynamical regime which usually causes severe numerical problems in fully quantum mechanical calculations due to the large spatial extension of rydberg states and the presence of the coulomb singularity close to the nucleus .",
    "on the basis of this theoretical treatment we demonstrate that angular distributions of ionization probabilities contain a wealth of information about the ionization dynamics of the rydberg electron which can not be obtained from energy - resolved ionization spectra alone . in the sudden - impact approximation , for example",
    ", in which the pulse duration of the exciting hcp is small in comparison with the classical kepler period of the rydberg electron energy- and angle - resolved ionization spectra are dominated by oscillatory structures and semiclassical catastrophes of the rainbow and glory type .",
    "these structures can be explained in a clear and intuitive way in terms of interferences between probability amplitudes of a few classical electronic trajectories .",
    "the study of the influence of finite pulse durations indicates that some parts of these oscillatory structures depend strongly on the duration of the exciting hcp . a main purpose of our subsequent discussion is thus the systematic exploration of these latter effects which can not be described appropriately by the sudden - impact approximation .",

    "it is discussed to which extent the results of sec.iii a can be applied to the study of angle- and energy - resolved ionization spectra from hcps of finite duration .",
    "it is natural to examine this problem within a semiclassical approach as the theoretical framework discussed in sec .",
    "ii can be applied equally well to both instantaneous and time - dependent pulses and its quantitative accuracy has been demonstrated in sec .",
    "iii a. thus the main task consists in studying the classical electronic dynamics . in a fully quantum - mechanical treatment",
    "the partial wave expansion of sec.ii b would no longer be applicable .",
    "one would have to turn to a numerical integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation which is significantly more complicated due to the coulomb singularity at the nucleus and due to the large spatial extension of highly excited rydberg states .    in the present context",
    "our main question is to which extent the essential results of the sudden - impact approximation can be recovered in experiments with finite - duration hcps .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to concentrate the study on short pulses with durations @xmath0 up to the order of , say , one tenth of the rydberg electron s orbit time @xmath178 .",
    "typically this corresponds to pulse lengths around 1 ps which can easily be produced in the laboratory . before discussing in detail an example that illustrates characteristic effects originating from finite - duration hcps",
    "let us briefly summarize the main results of our investigations :    \\(i ) the behavior of trajectories starting close to the nucleus is modified significantly even by very short pulses whereas the dynamics of orbits originating at a large distance from the core is changed only very gradually .",
    "this is of course due to the different initial velocities of the trajectories : far way from the nucleus the electron moves slowly and the pulse can still be considered as almost instantaneous . from figs.[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] it follows that the part of the spectrum with small final angles @xmath67 , where the ionization probability is concentrated and where forward glory and rainbow scattering can be observed , is related to trajectories with large initial distances from the nucleus .",
    "thus these essential regions of the spectrum can be expected to be relatively insensitive to effects of finite pulse durations . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of the spectrum at large final angles is determined by trajectories starting close to the core . in this region of the spectrum , where the ionization probability is relatively small , pulse duration effects are most prominent . in particular , in our examples we even find backward glory scattering to vanish .",
    "\\(ii ) the deviations of the spectrum from the sudden - impact approximation are mainly determined by the pulse duration whereas details of the pulse shape seem to be of less importance .",
    "we compared the classical dynamics and spectra resulting from two types of hcps the shapes of which were almost rectangular and a half - period sine wave , respectively .",
    "these choices should represent typical variations of realistic hcp shapes .",
    "the differences in the resulting spectra for these two pulse forms ( calculated for identical pulse durations and integrated field strengths ) were small in comparison to the deviations from the sudden - impact approximation ( see figs .  [",
    "fig4](c ) and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "\\(iii ) in the sudden - impact approximation there are classical trajectories for _ all _ values of final energies @xmath179 .",
    "with increasing pulse duration , however , we find that the range of accessible final energies becomes more and more reduced in accordance with the energy - time uncertainty principle mentioned in the introduction . in order to discuss effects of finite pulse duration in more detail we consider as an example the ionization spectrum for an hcp with an almost rectangular pulse shape given by @xmath180 $ ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 are determined so that the integrated field strength and the pulse duration fulfill @xmath151 and @xmath183 , respectively . again , for the calculation an initial hydrogenic energy eigenstate with @xmath141 and with principal quantum number @xmath123 was chosen .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows an analysis of the corresponding classical dynamics and of the resulting ionization spectrum for a final energy of @xmath152 ( compare to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) details the changes in the classical dynamics .",
    "three major modifications can be observed :    \\(i ) the final angles @xmath67 of trajectories with initially outgoing radial momentum do not cover the full range @xmath184 as in the sudden - impact approximation .",
    "instead , they are restricted to values @xmath185 with @xmath186 in the present case . here",
    ", this does not lead to major changes in the spectrum .",
    "this is because in the angular region where the deviations of this trajectory class from the sudden - impact case become significant the dominant contributions already originate from trajectory classes ( i ) and ( ii ) [ see figs.[fig3](b ) and [ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "however , due to the absence of trajectory class ( iii ) for @xmath187 the small short - period modulations of the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , which are visible for @xmath67 between @xmath188 and @xmath189 , are no longer present in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .",
    "\\(ii ) a new class of trajectories appears which has no counterpart in the sudden - impact approximation .",
    "these orbits have initially incoming radial momenta and originate from the half - plane @xmath173 .",
    "their final angles vary between @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the maximum final angle is not attained at @xmath192 but at a finite distance from the nucleus so that there is a rainbow effect connected with this class of trajectories [ cf .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "however , due to the low classical weight of these trajectories they show up in the spectrum most prominently in the form of small modulations in the vicinity of @xmath176 .",
    "\\(iii ) the initial positions of trajectories which start with incoming radial momenta from the half - plane @xmath193 are changed significantly .",
    "in addition , the final angle @xmath194 is reached only for initial positions with @xmath195 , so that backward glory scattering has disappeared .",
    "the changes in the ionization spectrum at large angles which are due to these effects represent the most significant influence of finite pulse durations .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) the resulting ionization spectrum ( full curve ) is compared to a spectrum which has been calculated for an hcp of identical integrated field strength and pulse duration but with shape @xmath196 ( dashed curve ) . the spectrum for the sudden - impact approximation is also shown ( dotted curve ) .",
    "as mentioned above , for these pulse durations the influence of the hcp shape is only secondary even for large final angles .",
    "however , as the pulse length is increased to values larger than ca .",
    "0.1 @xmath197 these influences eventually become more significant .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the results of an investigation similar to fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) for a final energy of @xmath198 ( @xmath199 mev ) which corresponds to region ( i ) of the sudden - impact approximation ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as in the previous case",
    ", it is found that the main features of the spectrum of the sudden - impact approximation are left almost unchanged .",
    "the classical dynamics change similarly to the previous example .",
    "in particular , the new trajectory class still exists , but in the rapidly oscillating part of the spectrum its contribution is almost undiscernible .",
    "a general semiclassical treatment of excitation of weakly bound rydberg electrons by intense hcps has been presented .",
    "thus a quantitative connection between observable transition probabilities and the underlying classical dynamics of the excited rydberg electron has been established .",
    "this approach is numerically accurate for high principal quantum numbers of the rydberg electron and in cases in which the energy transfer from the exciting hcp to the rydberg electron is small in comparison with typical ionization energies of low - lying states .",
    "the underlying classical dynamics of the rydberg electron yields a clear and natural explanation for the oscillatory structures which govern the resulting energy- and angle - resolved ionization spectra .",
    "these structures arise from interference between probability amplitudes associated with different ionizing trajectories .",
    "thereby two types of semiclassical catastrophes appear , namely glory scattering for electron emission in the forward and backward direction of the polarization of the hcp and a rainbow phenomenon .",
    "parts of these oscillatory structures depend strongly on the ratio between the pulse duration of the exciting hcp and the classical kepler period of the initially prepared rydberg state .",
    "the amplitude and phase information which is contained in the semiclassical probability amplitudes might be useful for the reconstruction of quantum states of rydberg electrons . a first indication of the usefulness of such an approach was given by the investigation of the spectra pertaining to radial wave packets .",
