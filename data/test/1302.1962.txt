    "the triple junction ( tj ) is a line where three grain boundaries ( gbs ) meet together .",
    "it is commonly believed that tjs greatly influence properties of nanocrystalline materials and can play a significant role during plastic deformation and diffusional creep .",
    "@xcite    the tjs are much less studied crystalline defects than gbs or dislocations are .",
    "experimental investigations of tjs are complicated by many factors , including their high mobility .",
    "@xcite experimental measurements indicate that zinc diffusion along tjs in al is three orders of magnitude faster than along gbs .",
    "@xcite tjs can also be the sites of preferred solute segregation .",
    "@xcite some theoretical models introduce the assumption of fast tj diffusion to explain the anomalous diffusion and deformation behavior of nanocrystalline materials .",
    "@xcite however , no reliable experimental information on self - diffusion along tjs is currently available to verify this assumption .    due to the recent progress in the development of interatomic potentials capturing basic properties of materials on the quantitative level ,",
    "@xcite atomistic simulations offer a means of predicting self - diffusion coefficients that would otherwise be very difficult to measure .",
    "for example , the gb self - diffusion coefficients in copper predicted by simulations were found to be in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "@xcite to the best of our knowledge , tj diffusion has never been studied by atomistic simulations .    as in experiments ,",
    "the tj motion at finite temperatures poses a major challenge to diffusion simulations . in a few studies published so far",
    ", the tj motion was prevented by creating high - symmetry configurations @xcite or restricting the simulations to the 0 k temperature .",
    "applying these restrictions , the atomic structure of the tjs at 0 k was carefully examined and their excess energy was estimated ; @xcite however , no diffusion coefficients were computed .",
    "tj motion by capillary forces at high temperatures has been studied by two - dimensional lennard - jones simulations .",
    "@xcite    in this work we apply three - dimensional molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with an embedded - atom potential to compute self - diffusion coefficients along a representative tj and to compare them with self - diffusion coefficient in the adjoining gbs .",
    "since self - diffusion is the only type of diffusion studied here , we will be referring to it for brevity as simply `` diffusion '' . in section [ sec : method ] we show how a tj with controlled grain misorientations can be created in the computer and how its motion can be constrained by boundary conditions .",
    "we also introduce our methodology for diffusion calculations .",
    "our results are presented in section [ sub : results ] , followed by their discussion and conclusions in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we chose copper as the model material , with atomic interactions described by the embedded - atom potential developed in ref .  .",
    "the same potential was used in the recent study of gb diffusion @xcite .",
    "the bulk melting point of cu predicted by this potential is @xmath2 k ( the experimental value is 1356 k ) .",
    "our procedure for constructing an equilibrium tj is illustrated in figure [ scem ] .",
    "first , a symmetrical tilt @xmath0 boundary was created with the tilt axis parallel to the common @xmath3 $ ] direction of both grains .",
    "the grain dimensions are @xmath4 @xmath5 , where the third number @xmath6 .",
    "the gb was terminated at a free surface perpendicular to the tilt axis .",
    "another @xmath7 @xmath5 grain with the orientation shown in fig .",
    "[ scem ] was placed on the surface , forming a non - equilibrium tj .",
    "the model was equilibrated by a 2 ns long md run at 1100 k with a periodic boundary condition parallel to the tj and fixed boundary conditions at the bottom and the sides of the block ( the top side is exposed to vacuum ) .",
    "the fixed layers , shown in fig .",
    "[ scem ] in gray , were 10 @xmath8 thick .",
    "further details of the md methodology will be discussed later .    during the md anneal ,",
    "the tj quickly ( within the first 0.1 ns ) moved down , causing migration of the two initially horizontal gbs until an equilibrium configuration was reached .",
    "the planes of the moving gbs changed in this process , but the grain misorientation remained the same .",
    "the new gb planes were symmetrical with respect to the @xmath1 gb by construction , but they did not align with any particular low - index crystal planes in the grains .",
    "these new boundaries will be referred to as general gbs ( ggbs ) .",
    "once equilibrated , the tj and the gbs did not move except for small thermal fluctuations .",
    "note that the @xmath1 gb is pinned by the fixed region at the bottom while the ggbs are pinned by the surface grooves formed in the corners between the third grain and the two initial grains .",
    "finally , a cylindrical region with the axis parallel to the tj was cut out of the tricrystal ( fig .",
    "[ scem](c ) ) .",
    "the atoms within a 10 @xmath8 thick outer shell of the cylinder were made fixed , whereas all atoms inside the shell were allowed to move during the subsequent md simulations .",
    "the fixed shell served to pin the gbs and prevent their migration .",
    "note that the cross - section of the shell is not perfectly circular : it contains the previously formed surface grooves and a portion of the bottom fixed layer from the original block .",
    "the boundary condition parallel to the tj remained periodic .",
    "this cylindrical block contained 81,137 atoms and had the length of 66 @xmath5 .",
    "it was used as the initial configurations for the diffusion calculations .",
    "the md simulations were performed in the @xmath9 ( canonical ) ensemble using a nose - hoover thermostat .",
    "the integration of the equations of motion employed the verlet algorithm with the integration time step of 2 fs .",
    "the simulations covered the temperature range from 700 k ( the lowest temperature of reliable diffusion calculations accessible with our computational resources ) to 1315 k ( 12 k below @xmath10 ) . prior to an md run ,",
    "the block was uniformly expanded / contracted according to the thermal expansion factor at the intended simulation temperature , using the thermal expansion factors computed in ref .  .",
    "the model was then additionally equilibrated by a 1 ns long md run to approach the equilibrium point defect concentrations at the chosen temperature , followed by a 10 ns long production run for diffusion calculations . as a test of equilibration",
    ", the total energy of the simulation block was averaged over several time intervals covering the production stage , and it was checked that these average values followed a normal distribution .",
    "similar tests were made for the pressure inside the block .",
    "an additional proof of sufficient relaxation comes from the observations that ( i ) during the subsequent diffusion runs ( see below ) , the tj displacements were random and very small ( < 5 @xmath5 ) , and ( ii ) the mean - squared atomic displacements accurately followed the einstein relation . snapshots containing the atomic coordinates were saved every 0.02 ns and later post - processed to compute the diffusion coefficients .",
    "the diffusion coefficients @xmath11 were calculated from the linear fits of @xmath12 versus @xmath13 plots using the einstein relation @xmath14 . here , @xmath13 is the diffusion time and @xmath15 is the mean - squared displacement of atoms over the time @xmath13 in the @xmath16 direction parallel to the tj .",
    "since the atoms are labeled , @xmath15 was computed by comparing the initial and final coordinates of all atoms initially contained within a selected probe region and averaging their squared displacements in @xmath16 over the time interval between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this obtained value of @xmath12 was additionally averaged over all choices of the reference time @xmath17 by increasing it from zero to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the duration of the entire md run ( 10 ns ) .",
    "the maximum diffusion time @xmath13 was chosen to be 1 to 2 ns , depending on the temperature .",
    "the probe regions selected for gb diffusion were parallelepipeds aligned with the gb planes ( fig .",
    "[ scem_reg ] ) , which had the dimensions @xmath21 , where @xmath22 @xmath8 is the cylinder length .",
    "the width @xmath23 @xmath8 parallel to the gb was chosen so that to include as large a gb area as possible but avoid the influence of the tj and the fixed regions . since our goal was to evaluate the diffusivity in the gb core area , the half - thickness of the probe region was @xmath24 @xmath8 , which is close to the typical diffusion width of gbs .",
    "@xcite    for tj diffusion , the probe region was a cylinder with the radius of @xmath25 placed at the diffusion center of the tj ( fig .",
    "[ scem_reg ] ) .",
    "special care was taken to keep track of the position of the center . to achieve this ,",
    "a testing md run was made prior to the production run at each temperature and a group of atoms with the largest magnitude of displacements in @xmath16 was identified .",
    "such `` fastest '' atoms were invariably found in the tj region , which was already a qualitative proof of its enhanced diffusivity .",
    "the average coordinates of the `` fastest '' atoms were used to select the diffusion center of the tj .",
    "furthermore , the position of the center was recomputed for each snapshot during the production simulations and it was found to change only by small amounts that did not exceed @xmath25 .",
    "this confirmed the hight stability of our tj geometry .",
    "however , the position of the center had to be slightly re - adjusted for each temperature since changes in the contact angles of the gbs could produce tj displacements .",
    "diffusion coefficients in liquid copper were computed separately from mean - squared displacements of atoms at several temperatures using a large periodic supercell at zero pressure .",
    "the tj and gb structures were examined after `` quenching '' from 700 k to 0 k. although the structures contained a number of quenched - in point defects , the were very coherent and had thicknesses on the order of 2 - 3 interatomic distances .",
    "these structures remained quite coherent also at finite , but not too high , temperatures . from the dihedral angle of the gbs",
    ", the 0 k energy of the ggb is estimated to be approximately 0.9 of the @xmath1 gb energy .",
    "this number is very reasonable , given that the @xmath0 gb has the highest energy among all boundaries studied in refs .   and is roughly 10% above the energies of typical high - angle gbs .",
    "examination of the md snapshots reveals that the gbs and the tj become increasingly disordered with temperature , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ tj_struct ] .",
    "( the visualization employs the coordination - number mode of the atomeye program , @xcite plotting only atoms whose coordination number is smaller than a certain number . ) near the bulk melting point the gbs become increasingly wider , especially in the tj region , and develop a liquid - like structure . at 1315 k",
    "the tj essentially turns into a liquid pipe .",
    "typical @xmath15 versus time plots are displayed in fig .",
    "( [ msqd ] ) .",
    "their linearity demonstrates that the einstein relation is followed accurately , confirming that we have properly sampled the diffusion regime .",
    "the slopes of the curves indicate that the tj diffusion is faster than diffusion in the @xmath1 gb , and that both diffusivities increase with temperature .",
    "all diffusion coefficients obtained in this work are summarized in the arrhenius diagram in fig .",
    "[ arrh ] . observe the encouraging agreement with experimental data for self - diffusion in the bulk liquid @xcite and in high - purity polycrystalline cu , @xcite , by the gb diffusion width @xmath26 @xmath8 .",
    "] lending confidence to our simulation methodology .",
    "diffusion along the tj is seen to be faster than diffusion in both gbs at all temperatures tested .",
    "also , the @xmath0 gb shows a higher diffusivity than the ggb at all temperatures .",
    "the latter observation is consistent with the previous work @xcite , in which diffusion in the @xmath0 gb was found to be faster than in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 gbs .",
    "note the gb and tj diffusivities converge at high temperatures and tend the diffusivity of bulk liquid , which is in agreement with the premelting process . to put these data in perspective , the self - diffusion coefficient in the lattice computed with the same eam potential at the bulk melting point is as low as @xmath29 m@xmath30/s , which is beyond the scale of fig .",
    "[ arrh ] .    despite the significant scatter of the data points , the arrhenius plots in fig .",
    "[ arrh ] can be linearized except near the melting point .",
    "a fit according to the arrhenius equation @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the boltzmann factor ) in the temperature interval 700 - 1100 k gives the activation energies @xmath33 and pre - exponential factors @xmath34 summarized in table [ tab : arrhen ] .",
    "although these arrhenius parameters slightly depend on the choice of the temperature interval , their ordering remains the same .",
    "the activation energy of tj diffusion is always the smallest and close to that of the @xmath1 gb .",
    "we have proposed a computational method to create a single equilibrium tj with controlled crystallographic orientations of the grains .",
    "the geometric stability of the tj is ensured by the fixed boundary conditions which pin the gbs at three points .",
    "an alternative procedure could be to prepare three separate wedge - shaped grains with angles that sum to 180@xmath35and join them together like a cake . besides being much more tedious , this approach does not offer an easy way to eliminate the mismatch stresses that may arise due to possible changes in the translational states of the grains during the relaxation .",
    "in addition , the free volumes of the gbs and of the tj would have to be accommodated by elastic stresses .",
    "in contrast , in our method the tj forms _ naturally _ , as a result of gb migration at a high temperature ( fig .  [ scem](b ) ) .",
    "in this process , the equilibrium atomic density in the gbs and in the tj can be reached by atomic diffusion to / from the free surface .",
    "although in this paper we have implemented a particular set of grain misorientations , shown in fig .",
    "[ scem ] , other grain misorientations could have been created as well . a precise control the gb planes is more difficult , although some control is possible through judicious choices of the dimensions of the initial grains .",
    "the md simulations indicate that both the gbs and the tj become increasingly disordered at high temperatures and exhibit a premelting behavior near the bulk melting point ( fig .",
    "[ tj_struct ] ) .",
    "as the temperature approaches @xmath10 , the premelting first starts at the tj , then extends to the @xmath1 gb , and finally occurs at the ggbs .",
    "this sequence of premelting processes suggests that the tj has a higher excess free energy than the gbs studied here .",
    "the question of whether tjs carry an excess free energy relative to the adjoining gbs ( `` excess of excesses '' ) has long been debated in the literature .",
    "@xcite    diffusion simulations have been conducted over a wide temperature range and the diffusion coefficients in the tj and the gbs have been extracted from the mean - squared atomic displacements .",
    "it should be mentioned that due to the fixed boundary conditions and conserved number of atoms in the model , the point - defect equilibrium at the diffusion temperature could only be achieved by defect generation and/or absorption at the tj and the gbs . at high temperatures ,",
    "the tj and the boundaries were premelted or at least highly disordered , making them effective sinks and sources of point defects . even at the lowest temperature studied here ( 700 k ) , the tj region was still fairly disordered and was presumably able to generate and absorb point defects during the pre - diffusion anneal .",
    "this was evidenced by the linearity of the mean - square displacements versus time plots at this temperature , as well as by the independence of the diffusion results on the thermal history .",
    "for example , an additional low - temperature anneal of the tj prior to carving out the cylinder ( i.e. , when the gbs were still connected to the surface , fig .  [ scem](b ) ) did not change the diffusion coefficients within the statistical error .",
    "it is important to recognize , however , low - temperature md simulations in closed systems containing of well - ordered gbs or other extended defects can be associated with non - equilibrium point - defect concentrations and can give inaccurate diffusion coefficients .",
    "our calculations confirm that diffusion along the tj is faster than diffusion along the gbs at all temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ arrh ] ) .",
    "our results also suggest that , for diffusion along `` typical '' gbs , such as the ggb tested here , can be orders of magnitude slower than tj diffusion at low temperatures .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with recent experimental measurements .",
    "@xcite however , diffusion in the highly energetic @xmath0 gb is only a factor of two slower than in the tj .",
    "although this small gap tends to slightly increase at low temperatures , fig .",
    "[ arrh ] and the arrhenius parameters ( table [ tab : arrhen ] ) clearly indicate that high - diffusivity gbs such as @xmath1 can be more efficient for atomic transport in polycrystals than tjs .",
    "the factor of two higher diffusivity of tjs is hardly sufficient for making a significant contribution considering their much smaller cross - sectional area in comparison with gbs .",
    "as the temperature approaches the melting point , the tj and gb diffusivities converge to the bulk liquid diffusivity , reflecting the premelting process .",
    "a very similar behavior was recently observed for gb diffusion .",
    "@xcite the rapid increase of the diffusivity near @xmath10 produces a strong upward curvature of the arrhenius plots and the concept of activation energy loses its physical significance . from the convergence of the diffusivities at high temperatures",
    ", it appears unlikely that tjs can make a sensible contribution to diffusional creep at high temperatures , given their relatively small cross - sectional area even in nanocrystalline materials . with most gbs in nanocrystals being of general type , the contribution to the creep rates often attributed to tjs might be overestimated .",
