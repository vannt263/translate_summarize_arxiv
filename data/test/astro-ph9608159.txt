    "detailed simulations of galaxy encounters have become increasingly sophisticated during the last twenty - five years , due to significant improvement both in computer hardware and in algorithms used ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "most of these simulations attempt to explain features of specific encounters , often in an attempt to reproduce particular observations of interacting galaxies or merger remnants .",
    "in contrast , encounters between simpler galaxy models in order to obtain more general statistical results , have received less attention .",
    "the present paper attempts to address this latter problem , by limiting ourselves to simulations of equal - mass galaxy models of various types , in order to determine merger cross sections and reaction rates .",
    "our results can be readily applied to study the evolution of galaxy clusters , if we use our models to represent dark matter halos around galaxies in the limit that these halos can be considered to be spherical . in practice",
    ", moderate deviations from halo sphericity will not greatly affect our results .",
    "the merger probability in an encounter of two galaxies is enhanced significantly when the encounter takes place at relatively low speed . for a given cluster of galaxies , with a given population of specified galaxy halos ,",
    "the net merger rate can be determined by an integration of the usual @xmath3 factor ( density @xmath4 cross section @xmath4 velocity ) over a maxwellian or lowered maxwellian velocity distribution .",
    "this procedure is sketched qualitatively in fig .",
    "1b , and can be compared to that used in stellar evolution calculations ( fig .",
    "1a ) where nuclear reaction rates are determined from the encounters of individual nuclei in the cores of stars . in the latter case , cross sections rise quickly with increasing encounter speed , leaving a small window for effective encounters well into the high - energy tail of the maxwellian distribution .",
    "our case of galaxy mergers , in contrast , is dependent on low - speed encounters , and determined by a relatively small window at the low - energy end of the maxwellian distribution .",
    "1b suggests that we can make a good start by representing the velocity distribution of the galaxies in the cluster as having a constant density in velocity space ,  @xmath5 in three dimensions .",
    "this constant density can be obtained , for any given maxwellian distribution , as the density of galaxies around the peak of the folded merger occurrence @xmath6 in fig .",
    "2 we describe some technical details of our calculations . in ",
    "3 we present the cross sections , from which we determine reaction rates in  4 . in  5 , we determine the corrections to the reaction rates , due to tidal effects . as an application",
    ", we present the rate of galaxy merging in clusters of galaxies in  6 , and compare that with results from previous papers .  7 sums up .",
    "we choose our physical units of mass , length , and time by requiring that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass on a single galaxy , @xmath9 is the virial radius of a galaxy and @xmath10 is the gravitational constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "the virial radius is a measure of the size of a galaxy , defined so as to be able to express the potential energy of the galaxy to be equal to @xmath11 in practice , the virial radius is not very different from the half - mass radius @xmath12 . typically , @xmath13 with a coefficient generally in the range 0.76  0.98 ( @xcite ,  1.2a ) . in our standard case of a plummer model",
    "we have @xmath14 for the hernquist model @xmath15 and for a constant - density sphere @xmath16    the main reason to take the virial radius , rather than the more usual half - mass radius , as our choice of units is a physical one : when we vary the internal structure of our galaxies , it is more meaningful to keep the total energy @xmath17 of a galaxy constant than its half - mass radius . in our units , @xmath18    in terms of the particle positions ,",
    "the virial radius is the harmonic mean particle separation @xmath19 averaged over all particle pairs @xmath20 .      for the initial spherical galaxy model",
    ", we adopted five different choices : two plummer models with different cutoff radii @xmath21 ( 22.8 and 4 ) , two king models with different values for the central potential @xmath22 ( 1 and 7 ) , and a hernquist model ( @xcite ) with @xmath23 .",
    "we will indicate the plummer model with @xmath24 by ` truncated plummer ' and the plummer model with @xmath25 simply by ` plummer ' .",
    "these models provide a wide range of central condensation and halo distribution .",
    "they all have an isotropic velocity distribution since , according to aguilar and white ( 1985 ) , the difference in the velocity distribution is less important in determining merger cross sections than the difference in the density distribution . for all calculations ,",
    "initial galaxies are modeled by 2048 equal - mass particles ( except for several test calculations , see  3.4 ) .",
    "thus the total number of particles per run is 4096 . for plummer models and king models , we constructed random realizations using an algorithm similar to the one described in aarseth , henon and wielen ( 1974 ) . for hernquist models",
    ", we adopted a kind of `` quiet start '' , in which particle @xmath26 is initially placed in an arbitrary position on a sphere with a radius corresponding to the lagrangian mass @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity of each particle was then chosen randomly from the velocity distribution function at that radius .",
    "since the initial galaxy models are spherical , the relative orbit of the two given galaxies is determined by only two parameters specifying the incoming branch of the hyperbolic kepler orbit , the impact parameter @xmath28 and the relative velocity at infinity @xmath29 . in this study",
    ", we found it more convenient to specify the initial orbit by @xmath29 and the pericenter distance @xmath30 of the extrapolated unperturbed hyperbolic orbit , in the limit that two galaxies would have been point masses .",
    "the reason to use @xmath30 rather than @xmath28 is related to the measurements of energy change during relatively wide encounters : keeping @xmath30 constant allows us to let @xmath29 smoothly go to zero in the parabolic limit , where @xmath31 .",
    "2 shows the initial conditions used to determine the merging criterion for each models .",
    "the number of runs for one model is 60 - 140 .",
    "the following values for @xmath30 were used : 0 , 0.0125 , 0.05 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.6 , 1.8 , 2.0 , 2.4 , 2.8 , 3.2 , 3.6 , 4.0 , 4.8 , 5.6 , 6.4 , 8.0 . for the initial separation between the two approaching galaxies ,",
    "we choose a value of roughly @xmath32 , where @xmath12 is the half mass radius of each of the two identical galaxies .",
    "we have used a grape-3a ( @xcite ) , a special - purpose computer for collisionless @xmath33-body simulation , for all simulations .",
    "the grape-3a performs the calculation of the gravitational interaction between particles .",
    "it is used with a host computer which is a unix - based workstation .",
    "all calculations except for the force calculation are performed on the host computer .",
    "one grape-3a board hosts eight custom lsi chips , each of which calculates the gravitational interaction between particles in the speed of about 0.75 gflops .",
    "thus the peak speed of one board is 6 gflops . for most runs ,",
    "we have used two grape-3a boards in parallel .    for the force calculation , we have used a simple direct - summation algorithm .",
    "although it is perfectly possible to use the @xmath34 tree algorithm on the grape systems ( @xcite ) , it is not practical to do so for small particle numbers . the minimum number of particles for which the tree code is faster than the direct summation algorithm is @xmath35 , depending on the speed of the host computer . since we typically used only 4096 particles , direct summation was much faster than the tree code .",
    "we used the time - centered leap - frog integrator .",
    "the time step was 1/128 for all runs .",
    "the size of the softening parameter was @xmath36 .",
    "these parameters gave sufficient accuracy , resulting in a relative energy error well below 0.1 % at the end of each calculation ) .",
    "for each choice of galaxy model , and for each choice of pericenter distance @xmath30 , we have carried out a series of galaxy encounter simulations at different values for the encounter velocity @xmath29 ( measured at infinity ) .",
    "for each of these simulations , we determine the energy of the relative orbit of the two galaxies , well after the first encounter , using the simple energy criterion : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the masses of two galaxies , @xmath40 is the distance between two galaxies , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath41 is the reduced mass , @xmath29 is the relative velocity .    in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the energy @xmath42 as a function of time @xmath43 , for the case of hernquist model initial conditions , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is clear that the asymptotic value of the energy is reached soon after the encounter .",
    "however , to be on the safe side , we have extended all runs to reach a final separation comparable to the initial separation , where possible ( for a bound final state , we have taken the minimum of this separation and the apocenter of the elliptic orbit ) . in this particular example",
    ", it takes far more time to reach the initial separation again , because the outgoing orbit has far less positive energy and therefore the galaxies recede more slowly than they came in .",
    "having determined the asymptotic energy values @xmath46 , we select the pair of @xmath29 values between which the energy changes sign .",
    "we then use linear interpolation to determine the critical point @xmath47 at which the outgoing orbit would have been just parabolic , separating the regions of merging and escape . fig .",

    "we use @xmath53 , which gives a fairly accurate estimate for the potential for plummer models .",
    "we then make our initial guess as to which galaxy particle @xmath26 mostly likely might be bound , by assigning it to galaxy @xmath54 if @xmath55 , or to galaxy @xmath56 if @xmath57 .",

    "fig . 5 shows the critical velocity for merging @xmath58 as a function of the impact parameter @xmath28 , for all galaxy models used . the merging criterion determined",
    "experimentally here shows only a weak dependence on galaxy model : for the whole range of impact parameter studied , the difference in @xmath58 among the different models is less than 20% . for the plummer model",

    "5 . for the king model with @xmath60",
    "the index is slightly larger and for @xmath61 the index is slightly smaller .",
    "the slope for the hernquist model is somewhat more small .    at first sight , these results seem to be in good agreement with the distant tidal impulsive approximation , which indeed predicts a relationship @xmath59 for large @xmath28 .",
    "the tidal impulsive approximation has been used by many researchers to obtain analytic approximations for changes in mass and energy of galaxies involved in relatively weak encounters ( @xcite ) . in this approximation",
    ", the loss of energy of the relative orbital motion of the two galaxies scales as @xmath62 where @xmath30 and @xmath63 is the relative distance and relative velocity at closest approach . for the critical velocity ,",
    "the energy loss is equal to the kinetic energy of the orbital motion at the infinity : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the reduced mass .",
    "if we apply the point mass approximation for the relative orbit , the relations between the orbital elements are given by conservation of angular momentum and energy as @xmath66 here , we assume that @xmath67 . under this assumption ,",
    "the last equality is reduced to @xmath68 the resulting pericenter distance is then given as @xmath69 and the incoming velocity can now be expressed in terms of the impact parameter as @xmath70 seemingly in good agreement with the data shown in figure 6 .",
    "this good agreement is , however , fortuitous and does not reflect the physical reality .",
    "the discrepancies can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "6 , which shows the critical velocity @xmath71 as a function of pericenter distance @xmath30 .",
    "if the tidal approximation were really valid , the results for all models would show the same asymptotic behavior of  @xmath72 .",
    "the results for the plummer models and the concentrated king model is close to the theoretical line .",
    "however , the results for the hernquist model and the shallow king model deviate significantly .",
    "indeed , there was no reason to expect an impulsive tidal approximation to give us guidance in estimating the critical velocity for mergers to take place . as is clear from fig .",
    "6 , mergers at large @xmath30 take place for nearly parabolic orbits , where the duration of relatively close encounters around pericenter passage is drawn out to a total time exceeding that of the half - mass crossing time .",
    "there is no reason to expect , under these circumstances , that any type of impulsive approximation would be valid .",
    "why , then , did fig .",
    "5 show such a good correspondence with the line @xmath59 ?",
    "the reason can be found in a conspiracy of gravitational focusing effects together with the real merger criterion .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "suppose that we start with a relation for the energy loss in the form of a power law @xmath73 for the critical velocity at infinity , we then have @xmath74 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn3:5 ] ) , we obtain @xmath75 the slope of this relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 lies in the range @xmath76 , for _ any _ positive value of @xmath77 .",
    "this implies that even large differences in the relations between nearest approach and energy loss are not very well visible in fig .",
    "5 .    from a practical point of view",
    ", this reasoning has an interesting consequence : eq .",
    "( [ eqn3:9 ] ) implies that the merging cross section is relatively insensitive to the fact that the amount of energy loss varies widely among different models , when measured at the same pericenter distance .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", we already saw that the impulsive tidal approximation is not reasonable .",
    "more specifically , the time scale of the encounter is proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "if this encounter time scale significantly exceeds the orbital time scale of a particle in the galaxy , the binding energy of that particle becomes an adiabatic invariant . as a result",
    ", the energy change decays exponentially as a function of increasing @xmath30 .",
    "if a galaxy has a finite radius @xmath40 , encounters with @xmath79 will result in only a very small energy change , and @xmath80 would thus decrease exponentially",
    ".      a simple alternative to the impulsive approach could start with a determination of the amount of significant particle overlap during the encounter .",
    "a quick inspection of figs .",
    "5 and 6 already shows that this may be a reasonable approach , when we realize the exceptional nature of the hernquist and king ( @xmath60 ) models .",
    "these are the two models that deviate most in both figures , and indeed , these are the two models that deviate most in the position of the radius that encloses 95% of the mass in each model , with the king ( @xmath60 ) model having an unusually sharp cut - off and the the hernquist model having an unusually large amount of matter far from the core region ( see also fig .",
    "if a galaxy has an extended halo with a power - low density profile , the particles in the region outside the radius @xmath30 have orbital time scales comparable to , or longer than , the time scale of the encounter . as a result , those particles are strongly perturbed , and we can still expect the impulsive approximation to give a reasonable estimate , at least in order of magnitude .",
    "thus the energy gain of particles outside the radius @xmath30 can be estimated from the typical velocity kick @xmath81 they receive as @xmath82 \\left ( \\delta v \\right)^2 = [ m - m(r_p)]\\left({2gm \\over r_p v_p}\\right)^2\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the mass of a single galaxy enclosed inside the radius @xmath40 ( the total mass @xmath84 initially , in our units ) .",

    "this gives : @xmath86 m\\over r_p},\\ ] ] note that this energy change is equal to the binding energy of the mass outside the radius @xmath30 .",
    "in other words , in our approximation all particles are divided into two groups , an inner and an outer group .",
    "the inner particles are considered to be left undisturbed , while the outer ones are significantly perturbed during the encounter .    for galaxy models with a halo described by a power - low density @xmath87",
    ", we have @xmath88\\propto r^{-\\beta+3}$ ] and @xmath89 for the hernquist model , @xmath90 .",
    "therefore the power index in the latter relation is @xmath91 .",

    "( [ eqn3:11 ] ) . for both plummer and hernquist models ,",
    "the theoretical estimate and the numerical result show a reasonable agreement , well within a factor two for @xmath30 values in the range @xmath94 .",
    "this is a very satisfactory result , given the simple nature of our approximations .      from the @xmath95 results , plotted in figs . 4 and 5 , it is straightforward to determine the cross section @xmath96 for mergers to occur : @xmath97 the results are plotted in fig .",
    "a more useful way to display these cross section is by multiplying them with a factor @xmath98 .",
    "the first two factors of @xmath29 reflect the three - dimensional nature of a maxwellian velocity distribution , with a velocity space volume factor of @xmath99 ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn4:4 ] ) , while the third factor indicates the fact that , for a fixed target size , the rate of merging encounters is proportional to the relative velocity of the galaxies involved .",
    "the results , in the form of @xmath100 , are plotted in fig .",
    "9 . there is a slight gap at the left - hand side of the curves , where it would have been too time consuming to determine the critical merger velocities through numerical simulations .",
    "fortunately , we can use the arguments developed in  3.3 to extrapolate our numerical results leftwards of where the curves end . for galaxy models with a halo described by a power - low density @xmath87",
    ", we find from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn3:5 ] ) and ( [ eqn3:12 ] ) that @xmath101 this leads directly to @xmath102 for a hernquist model , with @xmath90 , we see that this quantity tends to a constant value for vanishing @xmath29 , while for a plummer model this quantity tends to scale as @xmath103 for low @xmath29 values . in the rate determinations of  4",
    ", we will use these analytic extrapolations to augment the numerical data .      in our simulations ,",
    "the total number of particles per galaxy has been typically @xmath104 .",
    "depending on the exact definition of half - mass relaxation time @xmath105 and half - mass crossing time @xmath106 , we can get somewhat different relationships between these two quantities .",
    "let us take as a reasonably accurate choice the expression @xmath107 ( see @xcite for the factor 0.4 ) . for @xmath104",
    ", this gives us @xmath108 .",
    "however , we have used a softening length of 1/32 . with a strong - deflection distance of order @xmath109 , the added softening increases the relaxation time by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "our galaxies can thus be expected to show significant relaxation after 60 half - mass crossing times . in our units ,",
    "the internal three - dimensional velocity dispersion of a galaxy is @xmath111 , and the time to cross the system , starting at the half - mass radius , is therefore @xmath112 .",
    "thus , we can expect significant relaxation to occur after @xmath113 time units .",
    "for the simulation in fig .",
    "3 , relaxation effects are not expected to be very important , given a total duration of the simulation of 100 time units . however",
    ", for larger impact parameters , the duration of a typical encounter simulation can be significantly longer , and relaxation effects may begin to influence the measurements of energy dissipation .",
    "this in turn will effect the determination of the border line for mergers to take place at high values for the impact parameter .",
    "we have run various tests in order to determine the systematic errors that can occur for large @xmath30 values .",
    "for example , for the king models with @xmath60 , we have rerun a number of experiments , using a total particle number per galaxy in the range @xmath114 , as compared to our standard value @xmath115 .",
    "for relatively small pericenter values , such as @xmath116 and @xmath117 , we did not find any noticeable change for the final merger boundary value @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , even downgrading our runs by a factor four in total particle number did not have a significant effect on the outcome .",
    "however , for @xmath119 , we found that the measured @xmath118 steadily decreased for increasing particle numbers , until leveling off for a value of @xmath33 four times larger than originally used .",
    "as a consequence , the reduction in slope in the lower right corner in the line labeled _ king ( @xmath60 ) _ in fig .",
    "6 is not correct . in the limit of @xmath120",
    ", the line will continue to descend with a near - constant slope , leading to @xmath71 values around @xmath121 that are roughly half of what we have obtained here for our standard value of @xmath115 particles per galaxy . however , these systematic errors do not contribute significantly to the overall reaction rates , as we can see in fig .",
    "given the cross section determined in the previous section , we are now in a position to determine the rate at which mergers occur , by averaging over a distribution of velocities .    the distribution function for the velocity of the galaxies inside a cluster is given in a maxwellian approximation by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion for the cluster .",
    "the distribution of encounter velocities is then given by @xmath124 where in both cases we use a normalization condition of unity after integration over velocities : @xmath125    let us introduce the ratio @xmath126 of the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the cluster and the one - dimensional internal velocity distribution of the stars in each galaxy : @xmath127 since @xmath128 in our units in which the specific kinetic energy @xmath129 .",
    "we thus have @xmath130    the number of merging events per unit time per unit volume is given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the number density of the galaxies and @xmath96 is the cross section of merging .",
    "we can also write this result as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the non - dimensional merging rate defined as @xmath135 where the upper limit of integration is reached at @xmath58 , since the cross section @xmath136 for @xmath137 .    note that in our units it is not immediately clear that this last expression is dimensionless .",
    "if we remind ourselves of the fact that our internal one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath138 and the virial radius of an individual galaxy @xmath139 , we can rewrite the expression for @xmath140 as @xmath141 from which it is clear that @xmath134 is dimensionless , since all physical factors ( density squared @xmath4 cross section @xmath4 velocity ) have been displayed here explicitly .    in rich clusters ,",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath142 in the cluster is several times larger than the internal velocity dispersion @xmath143 in each of the galaxies . even for less rich clusters , @xmath144 , typically .",
    "thus , for most rich clusters , the merging rate calculated with constant @xmath145 gives an error less than a few percent . for that regime ,",
    "the dimensionless merging rate is given by @xmath146    note that @xmath147 does not depend on the velocity distribution of galaxies within the cluster .",
    "the only dependency on the external velocity dispersion @xmath148 is through the factor @xmath149 in the expression for @xmath150 itself .",
    "this is simply the dilution factor in velocity space : increasing the external velocity dispersion decreases the density of galaxies within the region in which encounters can lead to merging .",
    "table 1 shows the nondimensional merging rate @xmath147 for all models . for non - zero values of @xmath126",
    ", we can approximate @xmath134 for most models by the following fitting formula @xmath151 while for the hernquist model a better approximation is given by the fitting formula @xmath152 the physical reason behind the fact that the hernquist model shows a merging rate that is 15% larger than the plummer model lies in the more extended mass distribution of the former , as is illustrated in fig . 12 .",
    "in our discussion of the merger cross section and the merger rate , we have so far regarded two galaxies as actually merging if the orbital binding energy of the two galaxies after the first encounter is negative .",
    "simple and straightforward as this assumption is , it may not be realistic in some extreme cases , as for example in rich clusters .",
    "in such cases , even if two galaxies have become formally bound after their first encounter , they may still be disrupted under the influence of either the tidal forces from the cluster as a whole , or the tidal forces from individual nearby galaxies . in the following ,",
    "we evaluate the magnitude and relevance of both of these effects .",
    "consider a cluster consisting of @xmath33 galaxies .",
    "the tidal force from the cluster would dissolve a pair of galaxy if the separation of the pair is larger than @xmath153 , where @xmath150 is the radius of the cluster and @xmath154 is the ratio of the total mass of the cluster to the mass associated with the individual galaxies .",
    "the coefficient in this expression would be @xmath155 in the limit in which the cluster mass is all concentrated in the center ( spitzer , 1987 , eq .",
    "5 - 5 ) . for more realistic mass distributions ,",
    "the tidal force on a typical merging pair is considerably less , and therefore @xmath156 is significantly larger .",
    "a reasonable approximation is therefore to simply take @xmath157 .",
    "thus , we discard a candidate merger pair if their first apocenter distance exceeds @xmath158      to determine the tidal effects of neighboring galaxies , acting as perturbers , requires a somewhat more complicated calculation . for",
    "a pair of galaxies in the process of merging to become unbound by the encounter with a third galaxy , this latter galaxy should pass within a distance that is sufficiently close , during a time that is sufficiently quick , _",
    "i.e. _ before the first fall - back",
    ". since most orbits after the first fly - by are highly eccentric , the fall - back time can be approximated by the orbital period itself , which is given for a pair of galaxies by @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the semi - major axis of the pair and @xmath161 is the mass of one galaxy .",
    "we can apply the usual @xmath3 argument for the rate , to determine a disruption criterion of the pair . for the pair to be disrupted , we have @xmath162 as an approximate formula . here",
    "we can estimate the density @xmath132 to be of order @xmath163 a typical relative velocity value is given by the virial theorem as @xmath164    we neglect gravitational focusing for the perturbers , which will fly by with a velocity much higher than the relative velocity of the two merger candidates around the apocenter of their first orbit .",
    "this means that we can use the geometrical cross section @xmath165 we can make a quantitative estimate for this cross section as follows .",
    "the average amount of energy transferred by a third galaxy which passes at a distance @xmath40 from one of the galaxies in the pair is given in the impulse approximation by @xmath166 this energy change must be larger than the binding energy of the pair @xmath167 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath168 as the maximum encounter distance to disrupt a pair .",
    "we can find a second expression for this distance , using equation [ eq : nsigmav ] .",
    "using both expressions to eliminate @xmath40 , substituting @xmath29 from equation ( [ eq : ourv ] ) , we find @xmath169 as the condition for disruption .",
    "taking into account that the first bound orbit , after the initial encounter , is likely to be highly eccentric , we can approximate the apocenter distance after the first encounter to be @xmath170 . the criterion for tidal disruption from a single nearby galaxy then becomes @xmath171 with @xmath172    comparing eqs .",
    "[ eq : aparent ] and [ eq : athird ] , we see that the latter critical distance exceeds the former by a factor @xmath173 since @xmath174 by definition .",
    "typical values for this ratio will be @xmath175 for rich clusters .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that the tidal forces exerted by neighboring galaxies are less important than the tidal force exerted by the parent cluster as a whole , in its effectiveness to disrupt a galaxy pair while it has become bound after its first encounter .",
    "how large is the critical distance @xmath176 for tidal disruption in real clusters ? for a cluster of @xmath33 galaxies , and using the notion introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x ] ) , we find that the half - mass radius of the cluster is larger than that of the individual galaxies by a factor of @xmath177 .",
    "thus , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : aparent ] ) we obtain @xmath178 for the maximum apocenter distance after the encounter at which tidal disruption can be avoided .    to sum up , tidal effects will disrupt those mergers that have a binding energy less than a critical value @xmath179 , given by @xmath180 where we have used equation [ somethingwith0.8 ] , with @xmath17 the internal energy of one galaxy ( @xmath181 in our units , see equation ( [ somethingwith0.25 ] ) ) .    for typical clusters",
    ", @xmath179 lies in the range @xmath182 .",
    "for example , for a cluster with @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 , we have @xmath186 , while for a rich cluster with @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 , we have @xmath190 .      in order to calculate the cross section as a function of critical binding energy for tidal disruption @xmath179 , we could perform a systematic search as we did for the case of @xmath191 . since this would require a rerun of many of our simulations , separately for each value of @xmath179 , it would be preferable to check whether an appropriate approximation exists that may allow us to derive a merging criterion for non - zero @xmath179 to a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the merging criterion is expressed as @xmath192 where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are the orbital binding energy of two galaxies before and after the first encounter , and @xmath195 is defined as @xmath196 .",
    "@xmath195 is a function of collision parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , or @xmath30 and @xmath63 , as described in section 3 .",
    "as an approximation , we try the assumption that @xmath195 is determined essentially by @xmath30 alone , at least when the relative velocity is close to the critical velocity for merging .",
    "thus , we have in first approximation : @xmath197 and therefore @xmath198 it is reasonable to expact this assumption to be quite good for most cases since @xmath63 is determined mainly by the potential energy at minimum separation , and depends only weakly on @xmath29 , the velocity at infinity .    to test whether this approximation is satisfactory , we compare the result of our numerical experiments and",
    "the theoretical estimate obtained assuming that @xmath195 is independent of the velocity at infinity .",
    "figure 13 shows the orbital energy of the relative motion of the two galaxies , in units of the kinetic energy associated with the critical velocity @xmath58 @xmath199 plotted against the initial orbital velocity at infinity , in units of the critical velocity .",
    "note that @xmath58 is calculated for the pericenter distance @xmath200 derived from the impact parameter @xmath28 through the two - body keplerian gravitational focusing approximation .",
    "the approximation of velocity - independent energy dissipation , given by equation ( [ detheory ] ) , is given here as the solid curve .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is excellent for a wide range of initial relative velocities .",
    "therefore , in the following we use the assumption that @xmath195 is a function of @xmath30 only .    figure 14 shows the effects of non - zero @xmath179 in terms on the differential merger rate @xmath201 .",
    "it is clear that the reduction in the merging probability is significant , especially for the hernquist model .",
    "the reduction is largest for lower velocities , for which a typical binding energy of the orbit after the first encounter is lower , and therefore the vulnerability to tidal effects larger .",
    "figure 15 gives the nondimensional merger rate @xmath202 as a function of @xmath179 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath203 on @xmath179 is similar for different models . for rich clusters with @xmath190 ,",
    "the merger rate is @xmath204 of the value for @xmath191 . for a more modest cluster , with @xmath205 ,",
    "the merger rate has dropped to @xmath206 of the value for @xmath191 .",
    "theoretically , @xmath150 should reach zero for some finite value of @xmath179 .",
    "thus , a fitting formula of the form @xmath207 would be an appropriate formula .",
    "we found @xmath208 and @xmath209 to give a reasonable fit for both a king model ( @xmath61 ) and a plummer model .",
    "as a straightforward application of the merger rates we have determined in the preceding sections , let us take a cluster of galaxies with a 3-d spatial density @xmath132 , and a 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath123 for the motion of the galaxies in the cluster .",
    "these galaxies are all considered to be given by identical hernquist models , with half - mass radius @xmath12 and internal 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath148 .",
    "we can use the asymptotic expression @xmath147 for the merger rate , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eqn4:9 ] ) and ( [ eqn4:11 ] ) , with the relation between the virial radius @xmath9 and the half mass radius @xmath12 given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn2:4 ] ) .    for a cluster of galaxies , with a one - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath142 km / s",
    ", we can express our main result in physical units as follows . under the assumption that all galaxies have identical halos , with internal one - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath143 km / s",
    ", we find a relative merger rate ( per unit volume of @xmath210 per gyr ) of @xmath211 where @xmath132 is the density of galaxies in the galaxy cluster .",
    "if we approximate the cluster by a collection of @xmath33 galaxies evenly distributed within a radius @xmath150 , we find a total merger rate of @xmath212 corresponding to a fiducial merger time scale of @xmath213 . in order for merging to occur at a rate that is significant over a hubble time",
    ", we would require a rate that is two orders of magnitudes larger .",
    "for example , we could take a cluster with 100 galaxies , within a radius of 1 mpc .",
    "if we keep the same fiducial values for the other parameters , given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn5:2 ] ) , mergers would occur at a rate of , on average , once every 50 myr .",
    "this merger rate is an overestimate , however , since we have not yet taken into account the disruptive effects of tidal interactions , discussed in the previous section .",
    "the corresponding correction factor , stemming from a finite @xmath179 , is fairly large .",
    "for example , for @xmath183 , @xmath188 and @xmath214 , the correction factor @xmath215 is around 0.25 .",
    "thus , we conclude that in the above case a merger occurs only once every 200 myr .    here",
    "we assumed that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium , which is certainly not true for clusters with , for example , substructures . to apply our result to such clusters , we need rather detailed knowledge about how the substructures evolve .",
    "we have presented cross sections (  3 ) and reaction rates (  4 ) for merging events to happen during encounters of equal - mass spherical galaxies , first in isolation , and then in the presence of a background cluster (  5 ) .",
    "our results are easily applied to estimate the merger rate in clusters of galaxies (  6 ) .    at first glance ,",
    "the restriction to spherical galaxies might seem somewhat restrictive .",
    "however , our numerical calculations as well as our very successful analytic approximations show that the merger rate is largely determined by the outer few - to - ten percent of the mass distribution in the galaxies . for realistic galaxies ,",
    "even with only a relatively small amount of dark matter , it is therefore the halo mass distribution that determines the merger rate .",
    "even if halos were significantly flattened , it would be rather surprising if our results would be affected by more than a factor of two . for practical purposes , therefore , we are confident that our results can be applied to galaxy clusters , directly as they are given in  6 .",
