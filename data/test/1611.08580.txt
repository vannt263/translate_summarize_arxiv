    "while the probability density function ( pdf ) of the sum of two independent random variables is easily described as the convolution of their pdfs , the expression for the pdf of the product is significantly more complicated . given two independent random variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 with pdfs @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the pdf @xmath6 of their product , @xmath7 , can be succinctly written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the delta function defined as @xmath10 for a class of test functions @xmath11.when written in a more traditional form , @xmath12 the difficulty of computing @xmath6 becomes apparent since the integral in diverges at @xmath13 as long as e.g. @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , in the simplest case when independent random variables are selected from two normal distributions with zero means , the pdf @xmath6 has a logarithmic singularity at @xmath13 ( see below ) .",
    "as far as we know , the only universal method currently available for computing the pdf of the product of two independent random variables relies on a monte - carlo approach , where one samples the individual pdfs , computes the products , and collects enough samples to achieve certain accuracy in the computation of @xmath6 in .",
    "however , due to the slow convergence of such method ( typically @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the number of samples ) achieving high accuracy is not feasible .    in this paper",
    "we show how to accurately and efficiently compute the pdf @xmath6 in using an approximate multiresolution analysis ( mra ) , where the scaling function is a gaussian .",
    "we demonstrate that , in contrast with the sampling method , our new algorithm is both fast and accurate .",
    "moreover , while the sampling method only provides a histogram of @xmath6 , we obtain the result in a functional form that can be used in further computations .",
    "a representation of a function in gaussian - based mra ( gmra ) can also be viewed as a multiresolution gaussian mixture .",
    "approximations by the gaussian mixtures have been used early on , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we prove that the integral ( [ eq : integral - to - compute-1 ] ) can be efficiently evaluated as a multiresolution gaussian mixture and provide a tight estimate for the accuracy of the result .",
    "our approach to constructing a gmra is based on the observation that , for any finite user - selected accuracy @xmath18 , the function @xmath19 satisfies an approximate two scale relation for an appropriately selected parameter @xmath20 . as a consequence , the scaled and shifted functions @xmath21 form a gaussian - based approximate mra .",
    "the approximate nature of the gmra does not limit its applicability since any finite accuracy can be selected .",
    "for example , in our computations we roughly match the double precision arithmetic of a typical computer by selecting @xmath18 in the range @xmath22 .    the integral ( [ eq : integral - to - compute-1 ] ) can , in principle , be computed using the mellin transform .",
    "it has been observed that , for non - negative random variables , the mellin transform of @xmath6 in ( [ eq : integral - to - compute-1 ] ) is equal to the product of the mellin transforms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( equivalently , @xmath6 is the so - called mellin convolution of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) . in e.g.  @xcite , this approach has been extended to random variables taking both positive and negative values .",
    "while analytically appealing , a numerical implementation of mellin convolution is problematic and has not resulted in a reliable numerical method .    instead of using the mellin",
    "transform to represent the pdfs of non - negative random variables , we can use linear combinations of decaying exponentials with complex exponents constructed via algorithms developed in @xcite .",
    "such representation of pdfs of non - negative random variables leads to a universal method for computing their product .",
    "we plan to address such approach in a separate paper .",
    "however , for random variables that can take both positive and negative values , it is more natural to use multiresolution gaussian mixtures as described in this paper . moreover , a generalization to higher dimensions becomes problematic if one were to split the treatment of positive and negative values of such random variables .",
    "computing the pdf of the product of independent random variables using gmra is just the first of several interesting applications of this approximate basis . the idea of using gaussians to approximate functions appeared earlier in @xcite , where the coefficients of the shifted gaussians were associated with function values .",
    "it turns out that much more accurate approximations can be achieved if the coefficients are computed differently , as described later in this paper . since",
    "many classical operators of mathematical physics can be accurately approximated via a linear combination of gaussians ( see e.g. @xcite ) , using gmra to apply these operators can be reduced to the analytic evaluation of integrals , and hence , suggests a new class of fast multiresolution algorithms .",
    "however , constructing such algorithms is not straightforward since integer translates of gaussians are far from being orthogonal ( after all , they are positive functions so that no cancellations are possible ) . therefore , the use of gmra differs from the usual mra with orthogonal or nearly orthogonal scaling functions and we briefly discuss some of these issues in the appendix .",
    "we present our basis construction for functions of one variable and note that the generalization to two and three variables is fairly straightforward and we will describe it in appropriate contexts . extending our approach to bases for multivariate functions in higher dimensions",
    "is more complicated and we plan to address it later .",
    "finally , we note that the quotient of two independent random variables can be evaluated in the same fashion as the product so that gmra allows us to develop a numerical calculus of pdfs .",
    "we start by proving a key approximation result and considering its consequences in section  [ sec : approximation - of - shifted ] . in section",
    "[ sec : distribution - of - the ] we prove a relative error estimate for the representation of the pdf of the product via gmra when one of the distributions is gaussian .",
    "we also present two approaches to approximating pdfs via a linear combination of gaussians .",
    "we then turn to numerical examples in section  [ sec : numerical - examples ] .",
    "conclusions and further work is discussed in section  [ sec : conclusions - and - further ] .",
    "finally , we present a brief discussion of certain features of gmra in the appendix .",
    "we start by proving a key estimate ( theorem  [ thm : projection of a gaussian ] below ) that allows us to replace any shifted gaussian by an explicit linear combination of gaussians ( with a larger , fixed exponent ) shifted at integer values .",
    "this estimate yields an approximate two - scale relation for gaussians that makes possible to construct an approximate multiresolution basis with gaussians as the scaling functions .",
    "since the basis of shifted gaussians is far from being orthogonal , one would expect difficulties in computing projections of functions on such basis .",
    "remarkably , theorem  [ thm : projection of a gaussian ] and theorem  [ thm : the - gaussian - on arbitrary scale ] allow us to compute such projections accurately for any gaussian with an arbitrary exponent and shift .",
    "since we are interested in applications where all functions and the results of computing integrals can be approximated via linear combinations of gaussians , the following result is the key to using gmra as a numerical tool .",

    "however , if @xmath49 , our approximation is substantially different and significantly more accurate than that obtained in @xcite .",
    "the key difference , of course , is in the approach to the selection of coefficients of the shifted gaussians .       while in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) we use the step size of the discretization to control the accuracy of approximating integrals by a sum , here we fix a unit step size and select the exponent of the gaussian @xmath42 in order to achieve the desired accuracy .",

    "a practical generalization to dimensions higher than three is more challenging and we plan to work towards it .",
    "computing the pdf of the product of independent random variables does not require all of the features of mra since we only compute projections on the scaling functions at appropriate scales .",
    "in this appendix we briefly present some of the usual mra constructs .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of orthogonal and bi - orthogonal wavelet bases , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we note that the approximate gmra is in many respects similar to mra based on high order splines , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , there are several special properties of gmra that are not shared by spline based mra .",
    "for example , as shown in theorem  [ thm : the - gaussian - on arbitrary scale ] , a gaussian with an arbitrary exponent and an arbitrary shift can be represented at an appropriate subspace which does not depend on the shift .",
    "another advantage of using gmra is that it becomes possible to apply operators to functions in a semi - analytic fashion which is important in a number of applications we plan to address separately .",

    "the second option is to accept a lower ( e.g. single precision ) accuracy in computations with gmra .",

    "an alternative approach motivated by the construction of gmra is to develop an exact mra such that the resulting scaling function is closely approximated by a single gaussian .",
