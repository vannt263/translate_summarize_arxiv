    "nowadays cross - kerr nonlinearity is considered as a promising tool for quantum computation and non - classical state generation @xcite .",
    "an entanglement arising between modes participating in the cross - kerr interaction can be used for establishing an interface between matter qubits and ` flying ' light photonic @xcite , for generation of non - gaussian states and schrdinger - cat states , and for performing quantum gate operations @xcite .",
    "an interest to cross - kerr nonlinear interactions is heated up by both developing ways to implement effectively even very weak non - linearities ( which one commonly expects to have in practice ) , and by discovery of methods to produce sufficiently large self - kerr and cross - kerr nonlinearities ( such as implementation of the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) and photonic crystals @xcite ) .",
    "decoherence is a main practical obstacle to implementations of schemes using kerr and cross - kerr nonlinearities .",
    "a genuine example of quantum state degradation due to losses is a decoherence of a quantum superposition state , the effect drastically enhanced if speaking of a macroscopic superposition state of the schrdinger cat type . already more than 20 years ago",
    "the self - kerr nonlinearity was proposed as a tool for generating such a schrdinger - cat state ( more precisely , a superposition of two coherent states with the same amplitudes but opposite phases ) @xcite . however , photon losses turn this superposition into statistical mixture of two coherent states with the rate proportional to the square modulus of the amplitude of these states",
    ". modifications of the scheme for the cross - kerr nonlinearities or four - wave mixing brought no advantage with respect to photon loss @xcite .",
    "this unfortunate circumstance made one look for the ways to circumvent the problem of decoherence that inevitably accompanies kerr nonlinearity .",
    "recent suggestions in this direction are based on the conditional preparation of desired states ( which brings into consideration an additional problem of the finite detection efficiency ) , and are aimed to exploit weak nonlinearities .",
    "recently , even a way to produce cat - states ` on demand ' was suggested using a source of single - photons @xcite .    in our work",
    "we want to discuss an aspect of the decoherence which has been seldom discussed when considering an influence of losses on states generated via kerr nonlinearity .",
    "namely , we address losses arising _ in the process _ of generation and not due to propagation of the generated state via lossy channels .",
    "we concentrate our attention on a feature that might be quite significantly pronounced in modern schemes of generating large kerr nonlinearity : the modal loss can be strongly correlated .",
    "indeed , the modes occupy the same volume and interact with the same physical systems which form the reservoirs .",
    "also , if the kerr - nonlinearity scheme implies a sufficiently strong dispersive coupling of light modes to emitters , then coupling of these emitters to dissipative reservoirs might also appear to be quite strong . as a result , this would mean strongly correlated modal losses .",
    "for example , in photonic crystals high density of states in the vicinity of a modal frequencies and emitter s transition frequency can cause the strong emitter - field coupling ; but it would also imply higher population loss of emitters due to coupling to radiative reservoirs . dephasing losses of emitters would as well invoke a correlated modal dephasing .",
    "coupling to correlated reservoirs can drastically change state dynamics in comparison with loss to uncorrelated reservoirs .",
    "for example , it was demonstrated that coupling to the common reservoir preserves entanglement of a two - mode state @xcite .",
    "moreover , coupling to the common reservoir is capable of creating an entanglement between states of initially unentangled modes even in absence of any direct interaction between them .    in our work",
    "we demonstrate both how the correlated loss arises via kerr nonlinear process , and how it affects the generated states . for this purpose",
    "we derive analytic solution generalizing a powerful and illustrative method of chaturvedi and srinivasan @xcite . on a number of examples",
    "we show how the correlated loss enhances and creates intermodal correlations and even entanglement , and might lead to generation of entangled states quite different from those generated in the same scheme without loss .",
    "correlated loss can result in the significantly enhanced robustness of the generation scheme .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii and in the related appendices we describe how cross - correlation terms emerge via correlations of markovian reservoirs ; we consider an example of the emitter - field interaction schemes producing correlated modal losses in the section iii . then in sec .",
    "iv we describe the method for obtaining exact solutions of the cross - kerr nonlinear interaction between modes in presence of losses to uncorrelated reservoirs and give generalization of the method for some cases of correlated losses . in the sec .",
    "v we analyze influence of losses in the nonclassical state generation process for the case of uncorrelated loss .",
    "some examples of correlated losses are considered in sec .",
    "to illustrate clearly an influence of correlated and uncorrelated losses , we restrict ourselves to the markovian loss accounting for photon losses and dephasing of interacting modes .",
    "we start from the general effective hamiltonian @xmath0 describing both self- and cross - interaction ( for the moment we refrain from detailing it ) and interaction of modes with reservoirs responsible for losses @xmath1 : @xmath2 here we use the interaction picture with respect to the free hamiltonians of reservoirs and the modes participating in the interaction process .",
    "these modes are described by usual bosonic creation and annihilation operators satisfying @xmath3=[a_2,a_2^{\\dagger}]=1 , \\quad [ a_1,a_2^{\\dagger}]=[a_1,a_2]=0.\\ ] ] the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe reservoirs responsible , correspondingly , to the photon losses in modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and to dephasing of these modes .",
    "they may include also stochastic variables describing different realizations of reservoirs .",
    "it should be emphasized that reservoir operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( together with the initial state of the reservoir ) completely describe the reservoir properties with respect to the interaction with the modes .",
    "these operators are built on the basis of underlying microscopic model and account for all relevant physical parameters .",
    "for example , if the photon loss reservoir of the first mode is composed of electromagnetic field modes with frequencies @xmath8 , described by the creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 , then @xmath10 where each @xmath11 is the constant of interaction of the mode @xmath6 with the @xmath12th mode of the reservoir .",
    "sets of frequencies @xmath8 and interaction constants @xmath11 describe completely physical properties of the reservoir . in particular , if the reservoir is the set of electromagnetic modes of a non - absorbing dielectric structure , they are found from the eigensolutions of maxwell s equations for this structure @xcite .",
    "we make a number of standard assumptions in considering decoherence : coupling with the reservoirs is weak , the initial state of the modes @xmath13 are uncorrelated with initial state of reservoirs , and correlation times of reservoirs are small enough to enable an implementation of the born - markov approximation .",
    "then , using , for example , a time - convolutionless projection operator technique @xcite , one can obtain the master equation , the liouville equation of the following form : @xmath14 + { 1\\over 2 } [ ( \\gamma_1-\\gamma_{12})\\mathcal{l}(a_1)+ ( \\gamma_2-\\gamma_{12})\\mathcal{l}(a_2)+ ( d_1-d_{12})\\mathcal{l}(a_1^{\\dagger}a_1)+(d_2-d_{12})\\mathcal{l}(a_2^{\\dagger}a_2)]\\rho(t)+\\\\ { 1\\over 2 } [ \\gamma_{12}\\mathcal{l}(a_1+a_2)+d_{12}\\mathcal{l}(a_1^{\\dagger}a_1+a_2^{\\dagger}a_2)]\\rho(t ) , \\label{master_markov}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superoperator @xmath15 acts on the density matrix as @xmath16 here we set @xmath17 for simplicity . for more details of the derivation see appendix a. by construction , the master equation ( [ master_markov ] ) provides for non - negative definite @xmath18 for arbitrary @xmath19 .",
    "note that we call reservoirs `` correlated '' , if their integrated cross - correlation function is non - zero , for example , @xmath20 and , correspondingly , the coefficient @xmath21 defined in eq .",
    "( [ gamma12 ] ) is non - zero . of course",
    ", one can always transform eq .",
    "( [ master_markov ] ) to the diagonal form .",
    "however , in this case lindblad operators ( i.e. operators like @xmath22 in the diagonal form ( [ diagonal form ] ) ) will be the linear superpositions of the former lindblad operators , and the transformed equation will be still describing a coupling between physical objects represented by these original lindblad operators ( modes @xmath23 in our case ) .",
    "for example , the possibility that both modes are coupled to the same reservoir ( either the photon loss reservoir or the dephasing one ) corresponds to an equality in relations ( [ rates_unequalities ] ) in appendix a. in this case the operators describing the reservoir are proportional to each other , say , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . equation ( [ master_markov ] ) then reduces to @xmath14 + { 1\\over 2 } [ \\gamma_{1}\\mathcal{l}(a_1+xa_2)+d_{1}\\mathcal{l}(a_1^{\\dagger}a_1+ya_2^{\\dagger}a_2)]\\rho(t ) .",
    "\\label{master_markov_corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the most important point here is that in this equation both modes behave like a single object with respect to relaxation .",
    "such a ` decoherence ' is able to induce enduring entanglement between modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( an example is shown in the appendix b ) .",
    "furthermore , interacting light modes might experience correlated losses due to fact that they both interact with the same atoms .",
    "one can illustrate the mechanism of such a loss by the following qualitative consideration .",
    "let us consider a general hamiltonian describing the light - atom interaction @xmath26 plus terms describing interaction of atoms with the dissipative reservoirs @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are operators describing the atoms and dissipative reservoirs , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian of this form describes a general interaction between field modes and emitters of some type as the correlated loss can occur in different physical systems .",
    "provided atom - reservoir interactions in ( [ ham - loss ] ) is sufficiently weak as not to perturb much interaction between light modes and atoms , the following approximation can be used for the atomic operators : @xmath30 where @xmath31 , and t denotes the time - ordering operator . after averaging out the atomic variable ,",
    "the terms that describe reservoir - mode coupling in the effective interaction hamiltonian will take the form of @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 denotes the averaging over atomic states ( in general , over emitter s states ) .",
    "thus , one can see that coupling of light modes to the same atom ( emitter ) interacting with the dissipative reservoir under the condition of adiabatic elimination of emitter s variables leads directly to the mode - reservoir interaction terms in the resulting effective hamiltonian .",
    "note , that these terms remain linear in reservoir operators @xmath29 .",
    "hence one can derive a master equation averaging over the reservoir in a standard way . in the appendix",
    "b we give examples of the derivation of effective hamiltonians and the corresponding master equations discussing the simplest two - mode jaynes - cummings system ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "the described scenario of how correlated loss emerge is quite general , and can take place for a wide range of schemes involving light - shift - induced photonic nonlinearities .",
    "a three - level @xmath35-system interacting with classical driving and quantum fields represent a more realistic example of the scheme with the correlated loss .",
    "[ lambda - system ] consider the large cross - kerr nonlinearity generation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "there two modes are coupled to the transition between 1 and 3 levels of the @xmath35-system in presence of two classical driving fields on transitions 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 . in the rotating - wave approximation and in the interaction picture with respect to free hamiltonian of the reservoir ,",
    "the problem is described by the following interaction hamiltonian : @xmath36\\sigma_{13}+\\omega\\exp\\{{{\\rm i}}\\delta_2t\\}\\sigma_{23}+\\mbox{h . c. } , \\label{hamiltonian_lambda_system}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the rabi frequency of the driving fields ; @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; and @xmath40 are the interaction constants for the coupling of a light mode to an emitter ( atom ) . here for simplicity we have taken into account only losses on the transition 1 - 3 .",
    "the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) can be realized in toroidal microcavities , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the clockwise and counter - clockwise propagating modes @xcite .",
    "as usually , we assume the markovian reservoir and the following conditions hold : @xmath41 from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian_lambda_system ] ) , the dynamics is governed by @xmath42(\\sigma_{33}-\\sigma_{11})+{{\\rm i}}\\omega\\exp\\{{{\\rm i}}\\delta_2t\\}\\sigma_{21}. \\label{31equation_lambda_system}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the approach described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that level 3 remains practically unpopulated , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as well as @xmath45 .",
    "thus the @xmath35-system is prepared in the superposition of the metastable levels 1 and 2 ( namely , in the state @xmath46 ) .",
    "then , neglecting small and rapidly oscillating terms , one obtains from eqs.([hamiltonian_lambda_system ] , [ 31equation_lambda_system ] ) the following master equation @xmath47+{1\\over2}\\left[(\\gamma_1-\\gamma_{12 } ) \\mathcal{l}(a_1)+(\\gamma_2-\\gamma_{12})\\mathcal{l}(a_2)\\right]\\rho(t)+ \\\\ { \\gamma_{12}\\over2}\\mathcal{l}(a_1+a_2)\\rho(t ) , \\label{master_lambda_model}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48    the master equation ( [ master_lambda_model ] ) describes the cross - kerr and self - kerr interactions of two light modes plus their coupling to the correlated reservoirs . as follows from the model depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) , it is actually the same reservoir : one can see that @xmath49 .",
    "naturally , loss rates @xmath50 are much less than the loss rate of the emitter .",
    "however , if one deals with input modes in a coherent state of rather large amplitude for generating large cross - kerr nonlinearities , then even comparatively small losses can strongly influence mode dynamics .",
    "below we consider examples of such an influence , e.g. , an example of a single - mode schdinger - cat state .    the occurrence of a correlated modal loss due to presence of the emitter ( atom in our case ) has been noticed in ref .",
    "they have also pointed out that the loss rate should be proportional to the square of the ratio of the mode - emitter interaction constant and the detuning .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize that this loss rate does not depend on the population of level 3 , as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 31equation_lambda_system ] ) .",
    "now let us turn to the specific nonlinear interaction described by the same type of the hamiltonian as in the examples above and in the appendix b. we will consider the effective hamiltonian in the master equation  ( [ master_markov ] ) @xmath51 in the following general form @xmath52 it describes the cross - kerr and self - kerr interaction with nonlinear coefficients @xmath53 of two modes ( or mode superpositions ) @xmath6 and @xmath7 . to solve the problem described by the master equation ( [ master_markov ] ) with the hamiltonian ( [ h_0_kerr ] ) , we adopt a simple and illustrative ` thermofield ' notation @xcite .",
    "essentially , instead of a density matrix acting on some space @xmath54 , say , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the fock state with @xmath57 photons in @xmath54 , we consider a state vector @xmath58 in an extended space @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the fock state with @xmath61 photons in @xmath62 .",

    ". therefore negative regions of the wigner function can not survive losses larger than 50% if these occur during propagation of the generated state .",
    "hence losses that take place in the process of state generation via the cross - kerr interaction are less harmful to the non - classicality of the output state than the same level of loss after the interaction .",
    "as can be seen from the solution ( [ evolution_fock ] ) , an influence of dephasing into independent reservoirs can be profoundly destructive .",
    "dephasing leads to diminishing of the off - diagonal elements in the number - state basis with rates proportional to the difference of these numbers .",

    "dephasing is usually disregarded without being estimated ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since the rate of losses increases with increasing intensity of the coherent states used in the generation process , more caution is required with respect to the dephasing . for schemes involving large cross - kerr nonlinearity in the solid - state structures ( such as , for example , photonic crystals )",
    "emitter - mediated dephasing could be a major source of state decoherence and a reason for failure of schemes involving initial coherent states with large number of photons .",
    "however , remarkably , if the cross - kerr nonlinear interaction scheme is designed in such a way that losses due to dephasing are correlated , then it may be possible to avoid their destructive effects .",
    "this is the subject of the next section .",
    "it is well established , that the states of quantum systems can be correlated and even entangled through interaction with the common reservoir .",
    "this phenomenon can occur even in absence of any direct interaction between systems . in in appendix b3",
    "we give an example of such a phenomenon for a scheme of generating the cross - kerr nonlinearity via dispersive interaction of modes with emitters .",
    "there a beam - splitting action of the common reservoir is considered , and it is shown how such a reservoir can produce a stationary entangled state of two modes .    here we focus our attention on another important possibility : namely , on a way to neutralize a destructive influence of losses in the process of generation by rendering these losses correlated and exploit a correlating effect of the reservoir .",

    "thus , we have seen that by making losses completely correlated one can completely avoid decoherence caused by these losses .",
    "of course , in practice one can hardly have completely correlated reservoirs due to presence of additional uncorrelated loss ( such as modal losses due to coupling to additional reservoirs etc . ) .",
    "nevertheless , designing the scheme such as to have predominantly correlated losses might greatly enhance its robustness in production of non - classical states .",

    "[ fig2](e ) ) .",
    "in what presented here , we followed the quest to find ways to impair the decoherence processes in quantum state generation and manipulation . for the particular class of nonlinear interaction processes ,",
    "we have found two striking examples of loss dynamics , for which the losses themselves counteract decoherence : loss - mediated correlations between the interacting modes and losses to the correlated reservoirs .",
    "the latter result in strongly correlated modal loss .",
    "these correlated losses influence the dynamics of the modes undergoing the cross - kerr nonlinear interaction in a completely different way than losses into independent reservoirs , the aspect of quantum nonlinear dynamics to large extent unexplored so far .",
    "thus , remarkably , designing the schemes for the generation of the kerr nonlinearity in such a way that losses in this process are correlated , one can greatly diminish their destructive impact and even exploit them for entanglement generation ( see also appendix b ) .",
    "as to the origin of this effect , if both modes , for example , interact with the same emitter transition , emitter losses are likely to lead to the correlated loss of both of these modes .",
    "note , that in this case a significant modal loss might occur even in the case when the emitter subject to losses stays in superposition of metastable levels with negligibly small probability to occupy higher , decaying levels . for more details and examples on the origin of the correlated losses and",

    "this is mainly due to the loss - mediated correlations between the modes participating in the cross - kerr interaction .",
    "in addition , losses through coupling to the correlated reservoirs ( correlated loss ) further enhance the difference between the decoherence processes _ during _ and _ after _ the state generation",
