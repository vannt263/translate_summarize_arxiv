    "since the first demonstration of ultra - slow light propagation through a bose - einstein condensate ( bec)@xcite , a major application of slow light has been argued to be an optical memory@xcite .",
    "information storage capacity of such an optical memory based upon slowing laser pulses down to subluminal speeds in becs would strongly depend on the temporal width of the pulses .",
    "as the temporal width of the pulses gets smaller , condensate could contain more pulses in a given time interval .",
    "unfortunately , one can not hope for using shortest pulses ( such as femtosecond or even attosecond ) available to maximize information capacity . a challenging issue to use such a short pulse in condensates is the fact that slow - light scheme in bec is based upon electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit)@xcite which occurs for not so broad optical frequency window . on the other hand ,",
    "temporally short pulses have large frequency widths .",
    "present experimental set ups use optical pulses of temporal widths in the order of microseconds .",
    "we note that eit conditions can be reasonably well satisfied for pulses of widths @xmath0 which would enhance the information capacity of the condensate ten times more .",
    "another challenging issue in using short pulses in becs is that their susceptibility to dispersion which may distort the pulse shape .",
    "we note that even though dispersive effects have been found small experimentally for microsecond pulses , there is no guarantee that role of dispersion would be small when we make the pulse ten times shorter .",
    "as the earlier theoretical models ignore the dispersion completely@xcite , it is necessary to develop a more general theory of slow light propagation taking into account the higher order dispersive properties of the bec . in the present paper",
    "we develop such a theory , generalizing theory of dispersive eit in a thermal uniform gas@xcite . using our general theory ,",
    "we have found that dispersive effects are insignificant for microsecond pulses used in slow - light experiments .",
    "however , temporal width of microsecond is the critical width below which dispersion starts to distort the pulse shape .",
    "we show that at a width of @xmath1 , dispersion leads to a small temporal broadening of the pulse .",
    "it may be noted here that study of dispersive effects in slow  short - light propagation may lead to alternative applications such as determination of condensate temperature through measurement of broadening , pulse shape engineering , and frequency band narrowing . while we treat the light classically , novel effects have been predicted for slow - light in quantum regime , in particular a new nonlinearity regime for quantum light@xcite .",
    "our results may contribute to such studies as well .",
    "furthermore , the theory in the present paper can easily be extended to situations in which bec can have an enhanced nonlinear optical response of bec that might be utilized for dispersion compensation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , electric susceptibility of an interacting bec under eit conditions is derived . in sect .",
    "3 , wave equation including the high order dispersive terms for the eit medium is derived .",
    "we present and discuss our numerical results in section 4 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 5 .",

    "effect of second order dispersion is a small broadening in the temporal pulse width as demonstrated in fig.[fig2 ] , where , behavior of the pulse about the center of the condensate , where the dispersive effects are most influential , is shown .    detailed investigation of behavior of even shorter pulses require more intensive numerical studies and will be published elsewhere .",
    "wave equation is solved via finite difference crank - nicholson space marching scheme .",
    "the crank - nicholson scheme is less stable but more accurate than the fully implicit method ; it takes the average between the implicit and the explicit schemes@xcite .",

    ". therefore dispersive effects , in particular temporal broadening of the pulse , can be seen within the short ( micrometer ) length of bec .",
    "normally , one would need much longer distances to be covered with the pulse propagating in other more usual medium such as an optical fiber .",
    "though dispersion has no effect on the slowing down the pulse , slow group velocity makes the dispersion visible in such a short distance .",
    "we examined propagation of short laser pulses in a bose - einstein condensate taking into account the dispersive effects under the conditions for electromagnetically induced transparency .",
