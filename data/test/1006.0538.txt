    "methanol masers are commonly found in massive star - forming regions , with more than twenty different centimetre and millimetre wavelength masing transitions discovered to date ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "all methanol maser transitions do not share the same behaviour .",
    "empirically , they form two classes @xcite .",
    "class  i methanol masers ( e.g. at 36 , 44 , 84 , and 95  ghz ) usually occur in multiple locations across the star - forming region scattered around an area up to a parsec in extent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , class  ii methanol masers ( e.g. at 6.7 , 12 and 107  ghz ) reside in the close vicinity of exciting young stellar objects ( ysos ) and are typically found as a single cluster of emission at arcsecond resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical calculations are able to explain this empirical classification and strongly suggest that the pumping process of class  i masers is dominated by collisions with molecular hydrogen , in contrast to class  ii masers which are pumped by radiative excitation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the morphology of class  i methanol masers has recently become the focus of high angular resolution studies aimed at searching for associations with other phenomena commonly observed in regions of high - mass star - formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the common consensus is that the majority of class  i masers trace interface regions between outflows and molecular gas , although direct observational evidence of this has been obtained for a limited number of sources only ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the alternative scenarios involving cloud - cloud collisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as the interaction of expanding hii regions with the ambient molecular environment @xcite may also be realised in some sources .",
    "the common point of all these scenarios is the presence of shocked gas , where the physical conditions are favouring class  i methanol masers ( see the discussion in section  [ hv_discussion ] below ) .",
    "apart from the outflow associations cited above ( based on the 2.12-@xmath2 m h@xmath4 emission , which is a well known shock tracer ) , @xcite reported association of some class  i maser spots with the extended features showing a prominent excess of the 4.5-@xmath2 m emission in the images obtained with the spitzer space telescope s infrared array camera ( irac ) , also known as extended green objects ( egos ; * ? ? ? * ) or `` green fuzzies '' @xcite .",
    "the excess of the 4.5-@xmath2 m ( irac band 2 ) emission could be a result of shock excitation of molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide in protostellar outflows @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite demonstrated statistically the presence of an ego in the vicinity of a large fraction of class  i methanol masers at low angular resolution ( single dish positions ) . to increase the number of class  i masers studied at high angular resolution and to compare the morphologies observed in different maser transitions we carried out an interferometric survey at 36 and 44  ghz of all class  i masers previously reported in the literature and located south of declination @xmath035 . in this letter",
    ", we present a study of g309.38@xmath00.13 , an especially interesting source from the survey .",
    "it represents the level of morphological and kinematical complexity encountered for the majority of sources observed in the survey , but it has a distinct high - velocity maser feature at 36-ghz , which was quite unexpected ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this maser is found in an area devoid of bright radio - continuum emission , but near infrared sources which are presumably embedded stars .",
    "it is located approximately 20offset from the prominent hii region gum  48d at the heliocentric distance of about 3.5  kpc ( for further information on the region see * ? ? ?",
    "0.13 region .",
    "the emission in 8.0 , 4.5 and 3.6  @xmath2 m irac spitzer bands is shown as red , green and blue , respectively .",
    "the filled red circles show the fitted position of the strongest spectral component at each location , while the weaker components are shown by yellow crosses ( all components are given in table  [ fit_results ] ) . the location of a class  ii 6.7-ghz methanol maser @xcite is shown by the white cross .",
    "the contours show the maximum of the 36-ghz emission across all spectral channels .",
    "the levels are 5 , 15 , 50 and 90 per cent of the peak 36-ghz flux density of 16.1  jy .",
    "low level artefacts in the top right corner are caused by the primary beam correction . ]",
    "observations were made with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in may 2007 as part of the interferometric survey of southern class  i methanol masers at 36 and 44  ghz ( project code c1642 ) .",
    "the source was observed using the hybrid h214c array configuration in a few 3 minute cuts ( four cuts at 36  ghz and six at 44  ghz ) spread in hour angle for better uv - coverage .",
    "we did not use , for imaging , the data from the ca06 antenna ( located about 4.5  km to the west of the other 5 antennas ) .",
    "the remaining antennas provided baselines ranging from 82 to 240  m. the position of the phase and pointing centre was @xmath52601 , @xmath6181166 .",
    "we used reference pointing procedures and determined corrections using the continuum source 1414 - 59 ( which served also as a phase calibrator ) . from the statistics of pointing solutions",
    "the reference pointing accuracy was estimated to be 48@xmath726 .",
    "this accuracy affects the accuracy of flux density measurements , particularly for sources of emission which are offset from the pointing centre .",
    "the positional accuracy of the maser locations depends on the quality of the phase calibration and is believed to be better than 0.5  arcsec .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was bootstrapped from observation of uranus ( assumed flux densities were 1.38 and 1.98  jy at 36 and 44  ghz respectively ) .",
    "we estimate the flux scale to be accurate to about 20% .",
    "the correlator was configured to split 8  mhz bandwidth into 1024  spectral channels .",
    "the resulting spectral resolution and velocity range covered are given in table  [ obsdetails ] along with other observing parameters .",
    "most columns of table  [ obsdetails ] are self - explanatory and include , in addition to above , the molecular transition and its rest frequency ( adopted from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and position angle ( p.a . ) of the synthesised beam reflecting the spatial resolution , as well as the size of the primary beam which determines the field of view .",
    "the 1@xmath8 rms noise given in the seventh column is a median value of rms noise levels obtained for each individual spectral plane of the image cube prior to the primary beam correction ( i.e. with constant noise across the field of view ) . scaled up with the primary beam , it represents the 1@xmath8 detection limit of these observations at a particular location .",
    "it is worth mentioning , however , that the ability to detect weak features is notably reduced within the velocity range of strong emission due to dynamic range limitations , which were largely a result of sparse uv - coverage .",
    "we estimate the dynamic range ( the ratio of peak flux to rms noise in the image ) to be about 90 and 400 for the 36 and 44-ghz image cubes , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty of the radial velocity corresponding to the rest frequency uncertainty is given in the ninth column of table  [ obsdetails ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,^,<,^,^,^,>,^ , > \" , ]",
    "the blue - shifted spectral component corresponding to location  e is a remarkable feature of this maser source .",
    "more commonly , the observed velocities of class  i methanol masers are no more than a few km  s@xmath3 from the velocity of the ambient molecular cloud , and the velocity dispersion is low  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the notable exception with a high velocity dispersion is g1.6@xmath00.025 , which has emission components at radial velocities ranging from 0 to 160  km  s@xmath3  @xcite",
    "however , unlike g309.38@xmath00.13 , the emission in g1.6@xmath00.025 corresponds to distinct , but interacting , molecular clumps detected also in a number of thermal transitions of various molecules  @xcite .",
    "the large velocity difference between individual clumps reflects a violent environment and the exceptional kinematics in the vicinity of the galactic centre .",
    "in contrast , the g309.38@xmath00.13 region is close to the tangential direction of the sagittarius - carina arm ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ? * ) where the extreme velocity of  e ( @xmath080  km  s@xmath3 ) makes an association with an unrelated molecular cloud highly unlikely .",
    "this is corroborated by the @xmath9co brightness temperature limit of 0.1  k at the radial velocities below @xmath070  km  s@xmath3 obtained with the 4-m nanten telescope  @xcite .",
    "this limit is two orders of magnitude lower than the peak @xmath9co brightness temperature observed near @xmath050  km  s@xmath3 in the g309.38@xmath00.13 region ( nearest @xmath10co clump mass is about 10@xmath11  m@xmath12 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is close to the velocities of most of the maser spots .",
    "we conclude that the high - velocity 36-ghz maser in  e most likely reflects the presence of a molecular outflow , rather than a separate molecular cloud projecting onto the same location by chance .",
    "the area around  b and  e is characterised by the presence of shocked gas traced by a strong ego ( fig .",
    "[ glm_mas_overlay ] ) .",
    "this supports the idea that an outflow is present .",
    "the close spatial location of  b and  e and the presence of the class  ii methanol maser ( which indicates the presence of a high - mass yso ) in the vicinity both suggest that the outflow axis is close to the line of sight .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the interaction between outflows and the ambient material is believed to be responsible for the majority of class  i methanol masers .",
    "the production of methanol by purely gas - phase chemical reactions is quite inefficient , but the passage of weak shocks is expected to release methanol from the grain mantles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "enhanced methanol abundance arising from shocks driven by outflows into the ambient cloud has also been confirmed observationally  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , outflows compress the medium , which makes collisions more frequent and the pumping mechanism more efficient",
    ". however , methanol is expected to survive sputtering and desorption of grain mantles only if the shocks are relatively mild , i.e. at shock velocities not greatly exceeding 10  km  s@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of a maser feature offset by 30  km  s@xmath3 with respect to the velocity of the ambient gas is somewhat surprising .",
    "this discrepancy can be resolved if the outflow interacts with a moving parcel of gas . in this case",
    ", the same radial velocity of the maser can be achieved for a lower shock velocity .",
    "the mechanism of this gas acceleration is unknown at present",
    ". it could be by a previous outflow event or a different outflow from another yso .",
    "in addition , the clustered environment of high - mass star formation opens a range of possibilities for gravitational acceleration of gas clumps  ( e.g. mechanisms which caused radial velocity outliers observed in clusters of low - mass protostars by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one may speculate that the curved morphology of the ego associated with  b and  e ( fig .",
    "[ glm_mas_overlay ] ) suggests interaction with an outflow coming from the south - west ( the general direction of the hii region gum  48d )",
    ". this may be the additional outflow responsible for the unusual kinematics .",
    "however , the distance of gum  48d is estimated to be 3.5  kpc @xcite , and therefore gum  48d must be at least 20  pc away from the maser . a separation of the terminal shock from the driving source as large as this is unprecedented ( e.g. the outflow studied by @xcite extends only up to 1.5  pc ) and suggests that , if the ego is indeed shaped by the second outflow , the driving source is not the star responsible for the excitation of gum  48d .",
    "an inspection of table  [ fit_results ] and fig .",
    "[ spectra ] suggests that the 36 to 44-ghz flux density ratio varies significantly from component to component .",
    "the majority of maser features were detected in a single transition only and most striking is the lack of a 36-ghz counterpart to the brightest 44-ghz spectral feature ( fig  [ spectra]c ) .",
    "although the velocities corresponding to  e ( high - velocity feature ) were not covered by the 44-ghz measurement , the preliminary results of a follow up observation carried out with the mopra 22-m single dish in january 2010 showed no 44-ghz methanol ( as well as no 48-ghz methanol , sio 1 - 0 , and cs 1 - 0 ) emission near @xmath080  km  s@xmath3 above 1.3  jy . with the caveat about possible temporal variability over the 2.5-year timescale , this situation represents another extreme case of a 36-ghz maser without a 44-ghz counterpart .",
    "the numerical models of @xcite suggest that the 44-ghz masers are quite sensitive to the geometry of the maser region . unlike 36-ghz masers , which can be produced in the spherically symmetric case , an optical depth along the line of sight higher than in the orthogonal direction seems to be the key property required to produce bright 44-ghz masers .",
    "one could expect this elongation of the gas clumps involved in the maser action to be somehow related to the outflow orientation and morphology .",
    "however , the complexity of the maser spot distribution ( see fig .  [ glm_mas_overlay ] ) does not allow us to interpret the flux density ratios for each spot in a consistent manner based on just the spot location with respect to the suspected outflow ( the position of the 6.7-ghz maser presumably marks the location of the yso driving the outflow roughly along the line of sight ) .",
    "1 .   spots of class  i methanol maser emission in g309.38@xmath00.13 are spread over an area 50@xmath130 in extent ( see table  [ fit_results ] and fig .  [ glm_mas_overlay ] ) .",
    "both 36 and 44-ghz maser emission was detected at two locations , while the emission from the remaining locations was detected at a single frequency only ( see fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "we report the detection of a high - velocity spectral feature at 36  ghz , blue - shifted by about 30  km  s@xmath3 from the peak velocity .",
    "this is the largest velocity offset reported so far for a class  i methanol maser source associated with a single molecular cloud .",
    "the maser corresponding to this feature ( labelled  e ) is located within a few seconds of arc of the maser at  b ( the brightest spectral feature at both frequencies ) indicating a possible association with an outflow parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the results highlight the importance of not only high spectral and spatial resolution for studies of class  i methanol masers , but also ample velocity coverage and a field of view wider than the typical primary beam size of available instruments .",
    "all observational data gathered so far lack at least one ( and sometimes all ) of these properties .",
    "in addition , the results show that the 36 and 44-ghz transitions are very complementary to each other .",
    "the high - velocity spectral feature in g309.38@xmath00.13 is a good example of a phenomenon which has been missed by previous maser surveys .",
