    "systems whose thermodynamic parameters are drastically changed give rise to highly nonlinear and far from equilibrium processes that have been intensively studied for decades in various contexts @xcite .",
    "these may range from binary fluids to alloys and spin systems exhibiting a disordered phase at high temperatures , whilst having two or more ordered phases below a critical point @xcite .",
    "there is already a vast body of research studying such nonequilibrium problems in terms of kinetic ising models @xcite under both glauber and kawasaki dynamics @xcite , respectively associated with the so called models @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the terminology of critical dynamic theories @xcite . after a quench to a subcritical temperature",
    "these dynamics attempt to minimize the interfacial energy between different equilibrium domains which therefore grow and coarsen with time . at late stages",
    "the spreading of domains is such that if their typical lengths are rescaled by a factor @xmath2 the domain patterns at different times will be statistically similar . here , the scaling or dynamic exponent @xmath3 is characteristic of the universality class to which the dynamic belongs , and is usually independent of the spatial dimensionality but sensitive to conservation laws ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    for one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems these dynamics",
    "are also amenable to experimental probe @xcite .",
    "in particular , the magnetic relaxation of synthesized molecular chains with strong ising anisotropy @xcite was considered in the framework of a glauber dynamics with both first- and second - neighbor interactions @xmath4 @xcite . in that regard , recently it was suggested that weak competing regimes in the low but nonzero - temperature limit ( @xmath5 ) give rise to an almost ballistic dynamic exponent ( @xmath6 ) @xcite rather than the usual diffusive value of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "irrespective of how small the frustration might be , note that for @xmath8 such discontinuous scaling behavior is also accompanied by the sudden appearance of a large basin of metastable states @xcite .",
    "when it comes to the ferromagnetic kawasaki dynamics , these latter already exist for @xmath9 and are characterized by kinks or domain walls separated by two or more lattice spacings @xcite .",
    "in that situation the mean density of kinks reaches a finite value @xcite , and so the average size of metastable domains can not but remain bounded . at zero temperature the dynamics rapidly gets stuck in these states -thus preventing the system to reach equilibrium- but for @xmath5 their structure is at the origin of the @xmath10 growth of domain length scales @xcite . despite metastability , note that as long as temperature is held finite , no matter how small , the dynamics is still ergodic and eventually the equilibrium state is accessible .    continuing the development initiated in ref.@xcite , in this work",
    "we further investigate the metastable effects brought about by second neighbor couplings on the scaling regimes of this typical phase separation dynamics .",
    "as we shall see , for @xmath11 there are new metastable scenarios and activation barriers that come into play , ultimately affecting the large time kinetics in the low temperature limit .    following the methodology of ref.@xcite ,",
    "first we will construct and diagonalize numerically the kink evolution operator associated to the master equation @xcite of this dynamics in finite chains .",
    "this will enable us to determine the relaxation time ( @xmath12 ) of these processes from the spectral gaps of that liouvillian operator .",
    "as is known , in nearing a critical point those time scales diverge with the equilibrium correlation length as @xmath13 @xcite , which in the present context also grows unbounded in the limit of @xmath14 ( except for @xmath15 where the ground state is highly degenerate and @xmath16 remains finite @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in a system of typical length @xmath17 evidently @xmath16 can not grow beyond that scale ; hence in practice it is customary to trade that scaling relation by the finite - size behavior @xmath18 provided @xmath17 is taken sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "thus , once armed with the above referred spectral gaps we will aim at obtaining dynamic exponents from this finite - size scaling relation across a host of metastable situations . at low but nonzero - temperatures , however notice that owing to the presence of arrhenius activation energies the time scales involved are unbounded even for finite systems ( cf .",
    "sec.iv ) .",
    "the structure of this work is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we recast the master equation of these stochastic processes in terms of a quantum spin analogy that readily lends itself to evaluate the low lying levels of the associated evolution operator . owing to detailed balance @xcite this latter",
    "can be brought to a symmetric representation by means of simple nonunitary spin transformations , thus simplifying the subsequent numerical analysis .",
    "sec.iii describes various metastable regimes while attempting to identify their decay patterns and activation barriers .",
    "calculational details regarding the proliferation rates of these states with the system size are relegated to appendix a. in sec.iv we evaluate numerically the spectrum gaps of finite chains using standard recursive techniques @xcite which yield clear arrhenius trends for relaxation times at low temperature regimes .",
    "this provides a sequence of finite - size approximants to dynamic exponents which are then combined with extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "finally , sec.v contains a summarizing discussion along with some remarks on open issues and prospects of future work .",
    "let us consider the kawasaki dynamics in a chain of ising spins ( @xmath19 ) coupled with both first- and second - neighbor interactions @xmath4 , thus setting energy configurations @xmath20 while in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath21 . here",
    ", frustration arises when combining antiferromagnetic ( af ) @xmath22 couplings ( @xmath23 ) with @xmath24 exchanges of any sign .",
    "in particular , for @xmath25 the ground state consists of consecutive pairs of oppositely oriented spins ( @xmath26 ) , while for @xmath27 the ordering is f or af depending on the respective sign of @xmath24 . for @xmath28",
    "there is no frustration and the order type is also set by @xmath24 . unless otherwise stated , periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and a vanishing magnetization will be assumed throughout .",
    "the bath is represented as causing the ising states @xmath29 to fluctuate by exchanges of nearest neighbor ( nn ) spin pairs chosen randomly from @xmath17 locations . to enforce the system to relax towards the boltzmann distribution @xmath30 ,",
    "the transition probability rates per unit time @xmath31 between two configurations @xmath32 ( here differing just in an exchanged pair of nn spins ) , are chosen to satisfy the detailed balance condition @xcite @xmath33 ( also , see its role by the end of sec.iia ) .",
    "however , detailed balance itself can not determine entirely the form of such rates , thus in what follows we take up the common choice used in the context of kinetic ising models , namely @xcite @xmath34\\,\\big\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 just sets the time scale of the microscopic process , and is hereafter set to 1 .",
    "also , from now on temperatures are measured in energy units , or , equivalently , the boltzmann constant in @xmath36 is taken equal to unity . in the specific case of spin exchanges ,",
    "say at locations @xmath37 , clearly from eq.([energy ] ) the above energy differences reduce to @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "thus , after introducing the parameters    @xmath39    ( @xmath40 ) and using basic properties of hyperbolic functions , it is a straightforward matter to verify that the exchange rates @xmath41 associated to those locations actually deploy multi - spin terms of the form @xmath42\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which already anticipate the type of many - body interactions to be found later on in the evolution operator of sec.iia . here , the factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 ensure vanishing rates for parallel spins while contributing to reproduce eq.([choice ] ) for antiparallel ones",
    "also , note that although the standard case of @xmath9 is left with terms of just two - spin interactions , its dynamics is _ not _ yet amenable for exact analytic treatments at @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the range of the sites involved in eq.([rates ] ) , or equivalently , in the energy differences of eq.([choice ] ) , basically distinguishes between eight situations of spin exchanges . for later convenience",
    "we now regroup them in two sets of dual events in which kinks or ferromagnetic domain walls are thought of as hard core particles @xmath0 undergoing pairing @xmath46 , and diffusion @xmath47 processes , as schematized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "its columns also summarize the information needed to construct the operational form of the dynamics , while allowing to infer the variety of metastable structures alluded to in sec.i . in what follows",

    "conveniently , this relation can also be reinterpreted as a schrdinger equation in imaginary time , i.e. @xmath85 under a pseudo - hamiltonian or evolution operator @xmath86 .",
    "this is readily set up by defining diagonal and nondiagonal matrix elements @xcite    @xmath87    thus formally enabling to derive the state of the system @xmath88 at subsequent times from the action of @xmath86 on a given initial condition , that is @xmath89 .",
    "in particular the relaxation time @xmath12 of any observable with nonzero matrix element between the steady state and the first excitation mode of @xmath86 , is singled out by the eigenvalue @xmath90 corresponding to that latter , i.e. @xmath91 , whereas by construction the former merely yields an eigenvalue @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "note that the numerical analysis of these spectral gaps ( or inverse relaxation times ) will first require to obtain an operational analog of eqs.([diag ] ) and ( [ non - diag ] ) , as the phase - space dimension of these processes grows exponentially with the system size . that will allow us to implement the recursive diagonalization techniques of sec.iv , where the matrix representation of @xmath86 is not actually stored in memory @xcite .    on the other hand , to halve the number of machine operations it is convenient here to turn to a dual description in which new ising variables @xmath93 standing on dual chain locations denote the presence ( @xmath94 ) or absence ( @xmath95 ) of the kinks referred to above .",
    "thus , if we think of the states @xmath96 as representing configurations of @xmath97-spinors ( say in the @xmath3 direction ) , we can readily construct the counterpart of the above matrix elements by means of usual raising and lowering operators @xmath98 .",
    "clearly , the nondiagonal parts @xmath99 accounting for the kink pairing and diffusion processes depicted in table  [ tab1 ] must involve respectively terms of the form @xmath100 and @xmath101 , say for events occurring at locations @xmath102 under the presence of a central kink .",
    "however , due to the @xmath22-couplings , note that these terms should also comprise the kink occupation @xmath103 and vacancy @xmath104 numbers of second neighbor sites surrounding that central kink , as these also matter in the rate values of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "thus , to weight such correlated processes here we classify them according to projectors defined as @xmath105 to which in turn we assign the variables @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , with the aid of these latter , the contributions of the pairing and diffusion parts to the operational analog of eq.([non - diag ] ) can now be written down as    @xmath108\\,,\\\\ \\label{diffusion } h_{nd}^{^{(di\\!f\\!f ) } } & = & -   \\sum_{i,\\,j}\\,{\\cal \\hat p}_i^{(j ) } \\big[\\,f ( y_j)\\ ,   \\sigma^+_{i-1}\\,\\sigma^-_{i+1 } + f ( -y_j)\\,\\sigma^+_{i+1}\\,\\sigma^-_{i-1}\\,\\big]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath109 , and the @xmath110 index runs over the four types of projectors specified in eq.([proj ] ) .    when it comes to the diagonal terms associated with eq.([diag ] )",
    ", in turn needed for conservation of probability , notice that these basically count the number of manners in which a given configuration can evolve to different ones in a single step . in the kink representation",
    "this amounts to the summation of all pairing and diffusion attempts that a given state is capable of . as before ,",
    "these attempts also can be probed and weighted by means of the above projectors , vacancy , and number operators , in terms of which those diagonal contributions are expressed here as    @xmath111\\,,\\\\ h_d^{^{(diff)}}\\!\\!\\!\\ ! & = &    \\sum_{i,\\,j}\\,{\\cal \\hat p}_i^{(j ) } \\big[\\,f ( -y_j)\\ ,   \\hat{\\rm v}_{i-1}\\ , \\hat n_{i+1 } +   f ( y_j)\\,\\hat n_{i-1}\\ , \\hat{\\rm v}_{i+1}\\,\\big]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , after simple algebraic steps and using the @xmath112 parameters defined in eqs.([cpm ] ) and ( [ dpm ] ) , the net contribution @xmath113 of these diagonal terms is found to involve two- , three- , and four - body interactions of the form @xmath114\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] some of which had already appeared at the level of the original spin rates mentioned in eq.([rates ] ) .    _ detailed balance_. further to the correlated pairing and diffusion terms of eqs.([pairing]),([diffusion ] ) which would leave us with a non - symmetric representation of the evolution operator , we can make some progress here by exploiting detailed balance [ eq.([db ] ) ] .",
    "this latter warrants the existence of representations in which @xmath86 is symmetric and thereby fully diagonalizable @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", it suffices to consider the _ diagonal _ nonunitary similarity transformation @xmath115\\,,\\ ] ] stemming from the original spin energies of eq.([energy ] ) but re - expressed in terms of kinks , i.e. @xmath116 . hence @xmath117 , implying that the nondiagonal matrix elements of @xmath118 will transform as @xmath119 but since in the kink representation @xmath120 also comply with the detailed balance condition ( [ db ] ) , then clearly these elements become symmetric under @xmath121 ( see the symmetrized elements of table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , under eq.([transf ] ) the pairing and diffusion operators involved in eqs.([pairing ] ) and ( [ diffusion ] ) will transform respectively as    @xmath122\\ ; \\sigma^{\\pm}_{i-1 } \\,\\sigma^{\\pm}_{i+1}\\;,\\\\ \\phantom{\\big [ } \\sigma^{\\pm}_{i-1 } \\,\\sigma^{\\mp}_{i+1 }   & \\to & \\exp \\big [   \\pm k_2 \\left (    \\sigma^z_{i-2 } -   \\sigma^z_{i+2}\\right ) \\big]\\ ; \\sigma^{\\pm}_{i-1 } \\,\\sigma^{\\mp}_{i+1}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while leaving @xmath123 and all projectors of eq.([proj ] ) unchanged .",
    "thus , after introducing the @xmath124 and @xmath125 coefficients    @xmath126    it is straightforward to check that the symmetric counterparts of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are then given by    @xmath129 \\ , \\left(\\,\\sigma^+_{i-1}\\,\\sigma^+_{i+1 } + { \\rm h.c.}\\,\\right)\\,,\\\\ \\label{s - diffusion } { \\cal h}_{nd}^{^{(di\\!f\\!f ) } } & = & - \\frac{1}{8}\\,\\left(\\,1 + { \\rm sech}\\ , 2k_2 \\ , \\right)\\,\\sum_i \\,\\left(1+\\sigma^z_i\\right )   \\left(\\,1+\\tanh^2\\!k_2\\ ; \\sigma^z_{i-2}\\ ,   \\sigma^z_{i+2}\\,\\right ) \\,\\left(\\,\\sigma^+_{i-1}\\,\\sigma^-_{i+1 } + { \\rm h.c.}\\,\\right)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    together with eq.([diagonal ] ) this completes the construction of the operational analog of eqs.([diag ] ) and ( [ non - diag ] ) in an hermitian representation . in passing ,",
    "it is worth to point out that all above non - diagonal operators not only preserve the parity of kinks @xmath130 ( being even for pbc ) , but that they also commute , by construction , with @xmath131 which simply re - expresses the conservation of the total spin magnetization in the original system . in practice , for the numerical evaluation of spectral gaps ( sec.iv ) we will just build up the adequate basis of kink states from the corresponding spin ones .",
    "after an instantaneous quench down to a low but non - zero temperature often this stochastic dynamics rapidly reaches a state in which further energy - lowering processes are unlikely .",
    "this is because the configuration space contains ` basins ' of local energy minima from which the chances to access lower energy states must first find their way through a typical ` energy barrier ' @xmath132 . in the limit of @xmath14 the average time spent in these configuration , or metastable ( m ) states ,",
    "then diverges with an arrhenius factor @xmath133 . in common with the standard ferromagnetic dynamics , here the decay from these m - configurations",
    "is mediated by diffusion of kink pairs . in particular , for @xmath9 their release requires activation energies of @xmath134 which at low - temperatures involves time scales @xmath135 ( see pairing rates of table  [ tab1 ] ) . as a result of the diffusion of these pairs , entire ferromagnetic domains can move rigidly by one lattice spacing @xcite . following an argumentation given in refs.@xcite , the repeated effect of that rather long process ultimately leads to coarsening of domains , and is at the root of their @xmath136 growth @xcite .",
    "for @xmath137 however there are other energy barriers that also come into play , so the identification of a net arrhenius factor in the actual relaxation time is less straightforward .",
    "in addition , due to the discontinuities already appearing at the level of transition rates ( specifically at @xmath138 in the limit of @xmath14 ) , note that there are several coupling regimes where that identification must be carried out .",
    "as we shall see , that will prove much helpful in the finite - size scaling analysis of sec.iv thus , here we focus attention on the variety of m - structures arising in the coupling sectors _ ( a ) _ to _ ( h ) _ listed in table  [ tab2 ] . reasoning with table  [ tab1 ] and guided by simulated quenches down to @xmath139 , we turn to the characterization of these structures while trying to identify their decay patterns . also , a measure of the basin of these states , such as the rate at which they proliferate with the system size , is provided with the aid of appendix a. the results of the arguments and observations that follow in this section are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .    0.2 cm    c c c c coupling regime & typical m - state & rates ( @xmath140 ) & barrier ( @xmath141 ) +   + @xmath142 & 0.7 cm @xmath143{\\,0\\ , \\cdots\\,}_{\\rm v\\,\\ge 1}\\ , { \\blue\\bf 1}\\ ; 0\\ , \\cdots$ ] & -0.8 cm 1.6180 & @xmath144     + @xmath145 & 0.7 cm @xmath146{\\underbracket[0.5pt]{\\,0\\ , \\cdots\\,}_{\\rm v\\ , \\ge 1}\\ , { \\blue\\bf 1}\\ ,   \\underbracket[0.5pt]{\\,0\\ , \\cdots\\,}_{\\rm v'\\,\\ge 1}}^{\\rm v\\,\\,\\,or\\,\\,\\ , v'\\,>\\ , 1}\\ ,   { \\blue\\bf 1}\\ , \\cdots$ ] & -0.8 cm 1.5701 & @xmath144     + -1.5 cm _ ( c ) _",

    "this constraint brings about even further reductions in the number of m - states which actually now grows as @xmath173 ( appendix a ) .",
    "however , this new minimum separation of kinks has no effect in the decay pattern mentioned in the previous two cases , so here the arrhenius factors can also be expected to diverge as @xmath174 . as before , this will be corroborated in sec.iva",

    "( f)_. as suggested by simulated quenches down to @xmath139 , for vanishing magnetization there are no consecutive vacancies in the m - states of this regime @xcite .",
    "since here @xmath199 and @xmath200 , then following table  [ tab1 ] these configurations should be consistent with single and , at most , four contiguous kinks scattered throughout",
    ". however , for @xmath201 it turns out that just single and double kinks actually show up @xcite .",
    "the recursions of appendix a then show that these tighter constraints give rise to a number of m - states which proliferates only as @xmath202 .",
    "as for the manner in which such configurations proceed to equilibrium , contrary to the previous situations it is difficult to identify here a specific pattern of decay .",
    "rather , we content ourselves with mentioning that the largest energy barrier of these states ( i.e. @xmath203 actually corresponding to the activation of diffusing pairs ) , turns out to be associated with the actual relaxation times @xmath204 evaluated by the exact diagonalizations of sec.ivc .    0.25 cm _ ( g ) _ and _ ( h)_. for these two last sectors the signs of @xmath175 and @xmath205 remain as in the previous case , though now @xmath160 is positive .",
    "thus , following table  [ tab1 ] , as before only single and double kinks may appear distributed throughout but now they can be separated by one or more vacancies , even for @xmath206 .",
    "thereby , kink pairs are able to diffuse freely ( @xmath188 ) across consecutive vacancies while keeping at least one space from each other and other kinks .",
    "so , the typical m - state of these sectors actually results in an alternating sequence of mobile and jammed blocks . in these latter",
    "there can be just one vacancy aside each kink pair , whereas single kinks may appear separated by one or more spaces .",

    "as mentioned in sec.ii we focus on the case of vanishing magnetization in the original spin model , thus corresponding to a subspace of @xmath215 kink states .",
    "as a preliminary test first we verified that the transformed boltzmann distribution @xmath216 resulting from eq.([transf ] ) , actually yields the ground state of our quantum ` hamiltonian ' with eigenvalue @xmath217 .",

    "this allowed us to obtain the first excited eigenmodes of the evolution operator in periodic chains of up to @xmath219 sites , the main limitation for this being the exponential growth of the space dimensionality .",
    "another restrictive issue we are confronted with is that as temperature decreases the spectral gaps ( @xmath90 ) get arbitrarily small due to the energy barriers mentioned in sec.iii , i.e. @xmath220 . on the other hand , to ensure that these finite - size quantities are actually scaled within the arrhenius regime , in this context it is more appropriate to put forward a ` normalized ' version of the scaling hypothesis ( [ scaling ] ) , namely @xmath221 where the amplitude @xmath0 would involve at most a @xmath4 dependent quantity ( assuming @xmath17 is large enough ) .",
    "moreover , alike dynamic exponents such proportionality factors will also come out as sector - wise universal constants . in practice , below @xmath222 the evaluation of ( [ normalization ] )",

    "an improved estimation of dynamic exponents can be made by introducing the sequence of approximants or effective exponents @xmath295 } { \\ln[\\,(l\\!-\\!2)/l\\,]}\\,,\\ ] ] each of which simply derives a measure of @xmath3 from the gaps of successive chain lengths .",
    "similarly , it is worth introducing a sequence of approximants to the amplitudes involved in eq.([normalization ] ) , as their common saturation values strongly suggest that these quantities are robust within each coupling sector of table  [ tab2 ] .",

    "it is never really clear whether the assumed asymptotic behavior is sufficiently well realized by the data available @xcite , those differences might well be ascribed to our finite - size limitations . in that sense ,",

    "it is also worth pointing out that for the standard ferromagnetic case of @xmath9 the differences between our higher approximants , namely @xmath315 and @xmath316 , are both less than 0.02% [ also see fig.[two](a ) ] .",

    "the relaxation times of these former were then evaluated numerically in finite chains by analyzing the spectral gaps associated with those hamiltonians using standard recursive methods @xcite .",
    "we focused attention on the low but nonzero - temperature regimes where magnetic domains tend to coarsen and relaxation times can grow arbitrarily large -even for finite chains- due to the activation barriers discussed through secs.iii and iv .",
    "the usual finite - size scaling hypothesis ( [ scaling ] ) was then ` normalized ' as in eq.([normalization ] ) so as to actually scale the spectral gaps of each sector within their corresponding arrhenius regimes .    at time",
    "scales of order @xmath322 the decay patterns of sectors _ ( a ) _ to _ ( d ) _ were argued to be those of the standard ferromagnetic case @xcite , although the proliferation of metastable states in sectors _ ( b ) _ and _ ( c ) _ turns out to be smaller .",
    "however , those differences appear to have no effect on the dynamic exponents , at least within the confidence intervals estimated in the extrapolations of sec.ivd [ eq.([extrapol ] ) and fig.[eight](a ) ] . by contrast",
    ", those extrapolations yielded nearly ballistic values for the exponents of sector _",
    ", on the other hand conjectured to decay through times @xmath323 in a rather different form .",
    "note here then the abrupt crossover of scaling regimes in passing from sector _ ( d ) _ to _",
    "( e)_. also , in moving from this latter to the non - metastable region @xmath324 with @xmath211 , another discontinuous change of dynamic exponents occurs . in the absence of activation barriers",
    "now these former become diffusive [ figs.[five](b ) and [ eight](a ) ] whilst the relaxation time of finite systems remains bounded even at @xmath139 .",
    "this situation is highly reminiscent of that of the glauber dynamics studied in ref.@xcite where the sudden emergence of metastable states under a small @xmath23 also changes these exponents from diffusive to nearly ballistic .",
    "when it comes to sectors _ ( f ) _ and _ ( g ) _ the four - fold periodicity of the ground state mentioned in sec.ii left us with few sizes to consider in eq.([normalization ] ) , thus restricting our ability to extrapolate dynamic exponents .",
    "however for @xmath325 , just where the activation barriers of these sectors coincide ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) , surprisingly the normalized gaps become independent of the system size in the arrhenius regime [ inset of fig.[six](b ) ] .",
    "clearly , this suggests an exponential relaxation to equilibrium through time scales @xmath326 that would persist up to the thermodynamic limit . in turn",
    ", this would be consistent with the small exponents preliminarily obtained for other coupling ratios in these sectors , but that is an issue requiring further investigation .",
    "similarly , the study of sector _ ( h ) _ remains quite open given the convergence difficulties encountered in larger chains as temperature is decreased .",
    "nonetheless , _ all _ sectors indicate that the amplitudes involved in eq.([normalization ] ) possibly stand for piecewise - universal quantities . except at @xmath327 , where the original transition rates get discontinuous in the limit of @xmath14 , this",
    "is evidenced by the common saturation values of normalized gaps observed throughout figs.[one ] , [ three ] , [ four](a ) , [ five](a ) , [ six](a ) , [ six](b ) , and [ seven ] . as with dynamic exponents , those values",
    "were extrapolated to their thermodynamic limit in sectors _ ( a ) _ to _ ( e ) _ as well as in the non - metastable region [ eq.([extrapol ] ) and fig.[eight](b ) ] .    in common to a variety of finite - size scaling studies ( see e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) , ultimately small sized systems have been analyzed .",
    "often , as is the case here , the dimensionality of the operators involved ( transfer matrices , liouvillians , quantum hamiltonians ) grows exponentially with the system size thus severely limiting the manageable length scales , even for optimized algorithms . in an attempt to avoid those limitations we also considered the scaling of relaxation times in larger chains via monte carlo simulations",
    "however , due to the arrhenius barriers the difficulties introduced by small temperatures in such simulations are by far more restrictive than those associated to the system size ( recall that @xmath328 ) .",
    "in fact , starting from a disordered phase and quenching down to @xmath329 within the range of @xmath330 , it turned out that a significant fraction of the evolutions considered gets stuck in the typical metastable states of table  [ tab2 ] , even at large times .    finally , and with regard to a possible extension of this study , it would be interesting to derive the activation barriers @xmath132 quoted in that latter table directly from the evolution operator @xmath331 constructed in sec.iia .",
    "however irrespective of the sector considered , note that for @xmath14 the leading - order of its diagonal terms [ eq.([diagonal ] ) ] is different from that of their non - diagonal counterparts [ eqs.([s - pairing ] ) and([s - diffusion ] ) ] .",
    "thereby , the identification of an overall arrhenius factor in the low - temperature limit of @xmath331 is not evident in the kink representation .",
    "but in view of the universal amplitudes obtained above , one can further ask whether there might be a uniform spin rotation @xmath332 around a sector dependent axis such that @xmath333 , for some sector - wise but constant operator @xmath334 .",
    "that would not only single out activation barriers but would also allow computational access to the strict limit of @xmath14 via the low - lying eigenvalues of @xmath334 . further work along that line",
    "is under consideration .",

    "as schematized in table  [ tab2 ] , these metastable ( m ) structures are characterized by the restrictions imposed on the number of consecutive kinks ( @xmath335 ) and vacancies ( @xmath336 ) scattered throughout the chain . in turn , for each coupling sector these constraints affect the rate at which these configurations proliferate with the system size . in order to evaluate such specific rates , in what follows we will construct a set of recursive relations for the number @xmath337 of those states on chains of generic length @xmath17 . to ease the analysis , open boundary conditions ( obc ) will be assumed throughout .",
    "below , we address each case in turn .    0.25 cm _",
    "( a)_. since for this sector @xmath338 and @xmath339 , it is helpful to consider the relation between the quantities @xmath340 and @xmath341 defined as the number of m - configurations of length @xmath17 having respectively 1 or 0 as kink occupations on their first site . clearly , under obc these latter quantities must then be recursively related as @xmath342 therefore , either of these quantities as well as the total number @xmath343 of m - states follow a fibonacci recursion @xmath344 , from which an exponential growth @xmath345 with golden mean @xmath346 is obtained for large sizes ( this growth also coincides with that of the ground state degeneracy at @xmath347 @xcite ) .    0.25 cm _",
    "( b)_. in addition to the kink restrictions of the previous case , here there is also a ban on sequence parts of the form @xmath162 as indicated in table  [ tab2 ] . to take into account that further constraint it is now convenient to introduce the number @xmath348 of m - sequences of length @xmath17 having @xmath349 and @xmath350 as their first and second characters respectively ( @xmath351 0 or 1 ) . under obc",
    "it is then a simple matter to check that these quantities must be related as      while clearly @xmath353 . in eq.([b - b ] ) , @xmath354 cancels out just all extra sequences from @xmath355 which would not form part of @xmath356 .",
    "thereby , it can be readily verified that all @xmath357 s , along with the total number of m - states , i.e. @xmath358 , will then follow the recurrence @xmath359 the general solution of this latter @xcite is associated to the roots of the polynomial @xmath360 , thus for long chains , where the largest root dominates , the m - configurations of this sector finally turn out to grow as @xmath166",
    ".    0.25 cm _",
    "( c)_. further to @xmath361 , in this coupling sector every kink must appear separated by at least two vacancies , i.e. @xmath362 , so now there are even more reductions in the number of m - states . on considering for instance the @xmath341 and",
    "@xmath340 quantities referred to in case _ ( a ) _ , it is clear that under obc here these should verify @xmath363 from where the total number of m - configurations is obtained recursively as @xmath364 thus , for @xmath365 the largest root of the associated polynomial @xmath366 implies that @xmath367 .    0.25 cm _ ( d)_. in this case not only @xmath368 and @xmath338 , but also there may be consecutive kinks now appearing in groups of @xmath369 . to evaluate the proliferation of the corresponding m - states",
    "it is convenient to reintroduce here the @xmath348 quantities referred to in case _",
    "( b)_. for these latter , we readily obtain the recursive relations @xmath370 ( obc throughout ) , evidently now with @xmath371 as there can be no isolated vacancies . thus , after a small amount of algebra it turns out that the total number of m - configurations as well as all @xmath372 satisfy the recursive form @xmath373 from where the golden mean is recovered in the largest root of the associated polynomial @xmath374 . hence , analogously to sector _",
    "( a ) _ , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath375 proliferates as @xmath164 .    0.25 cm _",
    "( e)_. as it was referred to in table  [ tab2 ] for this coupling regime @xmath376 and @xmath368 .",
    "thus , resorting back to the @xmath377 quantities considered above we readily find that in this sector these must be related as @xmath378 whereas @xmath379 , as neither vacancies nor kinks may appear isolated in this case ( obc assumed ) .",
    "thereby , it can be checked that the total number of m - states is given recursively by @xmath380 from the largest root of the polynomial @xmath381 linked to this recurrence , it then follows that for large sizes @xmath337 finally grows as @xmath194 .    0.25 cm _",
    "( f)_. in this sector kinks and vacancy constraints are respectively specified by @xmath382 , and @xmath383 .",
    "therefore , in terms of the @xmath357-quantities introduced above this means that their recursion relations should now read @xmath384 while clearly @xmath385 .",
    "hence , after simple substitutions it is found that each of these @xmath357 s , and correspondingly the total number of m - states , all follow the recursive form @xmath386 which for large sizes is taken over by the largest root of the polynomial @xmath387 .",
    "thereby , it turns out that for this coupling regime @xmath337 grows only as fast as @xmath388 .    0.25 cm _",
    "( g)_. following table  [ tab2 ] , in this coupling regime @xmath382 ( as before ) , but now @xmath389 .",
    "in addition , there is also the constraint impeding the appearance of sequence parts of the form @xmath207 hence , assuming as usual obc , the four @xmath357-quantities of this case must be linked recursively as      due to the above restriction , and on par with case _",
    "( b ) _ , here @xmath391 appears subtracting unwanted sequences which otherwise would overestimate @xmath392 in eq.([g - a ] ) .",
    "it is then a straightforward matter to verify that all of the above @xmath357 s ( and therefore also @xmath337 ) , ought to comply with the relation @xmath393 so , the characteristic polynomial associated to this latter recurrence is @xmath394 , from where it follows that at large sizes @xmath337 should proliferate as @xmath209",
    ".    0.25 cm _",
    "( h)_. finally , in this sector kinks and vacancy restrictions remain as in the previous case except that the ban on the sequences referred to above is now lifted .",
    "thus , recursions ( [ g ] ) still hold provided eq.([g - a ] ) is modified as @xmath395 i.e. the cancellation of sequences contained in @xmath396 is no longer required here .",
    "after that modification it can be readily checked that the recursions arising in this coupling regime are all of the form @xmath397 from the largest root of @xmath398 , we thus find that in the limit of large @xmath17 here @xmath337 grows as @xmath208 .      for reviews ,",
