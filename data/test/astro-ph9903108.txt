    "its column density ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) is one of the highest observed in the x  ray sources of this region of sky , suggesting a distance similar or even greater than the galactic center . to power the observed luminosity @xmath4 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 accretion onto a compact object",
    "is clearly required .",
    "contrary to many other x  ray binaries in the galactic center region that are characterized by transient activity , 1e  1743.12843 is a persistent source , that has been detected in all the observations carried out up to now ( watson et al .",

    "1996 ) .    we have recently obtained a long pointing centered on 1e  1743.12843 in the context of our survey of the galactic center region with the @xmath0 satellite ( sidoli et al .",
    "in addition , several other @xmath0 and @xmath1 serendipitous observations of this source are available , spanning the years from 1993 to 1998 .",
    "in table 1 we summarize the @xmath0 and @xmath1 observations of 1e  1743.12843 used in this work .",
    "in addition to the 70.4 ks long pointing obtained on april 13 - 15 , 1998 , for which 1e  1743.12843 was the main target ( s4 ) , four other @xmath0 observations are available : one pointed on the galactic center ( sgra west , @xmath7100 ks ) and three shorter ones pointed at different locations along the galactic plane in order to map the sgr b2 molecular cloud . + our analysis of the @xmath0 observations",
    "is based on data obtained with the mecs instrument ( boella et al .",
    "the mecs instrument consists of three position - sensitive gas - scintillation proportional counters providing images in the 1.310 kev energy range within a field of view of 56 diameter , and with an angular resolution of @xmath41 ( 50% power radius of @xmath775  at 6 kev , on - axis ) .",
    "the mecs energy resolution is @xmath78.5@xmath8% fwhm . after the failure of mecs1 in may 1997 ,",
    "only two units are available .",
    "the @xmath1 satellite ( tanaka , inoue & holt 1994 ) observed the region of sky containing 1e  1743.12843 several times .",
    "@xmath1 provides simultaneous data in four coaligned telescopes , equipped with two solid state detectors ( sis ) and two gas scintillation proportional counters ( gis ) .",
    "however , since in most of these observations 1e  1743.12843 lies at large off - axis angles , only the gis instruments , with a larger field of view ( 44 diameter ) , provide useful data .",
    "1e  1743.12843 was within the sis field of view only in the observation performed on september 19 , 1995 .",
    "these data were analyzed to search for the presence of spectral features , exploiting the superior energy resolution of the ccd based detectors ( fwhm @xmath72% at 6 kev ) .    the @xmath0 image centered on 1e  1743.12843 , obtained with the mecs in april 1998 ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ mecsimage ] .",
    "it is evident that 1e  1743.12843 lies in a region of diffuse emission , associated both with the molecular cloud sgrb2 and with sgra ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; sidoli et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the fainter source @xmath713 to the se of 1e  1743.12843 is sax  j1747.02853 , a transient low mass x ",
    "ray binary ( sidoli et al .",
    "+ the coordinates of 1e  1743.12843 derived with the mecs are @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000 ) with an uncertainty of @xmath71. these are fully consistent with those determined with the einstein observatory ( watson et al .",
    "1981 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for each observation and detector , we searched for periodic modulations in the x  ray flux of the source using a fourier analysis . in order to increase the search sensitivity we merged the data from contiguous observations : a1 , a2 , a3 and a4 as well as a6 and a7 . for each data set , after converting the arrival times to the solar system barycenter , we accumulated light curves binned at 5ms and calculated a single power spectrum , correcting for the background , over the whole observation following the method outlined by israel & stella ( 1996 ) .",
    "no significant periodicity was found in any of the power spectra at a 99% confidence level . in table 2",
    "we report the corresponding upper limits on the source pulsed fraction for selected values of the period .",
    "we also looked for the presence of x - ray bursts , by examining the light curves binned at time resolutions of a few seconds , but no bursts were found . though it is difficult to derive quantitative upper limits for such a kind of analysis , we note that a typical type  i x  ray burst with a peak luminosity close to the eddington limit would have produced in 1e  1743.12843 an easily detectable count rate increase of a factor of a few hundreds .",
    "with the lack of an optical identification , which is hampered by the high interstellar absorption and the relatively large error region ( rosat did not detect this source due to the high column density , see ) , we must discuss the nature of 1e  1743.12843 only on the basis of its x  ray properties .",
    "the first important thing to consider is the high column density derived from the spectral fittings .",
    "we notice that the x - ray source(s ) at the position of the galactic center , at an angular distance of only @xmath716 from 1e  1743.12843 , has n@xmath117@xmath1210@xmath13 @xmath3 ( sidoli et al .",
    "also the nearby ( @xmath713 ) lmxrb sax  j1747.02853 has a value of n@xmath118@xmath1210@xmath13 @xmath3 .",
    "a likely distance of the order of 10 kpc is indicated by its persistent flux as well as by the peak luminosity during a type  i burst ( sidoli et al .",
    "it is therefore very likely that also 1e  1743.12843 is at a distance of at least several kiloparsecs , and is possibly close to ( or even beyond ) the galactic center .",
    "the resulting luminosity of @xmath72@xmath1210@xmath14@xmath12d@xmath15 erg s@xmath6 immediately rules out models involving coronal or wind emission from normal stars , and strongly favours the presence of an accreting compact object .",
    "kawai et al .",
    "( 1988 ) suggested that 1e  1743.12843 could be a massive binary system similar to vela x-1 or gx301 - 2 , and that part of the measured absorption could be intrinsic .",
    "instead , we believe that the absence of coherent pulsations ( and/or eclipses ) and the relatively soft spectrum are in favour of a low mass x - ray binary .",
    "the observed variability is also compatible with such an interpretation .",
    "we note in passing the striking similarity of the variability pattern observed in september 1994 and 1995 and in april 1998 ( see the light curves a5 and a8 of fig .  [ ascalc ] and s5 of fig .  [ saxlc ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the available data are too sparse to establish a possible orbital periodicity as the cause of the observed variability pattern .",
    "+ most lmxrb containing neutron stars are characterized by the occurrence of type  i x  ray bursts . up to now",
    "no bursts have been detected from 1e  1743.12843 despite it being active and repeatedly observed for over 20 years .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 observations reported here provide a total effective exposure of 656 ks , in which no bursts have been detected from 1e  1743.12843 .",
    "many other observations of this region of sky obtained in recent years with imaging detectors failed to detect bursts from this source ( for instance the art - p instrument collected 820 ks of data , pavlinsky et al 1994 ) .",
    "if 1e  1743.12843 is indeed a lmxrb , the lack of bursts is remarkable also because the most likely luminosity of this source ( 10@xmath1410@xmath16 erg s@xmath6 ) is in the typical range of x  ray bursters .",
    "the lack of bursting activity in lmxrb of higher luminosity is generally ascribed to the stable burning of h and he which occurs at luminosities close to the eddington limit ( fujimoto et al . 1981 ) .",
    "such a high luminosity would require that 1e  1743.12843 is at a distance greater than several tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "finally , we can not exclude that 1e  1743.12843 is an extragalactic source seen through the galactic plane , which is similar to the case of grs  1734292 ( ) .",
    "an examination of the maps of the nvss , nrao vla sky survey ( @xcite ) , did not reveal any possible radio counterpart at the position of 1e  1743.12843 with flux at 20 cm greater than @xmath750 mjy .",
    "however , considering the wide range of x  ray to radio flux ratios observed in active galactic nuclei , the lack of a radio counterpart similar to that observed for grs  1734292 does not exclude the possibility of an extragalactic origin for 1e  1743.12843 ."
