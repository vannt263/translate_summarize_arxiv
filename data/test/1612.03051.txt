    "after the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , there have been many experimental studies to investigate different quantum phenomena in a laboratory previously not accessible for study in a controlled environment , such as , quantum phase transition @xcite , quantum collapse of matter wave under attraction @xcite , four - wave mixing of matter waves @xcite , formation of vortex lattice @xcite , interference of matter waves @xcite , josephson tunneling @xcite , anderson localization @xcite etc . the generation and the dynamics of self - bound large quantum waves have drawn much attention lately .",
    "there have been some studies of self - bound matter waves or solitons in one ( 1d ) @xcite or two ( 2d ) @xcite space dimensions",
    ". a ( self - bound ) bright soliton travels at a constant velocity in 1d , due to a cancellation of nonlinear attraction and defocusing forces @xcite .",
    "the collision between two analytic 1d bright solitons is always elastic @xcite with the solitons emerging after collision without a change of velocity and shape .",
    "the 1d soliton has been observed in nonlinear optics @xcite and in bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "however , a two- or three - dimensional ( 3d ) soliton can not be realized for two - body contact attraction alone due to collapse @xcite .",
    "the 1d bec solitons studied experimentally @xcite are really quasi solitons behaving like real solitons at large velocities . at low velocities a deformation of their shapes",
    "is expected upon collision .",
    "there have been a few proposals for creating a self - bound 3d matter - wave state which we term a quantum ball .",
    "some of these proposals involve an engineering of the atomic scattering length using the feshbach resonance technique to generate dynamically stabilized solitons in 2d and 3d @xcite .",
    "others consider extra interactions usually neglected in dilute bec of alkali atoms to create a stationary localized state . in the presence of an additional nonlocal dipolar interaction a 2d bec soliton can be generated @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested by maucher _",
    "_ @xcite that in the case of rydberg atoms , off - resonant dressing to rydberg nd states can provide a nonlocal long - range attraction which can form a quantum ball .",
    "the collapse instability can be stopped in this case by a repulsive contact interaction . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that a _ very small _ repulsive three - body interaction in the presence of an attractive two - body contact interaction can generate a stable quantum ball .",
    "the collapse is stopped in this case by the repulsive three - body interaction .",
    "although , some theoretical suggestions for generating a quantum ball , in the presence of a repulsive core in the two - body atomic interaction , seem viable @xcite , so far there has not been success in their experimental realization . nevertheless , there are questions about the dynamics of a quantum ball which are very intriguing . the study of the dynamics of a quantum elementary particle like an electron to determine simultaneously its position and velocity is doomed to failure due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation . on the other hand , for a quantum ball",
    "the uncertainty relation is not of concern due to its large mass and it can be traced like a classical object by its position and velocity at each instant . as the quantum ball is self bound it can move like a classical ball obeying newton s first law of motion .",
    "however , very little is known about the interaction dynamics of two quantum balls and that of a quantum ball with other objects and we address these questions in this paper .",
    "we consider the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation with the inclusion of a three - body interaction for the study of statics and dynamics of a quantum ball .",
    "the quantum balls are bound by an attractive two - body contact interaction in the presence of a repulsive three - body contact interaction .",
    "we use the realistic parameters of @xmath0li atoms , in this study , with a negative scattering length corresponding to two - body attraction @xcite .",
    "the effect of atom loss due to three - body recombination is included in the study of dynamics .",
    "the three body loss rate is not accurately known for this system @xcite for the parameter domain used in this study .",
    "we have chosen three - body loss rates that ensure our system does not decay significantly during our dynamical simulations .",
    "it is expected that the dynamics of quantum balls will be independent of the details of the mechanism responsible for self binding and we do not believe that the results obtained here are so peculiar as to have no general validity .",
    "in fact , a preliminary study revealed similar dynamics for quantum balls made of dipolar atoms @xcite .",
    "a stationary quantum ball can be formed for the two - body attraction above a critical value in the 3d gp equation for any finite three - body repulsion .",
    "the statical properties of the quantum ball are studied using a variational analysis and a numerical solution of the 3d gp equation .",
    "the variational and numerical results are found to be in good agreement with each other .",
    "the stability of the quantum ball is established numerically under a small perturbation introduced by changing the three - body interaction by a small amount , while the quantum ball is found to execute sustained breathing oscillation .",
    "a quantum ball can move freely without deformation along any direction with a constant velocity .",
    "we study the frontal and angular collisions between two quantum balls .",
    "only the collision between two integrable 1d solitons is truly elastic @xcite . as the dimensionality of the soliton",
    "is increased such collision is expected to become inelastic with loss of energy in 2d and 3d . in the present numerical simulation of frontal collision between two quantum balls , at sufficiently large velocities",
    "the collision is found to be quasi elastic when the two quantum balls emerge after collision with practically no deformation and without any change of velocities .",
    "unlike classical balls , obeying the newton s laws , there is no change in the directions of motion of the quantum balls after collision .",
    "however , upon impact with a rigid impenetrable plane the quantum ball bounces like a classical elastic ball obeying the usual laws of reflection . at small velocities the collision between two quantum balls is inelastic and the quantum balls form a single bound entity in an excited state executing breathing oscillation , which we call a quantum - ball breather .",

    "<S> we study the statics and dynamics of a stable , mobile , three - dimensional matter - wave spherical quantum ball created in the presence of an attractive two - body and a _ very small _ repulsive three - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum ball can propagate with a constant velocity in any direction in free space and its stability under a small perturbation is established numerically and variationally . in frontal head - on and angular collisions at large velocities two quantum balls behave like quantum solitons . </S>",
    "<S> such collision is found to be quasi elastic and the quantum balls emerge after collision without any change of direction of motion and velocity and with practically no deformation in shape . when reflected by a hard impenetrable plane , the quantum ball bounces off like a wave obeying the law of reflection without any change of shape or speed . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a collision at small velocities two quantum balls coalesce to form a larger ball which we call a quantum - ball breather . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the similarity and difference between the collision of two quantum and classical balls . </S>",
    "<S> the present study is based on an analytic variational approximation and a full numerical solution of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation using the parameters of @xmath0li atoms . </S>"
