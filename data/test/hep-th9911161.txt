    "understanding the physics of spacetime singularities is a challenge for any complete theory of quantum gravity .",
    "it has been shown that string theory resolves certain seeming singularities , such as orbifolds  @xcite , flops  @xcite , and conifolds  @xcite , in the sense that their physics is completely nonsingular .",
    "on the other hand , it has also been argued that certain singularities should not be resolved , but rather must be disallowed configurations  in particular , negative mass schwarzschild , which would correspond to an instability of the vacuum  @xcite .",
    "also , in the study of perturbations of the ads / cft duality various singular spacetimes have been encountered , and at least some of these must be unphysical in the same sense as negative mass schwarzschild . a more general understanding of singularities in string theory is thus an important goal .",
    "in this paper we study a naked singularity of a particular type  @xcite , which has been dubbed the _",
    "repulson_. a variety of brane configurations in string theory appear to give rise to such a singularity . however , we will argue that this is not the case .",
    "rather , as the name might suggest , the constituent branes effectively repel one another ( in spite of supersymmetry ) , forming in the end a nonsingular shell .",
    "our interest in this singularity arose from a search for new examples of gauge / gravity duality .",
    "in particular , the brane configurations that give rise to the repulson singularity have on their world - volumes pure @xmath3 , @xmath4 gauge theory ( or the equivalent in other dimensions ) , as opposed to the usual pure @xmath3 , @xmath5 , or @xmath3 , @xmath4 with hypermultiplets .",
    "we do not precisely find such a duality , in the sense of using supergravity to calculate properties of the strongly coupled gauge theory , but we do find a striking parallel between the moduli space of the large-@xmath0 @xmath6 gauge theory and the fate that we have deduced for the singularity .",
    "we also find some clues which allow us to guess at aspects of a possible dual .    in section  2",
    "we describe the repulson singularity and the various brane configurations where it arises . in section  3",
    "we deduce the specific physical mechanism by which it is removed . in section  4",
    "we relate this to behavior of yang ",
    "mills theory with eight supersymmetries .",
    "we do not find a duality , in the sense of being able to use supergravity to calculate in the strongly coupled gauge theory , but we find a striking parallel between the physical picture deduced in section  3 and the large-@xmath0 seiberg  witten theory .",
    "we point out some features suggestive of a dual theory , and remark upon the case of finite temperature . in section  5",
    "we develop two of the dual versions , in terms of bent ns5-branes , and wrapped / fractional d - branes .",
    "section  6 offers brief conclusions , and suggestions for future directions .",
    "let us consider first the oft - discussed d1d5 system , @xmath7 here @xmath8 run over the 05-directions tangent to all the branes , @xmath9 runs over the 1234-directions transverse to all branes , and @xmath10 runs over the 6789-directions of a @xmath11 , tangent to the d5-branes and transverse to the d1-branes .",
    "we have defined @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the volume of the @xmath11 .",
    "this configuration leaves 8 unbroken supersymmetries , all of which transform as @xmath15 under the @xmath16 that acts on @xmath17 . at the horizon , @xmath18 ,",
    "the geometry approaches ads@xmath19 , giving rise to an ads / cft duality  @xcite .",
    "the tension of the effective string in 6 dimensions is @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "now imagine taking @xmath23 , but keeping the _ same _ unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "this is not the same as replacing the d1-branes with anti - d1-branes , which would leave unbroken @xmath24 supersymmetries instead .",
    "rather , the solution  ( [ 15sol ] ) is simply continued to @xmath23 , so that @xmath25 .",
    "this radically changes the geometry : the radius @xmath26 is now a naked singularity  @xcite , and the region @xmath27 is unphysical .",
    "also , the tension  ( [ tension ] ) can vanish and apparently even become negative .    in spite of these odd properties",
    ", the case @xmath23 can be realized physically . to do this , replace the @xmath11 with a k3 , with @xmath28 d5-branes wrapped on the k3 .",
    "then as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the coupling of the d5-brane to the curvature induces a d1-brane charge @xmath29 . for @xmath30 sufficiently large the solution  ( [ 15sol ] ) with @xmath29 ( and with @xmath31 replaced by the metric of a k3 of volume @xmath14 )",
    "would be expected to be a good description of the geometry .",
    "the low energy theory on the branes is pure supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills with eight supersymmetries  @xcite , in @xmath32 dimensions",
    ". one can understand this from the general result that the number of hypermultiplets minus vector multiplets is @xmath33 , from 1 - 5 strings .",
    "continuing to @xmath29 gives @xmath34 , corresponding to the @xmath35 adjoint without hypermultiplets .",
    ", we can also study the case of @xmath6 with @xmath36 fundamental flavours .",
    "it is amusing to note that the case @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 , which means that @xmath39 and the supergravity solution simplifies greatly .",
    "this is pertinent for the four - dimensional case which is superconformal . ]    by dualities one can find many other brane configurations with singularities of the same sort , and with the same low energy gauge theory in @xmath40 dimensions .",
    "our interest in this solution arose from the search for supergravity duals to these gauge theories , and we will return to this point in section  4 . by @xmath41-dualities on the noncompact directions one obtains solutions with d@xmath42 and d@xmath43 charge , for @xmath42 = 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 . by @xmath41-dualities on the whole k3",
    "one can replace the d@xmath43-branes wrapped on the k3 with d@xmath44-branes wrapped on a nontrivial @xmath45 with self - intersection number @xmath46 .",
    "this latter realization can also be obtained as follows .",
    "consider @xmath0 d3-branes at a @xmath47 orbifold singularity  @xcite .",
    "the low energy gauge theory is @xmath48 with hypermultiplets in the @xmath49 . by going along the coulomb branch in the direction diag@xmath50 one",
    "gives masses to all the @xmath51 hypermultiplets .",
    "this corresponds to separating the branes along the singularity into two clumps of @xmath0 half - branes , which are secretly  @xcite d5-branes wrapped on the collapsed @xmath45 ( the half d3-brane charge comes from the @xmath52 @xmath53-field at the orbifold point ) .",
    "wrapped d5-branes plus @xmath0 d3-branes , producing gauge group @xmath54 with bifundamental hypermultiplets .",
    "the focus of these papers is @xmath55 , whereas ours is the opposite limit @xmath56 . ]",
    "a @xmath41-duality on this brane - wrapped ale space results in another dual realization , this time involving a pair of ns5-branes with @xmath0 d@xmath57-branes stretched between them  @xcite .",
    "finally , by an @xmath58-duality the @xmath59 case can be related to the heterotic string on @xmath11 , with @xmath0 bps winding strings having @xmath60 .",
    "these are the strings which become massless non - abelian gauge bosons at special points in moduli space , a fact that will play an important role in the next section .",
    "similarly , the @xmath61 case @xmath58-dualizes  @xcite to a combination of the kaluza  klein monopole and the h - monopole  @xcite which is equivalent  @xcite to the @xmath62 magnetic black hole in four dimensions . in this heterotic form , these solutions have previously been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the nature of the singularity was studied in ref .",
    "it was shown that massive particles coupled to the einstein metric feel an infinite repulsive potential at the singularity , hence the name _",
    "repulson_. if instead one takes as probes the same kind of d5-brane as forms the geometry , then by the usual supersymmetry argument the potential should vanish . hence there should be no obstruction to building this geometry from a collection of such d5-branes .",
    "however , we will find in the next section that this argument fails for a reason specific to the repulson geometry , so that in fact the geometry is smoothed out in a certain way , and the singularity removed .",
    "for @xmath23 the gauge theory has no higgs branch ( which would correspond to one or more bound states ) , and so for @xmath63 infrared fluctuations might prevent the existence of a stable object .",
    "for this reason we will focus on the d2-d6 example in this section , @xmath64 now @xmath8 run over the 045-directions tangent to all the branes , @xmath9 runs over the 123-directions transverse to all branes , @xmath65 is the metric of a k3 surface of unit volume , and @xmath66 we have inserted @xmath67 .",
    "the bps bound for general charges is @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "a d6-brane probe ( wrapped on the k3 ) has a well - defined moduli space . to understand better the physics of the repulson geometry , consider the effective action of such a probe , @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the projection of the world - volume onto the six noncompact dimensions and @xmath73 is the induced metric .",
    "we have written this down on physical grounds .",
    "the first term is the dirac action with the position - dependence of the tension  ( [ tension2 ] ) taken into account ; in particular , @xmath74 .",
    "the second and third terms are the couplings of the probe charges @xmath75 to the background .",
    "note that to derive this action from the full d6-brane action requires two curvature - squared terms .",
    "one appears in the wz action and accounts for the induced d2 charge  @xcite .",
    "the other appears in the dirac action and produces the @xmath76 term in the tension  @xcite .    expanding the action  ( [ probe ] ) in powers of the transverse velocity gives the lagrangian density @xmath77 the position - dependent potential terms cancel as expected for a supersymmetric system , leaving the constant potential @xmath78 and a nontrivial metric on moduli space as expected with eight supersymmetries .",
    "the metric is proportional to @xmath79 we assume that @xmath80 , so that the metric at infinity ( and the membrane tension ) are positive .",
    "however , as @xmath81 decreases the metric eventually becomes negative , and this occurs at a radius @xmath82 which is strictly greater than the radius @xmath83 of the repulson singularity .    to understand what is happening , note that this kinetic term comes entirely from the dirac term in the action  ( [ probe ] ) , and that what is vanishing is the factor @xmath84 in the probe tension .",
    "this occurs when @xmath85 , and so before the singularity ( where @xmath86 goes to 0 ) .",
    "the negative tension at @xmath87 is clearly unphysical . to see how we should interpret it ,",
    "recall that the probe is dual to a heterotic winding string , and the vanishing of the tension corresponds to the vanishing of the winding string mass at a point of enhanced gauge symmetry .",
    "it is well - known that the latter can be interpreted as the ordinary higgs mechanism . in the higgs mechanism",
    "the mass is related to the expectation value by @xmath88 note the absolute value .    therefore we should take ( minus ) the absolute value in the first term of the action  ( [ probe ] ) and ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "now the metric is positive but another problem appears : the potential no longer cancels , but rises as @xmath81 decreases below @xmath89 .",
    "this means that we can not move the probe to @xmath90 in a supersymmetric way , and so contradicts the assumption that we can build the repulson geometry by bringing together a succession of wrapped d6-branes .",
    "thus we are led to a very different picture : the @xmath0 d6-branes all live on the sphere at @xmath91 .",
    "even if we try to build the geometry by starting with coincident d6-branes at @xmath92 , where @xmath93 , and then increasing the coupling , we would expect the system to expand as @xmath94 is increased .",
    "we will see an interesting parallel to this behavior in the gauge theory discussion of the next section .    with this picture , the geometry  ( [ 26sol ] ) is correct only down to @xmath95 .",
    "since the sources are all at this radius , the geometry should be flat in the interior @xmath96 : in the interior by continuity of the metric .",
    "c. vafa suggests that there may be an ` overshoot , ' by analogy with ref .",
    "@xmath97^{-1/2 } \\eta_{\\mu\\nu } dx^\\mu dx^\\nu + [ z_2(r_{\\rm e } ) z_6(r_{\\rm e})]^{1/2 } dx^i dx^i + v_*^{1/2 } ds^2_{\\rm k3 } \\",

    "\\label{26flat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the non - zero potential that appeared in the proof - by - contradiction is not a real feature , because the geometry  ( [ 26sol ] ) is no longer relevant for @xmath90 . indeed , it is difficult to see how such a potential could be consistent with supersymmetry .",
    "now , however , we seem to have another contradiction",
    ". there seems to be no obstacle to the probe moving into the flat region  ( [ 26flat ] ) , contradicting the conclusion that the d6-branes are fixed at @xmath89 . to see the obstacle",
    "we must look more deeply .",
    "note that in the interior region the k3 volume takes the constant value @xmath98 , meaning that the probe is a tensionless membrane .",
    "a tensionless membrane sounds even more exotic than a tensionless string , but in fact ( as in other examples ) it is actually prosaic : it is best interpreted as a composite in an effective field theory . note that the ratios @xmath99 are equal .",
    "this means that a wrapped d4-brane is a massless particle whenever the wrapped d6-brane is tensionless .",
    "in fact , it is a non - abelian gauge boson , which together with an r  r vector and a wrapped anti - d4-brane form an enhanced @xmath100 gauge symmetry .",
    "that is , in the interior geometry there is an unbroken @xmath100 gauge symmetry in six dimensions .",
    "for this reason we refer to this as the enhanon geometry , and the radius @xmath101 as the enhanon radius .",
    "now , a two - dimensional object in six dimensions would be obtained by lifting a point object in four , and so a magnetic monopole naturally suggests itself .",
    "indeed , the wrapped d4-brane is a source of a 2-form r ",
    "r field strength in six dimensions , and the wrapped d6-brane is the source of the dual 4-form field strength .",
    "the mass of a monopole is proportional to the mass of the corresponding @xmath102 boson , so they vanish together when @xmath103 . since the size of the monopole is inverse to the mass of the @xmath102 boson , there is no sense in which a probe can be localized within the enhanon radius .",
    "for this same reason the probe begins to expand as it approaches @xmath89 , so it appears that it will essentially melt smoothly into the shell of @xmath0 monopoles at @xmath89 .",
    "this has the effect that junction between the exterior geometry  ( [ 26sol ] ) and the interior geometry  ( [ 26flat ] ) is smoothed .",
    "we can estimate this smoothing effect as follows .",
    "the mass of a wrapped d - brane is @xmath104 .",
    "the probe will cease to be effectively pointlike when @xmath105 leading to @xmath106 thus we have a consistent picture in which the repulson is replaced by a smooth geometry .",
    "the same principle holds for other values of @xmath42 .",
    "the enhanon locus is @xmath107 , whose interior is @xmath108-dimensional . for even @xmath42 the theory in the interior",
    "has an @xmath100 gauge symmetry , while for odd @xmath42 there is an @xmath109 ( 2,0 ) theory .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that a k3 with volume @xmath98 is @xmath41-dual to a k3 at an @xmath109 singularity .",
    "the details of the smoothing depend on @xmath42 , and for @xmath110 it is likely that the ir fluctuations must be considered .",
    "note that our result for the lagrangian density ( [ lag ] ) depends only on three moduli space coordinates , @xmath111 , or @xmath112 in polar coordinates . for a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theory with eight supercharges ,",
    "the moduli space metric must be hyperkhler  @xcite .",
    "a minimum requirement for this is of course that it has four coordinates , and so we must find an extra modulus . on the probe , there is an extra @xmath113 gauge potential @xmath114 , corresponding to the overall centre of mass degree of freedom .",
    "we may exchange this for a scalar @xmath115 by hodge duality in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional world - volume .",
    "this is of course a feature specific to the @xmath116 case .    to get the coupling for this extra modulus correct",
    ", we should augment the probe computation of the previous section to include @xmath114 .",
    "the dirac action is modified by an extra term in the determinant : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the field strength of @xmath114 .",
    "furthermore , in the presence of @xmath118 , there is a coupling @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the magnetic potential produced by the d6-brane charge : @xmath121 . adapting the procedures of refs .",
    "@xcite , we can introduce an auxiliary vector field @xmath122 , replacing @xmath123 by @xmath124 in the dirac action , and adding the term @xmath125 overall . treating @xmath122 as a lagrange multiplier",
    ", the path integral over @xmath122 will give the action involving @xmath126 as before .",
    "alternatively , we may treat @xmath118 as a lagrange multiplier , and integrating it out enforces @xmath127 here , @xmath128 are the components of the pullback of @xmath129 to the probe s world - volume .",
    "the solution to the constraint above is @xmath130 where the scalar @xmath115 is our fourth modulus .",
    "we may now replace @xmath122 by @xmath131 in the action , and the static gauge computation gives for the kinetic term : @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134",
    "one of the goals of this work is to obtain a useful dual description of the physics of strongly coupled @xmath6 gauge theory ( with eight supercharges and no hypermultiplets ) at large-@xmath0 .",
    "this is a necessarily complex undertaking , as there are at least four different theories which play important roles here , and so in the spirit of ref .",

    "otherwise , we will have only supergravity phases .",
    "the interesting case is therefore @xmath167 , so that we have at least one region where the gauge theory is weakly coupled .",
    "we will take @xmath168 for the remainder of this subsection .    in satisfying this condition",
    ", we find that the supergravity geometry is strongly curved at the enhanon radius .",
    "since the supergravity fields do not evolve inside the enhanon , this is the maximum curvature . at the enhanon radius",
    ", we can also inspect the dilaton ; it is @xmath169 from the equation ( [ dilp ] ) , we find that the dilaton increases monotonically with @xmath170 .",
    "it becomes of order one at @xmath171 at radii @xmath172 , we will need to use the @xmath58-dual supergravity description .",
    "since at these radii the effect of @xmath145 is very small , by comparison to the effect of @xmath144 , we are in fact matching on to the picture obtained by  @xcite for the d@xmath43-branes alone ; the physics involving the k3 is essentially irrelevant .",
    "we now need to find the degrees of freedom best suited to describing the physics for @xmath173 .",
    "as @xmath170 decreases from @xmath174 , the curvature of the @xmath175 supergravity geometry will become stronger ; it becomes of order unity at @xmath176 at this place , the @xmath177-dimensional gauge theory will take over .",
    "we can see this by starting with its dimensionless t hooft coupling as a function of gauge theory energy @xmath178 @xmath179 now , in order to relate @xmath178 to @xmath170 we need an ir / uv relation for the strings stretched between the probe brane and the source branes .",
    "since the source branes are distributed on a s@xmath180 shell at the enhanon radius , the relation is @xmath181 , where @xmath182 encodes which brane on the shell the stretched string attaches to .",
    "in addition , we have the condition on the control parameter @xmath183 , so that @xmath184 and thus the size of the shell is not important .",
    "so the ir / uv relation is to good accuracy @xmath185 .",
    "therefore we see that the dimensionless t hooft coupling of the @xmath177-dimensional gauge theory is order one at @xmath186 .",
    "it decreases for smaller @xmath170 .",
    "we also have the induced lower - dimensional gauge theory with dimensionless coupling @xmath187 the crossover between the @xmath177- and @xmath57-dimensional gauge theories is clearly at @xmath188 . at lower energies",
    "_ i.e. _  smaller @xmath170 , the @xmath57-dimensional gauge theory takes over .",
    "however , this time its dimensionless t hooft coupling increases as @xmath170 decreases , _",
    "i.e. _ exhibits the opposite behavior to the @xmath177-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "this is consistent with the physics of the @xmath5 supersymmetric systems studied in  @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless t hooft coupling of the @xmath57-dimensional theory becomes strong at @xmath189 let us now recall the enhanon radius , defined by @xmath190 , or @xmath191 . from our previous considerations of a probe in the background of @xmath0 branes , we found that the branes were ( evenly ) distributed on a s@xmath180 shell of this radius .",
    "the energy of a string stretched between any two branes in this shell must therefore fall between @xmath192 the energy at which the @xmath42-dimensional gauge theory becomes strong is then precisely the energy at which the physics of the system is described by some theory whose dynamics includes only the bps strings stretched between the source branes ( and of probe branes so close to the enhanon radius that they too can be thought of as source branes ) .    at the very lowest energies we can simply use the moduli space description of the physics .",
    "the gap that remains in building our phase diagram is an understanding of the physics in the energy range ( [ newrange ] ) .",
    "the curvature is strong there and thus we fail to find a supergravity dual for the strongly coupled @xmath57-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "a further indication of that failure is the explicit appearance of @xmath193 in the metric  ( [ scaledmetric ] ) : in the gauge theory , @xmath193 enters the physics only through the parameter @xmath194 , and therefore should not explicitly appear in a dual description .",
    "so we have a mystery here . a natural suggestion for @xmath61 ( with a suitable generalization involving the @xmath109 theory for @xmath195 )",
    "is that the dual is the ( 5 + 1)-dimensional @xmath100 gauge theory in the @xmath0-monopole sector , where they are just becoming massless .",
    "note that this @xmath100 gauge theory is part of the bulk physics , so what we are conjecturing is that it is the only relevant part and that the supergravity can be omitted .",
    "a weak test is that it give the correct moduli space , and it does .",
    "note also that the enhanon geometry has a natural interpretation in the gauge theory : in the @xmath0-monopole sector the higgs field has a zero of order  @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath196 is essentially zero ( the flat interior ) until rising sharply .",
    "thus a classical monopole solution of large charge might be expected to have its charge distributed in a thin shell . to go further we need a new expansion to describe this system , which becomes weak for @xmath0 large .",
    "it appears that the spacing of the monopoles , of order @xmath197 times the enhanon radius , plays the role of a `` non - commutativity '' parameter , because the sphere has been effectively broken up into @xmath0 domains . in any case",
    ", the mysterious dual description should include the dynamics of these stretched strings at large-@xmath0 .",
    "again , the case @xmath195 needs special treatment . to orient ourselves",

    "both of these facts could be understood if supersymmetry prevented @xmath14 from appearing in the probe metric : one can use @xmath14 as the control parameter to move from weak gauge theory to weak supergravity . on the surface",

    "the things we learned about this original configuration translate into refinements of the dual pictures .",

    "we recover therefore the singularity in the coulomb branch where the gauge coupling diverges , when the separation @xmath303 of the ns5-branes is of order @xmath302 , resulting in an enhanced gauge symmetry on the ns5-branes ( 5 + 1)-dimensional world - volume .",
    "the enhanon is simply the @xmath305 of closest approach of the ns5-branes in the @xmath256 direction .",
    "notice that the probe brane we studied previously is a single stretched d@xmath262-brane moving in @xmath258 in this picture .",

    "one notable result of this paper is a new mechanism that resolves a large class of spacetime singularities in string theory .",

    "one difference from @xcite is that the branes are found not at the singularity in the supergravity metric ; rather , the metric is modified by string / braney phenomena in the manner that we have described .",
