    "it is clear from the described scenario that the understanding of the relevant mechanism(s ) of laser energy absorption leading to the heating of cluster electrons and outer ionization is of great importance for the development of a complete theoretical description .",
    "laser energy absorption by electrons proceeds either through resonances ( linear or nonlinear ) or through non - adiabaticities ( all possible types of collisions ) .",

    "nonlinear resonance ( nlr ) , whose origin lies in the anharmonicity of the cluster potential , turns out to be the dominant collisionless absorption mechanism .",
    "in fact , for very short linearly polarized ( lp ) laser pulses , it was clearly shown @xcite that essentially _ all _ electrons that contribute to outer ionization pass through the nlr , which was unequivocally identified as _ the _ collisionless absorption mechanism in the absence of linear resonance .",

    "the possible importance of nlr was also mentioned or discussed previously @xcite .",

    "we showed that the cluster electrons contributing to efficient absorption and outer ionization undergo nonlinear resonance , meaning that the instantaneous frequency of their motion in a time - dependent , anharmonic , effective potential transiently meets the laser frequency .",
    "nonlinear resonance is the only possible absorption mechanism if the laser pulse is too short for the linear resonance to occur ( or during the early cluster dynamics in longer pulses ) and if electron - ion collisions ( inverse bremsstrahlung ) are negligible . in order to prove the occurrence of nonlinear resonance we used a method to analyze the results obtained from particle - in - cell simulations , namely the mapping of the system of electrons and ions that interact through their mean field onto a system of nonlinear oscillators .",

    "applicable to atoms  fails in the case of finite - size potentials and underestimates the required laser field strength for ionization .",

    "the efficiency of energy absorption from the laser is almost the same for linear and circular polarization , indicating that `` collisions with the cluster boundary '' as an explanation are misleading .",
