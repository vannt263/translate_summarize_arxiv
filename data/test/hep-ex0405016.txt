    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a gauged theory of the strong interactions . exquisitely predictive in the perturbative high - energy regime , at present a description of the physical states is beyond the reach of the theory .",
    "meson spectroscopy allows a more complete understanding of qcd in this non - perturbative realm .",
    "heavy meson spectroscopy provides unique insight into the underlying theory without the additional complications associated with the the lighter ( and more relativistic ) mesons .",
    "heavy mesons have been studied at @xmath1 colliders for nearly 30 years , however , only selective states compatible with the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 beams are produced directly : other states are populated via subsequent hadronic or electromagnetic decays . often , as is the case with the @xmath2(ns )",
    "mesons , the relevant branching ratios are very small .",
    "photon interactions provides a mechanism by which some of these inaccessible mesons are produced directly . in a way that is complementary to @xmath1 interactions ,",
    "@xmath0 interactions produce particles having final states with @xmath3 of + 1 , where @xmath3 is the charge conjugation number .",
    "participating photons can be either virtual or real .",
    "virtual photons are an irreducible description of charged particle beams : all e@xmath4e@xmath5 colliders generate virtual @xmath0 luminosity - in the case of pep - ii or kek - ii the virtual luminosity can rival the e@xmath4e@xmath5 luminosity . an alternate mechanism for producing",
    "@xmath0 luminosity is with real photons .",
    "typically , low energy photons are made to compton - backscatter off of an energetic charged particle beam to produce highly boosted photons . opposing photon beams are kinematically focused and interact to produce real @xmath0 luminosity .",
    "although this production mechanism requires the added complication of introducing a laser and associated optics into the interaction region , the substantial benefits include control over the @xmath0 luminosity profile , polarization and magnitude .",
    "technology advances in optics and lasers have progressed to the point that one could construct a low energy @xmath0 testbed as a proof - of - principle for the nlc , where it would be possible to singly produce the higgs boson ( whereas it must be produced in pairs at e@xmath4e@xmath5 colliders ) .",
    "the potential this offers for doing precision higgs studies is a major driving force behind the impetus for a @xmath0 option at the nlc . for the purposes of this study , however , we restrict our attention to photons with a center of mass energy of 60 gev , which is sufficient for an engineering demonstration .",
    "one possible site for the testbed is the stanford linear collider , where polarized electron beams meet opposing positrons beams at center - of - mass energies up to the mass of the z@xmath6 . in this proceeding",
    "we demonstrate that with suitable choice of laser and optics parameters the resulting @xmath0 luminosity can be made to exceed the virtual @xmath0 luminosity from e@xmath4e@xmath5 colliders .",
    "this luminosity can thus serve as the basis for a physics program at the testbed facility , e.g. , heavy quarkonia studies .",
    "in subsequent sections we compare and contrast real and virtual @xmath0 luminosities and discuss the implications for heavy quark meson spectroscopy .",
    "depending on the energy transfer scale the structure of an otherwise featureless photon can be resolved , resulting in an irreducible hadron and leptonic background that would complicate precision higgs measurements .",
    "hence , a primary goal of a @xmath0 testbed would be to measure the @xmath0 luminosity and compare the result with simulation . in this study",
    "compton - backscattered luminosity was simulated with cain 2.1e @xcite using the laser and beam parameters listed in table [ tab : t1 ] , where the electron and laser polarizations refer to circular polarization .",
    ".beam and laser parameters used to characterize the real photon luminosity at linx . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the phythia interface to pandora allows events to be written in stdhep format @xcite , which in turn are read in by the lcdroot @xcite - a detector simulation and analysis framework based on root @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the p@xmath7 final states and background were propagated through a small version of a hypothetical nlc detector whose electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters reside in 5 t magnetic field .",
    "details of the detector @xcite are not crucial to the results",
    ". passage of p@xmath7 through the detector simulation results in momenta smearing . in the hadronic calorimeter",
    "the momenta is inferred . for this analysis",
    "only inclusive decays to p@xmath7 are considered , thus all particles reaching the hadronic calorimeters were assumed to have the mass of a proton . with this information and the total energy measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter",
    "the four vector is constructed and the invariant mass is calculated .",
    "figure [ fig : events ] is a reconstruction of the invariant mass of events leaving a track in the hadronic calorimeter subject to the restriction that @xmath8 0.6 and @xmath9 2.75 gev .",
    "the total number of reconstructed events ( 26,494 ) found in the last column of [ tab : final ] is significantly fewer than the 32,527 stdhep events input into lcdroot .",
    "this is an artifact stemming from the fact that kinematic cuts were not imposed on the meson events within pandora but rather inside lcdroot . for the isotropically decaying mesons",
    "the fraction lost is consistent with the restricted phase space imposed by the angular cuts .",
    "the meson events clearly stand out above the p@xmath7 background , although additional analysis is needed to determine whether it is possible to separate out @xmath10 and @xmath11(2s ) events",
    ". a thorough description of these results , including a complete treatment of the non - isotropic decay of the @xmath12 , will appear elsewhere .",
    "a @xmath0 interaction region has been proposed for the nlc using compton - backscattered photons .",
    "technical challenges integrating the optical , laser and mechanical subsystems suggest the desirability of a low - energy testbed . in this paper",
    "we address one aspect of a physics program that could accompany such a test bed - heavy meson production - and compare it with similar meson production expected where virtual photons are the means of production .",
    "we find that after a single year of operation the number of charmed mesons seen at a linx facility equals or exceeds the number generated at either babar+belle or lep to - date .",
    "linx is especially dominant when producing bottom mesons , offering the exciting possibility of discovering @xmath2(ns ) mesons before the lhc begins delivering data toward the end of this decade .",
