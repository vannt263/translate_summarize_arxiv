    "the dynamics of proteins involves high frequency vibrational modes that behave quantum mechanically even at room temperature ( @xmath0 k corresponds to @xmath1 @xmath2 ) .",
    "one such class of vibrations is the amide i mode , centered around 1650 @xmath2 and prominent in ir experiments due to its large oscillator strength .",
    "the amide i modes have been intensively studied by 2d - ir spectroscopy , which has provided new insights into their anharmonic couplings to the other vibrational modes and their intrinsic mode anharmonicities @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have also been stimulated to characterize the details of the vibrational states @xcite , and to probe the origin of the inhomogeneous lineshape broadening of the amide i mode @xcite .    in this study , we focus on the vibrational energy relaxation ( ver ) process of the amide i mode .",
    "recent pump - probe experiments @xcite have found that the ver of the amide i mode occurs on a a sub - picosecond timescale after its excitation .",
    "nguyen and stock @xcite have studied this phenomenon using molecular dynamics and instantaneous normal mode analysis .",
    "their results were found to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "nevertheless a more precise quantum mechanical description of the ver process is desirable .",
    "two of the authors @xcite have recently proposed a time - dependent perturbation theory to describe ver , and applied the formula to a small peptide - like molecule , n - methylacetamide ( nma ) , in heavy water using an empirical force field .",
    "they also observed ver on a time scale ( @xmath3 ps ) similar to that obtained experimentally , and further proposed a mechanism for the ver process .",
    "the present study explores the ver processes of nma _ more accurately _ by directly solving the schrdinger equation for molecular vibrations on _ ab initio _ potential energy surface ( pes ) . the nma molecule _ in vacuum _ is examined , excluding water molecules included in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "quantum dynamics calculations are carried out by the vibrational configuration - interaction ( vci ) method @xcite .",
    "24 vibrational modes ( out of 30 ) are explicitly treated in the dynamics , excluding the 6 lowest - lying modes including the rotational motions of the two methyl groups .",
    "we note that while the multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method @xcite provides a more flexible framework the vci method is sufficient for the present aim to investigate the vibrational motion of a semi - rigid molecule .",
    "the pes is approximated using a fourth - order taylor series expansion around the equilibrium geometry , which is called quartic force field ( qff ) , as @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the @xmath7th normal coordinate and the associated harmonic frequency .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are the third- and fourth - order derivatives of the pes .",
    "the above qff can be recast in the form of the @xmath10-mode coupling representation ( @xmath10mr ) @xcite as @xmath11 it is known that 3mr - qff is enough to characterize the anharmonicity of molecules studied @xcite , we thus have neglected the fourth - order terms including @xmath9 with @xmath12 .",
    "in addition to the above 3mr - qff , we study two types of approximate qff : ( 1 ) 2mr - qff that neglects @xmath13 @xcite and ( 2 ) partial - qff that takes into account only the terms associated with the amide i mode , that is , @xmath14 and @xmath15 if the subscripts do not include the amide i mode .",
    "note that the previous perturbation calculation @xcite also employed partial - qff to calculate the reduced density matrix . by adding the normal mode kinetic energy @xmath16",
    ", we have the full approximate vibrational hamiltonian @xmath17 for the system .      the vibrational self - consistent field ( vscf ) calculation is first carried out for the vibrational ground state to obtain the basis functions for the vci calculations .",
    "the vscf wavefunction is expressed as a direct product of one - mode functions or _",
    "modals _ as @xmath18 where * n * and @xmath19 denote the vibrational quantum numbers and the degrees of freedom , respectively",
    ". the modals are determined by @xmath20    \\phi_{n_i}^{(i ) } =   \\epsilon_{n_i}^{(i ) } \\phi_{n_i}^{(i)}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this vscf equation is solved for the vibrational ground state ( * n=0 * ) , and the @xmath21 modals constitute the vscf configurations to be used in the vci calculations . the vci wavefunction is expressed as a linear combination of vscf configurations as @xmath22 the vci wavefunction and energy levels are obtained by diagonalization of the vci matrix @xmath23    in this study , the modals were expanded in terms of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) wavefunction .",
    "the number of ho wavefunctions employed were 11 , 9 , 7 , and 5 for \\{@xmath24 } , \\{@xmath25- @xmath26 } , \\{@xmath27-@xmath28 } , and \\{@xmath29-@xmath30 } , respectively .",
    "the mode index is labeled in the increasing order of the frequency .",
    "see table [ tab : freq2 ] .",
    "the 6 lowest - lying modes were kept frozen .",
    "the vscf configurations were constructed by allowing the excitation up to 10 quantum numbers , and selected in the increasing order of the energy until the upper limit of the vci space , denoted @xmath31 , was achieved .",
    "the vscf / vci calculations were carried out using the sindo code @xcite for non - rotating molecules .    .",
    "calculated harmonic ( h.o ) and anharmonic ( vci and pt2 ) frequencies of nma based on the b3lyp/6 - 31g+(d ) level of theory .",
    "the previous cc - vscf and vci results and the experimental results are also listed for comparison .",
    "units in @xmath2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : pathway ]    ) , ( b ) 9th ( 869 @xmath2 ) , and ( c ) 12th ( 1066 @xmath2 ) mode . ]",
    "table [ tab : pathway ] also shows that the dominant ver pathways are well characterized by the above parameters for the @xmath32 excitation .",
    "figure [ fig : frp ] shows that other minor pathways take on values of @xmath33 that are smaller than @xmath34 0.01 and that the frequency matching condition is important to predict the fermi resonance parameter .",
    "it is interesting to note that the dominant pathways ( fig .",
    "[ fig : resmode ] ) are similar to those suggested in @xcite . in the case of @xmath35 excitation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : label ] , right ) , it is difficult to assign such a parameter because the relaxation processes can accompany higher order processes , but the dominant pathways such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the frequency matching ones .",
    "we conclude that the fermi resonance parameter or frequency matching condition is very important to characterize the ver pathways , and its consequence is discussed below .    .",

    "bottom : the inverse of the frequency mismatch @xmath40 as a function of the mode index @xmath39 . ]      from these observations ,",
    "we conclude that a relatively small number of resonant bath modes plays an essential role in the quantum dynamics .",
    "simplification of the pes or a reduction in the number of modes , including the resonant bath modes , can result in an inaccurate estimate of the dynamics .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : b3lypdynashort ] : the 3mr - qff and partial - qff results agree rather well up to 0.2 ( 0.5 ) ps for @xmath32 ( @xmath35 ) , while 2mr - qff results deviate from the other two at the initial stage .",
    "this is because the 2mr representation misses resonances mediated through the three mode interactions .",
    "it is interesting that the vibrational frequencies can be calculated accurately using 2mr - qff ; the fundamental ( first overtone ) of the amide i mode is obtained as 1713 ( 3414 ) , and 1716 ( 3421 ) @xmath2 by the 2mr- and 3mr - qff , respectively ( the difference is 0.2 % ) .",

    "we showed that our pes is accurate enough ( sec .  [ sec : accuracy ] ) , which is in accord with experiment @xcite and comparable to other theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the ver dynamics are much more sensitive to accuracy than the anharmonic frequency calculations . for example , gerber s group did not report any strong resonant interaction between the amide i mode and other modes using mp2/dzp level of theory @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the level of theory for the pes ( mp2/dzp ) , but another possibility is due to the 2mr - pes in their calculations . as we showed above , 3mr - pes and 2mr - pes can provide similar anharmonic frequencies , but some resonance conditions should be missed in the latter , affecting the dynamics calculations . importantly , 2d - ir spectroscopy can directly detect anharmonic coupling in a molecule @xcite , and such data may be utilized to select an _ appropriate _ level of methods for a particular molecule .",
    "using the vci method , we investigated the quantum dynamics of deuterated n - methylacetamide in vacuum .",
    "we demonstrated the applicability of the method and were able to gain insight into the fundamental nature of ver in the molecule , relevant to the interpretation of ir and 2d - ir spectroscopy used as a probe of protein dynamics .",
    "the accuracy of the pes employed ( b3lyp/6 - 31+g(d ) ) was checked by the anharmonic frequency calculations and by comparing with experiment and other theoretical methods .",
    "we clarified the energy flow pathways from the @xmath32 and 2 excitations of the amide i mode , and interpreted our results using fermi resonance parameters , which represent the effective coupling strength betweem vibrational modes .",
    "this approach will be extended to condensed phase systems by invoking qm / mm methods @xcite or multiresolution methods @xcite to deal with dephasing problems and to simulate 2d - ir signals @xcite .",
