    "then @xmath57 can slide along all boundary components of @xmath284 .",
    "a handle slide looks on @xmath284 like replacing two components of @xmath285 by their connected sum , hence the number of components of @xmath285 decreases . from the proof of proposition [ pginvt ]",
    "we know that handle slides do not change @xmath262 .",
    "the handle slides of @xmath57 along the components of @xmath285 change @xmath284 into a disc .",
    "since @xmath297 consists of disjoint arcs and bubbles , all these can be removed by @xmath241 and @xmath116-moves .",
    "this will change @xmath57 into a bubble . remove the bubble by another @xmath241-move .",

    "let @xmath299 be the maximal tree subgraph of @xmath29 , containing all chords .",
    "the generators of @xmath204 are the edges of @xmath300 , and the relations are defined by the cycles of @xmath29 and the circles of both families .",
    "the fundamental group of the ribbon graph @xmath46 coincides with the fundamental group of @xmath29 , which is the free group generated by the edges of @xmath300 . to construct the splitting surface one glues discs to the boundary components of @xmath46 , which means to the cycles . for any cycle write a relation going along it and writing down only the edges in @xmath300 . in the cycles part of the edges",
    "are traversed in the direction opposite to their orientation . in this case",
    "write the inverse of the generator .",
    "gluing 2-handles along the circles of @xmath29 means introducing another set of relations .",
    "the circles are also sequences of edges , and only those in @xmath300 should be written .",
    "filling in 3-balls does not affect the fundamental group .",
    "there is another , simpler way to obtain the fundamental group for closed orientable manifolds , if the number of circles in each family of the gauss diagram equals the genus of the associated surface and no separation occurs .",
    "this is the method of proposition [ pi1 ] .",
    "the first homology group of @xmath0 is the abelian group generated by the edges of @xmath300 .",
    "the relations coming from the circles in the gauss diagram remain unchanged . in some cycles there",
    "could be edges appearing twice , with opposite signs . hence in @xmath301 in the relations coming from the cycles one writes only those generators that are colored by two different cycles .        thickened torus",
    ": :    @xmath302 can be represented by a diagram in figure    [ torusxi ] , which also shows how the curves are situated on the    surface .",
    "the count of cycles gives @xmath303 , so    @xmath304 , which equals the number of curves in each    family .",
    "one can also check , using the graphs @xmath259 of    section [ bdry ] , that each curve separates the surface into two    components .",
    "the proposition [ pg ] then implies that both boundary    components are tori .",
    "+ unknot complement : :    the diagram of figure [ unknot ] has @xmath157 cycles , which    implies genus @xmath305 , and drawing the graphs    @xmath259 one can see that the top family does not separate    the surface , while the bottom does , and we have two components . let us    count the fundamental group .",
    "the maximal tree @xmath299 is    thickened in the diagram .",
    "the generators are the arcs in    @xmath300 , as shown in figure [ unknot ] .",
    "the fundamental group    then is : @xmath306    where the last four relations come from the cycles .",
