    "according to the original concept by fulde and ferrell@xcite ( ff ) , as well as by larkin and ovchinnikow@xcite ( lo ) , a superconducting phase with nonzero center - of - mass momentum of the cooper pairs can be induced by the zeeman spin splitting of the fermi surface which appears in the external magnetic field .",
    "the fermi wave vector mismatch , caused by this fermi surface splitting , is detrimental to the pairing , but can be compensated by the emerging nonzero total - momentum of the cooper pairs .",
    "this allows for the superconducting phase to persist in magnetic fields substantially higher than the second critical field @xmath1 . in order to make it possible for the resultant non - zero momentum cooper pairing to appear , several requirements are to be met .",
    "first of all , the maki parameter@xcite should be large meaning that the pauli paramagnetic effect has to be strong relative to the orbital pair - breaking mechanism.@xcite moreover , the system has to be very clean as the fflo phase is easily destroyed by the presence of impurities.@xcite because of those rather stringent conditions there are not many examples for such nonzero - momentum pairing to occur .",
    "until now , the experimental signs of the fflo state have been suggested for the organic superconductors@xcite and the heavy fermion compound cecoin@xmath2.@xcite the quasi - two - dimensional structure of those systems leads to a strong reduction of the orbital pair breaking in the applied in - plane magnetic field , as well as to nesting properties of the quasi-2d fermi surface .",
    "both of these features are expected to stabilize the fflo phase .",
    "an indirect experimental evidence of nonzero - momentum pairing has been recently reported for a system consisting of ultracold @xmath3li atoms trapped in an array of one dimensional tubes.@xcite one should also note the ongoing theoretical investigations regarding the appearance of the fflo state in other systems such as heavy fermion superconductors with spin - dependent masses,@xcite iron pnictides,@xcite ultracold fermionic atoms,@xcite as well as layered@xcite and quasi - one dimensional@xcite superconductors .",
    "we consider here the case of a metallic cylindrical nanowire and demonstrate that the orbital effect , which so far has been regarded as detrimental to the fflo phase formation , can in fact induce the nonzero - momentum paired state .",
    "this situation is facilitated in a unique manner by the transfer of kinetic energy from the rotational to the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "namely , the rotational degrees of freedom lead to the fermi surface splitting since in the applied field the states with the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath0 and @xmath4 have opposite magnetic moments what in turn results in opposite energy contributions . the fermi wave - vector mismatch created by the splitting",
    "is transferred into the nonzero total momentum of the cooper pairs along the nanowire inducing the ff phase formation .",
    "we also provide an argument for a feasibility of such state observability .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we determine the quasiparticle states in the wire with nontrivial azimutal states ( i.e. , in the direction perpendicular to its length ) within a modified bardeen - cooper - schriffer ( bcs ) approach , in which the superconducting gap acquires an explicit angular momentum dependence .",
    "we also specify explicitly how the fermi wave vector mismatch arises solely from the angular - momentum induced fermi surface splitting .",
    "the self - consistent equation for the gap , together with that determining the chemical potential for the fixed carrier concentration , are also specified . in section iii",
    "we discuss our results , as well as predict concrete experimentally verifiable effects of sandwiching the ff states in the sequence of the bcs - type states with the increasing applied magnetic field . finally , sec .",
    "iv is devoted to a brief summary and a general discussion to what extent the proposed effect can be useful in creating / modifying the supercurrent in quantum - electronics devices .",
    "additionally , some details concerning the derivation of the self - consistent equations for the superconducting gap and the chemical potential are deferred to the appendix a , whereas the elementary determination of the superconducting parameters is provided in appendix b , together with a direct interpretation of our results .",
    "we start with introducing the cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 and choosing the gauge for the vector potential as @xmath6 , where the magnetic field @xmath7 is parallel to the nanowire axis .",
    "then the single - electron hamiltonian in the cylindrical nanowire then has the following form @xmath8\\ ; , \\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the electron mass and @xmath10 is the electron charge . to underline the role of orbital degrees of freedom we have neglected the zeeman term which complicates uneccesarily the analysis ( the argument remains of the same type ) . for the sake of completeness , at the end of sec .",
    "iii we show , that the inclusion of the zeeman term does not change the results qualitatively .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is simplified further due to the negligible role of the diamagnetic term @xmath11 which for nanowires is one order of magnitude lower than that of the order parameter . in the nanowire geometry",
    "the quantization of the single - electron energy into a series of subbands appears .",
    "these subbands are indexed by the orbital magnetic @xmath0 and radial @xmath12 quantum numbers , what leads to the dispersion relations @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the particle momentum along the nanowire ( @xmath15 axis ) , @xmath16 is the @xmath12-th zero of the @xmath0-th order bessel function , @xmath17 is the nanowire radius , and @xmath18 is the chemical potential .",

    "next , we include the effective electron - electron attraction term in the model and perform the bcs approximation with the possibility of non - zero momentum pairing ( with the momentum @xmath25 along the @xmath15-axis ) .",
    "the bcs hamiltonian is then of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the coupling constant and @xmath28 is the superconducting ( sc ) gap defined by @xmath29 with the gap modulation @xmath30 the primed summation means that @xmath0 runs over the nonnegative values only .",

    "( [ eq : hamiltonian_bcs ] ) one can see that for @xmath33 the pairing appears within each subband labelled with the radial quantum number @xmath12 between particles with opposite spins , momenta , and orbital momenta : ( @xmath34 ; @xmath35 ) .",
    "so the pairing contains both the translational and the rotational degrees of freedom . in the applied field the degeneracy with respect to @xmath0 is removed resulting in a shift between the subbands corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath4 [ cf .",

    "in such situation , a fermi - wave - vector mismatch appears .",

    "[ fig4](c ) ] one can conclude that for the selected resonant radius , there is a leading quasiparticle branch e.g. @xmath65 for @xmath58 nm ( corresponding to the energy gap @xmath66 ) that controls the superconducting gap enhancement .",

    "fig3](a ) .",
    "their influence on the formation of the ff phase can be explained as follows .",
    "as already mentioned , the impact of the applied magnetic field on different subbands is dependent on the orbital quantum number @xmath68 .",

    "close to @xmath69 the fermi wave vector mismatch between the paired electrons @xmath70 is compensated by the non - zero total momentum of the cooper pairs leading to the stable ff phase . however ,",
    "upon further increase of the field it is not possible to adjust the vector @xmath25 so as to sustain the pairing in such subband and the cooper pairs in this subband break up leading to a decrease of the energy gap and standard bcs pairing reentrance .",
    "this allows to formulate the conditions for the appearance of the ff stability regimes induced by the orbital effect in nanowires .",
    "namely , the ff phase appears only if the dominant quasi - particle branch has the orbital quantum number lower than the other superconducting branches excluding those with @xmath71 . _",
    "the number of ff stability regions is equal to the number of the subbands which fulfill this criterion .",
    "_ from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] one can see that for @xmath58 nm there are two subbands @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( subbands with @xmath71 are excluded ) with a larger quantum number than the dominant subband @xmath65 .",
    "this results in two ff stability regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) with different slopes of @xmath74 , ( fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) depending on the orbital quantum number @xmath59 corresponding to branches responsible for the @xmath36 paired phase .    as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the ff stability does not always appear with increasing field .",
    "such situation takes place when the dominant band corresponds to large value of @xmath59 and the depairing in this band appears before it does in other quasiparticle branches .",
    "the quasiparicle dispersion relations in such case ( @xmath62  nm , ( iii ) ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] together with the corresponding @xmath42 dependence of the averaged gap parameter and the contributions to the pairing coming from particular subbands .",
    "as one can see , for @xmath62 nm the largest contribution to the pairing originates from the subband with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "due to relatively large value of @xmath0 , the corresponding quasiparticle branch reaches zero energy before any other and as a result , the ff state induced by the less important branches does not appear .",
    "+ * _ zeeman effect_*. to underline the role of the orbital effect in the creation of the ff state in nanowires , the results presented so far did not include the influence of the spin zeeman term .",
    "however , it should be noted that the pauli paramagnetism is the second factor being able to create the ff phase in nanowires .",
    "the extension of our theoretical model for the case with the spin zeeman effect included , leads in a straightforward manner to the spin - dependent dispersion relations in the form analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : single_el_ene ] ) , namely @xmath77 where @xmath78 for spin - up and down electrons , respectively . diagonalization of ( [ eq : hamiltonian_bcs ] ) with the dispersion relations ( [ eq : single_el_ene_zem ] ) leads to the quasiparticle energies in the form @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present the stability diagrams calculated for the four nanowire radii i - iv , with the inclusion of the spin zeeman effect .    as can be seen the obtained results do not differ qualitatively from the corresponding ones presented in fig .",
    "the ff stability regions induced by the orbital effect are still clearly visible .",
    "nevertheless , as one can expect , the zeeman effect reduces the value of the critical magnetic field ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "its impact is crucial especially for resonances governed by the low orbital quantum numbers @xmath80 ; e.g. for @xmath71 the orbital effect is not operative and only the pauli paramagnetism determines the value of the corresponding critical magnetic field . by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] one can see that the largest reduction of the critical field is obtained for @xmath58  nm which corresponds to the resonance governed by the state with @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the inclusion of the spin zeeman effect does not alter the conclusion that for the states with higher orbital quantum number , which participate in the formation of the superconducting phase ( cf .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , the depairing takes place for the lower values of the magnetic field giving raise to the stable ff phase . for the resonances governed by the higher orbital quantum number @xmath0 the spin zeeman effect does not play the crucial role and to the first approximation it is negligible .",
    "for example , the reduction of the critical field for @xmath62  nm , governed by @xmath75 , is much less pronounced .",
    "the orbital effect ( i.e. the fermi - surface dependence on the orbital magnetic quantum number , @xmath0 ) in cylindrical superconducting nanowires results in the fermi wave - vector mismatch which can be transferred to the nonzero linear momentum of the cooper pairs . by solving the system of bogoliubov - de gennes equations numerically",
    ", we have shown that this effect leads to stability of the ff phase in certain ranges of the applied magnetic field oriented parallel to the nanowire .",
    "the nonzero total momentum of the cooper pairs is induced to sustain the pairing in the corresponding subbands what in turn leads to structure of alternating ff and bcs stability ranges as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] . to expose the role of the orbital effect in the formation of the ff phase , we have first neglected the usual spin - zeeman term in our approach .",
    "however , for the sake of completeness , calculations with the inclusion of the pauli paramagnetism have also been carried out subsequently and show no significant qualitative differences with respect to the case without the spin zeeman term included ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the proposed mechanism of the ff phase formation induced by the orbital effect appears only if few states with different quantum numbers participate in the superconducting phase . at the same time , the thicker the nanowire is , the more states take part in the pairing . as a consequence ,",
    "our analysis is restricted to relatively thin nanowires . nevertheless , by lowering the electron concentration",
    "we also decrease the number of states taking part in the pairing . as shown in one of our previous papers , @xcite this fact leads to the increase of @xmath55 oscillations as a function of sample size for nanofilms ( the same holds true for nanowires ) .",
    "this fact allows us to suggest that for a superconductor with low concentration of carriers , e.g. , for srtio @xcite , the presented effect may be observed also for much thicker nanowires .    by carrying out the specific heat measurements one could detect if the phase transitions between the ff and bcs phases , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , appear with the increasing magnetic field .",
    "moreover , one should note , that in the ff phase the cooper pairs have nonzero total momentum which in our case leads to a supercurrent flow along the nanowire induced by a parallel to it magnetic field",
    ". this fact can also be used as a signal in the experimental detection of the proposed effect , as well as can have practical consequences in quantum - electronic devices , in the sense that the current can be created and stimulated by magnetic field applied parallel to its direction .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have analyzed nanowires with a uniform cross section .",
    "one should note that the effect of sample nonuniform cross section can make the experimental observation of the ff state obscured , since the energy gain coming from the nonzero momentum pairing is rather small [ cf .",
    "[ fig3](c ) ] . on the other hand , a strong enhancement of the @xmath55 value with respect to that for a bulk sample should make the effect observable for uniform wires in the clean limit",
    "finally , a methodological remark is in place here .",
    "the quantum wires considered in this paper have a nontrivial dynamics in the dimensions perpendicular to its length .",
    "therefore , such systems can not be regarded as strictly one - dimensional .",

    "in particular , the role of the order - parameter quantum fluctuations has been discussed as a detrimental factor@xcite in the case of zero field .",
    "here we have considered relatively thin wires and have shown that a stable bcs or ff states can appear even for @xmath101 nm and in strong fields .",
    "such state of affairs can be understood within the following semi - macroscopic picture emerging from the ginzburg - london type of approach@xcite in which we treat the nanowire as a 3-dimensional cylinder filled with electron gas and do not include the quantum size effect explicitly .",
    "the london penetration depth @xmath102 is for the low carrier concentration @xmath103@xmath54 of the order of @xmath104 nm , i.e. , much larger than the wire diameter . on the other hand , the coherence length @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the fermi wave vector , is much smaller than @xmath107 and is of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "hence , we have the superconductor of extreme type ii .",
    "note that bulk al is the superconductor of type i. the difference appears because for the wire the carrier concentration is about 4 orders of magnitude smaller and in this situation , the values of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 will be vastly different .",
    "it should also be noted that in nanostructures the coherence length can be suppressed even more due to the quantum size effect@xcite . under the circumstance that the field penetrates the whole sample , we can estimate the second critical field , which is @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the flux quantum .",
    "explicitly , @xmath112 t , whereas the first critical field @xmath113 t . note that the fields , at which the ff state appears ( cf .",
    "figs 3(a ) , 5 , and 6 ) are in the similar interval , explicitly @xmath114 t .",
    "therefore , one may ask whether the flux lines do not form along the wire direction instead of the ff state .",
    "this seems not feasible because the wire is long and too thin as we have assumed at the start .",
    "explicitly , the size of the london orbit is @xmath115 and equals to @xmath116 nm and @xmath117 nm for @xmath118 t and @xmath119 t , respectively . in such case",
    "the ff state is formed , with the supercurrent density @xmath120 and stabilizes the superconducting state , as the cooper pair total momentum compensates the fermi wave vector mismatch .",
    "taking @xmath121nm@xmath122 ( cf .",
    "[ fig3]c ) we obtain the supercurrent @xmath123 , which for @xmath124 nm amounts to the value @xmath125a .",
    "the pair velocity in ff state is @xmath126 m/s , whereas the fermi velocity is about @xmath127 m/s , so the velocity of a steady cooper - pair flow is much smaller than the fermi velocity .",
    "one should note that such current in turn produces the magnetic field at the wire surface of the magnitude @xmath128 t , i.e. , far below the order of magnitude of the applied field . as a result ,",
    "the magnetic field induced by the supercurent in the ff state does not compensate the applied field which causes the fermi wave vector mismatch .",
    "obviously , this is a mean - field ( bcs - like ) picture which should most probably be amended by the discussion of the order - parameter fluctuation effects , since the coherence length is rather small .",
    "nonetheless , the present discussion provides a coherent overall picture , as well as justifies our assumption that the field is uniform within the sample volume .",
    "obviously , we assume that the wire cross section is uniform , presumably monocrystalline , and in the clean limit .",
    "perhaps , the ring configuration would be the best for experiments , since in such geometry the fulde - ferrell phase is more appropriate than a formation of the larkin - ovchinnikov supercurrent standing - wave state .",
    "parenthetically , the physical situation is reminiscent of what takes place in the case of high - temperature superconductors .",
    "it is thus tempting to suggest an experiment on wires ( or rather , thin stripes ) composed of a high - temperature superconductor .",

    "<S> we show that the fulde - ferrell ( ff ) phase may appear as a sole result of the orbital effect in a cylindrical metallic nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> namely , in the external magnetic field the two - fold degeneracy with respect to the orbital magnetic quantum number @xmath0 is lifted , what leads to a fermi wave vector mismatch between the subbands with opposite orbital momenta in the paired state . </S>",
    "<S> this mismatch can be compensated by the nonzero total momentum of the cooper pairs created by electrons from the split subbands what results in the formation of the ff phase . in this manner , a transformation of the orbital motion into a linear supercurrent parallel to the applied field is taking place . with the increasing magnetic field a series of ff stability regions appear , in between which the standard bcs superconducting phase is stable . for the sake of completness , we show , that the inclusion of the zeeman term in the model does not change the picture qualitatively , particularly if larger @xmath0 states contribute essentially to the fermi - surface splitting . a brief but important note concerning the possibility of steering the supercurrent by an applied magnetic field parallel to it , is also provided . </S>"
