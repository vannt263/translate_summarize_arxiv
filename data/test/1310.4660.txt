    "the aim of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at bnl rhic and at cern lhc is to understand the properties of very hot and dense partonic matter expected to be formed in these collisions .",
    "one of the objectives of such experiments is the identification and investigation of a phase transition from hadronic matter to what is known as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the hard jets created in hard parton scattering in the initial stages of heavy - ion collision will pass through the hot and dense matter and lose energy by collisional and radiative processes .",
    "this phenomenon is known as jet quenching where the high @xmath2 hadrons production has been found to be strongly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "other very important experimental evidence for the jet energy loss is the dihadron azimuthal correlation .",
    "the jet induced hadron pair distribution at rhic shows a double peak structure in the away side  @xcite for the intermediate @xmath2 particle .",
    "however , it is unclear how the parton - medium interaction affects the distribution .",
    "the possible explanation of this observation is that the coupling of jets to a strongly interacting medium may modify the angular distribution  @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the partonic jets traveling through the qgp leads to formation of mach cones  @xcite , cerenkov radiation  @xcite and wakes  @xcite , which may be observables as collective excitation of the medium .",
    "apart from the jet quenching many other signals of this nascent phase of matter have been proposed .",
    "these include electromagnetic probes ( photon and dilepton )  @xcite , @xmath3 suppression  @xcite , collective flow  @xcite and so on .",
    "however , the main difficulty in studying these probes lies in the determination of the initial conditions , such as , the isotropization / thermalization time vis - a - vis the initial temperature . in this sense , many properties of the qgp are poorly understood .",
    "the most pertinent question is whether the matter produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is in thermal equilibrium or not .",
    "the collective flow patterns observed at the rhic provide strong evidence for rapid thermalization at less than 1 fm / c after the collision  @xcite . on the other hand , using second - order transport coefficients consistent  @xcite with conformal symmetry it has been found that the thermalization time has sizable uncertainties due to poor knowledge of the proper initial conditions .",
    "plasma instabilities have been suggested to a play a major role in the isotropization process  @xcite . shortly after the collision ,",
    "the rapid expansion of the matter along the beam direction causes faster cooling in the longitudinal direction than the transverse direction , leading to @xmath4  @xcite i.e. , the phase space distributions of plasma particles become anisotropic in momentum space . at some later time , the system returns to an isotropic state due to the effect of the parton interactions which overcomes the plasma expansion rate .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested to look for some observables which are sensitive to the early time after the collision .",
    "the effect of pre - equilibrium momentum anisotropy on various observables has been studied extensively in the last few years .",
    "the collective modes in an aqgp has been investigated in refs .",
    "the energy loss of parton in an aqgp has been studied in refs .",
    "the effect of anisotropy on the photon and dilepton yield have been investigated rigorously in refs .",
    "@xcite .    when a high energy jet propagates through plasma , apart from the energy loss , it produces a wake in the plasma .",
    "the current and charge density wakes induced by a jet propagating in an isotropic and homogeneous qgp have been investigated by ruppert and muller  @xcite . in the high temperature regime ,",
    "the result shows the wake in both the induced charge and current density due to the screening color charge cloud , but no mach cones appear .",
    "on the other hand , in the quantum liquid scenario , if the jet travels supersonically , the wake exhibits an oscillatory behavior and mach cones can appear .",
    "however , using the htl approximation , the wake in the induced charge density shows an oscillatory nature in the backward direction at large parton velocity  @xcite in case of isotropic plasma .",
    "the color response wake in viscous media has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied the wake induced by the jet propagating through the anisotropic plasma . when the parton moves along the anisotropy direction with velocity less than the average plasmon speed ( @xmath5 ) , the anisotropy effect causes a small oscillation of the induced charge density .",
    "anisotropy amplifies the oscillatory behavior of the wake potential in the backward space when parton moves along the beam direction with velocity @xmath6 .",
    "however , we do not find any oscillatory nature of the wake potential , when the parton moves in the transverse plane with respect to the anisotropy axis .",
    "in all the above works the effect of collision has been neglected .",
    "the inclusion of collision in the boltzmann equation and its subsequent effect on the wake potential has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite assuming isotropic plasma .",
    "it is found that in case of collisional isotropic plasma , the wake behavior is less pronounced than in isotropic plasma  @xcite .",
    "now we investigate the wake behavior of the plasma by taking into account collisions in the aqgp .",
    "the effect of the collision can easily be taken into account by approximating the collision term in the boltzmann equation with the bgk description  @xcite .",
    "in this approach , the dielectric function has been calculated in isotropic plasma  @xcite and the collective modes of anisotropic collisional plasma  @xcite have also been investigated when the wave vector is parallel to the anisotropy direction . by using the bgk collisional kernel",
    ", we calculate the dielectric response function of a collisional aqgp for small anisotropy limit . based on this dielectric function",
    ", we will investigate the wake potential induced by a fast parton traveling through the collisional anisotropic medium .",

    "to obtain the gluon polarization tensor of a collisional qgp , we start from the boltzmann transport equation : v._xf^i_a(p , x)+g^i v_f^_a(x ) _ ^(p)f^i(*p * ) = c^i_a(p , x ) , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . @xmath10 $ ] is the gluon field strength tensor with gauge field @xmath11 or @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 are the @xmath16 group generators in the fundamental and adjoint representations with @xmath17 = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^{ab}$ ] , @xmath18 = n_c\\delta^{ab}$ ] and @xmath19 is the coupling constant .",

    "@xcite can be represented as c^i_a(p , x ) = -with @xmath32 .",

    "next we consider the behavior of the wake potential when @xmath89 , @xmath95 and @xmath101 .",

    "if we increase @xmath0 the oscillatory nature of the potential is washed away .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case when @xmath90 i.e. @xmath108 and @xmath94 .",

    "( 1b ) , various combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been considered . in all the cases the potential is lennard - jones type and",
    "the depth of the negative minima is larger than the isotropic case if one of the parameters is nonzero or both are nonzero .",
    "thus in this scenario the quarkonium state will be strongly bound and therefore , the dissociation temperature required to break the state will be higher as compared to the isotropic case",
    ". moreover , it will certainly affect the conical flow and other observables .",
    "the wake potential corresponding to the previous case with larger velocity is shown in the fig .",
    "( 2b ) . as before , for collisionless isotropic plasma ,",
    "the potential is of lennard - jones type with oscillatory behavior .",
    "with nonzero @xmath0 , the oscillatory behavior vanishes contrary to the case when @xmath109 for a collisionless isotropic plasma . for collisional(@xmath104 ) isotropic plasma , the oscillatory behavior is observed again .",
    "if we increase @xmath1 , the oscillatory behavior again vanishes .",
    "the vanishing and reappearing of the oscillatory behavior for certain combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is because of the fact that there is subtle competition between collisional isotropic plasma and collisionless anisotropic plasma .",
    "finally we note that in the forward direction in all the above cases , the wake potential is a modified coulomb - like potential .",
    "we have also examined the case for large @xmath0 . for @xmath94 and @xmath110 ,",
    "the potential becomes coulomb - like .",
    "it is also seen that increasing the value of @xmath0 the effect of collision becomes unimportant .",
    "however , for faster speed the potential remains lennard - jones type with no oscillatory behavior in case of collisional plasma . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the potentials remain of lennard - jones type for both values of @xmath111 considered here .",

    "thus the wake potential created by the parton moving in transverse plane has different behavior than when it moves in the parallel direction .",

    "in this work we have investigated the behavior of the wake potential induced by a fast parton propagating through the collisional quark - gluon plasma which is anisotropic in momentum space . to simplify the analysis , we have calculated the dielectric response function in small @xmath0 limit including the effect of bgk collisional kernel .",
    "we have presented the wake potentials for both parallel ( @xmath78 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath79 ) directions of motion of the fast parton with two different parton velocities .",
    "we see that when the parton moves in the parallel(@xmath121 ) direction with @xmath94 , the potentials become of lennard - jones type in the backward region and coulomb - like in the forward region for @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "however , the depth of the negative minimum varies with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for @xmath95",

    "however , if we increase @xmath1 the potential becomes coulomb - like irrespective of the values of @xmath0 . for @xmath95 , @xmath124 and @xmath125",
    "more or less similar behavior of the wake potential has been observed as in the case for @xmath94 .",
    "however , with any combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 we do not find any oscillatory behavior in the wake potential .",
    "observations of the oscillatory and non - oscillatory behaviors of the wake potential for certain combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 imply that , as long as @xmath126 remains below a certain critical value , the effect of collision becomes dominant .",
    "but when @xmath126 is greater than this critical value , the anisotropy effect takes over , irrespective of the values of @xmath1 , and the wake structure becomes similar to the case of collisionless aqgp .",
    "we also note that the anisotropic effect on the wake potential is speed dependent , and it has rich structure com- pared to the case of collisionless isotropic plasma .",
    "we observe that for @xmath95 the oscillatory effect is more pronounced for @xmath127 and @xmath103 .",
    "however , it decreases with the inclusion of collision .",
    "but for lower speeds the effect of anisotropy on the wake potential is minimal if the collision is included .",
    "we shall end by mentioning some of the phenomenological implications of the present work . in the present calculation",
    ", we see that the wake structure for collisional aqgp is less pronounced compared to the case of purely isotropic plasma , as well as collisionless aqgp .",
    "this will surely influence the conical flow and wave excitation in the plasma .",
    "second , as the depth of the potential changes depending upon the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it can change the repulsive and attractive parts of the interaction potential of a fast parton in the plasma .",
    "in particular , in our work , we have shown that the depth of the negative minima becomes deeper for collisional anisotropic qgp as well as collisional isotropic qgp when @xmath109 .",
    "this will lead to a stronger binding of diquarks propagating through the plasma requiring larger values of the dissociation temperature to separate the heavy quark bound state in such a scenario .",
    "thus , the nuclear modification factors of charm and bottom mesons should be reevaluated , applying the concept of the present work .",
    "moreover , it will also be interesting to explore whether such changes in the wake potential can influence the dihadron correlations .",

    "<S> within the framework of boltzmann transport equation with a bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) collisional kernel , we study the wake potential induced by fast partons traveling through the high - temperature qcd plasma which is anisotropic in momentum - space . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the dielectric response function of a collisional anisotropic quark - gluon plasma ( aqgp ) for small @xmath0 ( anisotropic parameter ) limit . using this , </S>",
    "<S> the wake potential for various combinations of the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath0 ) and the collision rate ( @xmath1 ) is evaluated both for parallel and perpendicular directions of motion of the fast parton . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the inclusion of the collision modifies the wake potential and the amount as well as the nature of the potential depends on the combinations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>"
