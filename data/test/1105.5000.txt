    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite provides a powerful theoretical method to understand the strongly coupled field theories . recently it has been applied to study the holographic models of superconductors ( superfluids ) phase transitions since the work  @xcite . for reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "since the condensed matter physics deals with the systems at finite charge and finite temperature , from the ads / cft correspondence the dual gravity should be described by a charged black hole .",
    "the phase transition studied in  @xcite is actually a holographic superconductor / metal phase transition .",
    "the model for holographic superconductors can be simply constructed by an einstein - maxwell theory coupled to a complex scalar field . in particular ,",
    "when the temperature of the black hole is below a critical temperature , the black hole solution becomes unstable to develop a scalar hair near the horizon .",
    "and the condensation of the scalar hair breaks the u(1 ) symmetry of the system . from the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , the complex scalar field is dual to a charged operator in the boundary field theory . and the breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry in gravity causes a global u(1 ) symmetry breaking in the dual boundary theory .",
    "this induces a superconductor ( superfluid ) phase transition @xcite .",
    "the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition was first studied in @xcite . in particular , they used a five - dimensional ads soliton background @xcite coupled to a maxwell and scalar field to model the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition at zero temperature .",
    "the normal phase in the ads soliton is dual to a confined gauge theory with a mass gap which resembles an insulator phase @xcite . when the chemical potential is sufficiently large beyond a critical value , the ads soliton becomes unstable to form scalar hair which is dual to a superconducting phase in the boundary field theory .",
    "the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition was also studied in @xcite .    to reveal the stability of a spacetime background ,",
    "a powerful method is to study the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) of the perturbations in this background , for reviews see @xcite . if the imaginary part of the qnms is negative , the mode will decrease in time and the perturbation will finally disappear which indicates that the background is stable against this perturbation . on the contrary , if the imaginary part of the qnms is positive , this implies that the background is unstable against this perturbation .",
    "the interesting thing is that if the perturbation has a marginally stable mode , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath0 , one always expects that this is a signal of instability , or rather a phase transition may occur . for the detailed discussions of marginally stable modes",
    ", one can refer to @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we employ the idea of marginally stable modes to study the s - wave and p - wave holographic insulator / superconductor phase transitions in ads soliton background at zero temperature .",
    "the construction of the system is like the one in @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of horowitz and hubeny s method @xcite to study the qnms of the scalar ( vector ) perturbations of this system . by increasing the chemical potential from zero to some critical value",
    ", the marginally stable modes will turn out .",
    "this means at the critical chemical potential the ads soliton background becomes unstable and will prefer to be an ads soliton background coupled with nonzero charged scalar ( vector ) fields .",
    "this argument is consistent with the previous studies on holographic insulator / superconductor phase transitions @xcite . in particular , the critical chemical potentials we get from the marginally stable modes are in good agreement with the ones in @xcite . actually , there are multiple marginally stable modes corresponding to various critical chemical potentials .",
    "these modes are related to the modes of node @xmath1 .",
    "however , they are unstable due to the oscillations of scalar ( vector ) field in the radial direction @xcite . by making use of the alternative approach , _ viz .",
    "_  shooting \" method , we plot the behavior of the scalar ( vector ) fields depending on the radial direction . from these diagrams",
    ", one can intuitively see the  nodes \" of these fields .",
    "the studies of qnms in ads soliton background are also investigated in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    ", we study the marginally stable modes of s - wave field in the probe limit .",
    "we find that the critical chemical potentials we derived are consistent with the results obtained by previous works . by making use of the same procedure",
    ", we explore the qnms of p - wave field in the ads soliton background in sect .. we draw our conclusions and make some discussions in sect ..",
    "following ref.@xcite , we set up this model in the ads soliton background @xcite : [ metric ] ds^2=l^2+r^2(-dt^2+dz^2+dy^2)+f(r)d^2.where , @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the radius of ads spacetime .",
    "in fact , this soliton solution can be obtained from a five - dimensional schwarzschild - ads black hole by making use of two wick rotations .",
    "the asymptotical ads space - time approaches to a topology of @xmath4 near the boundary . and the scherk - schwarz circle @xmath5 is required in order to have a smooth geometry .",
    "the geometry looks like a cigar whose tip is at @xmath6 . because of the compactified direction @xmath7 , this background provides a gravity description of a three - dimensional field theory with a mass gap , which resembles an insulator in the condensed matter physics .",
    "the temperature in this background is zero .",
    "it is well known that in this ads soliton background a simple solution for maxwell gauge field is @xmath8 . instead of @xmath9 at the horizon",
    "required by the ads black holes , @xmath10 can be any non - singular value at the tip of the ads soliton .    in the probe limit , we introduce a charged scalar field @xmath11 as a probe into this background which is a neutral ads soliton with a constant electric potential .",
    "the lagrangian for the charged scalar field is _",
    "matter=-|_-iqa_|^2-m^2||^2.the euler - lagrange equations of motion ( eoms ) for @xmath11 is [ eompsi ] ( _ -iqa_)(^-iqa^)-m^2=0.in the following , we assume that @xmath11 is real and @xmath12 . substituting @xmath11 into eq . and making the separation of the variables we can reach [ feom ] & & + ( 3r+)-+ + & & + ( q^2 ^ 2-m^2r^2 - -^2)f(t , r)=0.where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the eigenvalues of the following equations respectively + ^2h()&=&0 , + + + ^2y(z , y)&=&0.where @xmath15 , @xmath16 due to the periodicity of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for simplicity we will set @xmath19 which means that there are no momenta in the @xmath20 directions .",
    "further , we define @xmath21 and eq . becomes ( we have set @xmath22 ) [ reom ] r   ( r)+(+3r)r  (r)+[(+q)^2-m^2r^2]r(r)=0.where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath23 .    in order to investigate the phase transitions of this model , we recall that the marginally stable modes can to some extent reveal this critical behavior @xcite . in the studies of qnms ,",
    "marginally stable modes correspond to @xmath0 which indicates that the phase transition or the critical phenomena may occur .",
    "we will take advantage of the horowitz and hubeny s method @xcite to study these qnms .",
    "it is convenient to convert the @xmath23-coordinate to @xmath24-coordinate , where @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the infinite boundary is now at @xmath26 while the tip is at @xmath27 . in terms of this new",
    "coordinate @xmath24 , eq.([reom ] ) becomes x^4 _ xxr(x)+_xr(x)+r(x)=0.following the steps of horowitz and hubeny @xcite , we can multiply @xmath28 to both sides of the above equation , and we reach [ maineq ] s(x ) ^2_xr(x)+_xr(x)+r(x)=0 , where the coefficient functions are given by s(x)&= & , + t(x)&=&-f x^3+x^4_x f(x ) , + [ potential]u(x)&=&(x - x_0).note that @xmath29 is a regular singular point of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and we can polynomially expand them to a finite order like [ sexpand ] s(x)=_n=0^m s_n(x - x_0)^n.where @xmath32 is a finite integer .",
    "the series expansion of @xmath33 and @xmath31 can be similarly reduced .    unlike the ingoing boundary conditions of scalar field near a black hole horizon",
    ", the boundary conditions here can be a finite quantity at the tip of the ads soliton .",
    "we can expand @xmath34 and substitute it into eq .. then to the leading order we get ( -1)s_0+t_0+u_0=-4x_0 ^ 2=0 = 0.this corresponds to looking for a solution of the form [ expand ] r(x)=_n_n=0^na_n(x - x_0)^n.substituting and into and comparing the coefficients of @xmath35 for the same @xmath36 we find that [ an ] a_n&=&-_k=0^n-1[k(k-1)s_n - k+k t_n - k+u_n - k]a_k , + [ pn ] p_n&=&n(n-1)s_0+nt_0+u_0=-4x_0n^2.we set @xmath37 due to the linearity of eq .. the boundary conditions for the scalar field at @xmath26 is [ r0 ] r(0)=_n_n=0^na_n(-x_0)^n=0.and the algebraic equation can solve the modes @xmath38 .    in the following numerical calculations ,",
    "we restrict @xmath39 and @xmath40 just like the ones in @xcite . in practice , we will expand @xmath41 to a large order which is @xmath42 . in order to find the marginally stable modes @xmath0 of the system , we should restrict our attention to the potential @xmath31 in .",
    "one finds that @xmath38 and @xmath43 are symmetric ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this means that when @xmath44 the lowest - lying modes of @xmath38 will exactly be identical to the lowest - lying critical chemical potentials @xmath45 when @xmath0 .",

    "they agree with each other perfectly .",
    "in particular , when @xmath47 , @xmath48 obtained from the marginally stable modes is in good agreement with the result @xmath49 which is the critical value for the onset of the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transitions obtained in @xcite .",

    "the nodes @xmath53 can also be intuitively seen in the next subsection .",

    "we will work in the approximation that @xmath8 and the scalar field only depends on @xmath23-direction as well as that it is too small to back - react the background .",
