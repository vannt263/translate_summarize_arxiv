    "<S> we investigate two coupled nonlinear cavities that are coherently driven in a dissipative environment . </S>",
    "<S> we perform semiclassical , numerical and analytical quantum studies of this dimer model when both cavities are symmetrically driven . in the semiclassical analysis , we find steady - state solutions with different photon occupations in two cavities . </S>",
    "<S> such states can be considered analogs of the closed system double well symmetry breaking states . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the occurrence and properties of these localized states in the system parameter space and examine how the symmetry breaking states , in form of a bistable pair , are associated to the single cavity bistable behavior . in a full quantum calculation of the master equation dynamics that includes quantum fluctuations , the symmetry breaking states and bistability disappear due to the quantum fluctuations . in quantum trajectory picture </S>",
    "<S> , we observe enhanced quantum jumps and switching which indicate the presence of the underlying semiclassical symmetry breaking states . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present a set of analytical solutions for the steady state correlation functions using the complex p - representation and discuss its regime of validity . </S>"
