    "modern cosmology is based on the hypothesis called the cosmological principle , and the universe is assumed to be successfully described by a homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe model on large scales . in spite of its simplicity , this hypothesis is highly non - trivial because a realistic universe model should include local inhomogeneities , and the physical property of such a realistic model averaged over a sufficiently large scale does not necessarily coincide with that of the flrw universe .",

    "in information theory , if we have two probability distributions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and would like to quantify the _ distinguishability _ of the two distributions , the relevant quantity is known to be the relative information entropy ( sometimes called the _ kullback - leibler divergence _ )  @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the actual and presumed probability distributions , respectively .",

    "here we have adopted the formulation of averaging inhomogeneous universes developed by one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "we also conjectured that the measure  ( [ rie1 ] ) is an increasing function of time for sufficiently large times .",
    "intuitively this measure is likely to have the time - increasing nature , but detailed analyses are required to show it .",
    "it is actually significant whether this conjecture is correct because the positive conclusion for the conjecture will lead to the validity of our measure being regarded as entropy in a gravitational system .",
    "the possibility that our measure is concerned with _",
    "gravitational entropy _ has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the time evolution of the measure using specific models of an inhomogeneous universe , and examine on what condition the time - increasing nature of the measure holds .",
    "we employ the linear perturbation theory of a spatially flat flrw universe and a spherically symmetric nonlinear solution as inhomogeneous universe models , and illustrate the temporal behavior of the measure explicitly with the models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give a brief review of the formalism of averaging inhomogeneous universes by following ref .",

    ", we introduce a measure of inhomogeneity analogous to the kullback - leibler divergence , and derive the time derivatives of the measure with a general consideration for the time - increasing nature of the measure .",
    "we present illustrative examples of the time evolution of the measure using the linear perturbation theory and a spherically symmetric exact solution , in the sections  [ sec : linear ] and [ sec : ltb ] , respectively",
    ". finally in the section  [ sec : sum ] , we summarize our results and give an outlook .",
    "let us start by recalling the basic equations that govern the dynamics of a spatially averaged inhomogeneous universe , along the formulation developed by one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict our consideration , for simplicity , to an irrotational pressureless fluid with energy density @xmath6 and four - velocity @xmath10 , and work in a time - orthogonal foliation with the line element @xmath11 where @xmath12 are coordinates in the @xmath13 hypersurfaces ( with three - metric @xmath14 ) that are comoving with the fluid so that the four - velocity @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient for a description of the dynamics to use the expansion tensor @xmath16 , where an overdot @xmath17 denotes time derivative , and its trace @xmath18 ( the local expansion rate ) , and the traceless part @xmath19 ( the shear tensor ) . using these quantities as dynamical variables , the continuity equation and the raychaudhuri equation",
    "are written as @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the rate of shear squared .",
    "we define averaging of a scalar quantity @xmath23 by the riemannian volume average over a compact spatial domain @xmath9 : @xmath24 with the riemannian volume element @xmath25 ,   @xmath26 , of the spatial hypersurfaces of constant time .",
    "we also introduce an effective scale factor via the volume ( normalized by the volume of the initial domain @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 .",
    "then the averaged expansion rate is expressed in terms of the effective scale factor as @xmath29 the key concept in the averaging formalism is _ non - commutativity _ of two operations , spatial average and time evolution .",
    "this is expressed by a _",
    "commutation rule _ for the averaging of a scalar field @xmath30  @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the deviations of local values of the fields from their averages",
    ". averaging eqs .",

    "equation  ( [ ave - raychaudhuri ] ) tells us that the kinematical backreaction term consists of the fluctuation of the expansion rate and the averaged shear rate ; the former plays the role of effective negative pressure , and the latter can be regarded as additional matter density .",
    "in order to introduce a quantity that measures how the universe is inhomogeneous within the formulation explained in the previous section , we pay particular attention to the commutation rule for the matter density field : @xmath38 this means that the time evolution of the averaged density field does not coincide with the average of the density field evolved locally .",
    "we consider that the difference between @xmath39 and @xmath40 leads to the entropy production for the matter density field .",
    "this idea brings us to write @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an entropy associated with the density field .",
    "looking for a functional of the matter density field that satisfies eq .",

    "( [ dots ] ) that the time derivative of @xmath42 will generally be positive in view of cosmological structure formation , because , on average , an overdense region ( @xmath50 ) tends to contract ( @xmath51 ) to form a cluster , and an underdense region ( @xmath52 ) tends to expand ( @xmath53 ) to form a void . to be more precise",
    ", however , how inhomogeneities evolve depends on initial conditions , particularly at an early stage of the evolution . for example , a fluid element included in an overdense region does not necessarily have an initial expansion rate with the direction of contracting , because the density field and the local expansion rate are given independently in the initial data setting . at a sufficiently late stage , the effect of initial conditions will get weaker and inhomogeneities will evolve according to the intuitive manner as we mentioned above , leading to the positivity of the time derivative of the entropy .",
    "it is therefore plausible that , even if the time derivative of the entropy is negative temporarily , it will become positive eventually .",
