    "understanding the role played in the nucleon by heavy quarks , such as the charm quark , is necessary for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , one can not claim to have unraveled the rich structure of the nucleon sea until one has mapped out the details of the distribution of its virtual charm and heavier flavors .",
    "secondly , in the absence of a direct probe of gluons , charm leptoproduction remains one of the main sources of information on the nucleon s _ gluon _ distribution .",
    "furthermore , tagging charm in neutrino and antineutrino scattering allows one to probe the strange and antistrange quark densities in the nucleon . from a more theoretical point of view , in order to have a reliable procedure through which to analyze deep - inelastic scattering data , one needs to consistently incorporate heavy quark masses and threshold effects in the qcd evolution equations .",
    "recently there have been important new data on the charm structure function , @xmath1 , of the proton from the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite collaborations at hera , which have probed the small-@xmath2 region down to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . at these values of @xmath2 , the charm contribution to the total proton structure function , @xmath5 ,",
    "is found to be around 25% , which is a considerably larger fraction than that found by the european muon collaboration at cern @xcite at somewhat larger @xmath2 , where it was only @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "extensive theoretical analyses in recent years have generally served to confirm that the bulk of the @xmath1 data can be described through perturbative generation of charm within qcd .    at the same time , there are several lingering pieces of data which seem to suggest the possibility that a small component of charm exists which is intrinsically non - perturbative in origin @xcite .",
    "one of these is the emc data @xcite at large @xmath2 , some of which appear to lie above the perturbative qcd predictions , and which have in the past been taken @xcite as evidence in favor of a non - perturbative , or `` intrinsic '' charm component .",
    "furthermore , as recently discussed in ref.@xcite , there are some indications of intrinsic charm also from hadronic reactions , such as leading charm production in @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering .",
    "as found in ref.@xcite , some intrinsic charm may account for the larger than expected number of fast correlated @xmath9 pairs seen in the na3 @xmath7 experiment at cern @xcite , as well as for the anomalous polarization of @xmath9 seen in inclusive @xmath9 production in @xmath7 collisions @xcite .",
    "the initial analyses of the leptoproduction data suggested an intrinsic charm component of the nucleon with normalization of around 1% , although subsequent , more sophisticated , treatments incorporating higher - order effects tended to find only a fraction of a percent .",
    "the basic starting assumption in these analyses is that the perturbative generation of charm proceeds through the photon ",
    "gluon fusion process , illustrated in figure  1 . in their pioneering analysis , hoffman and",
    "moore @xcite considered the @xmath10 corrections to the intrinsic charm distributions , as well as quark and target mass effects on the charm cross section . with these refinements ,",
    "their work suggested that an intrinsic charm component of the proton , at a level of order 0.3% , was allowed  even required  by the data . in a more recent study ,",
    "harris , smith and vogt @xcite reanalyzed the emc data within the framework of ref .",
    "@xcite with updated parton distributions , and @xmath11 ) corrections to the hard scattering cross section .",
    "they found that while no clear statements about intrinsic charm could be made at lower energy transfers , @xmath12 gev , data at larger @xmath13 gev could best be fitted with an additional @xmath14 intrinsic charm component @xcite .    despite these claims of evidence for intrinsic charm , a number of recent global parameterizations of parton distributions @xcite",
    "have concluded that all @xmath1 data , including those from the emc , can be understood in terms of perturbative qcd alone , with no additional intrinsic charm component necessary . in view of these conflicting results ,",
    "it seems important that the question of the presence or otherwise of intrinsic charm be addressed using the latest available theoretical techniques for calculating @xmath1 , as well as different models for intrinsic charm .    to set the context for our analysis",
    ", we should point out a number of features which have been common to all earlier treatments of intrinsic charm in leptoproduction .",
    "firstly , one invariably assumes that photon ",
    "gluon fusion ( together with perturbative qcd corrections ) is solely responsible for perturbatively generated charm , _ irrespective _ of the scale @xmath0 at which one works . in light of recent developments in incorporating quark mass effects in perturbative qcd ,",
    "it is now in principle possible to go beyond this approximation and include more appropriate treatments in kinematic regions where photon ",
    "gluon fusion alone may not be the only relevant perturbative mechanism .",
    "a second point concerns the way that intrinsic charm is combined with the perturbative contributions . in particular , no treatment to date has considered the effects of @xmath0 evolution of the non - perturbative charm distribution from the `` intrinsic '' scale to the scale where data are taken .    in this paper",
    "we perform a comprehensive next - to - leading order analysis of the charm production data in which we compare several different methods of implementing charm in qcd structure functions . in particular , we consider :    @xmath15 _ massless evolution . _",
    "this approach assumes that below a certain scale , @xmath16 , there are @xmath17 active flavors . above this scale , one switches the number of flavors to @xmath18 in the coupling constant , coefficient functions and in the parton distributions .",
    "this scheme is sometimes referred to as the variable flavor number scheme ( vfns ) .",
    "@xmath15 _ photon  gluon fusion .",
    "_ in this scheme , the heavy quark is never treated as a parton , in the sense that the number of active flavors does not change , and a quark distribution for the heavy quark is never introduced .",
    "the entire contribution to the physical structure function from heavy quarks is generated through the photon ",
    "gluon fusion process depicted in figure  1 .",
    "this scheme is usually referred to as the fixed flavor number scheme ( ffns ) .",
    "@xmath15 _ interpolating schemes .",
    "_ while photon ",
    "gluon fusion should provide a reliable description of charm production in the region close to @xmath19 , it certainly should fail at large scales because of the lack of resummation of the logarithms in @xmath19 .",
    "conversely , massless evolution should be good at large @xmath0 , but not in the region around @xmath19 .",
    "schemes such as that proposed by aivazis et al .",
    "@xcite reproduce the relevant features of both the vfns and ffns approaches  namely , a reduction to ffns when @xmath20 , and to vfns when @xmath21 .",
    "unlike ref.@xcite , however , we include the full quark mass dependence not only in the gluon sector , but also in the quark sector , which has become possible since the recent work of kretzer and schienbein @xcite .    throughout the analysis we shall work in the @xmath22 scheme , and",
    "introduce an explicit charm distribution at a scale @xmath19 for the vfns and interpolating schemes .",
    "furthermore , our philosophy is that if there is any intrinsic charm at all in the nucleon , it should be considered as a parton distribution for all scales @xmath23 , if one is to use @xmath22 anomalous dimensions when evolving the distributions .    in the following sections we describe in turn the three schemes for incorporating charm , beginning with the standard massless qcd evolution and the photon ",
    "gluon fusion process in sections ii and iii , respectively .",
    "the interpolating scheme connecting these two limiting cases is described in section iv .",
    "incorporation of intrinsic charm into the analysis is outlined in section v , where we survey several models for the non - perturbative charm component .",
    "finally , in section vi some conclusions are drawn from the analysis .",
    "the simplest approach to describing charm in the nucleon is to assume that the charm distribution is @xmath24 below a certain scale , @xmath25 , and evolve charm quarks as massless partons . indeed , until recently , this has been the standard approach adopted in global analyses of parton distribution functions . in a scheme such as @xmath22 ,",
    "the scale @xmath25 is taken to be the charm quark mass , @xmath26 @xcite . above threshold , @xmath27 ,",
    "the number of active flavors increases by one in the coupling constant , splitting and coefficient functions . in this way",
    "the charm quark distribution is generated solely through radiative corrections from gluons and light quarks quark , the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 quarks are light , so too for heavier quarks , such as @xmath31 , the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath32 quarks would be light , and so on . ] present at @xmath33 .    at",
    "next - to - leading order , the charm quark contribution to the proton structure function is given by : @xmath34 with the boundary condition @xmath35 .",
    "the convolution `` @xmath36 '' here is defined by @xmath37 .",
    "the quark and gluon coefficient functions are those for massless quarks :    [ e1 ] @xmath38    where the @xmath39 refers to the standard `` + ' ' prescription @xcite .",
    "the gluon coefficient function , @xmath40 , is a pure singlet quantity , and as such is proportional to the number of active flavors .",
    "since one is calculating the contribution to @xmath5 from a single flavor , @xmath40 defined in eq.([e1b ] ) is the usual gluon coefficient function divided by the number of active flavors .",
    "the gluon distribution is evolved by taking as input a gluon distribution function at a scale @xmath19 , together with a quark singlet distribution , @xmath41 .",
    "using the boundary condition @xmath35 , the evolution is performed with 4 flavors .",
    "the evolution of the charm quark density is slightly more involved .",
    "firstly , one evolves the singlet combination from @xmath19 to @xmath0 using the full number of active flavors . the quark non - singlet combination , @xmath42 , is then evolved over the same range . since @xmath35 , it turns out that one is in practice evolving @xmath43 first as a singlet and then as a non - singlet . the charm distribution at @xmath0 is then given by : @xmath44 for large @xmath0 , @xmath21 , one expects the generation of charm through massless evolution to be a good approximation , a result confirmed in previous studies @xcite . however , at smaller @xmath0 , @xmath20 , mass effects become important , and this approach eventually breaks down . in this region a better approximation is the photon ",
    "gluon fusion process , which we discuss next .",
    "in the photon  gluon fusion approach the charm quark is treated not as a parton , but rather as a heavy quark , so that a charm quark distribution is never explicitly introduced .",
    "hence , @xmath45 for all @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "the charm structure function is given directly by a convolution of the gluon distribution and the hard photon ",
    "gluon cross section , figure  1 .    at lowest order ,",
    "the only process producing a heavy @xmath46 pair is the photon ",
    "gluon fusion , and the structure function is given by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath16 is the mass factorization ( and renormalization ) scale .",
    "the partonic cross section for producing a massive quark pair is given by : @xmath49 with @xmath50 note that the coupling constant is calculated at @xmath16 with 3 light flavors , the same number as used throughout in @xmath51 .",
    "there is no evolution equation in this approach  the distribution @xmath52 is never evolved .",
    "evolution equations are introduced only when the logs in @xmath53 are resummed via the renormalization group equations . in that case",
    "a heavy quark distribution is introduced and one recovers eq.([massless ] ) .",
    "one should mention that the gluon distribution in eq.([pgf ] ) is that given by a leading - order analysis of the data .",
    "this is because in eq.([pgf ] ) one has terms of the form @xmath54 , which are typical next - to - leading order contributions if the gluon distribution is calculated in leading order  hence one is calculating @xmath10 corrections to the structure function .",
    "the use of a next - to - leading order gluon would produce next - to - next - to - leading order corrections , which would then require calculation of radiative corrections to the photon ",
    "gluon fusion term , and the addition of extra terms in eq.([pgf ] ) arising from heavy pair creation from light quarks @xcite .    the advantage of the photon ",
    "gluon fusion formulation is its simplicity .",
    "however , the use of eq.([pgf ] ) could be problematic at very large @xmath0 because of the large @xmath55 term appearing in @xmath51 .",
    "one way of circumventing this difficulty is to construct a scheme which retains the features of photon ",
    "gluon fusion at moderate @xmath0 , but maps onto massless evolution when @xmath0 becomes very large .",
    "the description of charm production from the nucleon at an arbitrary scale requires a scheme which consistently interpolates between the two limits of vfns and ffns .",
    "a number of authors have pursued the construction of such schemes , both for unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite scattering .    with the exception of ref.@xcite , where the splitting functions were modified for quark mass effects",
    ", the essence of the interpolating schemes is to incorporate a mass dependence , as a function of @xmath56 , in the coefficient functions which would enable eq.([massless ] ) to be recovered when @xmath21 , and eq.([pgf ] ) when @xmath20 . by keeping the evolution equations unmodified",
    ", one ensures that the parton distributions ( for the 3 light quarks , for the gluon , and for the newly introduced charm distribution ) are defined consistently in the @xmath22 scheme .    until recently , quark mass corrections were only included in the gluon coefficient function , @xmath51 , while the quark coefficient function was taken to have the form derived for massless quarks @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is quite natural to think that the gluon sector , through the @xmath57 splitting function , would be responsible for the generation and evolution of a heavy quark distribution .",
    "furthermore , any quark mass correction ( other than that appearing in the new , massive , scaling variable ) would appear in the @xmath10 coefficient functions only . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "kretzer and schienbein also calculated the quark mass corrections to the quark coefficient function .",
    "they found that these were small in absolute terms , but of a similar order of magnitude as the total @xmath1 in some regions of @xmath2 , and for some choices of factorization scale .",
    "there are at least two reasons , therefore , why one needs to include these effects in the present analysis .",
    "firstly , with the introduction of intrinsic charm the quark sector may become relatively more important than the gluon sector in the region of @xmath2 where intrinsic charm is non - zero ; and secondly , the analysis of ref.@xcite focused on quark mass corrections to the quark coefficient functions at relatively small values of @xmath2 , while here we also need to examine the size of these corrections at large @xmath2 .    of course , the full massive coefficient functions introduce extra mass logarithms in the quark and gluon sectors , resulting in double counting when using the evolution equations for the charm and gluon densities .",
    "this is reminiscent of a scenario where logarithms have not yet been resummed by the renormalization group equations .",
    "the problem can be circumvented easily enough by requiring that in the limit @xmath58 the massless coefficient functions are recovered after introducing subtraction terms @xmath59 :    [ e3 ] @xmath60    where the factorization scale is chosen to be @xmath61 for both the interpolating scheme and the vfns ( a choice to which we restrict ourselves throughout this analysis ) .",
    "the function @xmath62 in eq.([e3a ] ) is the full massive quark coefficient function at @xmath10 , calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the subtraction terms are given by :    [ e4 ] @xmath63_+\\ ,                     \\\\",

    "figure  [ c2 ] shows @xmath1 evaluated according to the three schemes described above at @xmath67 and 0.2 , for a @xmath0 range relevant to the emc data .",
    "in addition , for the interpolating scheme we also show the effect of neglecting the quark mass dependence in the quark coefficient function , so that @xmath68@xmath69 is replaced by @xmath70 in eq.([interp ] ) . for the parton distributions the grv parameterizations @xcite",
    "note , however , that in the grv fit a charm quark distribution is never introduced explicitly , rather @xmath1 is always calculated via the ffns .",
    "the charm density is generated from the grv distributions by evolving with 3 flavors from @xmath71 gev@xmath72 to @xmath19 in next - to - leading order , then from @xmath19 to @xmath0 with 4 flavors according to the vfns .",
    "for the ffns calculation , the gluon distribution is evolved in leading order from @xmath73 gev@xmath72 to @xmath19 with 3 flavors .",
    "( note that the choice of @xmath16 in figure  [ c2 ] is only for the purpose of comparison with the other methods , which introduce charm at @xmath19 . in the final calculations",
    "the scale @xmath74 will be used for the ffns , which is also the value used in ref.@xcite . )    at small @xmath2 the effect of the mass - corrected quark coefficient functions on @xmath1 turns out to be negligible , and only slight at larger @xmath2 . as @xmath0 becomes large , one can see in figure [ c2 ] how the vfns and interpolating schemes converge . even at small @xmath0",
    "the difference between these is not large . on the other hand , while the ffns provides a good approximation to the interpolating scheme for @xmath75 gev@xmath72 , it dramatically overestimates the full result at larger @xmath0 , especially at large @xmath2 .",
    "since this is the region where most of the relevant emc data which we analyse lie , clearly we need to use the full interpolating scheme in order to draw reliable conclusions from our analysis .",
    "another source of uncertainty in the calculation of @xmath1 comes from the gluon distribution at large @xmath2 , which at present is not very well constrained . to cover the full range of allowed gluon distributions",
    ", we use the maximum and minimum gluon distributions from the mrst @xcite parameterizations in addition to that of grv @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 for the different next - to - leading order glue is shown in figure  [ c3 ] , where evolution was again performed as described in the massless evolution section the data at small @xmath2 in figure  [ c3 ] are taken from the zeus collaboration @xcite , while the large-@xmath2 data are from the earlier emc experiment @xcite . at small @xmath2",
    "all of the parameterizations fit the data very well . at large @xmath2",
    "the maximum - gluon mrst and grv fits also provide good descriptions of the data , with the exception of the two points at @xmath76 gev@xmath72 .",
    "the last data point at @xmath77 is not shown in the fits of refs.@xcite , even though this point appears to confirm the trend indicated by the @xmath78 point to lie somewhat above the perturbative qcd calculation . neglecting the large-@xmath2 , @xmath76 gev@xmath72 points",
    ", one would conclude that perturbative qcd fits the @xmath1 data very well , without any need for additional non - perturbative contributions @xcite . on the other hand , taking these points seriously has led several authors @xcite to conclude that the large-@xmath2 emc data provide evidence for an intrinsic charm component of the nucleon .    in the next section we shall study the large-@xmath2 emc data more carefully , with the aim of ascertaining whether these can be understood perturbatively , or whether they can indeed be interpreted as suggesting that a perturbative qcd treatment alone is incomplete .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between some of the large-@xmath2 @xmath1 data and predictions based solely on perturbative qcd has prompted several authors @xcite to take seriously the possibility that an additional , non - perturbative , component of @xmath1 may be necessary to account for the data over the full range of @xmath2 and @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we discuss how non - perturbative charm may affect @xmath1 , particularly at large @xmath2 , and how the intrinsic contributions can be included on the same footing as the perturbative effects .    in earlier analyses @xcite intrinsic charm distributions",
    "have simply been added to the perturbatively generated @xmath1 , @xmath79 where the perturbative contribution , @xmath80 , is given by eq.([pgf ] ) ( with higher order corrections ) , while the intrinsic charm contribution , @xmath81 , in its simplest form is : @xmath82 in practice , @xmath10 contributions to eq.([icsimple ] ) are fully implemented in this analysis ( the relevant expressions are given in ref.@xcite ) .    within the interpolating scheme of section iv ,",
    "the most natural way to implement intrinsic charm in @xmath1 is to modify the boundary condition for the charm quark distribution . instead of @xmath24 ,",
    "one now has non - zero distributions at the scale @xmath83 .",
    "the physical reasoning for this is that if there are non - perturbative processes producing charm in the nucleon , this charm can be resolved ( brought on its mass shell ) only when the system has sufficient energy . in the @xmath22 scheme ,",
    "the scale at which the number of flavors changes from 3 to 4 is @xmath83 , so that regardless of the dynamical origin of the charm , there will be enough energy in the system to open a new active flavor channel for @xmath27 . with this in mind , we next discuss several non - perturbative models which attempt to describe the generation of intrinsic charm in the nucleon .      based on the initial observation @xcite that the charm production cross section in hadronic collisions was larger than that predicted in leading order perturbative qcd , brodsky et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that the discrepancy could be resolved by introducing an intrinsic , non - perturbative , charm component in the nucleon wave function . in this model , which we shall refer to as `` ic1 '' , the nucleon is assumed to contain , in addition to the lowest energy three - quark fock state , a more complicated , five - quark configuration on the light - cone : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the three ( five)-quark probability . in order to explain the original data @xcite , the normalization of the latter was chosen to be 1% @xcite . assuming the five - quark wave function to be inversely proportional to the light - cone energy difference between the nucleon ground state and the five - quark excited state",
    ", one finds that the @xmath2-dependence of the @xmath32 quark distribution is given by @xcite : @xmath86 the anticharm distribution has the same shape as the charm distribution in this model , @xmath87 .    because the intrinsic charm in this model is assumed to be generated through @xmath88 processes , with each gluon originating from different valence quarks , the @xmath89 probability scales like @xmath90 relative to the perturbative component @xcite .",
    "this contribution was therefore interpreted in refs.@xcite as a higher - twist effect .",
    "our philosophy here is that since this is generated non - perturbatively , the resulting non - perturbative intrinsic charm distribution calculated at @xmath19 should be evolved as leading twist , on the same footing as the perturbative contribution .",
    "since there is only one kind of charm quark , irrespective of its origin , qcd corrections should affect both the perturbative and non - perturbative distributions identically .",
    "an alternative to the five - quark intrinsic charm model was considered in refs.@xcite , in which the charm sea was assumed to arise from the quantum fluctuation of the nucleon to a virtual @xmath91 configuration . in the following we shall refer to this model as `` ic2 '' .",
    "the nucleon charm radius @xcite and the charm quark distribution @xcite were both estimated in this framework .",
    "furthermore , the effects of hard charm distributions on large-@xmath2 hera cross sections , and in particular on the so - called hera anomaly @xcite , were studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the meson cloud model for the long - range structure of the nucleon has been used extensively to describe various flavor symmetry breaking phenomena observed in deep - inelastic scattering and related experiments .",
    "it offers a natural explanation of the @xmath92 excess in the proton over @xmath93 @xcite in terms of a pion cloud , which itself is a necessary ingredient of the nucleon by chiral symmetry .",
    "it also provides an intuitive framework to study the strangeness content of the nucleon , through the presence of the kaon cloud @xcite . whether the same philosophy can be justified for a cloud of heavy charm mesons and baryons around the nucleon",
    "is rather more questionable given the large mass of the fluctuation .",
    "nevertheless , to a crude approximation , one may take the meson cloud framework as indicative of the possible order of magnitude and shape of the non - perturbative charm distribution .",
    "furthermore , a natural prediction of this model is that the @xmath32 and @xmath94 distributions are not symmetric .    in the meson cloud model",
    ", the distribution of charm and anticharm quarks in the nucleon at some low hadronic scale can be approximated by @xcite :    [ mcm_final ] @xmath95    where @xmath96 ^ 2 \\over 1-x } \\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the light - cone distribution of @xmath97 mesons in the nucleon , and @xmath98 is the corresponding distribution of @xmath99 baryons . in eq.([fz ] ) the function @xmath100 describes the extended nature of the @xmath101 vertex , with the momentum dependence parameterized by@xmath102 , where @xmath30 is the @xmath103 center of mass energy squared and @xmath104 the @xmath105 coupling constant at the pole , @xmath106 . as a first approximation , one might take @xmath104 to be of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath107 coupling constant . in ref.@xcite",

    "the results are qualitatively similar to those obtained from the full interpolating scheme , namely the data at different @xmath0 seem to require different functional forms and normalizations for the intrinsic charm .    by varying the amount of intrinsic charm that the data can accommodate",

    "unraveling the rich structure of the nucleon sea is an ongoing endeavor which has taught us a number of important and sometimes surprising lessons in recent years . far from being a homogeneous background",
    "in which the valence quarks reside , the sea has proved to exhibit considerable intrinsic structure of its own .",
    "perhaps the most conspicuous structure is that in the light quark sea of the proton , where a number of experiments have now confirmed beyond any doubt a significant excess of @xmath118 over @xmath119 quarks @xcite .",
    "this in turn has created an environment in which the importance of _ non - perturbative _ effects in the nucleon is appreciated to a far greater extent , even when discussing structure at deep - inelastic energy scales @xcite .",
    "more speculative , and less constrained experimentally , are suggestions that the proton sea for heavier flavors might also exhibit characteristics which can not be attributed to perturbative qcd mechanisms alone @xcite",
    ". a prime example would be the presence of asymmetric sea quark and antiquark distributions , which have been searched for in the strange sector in both deep - inelastic neutrino and antineutrino scattering , as well as in electromagnetic form factors at low energies @xcite . indeed , there is no symmetry principle in qcd which would prevent sea quarks and antiquarks having different momentum distributions , just as there is no symmetry requiring the @xmath118 and @xmath119 sea to be equivalent .",
    "more challenging still is to identify possible non - perturbative effects in the charm sector , especially since the magnitude of the total charm component of non - charm hadrons is tiny .",
    "nevertheless , a number of pioneering studies @xcite of various charm production reactions have left us with lingering doubts as to whether perturbative qcd is the full story behind these processes . on the other hand",
    ", the evidence does nt appear to be conclusive enough to warrant introduction of intrinsic charm distributions in global data parameterizations @xcite , which to date have generated the charm structure function purely perturbatively .",
    "the present analysis has been an attempt to resolve the issue of whether the charm electroproduction data do indeed support the existence of non - perturbative components of the nucleon wave function , or whether they can be understood within conventional perturbative dynamics . to this effect",
    "we have used the latest available technology to describe charm production over the entire range of @xmath2 and @xmath0 accessible to experiment .",
    "our approach consistently interpolates between the two asymptotic regions of massless evolution at large @xmath0 and the photon ",
    "gluon fusion process at low @xmath0 , and includes quark and target mass effects and corrections for mass thresholds .    to a certain extent",
    "our findings confirm the existing state of affairs , in which some of the data show no evidence at all for intrinsic charm , while other data can not be fitted without additional non - perturbative input . even within the rather different models of intrinsic charm considered here , with varying normalizations",
    ", it seems difficult to simultaneously fit the entire data set in terms of a single intrinsic charm scenario  although there may be a slight preference for intrinsic charm in model ic2 at a level of about 0.4% .",
    "the clearest conclusion that one can draw from this is that more quality data are urgently needed to settle the issue . in particular , while the small-@xmath2 domain seems to be relatively well under control , the large-@xmath2 region , where cross sections are small and measurements more difficult , must be the focus of future experimental effort if the non - perturbative structure of the nucleon sea is to be resolved .",
