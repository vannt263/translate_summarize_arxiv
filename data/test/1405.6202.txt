    "the detectors now in operation at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will have to face a challenging environment after the accelerator upgrade to high - luminosity running ( hl - lhc ) , that is currently being planned to start in 2022 .",
    "the radiation levels expected there are typically a factor 10 larger , and the integrated luminosities  thus integrated radiation levels  a factor 6 more important than the design values at the lhc . the hl - lhc design parameters at 14 tev foresee a luminosity of @xmath1 , up to a total integrated luminosity of @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "typical exposure levels in the high - rapidity region of the calorimeters reach 30 gy / h in ionising radiation and @xmath3 in integrated fluences of high - energy hadrons .",
    "calorimeters designed for an adequate performance through the years of running at the lhc may need to be partially upgraded , to withstand these increased exposure levels at the hl - lhc .",
    "sampling calorimeters are being considered with a renewed interest as an option for hl - lhc detector upgrades .",
    "some inorganic scintillators have been identified , that are likely to perform adequately in the strong radiation field and high particle fluences present during hl - lhc running ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "a sampling calorimeter employing them might offer an interesting option in terms of costs and short light path .",
    "however , inorganic crystalline materials present mechanical challenges compared to plastic scintillators : this paper describes an innovative light collection geometry that minimises the mechanical processing complexity .",
    "it presents first test results demonstrating a successful signal extraction and evaluates possible wls candidates .    the cef@xmath0 crystal sample ( @xmath4 ) used in this test , provided with a 3 mm wide , depolished chamfer along one of its 10 mm long edges . ]    the geometry ( fig .",
    "[ f - channelelement ] ) consists of a sampling calorimeter cell made of passive absorber layers ( e.g.  w or pb ) interleaved with layers of an active medium made of inorganic scintillating crystals .",
    "wavelength - shifting ( wls ) fibres run along the four long edges of the stack , transporting the light to photodetectors at the rear .",
    "the chamfers along those edges have a width matching the wls fibre dimensions .",
    "on the crystal samples they are depolished to maximise the amount of scintillation light escaping the scintillator and reaching the fibres .",
    "the simplicity of the design minimises the mechanical processing complexity , compared to other geometries with grooves or holes machined through the stack .    in this paper ,",
    "a study has been performed , in order to to show that this concept is working for cerium fluoride ( cef@xmath0 )  @xcite used as the scintillating material . for the test ,",
    "a cef@xmath0 crystal has been prepared , with a 3 mm wide and depolished chamfer , as visible in fig .",
    "[ f - cef3 ] . coupled to it",
    ", several different types of materials have been tested as wls medium , using cosmic muons and laboratory @xmath5 sources to excite the cef@xmath0 scintillation .",
    "in particular , materials that might be sufficiently resistant to the hl - lhc radiation environment , such as cerium - doped lutetium - yttrium orthosilicate ( lyso ) and cerium - doped quartz , are compared to conventional plastic wls fibres .",
    "the most promising material being studied as a wls candidate is in fact cerium - doped quartz , which is photo - luminescent in range of wavelengths of the cef@xmath0 scintillation emission  @xcite .",
    "the presented results provide a proof - of - principle that this kind of light extraction geometry via wls fibres is viable .",
    "finally , an outlook is presented on a further possible optimisation of the different components and the steps leading to a full calorimeter cell prototype construction are shown .",
    "cerium fluoride is a scintillating crystal whose density ( @xmath6 ) , radiation length ( @xmath7 cm ) , molire radius ( @xmath8 cm ) , nuclear interaction length ( @xmath9 cm ) and refractive index ( @xmath10 ) make it a competitive medium for compact calorimeters . for barium - doped crystals ,",
    "the emission is centred at 340 nm , with decay time constants of 10 - 30  ns ; it is insensitive to temperature changes ( @xmath11c@xmath12c ) as well as bright ( 4 - 10% of nai(@xmath13 ) ) and thus suitable for high - rate , high - precision calorimetry  @xcite .",
    "minimum ionising particles deposit @xmath14 mev / cm in cef@xmath0 , and cosmic @xmath15 are thus an interesting means of exciting its scintillation .",
    "it should be noted that cerium is a readily available rare earth , which would allow moderating raw material costs , were a mass production envisaged .",
    "its melting point of @xmath16c allows applying well - known crystal growth technologies .",
    "a feature crucial for use in calorimetry at the hl - lhc , is its performance under exposure to considerable fluxes of high - energy hadrons .",
    "it has been demonstrated , that crystals can be grown , where the damage fully recovers  @xcite , and thus never builds up as it is the case for lead tungstate  @xcite and for lyso  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     based on the successful proof - of - principle measurements described above , a prototype cell has been constructed for tests in high - energy particle beams , whose 3-dimensional drawing is presented in fig .",
    "[ f - explodedchannel ] .",
    "the dimensions were optimised for a @xmath17 mev electron beam .",
    "ten samplings were foreseen , with tungsten absorber plates of 3.1 mm thickness and cerium fluoride crystals of 10 mm thickness ( fig .",
    "[ f - parts ] ) , for a total of 17 @xmath18 , while transverse dimensions of @xmath19 were chosen .",
    "it should be noticed that for this configuration the effective molire radius is @xmath20  mm , but a smaller value can be easily obtained through a different choice of relative absorber and scintillator thickness .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 mm thick tungsten plates and @xmath22 mm thick cerium fluoride crystals , @xmath23 mm is achievable .",
    "the mechanical support structure was conceived to be easily expandable in depth for beam tests at higher energies .",
    "the samples were all provided with 3 mm chamfers along the four 10 mm long corners , and a kuraray 3hf single - clad fibre was running along each one of the long cell edges .",
    "for the test , each fibre was coupled to a hamamatsu pmt with a bialkali photocathode of type r1450 , within a h6524 assembly , and it was aluminised at the end opposite to the photodetector .",
    "prior to an exposure to high - energy particle beams , the prototype was commissioned in the laboratory , by acquiring signals from cosmic muons required to traverse the cell along its length .",
    "this was achieved by placing the cell vertically upright , and triggering with scintillators placed on top and below the cell .",
    "muons going only partially through the length of the cell were not excluded , due to a trigger counter size slightly larger than the transverse cell dimensions .",
    "the correlation between sums of signals coming from wls fibres running along diagonally opposite edges is found in fig .",
    "[ f - cosmicschannel ] .",
    "this being raw data , the slight deviation from a unitary slope is due to the differences in quantum efficiency folded with the gain of the photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the measurement allowed to ascertain the functioning of all components and to make sure , that signals of detectable amplitude are generated .",
    "this paper summarises the work that has been performed so far , in pursuing cerium fluoride scintillating crystals used in a simplified sampling calorimeter geometry .",
    "the proposed concept has wavelength - shifting fibres running along the four edges of the stack , collecting light through slightly depolished crystal chamfers .    in proof - of - principle laboratory tests ,",
    "wavelength - shifted signals have been detected for conventional fibres from kuraray , and for ce - doped quartz fibres . while the fibres need to be further optimised for hl - lhc calorimetry applications , a full prototype cell has been built and commissioned in the laboratory with cosmic muons , before tests in a high - energy beam .",
    "the presented measurements demonstrate , that this principle with its components has the potential to be used for a high - rate , radiation resistant sampling calorimeter , as needed for hl - lhc upgrades , in a mechanical assembly that allows a simple construction .",
    "the excellent support of the eth zurich technical staff is acknowledged , in particular m. drge , c. haller and u. horisberger , as is the one of cern , by r. dumps , t. schneider and m. van stenis .",
    "we are grateful to a. vedda , n. chiodini and m. fasoli ( u. milano bicocca ) , and to kuraray ( japan ) for kindly providing us with samples for this test .",
    "we also acknowledge the effort made by hamamatsu ( japan ) and tokuyama ( japan ) , to provide us with the needed parts in time for meeting a stringent construction schedule .",
