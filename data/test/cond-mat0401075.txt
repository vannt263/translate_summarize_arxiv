    "many difficulties appear in scaling the liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum computers to multi - qubit , since the signal intensity is low sensitive and decreases exponentially with increasing the number of qubits .",
    "therefore , the maximal number of qubits of quantum computer using the current liquid - state nmr technology might be limited to 10 @xcite .",
    "although there are some methods developed for enhancing polarization , such as lower temperature and higher magnetic fields , dynamic nuclear polarization ( dnp ) @xcite , nuclear overhauser effect ( noe ) @xcite , cross polarization @xcite , etc . , unfortunately these approaches can provide only limited relief or need rigid conditions for polarization enhancement .",
    "a promising route to enhance the nuclear polarization is the utilization of optical pumping and spin exchange @xcite , which can increase the nuclear polarization by four or five orders of magnitude over thermal equilibrium .",
    "the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe and @xmath2he gases are greatly effective in the development of magnetic resonance imaging @xcite , surface science @xcite , probing of biological system @xcite , polarized targets @xcite , neutron polarization @xcite , precision measurement @xcite , polymer science@xcite , quantum computation @xcite , etc ..    hitherto , proton sensitivity enhancements are not very large in all experiments @xcite  except for surface enhancements @xcite , and all of these experiments have almost been implemented by using gaseous or liquid hyperpolarized xenon . the @xmath1h polarization has been enhanced by a factor of 0.1 to 2 on a 4.2 t nmr spectrometer at room temperature via cross - relaxation between dissolved hyperpolarized gaseous @xmath0xe and @xmath1h of the liquid benzene solvent , which has also been firstly called the spinoe by pines group@xcite . through dissolving compounds in hyperpolarized liquid xenon , the enhanced signal of over 45 for @xmath1h has also been observed at 1.4 t and 200k by happer s group @xcite . in xe ice ,",
    "larger nuclear polarization of hyperpolarized @xmath0xe has been transferred to @xmath3co@xmath4 by low - field thermal mixing @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we know , solid - state proton polarization enhancement has not been reported in the literature .",
    "solid - state quantum computers , which could execute the 10@xmath5 qubits operation brought out by divincenzo _",
    "et al_. , were widely noticed @xcite . considering that hydrogen chloride ( hcl ) and xenon",
    "have almost the same melting points between 160 and 170k , and the longitudinal relaxation time ( t@xmath6 ) of hyperpolarized @xmath0xe in solid - state ( 4k ) is about 500 hours @xcite , we put forward the idea of laser - enhanced solid - state quantum computer ( lessqc ) by mixing hyperpolarized @xmath0xe and @xmath1hcl .    in this letter",
    ", we firstly demonstrate that the polarization of hyperpolarized solid - state @xmath0xe produced by spin exchange is transferred to the proton of solid - state @xmath1hcl via spinoe without using low - field thermal mixing or hartmann - hahn matching condition .",
    "this method yields the proton enhancement of 6 by comparison of that without optical pumping on a bruker sy-80 m nmr spectrometer ( 1.87 t ) at 142 k , leading us to take a step towards realizing lessqc .",
    "the experimental apparatus , similar to that in ref . 26 , is shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "briefly , the whole system consists of an optical pumping system ( the right part of the valve k4 ) , which is used to produce the hyperpolarzied gaseous @xmath0xe , and a cross - relaxation and detection system ( the left part of the valve k4 ) .",
    "the two parts are connected by a cylindrical pyrex tube and separated by stopcocks .",
    "the whole system was evacuated with k2 , k5 valves closed and k1 , k3 and k4 valves opened .",
    "when the vacuum reached to 1.5@xmath710@xmath8 torr for several hours , the valves k1 , k4 and k5 were closed and k2 and k3 opened .",
    "the cylindrical pump cell containing a few drops of metal cs , with a volume of 600 cm@xmath2 , was loaded 760 torr natural isotopic xenon gas at room temperature and an atmosphere , then all valves were closed",
    ". the pump cell , which was placed in a 25 guass magnetic field generated by helmholtz coils , was maintained at approximately 333@xmath104 k by a resistance heater ( not shown ) during the optical pumping .",
    "the inner surfaces of the cylindrical pyrex tube and the pump cell were coated with silane in order to slow down the relaxation of the @xmath0xe upon collision with the tube wall .",
    "as soon as all valves were closed , laser light from a 15 w cw tunable semiconductor - diode laser array ( opto power co. model opc - d015 - 850-fcps ) at wavelength @xmath11=852.1 nm was introduced to the system . after passing through beam expander , glan prism , @xmath12/4 plate and convex lens ,",
    "the laser light became circularly polarized , and illuminated almost 4/5 of the pump cell volume .",
    "the propagation of the laser paralleled to the orientation of the magnetic field b. the circularly polarized laser resonates with the cs d@xmath4 absorption line and induces an electron spin polarization in the cs atoms via a standard optical pumping process @xcite . after about 25 minutes , the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe gas was produced by spin - exchange collision with the cs atoms .",
    "at the part of cross - relaxation and detection system , there were a liter of @xmath1hcl gas at room temperature and an atmosphere in the tank . k4 and",
    "k5 valves were opened to allow the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe and @xmath1hcl to be mixed , then transferred to the nmr sample probe ( 10 mm diameter , 8 mm inner diameter ) , pre - cooled to 172@xmath102 k , of the bruker sy-80 m nmr spectrometer .",
    "the temperature of the probe was subsequently reduced to 142 k in an evacuated glass dewar by flowing cold nitrogen gas from liquid nitrogen tank , which controlled by the bruker variable temperature unit .",
    "this temperature was kept , and the variation was less than 2 k at all times so that the mixture could be in the solid - state . since there exist imbalance of polarization , the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe and the thermally polarized proton , in the mixed system",
    ", the interaction between the @xmath0xe and the proton can make spin exchange occur via spinoe .",
    "the time dependence of the @xmath0xe nmr signal intensity ( solid circle ) observed after blending hyperpolarized @xmath0xe and @xmath1hcl is shown in figure 2(a ) .",
    "the observed spin - lattice relaxation time of @xmath0xe in the presence of @xmath1hcl is 29.6@xmath100.6 min .",
    "the initial rise of signal manifests the accumulation of solid - state hyperpolarized @xmath0xe in the probe , similar to that in ref .",
    "19 . at the peak signal ,",
    "the increase of accumulated @xmath0xe magnetization reaches a balance with the decay of @xmath0xe magnetization via spinoe with @xmath1hcl .",
    "after this peak point , @xmath0xe magnetization decays as a result of spinoe .",
    "so the solid line , a fit to data after the peak , represents the time dependence of @xmath0xe residual magnetization after a spinoe experiment .",
    "figure 2(b ) displays the time dependence of the solid - state proton nmr signal ( solid circle ) from the same run .",
    "both the accumulation of the condensed state mixture and the cross - relaxation between the proton and the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe contribute to the initial rise of the proton signal .",
    "the proton nmr signal reaches its peak vaule at a time t=280 s after the mixing , and decays towards its thermal equilibrium value ( dashed line ) at the same rate as @xmath0xe signal .",
    "the solid line represents a fit to data to guide eyes .",
    "we used pulse flip angles of 4@xmath13 and 9@xmath13 for @xmath0xe and @xmath1h respectively , and @xmath0xe was performed with a home - bulit probe .",

    "the autorelaxation rate of the proton @xmath34  of ( 66 s)@xmath51 is measured in the experiment so that one can obtain the cross relaxation @xmath36  by the equation ( 12 ) . therefore , the correlation time @xmath30  is estimated to be 6.18@xmath1410@xmath8  s. using the equation ( 6 ) , we can calculate that autorelaxation rates @xmath52  and @xmath35  are ( 81 s)@xmath51 and ( 62 min)@xmath51 , and cross relaxation rates @xmath36  and @xmath37  are 5.53@xmath1410@xmath8 s@xmath51 and 3.32@xmath1410@xmath53 s@xmath51 , respectively .",

    "although only the direct nuclear dipolar interaction is considered in the above discussion , in fact , there are so many factors , such as spin rotation , paramagnetisim , relaxation with the wall , inhomogenuous magnetic field , etc . , which can induce the relaxation .",
    "consequently the theoretical relaxation rates are smaller than the experimental ones , and predictions of the time dependence of the proton polariztion are larger than experimental results .",
    "assuming @xmath22  is equal to @xmath48  for simplification in our theoretical model , one can calculate the maximum solid - state proton enhancement of 7.1 using equation ( 13 ) , which is in general agreement with the measured value .",
    "although it is substantially smaller than the @xmath0xe  enhancement , this can not indicate the possibility that only a fraction of the total number of @xmath1hcl molecules interact with the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe by diploar - diploar . because only the natural xenon ( 26.4% enriched @xmath0xe , 21.2% enriched @xmath55xe ) has been used , at the temperature of 142k , the cross - relaxation between @xmath0xe and the isotope @xmath55xe can decrease the efficiency of polarization transfer from @xmath0xe to @xmath1h @xcite . on the other hand , dipolar relaxation from diffusing vacancies dominates at this temperature for @xmath0xe spin - lattice relaxation @xcite .",
    "if we take into account of all above factors , together with the inhomogenuous magnetic field due to the fluctuation of eletromagnet and the polarization loss during the phase transition , etc . , all of these losses maybe counterbalance the difference between experimental values and theoretical ones .    according to equation ( 13 ) , for further increasing the proton enhancement ,",
    "one should first obtain the greatest @xmath0xe enhancement via employing the high power and narrow bandwidth laser , and/or increase the gas pressure of the pump cell in order to enhance the optical - pumped absorbed power when using the wide bandwidth laser . a small proton number density by using partially deuterated sample and a large @xmath0xe number density by using xe isotopically enriched with @xmath0xe also can boost transfer efficiency .",
    "in conclusion , we firstly obtained the solid - state laser - enhanced nmr proton signal of @xmath1hcl via spinoe by cooling hyperpolarzied @xmath0xe to solid - state at 1.87 t and 142k in the flow system .",
    "the amplification factor of the proton nuclear polarization is about 6 .",
    "the theoretical calculated enhancement is in agreement with the measured value .",
    "furthermore , the hyperpolarized @xmath0xe has long lifetime in the solid - state , which means that @xmath1h could keep the longer coherence time with hyperpolarized @xmath45xe .",
    "therefore this method may be useful to overcome one of the difficult problems in liquid - state nmr quantum computer and to establish solid - state quantum computers .",
    "solid - state signal enhancement via spinoe with hyperpolarized @xmath0xe is not limited to the proton , i.e. , it can be expanded to other nuclei .",
