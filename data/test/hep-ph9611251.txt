    "the addition of a @xmath0 gauge singlet supermultiplet to the mssm ( minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ) has been motivated by several issues : ( i ) the solution of the so - called @xmath1-problem ; ( ii ) the possibility of spontaneous breaking of the cp symmetry ; ( iii ) the upper limits on the higgs mass that are relatively low in the mssm could be relaxed ; ( iv ) the neutral particle spectrum is enriched by two scalars and one fermion , which could mix with other higgs bosons and neutralinos and modify their physical properties ; ( v ) possible deviations from the mssm could urge to enlarge the experimental searches , which have been centred upon the mssm .",
    "we refer here to the supersymmetric model with a gauge singlet in its simplest version , as defined below , as the ( m+1)ssm .",
    "however , according to our analysis , the strong constraints from lep experiments , when combined with theoretical and phenomenological requirements , select the ( m+1)ssm parameters in such a way that the gauge singlet scalars and fermions are basically decoupled and the rest of the spectrum effectively reproduces a restricted class of the mssm . because of this similarity , the motivations ( ii)-(v ) fade out as these issues are excluded or diminished after such a detailed investigation .",
    "nevertheless , this also means that phenomenological analyses of the mssm apply to a large extent to the ( m+1)ssm as well !",
    "still , if supersymmetry is found , one can go further and look for some peculiarites that could distinguish the two kind of models , specially in the case in which the lightest supersymmetric particle is the singlet fermion , or singlino .",
    "the ( m+1)ssm can also be experimentally tested from the fact that the effective parameters in the equivalent mssm are very constrained .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a thorough discussion of the model in its version with only dimensionless couplings in its superpotential , and universal boundary conditions for the soft supersymmetric breaking terms at the gut scale . with these assumptions , the dimensionality of the parameter space of the ( m+1)ssm equals that of the mssm .",
    "our aim is to understand the pattern of the particle spectrum , correlations among the particle masses , and features which are in common with or different from the mssm .",
    "an analysis of the complete parameters space of the model requires numerical methods , as a scanning over the independent parameters at the gut scale , their subsequent evolution using the rge down to the weak scale , the minimization of the higgs potential , the implementation of theoretical and experimental constraints and finally the computation of the particle masses and some mixing angles .",
    "many phenomenological analyses of the model have appeared before @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is twofold .",
    "first , we implement the most recent experimental constraints on sparticles , higgs and top quark masses from the lep and the tevatron @xcite .",
    "second , we explain the results of our numerical procedure with the help of analytic approximations and inequalities among the parameters . once the vacua which break colour , electromagnetism or correspond to @xmath2 are forbidden and the experimental constraints are imposed , these formulae allow us to understand the essential features of the bounds on and correlations among some particle masses .",
    "quite a lot of attention is paid to the property found in @xcite , namely , that the singlet scalar acquires a v.e.v . which is much larger than the higgs ones .",
    "indeed , this has the important consequence that the singlet fermion and scalars quite decouple from the the other multiplets as already mentioned .    in section [ sec : properties ] we review the motivations for the model , its essential differences with respect to the mssm due to the enlargement of higgs sector and the status of the spontaneous cp violation .",
    "the universality assumption for the soft terms and some of its consequences are explained in section [ sec : universal ] .",
    "section [ sec : mass ] contains the minimum conditions for the scalar potential as well as the scalar higgs masses with the radiative corrections included in an approximation that is generally good , though we use the full expressions @xcite in our numerical calculations . in section [ sec : stability ]",
    "we derive some approximate constraints from the stability of the vacuum to understand the pattern of the physical predictions . in section [ sec : inos ] we discuss some correlations in the mass spectrum along the same approximations",
    ". then we summarize our implementation of the experimental and theoretical constraints on the model , in section [ sec : cuts ] .",
    "the main results of the careful scanning of the parameter space are displayed in the figures in section [ sec : spectrum ] , with some emphasis on the sparticles more likely to be discovered at the colliders , with the exception of the higgs sector that has been already presented @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in the last section .",
    "some useful solutions of the rge for the soft terms ( with generic boundary conditions , for completeness ) are listed in the appendix .",
    "the superpotential of the ( m+1)ssm ( where family mixing is neglected and irrelevant for the analysis in this paper ) is given by    @xmath3    where the chiral superfields are denoted as follows : @xmath4 ( singlet ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( higgs doublets ) , @xmath7 ( antitop ) , @xmath8 ( antibottom ) , @xmath9 ( antitau ) , @xmath10 ( top - bottom doublet ) , @xmath11 ( tau - neutrino doublet ) . let us briefly review the present status of these motivations for the ( m+1)ssm .    a supersymmetric mass term @xmath12 is added to the mssm superpotential in order to avoid a potentially dangerous peccei - quinn symmetry and to allow for an acceptable minimum of the higgs potential .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath13 breaking then requires @xmath1 to be roughly of the same order of magnitude as the soft terms that embody the supersymmetry breaking effects in the two higgs sectors .",
    "this interesting hierarchy problem , the so - called @xmath1-puzzle , has motivated many a suggestion to link the supersymmetric mass @xmath1 to supersymmetry breaking @xcite .  in any instance , some kind of new physics is requested and in this sense the mssm that looks mostly economical at low energies is not necessarily so at the unification @xmath14 level .",
    "a natural solution @xcite is provided by the addition of a singlet @xmath15 soft terms that break supersymmetry can induce a v.e.v . for @xmath4 and an effective supersymmetric mass @xmath16 of the right order magnitude .",
    "this mechanism asks for the @xmath17 self - coupling in the superpotential which also breaks the unwanted peccei - quinn symmetry .",
    "however , this coupling would be forbidden and the singlet model inoperative if @xmath4 has non - trivial quantum numbers with respect to broken symmetries beyond those of the standard model .",
    "this phenomenon is frequently found in superstring compactifications .",
    "we take here the pragmatic viewpoint that all the dimension three interactions that preserve the low - energy local and global symmetries are to be included .",
    "as we shall discuss later , very low values of the coupling @xmath18 are consistent with the phenomenological constraints . in this case",
    ", it could be a relic of non - renormalizable interactions after the decoupling of , @xmath19 extra @xmath20 gauge symmetries . actually , the `` sliding '' singlet v.e.v .",
    "compensates for the smallness of the couplings @xmath18 and @xmath21 and this considerably reduces the fine - tuning problem of the @xmath1-term . such a possibility is indeed supported by our analysis .",
    "supersymmetric mass terms are forbidden by the @xmath22 symmetry of the purely cubic superpotential assumed in ( [ a ] ) .",
    "this discrete symmetry also prevents @xmath4 from getting a large v.e.v . through large radiative corrections",
    "to singlet tadpole terms , which invalidate other supersymmetric models with gauge singlets @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath23 symmetry can give rise to cosmological problems in the form of domain walls which are produced during the electroweak phase transition @xcite .",
    "possible solutions to this problem have been discussed in @xcite and include inflation of the weak scale , embedding of the discrete symmetry into a gauge symmetry at the planck scale or re - introducing of the @xmath24-term in the superpotential .",
    "( in the presence of the singlet , @xmath24 can be orders of magnitudes smaller than the weak scale , in which case our subsequent analysis is not affected ; however , the @xmath24-problem was part of the motivations of the model . ) in any case , since we concentrate in this paper on the particle physics aspects of the model and do not discuss cosmological issues , our results will be independent of the form of the solutions of the domain wall problem .",
    "the study of spontaneous cp breaking in the ( m+1)ssm also differs from the mssm . indeed ,",
    "cp violating vacua can be induced only if there are more than one phase - dependent interaction in the scalar potential .  in the mssm ,",
    "the only tree - level term is the soft scalar mass term @xmath25 .",
    "analytic terms of higher dimensions generated at the one loop level can conspirate with the tree - level one to induce spontaneous cp violation .",
    "however , this has been shown @xcite to entail a very low upper limit on one of the scalar masses which is inconsistent with present experiments at lep .",
    "the classical scalar potential processes a richer structure in the ( m+1)ssm , with three additional complex scalar couplings ( one of dimension four , two cubic soft terms , see next section ) .",
    "the conditions for cp spontaneous breaking in this type of models have been shown @xcite to imply a negative eigenvalue in the scalar ( mass@xmath26 matrix .",
    "however , top quark - squark loop corrections could shift this eigenvalue to positive values .",
    "thus spontaneous cp violation would occur for appropriate values of the parameters and one or two light scalars are predicted @xcite .",
    "this issue certainly deserves a more detailed comparison with phenomenology ; it lies outside the purview of the present investigation .",
    "because the very small region in the ( m+1)ssm parameter space consistent with spontaneous cp violation and those selected by our cp conserving solutions are apart , we disregard _",
    "ab initio _ the question of non - trivial phase vacua .",
    "upper bounds have been derived for the mass of the lightest higgs scalar in the mssm that take into account the large one loop corrections @xcite as well as some two - loop effects @xcite .",
    "this prediction is of paramount importance in view of the experimental searches of the higgs scalar in the lep 200 and the lhc .",
    "the ( m+1)ssm has an additional contribution @xmath27 to the higgs ( mass@xmath28 it has been shown @xcite that requiring the theory to remain perturbative up to the gut scale reduces this additional contribution to @xmath29(30 gev ) .",
    "the upper bounds on the lightest higgs boson mass are considerably lowered if one also imposes all phenomenological constraints needed for the model to be realistic .",
    "this has been done in the case of universal supergravity couplings @xcite and also for some special non - universal models @xcite .",
    "note that a relatively small increase in the higgs mass may affect the experimental signatures .",
    "since the predictions of the phenomenologically constrained ( m+1)ssm for the higgs sector has been the subject of a recent publication @xcite , we shall only give a short account of this important matter here .",
    "as for the particle spectrum , this model presents several new features as compared to the mssm .",
    "the supermultiplet @xmath4 consists of two scalars of opposite cp and one majorana fermion . after the @xmath13 breaking ,",
    "these states get mixed with the neutral states in the higgs doublet and gauge supermultiplets , leading to a slightly richer spectrum . in particular",
    ", since the visibility of physical states depends on their couplings to the gauge bosons and to matter , some particles could be relatively light if they are mainly gauge singlets .",
    "thus , some of the limits on neutral particles obtained at lep in the mssm framework do not immediately apply to the alternative ( m+1)ssm .",
    "the discussion in this paper as well as in our previous ones @xcite is also aimed to persuade experimentalists to analyze their data on a more general basis .    in the @xmath30 limit , the gauge singlet decouples and the remaining theory looks like the mssm @xcite . however",
    ", this limit leads to a particular version of the mssm with a strong correlation among the soft parameters , as we shall discuss later on .",
    "the singlet scalar takes a very large v.e.v .",
    "of @xmath31 , but the fermion singlet and both scalar singlets are rather light .    of course , the large dimension of the scalar field manifold allows for a rich structure in the overall scalar potential and leads to the existence of many local extrema @xcite .",
    "one has to carefully check that the phenomenologically viable vacuum is favoured with respect to the unwanted ones . among these",
    "there are the usual @xmath32 breaking ones , corresponding to vacua with quark and lepton quantum numbers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in the ( m+1)ssm there is the additional possibility of a non - vanishing charged higgs field vacuum .",
    "however , the necessary condition for this particular charge violating classical solution is a relatively large coupling of the higgses to the singlet @xcite , so that this situation is quite naturally avoided by a bound on that coupling.our theoretical and experimental constraints turn out to automatically selected the right region of the parameter space .",
    "actually , as we shall discuss here below , an acceptable minimum of the potential requires some inequalities among the soft supersymmetry breaking terms which would tend to induce @xmath32 breaking vacua as well .  the radiative corrections due to the gauge interactions then allow for a compromise while restricting the useful region in the parameter space . since the electroweak gauge symmetry breaking is induced by radiative corrections involving the top yukawa coupling  a well - known property in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  the existence of a physically acceptable vacuum in the ( m+1)ssm is a purely quantum effect .",
    "the supersymmetric part of the scalar potential is obtained from the superpotential through the well - known expression as a sum of @xmath33 and @xmath34 terms . the supersymmetry breaking part of the lagrangian",
    "contains all soft terms consistent with the symmetries of the superpotential : gaugino masses , trilinear analytic scalar couplings and scalar mass terms .  in the ( m+1)ssm they are as follows ( with the same notation for the chiral matter supermultiplets and their first component complex scalars ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the gauginos associated to the @xmath37 and @xmath38 gauge symmetries .",
    "only the terms involving the top scalars have been retained in ( [ b ] ) , with @xmath39 but similar interactions for all other squarks and sleptons are to be understood .",
    "all the parameters are taken to be real ( up to irrelevant phases ) and flavour mixing is neglected .",
    "notice that these soft terms contain all the dimensionful parameters of the model , which are all naturally related to the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath40 . in order to study the particle spectrum and @xmath13 symmetry breaking in the ( m+1)ssm",
    ", one should take the parameters in ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) at the relevant scales , the fermi scale @xmath41 gev or @xmath42 instead , it is natural to fix these parameters at the level of the underlying supergravity theory .",
    "we shall consider here the unification scale @xmath43 gev to define them .",
    "this is just a few orders of magnitude below the planck mass and one can presumable assume an effective renormalizable theory at @xmath44 once the parameters are given at @xmath45 their corresponding values at @xmath46 or @xmath47 are calculated by the integration of the renormalization group equations ( rge ) for the ( m+1)ssm @xcite .",
    "we present in the appendix the analytic solutions of the ( m+1)ssm rge in the approximation @xmath48 which turns out to be good for most of the set of parameters that will be selected on a phenomenological basis .",
    "however , for the sake of precision , we numerically integrate the rge in our analysis , the expressions in the appendix being reserved for analytical discussions of the numerical results . in practice , we renormalize the parameters down to the scale @xmath46 through the supersymmetric rge , and then apply the coleman - weinberg corrections to the higgs potential to take into account the decoupling of the stops at @xmath40 .",
    "the important hypothesis to be made in this paper is the so - called `` universality '' or flavour - independence for the soft - terms in ( [ b ] ) . for the supersymmetry breaking scalar interactions it amounts to assume a common value for all the parameters @xmath49 in ( [ b ] ) @xmath50    @xmath51    and the same values ( at @xmath52 ) for the scalar masses in ( [ b ] ) ,    @xmath53    this universality follows if the direction of supersymmetry breaking , characterized by the goldstino components , corresponds to fields with purely gravitational couplings to the relevant chiral superfields ( for instance , if it is along the dilaton - axion direction in superstring inspired theories @xcite ) .",
    "of course , it follows in general if the goldstino components have equal couplings to all relevant chiral superfields ; an example is given by the `` large radius limits '' of orbifold compactifications in string theory if supersymmetry breaking occur along the modulus direction @xcite .    as for gaugino masses , the universality hypothesis at @xmath52 reads",
    "@xmath54    in grand unified gauge theories many of these relations will be required by the enlarged gauge group at the tree - level .  at the one loop level one",
    "expects some threshold corrections to the universality of the soft terms already at the reference scale @xmath55 the deviations from ( [ c ] ) - ( [ e ] ) in the matter sector can be phenomenologically important because of the existent experimental bounds on fcnc effects but they are less relevant to our discussion in this paper .",
    "deviations from the universality assumption are also possible in the framework of superstring theory , since the moduli sector can couple differently to the various chiral fields . since the assumptions @xmath56 and @xmath57 play an important role in our phenomenological analysis , some of our results depend on the universality of the supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "however a similar analysis of the ( m+1)ssm has been published @xcite for the case of non - universal soft terms in the framework of an orbifold compactification of the superstring , and these results are quite analogous to those presented here .",
    "the most important consequences of the flavour independence of soft terms concern the @xmath13 symmetry breaking .",
    "it could be induced by a negative value of @xmath58 , but for the potential to be bounded from below and to avoid colour or @xmath59 symmetry breaking the universal parameter @xmath60 has to be positive , so that @xmath61 .",
    "for this reason , @xmath62 has to be enforced by renormalization effects .",
    "this is a well - known feature of the mssm as well , entailing a lower limit on the top yukawa coupling . in the ( m+1)ssm",
    ", the sign of @xmath58 could be made to flip by the coupling of the singlet fields even for a light top quark @xcite .",
    "the experimental value of top quark mass is perfectly consistent , however , with a negative @xmath58 at low energies from the effects of top - stop quantum loops .",
    "furthermore the cubic soft terms can also induce spontaneous symmetry breaking if the value of the parameter @xmath63 in ( [ c ] ) is large enough .",
    "hence large values of @xmath64 are preferred to give the singlet scalar a v.e.v .. however , with the universality assumption ( [ c ] ) , the squark and sleptons could also get non - vanishing v.e.v.s @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the gauge interactions reduce the @xmath63-parameters for matter fields while preserving the value of @xmath65 as can be seen from the expressions in the appendix . thus ,",
    "phenomenologically consistent ( m+1)ssm s with the condition ( [ c]),([d]),([e ] ) , can be build at the price of restricting the space of the supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "this is the most important restriction imposed on the model by the universality hypothesis , as compared to the mssm @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the effects of this universality on the @xmath13 spontaneous breaking are similar to those in the mssm .",
    "another consequence of this assumption is to reduce the number of free bare parameters in the ( m+1)ssm to five ( before imposing the physical constraints ) just like in the mssm : the dimensionful parameters @xmath8 and @xmath1 of the latter are replaced in the former by the dimensionless parameters @xmath21 and @xmath66 .    at low energies , the soft terms as obtained from the rge depend on the parameters @xmath67 on the choice of the gut scale ,",
    "@xmath68 through @xmath69 @xmath70 ( a typical value being @xmath71 and on the gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "this calculation has to be done numerically in general .",
    "however , from the dimensionality of these running parameters , they can be generically expressed at low energy in terms of their universal initial values as    @xmath72    where the coefficients depend on the various gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "for the simple case where the top yukawa coupling dominates over the others , the dependence on the latter reduces to simple expressions in terms of the ratio @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fixed point value of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "the results of this approximation are presented in the appendix and are used for the sake of some qualitative understanding of the numerical results . with the recent measurements of the top quark mass , @xmath75 is bounded by @xmath76 ( this is higher than the minimum value required to induce mediative @xmath13 breaking ) .",
    "as an example , we list the low energy soft parameters at the fixed point value @xmath77 the coefficients are approximated to a reasonable precision .",
    "@xmath78    1truecm",
    "let us first restrict the discussion to the physically relevant vacua with ( real ) v.e.v.s for the field @xmath79 the scalar potential restricted to this sector reads @xmath80    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the quantum correction to the effective scalar potential beyond the rge effects included in the running parameters of ( [ f ] ) .",
    "these radiative corrections are important , in particular in the evaluation of the lightest higgs boson mass .",
    "the relevant contribution comes from the top - stop sector because of the relatively large value of the top yukawa coupling .",
    "hence we only include the top quark and the two stop states , @xmath83 in the usual coleman - weinberg expression ,    @xmath84    the appropriate mass terms in ( [ g ] ) are then the top quark mass @xmath85 and the stop masses    @xmath86    all the parameters in ( [ f ] ) and ( [ g ] ) are to be taken at the scale @xmath87    these radiative corrections are mostly due to the splitting between the quarks and the squarks .",

    "this region is characterized , however , by a ) small values of the new yukawa couplings @xmath287 and @xmath66 , b ) a large value of the scalar singlet @xmath354 , c ) a strong tendency of the singlet states to decouple from the rest of the spectrum . in spite of the complexity of the model this region allows for fairly accurate analytical approximations to the vacuum minimization conditions and particle masses , which we have worked out and presented in some detail .",
    "the near decoupling of the singlet states leads to a particle spectrum , which is close to the mssm for a suitable set of the corresponding parameters .",
    "our figures show strong correlations or inequalities among the particle masses , which allow for experimental falsifications of our underlying hypothesises .",
    "for instance , as in the mssm with the universality hypothesis , sparticles are not light enough to play an important role for the radiative corrections to @xmath355 @xcite .",
    "only the higgs boson , the lightest chargino , sleptons and neutralinos could be light enough to be discovered at lep 2 ; gluinos , squarks and charged or cp - odd higgs scalars are necessarily too heavy in our model .",
    "our approximate analytic results allow to translate future possibly negative sparticle searches into constraints on the soft susy breaking parameters .",
    "obvious are lower limits on the universal gaugino mass @xmath207 from negative chargino searches ( cf .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) ) and , of course , negative gluino searches . from eqs .",
    "( 50 ) , one can furthermore easily deduce excluded regions in the @xmath356 plane from negative `` right - handed '' slepton and sneutrino searches .",
    "these relations are actually not different from the mssm .",
    "( 28 ) , however , allows to turn these constraints on @xmath289 and @xmath207 into constraints on @xmath211 , which is a particular feature of the ( m+1)ssm .",
    "if future sparticle searches turn out to be successful , and the mass pattern predicted by our model turns out to be confirmed , the question arises whether the model can be distinguished from the mssm with corresponding parameters .",
    "the answer depends on the corresponding parameters of the ( m+1)ssm .",
    "first , there still exist small corners in the parameter space , where mixing with the singlet states either in the neutral higgs sector or in the neutralino sector could be possible ; in this case the couplings of the corresponding visible particles could be substantially and hence measurably smaller than in the mssm .",
    "a more likely possibility - but by no means certain - is the singlino lsp scenario .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , in this case sparticle decays will produce an additional cascade with respect to the mssm .",
    "this scenario desserves further phenomenological investigations .",
    "in this appendix we list the analytic solutions of the rge for soft susy breaking terms in the approximation where the dependence on all yukawa couplings but the top one , @xmath357 are neglected .",
    "also , flavour mixing is neglected in these expressions ( see @xcite ) for solutions that fully take family mixing into account ) . however , for the sake of generality , universality is _ not _ assumed for the soft terms at the unification scale , @xmath358 all quantities are defined at the scale @xmath359 ( unless stated otherwise ) and the boundary conditions at the scale @xmath360 are generally denoted as @xmath361 we define the following quantities :    @xmath362    the index @xmath363 refers to the @xmath364 and @xmath365 gauge groups , respectively , and @xmath366 is the sum of the their quadratic casimir eigenvalues for the three fields in the i - th yukawa coupling . we replace the integral @xmath367 by the value @xmath368 of @xmath369 at the scale @xmath359 corresponding to a landau pole at @xmath370 by defining    @xmath371    the solutions for the yukawa coupling are then as follows    @xmath372    the soft trilinear terms are as follows :    @xmath373    soft supersymmetry breaking scalar masses can also be written in terms of @xmath374 and j ( or @xmath375 as follows :    @xmath376 _ { t=0 }   \\nonumber \\\\ \\overline{m}_{0}^{2 } & = & \\frac{1}{3}\\left ( m_{2}^{2}+m_{t}^{2}+m_{q}^{2}\\right ) _",
