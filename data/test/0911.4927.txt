    "this paper continues our effort to use the subaru telescope to search for proper motions among very faint stars .",
    "our first paper ( @xcite ) examined a series of images of the subaru deep field ( sdf ) ( @xcite ) , located close to the northern galactic pole ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) .",
    "we report here on a similar analysis of images of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) field ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , which lies at high galactic latitude in the southern galactic hemisphere ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) . as in our earlier work",
    ", we are taking advantage of a dataset compiled for the study of very distant extragalactic objects ; the long time coverage necessary to detect supernovae and agn provides us with the baseline needed to measure proper motions for a significant number of stars in our own milky way .",
    "we pay special attention to members of the faintest stellar populations , white dwarfs .",
    "since we will follow very closely the methods used in our analysis of the sdf , we urge the reader to consult @xcite for a detailed description of some procedures we may mention only briefly here .",
    "however , the sxds dataset differs from the sdf dataset in one very important way : it consists of a mixture of images taken through two passbands , the suprime - cam @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xcite ) , while the sdf data was all taken through @xmath6 .",
    "this inhomogeneity complicates efforts to determine the selection effects which define our sample of moving objects ; therefore , we discuss in depth our tests of the magnitudes and motions to which our analysis of the sxds is reasonably complete .",
    "one of our goals in this project is to compare observed sets of moving stars to those predicted by various models of stellar populations in the milky way .",
    "we will need a good understanding of the selection effects on the observations in order to compare them fairly to models in a future paper .",
    "section 2 describes the observations and the steps we took to convert the raw images into clean , seamless mosaic images .",
    "we list in section 3 our procedures for finding and measuring the properties of stars in the images , yielding a list of formal motions for tens of thousands of stars . most of these motions , of course , were not significantly different from zero , and so we discuss in section 4 our techniques for selecting a small subset of stars with significant proper motions .",
    "we used artificial stars inserted into our images to estimate the completeness of our sample as a function of magnitude and motion , and , to a limited degree , color . in section 5",
    ", we briefly compare our sample of moving stars with those found in the sdf and predicted in the the besanon model ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also highlight one very interesting star , which combines a large proper motion with a very faint apparent magnitude .",
    "the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) involves sensitive measurements across a wide range of wavelengths over a region of about 1.3 square degrees ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since the main goal of the project is to study extragalactic objects , the field is located at relatively high galactic latitude ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we analyze a subset of the optical images taken with the subaru 8.2-meter telescope and suprime - cam camera ( @xcite ) . the regions in the southern ( sxds - s ) and eastern ( sxds - e ) sections of the survey ( see figure [ fig : sxdsregions ] and table [ table : regions ] )",
    "were observed at least 11 times over the period september , 2002 , to january , 2008 .",
    "we provide a list of the observations in table [ table : journal ] .",
    "note that data taken on september 29 and september 30 , 2002 , were combined to form a single composite image .",

    "the fwhm of the mosaics varied from @xmath8 on the best night to @xmath9 on the worst , but since the plate scale was @xmath10 per pixel , all images were adequately sampled .    the limiting magnitude varied slightly ,",
    "but on average was about @xmath11 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "these measurements reach about @xmath12 magnitudes deeper than those reported in @xcite ; combined with the larger sky coverage , this study encompasses a larger volume .",
    "we estimate the effective volume for stars of absolute magnitude @xmath13 to be 130000 cubic parsecs , about four times as large as that of @xcite ( the value of 14000 cubic parsecs shown in table 1 of that paper was an error ; the proper value is 28000 cubic parsecs ) .",
    "we now describe briefly the steps we took to reduce the clean mosaic images into a list of starlike objects , and then to find objects with significant motions .",
    "the reader can find a detailed description of our methods in @xcite .",
    "our first step was to identify and measure the properties of starlike objects .",
    "we used the `` stars '' program in the _ xvista _ package ( @xcite ) to find objects with @xmath14 .",
    "the images taken on september 22 , 2003 , contained the largest number of objects : 79000 in sxds - e and 86000 in sxds - s .",
    "we therefore made this the fiducial epoch for matching and astrometry .",
    "we broke each image into overlapping subsections roughly @xmath15 on a side and used the _ match _ package ( @xcite ) to transform the subsections in each image to the fiducial s coordinate system .",
    "we looked for matches between epochs using a maximum separation of @xmath16 from the fiducial position of each star .",
    "this places an upper limit of about @xmath17 per year on the proper motions we could detect , but , as we will show later , this does not have a strong effect on the results .    in order to test the completeness of our object detection",
    ", we used a set of artificial stars inserted into the images of sxds - s . because this field was observed one fewer time than sxds - e",
    ", the limits we derive from it will likely be conservative estimates for sxds - e .",
    "the tests are complicated by the mixture of passbands in the dataset : eight in @xmath6 and three in @xmath5 , including the critical final image taken in 2008 .",
    "we therefore ran three sets of tests , using artificial stars with colors @xmath18 of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes . for each color",
    ", we created 1000 artificial stars and inserted them at locations known to be free of real stars in each image .",
    "we then executed our procedures to find and match stars .",
    "we required stars to appear in at least five epochs to qualify for further study .",
    "figure [ fig : completenesspqr ] indicates that the fraction of artificial stars entering our proper motion study dropped to 50% at @xmath22 regardless of color .    ( 80mm,80mm)figure2.eps    a large number of objects qualified for the next step by appearing in at least five images : 47589 in sxds - s and 45500 in sxds - e .",
    "we considered the row and column positions of each object separately , making a linear fit to each as a function of time .",
    "as described in @xcite , we derived the one - dimensional motion in rows and columns , as well as the uncertainty in each motion .",
    "figure [ fig : movingresiduals ] indicates that the precision of our measurements of position in the sxds is roughly the same as that of our measurements in the sdf . the median deviation in each direction from the fitted motion ranged from @xmath23 for bright unsaturated stars to @xmath24 for the faintest objects in our sample .",
    "we defined statistics @xmath25 and @xmath26 as the ratios of motion to uncertainty in each direction , and computed the overall significance of each object s motion as @xmath27 .",
    "we chose a conservative threshold , @xmath28 , to create samples of `` candidates for stars with proper motions . ''",
    "only a small number of objects entered these samples : 40 in the sxds - s and 33 in the sxds - e .",
    "the fraction of all objects having significant motions was only about @xmath29 , smaller than the @xmath30 found in the sdf .",
    "since the uncertainties in individual measurements were roughly the same in both areas , but stars were measured almost twice as frequently in the sdf , a fixed value of @xmath31 corresponds to a smaller absolute motion in the sdf than in the sxds fields .",
    "the time sampling of our survey was far from uniform , and there was a three - year gap between the penultimate and final measurement .",
    "moreover , that final measurement was made through the @xmath5 filter , rather than the @xmath6 filter used for most of the images . since that final",
    "image influences the proper motions strongly , it is possible that there might be some color dependency in our proper motion sample .",
    "therefore , we ran a set of tests using three sets of artificial stars : one group had colors @xmath32 , one ( @xmath33 , and one @xmath34 .",
    "we generated 1000 stars in each group with @xmath6-band magnitudes @xmath35 and proper motions @xmath36 per year in random directions .",
    "we inserted these artificial stars into our images , analyzed them as described above , and counted the number which appeared in our output set of stars detected as moving with significance @xmath28 .",
    "as figure [ fig : pmcolor ] shows , the efficiency with which we detect moving stars does depend on color for the faintest stars : we recover faint blue stars at a higher rate than faint red stars . at the bright end ,",
    "our efficiency drops to 50% for motions less than about @xmath37 per year for stars of all colors .",
    "our search in the sxds is slightly less sensitive to stars with small motions than our search in the sdf , due to the smaller number of images over a similar span of time .",
    "( 150mm,240mm)figure4.eps    we show in figure [ fig : pmhist ] the distribution of measured proper motions .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath17 per year is set by the matching limit of @xmath16 and the time difference between our fiducial epoch ( sept 22 , 2003 ) and the final epoch ( jan 9 , 2008 ) . since all but a single object have motions less than half this value",
    ", we conclude that the limit set by our matching procedures does not bias our final results .",
    "we will discuss the one object with @xmath38 per year in the next section .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure5.eps    we examined each candidate visually at several epochs to verify that the motions were real .",
    "we found 1 object in the sxds - s and 3 in the sxds - e which had bogus motions due to blends of two stars or a star and a galaxy . discarding those left 39 candidates in the sxds - s and 30 candidates in the sxds - e .",
    "we extracted corrected isophotal magnitudes in @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 passbands for each candidate from the catalogs of @xcite and compared them to the visual appearance of the candidate in images taken from the sxds data release 1 . in several cases ( 5 in sxds - s , 4 in sxds - e ) , we noticed an obvious discrepancy , always in the same sense : the catalog magnitude indicated a much brighter object than actually appeared in the images .",
    "we suspect that the matching procedure used to create the catalogs may have confused neighboring objects with very different colors .",
    "therefore , we corrected the magnitudes of these candidates as follows : we measured instrumental magnitudes of all candidates in the @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 images of the sxds data release 1 using a small aperture , @xmath41 arcsecond in radius .",
    "we examined the difference between our instrumental magnitudes and the catalog magnitudes in each passband ; in all cases , we found a nearly constant offset for both bright and faint stars , except for a few outliers .",
    "we then applied this offset to the instrumental magnitudes of the outliers .",
    "the discrepancies were largest in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 passbands and almost zero in @xmath6 .",
    "there is a small region of overlap between the sxds - s and sxds - e , as one can see in figure [ fig : sxdsregions ] .",
    "we noticed that two of the candidates in this region were actually the same object , detected and measured independently in each set of images .",
    "this object was one of the photometric outliers and serves as a test of our ability to compute accurate magnitudes .",
    "the difference in corrected magnitudes was @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 mag in @xmath40 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the annual proper motions derived in each set of images agreed very well : @xmath45 versus @xmath46 in ra , and @xmath47 versus @xmath48 in dec . however , when we compared the positions for this object drawn separately from the sxds - e and sxds - s catalogs of @xcite , we found differences of @xmath49 in ra and @xmath50 in dec .",
    "this may indicate the accuracy of the positions of the objects shown in table [ table : sample ] .",
    "the result is a sample of 68 stars with significant proper motions and good photometry in four passbands .",
    "we list these stars in table [ table : sample ] . as a final check on the reality of the motions",
    ", we can compare the measured motions to those predicted by the besanon model of stellar populations within the milky way galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : pmsignif ] shows that our measured motions are predominantly in the southeastern direction , agreeing with the model .",

    "following @xcite , we computed the reduced proper motion for the candidates in our sample in order to separate stars belonging to different populations .",
    "figure [ fig : reducedpm ] compares stars in our sample to stars in a simulation of the region based on the besanon model .",
    "the regions drawn in the diagram are exactly the same as those shown in figures 7 and 8 of @xcite .",
    "we adopt their relationship @xmath55 to compare our results to the models .      of the 68 objects in our sample , 13 lie within the `` white dwarf '' ( wd ) region of the diagram , 32 within the `` halo '' region , 12 within the `` disk '' region , 10 within the `` halo sd ? '' region , and",
    "1 falls far from all the rest ( we discuss that outlier below ) .",
    "the fraction of stars in each region agree reasonably well with the fractions found in our survey of the sdf .",
    "although the fraction of objects in the wd region ( 19% ) is somewhat higher than in the sdf ( 9% ) , we do not consider the difference significant , given the small number of objects in each set , and the number of objects lying very close to the somewhat arbitrary boundaries of the wd region in each sample .",
    "we performed multiple simulations using the besanon model to generate stars in the sxds over an effective area of two square degrees .",
    "we applied the selection criteria derived in section 3 to these simulated catalogs , then scaled the results to the actual area we observed ( 0.48 square degrees ) .",
    "we found a total of 12.5 wd in the simulation , which agrees well with the 13 candidates in the wd region of our reduced proper motion diagram .",
    "over half ( 56% ) of the wds in the simulation were members of the halo , with most of the remainder ( 34% ) drawn from the thick disk .",
    "one of the candidates , sxdspm j021840.0 - 053623 , deserves individual attention .",
    "it has the highest proper motion in our sample , @xmath56 per year ( see figures [ fig : candmotiondiag ] and [ fig : candpanels ] ) , and yet is very faint : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "the object is very red : our attempt to measure a magnitude at the object s position in the @xmath60-band image yielded a formal value of @xmath61 , but we choose instead to quote a lower limit of @xmath62 based on secure measurements of faint stars nearby .",
    "its colors @xmath63 and @xmath64 place it far from the locus of cool main sequence stars . if we use the more reliable @xmath65 color alone , the star might be an m9 dwarf ( @xcite,@xcite ) with an absolute magnitude @xmath66 .",
    "however , in that case , the distance to the object would be @xmath67 pc , and the tangential velocity @xmath68 km / s .",
    "the @xmath65 color of an l2 dwarf is not very different from our value , and the absolute magnitude of such a star , @xmath69 , would yield a lower velocity , @xmath70 km / s , consistent with the halo population .",
    "the residuals from a simple linear fit to the object s motion show no sign of parallax , which indicates that it must be at least @xmath71 pc away from the sun .",
    "the proper motions computed in this paper complement those we described in @xcite , since the sxds lies in the southern galactic hemisphere and the sdf in the northern .",
    "together , they comprise a set of 167 stars with reliable motions and multicolor photometry .",
    "we have characterized the selection effects of both samples as a function of magnitude , proper motion , and ( for the sxds ) color . our next step will be to compare rigorously the properties of the stars in our samples with the predictions made by current models of galactic populations , paying special attention to the objects likely to be white dwarfs .",
