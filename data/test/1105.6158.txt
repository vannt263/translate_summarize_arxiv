    "a self - consistent description of electrons , magnons , phonons and other fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in solids is still a challenging problem for strongly correlated systems where the simplest approximations are usually not sufficient .",
    "one of the classical examples is the theory of itinerant electron magnetism , where the d - electrons form both the correlated energy bands as well as the quasi - localized magnetic moments and the magnon spectrum @xcite . in this problem",
    "the conventional random phase approximation ( rpa ) gives a wrong description of the finite temperature effects whereas the proper corrections to rpa can be successfully calculated only in a very close vicinity of the stoner instability point @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is the coexistence of localized ( atomic - like ) and itinerant features in the behavior of d - electrons in solids @xcite .",
    "recent progress in the theory of correlated electron systems is related to the development of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite , which maps the problem of fermions with local interactions on a crystal lattice onto a self - consistent effective impurity problem .",
    "the latter can be solved very efficiently within continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) @xcite or exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite schemes . as a result ,",
    "both atomic - like features such as multiplet formation and band dispersion can be taken into account simultaneously @xcite .",
    "the combination of the dmft approach with realistic electronic structure calculations @xcite , in particular , for transition metal systems @xcite opens a new way for the description of electronic degrees of freedom in solids .",
    "a generalization of the dmft approach to non - local interactions and consistent description of collective bosonic excitations @xcite boost first realistic applications of a so - called gw+dmft approach @xcite .    here",
    "we construct a theory , that is capable to describe systems with strongly correlated electrons interacting with collective bosonic modes .",
    "these modes can appear explicitly in an original hamiltonian ( for instance , phonons ) or arise from electron - electron interactions ( like plasmons or magnons ) .",
    "we assume that the bose excitations can not be considered as an ideal bose gas and boson - boson correlations are important . among numerous examples of such systems",
    "are the cases of weak itinerant ferromagnets @xcite and , more generally , any materials near quantum phase transition points @xcite .",
    "the feynmann diagrammatic technique became the most popular tool in the quantum many body theory as a compact and elegant representation of a perturbation expansion in powers of interaction @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the diagrammatic approach is an opportunity to sum up infinite series of relevant diagrams going beyond the formal perturbation expansion .",
    "the mainstream paradigm is that summing up more sophisticated series expands the area of applicability . in some cases leading series of diagrams",
    "can be separated and summed up with the use of small parameters which are not directly related to the interaction strength .",
    "important examples are the gell - mann bruekner theory of the high - density electron gas @xcite , the gaseous approximations of low density fermi @xcite and bose @xcite systems , the @xmath0-expansion in theory of critical phenomena @xcite , and the @xmath1 expansion in the theory of magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "historically , the dmft was introduced as a leading order approximation in a formal parameter @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dimensionality of the space .",
    "dmft is exact in the limit of @xmath4 , at the same time attempts to construct a regular expansion in @xmath2 turn out to be not practical @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , dmft appears to be quite a good approximation for many three- and even two - dimensional systems @xcite , since it provides reasonable interpolations between non - interacting and atomic limits for any dimensions . in terms of the diagrammatic approach the dmft corresponds to a summation of all local in space contributions to the self - energy @xcite .",
    "recently we developed the dual fermion scheme @xcite which introduces new variables in a path integral generating an alternative diagram technique such that the bare propagators ( free dual fermions ) correspond to dmft .",
    "this means that the main local physics is taken into account by the change of variables while the new diagrams describe only non - local corrections to the self - energy .",
    "interaction terms in the dual variables look more complicated than the original ones : the interactions become retarded and contain not only pair terms but also multi - fermion contributions . however , an advantage of dual fermion transformation is a faster convergence of the diagram series .",
    "for example , a simple ladder summation gives quite accurate description for the single band hubbard model in strongly correlated regime @xcite .",
    "thus , the dual fermion approach is an example of an alternative strategy in the quantum many - body theory , when a proper choice of variables allows one to consider a simpler series of diagrams .",
    "another example of such strategy is the use of auxiliary fermions and bosons in the hubbard model which allows one to describe the subtle effect of the growth of the effective mass near metal - insulator transitions , already on the level of the mean - field @xcite .",
    "the consideration of collective ( bosonic ) degrees of freedom in systems of interacting fermions within the conventional technique necessarily involves summations of sophisticated diagrams .",
    "the dispersion law of bosonic excitations ( e.g. , magnons or plasmons ) is determined by the poles of the corresponding susceptibilities ( the two particle fermionic green s functions ) and the minimal approximations which give rise to these poles , even in the case of a weak interaction corresponding to the ladder summation ( random phase approximation , rpa @xcite ) . in order to take into account magnon - magnon interactions one needs to consider more complicated , parquet - like diagrams @xcite . for strongly correlated systems",
    "one can consider the same procedure within the dual fermion approach . up to now this is only done at the level of ladder summations @xcite . as we pointed out , the above considerations of complicated diagrams can be replaced by a proper choice of variables in the path integral .",
    "following this strategy we propose an extension of dual fermion scheme explicitly adding bosonic variables .",
    "it is important to note that the present theory is not a direct extension of the dual - fermion approach @xcite .",
    "we will see that , even for the hubbard - like models with on - site interactions only , it gives a different result because of the account of collective modes ( magnons ) .",
    "a simultaneous description of fermionic and bosonic correlations on the equal footing was started within the extended dynamical mean field ( edmft ) framework @xcite .",
    "the strong - coupling generalization of edmft @xcite gives a useful extension of the hubbard - i like perturbation expansion for lattice models @xcite .",
    "edmft properly includes the physics of _ local _ fermionic and bosonic correlations . at the same time , a dispersion of collective excitations within edmft is determined by the non - local part of the interactions _ only_. in particular , to describe the dispersive magnons within edmft one needs to explicitly add direct heisenberg exchange interactions to the hamiltonian .",
    "obviously , this is not sufficient since the _ indirect _ exchange interactions ( superexchange , double - exchange , rkky , etc . )",
    "contribute as well to the the magnon dispersion .",
    "moreover , typically , they give the main contribution .    in the present paper",
    "we construct a formally exact diagram technique where the bare fermionic and bosonic propagators correspond to edmft , whereas the indirect exchange is given by diagrammatic corrections .",
    "therefore , the direct and indirect interactions enter the magnon dispersion law on equal footing .",
    "we consider a lattice fermionic problem with the intersite hopping and generic non - local interactions . for simplicity , we present only formulae for the single - band periodic lattice , but a generalization of all expressions to a multiorbital case is straightforward . the action is @xmath5+\\sum_{r , r\\neq 0 , \\omega , \\sigma } \\varepsilon_r c^\\dag_{r \\omega \\sigma } c_{r+r \\omega \\sigma } + \\sum_{r , r\\neq 0 , \\omega } v_{r \\omega } \\rho_{r \\omega}^ * \\rho_{r+r \\omega}\\ ] ] here @xmath6 are grassmann variables , the indices @xmath7 run over the lattice sites and translations , @xmath8 stands for the wave - vector , @xmath9 is the imaginary time , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , the fermionic and bosonic matsubara frequencies ( @xmath12 is integer and @xmath13 is the inverse temperature ) , and @xmath14 is the spin index .",
    "prefactors @xmath15 and @xmath16 are implied for sums over frequencies and wavevectors , respectively ( @xmath17 is the number of lattice sites ) .",
    "the `` bosonic variable '' @xmath18 in general is a vector quantity , whose components for single band models can be the charge - density or the spin - density operators : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 with @xmath21 are pauli matrices ( @xmath22 ) , and the quantity @xmath23 is introduced to satisfy the condition @xmath24 .",
    "to simplify the notations , we skip the index @xmath25 throughout the paper , but one should bear in mind that relevant components of @xmath18 are to be accounted in a practical calculation . for example , if the physics is determined by charge fluctuations only ( as may be the case for the coulomb interaction or an electron - electron attraction mediated by phonons ) , only the density - density term @xmath26 is important in the interaction part @xmath27 of eq.([lattice ] ) .",
    "the heisenberg isotropic exchange interaction corresponds to @xmath28 , etc .",
    "an important case of the hubbard model corresponds to @xmath29 , where the spin degrees of freedom @xmath30 do not show up in the bare expression part of eq.([lattice ] ) , but will appear in the following formulation , since the low - energy behaviour of system is governed by the spin fluctuations .    within the path integral representation the atomic action @xmath31",
    "is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the local coulomb interaction .",
    "we are interested in the single - electron green s function @xmath34 and the bosonic correlator @xmath35 .",
    "it is an important point that an account of the bosonic quantity is fundamental : we suppose that collective modes are relevant for the physics of the system .",
    "the general idea of effective - medium approximations is to reduce the lattice problem ( [ lattice ] ) to the so - called impurity model , describing a single atom ( or small cluster ) in a gaussian environment . for a system with bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom ,",
    "a single - site impurity problem is described by the action @xmath36    obtaining a numerical or analytical solution for the impurity problem is supposed to be much simpler .",
    "we later assume that its green s functions : @xmath37 and @xmath38 are known , as well as higher - order correlators . in practice",
    ", they can be calculated by a ct - qmc scheme @xcite or by exact diagonalization if the dimension of the hilbert space is not too large .",
    "normally @xmath39 is called the full polarizability",
    ". we will call it the bosonic green s function , to emphasize the formal analogy between the equations for @xmath40 and @xmath39 in our formalism .    for the so - called local approximations ,",
    "only the green s functions of the impurity model @xmath41 are taken into account . in a nutshell ,",
    "the initial problem ( [ lattice ] ) is replaced by an auxiliary lattice with gaussian nodes ; those nodes are characterized by the green s functions @xmath41 .",
    "such a consideration gives us the well - known expressions for lattice green s functions @xcite , which are denoted with calligraphic letters in this paper : @xmath42 where @xmath8 is the wave vector and fourier transforms of the hopping and interaction parameters are introduced in the obvious way .",
    "one can see that the fermionic and bosonic self - energies of these expressions are @xmath8-independent , that is , local in space .",
    "the hybridization functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 should be defined in such a way , that the impurity problem provides us the on - site ( local ) properties of the solution for the lattice problem .",
    "such a requirement is physically quite reasonable .",
    "also , it is closely related to feynman s variational approach in dual fermion variables @xcite .",
    "most common are so - called static and dynamic mean - field theories . in the static approach ,",
    "the hybridization functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are chosen to be frequency independent .",
    "their values are defined from the equalities for the _",
    "static parts _ of green s functions : @xmath47    in the dynamical edmft approach @xmath48 and @xmath49 are adjusted so that local parts of the lattice green s functions coincide with the corresponding quantities of the impurity problem _ for all frequency ( or time ) arguments _ : @xmath50    it is worthwhile to note that the standard definition of the edmft @xcite introduces an auxiliary bosonic field called @xmath51 , and the second line of eq.([dmftcondition ] ) is re - expressed as a condition for the green s function @xmath52 of that bosonic field . at the edmft level",
    ", the conditions for @xmath53 and @xmath52 are equivalent .",
    "we discuss this issue in detail in appendix and show that similar ( although not the same ) bosonic field can be introduced in non - local approximations beyond the edmft .",
    "some `` mixed '' local approximations can also make sense .",

    "the single - electron green s function of the hubbard atom at half - filling @xmath216 has a time - scale @xmath217 , which we call fast .",

    "the finite - temperature expressions @xcite for @xmath223 contain a `` singular '' term proportional to @xmath224 .",

    "this derivation can be considered as a generalization of the effective exchange formula for the magnetically ordered case @xcite to the paramagnetic state .",
    "the standard theory of magnons in itinerant - electron systems @xcite is based on the rpa which is supposed to be exact at zero temperature ; at finite temperatures , magnon - magnon and electron - magnon interactions should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "electron - hole excitations are primary objects in such an approach , spin waves are coherent superposition of such excitations and , in general , are only well - defined in a restricted part of the brillouin zone , due to stoner damping . in the case of strong - coupling hubbard model , we have an `` anti - rpa '' situation when local magnetic moments are primary objects . therefore , completely different approaches should be used , e.g. those based on the hubbard x - operators @xcite .",
    "it is very non trivial that the dual boson approach describes these two opposite cases within the same formalism , thus providing a practical way to interpolate between weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "in summary , the general scheme for non - local correlation effects within the dual boson approach is presented .",
    "this method gives a direct means to obtain the higher - order diagrammatic contributions beyond the edmft scheme free from the double - counting contributions and it can be useful to describe the magnon - spectrum renormalization in strongly correlated systems .",
    "the method combines the numerically exact solution of an effective single - cite impurity model with frequency - dependent electron - electron interactions as well as an analytical diagrammatic expansion of non - local fermionic and bosonic self - energies .",
    "this approach is designed to describe of correlated systems with strong local fermion correlations and fluctuating non - local bosonic modes on equal footing .    in this paper we focused on the applications to the description of bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "additional contributions to the electron self energy also arise , in comparison with the dual fermion approach @xcite , e.g. , the diagram shown in fig . [ fig_sig ] .",
    "similar diagrams are important in the cases of coexistence of disorder with electron - electron @xcite or electron - phonon @xcite interactions .",
    "it is important to calculate these additional contributions within the hubbard model and make a detailed comparison with dual fermion theory",

    "the formalism presented here has an important difference compare to the common introduction of the edmft : whereas we introduce dual bosons @xmath79 by the hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the quadratic form @xmath252 , the term decoupling @xmath253 is decoupled in the standard edmft scheme @xcite .",
    "as one can see , this does not result in any physical consequences , as the two approaches yield the identical results for the averages @xmath254 over original variables .",
    "however , properties of the _ dual _ bosons , of course , do depend on their definition . in particular",
    ", the difference is about local properties of the dual propagator : for the present formalism , its local part vanishes in the edmft approximation , @xmath255 whereas the `` effective - medium '' condition @xmath256 holds for the decoupling ( [ vdecoupl ] ) . here",
    "@xmath257 is the green s function of the dual variables @xmath51 arising from the decoupling of @xmath253 : @xmath258 and @xmath259 is defined for the impurity problem with decoupled bosonic hybridization , so that @xmath260 to maintain a similarity with our formalism , we introduced in the above expressions a scaling factor @xmath70 , that is absent in the standard edmft scheme @xcite .",

    "we will now consider a general case of some approximation utilizing a decoupling of @xmath263 with an arbitrary @xmath264 .",

    "first , let us take @xmath268 , and use @xmath269 , as in the main body of the paper .",
    "for this choice , using ( [ w1 ] , [ exactw ] ) one can straightforwardly show that @xmath270 summing over @xmath8 and taking eq.([dbcondition ] ) into account we conclude that the condition ( [ dual0 ] ) is fulfilled @xmath271 it turns out that _ the dual propagator vanishes for variables obtained from the hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the renormalized interaction , with the hybridization part * excluded * _ , if the condition ( [ dbcondition ] ) is fulfilled .",

    "we stress that , strictly speaking , apart from the simple edmft case the conditions ( [ dual0 ] ) , ( [ dualem ] ) are not fulfilled simultaneously with ( [ dual0 ] ) .",

    "the difference can be essential .",
    "finally , we note that a specific choice of the decoupling procedure is physically irrelevant .",
    "as we have seen , edmft can be constructed using @xmath278 or @xmath279 , and the result for initial ensemble is the same .",
    "it can be checked that any other decoupling will also work ; what matters is the gaussian approximation for dual variables and the value of the hybridization .",
    "the latter is defined by the condition ( [ dual0 ] ) , that does not include any dual quantities .",
    "we use the theory based on @xmath280 decoupling because it allows a simple construction of the dual diagrammatic series without a double counting of the local contributions .",
