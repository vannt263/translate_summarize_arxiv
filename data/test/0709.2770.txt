    "the modern effective field theory ( eft ) analysis of the nn interaction using chiral symmetry as a constraint has a recent but prolific history  @xcite ( for comprehensive reviews see e.g. ref .",
    "most theoretical setups are invariably based on a perturbative determination of the chiral potential  @xcite and the subsequent solution of the scattering problem  @xcite .",
    "actually , the theory encounters many problems in the low partial waves and in particular in the @xmath2waves ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite for a more optimistic view ) .",
    "indeed , there is at present an ongoing debate on how an eft program should be sensibly implemented within the nn context and so far no consensus has been achieved ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the discussion is concerned with the issue of renormalization vs.  finite cutoffs , a priori ( power counting ) vs.  a posteriori error estimates or the applicability of perturbation theory both on a purely short distance theory or around some non - perturbative distorted waves . at the moment",
    ", it seems fairly clear that an eft scheme with a cutoff - independent and systematic perturbative power counting for the s - matrix ( the so - called ksw counting ) fails  @xcite . on the other hand , the original eft inspired scheme  @xcite ( the so - called weinberg counting )",
    "has recently been shown to produce many results which turn out to be strongly cutoff dependent  @xcite and hence to be incompatible with renormalizability  .",
    "thus , some acceptable compromise must be made .",
    "actually , the chosen approach between this dichotomy depends strongly on the pursued goals and it is fair to say that any choice has both advantages and disadvantages . in any case , the reason for both failures can be traced back to the nature of the long - distance chiral potentials ; while pion - exchange potentials fall off exponentially at long distances they include strong power - law singularities at short distances .",
    "those singularities become significant already at distances comparable with the smallest de broglie wavelength probed in nn scattering below pion production threshold .",
    "obviously , any development of nn interactions based on chiral dynamics will presumably require a deeper understanding and proper interpretation of the peculiarities of these highly singular chiral potentials .",
    "although singular potentials where first analyzed many years ago  @xcite ( for an early review see e.g.  @xcite and for a more updated view within an eft context see  @xcite ) , their short distance singular character within the nn interaction has seriously been faced more recently within a renormalization context for the one - pion exchange ( ope ) potential  @xcite and the two - pion exchange ( tpe ) potential  @xcite .    in the np scattering problem",
    "the @xmath0 channel is very special since the scattering length is unnaturally large as compared to the range of the strong interaction , @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , even at zero energy the wave function probes relatively short distance components of the chiral potential  @xcite  \\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the zero energy wave function , fulfilling the asymptotic condition @xmath5 . most of the integrand is located in the region around @xmath6 which is in between ope and tpe ranges . moreover , the low energy theorem of ref .",
    "@xcite allows to write @xmath7 which in the extreme limit @xmath8 yields @xmath9 .",
    "numerically it is found that @xmath10 is far more dependent than @xmath11 and @xmath12 when being evaluated at lo , nlo and nnlo . ] .",
    "higher energies become even more sensitive to short distance interactions . consequently , this channel looks like an ideal place to learn about the size of the most relevant short range corrections to the nn force in the elastic scattering region . actually , in the @xmath0 channel , most eft inspired schemes yield at leading order ( lo ) ( which consists of ope plus a nonderivative counterterm ) an almost constant phase of about @xmath13 around @xmath14 , and an effective range of @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    ", most determinations from partial wave analysis  @xcite and high quality potential models  @xcite yield an almost vanishing phase at this center - of - mass ( cm ) momentum while the experimental effective range is about twice the ope value , @xmath16 .  .",
    "] it is quite unbelievable that such large changes can be reliably accommodated by perturbation theory starting from this lo result despite previous unsuccessful attempts treating ope and tpe perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "actually , for the singlet channel case , short distance components are enhanced due to the large value of the scattering length and the weakness of the ope interaction in this channel .",
    "this is why tpe contributions have been treated with more success in a non - perturbative fashion  @xcite . despite phenomenological agreement with the data",
    ", the inclusion of finite cutoffs suggests that there might be some regulator dependence in those calculations .    in a series of recent papers  @xcite , two of us ( m.p.v . and e.r.a .",
    ") have proposed not only to iterate but also to renormalize to all orders the nn chiral potential within a long distance expansion . by allowing the minimal number of counterterms to yield a finite result , long - distance regulator - independent correlations",
    "are established . in practice ,",
    "the potential must be computed within some power counting scheme .",
    "while the potential is used within weinberg s power counting to lo , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , and next - to - next - to - leading order ( n2lo ) , we only allow for those counterterms which yield a finite and unique scattering amplitude . in the @xmath0 np channel a single energy and momentum independent counterterm @xmath17",
    "is considered which is determined by adjusting the physical scattering length . in the derivation of this result the mathematical requirements of completeness and self - adjointness for the renormalized quantum mechanical problem for a local chiral potential play a decisive role .",
    "this surprising result is in contrast to the standard weinberg counting where an additional counterterm @xmath18 is included already at nlo .",
    "this @xmath18 counterterm could , in fact , be determined by fitting the experimental value of the effective range ; the physics of @xmath18 is to provide a short distance contribution to the effective range in addition to the contribution from the known long distance chiral potential . within this context",
    "it is remarkable that according to ref .",
    "@xcite , where such a short distance contribution vanishes ( or equivalently @xmath19 when the cut - off is removed ) , rather accurate values are _ predicted _ yielding @xmath20 and @xmath21 _",
    "after renormalization_. this latter value is less than @xmath22 larger than the experimentally accepted value and it suggests that most of the effective range is saturated by n2lo tpe contributions and calls for pinning down the remaining discrepancy .",
    "this trend to convergence and agreement is also shared by higher order slope parameters in the effective range expansion without strong need of specific counterterms although there is still room for improvement .",
    "motivated by this encouraging result , one goal of the present paper is to analyze the size of the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n3lo ) corrections to the results found in  @xcite .    the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite exploit explicitly the local character of the chiral potential by conducting the calculations in coordinate space which makes the analysis more transparent .",
    "many results , in particular the conditions under which a renormalized limit exists , can be established a priori analytically .",
    "moreover , the highly oscillatory character of wave functions at short distances is treated numerically using efficient adaptive - step differential equations techniques .",
    "this situation contrasts with momentum space calculations where , with the exception of the pion - less theory , there is a paucity of analytical results , and one must mostly rely on numerical methods .",
    "moreover , the existence of a renormalized limit is not obvious a priori and one may have to resort to some trial and error to search for counterterms .",
    "finally , renormalization conditions are most naturally formulated at zero energy for which the momentum space treatment may be challenging , at times .",
    "of course , besides these technical issues , there is no fundamental difference between proceeding in momentum or coordinate space , particularly _ after _",
    "renormalization , provided the same renormalization conditions are specified , since disparate regulators stemming from either space are effectively removed . indeed , we will check agreement for the phase - shifts determined in different spaces whenever such a comparison becomes possible .",
    "this equivalence is in itself a good motivation for renormalization .",
    "however , at n3lo some unavoidable non - localities appear in the chiral long distance potential .",
    "although they could be treated in configuration space , we adopt here a momentum space treatment .",
    "this will also allow us to answer an intriguing question which was left open in the coordinate space analysis of previous works  @xcite , namely , the role played by the conventional momentum - polynomial representations of the short distance interaction used in most calculations  @xcite in the renormalization problem . more specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that taking @xmath19 was consistent , and a regularization scheme exists where a fixed @xmath18 was irrelevant , but could not discriminate whether @xmath23 was inconsistent as far as it was readjusted to the effective range parameter for any cut - off value .",
    ", becomes irrelevant in the limit @xmath24 ( see below ) .",
    "] in this regard , the present paper yields a definite answer making the surprising agreement of the effective range found in ref .",

    "[ sec : coor - mom ] , we discuss some features of both coordinate and momentum space formulations in the pion - less theory and try to connect the high momentum cutoff @xmath26 with the short distance radial cutoff @xmath25 .",
    "this allows a one - to - one mapping of counterterms in both spaces which will prove useful later on in the pion - full theory .",
    "the identification between the sharp momentum cutoff and the short distance radius found in the pion - less theory is discussed further in appendix  [ sec : nyquist ] in the presence of a long distance potential in the light of the nyquist theorem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : n3lo ] , we come to the central discussion on n3lo corrections to the phase shifts when the scattering amplitude is renormalized with only one short distance counterterm . a wider perspective is achieved by further considering the role of explicit @xmath1-excitations in intermediate states and the subsequent one - counterterm renormalization of the scattering amplitude .",
    "we also discuss the role of three pion exchange as well as how the results depend on the renormalization scheme used to compute the potential based on cut - off independent counterterms .",
    "the mathematical justification for using just one counterterm is provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : weinberg ] where the standard weinberg scheme is pursued both in momentum and coordinate space at nlo and n2lo and shown to potentially have some problems . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] , we summarize our main points .",
    "let us define the scope and goals of the present work .",
    "the standard non - perturbative formulation of the renormalization problem starts with an effective lagrangian or hamiltonian  ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) , from which a certain set of irreducible feynman diagrams ( usually up to a certain order ) is calculated .",
    "these irreducible diagrams are defined to represent a potential @xmath27 .",
    "the potential is then inserted into a scattering equation where it is iterated infinitely many times or , in other words , re - summed non - perturbatively . in the cm frame , where the np kinetic energy is given by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 ,",
    "the scattering process is governed by the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath30 with @xmath27 the potential operator and @xmath31 the resolvent of the free hamiltonian .",
    "the outgoing boundary condition corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "using the normalization @xmath33 one has @xmath34 here @xmath26 means a generic regulator and represents the scale below which all physical effects are taken into account _",
    "explicitly_. the degrees of freedom which are above @xmath26 are taken into account _ implicitly _ by including a suitable cutoff dependence in the potential . the precise equation governing this cutoff dependence",
    "was described and studied in some detail in ref .",
    "@xcite with particular emphasis on infrared fixed points .",
    "we will analyze the cutoff dependence below focusing on the ultraviolet aspects of the interaction .",
    "motivated by the low energy nature of the effective theory , the potential is usually separated into short and long distance components in an _ additive _ form @xmath35 where the long distance contribution is usually given by successive pion exchanges @xmath36 and the short distance component is characterized by a power series expansion in momentum @xmath37 where for simplicity we assume a spin singlet channel  . note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 contribute to s - waves while @xmath38 contributes to p - waves , and so on .",
    "one should face the fact that , although the decomposition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : long - short ] ) is perturbatively motivated and seems quite natural , the additivity between short and long range forces is actually an _ assumption _ which has important consequences , as we will see .  )",
    "does not foresee for instance terms of the form @xmath39 , i.e. terms which are not polynomial but influence the renormalization process .",
    "of course , once additivity is relaxed there are many possible representations , in particular for the short distance components . ]    in principle , for a given regularization scheme characterized by a cutoff @xmath26 , the counterterms @xmath17 , @xmath38 , @xmath18 and so on are determined by fixing some observables .",
    "one naturally expects that the number of renormalization conditions coincides with the number of counterterms in a way that all renormalization conditions are fully uncorrelated .",
    "the statement of uv - renormalizability is that such a procedure becomes always possible when the cutoff @xmath26 is removed by taking the limit @xmath24",
    ". this may not be the case as there may appear redundant contributions ( see the discussion below in sec .",
    "[ sec : coor - mom ] ) meaning that one counterterm or counterterm combination can take any value .",
    "another possible situation is just the opposite ; one may want to impose more renormalization conditions than possible .",
    "in this case some counterterms or counterterm combinations are forbidden . rather than being intricate mathematical pastimes",

    "it is fairly clear that , on physical grounds , one should consider an expansion of the potential that starts at long distance and decreases in range as the number of exchanged particles increases .",
    "note , however , that , while ope is well - defined , the general form of the tpe potential is not uniquely determined . within this context ,",
    "one of the main attractive features of the eft approach has been the definition of a power counting scheme which provides a hierarchy and an _ a priori _ correlation between long and short range physics . in the present paper",

    "a crucial finding of the present paper based on a direct analysis in momentum space is that _ non - perturbative renormalization imposes restrictions _ on the number of terms and form of the short distance potential which depend also on the particular long distance potential .",

    "ideally , one should determine the physically relevant long range regulator independent correlations , i.e. , long distance effects of similar range .",
    "this would amount to consider _ all _ @xmath62 exchange effects on the same footing , since they yield a long distance suppression @xmath63 modulo power corrections . at present , the only way how these long distance potentials can be systematically computed is by dimensional power counting in perturbation theory , as represented schematically in eqs .",

    "regarding eq .",
    "( [ eq : long - short-1s0 ] ) one should stress that the separation between long and short range contributions to the potential is not unique .",
    "in fact , there is a polynomial ambiguity in the long range part which can freely be transferred to the short distance contribution .",
    "however , the non - polynomial part is unambiguous as it is directly related to the left hand cut of the partial wave amplitude which for @xmath65 exchange is located at @xmath66 but presumably becomes incomplete for @xmath67 .   for any non - vanishing radius",
    "( see e.g. the discussion in ref .  @xcite . ) ]      in coordinate space , the problem in the @xmath0 channel is formulated as follows  @xcite .",

    "if we also make an expansion at low energies of the reduced wave function @xmath87 we get the hierarchy of equations @xmath88 and @xmath89 and so on .",

    "this procedure provides by construction the low energy parameters we started with and takes into account that the long range potential determines the form of the wave function at long distances .",
    "the only parameter in the procedure is the short distance radius @xmath25 , which is eventually removed by taking the limit @xmath95 .",
    "one should mention at this point that the coordinate space is particularly suited for the case of local long distance potentials , but the renormalization with an arbitrary number of countertersm requires an _ energy dependent _ but real boundary condition at short distances which eventually violates self - adjointness . on the other hand ,",
    "the momentum space formulation allows the discussion of nonlocal long distance potentials and the renormalization is done in terms of a _ momentum dependent _ short distance polynomial potential .",
    "although this looks like a self - adjoint problem , we will see that in this formulation the counterterms may in fact become complex .",
    "the renormalization of the pion - less theory , i.e. , a set of pure contact interactions , has been treated with great detail in the literature  @xcite although without much consideration on how this problem might be embedded into the wider and certainly more realistic situation where the finite range and short distance singular chiral nn potentials are present .",
    "in fact , much of the understanding of non - perturbative renormalization within the modern nn context has been tailored after those and further studies based on the non - singular ope singlet @xmath0 potential  @xcite plus the standard perturbative experience . in previous  @xcite and in the present work ,",
    "we pursue exactly the opposite goal : we will only consider renormalization procedures which can directly be implemented in the _ presence _ of long distance potentials since , after all , contact nn interactions are always assumed to approximate truly finite range interactions in the long wavelength limit .",
    "thus , it is useful to review here those developments with an eye on the new ingredients which appear in the non - perturbative renormalization of singular pion exchange potentials as analyzed in later sections .",
    "in addition , the deduced running of the counterterms in the contact theory in the infrared domain serves as a useful starting point when the long distance pion exchange potential is switched on .",
    "finally , we will also discuss the size of finite cutoff corrections to the renormalized result depending both on the particular regularization as well as the corresponding representation of the short distance physics .",

    "this fact is clearly seen from inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0-ps - c0-c2-coor.300.eps ] where we plot the phase shifts for a fixed value of the cm momentum @xmath260 as a function of the equivalent sharp momentum cutoff @xmath261 derived for the pion - less theory in sec .",

    "[ fig:1s0-ps - c0-c2-coor.300.eps ] for _ finite cutoffs _ is noteworthy although not completely surprising in the light of the analysis of appendix  [ sec : nyquist ] .",
    "there , the finite cutoff equivalence , @xmath262 , deduced in the contact theory is shown to hold also in the presence of a local potential .    of course",
    ", all these features depend on the singular character of the interaction at short distances and do not depend on the specific form of the potential , so we expect them to hold also when @xmath1 degrees of freedom are explicitly taken into account .",
    "although we can not prove it analytically in momentum space , the remarkable similarity of the coordinate space analysis with the present momentum space calculations strongly suggests that the standard polynomial representation of the short distance potential is _ incompatible _ with renormalization .",
    "of course , this does not preclude the possible existence of a suitable potential representation of the short distance interaction , most likely with complex counterterms , such that both low energy parameters can be fixed and the cutoff can at the same time be removed .",
    "we leave such an interesting investigation for the future .",
    "in the present paper , we have analyzed the renormalization of the singlet np phase shift in the @xmath0 channel incorporating one- and two - pion exchange effects . for the long distance potential , the standard weinberg scheme based on dimensional power counting",
    "is adopted to n3lo .",
    "however , the short distance physics is parameterized in terms of one unique energy and momentum independent counterterm whose cutoff dependence is determined by adjusting the scattering length to its physical value .",
    "the present analysis is carried out in momentum space in a somewhat complementary manner as previously done in coordinate space  @xcite .",
    "actually , we have analyzed and reproduced those results directly in the more popular momentum space after the cutoff has been effectively removed . in order to stress the equivalence of both approaches , we have displayed many results in parallel .",
    "this is not just a stylistic matter of presentation ; besides numerical simplicity , much understanding of the renormalization problem has been achieved by a direct analysis in coordinate space at least for local potentials .",
    "the present work provides a further example in this respect .",
    "the momentum space framework allows a direct extension to include n3lo contributions which include non - local pieces in the long distance chiral potential .",
    "the main outcome of such a calculation is that the n3lo chiral potential induces rather small corrections as compared to the n2lo results in all of the elastic scattering region .",
    "as anticipated previously  @xcite , this happens to be so even when the n3lo potential is more singular than the n2lo one at short distances .",
    "moreover , the analytical scaling behaviour for large cutoffs @xmath26 of the scattering amplitude predicted in a previous coordinate space analysis  @xcite is confirmed qualitatively by the present momentum space calculations ; increasing the order in the expansion of the long distance potential suppresses more the finite cutoff dependence . in summary ,",
    "the scheme is convergent , but differs from the expected phase shifts obtained from partial wave analyses .",
    "an error analysis of the results shows that although there are some uncertainties induced by the input parameters , the corresponding error bands are not large enough to be compatible with the partial wave analysis of the nijmegen group .    the n3lo approximation to the long distance chiral potential",
    "is computed within a heavy baryon expansion and assuming only explicit nucleon degrees of freedom in the nn potential .",
    "this implies in particular that the @xmath220 splitting is considered a non - small parameter .",
    "however , this number is about twice the pion mass , so it is not clear whether such an assumption is fully justified .",
    "therefore , we have analyzed the nn scattering problem when explicit @xmath1 intermediate state excitations are included in the potential .",
    "the net result is that , after renormalization , the @xmath222 and @xmath224 box diagrams contributions mimic extremely accurately the @xmath1-less n2lo and n3lo potentials , respectively , and thus fail to describe the higher energy region of the @xmath0 phase shift .",
    "given the fact that these contributions also fall off at large distances as @xmath263 , this result reinforces the conclusion that there is some shorter range missing physics beyond that provided by tpe .",
    "further , it is interesting to compare the present renormalized results with those obtained for a two pion exchange potential computed within a relativistic baryon framework which sums up all heavy nucleon components  @xcite thus contains a full determination of tpe contributions assuming all other degrees of freedom ( including explicit @xmath1 s ) are infinitely heavy .",
    "there , all np partial waves with @xmath264 are analyzed and for the particular case of the @xmath0 channel the results are rather similar to those found here .",
    "this , again , suppports the present conclusion that , presumably , the components of the nn potential with a shorter range than tpe might finally provide the missing repulsion needed to reduce the @xmath22 overshooting of the @xmath0 effective range as well as the too low value of the phase shift in the region with cm momenta @xmath265 .",
    "we have also investigated the convergence of the standard weinberg counting for both the short distance as well as the long distance potential . at nlo and",
    "n2lo this corresponds to including a polynomial momentum dependence in the short distance interaction by means of two counterterms which may then be fixed by adjusting the scattering length and the effective range to their experimental values .",
    "we find that , with these two renormalization conditions , the counterterms turn out to be complex for not too large cutoffs ( around @xmath266 ) , signaling the breakdown of self - adjointness of the potential , and more generally suggesting a violation of wigner s causality condition . nonetheless , despite phase shifts remaining real , a unique renormalized limit does not exist .",
    "this lack of convergence agrees with similar findings in coordinate space anticipated in ref .",
    "the physical understanding of the situation is as follows . on the one hand the long range physics",
    "is fixed , thus , the off - shell propagation within the long range region is unambiguous . on the other hand",
    ", the short range potential must be adjusted to provide the threshold parameters such as the scattering length , the effective range etc .",
    "if the short range potential is just determined from fixing the scattering length only , this is at zero energy and becomes zero range when the cutoff is removed , so there is no off - shell ambiguity .",
    "in contrast , fixing further the effective range requires non - zero energy and there are in fact infinitely many ways of parameterizing this , with different off - shell behaviour even when the cutoff is removed .",
    "in other words , fixing a finite range and removing the cutoff depends on details of the method .",
    "these conflicts between off - shellness and finiteness are not new in field theory .",
    "green s functions which are renormalized on - shell do not necessarily provide finite off - shell amplitudes .",
    "the standard weinberg parameterization as a polynomial in momenta is one choice which may not turn out to be consistent with renormalizability . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to mention that coordinate space detailed studies based on renormalization group properties  @xcite suggest the existence of a suitable short distance representation yielding convergent results in theories with more than one counterterm .",
    "the generalization of those results to momentum space would require an in - depth study of the renormalization group in the presence of eventually nonlocal but singular potentials .",
    "we note that the energy dependence of the coordinate space solution violates self - adjointness explicitly and we expect that most likely an energy independent non - polynomial momentum space solution would spoil self - adjointness as well .",
    "it is important to note that with a finite cutoff and four counterterms the @xmath0 phase shift has been successfully described within the standard weinberg counting  @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "it is natural to question the usefulness of taking the infinite cutoff limit and to carry out a renormalization process . from a physical point of view",
    "the limit @xmath42 corresponds to consider other degrees of freedom than those not considered explicitly to be infinitely heavy .",
    "thus , the aim of the renormalization program is far more stringent than previous finite cutoff calculations .",
    "within such a framework any failure can be unambiguously attributed to missing physical information on the long distance potential , and the renormalization process highlights this in a rather vivid manner as one clearly sees when going from ope to tpe potentials . from a mathematical perspective the renormalizability requirement imposes tight constraints on the admissible forms of the short distance physics for some given long distance interactions .",
    "these are powerful conditions which have traditionally been the great strength of the renormalization ideas to avoid unnecessary proliferation of interactions .",
    "since the power counting of long distance potentials is not uniquely determined yet ( one may e.g. include or not explicit @xmath1 s ) , it would be very helpful to see what kind of short distance constraints on those potentials might be imposed as well on the basis of renormalizability or other principles .",
    "the problems with the weinberg counting for the short distance polynomial form in the momenta of the interaction with renormalization found in this paper for nlo and n2lo is to be added to the other ones noted in previous works @xcite . on the mathematical side ,",
    "it is noticeable that the coordinate space analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite conjectured this result by exploiting the compelling requirement of completeness and self - adjointness for the renormalized quantum mechanical problem for a local chiral potential which at first sight may seem completely germane concepts to the eft machinery . on the phenomenological side",
    ", it should be noted that this inconsistency result does not explain why the renormalized phase shift with just one counterterm comes out reasonably close to the accepted ones , but certainly makes this unique and finite prediction more credible and inevitable from a theoretical perspective if self - adjointness is maintained , and provides further confidence on the virtues of a renormalization principle within the chiral approach to the nn interaction .",
