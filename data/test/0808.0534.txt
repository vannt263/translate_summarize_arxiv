    "the search for the last unobserved particle of the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs boson , has been a major goal of high energy physics for many years , and is a central part of fermilab s tevatron program .",
    "direct searches at the cern lep collider have set a 95% c.l .",
    "limit on the higgs boson mass of @xmath6  gev  @xcite .",
    "taking into account this limit , precision electroweak measurements indirectly constrain the sm higgs boson mass to be lower than 190  gev at the 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite , which is within reach of the fermilab tevatron collider experiments .",
    "previous cdf and results on higgs searches were combined in the tevatron higgs combination presented in april 2008  @xcite .",
    "both cdf and have recently reported new and updated searches for the sm higgs boson  @xcite-@xcite and their combination  @xcite .    in this note , we combine the most recent results of all such searches in  collisions at  which are sensitive to a high mass ( 155 - 200 gev / c@xmath3 ) higgs : the searches for a sm higgs boson decaying to @xmath7 pairs ( the @xmath8 s then decaying leptonically ) and produced through gluon - gluon fusion ( ) , vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , or in association with vector bosons ( and @xmath9 with hadronic @xmath10 decays ) in data corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3.0  at cdf and 3.0  at d . to simplify their combination ,",
    "the searches are separated into mutually exclusive final states ( see table  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analyses '' in this note .",
    "selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and are briefly described below .",
    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d  analyses . for the  analyses , a large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons ( any combination of electrons or muons )",
    "are selected , defining three final states ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ) for d .",
    "cdf separates the  events into five non - overlapping samples , first by separating the events by jet multiplicity ( 0 , 1 or 2 ) , then subdviding the 0 and 1 jet samples in two , one having a low signal / bacgkround ( s / b ) ratio , the other having a higher one .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents reconstruction of the higgs boson mass , so other variables have to be used for separating signal from background . in these analyses ,",
    "the final discriminants are neural - network outputs based on several kinematic variables  @xcite .",
    "these include likelihoods constructed from matrix - element probabilities as input to the neural network , for cdf .",
    "all analyses in these channels have been updated with more data and analysis improvements compared to our previous combination  @xcite .",
    "the cdf and d  experiments also contribute  analyses , where the associated @xmath8 boson and the @xmath8 boson from the higgs boson decay which has the same charge are required to decay leptonically , thereby defining like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) containing all decays of the third @xmath8 boson . in these analyses ,",
    "cdf derive the limits from a counting experiment , while for dthe final variable is a likelihood discriminant formed from several topological variables .",
    "higgs boson signals ( gluon - gluon fusion , vector boson production , or associated production with vector bosons ) are simulated using pythia  @xcite , and cteq6l  @xcite parton distribution functions at leading - order ( lo ) .",
    "the signal cross sections are normalized to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculations  @xcite , and branching ratios from hdecay  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 production cross section is also corrected for two - loop electroweak corrections  @xcite .    for both cdf and d , events from multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds ( `` qcd production '' )",
    "are measured in data with different methods , in orthogonal samples . for cdf ,",
    "backgrounds from other sm processes were generated using pythia , alpgen  @xcite , mc@nlo  @xcite and herwig  @xcite programs .",
    "for d , these backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep  @xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations from mcfm  @xcite .",
    "integrated luminosities , and references to the collaborations public documentation for each analysis are given in table  [ tab : cdfacc ] for cdf and in table  [ tab : dzacc ] for d .",
    "the tables include the ranges of higgs boson mass ( @xmath18 ) over which the searches were performed , but the combination presented in this note is performed only for search of higgs bosons with mass of 155 gev / c@xmath3 or above .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig : combollr-2 ] the 1-@xmath22 distribution as a function of the higgs boson mass , which is directly interpreted as the level of exclusion of our search .",
    "for instance , both our observed and expected results exclude a higgs boson with @xmath23 165 gev/@xmath5 at @xmath24 92% c.l .",
