    "quantization of classical chaotic systems has long been of interest because of the challenges in identifying quantum signatures of systems that , in a classical limit , exhibit chaotic behavior .",
    "various signatures have been identified , such as the spectral properties of the generating hamiltonian  @xcite , phase space scarring  @xcite , hypersensitivity to perturbation  @xcite , and fidelity decay  @xcite , which indicate an underlying chaotic presence in the quantum dynamics . here",
    ", we investigate the issue of quantum signatures from the perspective of entanglement : as entanglement is at the heart of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for quantum information processing  @xcite , the entanglement inherent in quantum chaotic systems could provide a valuable approach to studying decoherence and quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quantum chaos could be seen as an engine for generating entanglement ; indeed quantum chaos could lurk in quantum information processing  @xcite as a deleterious or perhaps even as an advantageous effect .",
    "we study entanglement by considering a finite multipartite system , whose collective dynamics obey chaotic hamiltonian dynamics in the classical limit .    previous studies of entanglement in chaotic systems  @xcite have explored bipartite entanglement in pure states , entanglement of qubits in a multiqubit system and average entanglement or entangling power . in this study",
    "we explore these different types of entanglement in a single simple system , namely the quantum kicked top  ( qkt )  @xcite .",
    "this enables us to compare the degree to which these different types of entanglement display signatures of chaos .",
    "an advantage of the dynamics of the qkt is that it obeys a spin algebra symmetry .",
    "this spin system can thus be regarded as a composite of distinct spin - half particles thereby admitting a multiqubit interpretation .",
    "our system thus allows us to study and compare pairwise entanglement between two qubits as well as bipartite entanglement between the two qubits and the rest of the qubits .",
    "the hilbert space for the qkt is finite and the poincar section of the phase space compact , allowing analyses of quantum and classical dynamics uncomplicated by truncation issues .",
    "the qkt is well studied and understood thereby simplifying the analysis of the role of entanglement in the system . finally , the qkt possesses a parity symmetry that allows coherent quantum tunnelling to occur for states localized at classical fixed points  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian evolution may increase the entanglement of the multipartite system , initiated in a collective spin coherent state  @xcite .",
    "for this analysis it suffices to employ two entanglement measures . for bipartite entanglement , where the multipartite system is divided into two subsystems , entropy of a subsystem",
    "is used to quantify the degree of entanglement between the two subsystems .",
    "pairwise entanglement , on the other hand , considers the degree of entanglement between two qubits traced over all remaining qubits and is quantified by the concurrence  @xcite .",
    "we present general results for both bipartite and pairwise entanglement in the multipartite qkt and demonstrate that these entanglement measures reveal strong signatures of the classical chaos features corresponding to the onset of chaos and to the edge of chaos  @xcite , which is the boundary between regular and chaotic regimes in the classical phase space .",
    "we have studied the behavior of the linear entropy and the concurrence for specific initial states as well as the dynamics of these quantities when averaged over all initial states .",
    "we show that the linear entropy increases more rapidly for an initial state centered in a chaotic region of the classical phase space than one centered on a fixed point .",
    "this agrees with the behavior of the linear entropy observed in other chaotic systems , supporting the conjecture that classical chaos can enhance bipartite entanglement  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that the pairwise entanglement as measured by the concurrence also reveals a dramatic change for a spin coherent state whose mean traverses the edge of chaos on its transit through chaotic and regular regions of the phase space .",
    "contrary to the linear entropy , the concurrence rapidly decreases for an initial state located in the chaotic region .",
    "while the linear entropy and concurrence can reveal the local chaotic and regular structures in phase space , the entangling power , which is the averaged bipartite or pairwise entanglement , can be used to identify the edge of chaos and quantify the onset of global chaos , much like the classical lyapunov exponent .",
    "we show that the entangling power greatly increases as the chaoticity parameter  @xmath0 is increased , and the corresponding classical kicked top makes the transition from predominantly regular to predominantly chaotic behavior . in particular",
    ", the behavior of the average linear entropy is qualitatively similar to that of the classical lyapunov exponent , thus revealing a signature of a global feature of the classical chaos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the qkt and its classical dynamics , and introduce bipartite and pairwise entanglement measures . in sec .",
    "iii , we study in detail dynamical evolutions of bipartite and pairwise entanglement , and examine the edge of quantum chaos , the onset of quantum chaos via the entangling power . we conclude in sec .",
    "the qkt is described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 are spin operators and states are restricted to irrep @xmath3 for which @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the duration between periodic kicks , @xmath6 is the strength of each kick ( which is manifested as a turn by angle @xmath6 ) , and @xmath0 is the strength of the twist .",
    "the hamiltonian is an alternative sequence of twists ( @xmath7 term ) and turns ( @xmath8 term ) .",
    "the qkt describes a spin system , which can be comprised of multiple systems of lower spins . for @xmath9 the pauli operators for the @xmath10 qubit , a collective spin operator , satisfying the usual su(2 ) algebra ,",
    "is given by @xmath11 an example of using multiple qubits to simulate the qkt has been presented for trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "a standard dynamical description of the qkt is via the floquet operator @xmath12 where the energy is rescaled so that @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are henceforth assumed .",
    "the orthogonal eigenstates of @xmath15 , denoted by @xmath16 , which satisfy @xmath17 provide a convenient basis for stroboscopic evolution .",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath18 evolves to @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the qkt  @xcite is chaotic in the classical limit . for integrable systems ,",
    "it is well known from semi - classical theory that the classical actions can be associated with corresponding regular eigenstates of the quantum system with a well defined quantum number .",
    "this correspondence breaks down in chaotic systems  @xcite . in quasi - integrable systems with a mixed classical phase space of regular and chaotic regions , some of the eigenstates",
    "can still be associated with local actions in the regular regions with corresponding discrete eigenenergies .",
    "the remaining eigenstates result in an irregular energy spectrum corresponding to the chaotic region  @xcite .",
    "we show here that this underlying regular and chaotic energy spectrum of the floquet eigenstates of the qkt is reflected in the dynamics of the entanglement , depending on whether the initial state is in the regular or chaotic region of the classical phase space .",
    "the classical limit of the qkt is obtained by expressing @xmath21 and similar for @xmath22 and @xmath23 and factorizing all moments such as @xmath24 to products of first - order moments .",
    "then the classical equations of motion , obtained from the heisenberg operator equations of motion and applying the factorization rule above , are given by  @xcite @xmath25 the stroboscopic evolution described by eq.([map ] ) can be represented in a phase space given by a sphere @xmath26 of unit radius .",
    "the classical , normalized angular momentum variables @xmath27 can be parametrized in polar coordinates as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the polar and azimuthal angles , respectively .",
    "thus the mapping domain is essentially two - dimensional .",
    "the stroboscopic dynamics of the classical map is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the plot , we choose the chaoticity parameter @xmath31 which yields a mixture of regular and chaotic areas of significant size .",
    "elliptic fixed points surrounded by the chaotic sea are evident .",
    "two such elliptic fixed points have coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath33 as we will see , this phase space structure of the classical kicked top determines behavior of quantum entanglement in the qkt .",
    "three hundred stroboscopic trajectories are plotted , each for a duration of 300 kicks.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      pure - state bipartite entanglement has been calculated in previous studies that explore connections between quantum entanglement and underlying classical chaos  @xcite .",
    "quite recently , bettelli and shepelyansky  @xcite studied the behavior of the concurrence in a system exhibiting quantum chaos , and found that the underlying classical chaos leads to exponential decrease of the concurrence down to some residual values .",
    "this result shows that the concurrence is very sensitive to the onset of chaos , and understanding entanglement of these systems may help to control quantum chaos and suppress its negative effects in quantum information processing .",
    "we consider bipartite entanglement between a pair of qubits selected from a symmetric multi - qubit state and the rest of the system , as well as pairwise entanglement between the two qubits .",
    "once we obtain the two - qubit reduced density matrix , the entanglement can be readily calculated . by expressing the reduced density matrix @xmath34 for qubit 1 and 2 in terms of the expectation values of the collective operators , all elements of @xmath34",
    "are conveniently obtained  @xcite .",
    "our system governed by the qkt hamiltonian is a composite system , and remains in a pure state at all times if we initially choose a pure state . for pure states ,",
    "bipartite entanglement is well - defined and can be quantified by entropies of either subsystem . for convenience ,",
    "we adopt the linear entropy as the entanglement measure , which is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the reduced density matrix for the first subsystem .",
    "the maximum linear entropy for a pure state of a bipartite @xmath37 system , is given by @xmath38 .",
    "while we may choose other entropies such as the von neumann entropy as our entanglement measure , the qualitative results are in general independent of choice of entropies for pure states . moreover , the linear entropy and the von neumann entropy are two limiting cases of the rnyi entropy  @xcite , they are thus interrelated and one can be used to estimate the other  @xcite .",
    "given our @xmath39-qubit system , we consider another type of entanglement , the pairwise entanglement , i.e. , the entanglement between a pair of qubits .",
    "when @xmath40 , the pair of qubits can be in a mixed state . entanglement for a mixed state @xmath41",
    "is quantified by the entanglement of formation .",
    "specifically , for a pair of qubits , entanglement is equivalent to the non - positivity of the partially transposed density matrix  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can use the concurrence  @xcite to quantify the pairwise entanglement .",
    "the concurrence is defined as @xmath42with the quantities @xmath43 being the square roots of the eigenvalues in descending order of the matrix product @xmath44 @xmath45 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath34 .",
    "the value of the concurrence ranges from zero for an unentangled state to unity for a maximally entangled state .",
    "we present here our studies of the entanglement dynamics of our @xmath39-qubit system governed by the qkt  ( [ top ] ) , with the relevant angular momentum operators @xmath46 given by the collective operators .",
    "if we choose the initial pure state to be symmetric under exchange of any qubits , then the state vector at any later time is also symmetric .",
    "thus , we can describe the state of the @xmath39-qubit system in terms of the orthonormal basis @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "the states @xmath49 are the usual symmetric dicke states  @xcite .",
    "state @xmath50 is not entangled , whereas state @xmath51 , the so - called w state  @xcite , is pairwise entangled with concurrence @xmath52 .    to connect the quantum and classical dynamics of the kicked top , we choose the initial state to be",
    "the spin coherent state ( scs ) @xmath53 , with  @xcite @xmath54\\}.\\]]mean of @xmath55 is @xmath56 the initial scs can be rewritten as a multi - qubit product state , and thus exhibits no entanglement ( zero linear entropy and concurrence ) .",
    "we start by exploring the dynamics of entanglement for initial states with a mean value in four different regions of the phase space , specifically a fixed point , an integrable ( or kam ) region , a chaotic region , and the border between the integrable and the chaotic region known as ` the edge of chaos '  @xcite .",
    "we are also interested in the behavior as the chaoticity parameter @xmath0 is varied .",
    "we start with the choice @xmath57 , which exhibits large integrable and large chaotic regions , and we select four states localized in the four regions mentioned earlier .    for convenience",
    "we fix @xmath58 and vary @xmath59 : this ` line of latitude ' on @xmath26 includes all four regions we are exploring .",
    "an elliptic fixed point arises at @xmath60 , a point in the regular region occurs at @xmath61 , one edge of chaos can be seen at @xmath62 , and a point well in the chaotic sea is located at @xmath63 .",
    "the states with means at each of these @xmath64 points in the phase space are chosen to be scss .",
    "these states are minimum uncertainty states and are well localized around the four chosen points in phase space .     for @xmath31 and @xmath65.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "we numerically compute bipartite entanglement between two qubits and the other @xmath66 qubits , and display the numierical results in fig .  2 as linear entropy versus time increasing parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we observe that the entanglement is enhanced for the initial state centered in the chaotic region after a short time .",
    "initially , the linear entropy is zero , and as the dynamics evolve , the entropy increases slowly when the wave packet is centered in the regular region , whereas it exhibits a rapid rise when centered in the chaotic region .",
    "the curve with @xmath68 displays the intermediate behavior .",
    "furthermore , the entanglement for the state initially with mean at a fixed point displays a periodic modulation that is absent in the evolution of the entanglement for the state initiated in the chaotic region .",
    "this periodic modulation is an indicator of the underlying regular classical dynamics and corresponding regular energy spectrum of the floquet eigenstates  @xcite .        ) .",
    "the other parameters are the same as those of fig .",
    "2 . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure 3 shows the dynamical behavior of the concurrence . just as in the linear entropy case",
    ", we see a rapid change in the concurrence for a state initially centered in the chaotic sea . however , our numerical results suggest that the initial state centered in the fixed point will lead to large pairwise entanglement production , which is opposite to the case of the bipartite pure - state entanglement production , in which the classical chaos enhances the production of bipartite entanglement . of particular interest",
    "are the collapses and revivals in the evolution of the concurrence for a state centered on the fixed point .",
    "figure 3 ( left - up one ) shows a revival at @xmath69 .",
    "additional revivals occur at @xmath70 , @xmath71 and so on . for the chaotic case",
    ", we can not observe the revival phenomenon .",
    "this quasiperiodic behavior in the regular region indicates that the scs in the regular region has a finite support over the basis set of regular floquet eigenstates .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the long - time behaviors of the concurrence for the regular case , and observe multiple collapse and revivals . at long times",
    "the revivals become sparse , and finally the concurrence reduces to zero .",
    "we see that the concurrence is very sensitive to quantum chaos , which is consistent with the observations of bettelli and shepelyansky  @xcite in their studies of concurrence between qubits during the operation of an efficient multiqubit quantum algorithm .",
    "however , unlike their system in which the concurrence reached a finite residual value , in our qkt model , the concurrence disappears at very long times ; the difference arises because we assumes symmetrised multi - qubit states , whereas bettelli and shepelyansky allow this symmetry to be broken .",
    "the edge of chaos  @xcite is an important issue in the study of quantum chaos . in classical chaos ,",
    "the edge of chaos is a fractal boundary separating the regular and chaotic regions .",
    "however , this fine - grained fractal structure does not translate well into the quantum domain . recently",
    ", it was found that the edge of chaos is characterized by a power law decrease in the overlap between a state evolved under chaotic dynamics and the same state evolved under a slightly perturbed dynamics  @xcite . here",
    ", we study the edge of quantum chaos from the perspective of entangling powers , which are defined to be either the maximal or the mean entanglement that the evolution operator can generate over all initial states  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , given a fixed initial state , we may ask what is the maximal and the mean entanglement that the operator can generate over all time . in general state - averaging and time - averaging are inequivalent and so the two methods yield different results .    in strongly chaotic systems ,",
    "the two definitions converge due to nearly ergodic dynamics . in this study , we explore both the entanglement averaged over all time as well as the entanglement averaged over initial states .",
    "we begin our analysis with the average over time . in practice , for numerical purposes we consider a finite time domain .",
    "we define time - averaged entanglement power as the average linear entropy or average concurrence over a time interval @xmath72 ( which should be much longer than other time scales ) as follows : @xmath73 for local unitary operations , the above quantities are necessarily zero .    .",
    "the mean linear entropy is plotted for @xmath74 ( solid line ) , @xmath65 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath75 ( dotted line ) ; the mean concurrence is plotted for @xmath75 ( solid line ) , @xmath76 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath77 ( dotted line ) .",
    "parameters @xmath78 and @xmath0 are set to @xmath79 and @xmath57 . the time average is over 200 steps , and the subplots below are partly enlarged versions of above ones.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we fix the polar angle @xmath79 of the scs as before , and vary the azimuthal angle @xmath30 from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "the center of the scs wave packet thus commences in the chaotic region and passes through two regular islands .",
    "figure 5 displays the time - averaged mean linear entropy @xmath82and mean concurrence @xmath83 as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath59 .",
    "when the azimuthal angle goes from @xmath80 to the first regular region , the linear entropy decreases until it reaches a minimum which approximately corresponds to the fixed point @xmath84 .",
    "subsequently the mean entropy increases to a flat larger area corresponding to the chaotic region .",
    "in contrast to the behavior of the mean linear entropy , the mean concurrence reaches a maximum approximately at the fixed point .",
    "when @xmath30 increases from @xmath85 , the mean concurrence first decreases slowly , and then exhibits an abrupt increase to a maximal value .",
    "thos turning point sharply displays the edge of chaos .",
    "another turning point is obvious from the figure .",
    "we also observe that the larger the number of qubits , the wider the regular region . in the large @xmath39 limit",
    ", the regular region will coincide with that of corresponding classical chaos of fig .  1 .",
    "we further calculate the mean linear entropy and the mean concurrence as a function of @xmath78 and @xmath59 .",
    "the contour plots are shown in figs .  4 and 5 .",
    "comparing figs .  1 and 4 , we observe that these two figures closely match each other .",
    "specifically , the four islands of fig .  4 are evident , reflecting the four stable islands in the classical phase space . comparing figs .  1 and 5 , the four stable islands of fig .  1 closely match those of fig .  5 .",

    ".  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 and time average is over 50 kicks.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the previous section , the time - averaged entanglement revealed clearly whether the initial state was in the regular or chaotic region . here , we are concerned with global properties of a chaotic system . for classical systems ,",
    "the onset of global chaos can be quantified by calculating the global lyapunov exponent . here",
    "we define the following entangling power to quantify the onset of global quantum chaos : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the haar measure . like the global classical lyapunov exponent ,",
    "this state - averaged entangling power characterizes global properties of the qkt .",
    "the entangling power characterizes the entangling capability of the @xmath0-dependent floquet operator .",
    "figure 8 shows the entangling powers and the lyapunov exponent versus parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that when @xmath91 , the entangling power @xmath92 exhibits a rapid increase and saturates beyond @xmath93 .",
    "the rapid increase of the entangling power signifies the onset of quantum chaos , and the saturation implies that global chaos has occurred . between @xmath94 and @xmath95 ,",
    "when there are still regions of regular islands in the chaotic phase space , a mixture of regular and chaotic behavior is expected . in contract to @xmath92 , @xmath86 becomes very small for @xmath96 , which is also an indicator of onset of quantum chaos .",
    "note that @xmath86 has a peak which results from the competition between the entangling power of the qkt floquet operator and the inherent chaos . on one hand , increasing @xmath0 will enhance the entangling power , and on the other hand , the inherent quantum chaos suppresses the pairwise entangling power , thus leading to the peak . for @xmath92 , increase of @xmath0 and the quantum chaos both enhance the linear entropy , and thus no competition exists and no peak appears",
    "we have investigated a multi - qubit system whose collective hamiltonian dynamics are chaotic in the classical limit .",
    "we studied the particular example of the quantum kicked top , which is a well - studied example of quantum chaos with the advantages of having a finite - dimensional hilbert space ( thereby obviating the need for truncation that arises in infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces ) and of involving only spin operators of no more than quadratic order .",
    "although the collective dynamics are well understood , the underlying entanglement of the qubits that collectively make up the quantum kicked top is only just beginning to be understood . here",
    "we have developed methods for studying the quantum kicked top , and these methods are applicable to more general systems .",
    "we have identified bipartite and pairwise entanglement as two quite distinct measures to determine the entanglement in the system , and we have related the dynamics of these measures of entanglement to chaotic features of the quantum kicked top in the classical limit ; as examples , we have connected the features of the entanglement evolution to local properties such as whether the state is supported predominantly in the regular or chaotic region and also to global properties such as showing that entangling power averaged over states grows similarly to the global lyapunov exponent growth for the classical chaotic system .",
    "we have assumed symmetric multi - qubit states throughout , and the entanglement properties studied here reflect this assumption . if the symmetrization condition is broken , different dynamics can be expected .",
    "for example , bettelli and shepelyanski  @xcite show a concurrence that reaches a residual steady - state value .",
    "they explain this non - zero residue as being a result of symmetry breaking in their system .",
    "in contrast , our system exhibits a decay of concurrence to zero .",
    "the assumption of symmetric states implies indistinguishability of the qubits .",
    "thus even though entanglement may exist in the system , it may not be accessible as a useful tool for quantum information processing due to inherent inability to distinguish between the qubits .",
    "an alternative measure of entanglement could be an operational measure that takes into account physical restrictions on accessibility of the entanglement due to symmetries of the system  @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "our work highlights the connection between entanglement of a multi - qubit state whose collective dynamics is chaotic in the classical limit and introduces valuable methods and measures for studying this entanglement .",
    "it would be worthwhile to investigate other quantum chaotic systems using concepts of time - averaging and global entangling power .",
    "furthermore , it would interesting to define and compare systems in which the symmetrization results hold to systems where this symmetrization condition is broken .",
