    "improved maps in several transitions were obtained by nanten ( 2.7  resolution , but routinely undersampled ) : @xcite published @xmath4co  maps of the whole complex , mostly sampled at 8   spacing , with some areas at 4  spacing ; @xmath0co  10 maps @xcite cover lupus  i and iii with 8  spacing , while c@xmath5o   10 maps @xcite cover all the clouds in the complex at 2   spacing .",

    ".    the large - scale structure of the lupus clouds can be traced by near - ir extinction @xcite and co 10 emission @xcite .",
    "the complex covers some 20  of galactic latitude ( about 50  pc ) . at low latitudes ( @xmath8 ) , a large mass of diffuse gas contains denser filamentary clouds ; at higher latitudes , the dense clouds ( lupus i and ii ) are more clearly separated .",
    "the evolution of the lupus clouds may have been driven by the influence of nearby ob stars @xcite .",
    "the lupus and ophiuchus molecular clouds face one another across the upper - scorpius subgroup of the scorpius - centaurus ob association ; the upper - centaurus - lupus subgroup lies on the opposite side of the lupus clouds from upper - sco .",
    "the shell around upper - sco , blown by stellar winds and a presumed supernova 1.5myr ago @xcite , borders the ne side of the lupus clouds ; on the plane of the sky , the ridge which dominates lupus  i ( b228 , see below ) lies just on the trailing edge of the shell .",
    "the much older upper - cen - lup subgroup has driven an shell far beyond the lupus clouds @xcite ; it should have passed through the lupus complex some 47 myr ago , roughly consistent with the ages of t  tauri stars in lupus iii and iv @xcite .",

    "lupus  iv thus appears to have less ( or no ) ongoing star formation , compared to lupus  i and iii .",

    "lupus i , iii , and iv were observed with the antarctic submillimeter telescope and remote observatory ( ast / ro , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , during the period 2005 march ",
    "november , in the 461ghz co 43 and 220ghz @xmath0co  21 transitions .",
    "the telescope , receiver , and spectrometer systems are described by @xcite : @xmath0co  21 observations used the 230ghz sis receiver , whose local oscillator system has been upgraded to use a synthesizer , frequency multiplied ( @xmath13 ) by a millitech multiplier .",
    "co 43 observations used the 450495ghz sis waveguide receiver @xcite .",
    "low - resolution acousto - optical spectrometers ( aoss , 1ghz bandwidth , 0.7mhz channel width ) were used for all observations .",
    "the large - scale maps presented in this paper were built up from multiple smaller maps ( ` submaps ' ) , mosaicked together as follows : each submap was centered on a point of a large - scale grid superimposed on the molecular cloud , the grid points separated by 24  and 12  for the 21 and 43 observations respectively .",
    "the submaps measure @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 respectively , giving substantial overlap between neighbouring 21 maps and some overlap ( one row or column of spectra ) between neighbouring 43 maps .",
    "the submaps use cell sizes of 1  and 0.5 , significantly oversampling the telescope beam ( 3.3  at 220ghz , 1.7  at 461ghz ) .",
    "the spectra are position switched , taken in batches of 4 or 5 , all of which share a reference measurement , about a degree away .",
    "the 4 or 5 source spectra are all at the same declination ( and hence at the same elevation , since ast / ro lies at the south geographic pole ) , but the reference position is the same for all spectra in a submap , and may thus differ in elevation from the source spectra by as much as a few arcminutes .",
    "the use of one reference position for each submap , however , allows the reference position to be checked for emission .",
    "each row of each submap is built up from a number of contiguous blocks of reference - sharing spectra .",
    "reference sharing increases the observing efficiency almost to that of on - the - fly mapping , but also shares one of its weaknesses : the sharing of a reference spectrum produces correlated noise in neighboring spectra , which can show up as artifacts in the map . rather than the long stripes characteristic of on - the - fly mapping",
    ", correlated noise is manifested in the ast / ro maps as short ( 4- or 5-cell ) horizontal blocks .",
    "the ast / ro observing system produces spectra calibrated onto the @xmath17  scale @xcite ; because of the unobstructed off - axis optical design of the telescope , this is essentially equivalent to @xmath18 .",
    "further reduction and processing were carried out ( using comb , the standard ast / ro data reduction programmpound / comb ] , and pdl ) .",
    "the spectra have velocity resolutions of 0.9kms@xmath1  ( @xmath0co  21 ) and 0.4kms@xmath1  ( co 43 ) ; they were checked for frequency shifts , and corrections were applied ( corrections ranged from 0 to almost 5kms@xmath1   see appendix  [ app - data ] ) .",
    "linear baselines were subtracted from all spectra , along with polynomial baselines if necessary : a few percent of the 43 spectra required non - linear baseline subtraction , and almost none of the 21 spectra ( table  [ tab - spectra ] ) .",
    "long - integration spectra were taken toward all reference positions , generally showing upper limits of @xmath19k ( @xmath0co  21 ) and @xmath20  k ( co 43 ) .",
    "some 21 reference positions ( for one submap in lupus  i and one in lupus  iii ) contained substantial emission ( @xmath21k ) , and these reference spectra were added back into all the spectra in the relevant submap .",
    "because of the overlap between submaps , there are over a thousand pointings on the sky toward which two or more spectra were measured at different times .",
    "these duplicate pointings can be used to estimate the internal consistency of the flux calibration at the telescope .",
    "distributions of the ratios of peak @xmath18  between spectra with the same pointings are shown in figure  [ fig - peakratio ] for both 43 and 21 data .",
    "the typical inconsistencies between these spectra ( estimated by the standard deviation of the distributions of @xmath18  ratios ) are about 30% for co 43 data , and about 20% for @xmath0co  21 .",
    "initial map making was carried out by nearest - neighbor sampling the submap data onto one large grid , with overlapping observations co - added .",
    "each pixel of these maps corresponds directly to the spectrum observed by the telescope ; without smoothing , inconsistencies between neighbouring submaps show up as clear edges , which are much more obvious in the 43 than in the 21 data .",
    "the overlap between submaps allowed these inconsistencies in the 43 data to be checked and corrected .",
    "individual submaps with significantly different flux scales to their surroundings were identified and rescaled .",
    "these rescalings were checked visually : a submap was only rescaled if it was obviously higher or lower than its neighbours , if the measured scaling was consistent with the visual one , and if the rescaling improved the appearance of the map when it was applied .",
    "rescaling corrections of @xmath22% did not significantly improve the appearance of the map , and were not implemented .",
    "fewer than half the submaps needed correction , mostly by factors of 0.71.4 ( in line with the estimate of internal consistency given above ) , and the largest correction factor was @xmath23 .",
    "no corrections needed to be applied to the 21 data . the need to rescale probably arises from imperfect estimation of the atmospheric transparency in the calibration procedure , which works better when the atmosphere is fairly optically thin ( e.g.  at 220  ghz ) than at higher opacities ( e.g. , at 461  ghz ) .",
    "the corrected 43 data ( and uncorrected 21 data ) were then gridded ( as above ) to produce final unsmoothed data cubes , which were used to generate the maps in this paper .",
    "all the quantities mapped are calculated directly from the data , without profile - fitting .",
    "for example , the line width is estimated by the ratio of integrated intensity to peak @xmath18  ( which overestimates the fwhm by about 10% if applied to a perfect gaussian line ) .",
    "sample spectra from the data cubes are shown in figures  [ fig - spectra - lui][fig - spectra - luiv ] .",
    "integrated intensity maps ( figures  [ fig - lui - int][fig - luiv - int ] ) , channel maps ( integrated over 2  kms@xmath1  channels , figures  [ fig - lui - chan][fig - luiv - chan ] ) , and peak @xmath18  maps ( figures  [ fig - lui - tmax][fig - luiv - tmax ] ) were all produced by bessel smoothing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gives the ` most fair ' representation of the sky as observed by a single - dish telescope .",
    "however , if significant emission extends to the edge of the map , this technique tends to produce a roll - off of emission in the outermost pixels of the map , and this effect is visible in some of the lupus maps . the effective telescope diameter was picked to balance resolution against noise : 1.5 m for the 21 maps , and 1.2 m for the 43 , yielding overall beam sizes of 3.8  and 2.3 , respectively .",
    "maps of the velocity centroid ( figures  [ fig - lui - vcen][fig - luiv - vcen ] ) and line width ( figures  [ fig - lui - lwid][fig - luiv - lwid ] ) use both unsmoothed data ( in grayscale ) and gaussian - smoothed data ( contours ) , with gaussian fwhms of 5  ( 21 ) and 5.75  ( 43 ) yielding overall beams of 6  in both transitions .",
    "the nominal pointing accuracy of ast / ro is about 1 , but comparison of the @xmath0co  21 map of lupus  iv with the optical extinction structure ( see  figure  [ fig - luiv - opt ] ) suggests a systematic offset in declination .",
    "discrepancies of similar magnitude can be seen in other ast / ro data from 2005 @xcite .",
    "the lupus  iv maps have therefore all been shifted southwards by 1.5 .",
    "the submillimeter map is well correlated with the millimeter - wave one , and so it has been shifted as well .",
    "there is no evidence of similar systematic shifts in the lupus  i or lupus  iii data .",
    "the publicly available data cubes _ do not _ have this shift applied to them .",
    "@xcite estimated c@xmath5o  10 optical depths in the range 0.10.5 toward extinction peaks , implying that @xmath0co  21 will no longer be optically thin in dense parts of the lupus clouds .",
    "maps of @xmath0co  21 peak @xmath18  follow the extinction maps of @xcite better than maps of integrated intensity do , suggesting widespread breakdown of the optically thin approximation . the maximum peak @xmath18  toward lupus  i and iv is about 3.5k in each map , implying a minimum excitation temperature , @xmath24 , of 8k ; the peak @xmath18  in lupus  iii reaches 5k near the bright stars , so @xmath25k in this area .",
    "@xcite adopted 13k for their analysis of @xmath0co  10 toward lupus  i. a comparison of the lower @xmath0co  contours to the most recent c2d extinction maps suggests that excitation temperatures of 810  k will reproduce the extinction - traced column density quite well .",
    "while higher excitation temperatures are not ruled out by the molecular line data , they would lead to lower column density estimates which would be less compatible with estimates from extinction , which is probably the least biased estimator of the true column density @xcite .",
    "gas masses are estimated from the @xmath0co  21 data as follows : the ratio of the peak @xmath18  to the maximum possible brightness temperature ( for assumed @xmath24 ) yields an estimate of the peak optical depth @xmath26 ; this is multiplied by the line width to estimate @xmath27 , which is proportional to the column density of @xmath0co   ( @xmath28 , appendix  [ app - co ] ) .",
    "@xmath28 is converted to a total gas column density by assuming conversions between @xmath28 and extinction @xmath29 ( see below ) , and between @xmath29 and the column density of hydrogen ( @xmath30@xmath31 , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming a distance of 150pc , the total gas mass enclosed in a 1arcmin@xmath6 pixel is then calculated .",
    "the relationship between @xmath0co  column density and extinction can be expressed as @xmath32  @xmath33 , with the extinction threshold @xmath34 reflecting the minimum column density required for the presence of @xmath0co .",
    "the most commonly used parameters come from a study of @xmath10  oph by ( * ? ? ? * flw ) : @xmath35@xmath31  @xmath36 , @xmath37mag ; other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found values of @xmath38 in the range 2.22.7 , and extinction thresholds of 01.6  mag .",
    "recently , a comprehensive study of the perseus complex @xcite found @xmath39@xmath31  @xmath36 @xmath40mag overall , and @xmath41@xmath31  @xmath36 , @xmath42mag toward the west end of the complex ( pwe ) , comprising several dark clouds , which is likely to be the best analog to the lupus clouds .    estimated masses of the lupus clouds above @xmath29 thresholds of 2 and 3  mag are given in table  [ tab - mass ] , along with the mean and dispersion of the line widths of material with @xmath43 .",
    "( the line width distribution for @xmath44 is very similar , varying only by about 0.1kms@xmath1 . )",
    "masses have been calculated for @xmath45k and for three @xmath0co - to-@xmath29 relations : pwe , perseus , and flw .",
    "the quoted mass is the estimate using @xmath46k and pwe , and the positive and negative errors give the full range of mass estimates .",
    "other estimates of mass and line width from the literature are also tabulated .",
    "previous isotopically substituted co results relied , directly or indirectly , on the older ratio of @xmath47 to @xmath29 ( @xmath48@xmath31 , * ? ? ? * ) , and have been rescaled to use the same ratio as in this work .",
    "the extinction mass of lupus  iii has also been rescaled to assume a distance of 150pc instead of the 200pc used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the masses of lupus  i , iii ( including lupus  iiin ) and iv are estimated to be 280 , 150 , and 80  @xmath49 respectively ( for @xmath43 ) .",
    "the extinction mass of lupus  i ( 251  @xmath49 ) is similar to the @xmath0co  21 estimate ; those of lupus  iii and iv are significantly greater ( 250 and 120  @xmath49 ) , but still consistent with the @xmath0co  21 error range .",
    "this suggests that the lupus complex has spatial variations in the @xmath0co - to-@xmath29  ratio , as perseus does @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath0co  10 mass estimate toward lupus  i is 880  @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0co  10 map covers a much larger area than ours ( almost 10deg@xmath6 ) and includes significant emission to the se and sw of our map boundaries . within the confines of the @xmath0co21 map , we estimate that the @xmath0co  10 mass should be 600700  @xmath49 , still about 50% more than the upper limit of our mass range .",
    "a similar discrepancy was reported by @xcite , whose mass estimate for lupus  ii is about a factor of 3 lower than that of @xcite ; but their mass estimate for lupus  iv is quite similar to ours .",
    "possible reasons for the discrepancies include the undersampling of the nanten maps ( which will tend to overestimate the area of structures ) and differences in the calibration of the two telescopes .",
    "@xcite measured only 240@xmath49 toward lupus  i in c@xmath5o  10 , which is much closer to our estimate .",
    "the additional mass in the @xmath0co  10 map might comprise tenuous gas in which the 21 transition is not fully excited , and whose column density is low enough for it not to be detectable in c@xmath5o  10 .",
    "the @xmath0co  10 mass estimate toward lupus  iii ( 220  @xmath49 ) is consistent with our data and close to the extinction result , while the c@xmath5o  10 estimates toward lupus  iii and iiin ( 80 and 5  @xmath49 ) are much lower .",
    "the average line widths for the lupus clouds ( table  [ tab - mass ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been deconvolved by subtracting the aos channel width in quadrature , and , at 1.52.7  kms@xmath1 , are broader than the @xmath0co  10 widths reported at emission peaks by @xcite , much broader than the 0.9  kms@xmath1  given by @xcite as the typical line width , and also broader than the c@xmath5o  10 line widths toward individual cores ( table  [ tab - mcs ] ) .",
    "c@xmath5o  10 is expected to display narrower lines than @xmath0co  21 , since the more optically thin transition arises mainly from the denser gas in the center of the cores , which generally has a lower velocity dispersion .",
    "it is harder to see why there should be a discrepancy between @xmath0co  10 and 21 line widths .",
    "however , the 10 measurements are taken from two spectra extracted from the map , so the data are insufficient to investigate the disagreement .",
    "despite these differences , the various line width measurements follow the same pattern : lupus  i and iii have quite similar line widths , lupus  iiin has broader lines and lupus  iv narrower .",
    "based on the line widths of @xmath0co  21 and the velocity gradients observed toward the clouds , it is clear that they are gravitationally unbound ( although their general filamentary shape makes the standard formula for virial mass hard to apply ) .",
    "lupus  iv , however , may be marginally bound due to its high column density , narrow lines and low velocity gradients : the lower limit to its virial mass is estimated to be @xmath50140@xmath49 , while the upper limit to the mass derived from the @xmath0co  21 map is @xmath50150@xmath49 .",
    "@xcite found almost all of the dense cores that they identified in c@xmath5o  10 to be gravitationally unbound ; the greater line widths in @xmath0co  21 reinforce this conclusion .",
    "because of their small areal coverage , concentrating on @xmath0co  21 emission peaks , the co 43 maps do not provide the same extensive overview of the clouds .",
    "the 43 map of lupus  i , however , covers most of the b228 ridge . throughout most of the ridge ,",
    "the peak @xmath18  lies between 1 and 2k , corresponding to excitation temperatures of 79k ( assuming that the co emission is optically thick throughout , with a filling factor of unity ) .",
    "the ends of the ridge may be warmer , with peak @xmath18  of 34k implying excitation temperatures of 1012k .",
    "the 43 maps of lupus  iii and iiin show the majority of the gas to be similar to the ridge in lupus  i , with @xmath51k . within the main lupus  iii cloud",
    "there are two maxima : one with peak @xmath18  of 4k ( @xmath52k ) , while the other peaks at 9k .",
    "this latter one appears very compact , and so its excitation temperature may be significantly higher than the 18k minimum implied by its peak @xmath18 .",
    "the 43 map of lupus  iv covers only the very center of the cloud , with peak @xmath18  of 34k ( @xmath531012k ) .      towards the b228 ridge , maps of extinction @xcite , peak @xmath18  ( figure  [ fig - lui - tmax ] ) , and integrated intensity ( figure  [ fig - lui - int ] )",
    "are not well correlated .",
    "the extinction map is the most robust estimator of column density @xcite : it shows a very strong peak in the middle of the ridge ( dc 338.8 + 16.5 ) , slightly less to the se ( 339.2 + 16.1 ) , and a broad low plateau to the nw ( 338.7 + 17.5 ) .",
    "the @xmath0co  21 peak @xmath18  map has similar peaks toward all three dark clouds , while the co 43 peak @xmath18  map shows no significant peak toward 338.8 + 16.5 in the center .",
    "the integrated intensity map is very different from the extinction map , with the strongest emission in the nw followed by 339.2 + 16.1 in the se , and 338.8 + 16.5 comparatively weak in the center ( hardly appearing in the co 43 integrated intensity map ) .",
    "previous molecular line studies have found a velocity gradient of about 0.3  kms@xmath1pc@xmath1  along the b228 ridge @xcite , but the channel and velocity maps ( figures  [ fig - lui - chan ] and [ fig - lui - vcen ] ) show very little evidence of a smooth velocity gradient along the ridge .",
    "rather , the two large clumps at the nw and se end of the ridge have velocities that differ by about 3  kms@xmath1 , while the ridge between them lies at an intermediate velocity . on the other hand",
    ", a velocity gradient across the center of the ridge shows up very clearly in both 21 and 43 maps : the gradient of about 1  kms@xmath1pc@xmath1  is quite strong , compared not only to previously reported gradients in this cloud , but also to the gradients of 0.10.4  kms@xmath1pc@xmath1  found in areas of taurus @xcite .",
    "the gradient is smooth and coherent over the whole of this region  an extent of more than 1  pc  and appears quite linear , which would be consistent with solid - body rotation around the long axis of the filament @xcite .",
    "a coherent pattern in this region may also be seen in the line width maps ( figure  [ fig - lui - lwid ] ) , which show an increase in line width toward the leading ( ne ) edge of the ridge .",
    "there is no sign of a velocity gradient across the nw half of b228 , which suggests that the nw part of the ridge may be distinct from the center .",
    "one of the peaks in the center of the ridge , dc  3388 + 165 - 5 , is associated with iras 15398 - 3359 : this class 0 yso @xcite has a compact ( @xmath501 ) molecular outflow with a dynamical timescale of about 2kyr @xcite .",

    "however , the @xmath0co  21 emission is also optically thick ( for @xmath89k , @xmath29  of 13  mag implies an optical depth of about 8) , and so will trace similar material .",
    "these temperature estimates tend to support the argument that the gas is too warm for depletion of h@xmath0co@xmath12  to explain the lack of emission toward the co peak @xcite , although the estimates are unlikely to apply to the center of the clump .",
    "the strong co 43 emission implies that the transition is thermalized , so a significant amount of the gas in the clump must have volume density @xmath90@xmath63 .",
    "while @xcite derived an average volume density of @xmath2@xmath63 , there must be enough significantly denser gas to thermalize the co 43 line , but not enough to excite the h@xmath0co@xmath12  10 transition .    in projection ,",
    "lupus  iii lies far away from any part of sco - cen @xcite , in contrast to lupus  i and lupus  iv ( discussed below ) , so the hae / be stars probably influence it far more than the ob associations . however , there is evidence for lupus  iii being further away than lupus  i and iv , possibly as much as 50  pc ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this is the case , then lupus  iii could lie behind sco - cen , and could be affected by either or both of upper - sco and upper - cen - lup .",
    "the large line widths seen toward lupus  iiin could be caused by external influence in the same way as the broader lines seen toward lupus  i.      the peak @xmath18  in co 43 toward lupus  iv of about 4k , implying @xmath91  k , occurs around the outside of the extinction peaks , which have peak @xmath18  around 3k ( @xmath25k ) .",
    "this suggests that the outside of the clump is significantly externally heated .",
    "the @xmath0co  21 peak @xmath18  implies @xmath92k , but even this measure is unlikely to sample the extinction maxima properly , since it will be dominated by the outer layers of the structure .",
    "the co 43 temperature estimates are in line with those seen at the nw end of b228 , where lupus  i seems to be strongly affected by upper - sco .",
    "lupus  iv is on the opposite side of the lupus complex to lupus  i , upper - sco and its shell @xcite , but faces the upper - cen - lup subgroup , which lies to the w and sw .",
    "@xcite suggested that lupus  iv was shaped by the influences of both subgroups , and noted that some of the velocity gradients they saw in lupus  iv were along the vector toward upper - cen - lup .",
    "much of the enhancement in the peak co 43 @xmath18  lies on the s and w sides of the extinction peaks , which is consistent with a picture of external heating by the radiation field from upper - cen - lup .",
    "there is , however , no nearby shell , the upper - cen - lup shell having passed the lupus clouds long ago @xcite .",
    "if interaction with the shell causes the enhanced line width at the nw end of b228 , the lack of any such interaction in lupus  iv would be consistent with its rather low line widths .",
    "fully sampled degree - scale maps of the @xmath0co  21 emission toward the lupus i , iii , and iv clouds trace the column density and temperature of the gas , the transition becoming optically thick in the cloud cores .",
    "the peak @xmath18  is well correlated with the near - ir extinction @xcite , and a comparison of the two suggests that the bulk of the molecular gas in lupus has a temperature of 810k , rather than the 1017k generally adopted elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this estimate is fairly robust to changes in the relationship between @xmath0co  column density and @xmath29 .",
    "estimates of the cloud masses from the @xmath0co  maps are reasonably consistent with those derived from extinction mapping .",
    "the differences between these estimates vary greatly from cloud to cloud , and suggest that there may be significant spatial variation in the @xmath0co - to-@xmath29   relationship , as found in the perseus complex @xcite .",
    "the line widths of @xmath0co  21 toward the clouds are higher than previous estimates @xcite , around 2kms@xmath1 , with lupus  iiin rather broad and lupus  iv rather narrow .",
    "fully sampled co 43 maps covering most of lupus  i and small regions of lupus  iii and iv trace dense gas : the peak @xmath18  generally indicates excitation temperatures quite close to those of @xmath0co  21 , and hence that the transition is largely thermalized .",
    "this suggests that the volume density @xmath93@xmath63 , although modelling will be required to ascertain the required density .",
    "co 43 emission is pervasive toward lupus  i ( the map of which covers a large area ) , implying that this dense gas is found either throughout or all around the outside of the cloud , although it may comprise a fairly small fraction of the cloud mass .",
    "the physical conditions of the molecular gas vary along the b228 ridge in lupus  i. at the nw end , the gas has broader lines and probably higher temperature than in the bulk of the cloud ; the column density is not particularly high and there is only one class  iii yso . in the center of the ridge , the dark cloud 338.8 + 16.5",
    "is associated with recent star formation @xcite ; in this area a coherent velocity gradient of about 1kms@xmath1pc@xmath1  runs across the ridge .",
    "the se end of the ridge is complex , with ysos , enhanced line width and integrated intensity on the nw side , and column density ( and possibly temperature ) peaking to the se .",
    "the enhanced line widths and velocity gradient in b228 are consistent with a dynamical interaction between lupus  i and the shell around the upper - sco subgroup of sco - cen @xcite .    to the north of lupus  iii",
    ", the small cloud lupus  iiin has similar characteristics to the bulk of the other clouds , albeit with broader lines and significant velocity structure .",
    "lupus  iii itself contains a compact co peak which is probably heated by the nearby hae / be stars hr5999 and 6000 .",
    "the gas in this clump contains sufficiently dense gas to thermalize the co 43 transition ( @xmath94@xmath63 ) , but not to thermalize the h@xmath0co@xmath12  transition mapped by @xcite , which would require @xmath95@xmath63 .",
    "the rest of lupus  iii seems to have quite similar physical conditions to those in the rest of the clouds , and shows no particular sign of being affected by the nearby ob subgroups .",
    "lupus  iv contains peaks of very high column density @xcite associated with slightly warmer gas temperatures ( 1012k ) .",
    "these temperatures are estimated from the optically - thick co 43 transition , which is strongest around the extinction cores , suggesting significant external heating .",
    "the average line width of @xmath0co  21 , however , is significantly lower than those of lupus  i and iii .",
    "lupus  iv faces the upper - cen - lup subgroup of sco - cen and @xcite suggested that it is influenced by the ob stars ; the upper - cen - lup shell passed by the lupus clouds a few myr ago , so lupus  iv is more likely to be affected by the radiation field from the ob stars .    despite the basic similarities in their physical conditions , the three clouds have significant differences : lupus  i appears to be strongly affected by external thermal and dynamical influences from the nearby upper - sco ob association , and does not display widespread star formation .",
    "lupus  iii shows no sign of external influence  parts of the cloud are heated internally by its own young stars .",
    "lupus  iiin seems entirely quiescent , yet has a large average line width .",
    "lupus  iv has the greatest column density and the narrowest average line width , has almost no star formation as yet , and may be heated externally by the upper - cen - lup ob association .    a detailed spatial comparison of co and extinction maps will yield more accurate estimates of the physical conditions of the lupus clouds , as well as mapping the variation in the @xmath0co - to-@xmath29  ratio .",
    "mapping of additional co transitions is crucial to the understanding of the clouds : more optically - thin lines ( c@xmath5o  and even @xmath96 ) are particularly important . maps of the upper - sco shell with comparable resolution to the lupus maps are required to look for more definitive signs of interaction between the shell and the molecular clouds .",
    "more sophisticated radiative transfer calculations are beyond the scope of this work , but are required to use the co 43 emission as a proper constraint on the physical conditions of the gas , and hence to understand the structure of the lupus clouds and how they are affected by the local environment .",

    "because the aos backends are analog devices , laser mode hopping causes shifts in their frequency calibration . a number of such shifts occurred over the nine - month period during which these data were taken .",
    "the fundamental frequency calibration for each spectrometer was obtained once , by connecting a frequency synthesizer to the if input of the aos to obtain the aos channel width and the channel number of a fiducial frequency .",
    "the frequency scale thus defined was used for all data in this paper , but some corrections had to be made .",
    "the change in channel width caused by a mode - hop is negligible , but the entire spectrum is offset by a few channels .",
    "the frequency shifts were tracked with a number of fiducials .",
    "each aos includes a comb generator which is usually used to obtain several frequency calibration scans per hour , giving excellent frequency tracking . however , the comb generator failed during 2005 , so other frequency standards had to be used .",
    "for the co 43 observations , the mesospheric co 43 line is so strong that it can be picked up without a switched measurement .",
    "so the ` sky ' spectra , used to estimate the sky temperature for calibration , show the line at an antenna velocity close to zero .",
    "the mesospheric co abundance has a strong seasonal variation , and became so weak at the end of the austral winter ( around september ) that it could no longer be seen in the sky spectra .",
    "finally , repeated spectra were taken toward the compact region ngc  3576 .",
    "this source has velocity structure on the scale of the ast / ro beam , so pointing uncertainties translate into velocity uncertainties .",
    "these three fiducials were combined to track the frequency scale .",
    "the majority of @xmath0co  21 spectra were corrected by 13kms@xmath1 , and some were corrected by up to 5kms@xmath1 .",
    "about 90% of the co 43 spectra were corrected by @xmath97kms@xmath1 , with the remainder corrected by 3.9kms@xmath1 .",
    "frequency shifts also show up as inconsistencies in the maps .",
    "the 43 observations showed no obvious inconsistencies , but some shifts had to be applied to the @xmath0co  21 data : channel maps of lupus  i showed that data taken in 2005 november had a significant uncorrected frequency shift compared to earlier , better - calibrated data . in addition , the long - integration spectrum toward one of the reference positions with significant 21 emission was shifted by about half a channel with respect to the map spectra into which it was added .",
    "this was not corrected , because the facility for combining spectra in comb only handles integer - channel shifts , and the effect of the shift is negligible , even in the channel maps .",
    "the co and @xmath0co  data in this work are analyzed under the assumption of lte ( i.e. , the excitation temperature , @xmath24 , and gas kinetic temperature , @xmath98 , are the same ) .",
    "for the two transitions considered in this work , equation  ( 14.46 ) of @xcite yields @xmath99 for co 43 ( neglecting the cosmic microwave background term ) , and @xmath100 for @xmath0co  21 .",
    "these equations are correct if the transitions are optically thick , and completely fill the beam ; otherwise they underestimate @xmath24 . in lupus ,",
    "the gas is cold enough ( @xmath101 ) that @xmath18  is significantly different from @xmath24 .",
    "the column density in the lower level of the @xmath0co  21 transition is given by @xmath102 and this can be converted to the total column density of @xmath0co  by correcting for the partition function : @xmath103 ranges from 2.1 to 2.3 for @xmath24 of 710k .    in lte , the ratio of @xmath0co  21 to 10 emission depends only on temperature .",
    "if both transitions are optically thick , the ratio is simply the ratio of brightness temperatures at different frequencies for a given @xmath24 , and will range from 0.7 ( at 7k ) to unity ( at high temperature ) . in the optically thin case ,",
    "this ratio is multiplied by the ratio of optical depths , which also depends on @xmath24 via the partition function : this ratio ranges from 1 to 2 between 6k and 15k , with a high - temperature limit of 3 .",
    "the 21/10 line ratio should therefore range from 0.7 to about 2 in lupus .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0co  21 optical depth to c@xmath5o  10 optical depth is just the ratio of @xmath0co  21/10 optical depths , multiplied by the @xmath104 abundance ratio : the @xmath105 isotope ratio is @xmath106 in the local ism @xcite , but the double ratio @xmath104 is not as well known . combining the solar @xmath107 ratio of 500 @xcite with the local ism @xmath105 ratio yields @xmath108 , but @xcite point out that @xmath105 and @xmath107 should track one another , being similarly dependent on star formation history , and so a solar ratio ( @xmath109 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be more appropriate .",
    "thus the ratio of optical depths should fall in the range of 4 to about 16 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0co  21 emission to c@xmath5o  10 , however , is complicated by the fact that the c@xmath5o  transition is likely to be fairly optically thin , while the @xmath0co  transition will have moderate to high optical depth .",
    "this will tend to reduce the ratio : conditions in lupus are likely to yield emission ratios as low as 24 .",
    "below a critical volume density @xmath77 , lte fails ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the critical density itself depends on physical conditions : the effective spontaneous emission rate @xmath111 is reduced at high optical depth , yielding a lower @xmath77 , and collisional transition rates are temperature - dependent . in the optically thin limit , @xmath77(co43 )",

    "<S> enhanced line widths at the nw end and along the edge of the b228 ridge in lupus  i , and a coherent velocity gradient across the ridge , are consistent with interaction between the molecular cloud and an expanding shell from the upper - scorpius subgroup of the sco - cen ob association . </S>",
    "<S> lupus  iii is dominated by the effects of two hae / be stars , and shows no sign of external influence . </S>",
    "<S> slightly warmer gas around the core of lupus  iv and a low line width suggest heating by the upper - centaurus - lupus subgroup of sco - cen , without the effects of an shell . </S>"
