    "a new class of dynamical problems , which also have a vast potential for physical applications , emerges in the investigation of soliton dynamics in extended versions of the nls equation , in which coefficients are periodic functions of the evolutional variable .",
    "a well - known example is a nonlinear fiber - optic link subjected to _ dispersion management _ ( dm ) , which implies that the dispersion coefficient periodically alternates between positive and negative values .",
    "the dm links support a family of stable temporal solitons ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , and also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . somewhat similar is a _ waveguide - antiwaveguide _ system , which can be realized in the spatial domain ( planar optical waveguides ) . in the latter case ,",
    "a light beam is transmitted through a periodic concatenation of nonlinear waveguiding and antiwaveguiding segments @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the latter system with the dm is that the coefficient which periodically jumps between positive and negative values also belongs to the linear part of the equation .",
    "another technique that may be useful for optical telecommunications is _ nonlinearity management _ ( nlm ) , which assumes that the coefficient in front of the nonlinear term periodically changes its sign .",
    "an advantage offered by the nlm is a possibility to compensate the nonlinear phase shift accumulating in pulses due to the kerr nonlinearity of the optical fiber @xcite . in practical terms",
    ", the nlm can be implemented by dint of elements with a strong quadratic ( @xmath5 ) nonlinearity , which are periodically inserted into the fiber link .",
    "the @xmath5 elements can emulate a negative kerr effect through the cascading mechanism @xcite .",
    "various other schemes of nlm in fiber - optic links were considered , including its combination with the dm , amplifiers , etc .",
    "a related scheme makes use of the nlm in soliton - generating lasers based on fiber rings @xcite .",
    "the nlm for spatial solitons , which assumes alternation of self - focusing and self - defocusing nonlinear layers in planar @xcite or bulk @xcite waveguides , was introduced too .",
    "all these systems may be regarded as examples of periodically inhomogeneous optical waveguiding media .",
    "other examples belonging to the same general class are _ tandem waveguides _",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and the _ split - step _ _ model _ @xcite .",
    "these are built as a juxtaposition of linear segments alternating with ones featuring , respectively , quadratic or cubic nonlinearity .",
    "a common feature of the models of all these types is that they support _ robust _ solitons , despite a  naive \" expectation that solitons would quickly decay , periodically hitting interfaces between strongly different elements of which the system is composed .",
    "the above - mentioned optical media are described by the nls equation , in which the role of the evolutional variable belongs to the propagation distance , while the remaining free variable is either the local time ( for temporal solitons ) , or the transverse coordinate(s ) , in the spatial - domain models .",
    "mathematically similar , but physically altogether different , models describe becs in the 1d geometry . in that case , the corresponding nls equation is usually called the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "it governs the evolution of the mean - field wave function @xmath6 in time ( @xmath7 ) , the other variable , @xmath8 , being the coordinate along the quasi-1d trap . in the normalized form",
    ", the gp equation is @xmath9where @xmath10 is the potential which confines the condensate , and the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath11 is proportional to the scattering length of collisions between atoms .",
    "two natural possibilities to introduce a time - periodic ( ac )  management \" in the bec context are either through a periodic modulation of the confining potential , most typically in the form of @xmath12 x^{2}$ ] , or by means of time modulation of the scattering length , using the feshbach resonance ( fr ) @xcite . in the latter case , the nonlinearity coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) takes the form of @xmath13 . in either case , the modulation is generated by a combination of dc and ac magnetic fields applied to the bec .",
    "the gp equation with the periodically modulated strength of the trapping potential was considered for both @xmath14 ( when solitons do not exist , and the bec as a whole is subjected to the  management \" , including the 2d and 3d cases ) @xcite , and @xmath15 , when the soliton is the basic dynamical object @xcite .",
    "in particular , a parametric resonance is possible in the former case , and creation of an effectively trapping potential , while the underlying one is anti - trapping , having @xmath16 , by the high - frequency ac part of the potential ( with large @xmath0 ) was predicted in the latter case .",
    "the periodic modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient through the  ac fr management \" is an especially interesting possibility , as the fr is a highly efficient experimental tool , broadly used for the study of various dynamical properties of the becs @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been predicted that the modulation through the ac fr makes it possible to preclude collapse and generate stable soliton - like structures in 2d ( but not 3d ) condensates @xcite ; in fact , this prediction is similar to the earlier considered possibility of the stabilization of 2d spatial optical solitons in a bulk waveguide subjected to the periodic nlm @xcite . in the 1d model of the gp type ,",
    "subjected to the nlm , various stable dynamical states , including gaussian - shaped soliton - like objects , and ones of the thomas - fermi type , were studied in detail @xcite .",
    "in addition , analysis based on averaged equations was developed , for this case , in ref .",
    "@xcite ( similarly to the analysis elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of the periodic modulation of the trapping potential ) .",
    "the objective of this work is to study _ resonance effects _ produced by the ac fr management , i.e. , harmonic modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient , in the dynamics of fundamental and higher - order 1d solitons in the nls equation",
    ". we will focus on the case when the ac part of the nonlinear coefficient is small in comparison with its constant ( dc ) part @xmath17 , which accounts for the self - attraction in the bec , and is normalized to be @xmath18 .",
    "we also assume that the soliton s width is much smaller than the effective size of the trap , hence the external potential may be dropped .",
    "the consideration of the gp equation without the trapping potential makes it possible to identify fundamental dynamical effects for the solitons induced by the ac fr management . in this connection , it is necessary to mention that , in the 1d case , the trapping potential is not a crucial factor , on the contrary to the 2d and 3d cases , where the external potential plays a much more important role , in view of the intrinsic instability of the multi - dimensional nls solitons .",

    "section 4 concludes the paper .",

    "( [ nlse ] ) , the plot shown in fig .",

    "thus , we arrive at the driven linearized equation for the perturbation , @xmath44 .",

    "figure [ fig2 ] displays the evolution of the perturbation close to the resonance at @xmath46 , as found from direct numerical integration of the linearized equation ( [ lin ] ) , with the initial condition @xmath47 .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the perturbation grows in time at the center , and simultaneously expands in space .",
    "strictly speaking , the latter feature remains valid as long as the size of the region occupied by the expanding wave fields remains essentially smaller than the limit imposed by the confining field .    the linearized equation ( [ lin ] )",
    "is too difficult for an exact analytical solution .",
    "however , the observation that the characteristic spatial scale of the solution observed in fig .

[ fig1](b ) .",
    "although these results , obtained for the weak time - periodic fr management , seem very simple , they have not been reported before , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we also notice that the usual variational approximation ( va )  for the nls solitons , which is efficient in explaining a number of other perturbative effects @xcite , can not account for the occurrence of the resonance at @xmath64 , because the va neglects radiation effects , while the above consideration showed that it is exactly the radiation field which is amenable for the manifestations of the resonance .",

    ", we do not consider this issue here in detail .",
    "as is well known , the unperturbed nls equation gives rise to exact soliton solutions of order @xmath1 , in the form of periodically oscillating breathers , which start from the initial conditions @xmath66with an integer @xmath67 @xcite [ the expression ( [ n ] ) assumes that the initial configuration is placed at the center of the integration domain ] .",

    "nevertheless , not any perturbation readily splits the higher - order soliton into its fundamental constituents ; usually , the splitting is easily induced by specific nonconservative terms added to the nls equation , such as the one accounting for the intra - pulse stimulated raman scattering in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the consideration of dynamics of the higher - order solitons is also relevant , especially in the context of becs , as the corresponding initial configurations can be created in the real experiment .",

    "<S> we consider effects of a periodic modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient on fundamental and higher - order solitons in the one - dimensional nls equation , which is an issue of direct interest to bose - einstein condensates in the context of the feshbach - resonance control , and fiber - optic telecommunications as concerns periodic compensation of the nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> we find from simulations , and explain by means of a straightforward analysis , that the response of a fundamental soliton to the weak perturbation is resonant , if the modulation frequency @xmath0 is close to the intrinsic frequency of the soliton . for higher - order @xmath1-solitons with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the response to an extremely weak perturbation is also resonant , if @xmath0 is close to the corresponding intrinsic frequency . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , a slightly stronger drive splits the @xmath4- or @xmath3-soliton , respectively , into a set of two or three moving fundamental solitons . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the threshold perturbation amplitude , necessary for the splitting , on @xmath0 has a resonant character too . </S>",
    "<S> amplitudes and velocities of the emerging fundamental solitons are accurately predicted , using exact and approximate conservation laws of the perturbed nls equation .    </S>",
