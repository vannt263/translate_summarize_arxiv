    "in their survey of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars , @xcite discovered that the galactic halo star sdss j090745.0 + 024507 ( hereafter hvs ) has a radial velocity of @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to a galactic rest - frame radial velocity of @xmath9 , well above the local escape speed from the galaxy .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , the only plausible mechanism for achieving this extreme velocity is ejection from the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole ( cbh ) , as predicted by @xcite , and studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the detection of the hvs and other hypervelocity stars is important because it allows one to probe the population of stars near the cbh in the milky way s recent past .",
    "in addition , it may be possible to use these stars to constrain the various scenarios for the origin of the young stars detected near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "finally , precise proper motion measurements of hypervelocity stars ejected from the galactic center can be used to probe the shape of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity and distance to the hvs suffers from a two - fold degeneracy which hampers the interpretation of its origin .",
    "this degeneracy arises from the coincidence that the main sequence and horizontal branch overlap at the measured effective temperature @xmath10 and surface gravity of the hvs .",
    "thus the hvs could be either a bhb giant or a b9 main - sequence star .",
    "the intrinsic luminosities of these two types of stars differ by a factor of @xmath11 , and thus the inferred distances to the hvs differ by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "the distance is @xmath13 or @xmath4 if the hvs is a bhb star or main - sequence star , respectively .    in order to search for photometric variability and",
    "so pin down its properties , we performed precise photometry of the hvs using the mmt 6.5 m telescope .",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction in  [ sec : data ] . as we discuss in  [ sec : ana ] , we find that the star is indeed variable , and we constrain the variability to be short - period ( @xmath14 ) and low - amplitude ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "together with the measured effective temperature , we argue in  [ sec : spb ] that this puts the hvs in the class of b9 main - sequence stars that pulsate with periods of the order of one day , so - called slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , our observations resolve the two - fold ambiguity and indicate that the hvs is a main - sequence star with heliocentric distance of @xmath4 .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we obtained photometric data on the hvs during two nights ( ut 2005 january 15 , april 13 ) with the megacam ccd camera @xcite on the mmt 6.5 m telescope , and during four nights ( ut 2005 january 13,15 - 17 ) with the 1.2-meter telescope at flwo . using megacam we obtained 9 @xmath16-band images on the first night , and 16 @xmath16-band and 9 @xmath17-band images on the second night .",
    "these high signal - to - noise ratio data were used to detect the variability of the star .",
    "the flwo data were obtained in the @xmath18-band over 7 epochs , in order to constrain the amplitude of the variability .",
    "the raw images were reduced in the usual manner .",
    "photometry was carried out using psf - fitting photometry with the package daophot ii @xcite .",
    "we used 15 - 30 reference stars to obtain the relative photometry between different epochs .",
    "we roughly calibrated our relative photometry using sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) absolute photometry @xcite of the nearby comparison star sdss j090751.07 + 024534.9 .",
    "figure [ fig : curve ] shows the @xmath16-band and @xmath17-band light curves for the hvs constructed from the megacam data .",
    "the @xmath16-band data from the two nights are shown in separate panels .",
    "the hvs is variable in the @xmath16-band , but shows no evidence for variability within the errors in the @xmath17-band .",
    "the @xmath16-band variability is certainly real , as evidenced by the photometry of the slightly fainter and nearby comparison star sdss j090751.07 + 024534.9 , which is constant to within the errors ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : curve ] ) .",
    "the flwo data are of considerably lower precision than the mmt data , with photometric errors of @xmath19 , as compared to @xmath20 for the mmt data .",
    "the flwo data therefore do not provide strong constraints on the periodicity of the hvs s variability . as we explain in  [ sec : ana ] , these data are nevertheless very useful because they constrain the amplitude of the variability to be @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig : curve ] shows that the hvs star is variable in the @xmath16-band .",
    "the rms deviation over the @xmath22 3.5 hours of data on the second night is nearly 6 times larger than that of the comparison star .",
    "a constant flux fit to the @xmath16-band data has @xmath23 for @xmath24 degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) , and so is a poor representation of the data . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath17-band data are consistent with a constant flux , with @xmath25 for @xmath26 dof .    in order to constrain the period and amplitude of the variability",
    ", we fit the data to the model : @xmath27+m_{0,j } , \\label{eqn : model}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the magnitude of observation @xmath29 taken at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the period , @xmath32 is the amplitude , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 correspond to the magnitude zero point and phase at the error - weighted mean observation time , @xmath35 . we assume separate magnitude zero points @xmath33 for each data set @xmath36 ( mmt or flwo ) . fitting is equivalent to a lomb - scargle periodogram with a floating mean @xcite .",
    "we search for fits at @xmath37 equally - spaced steps in @xmath38 in the range @xmath39 .",
    "if we fit only the mmt @xmath16-band data , we can only place a lower limit on the period and amplitude of the variability , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this fact can be understood from inspection of the data in figure [ fig : curve ] .",
    "the @xmath16-band data for both nights are nearly consistent with a simple linear decline with slope @xmath42 .",
    "thus the data can be approximately described by any model satisfying @xmath43 , for @xmath31 much larger than the duration of the observations on any given night , @xmath44 .",
    "fitting both the @xmath16-band mmt and @xmath18-band flwo datasets simultaneously constrains the period and amplitude of the variability .",
    "we assume that the amplitude , period , and phase of the variability is the same in the @xmath16 and @xmath18 bands .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the resulting periodogram , plotted as @xmath45 versus @xmath31 .",
    "we find a best - fit for @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 for 32 - 5=27 dof .",
    "the best - fit model is shown in figure [ fig : three ] , together with both the mmt and flwo data folded about the best - fit period .",
    "this fit is not unique .",
    "there are flanking aliases with periods separated by @xmath50 , corresponding to an integer number of additional cycles between the @xmath51 separating the two nights of the @xmath16-band data .",
    "there are also fits at periods of @xmath52 and @xmath53 that are equally good ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "finally , essentially all periods with @xmath55 are allowed at the @xmath56 level .",
    "because the @xmath16-band data on any individual night show little curvature , only the slope is well constrained , and so the amplitude of the fit is correlated with the period .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : zero ] , where we show the 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath57 allowed regions in the @xmath58 plane .",
    "we see that longer periods require larger amplitudes .",
    "however , regardless of the best fit , we can rule out periods @xmath59 and @xmath60 and amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath17-band data show no evidence for variability . adopting the best - fit period and phase from the @xmath16 and @xmath18-band data ,",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath17-band variability is @xmath63 at the @xmath64 confidence level .",
    "the amplitude and period of the hvs s variability , as well as its effective temperature , are all consistent with the class of slowly pulsating b - type main - sequence stars first identified by @xcite .",
    "these stars are multi - periodic , non - radial pulsators with periods of @xmath65 days , amplitudes of a few millimagnitudes to a few percent , and effective temperatures of @xmath66 . according to @xcite",
    "the hvs would fall in the low temperature boundary of the instability strip calculated by @xcite for spbs .",
    "in fact , there is a striking similarity between the hvs and the known spb star hd45953 , reported by @xcite , which is also at the low temperature edge of the class with @xmath67 k , @xmath68 days , and @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "spb stars are also known to have lower amplitudes in redder bandpasses , with relative amplitudes that are consistent with the upper limit on the hvs s @xmath17-band variability of @xmath70 .",
    "on the other hand , there is evidence that bhb stars do not vary at this level . studying a predominantly bhb cluster with high precision photometry",
    ", @xcite found more than 200 rr lyrae variables ( with similar periods to the hvs ) , but no bhb stars that showed significant variation .",
    "see @xcite for more discussion on the variability of hb stars .",
    "the fact that the hvs is variable with @xmath71 , and that bhb stars do not vary at this level , implies that it is a main sequence star .",
    "hence its temperature @xmath72 indicates a luminosity of @xmath73 , giving a distance of 71 kpc @xcite . using the reported velocity for the hvs ( @xmath74 ) and assuming its movement is only radial we obtain a travel time from the center of the galaxy of @xmath75 gyr . for a @xmath76 b9 star ,",
    "the evolutionary tracks of @xcite give a main - sequence lifetime of @xmath77 gyr .",
    "we have performed high - precision , time - series photometry of the hypervelocity star sdss j090745.0 + 024507 , which shows that it is a low - amplitude , short - period variable .",
    "a sinusoidal fit to the light curve yields a best - fit period of @xmath78 and amplitude of @xmath79 , however this fit is not unique and the exact values of the amplitude and period of the variation are poorly constrained .",
    "nevertheless , the period and amplitude are constrained to be in the range @xmath71 and @xmath55 .",
    "together with the known effective temperature of @xmath80 ( spectral type b9 ) , this variability implies that the hvs is a member of the class of slowly pulsating b - type main sequence stars identified by @xcite .",
    "this identification resolves the previously - reported two - fold degeneracy in the luminosity and hence distance to the hvs .",
    "the hvs has a mass of @xmath81 , an age of @xmath5 , a heliocentric distance of @xmath82 kpc and a travel time from the galactic center @xmath83 gyr .",
    "the hvs can be used to probe the population of stars near the cbh in the milky way s recent past . the most plausible mechanism for creating hyper - velocity stars such as",
    "the hvs is a strong gravitational interaction with the milky way s cbh , perhaps as a member of a short - period binary that was disrupted by the tidal field of the cbh @xcite as such , the existence of the hvs implies that young stars must have been present within @xmath84 of the cbh @xmath83 gyr ago .",
    "there is observational evidence for even younger stars with ages of @xmath85 currently orbiting the cbh @xcite at distances of @xmath86 .",
    "the existence of such stars is puzzling , as strong tidal interaction with the black hole should prevent local star formation ( but see @xcite and @xcite ) , and yet these stars are unlikely to live long enough to be scattered into such close orbits .",
    "thus the existence of young stars near the cbh today @xcite , along with the inference from the hvs that they were also present @xmath83 gyr ago , may suggest that the mechanism for delivering young stars to the cbh must be efficient and continuous , which may in turn constrain the various models for such delivery @xcite . if the hvs migrated to near the cbh from outside , its expected ms lifetime ( @xmath87 gyr ) , implies the migration time must be @xmath88 gyr .    assuming that the hvs is the ejected component of a binary that was tidally disrupted by the cbh",
    ", we can use its known mass and ejection velocity to place constraints on the properties of original binary , and on companion s current orbit about the cbh ( see also @xcite ) . assuming a mass for the companion @xmath89",
    ", we can determine that initial separation of the binary @xmath90 , and the peribothron @xmath91 and eccentricity @xmath92 of the companion s orbit around the cbh @xcite .",
    "we find that the eccentricity of the bound star s orbit is always high , ranging from @xmath93 to @xmath94 as an increasing function of @xmath89 .",
    "the binary separation @xmath90 and @xmath91 increase with @xmath89 . for a companion with @xmath95 ( i.e.  an equal - mass binary ) ,",
    "we find @xmath96 au , @xmath91=72.8 au and @xmath92=0.98 .",
    "the semimajor axis of the bound star s orbit about the cbh is @xmath97 au .    the period of the companion of the hvs about the cbh will be of the order of @xmath98 yr .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath99 main - sequence star at the galactic center would have @xmath100 , over a magnitude fainter than the faintest stars for which accurate orbits are being measured in near - ir imaging studies of the galactic center using @xmath101-class telescopes @xcite . as a result , unless it happens to be near peribothron and massive , the companion to the hvs will probably be difficult to find .",
    "assuming tidal disruption of binaries is the mechanism by which most hvs are formed , it may be difficult to link an observed hvs with its orbiting stellar companion .",
    "the fact that the hvs is an spb star implies that it should be possible to study its properties in more detail with follow - up observations using asteroseismology .",
    "spb stars show multi - periodic variability , with secondary period amplitudes that are of the same order as that of the primary period .",
    "this variability is thought to be due to non - radial g - mode pulsations @xcite .",
    "hence , the hvs should be targeted for more photometric data in order to unravel the possible different pulsation modes . matching these g - modes would give additional and precise information about the properties of the star .",
    "we are specially interested in hvs s age , since an independent measurement from asteroseismology would provide further evidence of its origin and history across the galaxy .",
    "we would like to thank andy gould for helpful discussions , warren brown , margaret geller , and scott kenyon for useful comments on the manuscript , and barbara mochejska for help with the sm plotting package .",
