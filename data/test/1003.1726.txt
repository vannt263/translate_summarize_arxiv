    "electrostatic interactions of charged macromolecules and colloids are often governed by small oppositely charged ions ( counterions ) that maintain global electroneutrality .",
    "these counterion - mediated interactions play a fundamental role in classical charged ( coulomb ) fluids that are abundant in biological and soft matter context @xcite and include many charged macromolecules ( such as nucleic acids dna and rna , actin filaments , microtubules and globular proteins ) , affecting their functional , structural and dynamical behavior . in spite of the importance of electrostatic interactions , there is no general method that would allow for an accurate prediction of electrostatic effects in all regions of the parameter space , defined by the surface charge density of macroions , charge valency of counterions , dielectric mismatches between the often hydrophobic core of the macromolecule and the surrounding aqueous medium , etc .",
    "often the electrostatic interactions are treated on the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) level leading to effective interactions which turn out to be always repulsive between like - charged macromolecules .",
    "conceptually , the pb approach corresponds to a mean - field treatment of electrostatic interactions and is asymptotically valid only for sufficiently large separations between macromolecules , low enough surface charge densities and low counterion valency @xcite .",
    "it characterizes a situation where electrostatic fluctuations and correlations due to the counterions are negligible .",
    "there are other regions in the parameter space of charged macromolecules where one expects the mean - field framework to break down leading to the emergence of a completely different non - pb - type physics .",
    "a notorious example is the phenomenon of like - charge attraction , which emerges between highly charged macroions or in the presence of high valency counterions and has been at the focus of both experimental @xcite and theoretical investigations in recent years ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for an extensive reference list ) .",
    "it appears to us that among the most important recent advances in this field has been the systematization of non - pb effects based on the notions of _ weak coupling _ ( wc ) and _ strong coupling _ ( sc ) approximations .",
    "these terms refer to the strength of electrostatic coupling in the system and may be understood conceptually in terms of the electrostatic interactions of mobile counterions with fixed external charges ( macroions ) in the system when compared with direct electrostatic interactions between the counterions themselves .",
    "this latter contribution may be characterized in terms of the _ bjerrum length _ , @xmath0 which corresponds to the separation at which two unit charges , @xmath1 , interact with thermal energy @xmath2 in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath3 ( in water and at room temperature , the value is @xmath4 nm ) . if the charge of the counterions is @xmath5 then the bjerrum length scales as @xmath6 .",
    "the interaction of counterions with macroion charges ( of surface charge density @xmath7 ) can be characterized in terms of the so - called _ gouy - chapman length _ ,",
    "@xmath8 which gives the separation at which the counterion - surface interaction energy equals @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of these two fundamental length scales introduces a dimensionless parameter @xmath9 which is known as the ( netz - moreira ) electrostatic coupling parameter @xmath10 @xcite and quantifies the strength of electrostatic coupling in the system .",
    "this parameter is closely related to the plasma parameter of ionic systems @xcite and may be written also in terms of the typical lateral spacing , @xmath11 , between counterions in the proximity of a charged surface , i.e. , @xmath12 as set by the local electroneutrality condition @xmath13 .",
    "it then follows that in the weak coupling regime , defined by @xmath14 , the width of the gouy - chapman layer @xmath15 is much larger than the separation between two neighbouring counterions in the counterion layer and thus it behaves basically as a three - dimensional gas .",
    "each counterion in this case interacts with many others and the collective mean - field approach of the poisson - boltzmann type is thoroughly justified . on the other hand , in the strong coupling regime , defined by @xmath16 ,",
    "the mean distance between counterions , @xmath11 , exceeds the layer width and thus the counterion layer behaves essentially as a two - dimensional layer @xcite . in this case",
    "the mean - field approach breaks down as each counterion is isolated laterally in a relatively large correlation hole of size @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , as each counterion can move almost independently from the others along the direction perpendicular to the charged surface , the properties of the system are dominated by single - particle contributions on the leading order , which is in stark contrast with the collective mean - field picture and emerges as a direct consequence of strong electrostatic correlations in the system .",
    "the two dychotomous limits are characterised by a low ( high ) valency of the counterions , a small ( large ) value of the surface charge density and/or large ( small ) medium dielectric constant .",
    "conceptually the study of the sc regime has been pioneered in several recent works @xcite using various analytical methods .",
    "it was shown @xcite that both the wc and the sc limits may be described analytically as two exact _ limiting laws _ from a single general theory for classical coulomb fluids : while the pb theory follows in the limit of @xmath17 , a limiting single - particle sc theory follows in the limit @xmath18 , which thus allow for an exact statistical mechanical treatment of charged systems at two opposed limiting conditions",
    ". the parameter space in between can be analyzed by approximate methods @xcite , being accessible effectively only _ via _ computer simulations @xcite .",
    "exact solutions for the whole range of coupling parameters are available only in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the wc - sc paradigm has been tested extensively @xcite and was found to describe computer simulations quantitatively correctly in the respective regimes of validity , thus providing a unifying view of the behavior of coulomb fluids .",
    "the main facets of these results are retained even when the model system is generalized in order to include more realistic features describing the bathing solution or the nature of the fixed or mobile charges in the system .",
    "though , for instance , multipolar charge distribution of mobile counterions @xcite or statistically disordered distribution of fixed charges @xcite unavoidably introduce novel features in the counterion - mediated electrostatic interaction , the application of the same general philosophy embodied in the weak and strong coupling limits remains sound and valid .",
    "the only case where it needs to be amended in an essential manner is when the bathing solution contains a mixture of univalent as well as polyvalent salts , which incidentally are also the most common experimental conditions . in that case",
    "a more sophisticated mixed weak - strong coupling analysis is in order leading to qualitatively different results @xcite .    though originally formulated in the context of planar macroions , these advances have transpired also in the dna - like models of polyelectrolytes which deal with electrostatic interactions in the context of macroions with cylindrical or indeed helical fixed charge distribution .",
    "indeed this particular variant of counterion - mediated interactions has a venerable history @xcite . during the last two decades several distinct analytical approaches aimed in different directions improved the classical pb results for simple dna - like models and revealed the importance of correlation effects as well as several other factors including the discrete or helical charge distributions , chain flexibility , finite molecular size , and dielectric inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "guided by these developments we set ourselves the goal of systematically analyzing the interactions between cylindrical macroions mediated by mobile counterions in the presence of dielectric inhomogeneities .",
    "contrary to the case of planar macroions which can be completely characterized by a single dimensionless coupling parameter , cylindrical macroions require in general two dimensionless coupling parameters that consistently describe the range of validity of the strong and weak coupling approximations . the existence of two coupling parameters is due to the simple fact that , if compared to the planar case , the cylinder has a finite radius that needs to enter the fundamental description of the problem .",
    "this other dimensionless parameter brought fourth by cylindrical geometry of the macroion is nothing but the so - called _ manning parameter _ @xcite . for a cylinder of radius @xmath19 and linear charge density @xmath20 ,",
    "it is given by @xmath21 the manning parameter thus represents the dimensionless linear charge density or , on the other hand , also the rescaled radius of the cylindrical charge distribution .",
    "note that the two parameters ( i.e. , @xmath10 and @xmath22 ) in the cylindrical geometry are independent and can be set separately . for double - stranded dna ( @xmath23 ) , the manning parameter and the ( netz - moreira ) electrostatic coupling parameter are given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( at room temperature in water ) in terms of the counterion valency @xmath26 .",
    "in this paper we will analyze systematically the interactions between two cylindrical macroions characterized by a fixed surface charge density as well as a finite dielectric jump between the external dielectric background ( corresponding to a continuum solvent ) and the hydrophobic cores of cylindrical macroions .",
    "analytically derived results in both limits of strong and weak coupling will be compared directly with monte - carlo simulation results .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : we first introduce our model and study the image - charge effects within the problem of a single charged cylinder with neutralizing counterions in section [ sec : one_cyl ] .",
    "we then focus on the interaction between two identical charged dielectric cylinders within the wc and the sc theory as well as mc simulations in section [ sec : two_cylinder ] .",
    "the results in the presence and absence of dielectric discontinuity at the cylindrical boundaries are analyzed in detail in order to bring up the effects due to the image charges in the two - cylinder geometry .",
    "let us focus first on the problem of a single infinitely long uniformly charged cylindrical macroion of radius @xmath19 .",
    "the charge of the cylinder is assumed to be distributed uniformly on its surface according to the charge distribution function @xmath27 with @xmath20 being the absolute _ linear _ charge density and @xmath28 the radial coordinate from the cylinder axis .",
    "the cylinder is arbitrarily chosen to be negatively charged and its electrical charge is thus neutralized by positively charged mobile counterions of valency @xmath29 , which are present in the region @xmath30 only .    in general ,",
    "the interior of the cylindrical macromolecule can be characterized by a different dielectric constant @xmath31 than the surrounding continuum solvent medium , @xmath3 .",
    "this is certainly the case for dna that has a hydrophobic inner core composed mostly of stacked nitrogen bases that have a vastly different dielectric response from an aqueous solution @xcite .",
    "other charged polymers that usually do not share structural features with dna can nevertheless also posses hydrophobic inner cores with a local dielectric response that differs from the one of the solvent .",
    "the hydrophobic apolar core of the macromolecular backbone would then have a static dielectric constant @xmath32 ( hydrocarbon ) , while the surrounding continuum dielectric medium which is usually water , a polar associated liquid , would be characterized by @xmath33 .",
    "one can thus introduce the dielectric discontinuity parameter @xmath34 which measures the relative dielectric mismatch at the interface of the two materials . in a dielectrically homogeneous system",
    ", we have @xmath35 and no image charge effects are present , while , for instance , in water - hydrocarbon systems , one has @xmath36 , which suggests strong image charge effects ( note that @xmath37 and the largest value for @xmath38 is obtained when one medium is ideally polarizable , i.e. , is an ideal metal ) .",
    "therefore , a single cylinder can be described by three different dimensionless parameters , namely , the electrostatic coupling parameter @xmath10 , the manning parameter @xmath22 and the dielectric discontinuity parameter @xmath38 as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xicouple ] ) , ( [ eq : xi_m ] ) and ( [ eq : jump ] ) , respectively .",
    "the presence of a dielectric inhomogeneity across the boundary of the cylinder , see fig .",
    "[ fig : model_1cyln ] , influences the electrostatic potential that can be thus described by the green s function connecting two points @xmath39 outside the cylinder as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the direct standard coulomb kernel in the absence of dielectric inhomogeneities , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the  image correction \" due to the dielectric jump just as in the case of a planar discontinuity .",
    "unfortunately in cylindrical geometry the concept of kelvin image charges , that plays such a fundamental role for planar dielectric discontinuities , is a bit diluted since the image correction can not be in general formulated in a way that would entail a summation of properly positioned point image charges .",
    "we nevertheless consistently refer to the effects of dielectric inhomogeneities in this system as dielectric image effects .",
    "if explicitly stated we believe this inconsistency in nomenclature can not be a source of confusion .    instead of using the concept of point image charges one must in fact",
    "explicitly solve the poisson equation in cylindrical geometry specified by cylindrical coordinates @xmath44 with appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the cylinder , which requires the normal component of the electric field to fulfill the following relation @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the cylinder surface charge density . solving the poisson equation with the proper eigenfunction expansion @xcite",
    "one can express the image part of the green s function as @xmath47 with the following definition @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the angle and height differences between the position vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 are the modified bessel functions of the first and the second kind that enter the eigenfunction expansion @xcite .    having derived the appropriate green s function for the cylindrical geometry , we now investigate the behavior of counterions in proximity to a charged dielectric cylinder in the two limits specified by the weak and strong coupling approximations that can be treated analytically .",
    "the behavior at intermediate coupling strengths will be analyzed by using extensive mc simulations .",
    "as noted before , the wc regime is characterized by a small coupling parameter @xmath14 , which is adequate for low valency counterions , small surface charge , high temperature or high solvent dielectric constant . in the strict limit of @xmath17 , ignoring the usually small fluctuations around the mean field configuration , the system is described exactly by the mean - field pb theory @xcite .",
    "formally the pb equation corresponds to the saddle - point condition imposed on the action field - functional in this limit @xcite .",
    "for the present system , the pb equation governing the mean electrostatic potential takes the form @xmath55 where the right - hand side is obviously the number density of the counterions , i.e. @xmath56 note that due to axial symmetry and translational invariance in the @xmath57 direction , the problem is reduced to a one - dimensional formulation with @xmath58 and the solution of the pb equation depends only on the radial coordinate @xmath28 .",
    "the analytical solution of the pb equation in this case is well known and was first discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite within the so - called _ cell model _ where the cylindrical macroion is confined ( coaxially ) in an outer cylindrical boundary of radius @xmath59 .",
    "the cell model guarantees a finite solution for the counterion density despite the extremely slowly varying ( logarithmic ) electrostatic potential in two dimensions .",
    "the solution of the pb equation for the counterion density takes different forms depending on whether the manning parameter is larger or smaller than a threshold value given by @xmath60 $ ] @xcite .",

    "it is also independent of the dielectric jump parameter , @xmath38 , due to the axial symmetry which implies that the electrostatic field vanishes inside the cylinder .",
    "the absence of dielectric discontinuity effects is specific to the mean - field limit where no fluctuations are taken into account and can be derived also in the case of planar slabs @xcite .",
    "when the manning parameter is decreased , the system exhibits a continuous counterion condensation transition @xcite at a critical manning parameter @xmath66 .",
    "the nature of this transition has been analyzed throughly by means of analytical and numerical methods @xcite .",
    "it was in particular shown that the behavior close to the transition point is described by the mean - field theory and fluctuation and correlation effects ( that will be important eventually at sufficiently large manning parameters ) play no role at the transition point . here",
    "we shall not consider the behavior of counterions close to the transition point but do note that since the image - charge effects are absent in the mean - field limit , such effects are expected to have no influence on the counterion condensation transition itself .    in",
