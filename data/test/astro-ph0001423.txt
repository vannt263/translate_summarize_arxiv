    "during 19971998 the number of x  ray pulsars found in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) rapidly increased from three ( smcx1 , rxj0053.87226 , and 2e0050.17247 ; lucke et al 1976 ; hughes 1994 ; israel et al .",

    "the source 2e0101.57225  was detected at a nearly constant flux level in all the _ einstein _ , _ rosat _  and _ asca _  pointings which surveyed the relevant region of the smc ( see hughes & smith 1994 ) , but pulsations were not found due to poor statistics . based on the accurate position obtained with the _ rosat _  hri , these authors found that 2e0101.57225  is very likely associated with a be spectral  type star ( r.a.=01@xmath903@xmath101386 , dec.=7209141 ; equinox j2000 ) .",

    "the smc field including the position of the 2e0101.57225  was observed by the narrow field instruments ( nfis ) on board the _ beppo_sax  satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997a ) on 1998 july 2627 ( effective exposure time of 40320s ) .",

    "were extracted from a circular region of 4  radius ( corresponding to an encircled energy of @xmath090% ) around the x  ray position .            a 4  extraction radius ( @xmath085% encircled energy ) was also used for the lecs in order to minimize the contamination from the soft x  ray emission of the bright nearby source 2e0102.37217 .",
    "the local background was measured in a region of the mecs and lecs images far from any detected field sources .",
    "the arrival times of the @xmath01500 photons were corrected to the barycenter of the solar system and background subtracted light curves were accumulated in 0.5s bins .",
    "a single power spectrum was calculated over the entire time span covered by the observation in order to maximize the sensitivity to coherent pulsations .",
    "significant power spectrum peaks were searched for using the algorithm described in israel & stella ( 1996 ) . a highly significant peak ( @xmath09.4@xmath13 based on the fundamental only",
    "; see upper left panel of fig.1 ) was found at a frequency of 0.002889hz , corresponding to a period of 345.2s .",
    "an accurate determination of the period was obtained by fitting the phases of the modulation over 4 different intervals of @xmath016000s each .",
    "the scatter of the phase residuals was consistent with a strictly periodic modulation at the best period of 345.2@xmath140.3s ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "a comparison of the 14kev ( panel s in fig.1 ) and 410kev ( panel h ) folded light curves provides marginal evidence for an energy dependent pulse profile : nearly sinusoidal at low energies , while double  horned above 4kev . however",
    "the pulsed fraction ( semi  amplitude of modulation divided by the mean source count rate ) of @xmath045% is constant over the two energy intervals considered .",

    ", we fitted the _",
    "rosat _  and _",

    "we found that the two component model derived above again gave the best fit ; a @xmath16=23/25 was obtained for a photon index of 1.1@xmath140.1 with n@xmath19 of 3.9@xmath25@xmath210@xmath22cm@xmath11 and a black body temperature of 0.12@xmath26kev corresponding to an equivalent black body radius r@xmath27 in the 260 km range ( see fig.2 ; 1@xmath13 uncertainties ) .",
    "the corresponding power spectrum shows no significant ( 3@xmath13 confidence ) peak in the 339359s period interval with a @xmath060% upper limit on the pulsed fraction .",
    "the field including 2e0101.57225  was observed by the nasa advanced x  ray astrophysics facility satellite _ chandra _   on 1999 august 23 with the imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et al .",
    "1992 , bautz et al .",
    "1998 and references therein ) in the high  resolution imaging mode for an effective exposure time of 19551s .",
    "the source was detected at an off  axis angle of about 9  in the s4 ( front illuminated ) ccd of the acis ",
    "s detector with a count rate of @xmath09@xmath210@xmath11 ct s@xmath4 ( in the 0.510kev energy range ; see fig.3 left panel ) .",
    "the source shows two emission peaks separated by @xmath05 .",
    "however the size of the emission region is comparable with the 90% encircled energy region of a source at 9  off  axis angle .",
    "we extracted a 3.24s binned light curve of the source from a region within 8   from the center of the emission : r.a.=01@xmath903@xmath101406 , dec.=72091525 ( equinox j2000 ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainty radius is only @xmath00.5  but at this stage the uncertainty in the absolute positioning at such an off  axis angle might be as large as 90 .",
    "however the detection of the pulsations clearly associates the _ chandra _  source with that of _ beppo_sax .",
    "we also note that the _ chandra _  coordinates are consistent with the _ rosat _  hri uncertainty circle and differ by less than 2  from those of the proposed optical counterpart ( see below ) making the association very likely . according to the _ chandra _  source naming convention we designated it as cxoj010314.1720915 .",
    "a single power spectrum was calculated over the entire observation .",
    "the search was performed over a period interval around that detected by _ beppo_sax  and assuming a maximum @xmath28p@xmath28 of @xmath03 s yr@xmath4 which translates into a search over only two fourier frequencies ( see fig.1 lower panels ) .",
    "a peak was detected at a significance level of 7.5@xmath13 .",
    "a refined period was determined by means of the phase fitting technique ; this gave a value of 343.5@xmath140.5s ( see table1 ) .",
    "we note that the _ chandra _  data were not corrected to the barycenter of the solar system . however , for a relatively long period pulsar in the direction of the smc , the effect of the spacecraft and of the earth motion , would cause a maximum correction of a factor of 10 smaller than the statistical uncertainty of the period given above .",
    "the pulse profile is sinusoidal ( over the whole _ chandra _",
    "energy band ) and the pulsed fraction is @xmath045% ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this result implies that the pulsar is continuing to spin  up at a constant rate of 1.7syr@xmath4 since 1996 ( see fig.1 ; right panel ) .    in order to further address the issue of the double peaked _ chandra _  image ( see fig.3 ) , we extracted two separate light curves for each of the two peaks .",
    "we found that the signal at 343.5s was present with a similar pulsed fraction in both light curves ; this result is consistent with the hypothesis of a point  like source .",
    "an independent confirmation was also obtained through a raytracing simulation , encompassing a monochromatic source ( 1.49kev ) and models for the mirror assembly and acis detector .",
    "the results indicate that expected psf at an off  axis angle of 9  is artificially elongated in the direction connecting the two peaks detected in the chandra image around the position of 2e0101.57225 ; the two peaks are probably artefacts resulting from the small number of x  rays in the image .",

    "moreover , the association of the companion with a be spectral  type star makes 2e0101.57225  the first example of a persistent ( main sequence ) be / x  ray binary system in the smc .",
    "2e0101.57225  is also a relatively low  luminosity ( 10@xmath510@xmath3ergs@xmath4 ) x  ray pulsar .",

    "since the derived corotation radius @xmath35 is @xmath08@xmath210@xmath34 cm , the @xmath33 is considerably smaller than @xmath35 , and accretion on the surface of the neutron star proceeds unaffected by the magnetosphere s centrifugal drag , as long as the luminosity of the source is larger than @xmath02@xmath210@xmath5ergs@xmath4 . such a luminosity is not unusual for a bright x  ray pulsar in a nearly circular orbit around a giant ob companion star where the intense stellar wind continuously supplies matter to the compact object . assuming a main sequence star , an orbital period of @xmath0300d",
