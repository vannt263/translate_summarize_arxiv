    "@xcite , an antiproton implanted in a heavy nucleus serves as an attractor for surrounding nucleons that can lead to a sizable increase of the central nucleon density .",
    "this effect is caused by the strong attractive scalar and vector potentials acting on the antiproton , as follows from the @xmath1-parity transformation of nuclear potentials @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the antiproton also creates an attractive potential acting on nucleons .",
    "this leads to the concentration of nucleons around the antiproton and , as result , to a considerable increase of the nucleon density .    within the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model ,",
    "the @xmath1-parity transformed nuclear optical potential is about @xmath2 mev at the normal nuclear matter density @xmath3 @xmath4 , while a phenomenological value of an antiproton optical potential is limited within the range of @xmath5 mev @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to fit the empirical optical potential , the antiproton coupling constants with @xmath6- , @xmath7- and @xmath8-meson fields should be reduced with respect to the values given by the @xmath1-parity transformation .",
    "the rmf calculations with reduced coupling constants @xcite still show quite strong compressional effects for light and medium nuclei .",
    "an important question , which arises here is whether the compression process is fast enough to develop before the @xmath9-annihilation .",
    "the total @xmath10-annihilation cross section in vacuum can be parameterized at low relative velocities @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 mb and @xmath14 mb@xmath15c @xcite . using these numbers",
    "we can estimate the life time of an antiproton inside the nuclear matter at normal density : @xmath16 this is , of course , a very short time in nuclear scale .",
    "however , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , this time can become much longer , up to 20 fm / c , for deeply bound antiprotons due to the phase space suppression factors .",
    "therefore , the compression effects can , in - principle , show up in @xmath9-nuclear interactions .",
    "in the present work , we apply a dynamical transport model in order to study the formation and decay of the compressed @xmath9-nuclear system .",
    "our calculations are based on the giessen boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( gibuu ) model @xcite , which has been recently supplemented by the relativistic mean fields @xcite .",
    "apart from collision terms , the gibuu model solves the coupled ( through the mean fields ) vlasov equations for nucleon and antiproton phase space distribution functions .",
    "as well known @xcite , the vlasov equation provides a semiclassical limit of the time - dependent hartree - fock calculations .",
    "thus , the compressional effects found in refs .",
    "@xcite should also be reproduced as a static solution of the coupled vlasov equations .",
    "it will be demonstrated that the compression process is characterized by the time scale which is comparable with the @xmath9 life time in nuclear environment .",
    "thus , @xmath9 has , indeed , a chance to annihilate inside the compressed nucleus .",
    "we will show , that the @xmath9-annihilation in a compressed nucleus should lead to the collective expansion of the residual nuclear system .",
    "the appearance of the high - energy tails in the kinetic energy spectra of the emitted nucleons is predicted .",
    "the distributions in the total invariant mass of produced mesons reveal a noticeable shift toward lower invariant masses , when the annihilation takes place inside the compressed nucleus .",
    "the annihilation of slow antiprotons inside heavy nuclei was , first , proposed by rafelski @xcite as a unique opportunity to study nuclear matter in unusual conditions .",
    "later , cahay et al .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath9 annihilation inside nuclei within an intranuclear cascade model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , antiproton annihilation events into pions at the center of @xmath17ca and @xmath18ag nuclei were simulated .",
    "the mean field effects were , however , completely neglected in @xcite .    in sect .",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical model applied in calculations . sect .",
    "iii contains the results of the time evolution study for the compression and explosion dynamics . in sect .",
    "iv , we propose several observable signals sensitive to the @xmath9-annihilation in the compressed nucleus .",

    "instead , we enforce @xmath9 to annihilate into mesons at some preselected time ( see sect . iie ) .",

    "however , it is more convenient to propagate in time the test particle kinetic momenta rather than the canonical ones , since then eq .  ( [ kgeqsigma ] ) for the @xmath6-field decouples from eq .",

    "we have neglected the time derivatives of the meson fields in eqs .",
    "( [ kgeqsigma]),([kgeqomega ] ) .",
    "however , the spatial derivatives were treated without any simplifying assumptions .",
    "the reason for such a strategy is that we are dealing with nuclear systems which have large density gradients , but evolving slowly , as compared with the spatial and temporal scales involved in the mesonic equations of motion . indeed , including the temporal gradients would lead to the frequent oscillations of the mesonic fields with a period of less than @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the meson mass",
    "this gives the period of 2.5 fm / c ( 1.5 fm / c ) for the @xmath6- ( @xmath7- ) field . by taking into account the finite wave lenghts of these oscillations",
    "would further reduce the periods .",
    "the treatment of such oscillations would strongly complicate the numerical calculations , in - particular , due to the classical meson field radiation .",
    "on the other hand , the characteristic periods of the oscillations are significantly smaller than the characteristic compression times ( @xmath0 fm / c , see sect .",

    "contributes to the three - momentum density @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "although eqs .",
    "( [ eqsigma]),([eqomega ] ) are not covariant , they provide a better description of the nuclear surface than pure local fields @xcite .",
    "this improves the stability of a nuclear ground state and is more appropriate for studying nuclear response to external hadronic and electromagnetic probes .",
    "equations ( [ eqsigma]),([eqomega ] ) have been solved numerically by applying the alternating direction implicit iterative method of douglas described in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the scalar density dependence on the effective mass",
    "( see eqs.([mstar]),([rhosj ] ) ) , additional iterations are needed to solve eq.([eqsigma ] ) .",
    "in other words , the scalar density has to be computed selfconsistently . to evaluate the meson fields",
    ", we used a uniform grid in coordinate space with steps @xmath91 .",
    "for the systems @xmath9@xmath92o , @xmath9@xmath17ca and @xmath9@xmath93pb considered below , the grid covered a cubic volume with the side of 10 , 20 and 30 fm , respectively , centered at the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) of a @xmath9a system . by numerical reasons , the @xmath94-functions in coordinate space , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) , have been replaced by the gaussians of the width @xmath95 : @xmath96 the width of the gaussian and the grid step sizes are pure numerical parameters which should resolve the coordinate space nonuniformities of the system . in our case",
    "the characteristic space scale is given by the radius of the smallest considered nucleus @xmath92o , i.e. @xmath97 fm .",
    "on the other hand , in order to have smooth density distributions , the number @xmath76 of test particles per physical particle ( see eq . ( [ tp ] ) ) should be correlated to the width of the gaussian as @xmath98 .",
    "this puts a restriction on too small width due to cpu time increase . as an optimum choice",
    ", we fixed in the present work @xmath99 fm .",
    "we have realised , however , that there is a rather moderate tendency of increasing maximum compression ( see discussion in sect .",
    "iii a below ) with decreasing gaussian width .",
    "the number of test particles per nucleon was set to @xmath100 in the most of calculations .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ rdot]),([pstardot ] ) have been solved by applying the second - order in time predictor - corrector method @xcite with the time step of 0.1 fm / c .",
    "this value is small enough to resolve the time scale of a few fm / c for the compression processes ( see figs . [",
    "fig : rho_u_vs_z ] and [ fig : rho_vs_t ] below ) .",

    "equation ( [ cohstate ] ) implies , that the antiproton is at rest .",
    "the width of the initial antiproton distribution in momentum space is @xmath104 , which follows from the uncertainty relation .",
    "if not mentioned explicitly , the calculation is done with the choice @xmath105 fm .",
    "this value agrees with results of the static rmf calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite . as for nucleons ,",
    "the antiproton df ( [ cohstate ] ) is projected onto test particles according to eq .",
    "( [ tp ] ) with the @xmath94-functions in coordinate space replaced by gaussians . to avoid misunderstanding",
    ", we note that one should distinguish the width @xmath103 of the physical antiproton spatial distribution in eq .",

    "in such a way , the evolution of the system toward compressed state has been followed . in this calculation , the collision term in the r.h.s . of the kinetic equation ( [ kineq ] ) has been set to zero , i.e. we considered a pure mean - field vlasov dynamics .",
    "this was done to see most clearly the role of the mean fields .",
    "an introduction of the @xmath106 and @xmath107 elastic collisions would mainly lead to a dissipation of the collective energy into heat . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this effect is rather small and , therefore , can not change significantly the compression dynamics .",
    "the reason is , that the elastic collisions are not frequent on the time scale of compression ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : rho_u_vs_z ] , [ fig : rho_vs_z ] and [ fig : rho_vs_t ] ) .",
    "indeed , the mean time @xmath108 between nucleon - nucleon collisions can be estimated as @xmath109 , where @xmath110 mb is the elastic nucleon - nucleon cross section ( c.f .",

    "the experimental data are described reasonably well , except for the momenta @xmath129 gev / c , where the calculations significantly overestimate the data .",

    "we see that the initial configuration is unstable and the system starts to shrink .",
    "both nucleon and antiproton central densities grow quite fast , reaching their maxima within several fm / c . in the course of the compression process , the nucleon potential becomes deeper in the case of the reduced antiproton coupling constants ( @xmath40 ) and does not , practically , change in the @xmath1-parity motivated case ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "the antiproton potential deepens quite strongly with time for the both sets of the antiproton coupling constants .    in the case of @xmath40 ,",
    "the first maximum of the central nucleon density ( @xmath160 @xmath4 ) is reached at @xmath161 fm / c . at later time",

    "the small oscillations of the central density in the compressed system visible at @xmath167 fm / c are approximately of the same amplitude as the oscillations of the respective ground state .",
    "thus , the reason for these small amplitude oscillations is the fermionic ground state instability due to the classical treatment of particles @xcite . in principle",

    "@xcite or by adding a friction force to the hamiltonian equations of motions for the test particles @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "one can also notice ( see lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] ) a peculiar feature of the @xmath9@xmath93pb system : the dip in the central nucleon density at @xmath168 fm / c .",
    "this is mostly a consequence of the delayed shape equilibration mentioned above in discussing fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_z ] . the especially strong density drop for @xmath40",
    "is partly caused by the symmetry loss due to the finite number of test particles .",

    "[ fig : rho_u_vs_z ] and [ fig : rho_vs_z ] ) .",
    "since the compression time is of primary importance , we have also studied the sensitivity of our results to the width @xmath103 of the initial antiproton df ( [ cohstate ] ) .",
    "we have found , that for a larger ( smaller ) width the compression time becomes somewhat longer ( shorter ) . in - particular , for the @xmath9@xmath92o system at @xmath159 the time needed to reach the first density maximum is 5 fm / c ( 2.5 fm / c ) for @xmath170 fm ( @xmath171 fm ) .",

    "the value of the maximum density reached in the compression process is practically insensitive to @xmath103 .",
    "we have to admit also , that there is some numerical uncertainty in our calculations due to the choice of the width @xmath95 of the test particle gaussian and the grid step size .",
    "e.g. in the calculation with @xmath172 fm for the lightest system @xmath9@xmath92o the maximum and saturation densities are @xmath173 % higher than in calculation with @xmath99 fm . setting the smaller grid step is not feasible for technical reasons .",
    "overall , this numerical uncertainty is comparable to the one due to different choices of the scaling factor @xmath174 in our calculations .",

    "@xmath114 have been chosen : they correspond to ( i ) the early ( @xmath175 ) annihilation from a non - compressed ground - state nucleus , ( ii ) the annihilation at the time moment when the first maximum of the central density is reached , and ( iii ) the late annihilation from an asymptotic compressed configuration .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] , that the annihilation from a non - compressed ground state nucleus ( thin solid lines ) does not lead to significant expansion of the residual nuclear system .",
    "the central nucleon density stays always below but close to @xmath45 in this case . in the case of annihilation from the compressed configurations ( thick solid and dash - dotted lines ) , we observe that , for the light systems @xmath9@xmath92o and @xmath9@xmath17ca , the central nucleon density decreases sharply after annihilation and reaches values well below @xmath45 .",
    "this is a clear indication of the collective expansion of a system from the initially compressed state . on the other hand , for the heavy @xmath9@xmath93pb system",
    ", the expansion is not very pronounced at any choice of the annihilation time .",
    "it is interesting , that if the annihilation is switched on at the first density maximum ( thick solid lines ) , then after an abrupt falling down the central density stays for some time @xmath176 fm / c close to @xmath45 before decreasing further .",
    "this is explained by an inertial compression : after annihilation , the periphery of a residual nucleus still continues to move to the center during some time until rebound . in the case of the @xmath9@xmath17ca system , this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : vrad_ca40_xip03 ] and [ fig : vrad_ca40_xip1 ] , where we show the baryon density and the radial collective velocity , @xmath177 at several times as a function of the radius @xmath178 .",
    "the collective velocity has been determined as @xmath179 at @xmath180 fm , the evolution of the radial collective velocity field is noticeably influenced by the fermionic ground state instability discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , one can still observe the inertial compression . indeed",
    ", the radial collective velocity at @xmath181 fm / c for @xmath40 and at @xmath182 fm / c for @xmath159 reveals the fast outward motion at the center , while the peripheral nucleons still continue to move to the center .",
    "this explains plateaus in the central density evolution near @xmath183 fm / c in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] . at @xmath184 fm / c the whole system starts to expand .",
    "this is reflected in the monotonically increasing radial collective velocity with radius .",
    "the especially strong rise of @xmath185 at large @xmath178 is due to emission of fast particles . at later times @xmath186 fm / c the expansion is replaced by the inward motion of the matter in the central zone .",
    "however , the fast particles are still continuing to escape from the dense region .",
    "we expect that in reality the system will break - up into fragments before the inward motion will start ( see discussion sect .",
    "it is presently well established ( see @xcite and refs . therein )",
    "that nuclear matter at low densities ( @xmath187 ) becomes unstable with respect to small density perturbations , so called spinodal instability .",
    "however , in order these density perturbations to develop into nuclear fragments , the system must stay long enough time @xmath188 fm / c in the spinodal region .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] , that the light systems @xmath9@xmath92o and @xmath9@xmath17ca spend a long time in this region .",
    "therefore , the residual nuclear systems can undergo a multifragment break - up , if the annihilation happens in the compressed configurations .",
    "in other words , the multifragment break - up of nuclei after the @xmath9-annihilation may serve as a signal of the compression prior the annihilation .    in table [",
    "tab : fragmenting_source ] we collect the estimated parameters of fragmenting sources for the @xmath9@xmath92o and @xmath9@xmath17ca systems .",
    "the case of @xmath9-annihilation from the state of maximum central density is considered here ( see thick solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] ) .",
    "the sources have been determined by selecting nucleons in the space region where the baryon density is larger than @xmath189 .",
    "they are characterized by the neutron ( @xmath190 ) and proton ( @xmath191 ) numbers , the collective kinetic energy per nucleon ( @xmath192 ) and the residual excitation energy per nucleon ( @xmath193 ) .",

    "the collective kinetic energy ( [ e_kin^coll ] ) is calculated neglecting pressure effects . due to the initially isospin - symmetric nuclei and the neglect of the isovector mesons in the lagrangian density ( [ lagr ] )",
    ", we obtained in all cases @xmath199 in the source .",
    "it turned out also , that the coulomb interaction optionally included in some of the calculations does not change this result .",
    "thus , only the charge numbers @xmath191 are given in table [ tab : fragmenting_source ] .",
    "the time moment for determination of the source parameters has been chosen at @xmath200 fm / c , when the central nucleon density is about @xmath201 , i.e. inside the spinodal region .",
    "the calculated residual excitation energy is typically @xmath202 mev / nucleon that corresponds to the temperatures @xmath203 mev . according to the statistical multifragmentation model @xcite , in this energy domain",
    "the multifragment break - up is the dominating decay channel of residual nuclei .",
    "the collective kinetic energy is @xmath204 mev / nucleon in the case of @xmath9@xmath92o .",
    "this is well above the coulomb energy of the source , which is only about 0.4 mev / nucleon for @xmath205 .",
    "unfortunately , such a source is too small to experience the real multifragment break - up , rather a fermi break - up into small clusters @xcite . in the case of larger sources , produced in @xmath9@xmath17ca annihilation",
    "the collective kinetic energy is considerably smaller , @xmath206 mev / nucleon , but still significant with respect to the total coulomb energy @xmath207 mev / nucleon for @xmath208 .",
    "thus , we expect some signs of collective expansion to be visible in kinetic energy spectra of produced fragments .",
    "let us now consider other observable effects .",
    "[ fig : ekin_spectra ] shows the c.m .",

    "emitted nucleons from the bound nucleons of a residual nucleus , we used a simple criterion : only those nucleons , both protons and neutrons , were included in the spectra which are separated by at least 3 fm from the other test particles of a given parallel ensemble at @xmath163 fm / c .",
    "one can see , that nucleons with the kinetic energy @xmath209 , where @xmath210 mev is the fermi energy of the nuclear matter at @xmath45 , are abundantly emitted .",
    "such nucleons are knocked - out from the nucleus by the mesons produced after the annihilation @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tab : slopes ] we list the slope parameters @xmath211 of the nucleon kinetic energy spectra obtained by the maxwell - boltzmann fit @xmath212 in the region of @xmath213 mev .",
    "we would like to mention , that the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite report the slope temperature of about 60 mev for the kinetic energy spectrum of the emitted protons in the case of @xmath9@xmath17ca system , which is not so far from our results for the annihilation in the ground - state nucleus at @xmath175 .",
    "we want to emphasize that the kinetic energy spectra of nucleons emitted after the @xmath9-annihilation from the compressed @xmath9@xmath92o , and @xmath9@xmath17ca systems are significantly harder than the spectra of nucleons from the annihilation at @xmath175 .",
    "this can be explained by two effects .",
    "first , the collective expansion of the outer shell will increase the slope temperature , typically , by several mev ( see table [ tab : fragmenting_source ] and figs .  [",
    "fig : vrad_ca40_xip03 ] , [ fig : vrad_ca40_xip1 ] ) .",
    "second , just after the annihilation the nucleon potential at the center of a nucleus grows suddenly by @xmath214 mev .",
    "this creates an additional push for the fast nucleons emitted from the nucleus .",
    "although the hardening effect is most pronounced for the lightest system @xmath9@xmath92o , it is also quite visible for @xmath9@xmath17ca . for the heaviest system @xmath9@xmath93pb , we observe almost identical high energy tails of the nucleon spectra for the different annihilation times .",
    "the reason is that the collective expansion is practically absent in this system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_t ] ) .",
    "also , the yield of fast nucleons is reduced by their subsequent rescatterings in the residual nucleus .",
    "the meson production from the @xmath9-annihilation inside nucleus is influenced both by the mean field via the potentials of the annihilating pair and by the final state interactions ( fsi ) , i.e. the two - body collisions and resonance decays .",
    "it is instructive to disentangle the contributions of the mean field effects from the rescattering and absorption effects . to this aim",
    ", we have performed additional calculations by subsequently switching off the fsi and the mean field .",
    "corresponding results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pimul_pbaro16],[fig : pimom_pbaro16 ] and [ fig : minv_spectra_pbaro16 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : pimul_pbaro16 ] shows pion multiplicity distributions for the @xmath9@xmath92o system . in the case of reduced antiproton coupling constants ( @xmath40 ) , the mean field alone does not produce any noticeable modification of the pion multiplicity distribution .",
    "on the other hand , fsi leads to a rather substantial shift toward smaller @xmath215 .",
    "for the case of @xmath159 , we observe a strong pion multiplicity reduction due to smaller @xmath115 for the @xmath116 annihilation , while the fsi effects are much weaker .",
    "one can also see a quite significant compressional effect for @xmath159 , which is only very weak for @xmath40 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pimom_pbaro16 ] , we present charged pion momentum spectra in the c.m .",
    "frame of the @xmath9@xmath92o system .",
    "fsi strongly modifies these spectra , mostly due to the @xmath152 processes , which effectively decelerate pions . as we have already observed earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig : ekin_spectra ] , emitted nucleons gain energy , correspondingly .",
    "the effect of the baryonic mean field on the pion momentum spectrum is relatively moderate : we observe some depletion of the high - momentum tail , which is more pronounced in the case of @xmath159 .",
    "the compressional effect is visible in the reduction of the pion yield in the momentum range @xmath216 gev / c .",
    "this can be understood from figs .",
    "[ fig : pimom_ppbar ] and [ fig : pimul_pbaro16 ] : in vacuum , the events with @xmath217 and @xmath218 contribute substantially to this momentum range , while the probability of such events is substantially suppressed in a compressed nucleus due to the reduced annihilation phase space @xcite .",
    "the pion momentum spectrum has clearly the two components : the slow pions , which have undergone rescatterings via the @xmath30-resonance excitation ( @xmath219 less than about 300 mev / c ) , and the high energy pions , which were emitted from the system almost without secondary interactions .",
    "the similar result has been obtained in earlier intranuclear cascade calculations @xcite . following ref .",

    "the baryonic mean field leads to the shift of a peak position toward smaller @xmath230 and to some broadening of the distribution .",
    "the broadening is due to the spatial spread of the initial antiproton df ( [ cohstate ] ) , which results in different mean - field potentials acting on different annihilating @xmath9n test particle pairs .",
    "additionally , the fsi leads to a very strong broadening of the invariant mass spectrum due to the deceleration and absorption of the annihilation mesons .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : minv_spectra_pbaro16 ] for the case when the rmf was switched off ( dotted line ) .",

    "another clear signature of the nuclear compression is the hardening of the kinetic energy spectra of emitted nucleons . on the other hand ,",
    "the invariant mass distribution of produced mesons is shifted to smaller invariant masses due to the in - medium reduction of the nucleon effective mass at high scalar density .",
    "similar phenomena are expected also for the case of @xmath233-nucleus bound states which can be produced via the @xmath234 reaction on nuclei .",
