    "energetic electromagnetic radiation is emitted by a wide range of astrophysical objects , such as supernova remnants ( snrs ) @xcite , microquasars @xcite and gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite .",
    "this radiation is at least partially attributed to the synchrotron- or synchrotron jitter emissions @xcite of ultra - relativistic electrons , which gyrate in strong magnetic fields .",
    "such extreme conditions do not exist in the interstellar medium and probably not in astrophysical jets or in snr blast shells , if their plasma would be in a steady state .",
    "efficient electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification mechanisms must be at work and they are driven primarily by collisionless plasma shocks @xcite .    through their interaction with the electromagnetic fields in the shock transition layer",
    ", the electrons may gain enough energy to be injected into the diffusive shock acceleration process @xcite .",
    "the latter is probably capable of accelerating charged particles to the highest observed cosmic ray energies and it should supply a population of highly relativistic electrons .",
    "the apparent magnetization of snr shocks @xcite is attributed to cosmic ray - driven instabilities , which can operate on large scales @xcite .",
    "filamentation instabilities of counterstreaming beams of charged particles are thought to be the origin of the micro - scale magnetic fields , in particular of those in grb jets @xcite , although the lifetimes of these fields might be too short @xcite .",
    "filamentation or beam - weibel instabilities develop in an initially spatially uniform system of two counter - streaming particle beams .",
    "typically one examines this instability in the reference frame , in which the net charge and current vanish .",
    "the beams consist of electrons and ions and they may contain a sizeable fraction of positrons in grb jets .",
    "the filamentation instability transforms the spatially uniform beams into a system of spatially separated current flux tubes , which are enwrapped and separated by electromagnetic fields [ 13 - 17 ] .",
    "observations of the filamentation instability in laboratory settings and the therefrom resulting electromagnetic radiation exist @xcite and they are likely to occur close to shocks @xcite in astrophysical settings .    the weibel instability @xcite is another magnetic instability .",
    "it is driven by a thermal anisotropy of a single electron species .",
    "weibel considered in his original work a spatially uniform bi - maxwellian electron velocity distribution .",
    "the electrons were cooler along one direction than along the other two .",
    "the weibel instability gives rise to the aperiodic growth of magnetowaves with a wavevector that is parallel to the cool direction @xcite and with wavelengths that are comparable to an electron skin depth .",
    "the weibel instability has been widely examined in the past both analytically and numerically [ 21 - 30 ] .",
    "its importance for the generation of magnetic fields in jet outflows and on a cosmological scale has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "it has , however , previously been unclear how a strong thermal anisotropy could form and survive over spatial scales that exceed the wavelength of the modes , which are destabilized by the weibel instability in its original form @xcite .",
    "such a process has been identified recently @xcite .",
    "a plasma density gradient together with the high electron mobility gives rise to an ambipolar electrostatic field , which confines the electrons and accelerates the ions .",
    "the electric field vector is antiparallel to the density gradient .",
    "the ion acceleration launches a rarefaction wave [ 33 - 38 ] .",
    "the electrons , which move from the dense plasma to the front of the rarefaction wave , are slowed down and reflected inelastically by the electric field of the expanding wave , through which they provide the energy for the ion acceleration .",
    "the modulus of the electron momentum along the density gradient is reduced by these processes , while both orthogonal momentum components are unchanged .",
    "the thermal anisotropy can give rise to the weibel instability . in what follows",
    "we refer to it as the thermal anisotropy - driven weibel instability ( tawi ) .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite have shown that the tawi can magnetize a planar plasma cloud that expands into a vacuum .",
    "a shock develops , if the rarefaction wave expands into a dilute ambient medium .",
    "the tawi is suppressed if a shock is limiting the extent of the rarefaction wave to a length that is shorter than the wavelength of its modes @xcite .",
    "this process , which requires ion density gradients and hot electrons , can be important for energetic astrophysical plasma .",
    "the internal shock model for the prompt grb emissions assumes that the jet consists of plasma clouds with varying densities and mildly relativistic relative speeds @xcite .",
    "we can also assume that the ion density close to snr shocks will not be spatially uniform .",
    "the bulk electrons in the grb jets are thought to be relativistically hot and the bulk electrons close to snr shocks have kev temperatures . the magnetic energy generated by the tawi can reach a sizeable fraction of the electron thermal energy , which could result in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the tawi has previously been examined numerically in a two - dimensional planar geometry .",
    "a plasma slab is centred in these studies in the simulation box and confined by two parallel boundaries , across which the density jumps from the constant high density within the slab to a low density or a vacuum outside of it .",
    "the plasma density is constant along the second simulation direction and the boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "the rarefaction waves launched at both boundaries move into opposite directions , causing an expansion of the slab plasma .",
    "the density gradients of both rarefaction waves are antiparallel .",
    "an electron can cross the slab many times and its momentum component along the density gradients remains decoupled from both orthogonal ones .",
    "multiple electron reflections , which reduce only the electron momentum component along the plasma density gradient , result in an increasingly strong thermal anisotropy , which may exaggerate the strength of the tawi .",
    "we examine here with a pic simulation the expansion of an initially unmagnetized circular plasma cloud .",
    "the electron momentum can in this case not be subdivided into a component that is always parallel to the density gradient and into two components orthogonal to it , unless the electron moves exactly in the radial direction .",
    "this case is unlikely .",
    "consecutive electron reflections by the electric field of the rarefaction wave will diminish different momentum components and the anisotropy between the temperature in the radial and azimuthal directions is not boosted by multiple reflections .",
    "the purpose of our simulation study is to assess if the slowdown of the electrons in the sheath potential alone is still strong enough to trigger the tawi .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "the ambipolar electric field accelerates the protons in the simulations to a few percent of @xmath0 .",
    "a tawi develops within the density gradient of the rarefaction wave .",
    "this instability is similar to that observed in ref .",
    "it drives radial current channels , which yield the growth of a transverse magnetic ( tm ) field component .",
    "the growth of the tm wave is followed by that of a secondary te magnetowave .",
    "the rotational polarization of this te wave is concluded from the simultaneous presence of in - plane magnetic vortices and out - of - plane magnetic fields that interfere with those driven by the tawi .",
    "the combined magnetic field of both waves breaks the circular symmetry of the rarefaction wave and scatters rapidly the electrons within , thereby reducing their thermal anisotropy .",
    "the instability saturates in our simulation , when the total magnetic energy density is about 1% of the electron thermal energy .",
    "the te and tm magnetowaves develop in the same radial interval , which suggests their connection .",
    "we propose that the superposition of the electric field , which is induced by the magnetic field of the tawi , with the radial electric field of the rarefaction wave triggers the growth of the te wave by the misalignment of the plasma density gradient and the electric field vector .",
    "such a system is unstable @xcite and it results in an instability similar to a thermoelectric instability .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",

    "figure [ fig7 ] has demonstrated that the magnetic field energy density is increased in the radial interval , in which we find a strong thermal anisotropy in the electron distribution .",

    "we have examined here the expansion of an initially unmagnetized circular plasma cloud into a vacuum by means of a 2d3v pic simulation .",
    "the purpose of our study has been to test , if a thermal anisotropy - driven weibel instability ( tawi ) can also develop in curved rarefaction waves .",
    "previous studies considered planar plasma slabs that expanded under their own thermal pressure @xcite and observed the growth of strong magnetic fields in the rarefaction wave , unless a shock suppressed the tawi @xcite .",
    "a thermally anisotropic electron distribution develops due to two reasons .",
    "firstly the slow - down of the electrons in the ambipolar electric field implies that their thermal pressure is decreased along the density gradient .",
    "this mechanism occurs in planar and curved rarefaction waves .",
    "secondly , the inelastic reflection of an electron by the expanding rarefaction wave implies that it looses momentum along the electric field direction .",
    "this momentum is transferred to the accelerating ions . the initial plasma distribution used in the refs .",
    "@xcite is a plasma slab of infinite extent in one direction , which has a finite width in the second direction .",
    "this plasma slab is immersed in a vacuum or in a low - density plasma .",
    "both plasma boundaries are parallel .",
    "this implies that every reflection of the electron will decrease the same momentum component , namely the component that is aligned with the antiparallel density gradients of both rarefaction waves . the anisotropy increases with every electron reflection .",
    "this mechanism can not occur in a circular rarefaction wave , since here consecutive electron reflections tend to decrease different momentum components .",
    "our study can thus test if consecutive electron reflections are necessary to achieve a tawi .",
    "if the slowdown of the electrons in the ambipolar electric field of a plasma with a spatially non - uniform density is enough to trigger the tawi , then this instability may play a role in the magnetization of astrophysical plasma @xcite besides the filamentation instability @xcite and cosmic ray - driven instabilities @xcite .",
    "the magnetic energy that can be generated by the tawi is a fraction of the electron thermal energy , here about 1% .",
    "this energy density is well below that of the filamentation instability , which can reach about 10 - 20% of the kinetic energy density of leptonic beams if they are cold .",
    "however , the tawi requires only hot electrons and a density gradient to grow , while the filamentation instability is triggered by relativistic particle beams that we may find only close to plasma shocks .",
    "the tawi could thus magnetize much larger intervals in energetic astrophysical jets , such as grb jets , which are thought to have a nonuniform plasma density and relativistically hot electrons .",
    "the tawi may also generate a seed magnetic field in the turbulent plasma close to snr shocks and speed up the development of the much more powerful cosmic ray - driven instabilities .",
    "our findings are as follows .",
    "the electron expansion results in a strong radial electrostatic field .",
    "it counteracts a further electron expansion and accelerates the protons into the radial direction .",
    "a rarefaction wave emerges , which is characterised by an increase of the proton mean speed and by a decrease of the proton density with an increasing radius .",
    "the expansion of a rarefaction wave is self - similar @xcite .",
    "the absence of an ambient medium has prevented the formation of a shock and the protons could reach a speed exceeding 250 times their thermal speed .",
    "the fields within the rarefaction wave have initially been electrostatic .",
    "electrons lose momentum to the accelerating protons only in the radial direction , which implies that their radial thermal pressure decreases more quickly than the azimuthal one .",
    "a thermal anisotropy - driven weibel instability ( tawi ) @xcite grows once the radial extent of the rarefaction wave is sufficient to accommodate a wavelength of the unstable modes @xcite and once the thermal anisotropy between the radial and the azimuthal direction became sufficiently large .",
    "the tawi results in the aperiodic growth of a transverse magnetic ( tm ) wave .",
    "this tm wave induces an electric field that is added to that of the electrostatic ambipolar electric field of the rarefaction wave .",
    "the total electric field is thus no longer parallel to the plasma density gradient .",
    "a misalignment between the electric field and the plasma density gradient can drive circularly or elliptically polarized magnetowaves @xcite .",
    "we propose that these waves are responsible for the in - plane magnetic field we observe in our simulation , which can not be explained in terms of the tawi .",
    "the magnetic fields of this wave reach an amplitude that is comparable to the waves due to the tawi .",
    "our findings can be verified in an experiment , where the absorption of a laser pulse heats up the electrons in a thin wire @xcite .",
    "some electrons will leave the now positively charged wire and build up an ambipolar electric field .",
    "this ambipolar field accelerates the ions through the transverse normal sheath acceleration ( tnsa ) mechanism @xcite and it results in the formation of a rarefaction wave .",
    "the ablation of a wire generates a cylindrical rarefaction wave .",
    "our circular plasma cloud corresponds to an idealized cross section of the wire , as long as it is sufficiently far away from the laser impact point @xcite .",
    "the cross section is idealized , because we do not consider ionization processes that require more elaborate numerical codes @xcite .",
    "the plasma dynamics outside of the wire should be comparable in the simulation and experiment .",
    "the strong magnetic fields that develop in the rarefaction wave should be detectable .",
    "it is thus possible to investigate systematically the tawi in a controlled laboratory experiment and to determine the strength and life - time of the magnetic field .",
    "the interplay of the tawi with the secondary magnetowave we have observed here and other instabilities , such as the rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite , can also be examined .",
    "the experiment can reveal the topology of the magnetic fields in a three - dimensional setting , which is currently computationally too expensive .",
