    "the leading idea is that collective behaviors of a society composed by a sufficiently large number of individuals ( agents ) can be hopefully described using the laws of statistical mechanics as it happens in a physical system composed of many interacting particles .",

    ", we will show that the time - evolution driven by this equations leads the density towards a equilibrium state that is described in terms of two dirac masses ( @xmath4 ) or to a unique dirac mass ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "the recent analysis of @xcite of the nonlinear friction equation introduced by mcnamara and young @xcite , suggests that a suitable way of treating equation ( [ magnet ] ) is based on a rewriting of this equation in terms of pseudo - inverse functions .",
