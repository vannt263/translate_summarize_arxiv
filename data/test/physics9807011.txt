    "the spatiotemporal dynamics of semiconductor lasers can be simulated successfully by semiclassical maxwell - bloch equations without including any quantum effects in the light field ( for an overview of the theory and modeling see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the classical treatment of the light field is justified by the high intensity of the laser light well above threshold . however , the incoherent noise required by the uncertainty principle in both the electrical dipole of the semiconductor medium and the light field itself is of significant importance when several cavity modes compete or when the laser is close to threshold .",
    "photon rate equations for multi - mode operation of semiconductor lasers show that the spontaneous emission terms may contribute significantly to the spectral characteristics of the light field emitted by the laser @xcite .",
    "such models assume a fixed mode structure determined entirely by the empty cavity",
    ". this assumption does not apply to gain guided lasers and to unstable resonators , however @xcite . in these cases",
    "it is therefore desirable to explicitly describe the spatial coherence of spontaneous emission .",
    "the spatial coherence of spontaneous emission and amplified spontaneous emission is even more important in devices close to threshold or devices with a light field output dominated by spontaneous emission such as superluminescent diodes and ultra low threshold semiconductor lasers @xcite .",
    "ultra - low threshold lasers may actually operate in a regime of negative gain where spontaneous emission is the only source of radiation @xcite .",
    "a description of the light field emitted by such devices therefore requires an explicit description of the spatial coherence in spontaneous emission as well .",
    "an approach to the consistent inclusion of the quantum noise properties of the light field in the dynamics of semiconductor laser diodes using nonequilibrium green s functions has been presented in @xcite . in this approach , the linear optical response of the medium",
    "is varied as a function of the time - dependent electron - hole distributions .",
    "although the non - equilibrium green s function presents an elegant solution for the description of many - body effects@xcite , the representation of the interband dipole dynamics by green s functions causes a non - markovian memory effect which is difficult to handle and is therefore usually neglected @xcite . moreover , the need to determine the green s function corresponding to the dynamically varying carrier distribution requires a computational effort far greater than that required for the integration of the corresponding maxwell - bloch equations .",
    "therefore , as stated in @xcite , an exact analytical investigation of the spatial mode structures in realistic cavities using non - equilibrium green s functions is out of reach . in order to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of multi mode operation , of lasers near threshold , low threshold lasers or superluminescent diodes , it is therefore desireable to formulate an alternative approach to the problem of spontaneous emission and amplified spontaneous emission in such devices which is based on maxwell - bloch equations . by including the spatiotemporal dynamics of the interband dipole in such equations ,",
    "non - markovian terms are avoided and the quantum mechanical equations may be integrated in a straightforward manner .",
    "the starting point for our description of quantum noise effects is the dynamics of quantum mechanical operators of the field and carrier system .",
    "since the operator dynamics of the carrier system have been investigated in the context of maxwell - bloch equations before @xcite and the light field equations correspond exactly to the classical maxwell s equations , it is possible to focus only on the local light - matter interaction . once the properties of this interaction are formulated in terms of the expectation values of field - field correlations , dipole - field correlations , carrier densities , fields and dipoles , the dynamics of the carrier system and the light field propagation may be added .    in section [ sec : lci ] , the quantum dynamics of the interaction between the light field and the carrier system is formulated in terms of wigner distributions for the carriers and of spatially continuous amplitudes for the light field .",
    "the equations are formulated for both bulk material and for quantum wells including the effects of anisotropic coupling to the polarization components of the light field .",
    "section [ sec : cdyn ] summarizes the effects of the dynamics of the electron - hole system in the semiconductor material .",
    "the light field dynamics are introduced in section [ sec : max ] . by quantizing maxwell s equation ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath1 introduced in section [ sec : lci ] is expressed in terms of the interband dipole matrix element .",
    "the complete set of quantum maxwell - bloch equations is presented in section [ sec : qmbe ] .",
    "based on this general formulation , specific approximate versions for quantum well edge emitting and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers are derived .",
    "the possibility of including two time correlations in the quantum maxwell - bloch equations is discussed and equations are given for the case of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers . in section [ sec : ase ] , analytical results for the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission in quantum wells as well as the spontaneous emission factor @xmath0 and the far field pattern of amplified spontaneous emission in broad area quantum well lasers are presented .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes the article .",
    "in following , we will describe the active semiconductor medium in terms of an isotropic two - band model where , for the case of the holes , a suitably averaged effective mass is taken @xcite .",
    "a generalization to more bands is straightforward . in terms of the local annihilation operators for photons ( @xmath2 ) , electrons ( @xmath3 ) , and holes ( @xmath4 ) ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the light - carrier interaction can be written as @xmath5 the operator dynamics associated with this hamiltonian are then given by    @xmath6    the discrete positions @xmath7 correspond to the lattice sites of the bravais lattice describing the semiconductor crystal .",
    "each lattice site actually represents the spatial volume @xmath8 of the wigner - seitz cell of the lattice . for zincblende crystal structure , this volume is equal to one quarter of the cubed lattice constant . in the case of algaas structures",
    "the lattice constant is about @xmath9 m and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the photon annihilation operator @xmath2 therefore describes the annihilation of a photon within a volume @xmath8 . here , we will focus on the light - carrier interaction and the quantum noise contributions responsible for spontaneous emission .",
    "for that purpose , we extend the semiclassical description by including not only the expectation values of the field and dipole operators , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , but also the field - field correlations @xmath13 and the field - dipole correlation @xmath14 . the factorized equations of motion then read    @xmath15    note that this set of equations already represents a closed description of the field dynamics . if , as in many experimental configurations , the absolute phase of the light field and dipole operators may be considered unknown , these equations are sufficient for a description of the light - carrier interaction .",
    "however , when two time correlations are of interest or in the case of coherent excitation by injection of an external laser it may also be necessary to additionally consider the dynamics of the field and dipole expectation values , i.e. , @xmath16      in the following , we will briefly discuss the implications of the factorization performed in the derivation of ( [ eq : factdyn ] ) . in order to formulate the dynamics of the light - matter interaction without including higher order correlations ,",
    "three terms have been factorized in the time derivative of the field - dipole correlation ( [ eq : factdynbcd ] ) .",
    "the factorizations are    @xmath17    no additional factorizations are necessary in the density dynamics of photons , electrons and holes .",
    "the three factorizations are based on the assumption of statistical independence between the densities of photons , electrons and holes .",
    "since we are not considering fluctuations in the particle densities , this is a necessary assumption .",
    "equations ( [ eq : fact1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fact2 ] ) separate the photon density from the carrier densities .",
    "these terms represent stimulated emission processes .",
    "therefore , a correlation of the photon density with the carrier densities would lead to a modified stimulated emission rate .",
    "below threshold , this effect will be small because the amplified spontaneous emission is distributed over many modes such that the local correlations between photon and carrier densities are weak . above threshold , the photon number fluctuations in the lasing mode cause relaxation oscillations .",
    "the photon number fluctuations are nearly ninety degrees out of phase with the carrier number fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the time averaged correlation is still negligible .    equation ( [ eq : fact3 ] ) separates the electron and hole densities .",
    "this term represents the spontaneous emission caused by the simultaneous presence of electrons and holes in the same location .",
    "although it is reasonable to assume that the high rate of scattering at high carrier densities effectively reduce all electron - hole correlations to zero , it is important to note that the interband dipole @xmath18 implies a phase correlation between the electrons and the holes .",
    "in fact , the spontaneous emission term factorized according to equation ( [ eq : fact3 ] ) originates from the dipole - dipole correlation @xmath19 . note that this term could also be factorized into the product of dipole operators @xmath20 .",
    "the dynamics of the field - field and the field - dipole correlations are then identical to the dynamics of the products of the fields and dipoles . therefore ,",
    "that factorization corresponds to the approximations of the conventional maxwell - bloch equations such as described in @xcite which do not rigorously include spontaneous emission .    generally , spontaneous emission must always arise from random phase fluctuations .",
    "these are given by the product of electron and hole densities . while the phase dependent dipole relaxes quickly due to scattering events , the carrier densities are preserved during scattering .",
    "therefore    @xmath21    is usually a good assumption in semiconductor systems .",
    "note that this assumption does fail in the case of low carrier densities and high dipole inducing fields .",
    "however , this case only occurs if the light field is injected from an external source . in semiconductor lasers and in light emitting diodes , the major contribution to the dipole - dipole correlations stems from the product of electron and hole densities . to check the statistical independence of photon , electron , and hole densities , it is also convenient to check the corresponding inequality for the three particle coherence represented by the field - dipole correlation , @xmath22    thus , if a calculation does not fulfill this requirement , particle density correlations additionally have to be taken into account .      in order to connect the light - carrier interaction to the highly dissipative carrier transport equations , it is practical to transform the carrier and dipole densities using wigner transformations @xcite .",
    "replacing the discrete density matrices by continuous ones obtained by polynomial interpolation will allow e.g.  for numerical purposes an arbitrary choice of the discretization scales , which generally will be much larger than a lattice constant .",
    "analytically , it permits an application of differential operators .",
    "physically , the particle densities are smooth functions over distances of several lattice constants .",
    "a coherence length shorter than e.g. ten lattice constants would require @xmath23 states with @xmath24 of at least one twentieth of the brilloin zone diameter . in typical laser devices ,",
    "however , the electrons and holes all accumulate near the fundamental gap at @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , it is simply a matter of convenience to define the continuous densities such that    @xmath26    these continuous functions may then be transformed into wigner functions by    @xmath27    the normalization of these wigner functions has been chosen in such a way that a value of one represents the maximal phase space density possible for fermions , that is one particle per state .",
    "since the density of states in the six - dimensional phase space given by @xmath28 and @xmath23 is @xmath29 , a factor of @xmath29 will appear whenever actual carrier densities need to be obtained from the wigner functions .",
    "however , the normalization in terms of the maximal possible phase space density is convenient because it represents the probability that a quantum state in a given region of phase space is occupied .",
    "therefore , the wigner distribution corresponding to the thermal equilibrium of a given particle density is directly given by the fermi function .    to deal with the light field dynamics in the same manner",
    ", the field and field - field correlation variables must also be defined on a continuous length scale . in order to obtain photon densities ,",
    "we define    @xmath30    finally , the dipole - field correlation must be defined accordingly , such that @xmath31 with these new definitions , the light - carrier interaction dynamics can now be expressed in a form which considers both the position and the momentum of the electrons and holes .",
    "the dynamics of emission and absorption now reads    @xmath32 \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}{\\cal e } ( { \\bf r})\\right |_{cl } & = & -i g_0\\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu_0}}{8\\pi^3}\\int d^3{\\bf k}\\ ; p({\\bf r},{\\bf k } ) \\\\",
    "\\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } p({\\bf r},{\\bf k})\\right |_{cl } & = & ig_0\\sqrt{\\nu_0}\\;\\frac{1}{8\\pi^3}\\!\\int\\ !",

    "this property of the wigner transformation retains the coherent effects in the carrier system . for the interaction of the carriers with the light field , it ensures momentum conservation by introducing a non - local phase correlation in the dipole field corresponding to the total momentum of the electron and hole concentrations involved .",
    "effectively , the integral over @xmath34 converts the momentum part of the wigner distributions into a coherence length .",
    "this coherence length then reappears in the spatial structure of the dipole field and the electromagnetic field generated by the carrier distribution .",
    "however , the coherence length in the carrier system is usually much shorter than the optical wavelength .",
    "it can therefore be approximated by a spatial delta function . here , we do this by noting that @xmath35 if the effects of the momentum shift @xmath34 in the wigner functions is neglected , the integrals may then be solved , yielding only local interactions between the carrier system and the light field :    @xmath36 \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}{\\cal e } ( { \\bf r})\\right |_{cl } & = & -i g_0\\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu_0}}{8\\pi^3}\\int d^3{\\bf k}\\ ; p({\\bf r},{\\bf k } ) \\\\ \\label{eq : endbulk } \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } p({\\bf r},{\\bf k})\\right |_{cl } & = & ig_0\\sqrt{\\nu_0}\\ ; \\left(f^e({\\bf r},{\\bf k})+f^h({\\bf r},-{\\bf k})-1\\right){\\cal e}({\\bf r}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these equations now provide a compact description of the light - carrier interaction in a three dimensional semiconductor medium , including the incoherent quantum noise term which is the source of spontaneous emission .",
    "similar equations may also be formulated for a quantum well structure by replacing the phase space density of @xmath29 with @xmath37 , reducing the spatial coordinates of the carrier system to two dimensions , and introducing a delta function for the coordinate perpendicular to the quantum well at the points where field coordinates correspond to dipole coordinates .",
    "of course , the electromagnetic field remains three dimensional , even though the dipole it originates from is confined to two dimensions .",
    "in particular , the correlation @xmath38 has both a three dimensional coordinate @xmath28 and a two dimensional coordinate @xmath39 .",
    "it is therefore useful to distinguish the two dimensional and the three dimensional coordinates . in the following ,",
    "the two dimensional carrier coordinates will be marked with the index @xmath40 .",
    "note that in some cases , both @xmath28 and @xmath41 appear in the equations . in those cases ,",
    "the in - plane coordinates @xmath42 and @xmath43 are equal , while the perpendicular coordinate @xmath44 must be equal to the quantum well coordinate @xmath45 .",
    "the equations for the interaction of the three dimensional light field with the two dimensional electron - hole system in a single quantum well subband then read    @xmath46 \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}{\\cal e } ( { \\bf r})\\right |_{cl } & = & -i g_0\\frac{\\sqrt{\\nu_0}}{4\\pi^2}\\int d^2{\\bf k}_\\parallel\\ ; p({\\bf r}_\\parallel,{\\bf k}_\\parallel)\\delta(r_z - z_0 ) \\\\ \\label{eq : endqw } \\left.\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t } p({\\bf r}_\\parallel,{\\bf k}_\\parallel)\\right |_{cl } & = &   ig_0\\sqrt{\\nu_0}\\ ; \\left(f^e({\\bf r}_\\parallel,{\\bf k}_\\parallel )       + f^h({\\bf r}_\\parallel,-{\\bf k}_\\parallel)-1\\right ) { \\cal e}({\\bf r})_{r_z = z_0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that the value of @xmath1 will usually be slightly lower than the bulk value because the overlap of the spatial wavefunctions of the electrons and the holes in the lowest subbands is less than one .",
    "the equations derived above represent the interaction of a single conduction band and a single valence band with a single scalar light field . neither the spin degeneracy of the carriers nor the polarization of the light field has been considered .",
    "since the geometry of light field emission is highly dependent on polarization effects such effects should also be taken into account in the framework of this theory . the basic interaction between a single conduction band , a single valence band and a single light field polarization",
    "are accurately represented by equations ( [ eq : bulk]-[eq : endbulk ] ) and ( [ eq : qw]-[eq : endqw ] ) . by adding the contributions of separate transitions , any many band system may be described based on these equations . in semiconductor quantum wells",
    "the situation is considerably simplified if only the lowest subbands are considered .",
    "then there are only two completely separate transitions involving circular light field polarizations coupled to a single one of the two electron and hole bands",
    ". the quantum well structure does not interact with light fields which are linearly polarized in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the quantum well .",
    "the equations for quantum wells are therefore completed by adding an index of @xmath47 or @xmath48 to each variable .",
    "the situation in the bulk system is much more involved .",
    "the transitions occur between the two fold degenerate spin 1/2 system of the electrons and the four fold degenerate spin 3/2 system of the holes .",
    "all three polarization directions of the light field are equally possible , connecting each of the electron bands with three of the four hole bands . however , since the effective mass of the two heavy hole bands is much larger than the effective mass of the light holes ( e.g.  by a factor of eight in gaas ) , only a small fraction of the holes will be in the light - hole bands ( about 6% in gaas for equilibrium distributions ) .",
    "consequently , the carrier subsystem can again be separated into two pairs of bands .",
    "however , the light field polarization emitted by the electron - heavy hole transitions in bulk material is circularly polarized with respect to the relative momentum @xmath49 of the electron and the heavy hole . since usually there is no strong directional anisotropy in the @xmath23 space distribution of the carriers , it can be assumed that one third of the @xmath23 space volume contributes to each polarization direction and the equations may be formulated accordingly .    in the following",
    ", we will assume that the wigner distributions of the two pairs of bands considered are approximately equal at all times .",
    "note that this means that hole burning effects in the spin and polarization dynamics which may occur in vertical cavity surface emitting lasers @xcite are ignored .",
    "however , such effects have been investigated in several other studies @xcite and are found to be fairly weak in some devices @xcite .",
    "the complete set of dynamical equations can now be formulated by adding the carrier dynamics and the linear part of maxwell s equations to the light - carrier interaction .",
    "modeling the carrier dynamics of a semiconductor system can be a formidable task all by itself .",
    "a number of approximations and models have been developed to deal with the effects of many - particle interactions and correlations and with the dissipation caused by the electron - phonon interactions @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we choose a simple diffusion model .",
    "many particle effects such as the band gap renormalization or the coulomb enhancement are not mentioned explicitly , but can be added in a straightforward manner @xcite .",
    "we assume that the electron and hole densities will be kept equal by the coulomb interaction , which will induce a current whenever charges are separated .",
    "therefore , it is possible to define the ambipolar carrier density @xmath50 with @xmath51 note that the two fold degeneracy of the electron and heavy hole bands has been included by choosing a density of states of @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 .",
    "this includes the assumption that the wigner distribution does not depend on the spin variable of the electrons and holes as mentioned above .",
    "the light carrier interaction of this carrier density is @xmath54 where the index @xmath55 denotes the component of the light field or dipole density corresponding to the linear polarization direction of @xmath56 . in the case of @xmath57",
    "the index @xmath55 refers to the field polarization and the second index @xmath58 denotes the vector component of the dipole vector .",
    "equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) shows how the field - dipole correlation converts electron - hole pairs into photons .",
    "the total carrier density dynamics can now be formulated as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ambipolar diffusion constant , @xmath61 is the injection current density , and @xmath62 is the rate of spontaneous recombinations by non - radiative processes and/or spontaneous emission into modes not considered in @xmath63 , e.g. if the paraxial approximation is applied .    the @xmath23 dependence of the distribution functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 may be approximated by assuming that the electrons and holes will always be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the distribution functions are then given by fermi functions @xmath66 + 1 \\right)^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath67 are the effective masses of electrons and heavy holes , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath68 is a function of the carrier density @xmath50 . a useful estimate of this relationship is given by the pade approximation @xcite .",
    "spectral holeburning may be taken into account by introducing a relaxation time @xmath69 and converting the dynamics of the distribution function due to the light - carrier interaction into a deviation from the equilibrium distribution by adiabatic elimination of the relaxation dynamics : @xmath70    finally , the carrier dynamics of the dipole @xmath71 and the dipole part of the field - dipole correlation @xmath72 needs to be formulated .",
    "since both depend on a correlation of the electrons with the holes , they will necessarily relax rather quickly at a rate of @xmath73 which should be of the same order of magnitude as @xmath74 .",
    "physically , @xmath73 may be interpreted as the total momentum dependent scattering rate in the carrier system .",
    "the remainder of the dynamics can be derived from the single particle dynamics .",
    "this unitary contribution to the evolution of the dipole may be expressed by a momentum dependent frequency @xmath75 . for parabolic bands and isotropic effective masses @xmath76",
    ", this frequency is given by @xmath77 many - particle effects due to the coulomb interaction between the carriers may be included by introducing a carrier density dependence in @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "such renormalization terms representing the mean field effects of the carrier - carrier interaction have been derived and discussed e.g. in @xcite . in the following , this many particle renormalization",
    "will not be mentioned explicitly , although it can be included in a straightforward manner .    with the rates @xmath73 and @xmath75 the dipole dynamics reads    @xmath80    note that the phase dynamics is formulated relative to the band gap frequency @xmath81 .",
    "the real physical phase oscillations of @xmath71 would include an additional phase factor of @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "however , the only physical effect of this oscillation is to establish resonance with the corresponding frequency range in the electromagnetic field , the dynamics of which we consider next .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion describing the operator dynamics of the electromagnetic field operators are identical to the classical maxwell s equations . in terms of the electromagnetic field @xmath83 and the dipole densities @xmath84 , the equation reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the dielectric constant and the speed of light in vacuum , respectively , and @xmath88 is the dielectric constant in the background semiconductor medium .",
    "maxwell s equation describes the light field dynamics for all frequencies .",

    ", energy densities have to be considered .",

    "[ beta ] illustrates , in particular , the carrier density dependence of @xmath0 for three modes with frequencies above the band gap frequency given by ( a )  @xmath246 , ( b )  @xmath247 , and ( c ) @xmath248 .",
    "most notably , @xmath0 is always smaller than the usual estimate given by @xmath249 , which is based on the assumption of ideal resonance between the transition frequency and the cavity mode .      with equations ( [ eq:1dgain ] ) and ( [ eq:1dspont ] ) , it is possible to find the steady state intensity @xmath250 of a mode with frequency @xmath170 , @xmath251 note that this result may also be obtained directly from equations ( [ eq:1ddynamics_a]-[eq:1ddynamics_b ] ) . in a wide cavity ,",
    "the cavity modes are approximately plane wave modes and the relation between @xmath252 and @xmath253 in that case reads @xmath254 the steady state intensity distribution is characterized by the spatial coherence derived from the intensity distribution of the plane wave modes of the cavity .",
    "generally , the intensity distribution of plane waves corresponds in the far field to an optical field at angles relative to the axis of emission in the plane of the quantum well .",
    "the angular distribution of intensity and coherence in the far field is thus given by @xmath255 therefore , the far field intensity distribution may be determined directly from the frequency dependence of the intensities by @xmath256 the intensity is given in units of @xmath257 per unit angle .    for @xmath258",
    "we may in analogy to ( [ eq : beta ] ) solve the integral in ( [ eq:1dspont ] ) by assuming @xmath210 to be independent of @xmath23 . as an analytical expression",
    "we then obtain for the far - field intensity distribution of a broad area semiconductor laser @xmath259 the parameter @xmath260 represents the ratio between the cavity loss rate @xmath138 and the maximum amplification rate of the gain medium .",
    "laser activity is only possible if @xmath261 .",
    "the classical laser threshold is defined by the carrier density for which the denominator of @xmath262 is zero for a single specific frequency @xmath263 .",
    "consequently , the carrier density at which this occurs is pinned .",
    "figure [ farfield ] shows the far field intensity distribution for different carrier densities below this pinning density . in fig .",
    "[ farfield ]  ( a ) , the wide intensity distribution of amplified spontaneous emission for carrier densities is much lower than the pinning density .",
    "the intensity maximum is clearly located at @xmath264 .",
    "figure [ farfield](a ) shows the intensity distribution for carrier densities halfway towards threshold .",
    "already , the intensity maxima move to angles of @xmath265 , corresponding to the frequency at which the gain spectrum has its maximum . in the case of fig .",
    "[ farfield](c ) , the threshold region is very close to the pinning density .",
    "the peaks in the far field pattern narrow as the laser intensity is increased .",
    "consequently the far field pattern indeed is a measure of the spatial coherence ",
    "similar as the linewidth of the laser spectrum is a measure of temporal coherence .",
    "it is therefore desirable to consider quantum noise effects in the spatial patterns of optical systems . in the context of squeezing",
    ", such patterns have been investigated by gatti and coworkers @xcite based on the general formulation of lugiato and castelli @xcite .",
    "the laser patterns presented here are based on the same principles .",
    "usually , however , the strong dissipation prevents squeezing in laser systems unless the pump - noise fluctuations are suppressed @xcite .",
    "the quantum maxwell - bloch equations ( qmbe ) for spatially inhomogeneous semiconductor lasers derived in this paper take into account the quantum mechanical nature of the light field as well as that of the carrier system .",
    "the only approximation used in the derivation of the intensity and correlation dynamics is that of statistical independence between the two carrier systems and the light field . in the qmbe presented here ,",
    "the effects of coherent spatiotemporal quantum fluctuations which are generally not considered in the semiclassical maxwell - bloch equations for semiconductor laser devices have thus been taken into account .",
    "the spontaneous emission term appears side by side with the gain and absorption term in the dynamics of the field - dipole correlation . in this way",
    "the spatial coherence of spontaneous emission and amplified spontaneous emission is consistently described by the quantum maxwell - bloch equations .",
    "typical features of the model have been illustrated by the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission .",
    "an example of the spatial coherence characteristics described by the quantum maxwell - bloch equations has been presented by analytically obtaining the spontaneous emission factor @xmath0 and the far field distribution for the example of a broad area edge emitting laser . in general the quantum maxwell - bloch equations derived for edge emitting and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers",
    "provide a starting point for a detailed analysis of spatial coherence patterns in diverse semiconductor laser geometries such as broad area or ultra - low threshold lasers .",
    "as explained at the end of section [ sec : qmbe ] , the field average of zero is an expression of our lack of knowledge about the actual physical field present in the laser device .",
    "this lack of knowledge could be removed by performing a measurement on the light field .",
    "for example , the phase information could be obtained by measuring the interference of the light field from the diode with light from a separate laser .",
    "a simple theoretical simulation of such a measurement is obtained by assuming that @xmath153 defines the variance of a gaussian distribution of coherent states ( gaussian p representation ) .",
    "the measurement of the actual field @xmath266 may then be simulated by randomly selecting a coherent field from this gaussian distribution .",
    "since the field and the dipole density are correlated , the statistical selection of @xmath266 shifts the dipole density average @xmath101 from zero to @xmath267 because the field has been determined with a precision equal to the quantum limit , the correlations factorize and the new values of @xmath153 and @xmath268 are given by the respective products of @xmath266 and @xmath101 .",
    "the drastic changes in the intensity distribution and in the dipole dynamics which may result from such a simulated measurement cause spatial holeburning and give rise to relaxation oscillations . by performing several stochastical simulations starting from the same initial probability distribution , the statistics of the carrier density fluctuations may be obtained .",
    "it is then possible to derive the correct linewidth enhancement factor @xmath163 as well as the relaxation oscillation sidebands directly from the dynamics of the quantum maxwell - bloch equations .",
    "an alternative approach to the problem of quantum noise is given by the langevin equations @xcite .",
    "langevin equations simulate quantum noise by adding classical noise sources which reproduce the statistical properties given by the uncertainty relations .",
    "in particular , the exponential damping terms given by the cavity loss rate @xmath138 and the dipole relaxation rate @xmath210 must be compensated by a noise input maintaining the quantum fluctuations in the field and dipole densities . for quantum well lasers ,",
    "these fluctuations are given by      note that the variables @xmath270 and @xmath271 are classical quantities in this context .",
    "the langevin equations presented in the following do not describe quantum mechanical coherent states . instead , semiclassical light fields and dipole densities are calculated with a precision violating the uncertainty relations . while the statistics thus derived correspond to the quantum statistics , the theory applied is fully classical .",
