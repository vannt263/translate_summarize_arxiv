    "wireless relay systems have been a recent subject of intensive research due to their potential of providing increased diversity , extended coverage , or flexibility in compromising system performance and complexity / power consumption .",
    "efficient relaying protocols have been developed , among which the most popular are the amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward protocols  @xcite .    to further enhance system performance ,",
    "multiple antennas are deployed on one or more nodes of cooperative relay networks  @xcite-@xcite . however , in multi - antenna systems , the optimum system structure and the resultant performance ( capacity , error rate , mean - square error , etc . ) depend heavily on the nature of channels and the channel state information ( csi ) available at the transceiver ( see  @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , research on multi - antenna relay communications has progressed from early work assuming perfect csi  @xcite@xcite to recent studies assuming more realistic partial csi  @xcite .",
    "consider a _ half - duplex _ af relay link with @xmath0 antennas ( @xmath1 ) at the source and a single antenna at both the relay and the destination .",
    "this scenario typically occurs when a traditional multiple - input single - output ( miso ) link ( without relaying ) is obstructed , and then a relay is used to maintain the link and coverage .",
    "we assume that the destination has full knowledge of the source - relay and relay - destination channels , whereas the relay and the source are only aware of the long - term statistics of the source - relay channel . relaying without instantaneous csi",
    "is commonly referred to as _",
    "noncoherent relaying_.    the above scenario has been considered in  @xcite , where the source and the relay are assumed to have the long - term _ covariance information _ of a rapidly changing source - relay channel , and the optimum source covariance to maximize the ergodic capacity is determined .",
    "however , when the _ _ mean information _ _ of a slowly varying source - relay channel is available at the source , the capacity - achieving transmission strategy remains as an open problem and is tackled in this work .",
    "mean feedback models the uncertainty in csi due to channel estimation errors , quantization errors or imperfectness of the feedback link , and is feasible in slowly varying fading channels  @xcite .",
    "channel mean and covariance feedback generally require different treatments , as they constrain the solution differently . regarding utilizing mean feedback for maximum ergodic capacity in traditional miso , the optimization method in  @xcite  @xcite is based on calculus of variations using the frchet differential , whereas in  @xcite , the expression for ergodic capacity is first obtained and then ordinary calculus is used for optimization .",
    "both methods rely on the concavity of the objective function in transmit covariance  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , such concavity can not be established in our case , and these methods do not apply .",
    "we , therefore , take a nonconventional powerful approach based on one of the stochastic orders , the _ laplace transform order",
