    "the ground state of a weak - disorder quantum hall bilayer has an exciton condensate when the total landau level filling factor @xmath0 and the semiconductor quantum wells are close together .",
    "the condensate state is characterized by spontaneous inter - layer phase coherence.@xcite condensate properties are often probed most effectively by transport experiments , both because the two - dimensional electron system is buried beneath the surface of a three - dimensional host and because these measurements probe@xcite condensate superfluidity .",
    "indeed , the presence of a condensate has been inferred on the basis of wide variety of transport anomalies.@xcite although these experiments do not directly measure the condensate order parameter , it is generally acknowledged that they do not allow plausible alternate explanations . on the other hand",
    "the transport properties of systems in which the condensate is believed to have formed have largely defied attempts to achieve fully quantitative interpretations .",
    "this conundrum is related in part to the importance of edge states in quantum hall transport@xcite and , as we explain in this paper , to the sensitivity of transport measurements to disorder and to contact properties that are not normally characterized .",
    "the description that we develop for transport in the deeply coherent regime is based on a microscopic mean - field theory of the exciton condensate state , on a scattering formulation of transport theory,@xcite and on a two - channel contact model which accounts explicitly for the two contact layers .",
    "we show that transport properties can be non - trivial even when the current is small enough that the coherence order parameter is time - independent.@xcite a simplified version of this picture with a single parameter , which we refer to as _ p - ology _ , allows for virtual occupation of a pair - breaking edge channel and can be used to provide an approximate description of the crossover between strong and weak interlayer coupling regimes .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we explain the general philosophy of our approach , which has similarities to theories of the non - equilibrium properties of both superconductors  @xcite and magnetic conductors.@xcite the edge state physics of quantum hall systems is essential to the way in which the theory is developed . indeed , the presence of edge states at the fermi level , even when the bulk is gapped , is responsible for many of the complications which make the transport anomalies difficult to describe quantitatively . in section",
    "iii we detail the landauer - buttiker theory that we use to describe transport of the mean - field - theory quasiparticles , and illustrate it by evaluating two probe conductances for systems with well developed coherence . in section",
    "iv we discuss transport in the case of a non stationary condensate , focusing on the simplest case in which both coherent and incoherent inter - layer tunneling are absent and illustrating our picture by calculating the interlayer voltage for a drag experiment with a grounded drag layer . in section v we develop _ p - ology _ , which is intended to describe the influence of weaker coherence but assumes that quasiparticle transport is still edge dominated .",
    "this phenomenology makes it clear that large longitudinal drags are always present when the hall drag voltage drops below its quantized value , as seen in experiment.@xcite sec .",
    "vi contains a summary of our main results and discusses their relationship to other ideas for explaining the transport properties of coherent bilayers .",
    "in this paper we adopt a hartree - fock - like mean - field description of the exciton condensate which is similar to the mean - field - theories used , generally successfully , to describe transport in metallic ferromagnets and superconductors .",
    "this type of theory has an @xmath1 vector order parameter constructed in our case from the pseudospin-@xmath2 layer degree of freedom , and an associated pseudospin effective magnetic field which arises from microscopic exchange interactions . for a typical bilayer with weak single - particle tunneling , the exchange field exceeds the single - particle symmetric - antisymmetric level splitting , @xmath3 , by many orders of magnitude .",
    "@xmath3 is therefore normally negligible in the description of the quasiparticle properties .",
    "the dynamics of the order parameter , on the other hand , is described by a landau - lifshitz - like equation which depends only on an external field term proportional to @xmath3 , on other terms proportional to order parameter derivatives and on transport currents.@xcite ( characteristic length scales then emerge from a comparison of @xmath3 and the coefficients of the order - parameter derivative terms . ) the @xmath3 term must be present@xcite to allow consistently for the net interlayer charge transfer which occurs in many transport experiments .    typical electrical measurements performed on a coherent quantum hall bilayer involve establishing a source to drain voltage bias which injects transport quasiparticles , and measuring local electrochemical potentials at positions along the sample perimeter .",
    "when the quantum hall effect is well developed the transport quasiparticles are localized at the sample edges .",
    "electrochemical potential measurements therefore often reflect properties of the bulk condensate somewhat indirectly .",
    "contacts to the coherent bilayer resemble normal metal - superconductor junctions , at which normal currents are converted into supercurrents .",
    "this conversion between normal current and supercurrent is accomplished via andreev scattering .",
    "a similar conversion process occurs in a coherent bilayer ; even for vanishingly small single - particle tunneling a quasiparticle that has a definite layer quantum number in the leads becomes coherently mixed between the layers far away from the leads .",
    "the order parameter exchange field provides a broken symmetry contribution to the quasiparticle hamiltonian with a large inter - layer tunneling amplitude .",
    "this process does not violate charge conservation since an excitonic supercurrent is always launched to compensate@xcite for charge transfer between layers . when the condensate is described collectively , the full system of equations consists of a landau - lifshitz - like equation for the condensate with a _ pseudospin - transfer _ torque@xcite term to account for normal current to exciton super current conversion , combined with a transport theory for quasiparticles influenced by the condensate .",
    "the two sets of equations need to be solved self - consistently . at low temperatures ,",
    "inelastic scattering is weak and quasiparticle transport can be described using the landauer - buttiker formalism .",
    "application of this picture is complicated in coherent quantum hall bilayer systems by the role of chiral edge states , which can carry nearly dissipationless currents by a mechanism completely different from superfluidity .",
    "two signature properties of coherent bilayers are i ) the quantization of hall drag resistance at @xmath4 ( the hall resistance is quantized whether measured in the layer in which current is flowing or in the layer in which no current flows ) , and ii ) the absence of longitudinal drag at filling factor @xmath5 per layer . together",
    "the two properties suggest that a quantum hall effect is established at a filling factor related to the combined densities of the two layers , and that the quasiparticle current flows coherently through both layers ; there is no layer dependence in chemical potential measurements .",
    "because of the quantum hall effect , and its associated bulk gap , the bilayer coherent quasiparticles must flow at the sample edges .",
    "since these properties are normally measured in samples in which @xmath3 is extremely small , the quasiparticle current in the drag layer must be exactly compensated by a condensate counterflow supercurrent .",
    "we will be interested in analyzing transport both in four - probe geometries , which include voltage - probe contacts in addition to the current source and drain contacts , and in two - probe geometries in which the additional voltage probe contacts are absent .",
    "as we explain , some interesting information about the system can be obtained from two - probe measurements .",
    "one interesting issue that arises in the two - probe case concerns a theory of the maximum conductance possible when source and drain contacts are connected to opposite layers .",
    "our analysis relates two - probe conductances to the influence of the condensate on electron scattering near the contacts , information which will prove helpful in analyzing four - probe experiments .",
    "an appropriate microscopic model for the _ normal _ contact region in which interlayer coherence is absent plays an essential role in our analysis .",
    "we assume that the active area of the bilayer in which coherence is established is incompressible and surrounded by a single current - carrying edge state channel shared between the two layers.@xcite    as a convenience we imagine the leads as consisting of narrow hall bars with separate @xmath6 states in the two layers and associated ingoing and outgoing states which can be viewed as being located to some degree on opposite edges of these leads .",
    "we recognize that this is a somewhat idealized model of the incoherent bilayer contacts , but believe that it is general enough to capture all the essential physics .",
    "the contacts are indeed realistically viewed as narrow hall bars , but the filling factors in each layer depends on the device layout , especially on the arrangement of the main top and bottom gates.@xcite because there is a single channel in the active region , however , we can in principle always identify a linear combination of lead channels into which electron waves incident from the sample are transmitted and also a linear combination of lead channels which is responsible for all transmission .",
    "the incoming and outgoing channels in the leads in our model should be understood as represented these sample - dependent channels . with this understanding ,",
    "even if other channels are present they do not contribute to transport .",
    "when the temperature @xmath7 , this description should apply on the bilayer @xmath8 hall plateau , which can in principle extend over the filling factor range @xmath9 . at finite temperatures",
    "there will always be corrections due to thermally excited mobile bulk carriers , and these corrections will be small over a narrower filling factor range .",
    "the single edge state in the active area is a certain coherent superposition of the top and bottom edge states , to be specified more completely below . under most circumstances the quasiparticles have equal weight in the two layers corresponding to the pseudospin order parameter lying in the @xmath10-plane .",
    "the phase relationship between quasiparticle components in the two layers is dictated by the local direction of the pseudospin effective zeeman field .",
    "occupied edge states therefore add to the condensate strength .",
    "this picture is summarized schematically in  fig.[fig : edgestates ] .",
    "occupation of the orthogonal quasiparticle state with the opposite interlayer phase would be pair breaking , _",
    "i.e. _ it would weaken the condensate .",
    "this state has higher energy and does not participate in low temperature , low bias - voltage transport .",
    "later we consider the possibility of virtual occupation of the pair - breaking edge - state channel when the condensate is weak .",
    "coherent quantum hall bilayer .",
    "the normal region has two layers , each with a left - going and right - going channel that can transmit electrons toward or away from the coherent layer . on a @xmath6 plateau",
    "the coherent region supports a single edge channel with an inter - layer phase relationship that is dictated by the local condensate phase .",
    "shaded regions schematically represent places where scattering in the contacts takes place . like a ferromagnet , and unlike a @xmath11 superconductor , the ordered region has conducting quasiparticles . unlike typical ferromagnets , the conducting pseudospins are localized at the sample edge and share the same pseudospin state , in the jargon of magnetism the system is half - metallic . ]",
    "disorder gives rise to a random potential difference between edges which mixes edge state channels .",
    "this can give rise to memory of the layer from which an electron has been injected that persists along the edge .",
    "when layer memory is important for the electrical measurements we need to employ a different formulation of the scattering transport theory which has a larger number of free parameters .    the description of scattering at a junction separating two incompressible states , one representing the contact arms taken to have @xmath12 , and one representing the active area having @xmath8 , represents a new and interesting example of the application of landauer - buttiker transport theory to the qhe@xcite regime . in this case",
    "the two arms can be alternatively thought of as a combined system with two edge states , or as two separate leads attached to the bulk . in coherent bilayer transport experiments current is often injected into or drained from only one layer .",
    "we model separate - contacting to a single layer simply by setting the current to zero for one of the layers . in this way",
    "one arm of the contact acts like a voltage probe and the other like a current probe . in experiment the voltage on the open layer",
    "can normally not be read externally , although our theory does predict its value .",
    "the bulk of the bilayer contains a single edge state , as is appropriate for @xmath8 .",
    "the scattering problem near a contact , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgestates ] , is then defined via transmission probabilities from the upper `` coherent '' edge state to top and bottom edge states in the arms , @xmath13 , and from top and bottom edge states into the lower coherent edge state , @xmath14 , as well as the layer - diagonal reflection probabilities ( @xmath15 ) , the cross - layer ( andreev ) reflection probabilities ( @xmath16 ) , and finally the probability for a coherent edge state to bypass a lead , @xmath17 .",
    "note that we adopt the convention that the first index of a transmission or reflection probability denotes the outgoing scattering state channel , while the second index specifies the incoming channel .    using the above scattering probabilities",
    ", one can relate the electrochemical potentials of incoming and outgoing states for the problem illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgestates ] : @xmath18 unitarity and microreversibility@xcite impose the following conditions on the scattering probabilities : @xmath19 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) demonstrate that there are only three independent scattering probabilities which fully characterize a lead / coherent sample junction .",
    "we choose these to be @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . as a convenience we will assume in our discussion that all contacts are identical ; differences between contacts",
    "could readily be accounted for in interpreting experiments if they were adequately characterized .",
    "the way a particular contact connects to the outer world specifies additional relations between ` in ' and ` out ' electrochemical potentials .",
    "for example , when the top arm is open , one has @xmath22 .",
    "this applies equally well to voltage probes .",
    "when a voltage probe is connected to the the top layer only , for example , we set @xmath22 as usual .",
    "however we also set @xmath23 . even though the bottom layer chemical potential is not _",
    "read _ externally it is still true that no current is flowing to the outside through this arm .",
    "contacts that are not layer selective are electrically connected to the same external reservoir and therefore can be represented by setting @xmath24 , whether used as simply as voltage probes or as a current source or drain . when current is allowed to flow between contact arms through an external resistor ,",
    "the difference between their chemical potentials is proportional to this current .",
    "the unitarity and microreversibility relations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) ensure that the voltage probe readings made by probes that contact both layers or either layer individually agree .    .",
    "there are a large variety of possible measurements in which two of the four contacts are used as source and drain and two as voltage probes .",
    "contacts are normally connected to only one of the two layers , as described in the text . ]    having described the scattering problem near the contacts , we can proceed to calculate various experimentally relevant quantities . in general",
    "the effective single - particle scattering problem for the quasiparticles must be solved together with equations for the condensate .",
    "( the quasiparticle mean - field hamiltonian and hence the transmission probabilities depend on the condensate configuration , which is in turn influenced by the transport currents . ) at small voltages and currents , however , we can neglect this dependence , and treat the transmissions and reflections as constants dependent on the equilibrium condensate configuration .",
    "the typical experimental setup is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . in the two - probe case",
    "the additional voltage probes are absent and it does not matter which pair of contacts we take as a source and a drain .",
    "the three reflection probabilities that characterize the contacts , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 can be determined by three independent measurements which take advantage of the freedom that the current at both source and drain can flow through only one layer or through both .",
    "we take these experiments to be _ parallel flow _ ,",
    "_ drag _ , and _ tunneling _ measurements . in _",
    "parallel flow _",
    "the layers are shorted at both source and drain . in _",
    "drag _ , current flows in from and out through the drive layer ; no current flows through the drag layer arms at either source or drain , or obviously at any voltage probes which might be present .",
    "finally , in the _ tunneling _ measurement current is injected into one layer , and extracted from the other one . in most of this paper we assume that the condensate is time independent . for tunneling experiments this requires that currents be smaller than a critical tunneling current.@xcite    we find that the parallel , drag , and tunneling linear conductances are given respectively by @xmath27 in the above expression for @xmath28 the skipping probability , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath29 , as dictated by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) .",
    "the drag conductance was evaluated for the case of a floating drag layer , _",
    "i.e. _ an uncontacted drag layer .",
    "the same expression holds in the case of a grounded drag layer with a large ( compared to the critical tunneling current ) total current flowing through the bilayer . when the drag layer is grounded , the condensate phase will be time - dependent as discussed in the next section .",
    "one might view as ideal the situation in which the two - layers behave identically , the skipping probability is small , and there is no memory of incoming layer when reflection by the active coherent region occurs .",
    "these conditions together imply that @xmath30 , @xmath31 and give ideal values for @xmath32 , and for @xmath33 .",
    "the parallel flow two - contact conductance is the usual ideal quantum hall effect value , while the drag and tunnel conductances are half as large .",
    "the maximum possible tunnel conductance is actually somewhat larger and reached at @xmath34 , when it becomes @xmath35 . for these values @xmath36 .",
    "vanishing normal reflection and maximum andreev reflection seem unlikely in semiconductor bilayers , since reflection in the same layer should be , if anything , more likely than reflection to the other layer .",
    "a more plausible extreme set of values might be @xmath30 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 which yields @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "experimental two - probe tunnel resistances in the neighorhood of @xmath41 are indeed commonly observed in coherent bilayers .",
    "even for a strong static condensate the maximum tunneling conductance is always associated with a large resistance , which can be viewed as a contact resistance . in this sense",
    "there is no ideal dissipationless josephson effect in semiconductor bilayers .",
    "the finite resistances do not necessarily , as it is often assumed,@xcite imply that the condensate is lost because of disorder and/or quantum fluctuations .",
    "we will return to this point in the the discussion section .",
    "measurements of two - probe linear conductances for several different contacting geometries can determine the numerical values of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and in this way shed light on the nature of the lead / active region junction .",
    "so far we have been concerned with problems with a time - independent condensate .",
    "there is a class of experiments , however , in which the contacting geometry and bias voltages lead to a net current flow between layers which exceeds the critical value .",
    "the interlayer current flow can either be forced by the contacting geometry , as in counterflow and tunneling experiments , or implied by quasiparticle transport theory .",
    "an example of the second case is provided by a drag experiment in which the drag layer is grounded , _",
    "i.e. _ it is connected to the drain contact rather than floating as in the classic drag experiment .",
    "the description of the two types of experiments is slightly different : in counterflow and tunneling , there _ must _ be interlayer current , and the full system of equations for the condensate and quasiparticles needs to be solved to find it , as well as the corresponding distribution of interlayer voltages . in the drag experiment with a grounded drag layer , on the other hand , there is always a current path connecting source and drain that lies in the drive layer only .",
    "however if a naive landauer - buttiker description with a time - independent condensate predicts an interlayer current larger than the condensate can deliver , there must be an interlayer voltage to ensure that almost all the current flows through the drive layer .",
    "we leave calculating the full i - v curve for tunneling experiments to future work,@xcite and concentrate here on a simpler case of a drag experiment with the drag layer grounded at the drain .",
    "we will show that the measurement of the interlayer voltage generated in this type of measurement can provide a test of the strong - coherence theory developed in the previous section .    for definiteness ,",
    "let as assume that electrons are injected into the west bottom layer in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , and extracted from both north top and bottom layers , going counter - clockwise along the sample edge .",
    "application of the landauer - buttiker formalism predicts that the current that exits through the drag ( top ) layer , @xmath45 , is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the total current through the system .",
    "when this current exceeds the critical tunneling current the condensate can not be stationary@xcite and a finite interlayer voltage , developed through interlayer polarization , should be measurable .",
    "this additional voltage will reduce the current flowing to ground through the drag layer to a value below the critical current .",
    "experimentally , the total current is quite often much larger than the critical tunneling current . in this case",
    "interlayer tunneling can be neglected altogether and the interlayer voltage can then be found from the condition that the entire current flows through the drive layer .",
    "the latter condition follows from the fact@xcite that for a non stationary condensate collective tunneling becomes an ineffective sink for condensate currents , and the interlayer resistance due to incoherent tunneling is much larger than the resistance associated with the carrying the current in the drive layer only .",
    "since we neglect real interlayer electron transfer , we can remove the time dependence of the condensate by switching to a frame rotating with the order parameter .",
    "it must be noted that the distribution of interlayer electrostatic potentials has to be calculated taking full account of a bilayer electrostatics , modified by the presence of the condensate.@xcite however , for a well developed qhe the top and bottom edges running from west to north , and from north to west must be equipotentials .",
    "moreover , the interlayer voltage must be equal at the above edges , otherwise there would be an ever - increasing counterflow from one edge to the other . in principle , this can be counteracted by counterflow decay due to real tunneling , which we take to be negligible at present , or phase slippage events,@xcite but these should not occur at small currents , since vortices are pinned . hence we conclude that the rate at which the order parameter rotates , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is its phase must be constant at the system edge , and it is this value of @xmath50 at the edge that is measured by a voltage probe as an interlayer electrochemical potential difference .",
    "the latter statement assumes that the quasiparticle dynamics is fast on the condensate time scales , thus the quasiparticles are in equilibrium with the local instant value of the condensate .",
    "now let us calculate the value of the interlayer electrochemical potential difference that is necessary for the absence of the current through the drag ( top ) layer .",
    "switching to a rotating frame corresponds to a gauge transformation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the annihilation operator in the top and bottom layers , respectively .",
    "this transformation removes the time dependence of the order parameter by shifting the electrochemical potentials in the top and bottom layers by @xmath53 .",
    "since the quasiparticles now see a time - independent spontaneous tunneling amplitude , we can apply landauer - buttiker formulae to the above shifted electrochemical potentials substituting @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chempots ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath55 remains unchanged .",
    "the electrochemical potential difference is found from the condition that there is no current flowing out of the top layer at north , and the _ unshifted _ electrochemical potential in north top arm coincides with the drain electrochemical potential .",
    "the result is @xmath56 where , as before , @xmath47 is the current flowing through the bilayer .",
    "we note that the conductance in this case is still given by the corresponding expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : conductances ] ) . the interlayer voltage , eq .",
    "( [ eq : interlayerv ] ) , depends on the same set of reflection probabilities that can be , in principle , extracted from the two - probe conductances measurements .",
    "( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conductances ] ) ) .",
    "confirmation of this prediction would provide strong confirmation that the strong coherence regime modeled in the previous section can be achieved experimentally .",
    "when the charge gap responsible for the quantum hall effect is reduced , disorder enables quasiparticles to deviate from perfect chiral routes around the sample perimeter and travel across the bulk .",
    "processes of this type , although always present at finite temperatures , are extremely weak when the quantum hall effect is well developed .",
    "the bulk scattering events which lead to deviations from a perfect quantum hall effect are normally well characterized by the value of the longitudinal resistance measured in a four - probe geometry . in this section",
    "we show that in coherent bilayers , longitudinal voltages can develop in both drag and drive layers when the current source and drain contacts are layer selective , even when transport is perfectly localized at the edge and the quantum hall effect is still perfect when the source and drain contacts are not layer selective .",
    "the longitudinal voltages emerge when interlayer coherence is weak enough to permit evanescent conduction in the _ pair - breaking _ bilayer edge channel , leading to a non - negligible layer - memory length .",
    "below we explain a model intended to describe electrical measurements in this regime , which we refer to the weak coherence regime .",
    "we start this discussion of deviations from the strong coherence case by briefly reviewing the main assumptions made in the previous section .",
    "there it was assumed that an electron arriving at a voltage probe travelled in a single chiral channel localized along the edge of the active coherent region .",
    "under such an assumption , unitarity of scattering near the probe ensures that selective voltage probes connected to either layer measure the same electrochemical potentials . on the other hand ,",
    "electrons propagating along the aforementioned edge channel could have come from either top or bottom layers of , say , an upstream current probe , and these upstream probes could have different electrochemical potentials in top and bottom layers . in order to allow for the possibility of layer memory being retained between probes , we have to weaken our assumptions about electron propagation between probes . losing _ which layer _",
    "memory is , of course , a process of quantum mechanical scattering , which happens on a certain length scale around a contact . up to now ,",
    "we have been assuming that this length scale is small , which corresponds to what we are referring to as the strong coherence regime . as coherence",
    "is weakened , say , by increasing temperature or changing the total filling fraction , one can imagine a situation when this _ which layer _ memory length becomes considerable and eventually comparable to the system size .",
    "indeed , as we explain below , there are good reasons to expect that disorder can cause this length to become comparable to sample dimensions even when the normal quantum hall effect is still reasonably well established .",
    "voltage probe readings will then depend on which layer is contacted .",
    "quasiparticle transport in this regime is most generally described by a phenomenology which allows all possible chiral transmission coefficients between neighboring two - layer contacts .",
    "the most general model consistent with a perfect @xmath6 integer quantum hall effect in the active region , when normally contacted , is one in which outgoing electrons in a lead are either reflected within the same lead or transmitted to the nearest downstream contact but satisfy the constraint @xmath57 below we will construct a one - parameter landauer - buttiker - type parameterization to describe the weak coherence regime , which is less general but physically transparent . in order to capture layer memory we need to relax the microscopic single - channel edge model for the active region edge . in order to explain the main ideas we apply this approach mostly to the case of drag experiments , although the same type of analysis could ( and has been ) applied to tunnel , counterflow , and a wide variety of other contacting arrangements .",
    "longitudinal drag always accompanies weakening coherence in bilayers , and has previously been analyzed using an effective medium theory due to stern and halperin which associates longitudinal drag with loss of coherence in the bulk of the system.@xcite we show here that longitudinal drag should still be expected even when transport currents still flow perfectly chirally at the edge of the system and the normal quantum hall effect is still accurately quantized .",
    "we expect our model to be most relevant at low temperature and small @xmath58 when the bulk effective medium theory appears to fail.@xcite our approach provides a complementary understanding of the large longitudinal drag resistances that can appear in coherent bilayers .    in what follows",
    "we assume that current is injected into and drained from the bottom layer so that the top layer is the drag layer .",
    "we assume that electrons flow counter - clockwise around the sample as in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "quantities related to the edge running from the electron source to the electron drain ( simply source and drain from now on ) are labeled with the superscript `` + '' , and those for the edge running from drain to source - with the superscript `` - '' . for the `` + ' ' ( `` - '' ) edge",

    "complications which arise when these assumptions are relaxed will be discussed below .    to describe the loss of _ which layer _ memory with a minimal set of parameters , we assume that electrons reflect in the same layer in the leads with probability @xmath61 .",
    "these values are appropriate ( dictated by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : unitarity ] ) ) near the strong coherence limit if andreev and skipping probabilities are neglected , and there is a symmetry between layers . to specify position - dependent transmissions",

    "we introduce probabilities @xmath130 for an electron to be in the locally high and low energy states in a region where @xmath131 after @xmath132 landau - zener branching events . using the branching rules we find that these probabilities satisfy @xmath133",
    "it follows that the transport quasiparticle layer polarization @xmath134 satisfies @xmath135 in the continuum limit .",
    "we identify the layer - memory loss length with the characteristic length which emerges from this analysis of polarization decay : @xmath136 since the edge magnetoplasmon velocity in large hall bar samples@xcite has a logarithmic enhancement related to the long - range of the coulomb interaction @xmath137 .",
    "furthermore @xmath72 can be @xmath138 due to weakened screening on hall plateaus , whereas @xmath127 has a maximum value @xmath138 when coherence is complete . from these estimates",
    "it is clear that the layer memory length on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : memorylength ] ) must become large as interlayer coherence is weakened , leading to longitudinal and hall voltages whenever current source or drain contacts are layer selective as explained in the previous section .",
    "these layer memory effects can in principle be separated experimentally from normal deviations from perfect quantum hall effects , also expected to become stronger when coherence weakens , by comparing measurements made with layer selective and non - selective source and drain contacts .",
    "in this article we have developed a landauer - buttiker description of quasiparticle transport in separately - contacted bilayer quantum hall superfluids . for well developed condensates",
    "we first assume that current is carried between leads by a conducting channel consisting of quasiparticles that occupy both layers simultaneously and have inter - layer phase coherence .",
    "when this assumption applies , voltages measured along the sample edge have the same value for probes that contact both layers and probes that contact either of the individual layers .",
    "we refer to this regime as the _ strong coherence _ regime .",
    "we show that two - probe conductances are then dependent on the three independent landauer - buttiker scattering probabilities that characterize the link between two - layer leads and the condensate edge . assuming that all contacts to the system are identical , these three parameters can be determined by separate two - probe conductance measurements for parallel , drag , and tunnel contacting geometries .",
    "the two - probe linear conductance values predicted in this approach tend to range from @xmath139 to @xmath140 depending on the contacting geometry and the contact scattering properties .",
    "indeed these values appear to be generally consistent with coherent bilayer experiments performed at low temperature and small @xmath58 values.@xcite at higher temperatures and larger @xmath58 conductances tend to decrease .",
    "a part of the decrease is readily accounted for by deviations from a perfect quantum hall effect due to scattering across the bulk of the sample , which is always present at finite temperature and beyond the scope of the present theory .",
    "tunnel conductances decrease more rapidly than parallel transport or two - probe drive - layer conductances in drag experiments however .",
    "this observation points to the development of layer memory in quasiparticle transport .",
    "we have therefore elaborated our strong coherence scattering formalism to allow for layer memory , which we relate microscopically to disorder at the edge and resulting evanescent transport in the pair - breaking bilayer edge - state channel .",
    "this picture leads to a layer memory length which is proportional to @xmath141 , where @xmath127 is the bulk quasiparticle gap of the coherent state .",
    "in addition to accounting for two - point tunnel geometry conductances that are much smaller than @xmath140 , this analysis shows that longitudinal drag voltages and deviations from quantized hall drag voltages develop when layer memory lengths become comparable to distances between contacts .",
    "we refer to this circumstance as the _ weak coherence _ regime . in this way we are able to establish a relationship between hall drag voltages and the longitudinal drag voltages which appear at weak coherence which is qualitatively consistent with experiment.@xcite this picture also accounts for the sign of the longitudinal drag voltage which is opposite to the sign of the longitudinal voltages in the drive layer .",
    "we have considered the transport properties of coherent bilayers in both time - independent condensate , and time - dependent condensate ( interlayer current above the critical tunneling current ) cases . in either regime",
    "measured voltages reflect the properties of fermionic quasiparticle waves at the interface between the sample and bilayer leads .",
    "when the condensate is time - dependent , differences between chemical potentials measured by leads attached to different layers can reflect mainly this time dependence , and therefore the physics which controls its value in a particular geometry .",
    "generally , the phase variation rate assumes a value sufficient to pump the required amount of current between layers via external electrical connections between layers , via inelastic quasiparticle tunneling between layers ( the mechanism which appears to dominate experimentally at large bias voltage ) , or via local dynamic fluctuations of the condensate ( as in the model used by hyart and rosenow,@xcite discussed further below ) . in some cases",
    "a finite phase variation rate is necessary to make sure that current _ does not _ flow between layers , as in the grounded drag configuration discussed in section  [ sec : timedepcond ] of this paper .    before comparing the present considerations to related theoretical work",
    ", we would like to point out that a substantial part of the literature on the transport anomalies of coherent quantum hall bilayers addresses tunneling@xcite and drag@xcite experiments separately .",
    "in our view , an adequate understanding of the superfluid transport anomalies can be achieved only by describing all possible transport measurements within the same framework .",
    "this point is emphasized further below .",
    "one approach that is usually applied only to tunneling experiments accounts for collective fluctuations of bosonic particle - hole pairs.@xcite these theories assume that tunneling can be treated as a weak perturbative correction to a condensate with an interlayer phase precessing at an average rate proportional to the inter - layer potential @xmath142 , _ i.e. _ @xmath143 .",
    "this picture is close to the one we employ when the tunneling current is much larger than its critical value , except that the fermionic quasiparticle degrees of freedom on which we focus do not appear explicitly .",
    "we return to this point below",
    ". a perturbative treatment of tunneling can be valid only when the system does not possess _ spontaneous _ long - range order . indeed",
    "the absence of spontaneous long range order , even at @xmath11 , appears likely in this system because of the presence of meron condensate textures that are known to be induced by potential fluctuations .",
    "a recent careful examination of a large body of experimental data by hyart and rosenow@xcite has shown that tunneling and closely related loop counterflow tunneling experiments can be accounted for by a weak - tunneling bosonic picture with phenomenological phase correlation lengths and times , presumed to be related respectively to the typical distance between merons and the time scale of their fluctuations .",
    "this picture leads to a non - linear bilayer tunneling i(v ) curve with a characteristic current scale @xmath144 proportional to the bare tunneling amplitude @xmath145 , a maximum differential conductance at zero bias that is proportional to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the phase fluctuation correlation time , and a region of sharply negative differential resistance . in comparison ,",
    "the picture which underlies the present work is one in which the characteristic current is a critical current below which the condensate is time - independent , and the differential conductance at zero bias is limited by quasiparticle scattering properties to values below around @xmath148 in the strong coherence regime and to smaller values in the weak coherence regime .",
    "we will argue below that the characteristic current scale should be the same size in both pictures",
    ". nevertheless it should be possible to distinguish the two pictures experimentally .",
    "as we have previously emphasized,@xcite we have assumed that the condensate can be time - independent if the net current carried between layers inside the active region of the coherent bilayer is sufficiently small .",
    "when the condensate is time - independent , voltage measurements reflect only elastic quasiparticle scattering rates .",
    "for example all drag transport measurements ( including drag - counterflow@xcite ) in which there is no net current flow between layers can be consistently understood in terms of the scattering properties of quasiparticles alone . for tunneling ,",
    "series counterflow,@xcite and other measurements in which there is net current - flow between layers , the condensate can be static only if the supercurrent injected into the sample by andreev quasiparticle scattering can be sunk by time - independent coherent condensate tunneling .",
    "the critical current in essence@xcite is the maximum possible value of @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the full sample area . here",
    "@xmath132 is the condensate density which is equal to @xmath151 in the absence of disorder and quantum fluctuations .",
    "it is quite clear that the experimental critical currents , if non - zero , are much smaller than the value which would be obtained using this value of @xmath132 and setting @xmath152 everywhere .",
    "it is natural to ascribe the large reduction in critical currents to the presence of the merons,@xcite which are known ( see refs .  [ ] and  [ ] and references therein ) to be induced by disorder in coherent bilayers and assumed to be present in all experimental samples . since the phase of the condensate winds by @xmath153 around a meron core , setting the spatially average value of @xmath154 , it is clear that the presence of merons will drastically influence the critical current .",
    "it seems clear that the presence of disorder in bilayers implies that long - range spontaneous phase order is not present even at @xmath11 . as first emphasized in ref .",
    "[ ] , and later detailed in ref .",
    "[ ] , the evolution of transport anomalies with in - plane fields suggests a correlation length @xmath155 , possibly related to the distance between merons , which is comparable to the spatial separation distance between the bilayer and the set - back dopant layer .",
    "long - range phase order will , however , certainly be induced in response to the non - zero inter - layer tunneling amplitude present in every sample .",
    "assuming that the degree of long - range order is determined by a balance between the coupling of the condensate to inter - layer tunneling , and the exchange fields associated with meron - induced condensate phase variation , we conclude that the effective condensate density is reduced from its uniform system value by a factor of @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the condensate stiffness . with this modification @xmath158 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isink ] ) gives as a critical current , the same characteristic interlayer current value that emerges from the perturbative condensate tunneling theory .",
    "we remark that this critical current estimate is not sensitive to the detailed meron - core configuration , so thermal or quantum fluctuations in meron positions will produce small relative fluctuations in critical current values .    in summary ,",
    "the transport anomalies of coherent quantum hall bilayers are similar to those of superconductors connected to normal metal leads , but are enriched by the possibility of contacting the two - layers separately , and by the presence of processes including transport through external conducting links , which violate separate particle - number conservation in the two layers .",
    "this paper describes a conceptual framework for describing these anomalies which combines a landauer - buttiker picture of quasiparticle transport with a description of pseudospin - pumping by time - dependent condensates .",
    "coherent bilayers are very sensitive to disorder because it tends to induce merons ( vortices ) in the order - parameter field and limit the maximum counterflow supercurrents which can be sunk by coherent interlayer tunneling .",
