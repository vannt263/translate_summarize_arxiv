    "optical phase estimation has many practical applications , such as metrology @xcite laser interferometer gravitational - wave detectors  @xcite , optical communications @xcite , quantum communications @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "generally , the precision of phase estimation is limited by the standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite . in order to enhance the precision of optical phase estimation ,",
    "two quantum - optics methods have been proposed : entangling of photons into a `` n00n '' state @xcite and phase - squeezed light @xcite . in a n00n state ,",
    "the entangled photon state is written as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the vacuum state and @xmath2 is the number state with @xmath3 photons .",
    "this can improve the statistical scaling of the error from that of the sql , @xmath4 , to that of the heisenberg limit , @xmath5 , for quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "however , since post - selection is required to create the n00n state @xcite , the measurement is probabilistic .",
    "moreover , it is technically difficult to implement the n00n state with a large photon number @xcite . the n00n state with a photon number of @xmath6 has previously been experimentally achieved by the mixing of squeezed vacuum and coherent light @xcite .",
    "however , the generation of n00n states with larger photon numbers is limited by photon losses .    the other approach , phase squeezing of light , suppresses the phase fluctuations in the coherent light to sub - sql levels at the cost of amplitude fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that quantum metrology without post - selection can be implemented by using phase - squeezed light @xcite .",
    "moreover , phase - squeezed light can be directly applied to coherent optical communications @xcite .",
    "one application is in quantum repeaters using entangled atoms prepared by entanglement generation by communication @xcite to improve both the success probability of the entanglement generation and the fidelity between an ideal atomic bell state and the generated one .",
    "another is in quantum computation using atomic entanglement generation by communication @xcite to suppress the error probability in the entanglement generation . to improve the precision with which these applications can be implemented ,",
    "it is important to generate strongly phase - squeezed light pulses with large coherent amplitudes , i.e. , the high peak power .",
    "there are several theoretical proposals for generating phase - squeezed light @xcite . as an example",
    ", the phase - squeezed state can be mathematically treated as a `` displaced '' squeezed vacuum state @xcite .",
    "when such a displacement operation can be performed on a strongly squeezed vacuum state , strongly phase - squeezed light with large coherent amplitudes may be achieved .",
    "the displacement operation is implemented by the mixing of two modes of light using a beam splitter @xcite and the noiseless amplification of a squeezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "while a squeezed vacuum with a squeezing of @xmath7 db , generated with a @xmath8 nm laser , has been observed @xcite , a large displacement operation has not been reported .",
    "this may be because photon loss degrades the squeezing effect .",
    "as another example , phase squeezing using subharmonic generation has been proposed @xcite .",
    "an early experimental example is the observation of @xmath9-db phase - squeezed light ( continuous wave ) at 1064 nm using a monolithic standing - wave lithium - niobate optical parametric amplifier with a mean photon number per sec of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 pw ) @xcite .",
    "recent experimental examples of using sub - harmonic generation include the observation of @xmath12-db phase - squeezed light ( continuous wave ) at @xmath13 nm @xcite and at @xmath8 nm @xcite using a periodically poled @xmath14 with mean photon numbers per sec of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 pw ) and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 mw ) , respectively .",
    "however , the generation of phase - squeezed light pulses with large coherent amplitudes has not yet been reported experimentally .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a scheme to perform phase squeezing on coherent light pulses with large coherent amplitudes . in our proposed scheme ,",
    "approximate phase - squeezed state is generated by the quantum interference between two slightly phase - shifted coherent states followed by post - selection of the destructive interference .",
    "the phase shift is induced by the weak cross - kerr modulation ( xpm ) with single photons . in order to verify the phase - squeezing effect , we calculated the maximum fidelity between the generated state and an arbitrary squeezed coherent state .",
    "we found that a @xmath19-db phase - squeezed state can be generated with a fidelity of @xmath20 with mean photon numbers per sec @xmath21 ( @xmath22 w ) under experimentally feasible values for inducing xpm , previously obtained in ref .",

    "in conclusion , we proposed an experimental scheme for generating phase - squeezed light pulses through the post - selection of single photons coupled with coherent light pulses via a weak cross - kerr nonlinearity . to implement the post - selection of single photons , a mach ",
    "zehnder interferometer with a variable beam splitter ( vbs ) as an output was used .",

    "zehnder interferometer interacted with coherent light via the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity , a superposition of the non - phase - shifted coherent state @xmath58 and the phase - shifted coherent state @xmath89 was generated .",
    "the post - selection of the single photon caused quantum interference between @xmath58 and @xmath89 .",

    "a few further considerations remain with regard to our proposed scheme .",
    "first , to attain a more realistic model of the experimental situation , the squeezing effect with photon losses using a beam splitter model should be considered @xcite .",
    "notably , the photon loss and the self - kerr induced anti - phase squeezing @xcite for the post - selected state would weaken the squeezing effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the photon loss for the single - photon interferometer would decrease the success rate of the post - selection .",
    "secondly , our proposal may be related to the issue of the weak - value amplification for the phase shift of coherent light through the post - selection of single photons @xcite .",
    "our estimated phases are also amplified , as shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the advantage of the weak - value amplification may be caused by the squeezing effect of the quantum state  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the relationship between quantum interference and the weak values has already been discussed @xcite . since the argument of the weak value",
    "is taken as the geometric phase , the relative phase may be characterized by the geometric phase of the single - photon interferometer .",
    "finally , our scheme may be generalized to an arbitrary quadrature squeezer , since quantum interference can be controlled by changing the relative phase .",
    "note that the effect of the phase noise is varied according to arbitrary quadrature - squeezed states .",
    "for example , the self - kerr effect enhances the squeezing amplitude for amplitude squeezed states , since anti - phase squeezing occurred .",
    "therefore , since the experimental feasibility is also varied according to the quadrature , the phase noise effect for arbitrary quadrature squeezing should be considered .",
