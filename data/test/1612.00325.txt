    "* ) of white dwarfs have been able to place constraints on the incidence of magnetism among white dwarfs .",
    "the incidence of magnetic white dwarfs in the local neighbourhood has been estimated by @xcite to be around 20% .",
    "the local sample , as well as various surveys , have shown that the incidence of magnetism as a function of field strength is constant , although @xcite suggested a possible field resurgence at the extremely low - field ( @xmath2 kg ) end of the distribution",
    ". a higher incidence of magnetism is also observed in cool polluted white dwarfs .",
    "@xcite found an incidence of @xmath3% in cool ( @xmath4 k ) daz white dwarfs . a higher incidence of magnetism was also observed among cool dz white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "a recent review on the properties of magnetic white dwarfs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the origin of large scale magnetic fields in stars is still one of the main unanswered questions in astrophysics , although recent data , particularly from surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the magnetism in massive stars ( mimes , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the binarity and magnetic interactions in various classes of stars ( binamics , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may have finally thrown some light into this matter @xcite .",
    "magnetism in white dwarfs has been explained with two main evolutionary scenarios . for a long time",
    "the leading theory was that the progenitors of magnetic white dwarfs are magnetic ap and bp stars @xcite . under the assumption of magnetic flux conservation",
    ", the magnetic field strengths observed in ap stars would correspond to magnetic fields in white dwarfs in excess of 10 mg @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of white dwarfs with weaker fields may be other main - sequence stars whose magnetic fields are below our current detection limits or could be dynamo - generated in later stages of stellar evolution .",
    "more recently , proposals that strong magnetic fields are created in evolving interacting binaries via a dynamo mechanism during a common envelope ( ce ) phase @xcite have gained momentum as a possible origin for strong magnetic fields in white dwarfs .",
    "the main reason for this proposal is that all magnetic white dwarfs appear to be either single or in interacting binaries ( the magnetic cataclysmic variables ) .",
    "that is , magnetic white dwarfs are never found paired with a non - interacting , non - degenerate star , which is at odds with the fact that approximately 30% of all non - magnetic white dwarfs are found in non - interacting binaries with a non - degenerate companion ( usually an m - dwarf ) @xcite .",
    "this result is hard to explain and leaves the magnetic cataclysmic variables without obvious progenitors . because of this observational peculiarity",
    ", the existence of magnetic fields in white dwarfs has been linked to fields generated during ce binary interactions or mergers .",
    "the merger scenario during the ce also successfully explains the higher than average mass of isolated magnetic white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the complex magnetic field structure usually observed in rotating high field magnetic white dwarfs would also be in support of a merging hypothesis .    however , a few common - proper motion ( cpm ) magnetic plus non - magnetic double degenerate systems are now known @xcite . in some of these cases ,",
    "the more massive magnetic white dwarf is hotter and hence younger than its non - magnetic companion , which seems to imply that the more massive star evolved later .",
    "this apparent paradox can be resolved by postulating that systems of this kind were initially triple systems and that the magnetic white dwarf resulted from the merger of two of the three stars ( e.g. , euvej0317@xmath5855 , * ? ? ?",
    ".    the study of the magnetic field structure in white dwarfs may also give us important clues on how they formed .",
    "normally , a simple dipole is assumed for the field structure , but the study of rotating magnetic white dwarfs have all shown variability , hence revealing much more complex structures .",
    "one of the most extreme examples of a rotating magnetic white dwarf is the hot ( @xmath6 k ) and massive ( @xmath7 ) euvej0317 - 855 , which has a rotation period of 12 minutes @xcite .",
    "the rotation of the white dwarf reveals a two component magnetic field structure : a high field magnetic spot ( @xmath8 mg ) with an underlying lower field @xcite .",
    "another example of a rotating white dwarf with a complex magnetic field structure is wd1953 - 011 @xcite . in this case , the rotation is slower ( @xmath9 days * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the magnetic field strength is much weaker ( 180 kg - 520 kg ) than that of euvej0317 - 855 .",
    "nltt12758 was discovered to be a magnetic white dwarf by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the circular polarization spectra are variable and that there is also variability in the h@xmath10 core suggesting that nltt12758 is a close double degenerate system . here , we present our analysis of spectroscopic , spectropolarimetric and photometric data of nltt12758 .",
