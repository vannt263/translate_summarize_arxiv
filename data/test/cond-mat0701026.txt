    "soon after the first experimental realization of graphene , a single - layer hexagonal form of carbon , the integral quantum hall effect ( iqhe)@xcite was observed by novoselov _ et al .",
    "_  and zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite at filling factors @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 period is understood straightforwardly as a consequence of the four - fold ( near ) degeneracy of landau levels ( lls ) in graphene ; the zeeman energy is small in comparison to the interaction energy scale , and the pseudospin degree of freedom , which represents the two inequivalent dirac - cones at the corners of the brillouin zone , does not couple to external fields if the two sublattices are equivalent .",
    "the offset @xmath4 is a consequence of a dirac - like effective hamiltonian , which produces a linear dispersion for low energy electronic states @xcite .",
    "recently , zhang _ _ et al.__@xcite have observed quantum hall plateaus at @xmath5 .",
    "although external effects can surely lift the four - fold degeneracy of the low - lying lls , yang , das sarma and macdonald@xcite have shown that the exchange interaction can break the su(4 ) symmetry spontaneously , and the charged excitations are skyrmions @xcite in the @xmath6 landau levels at @xmath7 ( or , by particle - hole symmetry , at @xmath8 ) where @xmath9 is the filling factor within the landau level in question .",
    "this has been confirmed @xcite by exact diagonalization for @xmath10 with @xmath11 particles .",
    "although the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite ( fqhe ) has not yet been observed in graphene , it has been explored theoretically @xcite assuming an su(2 ) symmetry , as appropriate , for example , when the zeeman energy is sufficiently high that only the two - fold pseudospin degeneracy remains . in this situation",
    ", the graphene fqhe problem formally maps into the well studied problem of fqhe in gaas in the zero zeeman energy limit@xcite , with the pseudospin of the former playing the role of the spin of the latter . in the @xmath12 graphene ll ,",
    "the interaction pseudopotentials@xcite are identical to those in gaas , so the mapping is perfect , and the earlier composite - fermion results of refs .",
    "carry over to graphene with minimal change ( spin replaced by pseudospin ) .",
    "in particular , it follows that fqhe occurs at fractional fillings given by @xmath13 , with pseudospin singlet states at even @xmath14 and pseudospin polarized states at odd @xmath14 ( fully pseudospin polarized for @xmath15 ) , terminating into a pseudospin singlet composite fermion fermi sea in the limit of @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the effective interaction in the @xmath18 lls in graphene interpolates between those of the @xmath19th and @xmath20st lls for the quadratic dispersion ; the composite fermion formation@xcite , and therefore the fqhe , are found to be almost as strong in the @xmath21 ll in graphene as in the lowest ll of gaas @xcite .",
    "it is natural to wonder if fqhe with _",
    "structure appears in graphene . for this purpose ,",
    "we explore in this work fqhe including the full su(4 ) symmetry . by a combination of exact diagonalization and the cf theory",
    ", we find new fqhe states which result from an essential interplay between the spin and the pseudospin degrees of freedom ; such states occur at @xmath22 for @xmath1 .",
    "for other states , the energy spectrum of the su(4 ) problem matches with that of the su(2 ) problem , although the multiplicities are vastly different .",
    "we show by exact diagonalization that the su(4 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken at @xmath23 just as at @xmath7 , i.e. , the orbital part of the ground state is antisymmetric and the excitations are skyrmionic . at @xmath24 and @xmath25 ,",
    "the orbital part of ground state is the same as in the su(2 ) symmetric system , but the state is now a highly degenerate su(4 ) multiplet .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we review the methods in sec .",
    "[ methods ] . in sec .",
    "[ newstates ] we generalize the composite fermion theory to su(4 ) electrons , using fock s condition and constructing all possible wave functions of incompressible , filled @xmath26 level states of composite fermions .",
    "we also indicate which states have analogs in gaas and which do not .",
    "section [ onethird ] is concerned with exact diagonalization results for small systems , which are compared to the predictions of the cf theory .",
    "skyrmion - like excitations are also discussed . in sec .",
    "[ thermo ] we obtain thermodynamic energies using the cf theory to determine the thermodynamic ground states .",
    "section [ phasetrans ] discusses zero - temperature phase transitions and lists the cf predictions for the parameters where the new fqhe states should be observable .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the electronic structure of graphene is well described by a tight binding model@xcite , which gives a vaulted band structure with the valence and conductance bands touching in the symmetry protected dirac ( or fermi ) points at the six corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "the low energy states , in particular , occupy double cones@xcite with apices at the corners .",
    "only two of these six double cones are inequivalent , giving rise to a pseudospin degree of freedom . denoting spin by @xmath27 and pseudospin by @xmath28 ,",
    "the low energy states are described in the continuum approximation by an effective hamiltonian@xcite @xmath29 that acts on a 4-spinor hilbert space . here",
    "@xmath30 m / s is the fermi velocity , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the on - site energy difference between the two sublattices , @xmath33 is the pseudospin operator , and @xmath27 is the spin . letting @xmath34 , measuring distance in units of the magnetic length @xmath35 , and using the symmetric gauge @xmath36 , this hamiltonian is diagonalized by the normalized eigenvectors @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the eigenstate of the hamiltonian with quadratic dispersion in ll @xmath14 with angular momentum ( @xmath41 ) equal to @xmath42 : @xmath43 the corresponding energies are @xmath44 in the limit @xmath45 , the four vectors @xmath46 are degenerate , giving rise to an su(4 ) internal symmetry .",
    "the su(4 ) approximation is valid if @xmath47 and @xmath32 are small in comparison to the scale of the interactions , @xmath48 . while @xmath32 is not easy to estimate , it is generally believed to be much smaller than @xmath49 .",
    "one can check that @xmath50},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 $ ] is the magnetic field in tesla .",
    "obviously , both @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend strongly on the interaction with environment in which the graphene sheet is placed .",
    "as two extremes , one can take @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( the graphite value ) .",
    "on the other hand , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find @xmath56 . with these extreme values , assuming an extremely high field @xmath57 t",
    ", we get @xmath58 thus the su(4 ) symmetric approximation is typically valid unless @xmath52 happens to be close to the high end of the estimation .    the interaction between eigenstates is conveniently described in terms of pseudopotentials@xcite , where the pseudopotential @xmath59 gives the energy of two electrons in relative angular momentum @xmath42 . as a consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ lllpseudo ] ) and ( [ otherpseudo ] ) , the problem of interacting electrons in the @xmath14th ll of graphene can be mapped into a problem of interacting electrons in @xmath60 states with effective pseudopotentials@xcite @xmath61 where the form factor @xmath62 is @xmath63    the problem of interacting electrons is conveniently formulated in the spherical geometry , in which electrons move on the surface of a sphere and a radial magnetic field is produced by a magnetic monopole of strength @xmath64 at the center.@xcite here @xmath65 is the magnetic flux through the surface of the sphere ; @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is an integer according to dirac s quantization condition.@xcite for quadratic dispersion the single particle states are monopole harmonics@xcite @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the angular momentum with @xmath70 being the ll index , @xmath71 is the @xmath72-component of angular momentum . the coulomb interaction is evaluated with the chord distance . the analogous solution for carriers with linear dispersion , described by the massless dirac s equation ,",
    "is not known for the spherical geometry .",
    "we proceed to work in the basis of the monopole harmonics @xmath73 of the lowest ll , while using the effective pseudopotentials given in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) . because we have @xmath74 , in the @xmath12 landau level the pseudopotentials derived by fano _ _ et al.__@xcite can be used . in other landau levels , however , we will use the effective pseudopotentials of the _ planar _ geometry ( eq .  (",
    "[ effective ] ) ) on the sphere .",
    "such an identification is obviously exact in the thermodynamic limit , but is usually reasonable also for finite systems .",
    "we neglect the finite thinkness of the two dimensional electron system , which is a much better approximation in graphene than in gaas heterostructures .",
    "the neglect of landau level mixing , also made below , is a more tricky assumption because both the ll separation ( c.f .",
    "( [ landaulevels ] ) ) and the interaction energy scale as @xmath75 , and are of the same order .",
    "however , their relative strengths can be controlled by variation of other parameters ( fermi velocity , dielectric constant , etc . ) , and we will assume in the following that the ll separation is large enough to suppress ll mixing .",
    "we will compare the exact diagonalization results to the composite fermion theory @xcite , and also use this theory to explore the thermodynamic limit .",
    "( exact diagonalization can be performed only for very small systems for su(4 ) symmetry . ) the composite fermion ( cf ) theory maps the strongly interacting system of electrons in a partially filled landau level to a system of weakly interacting particles called composite fermions , which are bound states of an electron and an even number of quantized vortices .",
    "the mapping consists of attaching @xmath76 quantized vortices of the many - body wave function to each electron .",
    "the quantized vortices produce berry phases that partly cancel the external magnetic field , and consequently composite fermions feel a reduced magnetic field @xmath77 .",
    "composite fermions in magnetic field @xmath78 fill quantized kinetic energy levels analogous to landau levels , called @xmath26 levels . if @xmath42 @xmath26 levels are filled , which corresponds to a filling factor @xmath79 , an incompressible quantum liquid state results .",
    "the fqhe is thus explained as the iqhe of composite fermions .    according to the cf theory ,",
    "the wave functions for correlated electrons in the lowest landau level at monopole strength @xmath64 are given by @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a wave function for @xmath83 non - interacting electrons at monopole strength @xmath84 , operator @xmath85 projects a state into the @xmath12 ll , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the procedure taking us from @xmath82 to @xmath88 is called  composite - fermionization , \" which also converts electronic landau levels into @xmath26 levels of composite fermions .",
    "incompressible ground states are constructed by completely filling the lowest few @xmath26 levels in one or more spin bands .",
    "the explicit relation between the monopole strength @xmath64 , the filling factor @xmath89 and the particle number @xmath83 is given below in eq .",
    "( [ mono ] ) .",
    "the above cf construction is valid for the orbital part of the wave function independent of whether the landau levels are singly , doubly , or quadruply degenerate , i.e. , whether the low - energy electronic states have no internal ( nonorbital ) symmetry , have su(2 ) symmetry , or have su(4 ) symmetry , respectively .",
    "however , while any antisymmetric wave function is valid for a singly degenerate landau level , only those wave functions are legitimate for su(2 ) which are eigenstates of @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for su(@xmath14 )",
    "electrons , the wave functions are eigenfunctions of all the casimir operators and the generators of the abelian subalgebra of the lie algebra of su(@xmath14 ) . among such functions",
    "the so - called maximal weight states@xcite satisfy fock s cyclic condition@xcite .",
    "the idea will be to construct valid iqhe wave functions @xmath82 , and then show that their  composite fermionization \" produces fqhe wave functions with valid symmetry .",
    "fock s cyclic condition tells us which orbital wave functions are legitimate for the highest weight state in the multiplet @xmath92 $ ] of su(@xmath14 ) .",
    "we are using the young tableau notation for the su(@xmath14 ) multiplets : @xmath93 are integers , @xmath94 being the length of the @xmath95-th row of the young tableau of the representation .",
    "( the last @xmath94 s are omitted if zero . )",
    "recall that young tableaux are generated from the direct products of the fundamental representation ( a single box ) with symmetrization in the rows and antisymmetrization in the columns .",
    "let @xmath96 be a basis of the ( @xmath14-dimensional ) fundamental representation of su(@xmath14 ) , and let @xmath97 be the number of particles assumed to be in the @xmath98 internal state .",
    "let @xmath99 where @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the antisymmetrizer .",
    "assume @xmath102 is antisymmetric in each subset @xmath103 of its variables .",
    "@xmath104 is a highest weight state ( w.r.t .  a choice of positive roots ) if and only if it is annihilated by any attempt to antisymmetrize an electron @xmath105 of type @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) with respect to the electrons of type @xmath108 , i.e. @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the identity and @xmath111 permutes indices @xmath112 and @xmath105 .",
    "consequently , any orbital wavefunction @xmath113 where @xmath114 s are slater determinants such that any state @xmath115 in @xmath114 is also filled in @xmath116 ( conversely , if @xmath115 is empty in @xmath114 , then it is also empty in @xmath117 ) , is a legitimate highest weight wave function for su(@xmath14 ) .",
    "this class includes iqhe states ( @xmath118 has the lowest @xmath119 landau level completely filled ; @xmath119 s are in decreasing order ) , fermi sea states , and single particle , single hole , and particle - hole pair states above the iqhe and fermi sea states , provided that no hole is created in spin state @xmath120 in a ll that is filled in @xmath117 , and , conversely , no particle is created in spin state @xmath120 in a ll that is unfilled in @xmath116 .    if state @xmath82 satisfies fock s condition ( [ condi ] ) , so does @xmath88 given by eq .

    "thus composite fermion states with parallel or antiparallel flux attachment can be constructed from electronic hartree - fock states as usual . the cf theory for su(2 )",
