    "to find the brachistochrone is one of the oldest problems in classical mechanics tracing back to newton and leibniz .",
    "it consists of finding the trajectory between two locations of a particle , subject to a gravitational field , for which the transition time becomes minimal .",
    "this problem can be generalized to a relativistic @xcite and to a quantum mechanical setting @xcite . in the latter case one",
    "seeks the minimal time @xmath2 , referred to as passage time , such that@xmath3 for given initial and final states @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "equality can be achieved by possibly tuning some parameters in the hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "bender , brody , jones and meister @xcite extended this treatment by allowing also non - hermitian hamiltonians in ( [ qb ] ) .",
    "the surprising result found in @xcite was that when involving non - hermitian , but @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians , in the evolution operator , the passage time can be made arbitrarily small by varying a parameter in @xmath6 while keeping the transition frequency between two states constant . at present",
    "this phenomenon is an observation and no explanation has been provided as to where this effect might originate from",
    ".    one might suspect that one could make the @xmath1-symmetry responsible for the observation and seek for similar arguments as those which allow to explain the reality of the spectrum of a @xmath1-symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "see for instance @xcite for recent results and reviews .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether @xmath1-symmetry can be utilized as well to explain the observed phenomenon of a tunable passage time .",
    "in fact , we find that the same conclusion can be drawn when considering non - hermitian hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues describing dissipative systems , i.e. those for which @xmath1-symmetry is definitely broken .",
    "this means the possibility of arbitrarily small passage times results from the non - hermitian nature of the hamiltonian involved in the time - evolution operator and not its @xmath1-invariance .",
    "our manuscript is organised as follows : in section ii we derive passage times for @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians for various different types of initial and final states . in section iii",
    "we perform a similar analysis for non - hermitian hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues deriving similar phenomena as in section ii .",
    "we state our conclusions in section iv .",
    "we start by considering @xmath1-symmetric or rather pseudo hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "we recall @xcite that a non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath6 is said to be a pseudo - hermitian operator , if there exists a hermitian operator @xmath7 , with regard to the standard inner product , such that @xmath8 the virtue of such a conjugate pair @xmath9 and @xmath6 is that they possess an identical eigenvalue spectrum , because the hamiltonians lie in the same similarity class .",
    "the reality of the spectrum is guaranteed , since one of the hamiltonians involved , i.e. @xmath9 , is hermitian .",
    "the solutions of the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equations @xmath10 and @xmath11 are then simply related as @xmath12 let us first discuss the quantum brachistochrone problem for these types of systems .",
    "taking the initial state @xmath17 , the final state @xmath18 to be orthonormal states of a hermitian hamiltonian system and the time - evolution operator in ( [ qb ] ) to be hermitian as well is the simplest situation to investigate .",
    "equivalent would be to investigate the non - hermitian system obtained by the similarity transformations ( [ hh ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) .",
    "here we want to solve the quantum brachistochrone problem in a slightly less stringent form as studied in @xcite . instead of solving ( [ qb ] )",
    ", we just consider the physical relevant matrix element and seek the minimal time @xmath2 , such that a given transition probability is reached .",
    "this means for normalized initial and final states we solve the equation@xmath19 for @xmath20 with given constant @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the time - evolution operators , which evolve a wavefunction from time @xmath24 to @xmath25 associated to the hermitian and non - hermitian system , respectively . in order to make the inner product involving the @xmath26s meaningful",
    ", we have to change the metric in the second expression in ( [ qb ] ) as was argued in @xcite or equivalently use a biorthonormal basis , see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "we use the convention @xmath27 for the @xmath7-inner product with @xmath28 being some operator .",
    "clearly , for given time - evolution operators and final and initial states a real solution for @xmath20 for all values of @xmath29 does not always exist .",
    "natural choices are for instance @xmath30 or the maximum transition amplitude .    starting with time independent hamiltonians ,",
    "the problem is solved in a straightforward manner as we simply have @xmath31 and @xmath32 . when @xmath33 and @xmath34 are orthogonal states we can find a solution in complete generality .",
    "taking @xmath35 and @xmath36 to be two normalized eigenstates of @xmath9 , the two states@xmath37 are orthonormal with regard to the standard inner product .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute the matrix element occurring in ( [ qb ] ) @xmath38 where the transition frequency between the two states is denoted as @xmath39 .",
    "this means the quantum brachistochrone problem in the version ( [ qb ] ) is solved for the passage time @xmath40 for @xmath30 we recover @xmath41 , which in slightly different forms , is well known and holds for any hermitian or equivalent non - hermitian system , as specified in ( [ hh ] ) . as pointed out first in @xcite",
    "more spectacular results can be obtained when involving non - hermitian hamiltonians in the evolution operator while keeping the eigenstates to be associated to a hermitian system .      in @xcite",
    "a gedankenexperiment was proposed in which a particle passes through a region , which causes its governing hamiltonian to change from a hermitian to a non - hermitian one .",
    "this scenario implies that the hamiltonian becomes explicitly time - dependent .",
    "the situation considered in @xcite was for the initial and final states to be orthogonal states in a hermitian system , whereas the time evolution was associated to a non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "in general , we can write this temporary change of the hamiltonian to a non - hermitian hamiltonian in the form@xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this means we consider an analogue to a conventional time dependent scenario , however , with the difference that the perturbation is now non - hermitian .",
    "a standard example of @xmath45 in ( [ h1 ] ) with @xmath46 being hermitian is for instance the stark - losurdo hamiltonian describing an atom in an external electric field , with @xmath9 representing the unperturbed atomic system and @xmath47 the external electric field . in @xcite",
    "the alternative scenario was considered in which also the unperturbed system was taken to be non - hermitian .",
    "the treatment in @xcite corresponds to the special case of ( [ h1 ] ) in which the time dependence is of the form of a stepfunction .",
    "this means to describe that setting one has to take @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 , with @xmath20 being the passage time rather than the pulse length as in the aforementioned example .",
    "then , depending on the choice of the initial and final states , the time - evolution operator and the inner product , the quantum brachistochrone problem can be formulated in various different ways from ( [ qb ] ) . for instance , when projecting between orthogonal hermitian states via a non - hermitian time - evolution operator one may consider @xmath52 where we used the @xmath7-norm defined as @xmath53 .",
    "this switching between the eigenstates is in fact the key point of the entire analysis .",
    "we may view equation ( [ bc2 ] ) in two equivalent ways . on one hand on the right hand side we just project with a standard hermitian time - evolution operator , between two somewhat unusual , but perfectly viable initial and final states @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "this is a picture entirely in the standard quantum mechanical description with the difference that the initial and final states are not taken to be orthogonal .",
    "on the other hand we may use the equality and view this expression as a projection of some orthogonal initial and final states by means of a non - hermitian time - evolution operator .",
    "we stress the fact that the initial and final states do not propagate in time and that the metric is not changed in this procedure @xcite .    slightly different and less natural",
    "is the possibility corresponding to ( [ qb ] ) when projecting with the standard inner product onto a final state .",
    "when written as an expectation value this amounts to @xmath56 alternatively , one may also envisage a situation when one projects from orthogonal hermitian states onto eigenstates of a non - hermitian hamiltonian via a non - hermitian time - evolution operator , or vice versa",
    ". then one should solve@xmath57 or@xmath58 as in a conventional time - dependent scenarios one is rarely able to compute the time - evolution operator exactly .",
    "however , assuming the non - hermitian term in ( [ h1 ] ) to be small when compared with @xmath9 , we may apply standard perturbation theory by iterating the duhamel formula @xcite @xmath59 taking @xmath60 we obtain to first order in @xmath61@xmath62 we may then compute for instance perturbatively the matrix element@xmath63 .\\ ] ] when @xmath46 is hermitian we naturally recover the result in ( [ a ] ) .",
    "one may now proceed perturbatively using the above expression for @xmath64 .",
    "however , it is clear from the previous discussion that essentially all aspects of the problem , which we wish to consider here , may be illustrated by selecting a two - level system from the larger , possibly even infinite , spectrum .",
    "thus without loss of generality one may consider a @xmath65 matrix hamiltonian .    in order to set the scene for",
    "the next section let us briefly recall with some minor variation the analysis of @xcite .",
    "a pair of @xmath65 matrix hamiltonians related by a similarity transformation as in ( [ hh ] ) is @xmath66{cc}% re^{i\\theta } & s\\\\ s & re^{-i\\theta}% \\end{array } \\right )   , \\text{\\quad}h=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% r\\cos\\theta & -\\frac{\\omega}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{\\omega}{2 } & r\\cos\\theta \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{h}%\\ ] ] with @xmath67 and @xmath68 . for the eigenvalues @xmath69 to be real",
    ", one requires @xmath70 , such that it is meaningful to introduce the new parameterization @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this parameter range guarantees therefore unbroken @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath6 are related by the similarity transformation in ( [ hh ] ) , involving the hermitian operator @xmath73{cc}% \\sin\\alpha/2 & -i\\cos\\alpha/2\\\\ i\\cos\\alpha/2 & \\sin\\alpha/2 \\end{array } \\right )   .",
    "\\label{eta}%\\ ] ] the normalized eigenstates of @xmath6 and @xmath9 are @xmath74{c}% -e^{\\pm\\frac{i\\alpha}{2}}\\\\ \\mp e^{\\mp\\frac{i\\alpha}{2}}% \\end{array } \\right )   , \\left\\vert \\phi_{\\pm}\\right\\rangle = \\frac{e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{4}(1\\pm1)}% } { \\sqrt{2}}\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{c}% 1\\\\ \\mp1 \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{ff}%\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "taking now as initial and final states the orthogonal states @xmath75 and @xmath76 as defined in ( [ fi ] ) , we compute @xmath77 and recover from ( [ qb ] ) , with @xmath30 , the passage time @xmath78 .",
    "this is what we expect from the general expression ( [ tb ] ) and in fact it is the same expression as obtained in @xcite , where essentially the second equation in ( [ qb ] ) was evaluated .",
    "on the other hand , if we now let the particle pass through the region in which the corresponding hamiltonian becomes non - hermitian , we may compute @xmath20 by analyzing ( [ bc2 ] ) or possibly ( [ bc ] ) . acting with @xmath79 on the transformed initial state",
    "yields@xmath80 when not acting on eigenstates with the operator @xmath81 or @xmath82 one has to turn the infinite sum of operators into a matrix multiplication , see e.g. @xcite . for",
    "this one can exploit the fact that any @xmath83-matrix @xmath84 can be decomposed in terms of pauli matrices as @xmath85 with @xmath86 , @xmath87 having expressed @xmath9 or @xmath6 in this manner , the operation with @xmath81 or @xmath82 on a state reduces to a simple matrix multiplication by using the identity @xmath88 .    using ( [ 2 ] ) , the matrix element in ( [ bc2 ] ) is computed to @xmath89 choosing the constant @xmath30 and substituting ( [ xx ] ) into ( [ bc2 ] ) , we compute with @xmath90 the passage time @xmath91 .",
    "this expression involves now the parameter @xmath92 , which may be tuned to make @xmath20 arbitrarily small while keeping the transition frequency constant , as was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "there are two equivalent ways of looking this result .",
    "on one hand we may think that one has solved the quantum brachistochrone problem entirely within the framework of the hermitian system for some states , which have no obvious intrinsic meaning without referring to the non - hermitian counterpart .",
    "on the other hand we may think that one has solved the time - dependent problem as outlined in the previous subsection involving the evolution with a non - hermitian hamiltonian between two orthonomal states in the hermitian system .",
    "similarly , we may consider a situation in which the final state is constructed from eigenstates of the non - hermitian system and compute instead@xmath93 this yields for the same choice of @xmath30 the passage time @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "we summarize our findings for the different types of scenarios in the following table :    [ c]||l|l|l|l||@xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath96 & @xmath20 + @xmath97 & @xmath98 & @xmath99 & @xmath100 + @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath99 & @xmath101 + @xmath75 & @xmath98 & @xmath99 & @xmath102 + @xmath97 & @xmath76 & @xmath99 & @xmath102 +    @xmath103-symmetric non - hermitian time evolution operator .",
    "all matrix elements are computed with the @xmath104-inner product and states are normalized with the @xmath7-norm .",
    "next we demonstrate that such type of behaviour is not limited to @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonians , but can also be found for dissipative systems , i.e. genuinely non - hermitian hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues with negative imaginary part .",
    "as argued above it is sufficient to consider a @xmath65 matrix hamiltonian .",
    "we will now consider two different types of dissipative systems , i.e. those which have real and those with complex transition frequencies .",
    "let us modify the hamiltonian @xmath6 in ( [ h ] ) slightly , such that it becomes a genuinely dissipative system . in order to achieve this",
    "we need to break the @xmath1-symmetry not only for the wavefunction , but also for the hamiltonian .",
    "such type of  hamiltonians result for instance as effective hamiltonians by coupling two non - degenerate states to some open channel as for instance explained in @xcite .",
    "we consider here such type of hamiltonian of the particular form @xmath105{cc}% e+\\varepsilon & 0\\\\ 0 & e-\\varepsilon \\end{array } \\right )   -i\\lambda\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% re^{i\\theta } & s\\\\ s & re^{-i\\theta}% \\end{array } \\right )   , ~~ \\label{h2}%\\ ] ] with @xmath106 .",
    "similarly as for ( [ h ] ) we will not provide here a concrete physical meaning for the parameters , as we would like to keep our treatment as generic as possible . note that this hamiltonian does not simply correspond to going to the regime of broken @xmath1-symmetry for the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) of the previous section .",
    "instead , in the simultaneous limit @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the dissipative hamiltonian system @xmath109 reduces to the @xmath1-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath109 are computed to@xmath110 with @xmath111 denoting the transition frequency . for @xmath112",
    "being restricted to the interval @xmath113 , we can guarantee that @xmath114 . in this parameter range the complex energy eigenvalues are indeed of the desired form of a decaying state , that is @xmath115 with decay width @xmath116 when @xmath117 .",
    "it is then useful to introduce the parameterization@xmath118 such that @xmath119 .",
    "the right eigenvectors of @xmath109 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath120 in ( [ et ] ) may then be expressed as @xmath121 where @xmath122 is defined in equation ( [ ff ] ) . from the considerations in the previous section",
    "it is clear that the operator @xmath7 is vital for the computations of the matrix elements occurring in the quantum brachistochrone problem , especially when one wishes to evolve eigenstates of a hermitian hamiltonian with a time - evolution operator associated to a non - hermitian system .",
    "however , since for the case at hand the hamiltonian @xmath109 is now genuinely complex there can not exist any similarity transformation , which relates it to a hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "nonetheless , we can use the other property of @xmath7 , namely that it can be utilized to introduce a physically well defined inner product .",
    "this means we can seek a transformation such that the eigenstates ( [ ev ] ) become orthonormal with regard to this product . from ( [ ev ] )",
    "it is clear that we can take the same form for @xmath7 , but only have to replace @xmath92 by @xmath123 to define a new @xmath124 . with the help of this new operator",
    "we construct the eigenstates @xmath125 , which yield indeed the desired orthogonality relations @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "the states @xmath128 are eigenstates to the analogue of the hermitian counterpart of a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the adjoint action of @xmath124 diagonalizes @xmath109 as @xmath129{cc}% e - i\\frac{\\gamma}{2}-\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}}{2 } & 0\\\\ 0 & e - i\\frac{\\gamma}{2}+\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}}{2}% \\end{array } \\right )   .\\ ] ] obviously we have now @xmath130 , but @xmath131 has the same eigenvalues as @xmath109 , because it lies in the same similarity class .",
    "we are now in the position to solve the quantum brachistochrone problem for dissipative non - hermitian hamiltonians . for this",
    "we note first that when we try to compute the passage time @xmath20 directly from the relation ( [ qb ] ) with @xmath30 , it will turn out to be complex",
    ". this would of course always be the case when the transition amplitude for all real values of @xmath25 is smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "therefore in order to find a physical solution we need to reformulate the quantum brachistochrone problem slightly to accommodate also the dissipative non - hermitian hamiltonians . a natural expression to consider is one which features explicitly the decay width @xmath133 , such as @xmath134 for normalized initial and final states with @xmath135 .",
    "this means for stable particles , i.e. @xmath136 , we recover the expression ( [ qb ] ) . in analogy to the normalized eigenstates of the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath9 in ( [ fi ] ) , we take now the initial and final states to be @xmath137 assuming at first no time dependence in the hamiltonian , we compute @xmath138 solving then ( [ qbnh ] ) for the passage time in complete analogy to ( [ qb ] ) with @xmath139 yields the same expression for the passage time , namely @xmath140 .",
    "alternatively we could have also computed the second expression in ( [ qbnh ] ) using @xmath141 , which would of course lead to the same result .",
    "possibly more interesting passage times can be obtained when we evolve the states ( [ 28 ] ) with the analogue to the non - hermitian time evolution .",
    "we may assume now an explicit time dependence as in section ii c and try to evolve the states @xmath142 by means of a time - evolution operator involving the hamiltonians @xmath109 in ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "for that situation to make sense we need to consider the @xmath124-inner products and generalize ( [ bc2 ] ) to @xmath143 by introducing the decay width on the right hand side , similarly as we extended ( [ qb ] ) to ( [ qbnh ] ) . this way the passage time will result to be real . assuming a simple stepfunction time - dependence in ( [ h1 ] ) , we compute @xmath144 and the matrix element @xmath145 since @xmath146 in ( [ gh ] )",
    ", we obtain with @xmath139 the passage time @xmath147 .",
    "likewise we may evaluate analogues to the other matrix elements computed in section ii c. our results are summarized in table 2    [ c]||l|l|l|l||@xmath17 & @xmath18 & @xmath148 & @xmath20 + @xmath149 & @xmath150 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 + @xmath153 & @xmath154 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 + @xmath153 & @xmath150 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 + @xmath149 & @xmath154 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 +    thus somewhat surprisingly , despite the fact the matrix elements are somwhat different , the normalization factors compensate for this and in all cases the passage time results to @xmath147 .",
    "this might suggest that we should really attribute the possibility of tunable passage times to the @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "however , we have not yet studied the possibility when @xmath155 .",

    "we may now compute the passage time in a very similar fashion as for the @xmath1-symmetric example , keeping however in mind that the transition frequency @xmath169 as well as the parameter @xmath165 are complex .",
    "a consequence of the latter is that @xmath166 is no longer hermitian , that is @xmath170 . for convenience",
    "we introduce the abbreviations @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 for @xmath174      it is straightforward to compute the square of the transition probability@xmath176   , \\label{tt}%\\ ] ] when taking the initial and final states to be the orthonormal states as defined in ( [ fi ] ) , with @xmath177 there are now various possibilities we can equate this to and subsequently compute a passage time @xmath20 .",
    "however , choosing a generic @xmath21 as for instance in equation ( [ qb ] ) would lead to very involved solutions , due to the transcendental nature of this equation .",

    "instead we try to make this solution to be as closely related to previously computed expressions as possible and choose the right hand side such that the passage time becomes @xmath181 leading to a particular @xmath182 .",
    "we note that this choice does not lead to a loss of generality with regard to the main aim of our investigation , which is to seek passage times which can be made arbitrarily small . taking any other value below the maximum",
    "will simply lead to another definite value for @xmath20 , when keeping @xmath169 constant .      as in all previous scenarios",
    "we take the special case @xmath183 via  as a benchmark for the choice of the constant @xmath184 , since it can be dealt with analytically .",
    "let us now compute@xmath185 with @xmath186 and the choice of @xmath184 as discussed in the previous section , namely taking it to be the right hand side of ( [ tt ] ) with @xmath187 , the quantum brachistochrone problem amounts to solving @xmath188 in this case .",
    "since this is a transcendental equation , we can not solve it in complete generality and we are therefore content to discuss some numerical solutions .",
