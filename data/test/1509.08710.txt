    "the current picture describing launching and acceleration processes of relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) attributes a key role to magnetic fields , by means of which the energy stored in a rapidly spinning ( kerr ) supermassive black hole ( bh ) can be extracted and channeled into a poynting flux ( blandford & znajek 1977 , tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) .",
    "the jet power , originally carried by an almost pure electromagnetic beam ( with magnetization parameter @xmath2 ) , is progressively used to accelerate matter , until a substantial equipartition between the magnetic and the kinetic energy fluxes ( @xmath3 ) is established ( e.g. , komissarov et al .",

    "dissipation of part of the kinetic ( through shocks ) and/or magnetic ( through reconnection ) power leads to the acceleration of particles up to ultra ",
    "relativistic energies , producing the non  thermal emission we observe from the jets of _ blazars _ , i.e. radio  loud agn with a jet closely pointing toward the earth ( urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "this consistent paradigm has recently received strong support by extensive general relativistic mhd simulations ( e.g. tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2009 , 2011 ) , proving that the power actually extracted from the bh  accretion disk system is larger than the sole accreting power @xmath4 , as indeed expected if the system can access the bh rotation energy , i.e. if the blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) mechanism is at work .",
    "observationally , this result is supported by studies comparing the jet and the accretion power , which show that the jet indeed carries a power larger than that associated to the accreted matter , estimated through the disk radiation ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 , 2014 ) .",
    "simulations demonstrate that a key role in determining such an efficient energy extraction is played by dynamically important magnetic fields built up in the inner regions of the accretion flow .",
    "in fact , the magnetic flux close to the bh horizon is so large that accretion likely occurs through a magnetically arrested accretion ( mad ) flow ( narayan et al .",
    "2003 , tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "2011 , mckinney et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "an important point of the scheme sketched above is that  absent substantial dissipation  the magnetic energy flux of the jet at large scale should still represent a large fraction ( @xmath5 ) of the total jet power . ideally the magnetic flux carried by the jet should be comparable to that supported by inner accretion disk and regulating the energy extraction from the bh . from the observational point of view , the situation is however not clear .",
    "zamaninasab et al . (",
    "2014 ) showed that the jet magnetic flux at parsec scale  derived through the observed frequency - dependent core ",
    "shift in the radio band ( lobanov et al . 1998 )  correlates with the power of the corresponding accretion flow and has an absolute value comparable to that predicted by a mad .",
    "an alternative and reliable way to estimate the magnetic fields associated to the emitting regions of the innermost ( @xmath6 pc ) part of jets is through the modeling of the relativistically beamed non  thermal continuum of blazars ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1998 , 2010 , tavecchio et al . 1998 , 2010 ) .",
    "nalewajko , sikora & begelman ( 2014 ) noted that the large magnetic field flux derived through the core ",
    "shift effects by zamaninasab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) seems to exceed the values suggested by the typical blazar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . the great majority of the sources of the sample used by zamaninasab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) are flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , in which the high  energy bump of the sed , thought to derive from the inverse compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the jet , largely dominates over the low energy synchrotron bump , thus pointing to relatively small magnetic fields ( though this fact does not directly implies * sub - equipartition * magnetic fields , since the ratio of the ic and synchrotron luminosity  related to the ratio of the radiation and magnetic energy densities  does not directly involve the electron energy density ) .",
    "another line of research supporting the important role of magnetic fields in jets is that related to particle acceleration .",
    "indeed , it is becoming clear that the widely assumed diffusive shock acceleration process ( e.g. heavens & drury 1988 ) is quite inefficient in accelerating highly relativistic particles with energies far above the thermal one ( e.g. sironi et al .",
    "a much more promising mechanism is the dissipation of magnetic energy through reconnection ( e.g. giannios et al .",
    "2009 , uzdensky 2011 , cerutti et al .",
    "a prediction of this scenario , resulting from detailed particle  in  cell simulations , is the substantial equipartition between the field and the accelerated electrons downstream of the reconnection site , where particles cool and emit the radiation we observe ( sironi et al .",
    "modelling of fsrq seds is in agreement with this prediction ( e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "2010 ; ghisellini & tavecchio 2015 ) .",
    "needless to say , the magnetic reconnection scenario requires that jets carry a sizeable fraction of their power in the magnetic form up to the emission regions .",
    "as noted above , most of the sources in which the role of magnetic field has been investigated are fsrqs .",
    "powerful fsrqs are indeed the majority of the sources belonging to the sample used by zamaninasab et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , as well as the sources for which equipartition between relativistic electrons and magnetic field is well established through the sed modelling . by definition , these sources are characterized by the presence of an efficient accretion flow around the central bh , flagged by the presence of luminous broad emission lines in the optical spectra or even by the detection of the direct emission bump from the accretion disk ( e.g. ghisellini & tavecchio 2015 ) . in view of the recent insights and problems discussed above",
    "it is interesting to extend the investigation to bl lac objects .",
    "upper limits to the thermal components support the view that the accretion rate in these sources is quite low and the accretion flow is likely in the inefficient regime characterizing the advection dominated accretion flows ( e.g. , ghisellini et al . 2009 ) . in principle , the jet formation and its structure could be different to that of fsrq with powerful and radiatively efficient accretion .",
    "moreover , the absence of an important environmental radiation field around the jet implies that the high  energy bump in the sed of bl lac is dominated by the inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photon themselves ( synchrotron self compton model , ssc ) . as demonstrated by tavecchio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in this case the relevant physical parameters ( most notably for our purposes the magnetic field and the electron density ) can be uniquely and robustly derived once the sed is relatively well sampled .    in tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2010 ) the ssc model was applied to all the bl lac detected in the @xmath1ray band ( by cherenkov telescopes or by _ fermi_-lat in the first three months of operation ) and the parameters for all sources were derived .",
    "here we exploit this large sample to derive the magnetic and the particle energy density of bl lac objects (  2 ) .",
    "we anticipate that the magnetic energy density we will derive adopting the popular one  zone scenario is quite small compared to that associated to the non - thermal emitting electrons , in conflict with the expectations . in ",
    "3 we review some possible solutions of this problem and we discuss our results in  4 .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the following cosmological parameters are assumed : @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath11 in cgs units .",
    "the application of simple emission models allows us to derive the basic physical parameters of the emission region from the observed sed .",
    "specifically , we will apply the one ",
    "zone synchrotron ",
    "self compton ( ssc ) model ( e.g. tavecchio et al . 1998 ) , from which we can derive the source size @xmath12 , the doppler factor @xmath13 , the jet comoving frame ( primed symbols ) magnetic field @xmath14 and the ( jet frame ) parameters describing the broken power law electron energy distribution @xmath15 : the minimum , the break and the maximum lorentz factors @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the two slopes @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the normalization , @xmath21 .",
    "the assumed phenomenological form of the electron energy distribution is generally valid to reproduce the typical blazar sed bumps , approximately characterized by two power laws with slopes @xmath22 and @xmath23 , connected at the peak frequency .    from these parameters one can directly derive the jet comoving energy density in magnetic field , @xmath24 , and in relativistic electrons : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total ( integrated ) electron numerical density and the last expression is valid for @xmath27 .",
    "the corresponding contributions to the jet power ( assuming that the emission region encompasses the entire jet cross section ) @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( e.g. celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) : @xmath30 where the bulk lorentz factor @xmath31 and : @xmath32 in the usual case with @xmath33 and neglecting the high - energy part of the electron energy distribution , the average lorentz factor is @xmath34 . note that , since the average lorentz factor is typically large , @xmath35 , the power carried by the electron component is often comparable to that associated by a possible component of cold protons . due to this reason and the uncertainty on the jet composition , we do not include protons in the following and we just consider @xmath29 , noting that this is a _ strict lower limit _ for the power carried by the particle component .",
    "note also that the ratio between the magnetic and the electron jet luminosities is just the ratio between the corresponding comoving energy densities , @xmath36 .      along the lines of the analytical treatment in tavecchio",
    "( 1998 ) for the one zone ssc model it is possible to derive a useful approximate analytical expression for the ratio @xmath37 as a function of the observed sed quantities .",
    "we specialize the following treatment to the case  usually valid for high - energy emitting bl lac  in which the ssc peak is produced by scatterings occurring in the klein - nishina limit ( in any case the detailed numerical model include the full treatment of the ic kinematics and cross section ) .",
    "the magnetic energy density can be evaluated using the synchrotron and the ssc peak frequencies , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "in fact , in the kn regime , the observed ssc peak frequency @xmath39 is related to the energy of the electrons at the break @xmath40 by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a function of the spectral slopes before and after the peak ( see appendix ) .",

    "this is clearly a consequence of the fact that , as stressed in tavecchio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the parameters specifying the one - zone ssc model are uniquely determined once the basic observables ( i.e. the synchrotron and the ssc peak frequencies and luminosities plus the variability timescale ) are known . in the previous derivation",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     0.4 true cm      before presenting the results for the entire sample , it is worth to discuss a specific case , showing how the sed fitting method allows one to obtain quite robust estimates of the physical quantities . to this purpose",
    "we focus our attention on mkn 421 , one of the bl lac detected at tev energies characterized by the most complete sed coverage .",
    "in particular , abdo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) presented a sed with a nicely complete sampling from radio up to tev @xmath1rays obtained during an intensive multifrequency campaign .",
    "the source was in a relatively quiescent state , thus representing a sort of average activity state of the jet .",
    "the sed , with two possible realizations of the ssc model , is reported in fig . [ 421 ] .",
    "as already stressed , the one - zone ssc model parameters are uniquely specified once the sed bumps ( namely , peak frequencies and luminosities ) and the variability timescale are well characterized ( tavecchio et al .",
    "the latter observable determines the value of the source size , through the causality relation @xmath76 .",
    "the values of the peak frequencies and luminosities can be linked to the other physical parameters , most notably the magnetic field and the particle density and energy .",
    "the available data ( fig . [ 421 ] ) provide an excellent description of both the synchrotron and the ic peak .",
    "less constrained is the variability timescale . indeed",
    "the time coverage of the source during the campaign was not suited to probe short variability and it only allows abdo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to follow daily  scale variations .",
    "activity at shorter ( even to sub ",
    "hour , e.g. alekisc et al .",
    "2011 ) timescale can not however be excluded .",
    "for this reason we performed two fits of the sed , with @xmath77 h and 24 h. the parameters used to reproduce the sed ( with the model described in maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ) , together with the energy densities and the jet powers derived using eq .",
    "[ pb][pe ] , are reported in table 1 .    in the model ,",
    "the electron energy distribution is phenomenologically assumed to follow a broken power law shape , with the break at the energy @xmath78 .",
    "we remark that the distribution is fixed only by the condition to reproduce the observed sed , without taking self - consistently into account the evolution due to injection and cooling effects ( e.g. kirk et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "as expected after the discussion above , it is clear that , although some of the parameters are different in the two cases ( in particular the source radius ) , the ratio between the energy densities is relatively stable , implying that the energy density ( and the power ) associated to the non  thermal electrons is largely ( by a factor 2050 ) dominant over that of the magnetic field ( see the similar conclusion in abdo et al .",
    "2011 for the same dataset ) .",
    "the largest ratio is obtained for the case of the shorter ( and more usual ) variability timescale .",
    "this result is rather general : the shorter the variability timescale the smaller the derived magnetic field ( see also aleksic et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "the reason for the small magnetic field ( and relatively large doppler factor ) required by the ssc modeling of tev emitting sources can be traced back to the large separation between the two sed peaks .",
    "indeed , to produce the high  energy peak at @xmath79 hz the break energy of the electron distribution should be at least of @xmath80 .",
    "since the synchrotron bump peaks around the soft x - ray band , @xmath81 hz , we directly derive a typical magnetic field of @xmath82 . a limited possibility to reduce",
    "the @xmath83 ratio is by decreasing the number of radiating electrons , increasing the minimum lorentz factor , @xmath16 .",
    "an upper limit to @xmath16 is however provided by the condition to reproduce the optical and the _ fermi_lat data , tracking the low  energy part of the synchrotron and ic bump , respectively .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "1 , for which @xmath16 for model 2 has been increased to @xmath84 ( dashed orange line ) . even in this extreme case",
    "the electron energy density decreased only slightly , from @xmath85 erg @xmath51 to @xmath86 erg @xmath51 .    in passing",
    ", we also note that the cooling time of the electrons at the break ( i.e. those emitting at the peak ) is comparable with the dynamical timescale @xmath87 , consistently with the idea that the break in the electron energy distribution is related to radiative losses .",
    "this example confirms that the estimate of the magnetic and kinetic ( electronic ) energy density ( and the associated powers ) in the framework of the one  zone model is quite robust and reliable .",
    "tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2010 ) obtained the physical parameters associated to 45 bl lacs applying the one  zone synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) model ( e.g. tavecchio et al . 1998 ) to non - simultaneous sed , whose ic peak is tracked by either _",

    "[ magndens ] . as already discussed for the case of mkn 421 , most of the sources are characterized by an electron component strongly dominating over the magnetic one , with an average ratio @xmath88 . as discussed above ,",
    "the uncertainty affecting both @xmath53 and @xmath89 is limited , and can not account for a systematic error of such a large ratio . in fig .",
    "[ magn ] we also report the comparison between the corresponding powers . again , the magnetic power is largely below that associated to the relativistic electrons in most of the sources .",
    "the non  simultaneity of several sed and the quality of the data that is not always optimal impacts on the derived parameters for single objects , but this is compensated by the large number of sources ensuring that , from the statistical point of view , the estimates can be trusted .",
    "we also note that the small value of the magnetic energy density characterizing the bl lacs of our sample  related to the level of the synchrotron ( and ssc ) emission  has an impact on the radiative efficiency of the jets . in fig .",
    "[ effic ] we report the value of the ratio between the dynamical timescale @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the cooling time of the electrons with lorentz factor @xmath17  i.e. those emitting at the sed peak  as a function of the jet power carried by the relativistic electrons , @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , the majority of the sources lies in the region with @xmath92 , implying a small radiative efficiency for most these jets ( note that for mkn 421 we obtained @xmath93 ) . the low efficiency is clearly related to the small magnetic field .",
    "we can conclude that the simple one - zone leptonic model for bl lacs foresees quite inefficient jets , implying large jet powers .",
    "note also that , since the cooling time for the electrons emitting at the synchrotron peak is smaller than the typical jet dynamical timescale , the break in the electron energy distribution required to reproduce the sed shape can not be related to the radiative losses of the electrons ( as for the case of fsrq , e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "in fact a possible cooling break should appear at much larger frequencies  for which the relations @xmath94 holds for the electrons with lorentz factor @xmath1 , i.e. in the hard x - ray band , which is not well sampled by currents observations .",
    "the results of the preceding section show that in the framework of the one  zone ssc model for bl lac jets , the energy density associated to the relativistic electron component largely exceeds that of the magnetic field . given the striking difference with the case of fsrq and the conflict with expectations from the theoretical scenario , it is compelling to investigate whether this conclusion can be revised using a different setup of the emission model .",
    "needless to say , the most direct possibility is to relax the strong assumption that the emission involves only one homogeneous region .",
    "this line is supported by growing evidence that the emission sites could indeed be more complex than what is usually depicted in the simple one  zone scheme . in the following we discuss two possible alternative scenarios that  at a first sight  could provide a solution to the problem .      as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "there is growing evidence that processes triggered by magnetic reconnection events could provide an effective way to account for particle acceleration in relativistic outflows .",
    "support to the idea that emission in blazars can be associated to reconnection sites comes from independent arguments based i ) on the observed ultra  fast variability ( e.g. giannios et al . 2009 , giannios 2013 , nalewajko et al . 2011 ) and ii ) on the inefficient acceleration provided by shocks ( sironi et al .",
    "2015 ) . in this context one",
    "thus expects that the emission from blazars ( or at least a part of it ) is produced by magnetic reconnection in compact regions .",
    "however , as discussed above , assuming that the entire emission is produced by compact regions does not solve the problem posed by our results , since , as long as the synchrotron and the ic ( ssc ) emission are produced by the same region(s ) , the magnetic  to  electron energy density ratio is uniquely fixed by the sed at the values derived in  2 .",
    "a possibility is to decouple the emission , assuming that the compact regions are responsible for the ( energetic and rapidly variable ) high  energy component , while the low  energy radiation is produced by electrons living in a larger volume of the jet .",
    "this scheme would mimic scenarios in which the emission zone comprises one ( or more ) reconnection island , in rough equipartition , and a larger , magnetically dominated region  the jet ",

    "[ reconn ]  can be explained as follows .",
    "let us start with a relatively large compact region , so that the radiation energy density of the jet ( as measured in the frame of the compact region ) is larger than that produced by the compact region itself , @xmath116 ( see eq .",
    "[ uradblob ] ) . in this case , since the radiation energy density is fixed , to produce a fixed ic luminosity , the system requires a fixed number of electrons .",
    "furthermore , since the synchrotron luminosity that the system has to produce is also fixed , also the magnetic energy density is fixed .",
    "considering now a smaller radius of the source ( but large enough so that the jet radiation energy density still dominates ) , the only quantity that changes is the electron density , since the same amount of electrons is confined in a smaller volume .",
    "this directly implies that the ratio @xmath114 decreases with decreasing @xmath115 . for @xmath115",
    "small enough , instead , the local energy density dominates . in this regime , decreasing @xmath115 implies the increase of the soft photon energy density ( since the constant synchrotron luminosity is produced in a more compact region ) , leading to the reduction of the number of electrons ( and thus of the electron energy density ) . to keep the synchrotron luminosity constant",
    ", the magnetic energy density has to increase .",
    "the combination of these two effects leads to increase @xmath114 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath117 is therefore located to the radius where @xmath118    fig.[uradblob ] clearly shows that in all cases the system is still strongly unbalanced toward the electron component .",
    "we conclude that even in this framework one can not reproduce the equipartition conditions .      a second possibility that could alleviate the problem is to partly decouple the synchrotron and ic components , assuming the existence of a supplementary source of soft photons intervening in the ic emission .",
    "note indeed that , according to eq .",
    "[ lratio ] , for a constant ratio of ic and synchrotron luminosities , a larger radiation energy density  implying a reduced number of emitting electrons  allows a larger magnetic field energy density ( for a constant synchrotron output ) .",
    "such a scheme is naturally implemented in the so  called structured ( or spine  layer ) jet scenario ( ghisellini , tavecchio & chiaberge 2005 ) , inspired by peculiar features of tev emitting bl lacs , such as the absence of fast superluminal components , the presence of a edge  brightened radio structure and the issues related to the unification with radiogalaxies . in this model",
    "one assumes the existence of two regions in the jet : a faster inner core ( the spine ) , surrounded by a slower sheath of material ( the layer ) .",
    "given the amplification of the radiation emitted by one region as observed in the frame of the other caused by the relative motion , the ic luminosity of both components ( in particular that of the spine ) is increased with respect to that of the one  zone model .",
    "the emission from blazars is dominated by the spine , and the less beamed layer emission is thought to be visible only for misaligned jets ( e.g. sbarrato et al .",
    "2014 ) .    to investigate the possibility to increase the magnetic  to  electron energy density in this framework , it is useful to derive some simple analytical relations that can help us to fix ideas .",

    "in particular the strong dependence on @xmath12 and @xmath13 suggests that with a relatively large value of the doppler factor the model can achieve equipartition .",
    "note that in the previous arguments we did not discuss the characteristics of the layer emission , which is thought to be able to provide the required level of soft radiation .",
    "the only strong constraints that can be put is that the level of the synchrotron component of the layer , as observed at earth , is much less than the spine synchrotron emission .    in fig .",

    "as suggested above , this can be achieved with a relatively large doppler factor , @xmath121 .",
    "we remark again that , as long as the scattering between the spine electrons and the layer seed photons occurs in the kn regime , only the luminosity of the layer soft emission is important , while the details of its spectrum do not affect the spine high energy emission .",
    "we conclude that the structured jet model can satisfactorily reproduce the sed in equipartition conditions with a reasonable choice of the parameters .",
    "the current general scenario for jet production assumes that jet starts as a strongly magnetized flow and remains highly magnetized up to large distances .",
    "a highly magnetized plasma is also required by magnetic reconnection models , according to which the non  thermal particle population is energized at the magnetic reconnection sites .",
    "recent particle - in - cells simulations ( sironi et al . 2014 ) further show that the post ",
    "reconnection downstream regions should be characterized by a substantial equipartition between particles and magnetic fields .",
    "bl lac objects represent the best systems to investigate the role of magnetic field . in standard one  zone models",
    "all parameters are fixed by current observations of the bl lac sed and the jet comoving energy densities are robustly determined .",
    "we have shown that in this framework the magnetic energy densities comes out to be 12 order of magnitude smaller that that associated to relativistic electrons . occasionally , some works in the past reported the same conclusion on single sources ( e.g. abdo et al . 2009 , acciari et al .",
    "2011 , aleksic et al .",
    "2012 , 2015 ) , but we have demonstrated that this is a common property of the large majority of bl lacs , stemming from the typical sed parameters .    we have shown that a viable possibility to reconcile the observations with the theoretical scenario is to relax the assumption that the emission involves only one region . in the structured jet model ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2015 ) , in which the seed photons for the emission from the spine are mainly provided by the surrounding slow layer , it is indeed possible to reproduce the observed sed assuming equipartition between the magnetic and the electron energy densities .",
    "we recall here that the existence of the postulated structure in bl lac jets ( and fri radiogalaxies ) is supported by a variety of observational and phenomenological arguments ( e.g. chiaberge et al .",

    "2004 , piner & edwards 2014 , nagai et al . 2014 ) and also by numerical simulations ( e.g. rossi et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we have also suggested that structured bl lac jets could provide the ideal environment to produce the pev neutrinos detected by icecube ( tavecchio et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "another  though less attractive  possibility would be to assume that the emission involves only a single region of the jet ( and thus would be satisfactorily described by one  zone models ) but the inferred magnetic fields are not representative of the actual fields carried by the jet . to satisfy the ( conservative ) conditions @xmath122 ( and @xmath123 ) one requires magnetic energy densities larger by a factor 10100 than those derived by the sed modeling with one  zone models . a somewhat _ ad hoc _ possibility ( see also nalewajko et al . 2014 )",
    "is to assume that while the observed emission is produced in a matter dominated core of the outflow ( the _ spine _ ) , there is a magnetically dominated layer whose associated magnetic luminosity satisfy the above requirements .",
    "along the same lines one could argue that the emission is limited to localized compact sites embedded in a much magnetized plasma .",
