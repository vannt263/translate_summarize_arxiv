    "one of the most important problems of the modern cosmology is the determination of the density and spatial distribution of the baryonic fraction of the matter .",
    "there are several sources of information about @xmath0 parameter , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the present values of the baryonic and critical densities and @xmath3 is the hubble constant normalized to 100 @xmath4 .",
    "firstly , the baryonic fraction of the matter manifests itself in the well known mass -luminosity relation for galaxies and cluster of galaxies which leads to the following value of the @xmath5 parameter : @xmath6 ( see for the review by freedman et al .",
    "another one comes from the confrontation of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) theory and observational data ( see for the review by fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "the corresponding value of the baryonic density from this method is @xmath7 an additional empirical relation between baryonic and dark matter fractions @xmath8 at @xmath9 comes from x - ray data on clusters of galaxies ( carlberg et al . 1996 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ) . for the most popular @xmath10cdm cosmological model with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the corresponding value of the @xmath5 parameter is @xmath13 in agreement with the sbbn predictions .",
    "an independent important information about the baryonic fraction of the matter in the universe comes from the recent cmb experiments such as boomerang ( de bernardis et al .",
    "2000 ) and maxima-1 ( hanany et al . 2000 ) . fitting the cmb anisotropy power spectrum to the above mentioned observational data ( tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ; white et al .",
    "2000 and lesgourgues & peloso 2000 ) indicates that a baryon fraction parameter should be significantly larger than the sbbn expected value , namely , @xmath14 .",
    "however , recently bond & critteden ( 2001 ) show that new boomerang , maxima-1 and dasi data do not contradict to @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth noting that the above mentioned methods of the baryonic fraction density estimation from the cmb and sbbn predictions are based on the simple idea that the distribution of matter ( including dark matter particles and baryons ) is practically homogeneous for all scales , except some fluctuations leading to the galaxy and large - scale structure formation .",
    "typically , they are assumed to be adiabatic one .",
    "one can ask , how sensitive are the cmb data themselves to the presence of the small scale baryonic ( non - linear ) clouds before cosmological recombination and how can they transform the standard schemes of the cosmological parameter extraction from the cmb data ? definitely , this possibility is related to the isocurvature perturbations of the composite fluid which contains baryons , cdm particles , photons and neutrinos at very high redshift @xmath16 .",
    "there are a lot of modes of perturbations in the composite fluid , which is discussed by riazuelo & langlos ( 2000 ) , bartolo , matarrese & rioto ( 2001 ) , polarski & starobinsky ( 1994 ) , abramo & finelli ( 2001 ) , bucher , moodley & turok ( 2000 ) and others .",
    "the general idea about classification of modes of perturbations is based on a very simple definition of the isocurvature modes .",
    "they do not perturb the gravitational potential .",
    "this means that the fluctuations of the total matter density @xmath17 are zero ( see burns 2001 ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the density of each massive species including baryons and different kinds of the cdm particles , @xmath20 is the density contrast for each massive component , @xmath21 is the density ratio between neutrinos @xmath22 and black body radiation @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the cmb temperature perturbations .",
    "we would like to point out that in the definition of the isocurvature perturbations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) one can find some peculiar mode ( or modes ) which compensates the baryonic perturbations potential , i.e. , it corresponds to the condition @xmath25 for some @xmath26 component of the cdm particles mixture .",
    "we call below this mode as a compensate isocurvature mode ( cim ) for the @xmath26-component of the dark matter particles .",
    "if several components of the dark matter particles take part in the cim formation , we will continue to call them as @xmath26- component .. this means that the cim are equivalent to an isotemperature perturbations .",
    "note , that exactly the same mode was described by abramo & finelli ( 2001 ) , but for compensation between quintessence scalar field perturbations and some kind of the cdm - particles . ]    in principle , for the cim perturbations it is possible to assume that the amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 are less than unity or @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "one of the most interesting cases corresponds to the model with @xmath31 , which means that some patches of the cosmological matter do not contain the cdm @xmath26-particles , but at the same patches there are non - linear clouds of the baryonic matter which compensate the perturbations of the gravitational potential .",
    "below we will assume that a typical mass scale of the cim perturbations is smaller than the typical galactic mass scale .",
    "this means that cim perturbations do not influence on the cmb anisotropy formation as the additional sources of perturbations , but they can transform the kinetics of the hydrogen recombination .",
    "this leads to the transformation of the corresponding @xmath32 power spectrum of the cmb for the adiabatic fluctuations at the scales above a few mpc .",
    "it is necessary to note that the idea about non - homogeneous distribution of the baryonic matter at small scales is not new .",
    "the importance of the entropic perturbations in the history of the cosmological expansion was _ ad hoc _ demonstrated by doroshkevich , zeldovich and novikov ( 1967 ) and peebles ( 1967,1994 ) and recently was generalized taking into account multi - species structure of the cosmological plasma by gnedin & ostriker ( 1992 ) , hogan ( 1993 ) & loeb ( 1993 ) , peebles & juszkiewich ( 1998 ) .",
    "the possible inhomogeneities of the baryon fraction distribution in the epoch of the nucleosynthesis ( inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis -ibbs ) was widely discussed in the literature ( see for the review by jedamzik & rehm 2001 ) in connection with quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "but the typical scales of such kind of peculiarities are extremely small compared to the typical mass scale @xmath33 for the isocurvature perturbations . other events or processes",
    "have been suggested as possible sources of the isocurvature perturbations partly connected with the baryon re - distribution in the space .",
    "for example , cosmic strings and corresponding currents and magnetic fields could generate specific features in the baryonic matter ( malaney & butler 1989 ) .",
    "yokoyama & sato ( 1991 ) , dolgov & silk ( 1993 ) , polarsky & starobinsky ( 1994 ) , novikov , schmalzing & mukhanov ( 2000 ) have shown a few different ways for the generation of the isocurvature perturbation in the framework of the inflation theory .    in connection with the above ",
    "mentioned problem of the baryonic fraction determination from the cosmological nucleosynthesis and the cmb anisotropy data we dedicate our paper to the re - examination of the models with non - linear sub - horizon - scale ( at the epoch of the hydrogen recombination ) baryonic clouds with @xmath34 .",
    "such inhomogeneities do not manifest in the cmb anisotropy ( because of the extremely small scales ) but manifest themselves by the transformation of the ionization history of the primeval hydrogen - helium plasma at redshift @xmath35 .",
    "all these factors should be taken into account in the reconstruction of the ionization history of the universe especially at the period of the cosmological hydrogen recombination .",
    "the reason for importance of the possible very small scale entropy perturbations at the epoch of recombination is connected with the very small mean free path of the ly-@xmath36 photons at @xmath35 : @xmath37 cm which corresponds to the baryon mass @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the solar mass .",
    "high amplitude baryonic clouds with masses @xmath40 could transform the process of recombination at the beginning and dissipate during recombination up to the crucial masses @xmath41 ( liu et al . 2001 ) . we will show that if the typical masses of the clouds @xmath42 are @xmath43 the hydrogen and helium recombination inside and outside clouds goes independently .",
    "due to non - linear dependency of the electronic ionization fraction @xmath44 on the baryon density the hydrogen and helium inside the clouds recombine faster than outside them .",
    "thus the dynamics of the mean value of the electronic ionization fraction @xmath44 which plays a crucial role in the cmb anisotropy and polarization formation decreases slower than , for example , in the uniform model with the mean value of the baryonic fraction of the matter .",
    "we will show that in the cloudy baryonic plasma the kinetics of the @xmath45 recombination is closer to the delayed recombination model by peebles et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with concrete relation between @xmath46 and @xmath47 parameters of their model and amplitudes of perturbations and the filling factor of the baryonic clouds",
    ". we will show how sensitive the @xmath32 power spectrum of the cmb anisotropy is to the mentioned above parameters of the baryonic clouds .",
    "we will discuss possible manifestation of the small scale perturbations in the map and upcoming planck observational data .",
    "we consider a model with non - linear baryonic perturbations at the small scales ( @xmath48 ) . in the analysis of the kinetics of recombination",
    "we will take into account electrons , protons , ionized and neutral hydrogen and helium . for simplicity",
    "we suppose that all baryonic clouds have the same characteristic sizes @xmath49 , which are much smaller than the size of the horizon @xmath50 close to the period of recombination ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath51 .",
    "we denote @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 the baryon density inside the clouds , outside of them and the mean density at the scales much greater than @xmath49 and distances between them , respectively .",
    "we have the following relations @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the volume fraction of the clouds .",
    "we denote @xmath57    we can write down the following relations between mean value of the baryon density and inner and outer values @xmath58 and @xmath59    as mentioned in introduction the presence of the baryonic clouds in the primordial hydrogen - helium plasma at redshift @xmath60 changes the dynamics of the recombination due to non - linear dependence @xmath44 on the baryon density . below we will describe the kinetics of the recombination in a cloudy baryonic fraction of the universe taking into account that the diffusion damping is not important for the clouds with @xmath61 . as it was shown by liu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , during the period of recombination diffusion of baryons from inner to outer regions of the clouds can suppress any small scale irregularities inside the clumps . the natural length of this process is close to the jeans length @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the baryonic speed of sound and @xmath64 is the corresponding time when the plasma became transparent for the cmb radiation .",
    "note that our aim is to predict some possible observational features in the cmb anisotropy and polarization power spectrum connected with possible non - uniform distribution of baryons on very small scales : much smaller than @xmath50 , but greater than the jeans scale @xmath65 .",
    "that means that for all adiabatic perturbations at the scales @xmath66 ( which are the source of the doppler peaks in the cmb anisotropy and polarization power spectra ) the evolution during the period of recombination depends not on the ionization fraction inside or outside the clouds but rather on the mean value of ionization fraction over the scales of adiabatic perturbations . as we mentioned above this mean ionization fraction",
    "does not correspond to the ionization fraction for the mean value of the baryonic density due to non - linear effects . for our analysis",
    "we use two basic software packages , recfast ( seager et al . 2000 ) and cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) with modification for the cloudy baryonic model .",
    "let us start from cmbfast modification because the calculation of the cmb anisotropy and polarization power spectra depends on the number density of free electrons .    for the cloudy baryonic model we introduce the mean value of the electron density @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the fraction of volume with clouds from eq.(2 ) . for the baryonic clouds with scales",
    "@xmath69 we can neglect diffusion of baryons and @xmath70 photons and describe the recombination process inside and outside the clouds separately .",
    "in such a case we can write down @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the ionization fraction and helium mass fractions for inner and outer regions .",
    "note that by definition @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number density of neutral and ionized hydrogen .",
    "let us introduce the mean value of the ionization fraction @xmath78 , @xmath79 then @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denotes the mean mass fraction of helium .",
    "the second remark is related with the modification of the cmbfast code , particularly with the characteristic time of friction @xmath83 between electron and radiation fluids before and at the period of the recombination .",
    "let us consider the hydrodynamic equations for baryon - electron fluid and radiation using the newtonian approximation .",
    "following liu et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we have @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath87 is the gravitational potential , dot denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath88 ( @xmath89 , the speed of light @xmath90 ) , @xmath23 is the density of the cmb , @xmath91 is the local concentration of electrons , @xmath92 is hydrodynamic velocity of radiation ( dipole moment ) and @xmath93 is the thompson cross - section . in our cloudy baryonic model",
    "we can define the large scale adiabatic tail of the perturbations of the matter and the small scale cim tail as follows , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the linear adiabatic perturbation of the hydrodynamic quantities . by the definition @xmath99",
    "means average over the scales @xmath100 but @xmath101 for all @xmath102 fourier harmonics of the adiabatic perturbations . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhyd1 ] ) and ( [ eq : eqhyd2 ] ) we can describe the evolution of the velocity perturbations for the adiabatic modes @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath17 are the pressure and the density of the baryon - photon fluid and @xmath105 means a linear part of the perturbations . as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhyd3 ] ) in the cloudy baryonic matter the characteristic time of baryon - radiation friction is @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the proton mass .",
    "this time @xmath108 depends on the local ratio @xmath109 .",
    "the ionization fraction @xmath110 could be written down in the following form , @xmath111 where @xmath112 thus eq .  ( [ eq : eqhyd5 ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : eqhyd6 ] ) generalize the standard homogeneous model of the cmb anisotropy and polarization formation on the cloudy baryonic model of the universe .",
    "note the difference between eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhyd3 ] ) and the standard kinetic equation for the cmb anisotropy formation . whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhyd3 ] ) depends on @xmath110 , the standard equation depends on @xmath113,(see eq.(8 ) and ( 9 ) ) .",
    "the corresponding modification of the cmbfast code leads to modification of recfast programme which calculates the kinetics of recombination inside and outside the small - scale baryonic clouds as a function of cosmological parameter @xmath114 , density contrast @xmath115 and volume fraction @xmath56 .",
    "in fig.1 and fig.2 we plot the functions @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath113 , and @xmath110 for different mean values of the baryonic density @xmath116 and @xmath9 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "as one can see from these figures the fractions of ionization @xmath119 and @xmath110 have different shapes and different asymptotic at low redshifts .    in the next section",
    "we describe the results of the corresponding numerical computations",
    ". however , some preliminary discussions could be very useful for understanding of the most important peculiarities connected with two characteristic functions of ionization @xmath113 and @xmath120 .",
    "firstly we would like to point out that in the case when the volume fraction @xmath56 is small ( @xmath121 , but @xmath122 ! ) the function @xmath110 should be very close to @xmath123 while @xmath113 practically does not change . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhyd5 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhyd6 ] ) we can immediately find an asymptotic of the function @xmath113 at low redshifts : @xmath124 .",
    "that means that the silk damping scale which is very sensitive on the parameter @xmath125 , which is proportional to @xmath126 , should increase due to the increasing of the effective ionization ratio @xmath127 .",
    "thus we can conclude that in cloudy baryonic model the position and amplitudes of the doppler peaks in the @xmath32 power spectrum differ from the same values in the standard non- cloudy model with the same mean value of the baryon density @xmath116 .",
    "secondly , it is well known that the so - called `` visibility function '' @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the thompson optical depth , depends on the function @xmath113 .",
    "because @xmath130 , and @xmath131 we can conclude that in our model the kinetics of recombination is similar ( in general ) to the models with additional sources of the ionization .",
    "one additional comment is related with the delayed recombination model by peebles et al .",
    "( 2000 ) mentioned in introduction .",
    "we would like to note , that the physical basis of their model and our cloudy baryonic model are completely different , but the numerical data for the corresponding function @xmath44 in the model by peebles et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and @xmath113 in our model are close to each other .",
    "if we compare the solid lines with the marked lines in fig.1 , we can conclude that change of the ionization fraction @xmath113 plays a role in the corresponding delay of the recombination with respect to the recombination inside the clouds . to understand the change of the cmb anisotropy and polarization power spectra we need to compare the ionization fraction for outer regions and @xmath113 . from fig.1",
    "it is clearly seen that in such a case we can introduce the term `` accelerated recombination '' because the mean ionization @xmath132 faster then @xmath133 for the outer regions at the same values of the @xmath5 parameter . in both cases , following peebles",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , we can describe the number of additional resonance @xmath70 quanta produced at the epoch of the hydrogen recombination by the sources of ionization @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the efficiency of the @xmath70 quanta production , @xmath136 is the hubble parameter and @xmath137 is the number density of baryons .",
    "according to peebles et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , @xmath138 describes the productivity of the sources of additional resonance quanta , which leads to the delay of the hydrogen recombination .",
    "formally , if @xmath139 then recombination goes faster and we have `` accelerated recombination '' regime .",
    "thus , the difference between these two situations is related to the definition of the background state ( inner or outer parts of the clouds ) .",
    "note that for the cmb power spectrum calculations the term `` accelerated recombination '' is preferable because it depends mainly on the characteristics of the outer zones .",
    "for numerical calculations of the cmb anisotropy and polarization power spectra we will use the modified cmbfast code taking into account the above - mentioned peculiarities of the ionization history of the plasma .",
    "we take into account the difference of the @xmath140 mass fractions @xmath141 for inner and outer zones into account , using well estimated dependence of @xmath141 on ( @xmath5 ) parameter ( olive , steigman & walker 2000 ) . for illustration of the importance of the cloudy structure at small scales on the cmb anisotropy formation in fig.3 we plot the function @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) , where @xmath32 is the anisotropy power spectrum , for the cosmological model with @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath9 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 for the corresponding model with the uniform baryonic matter distribution and scale invariant power spectrum of the initial adiabatic perturbations .",
    "we choose @xmath118 , and density contrast between inner and outer zones @xmath117 .",
    "as one can see from fig.3 , the presence of the clouds before and during the period of the hydrogen and helium recombination significantly perturbed the corresponding @xmath148 function .",
    "the same conclusion follows from fig.4 for the polarization of the cmb in the cloudy baryonic model .",
    "as it is seen from fig.4 the more complicated ionization history of the plasma in the cloudy model leads to the decreasing of the corresponding power spectrum of the polarization at @xmath149 due to the increasing of the effective dissipation scale .",
    "it is worth noting that in our cloudy model we do not take into account the possible reionization of the hydrogen at low redshift ( @xmath150 ) due to the influence of the additional sources on the ionization balance .",
    "this modification is the standard part of the cmb anisotropy and polarization spectrum calculations using cmbfast codes .",
    "but it is clear that in cloudy baryonic universe the mean value of the optical depth must be related to the mean ionization fraction @xmath113 for corresponding values of the @xmath116 parameters .",
    "as it was mentioned in introduction , the baryonic fraction of the matter is one of the most important cosmological parameters , which determines the most preferable model of the universe .",
    "two crucial parameters of the theory are now under discussion , i.e. , the light chemical elements abundance , which is related directly to the sbbn predictions , and the @xmath151 parameter which can be determined from the current and future cmb observations . in both cases the determination of the parameters depends on the hypothesis about the spatial distribution of the baryonic fraction of the matter and can be tested by the cmb experiments such as the launched map and the future planck missions .    in our paper we have shown how important it is the possible baryonic inhomogeneity at small scales ( @xmath152 ) in the cmb anisotropy and polarization formation through distortions of the cosmological recombination .",
    "the extremal case , when the density contrast @xmath153 , shows that the clumps in the baryon fraction of the matter can significantly change the amplitudes and positions of the doppler peaks in the cmb anisotropy and polarization power spectrum .",
    "for example in the above mentioned @xmath153 model the differences between @xmath32 for the anisotropy and for the polarization in the models with @xmath154 ( no clouds ) and @xmath155 ( with clouds ) are presented in fig.5 in a form of the following the functions . for the anisotropy @xmath156 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 denote the non - cloudy and cloudy model , respectively , and the index",
    "@xmath86 corresponds to the anisotropy spectrum .",
    "the analogous definition of the @xmath159 function is used in fig.5 for the cmb polarization .",
    "as one can see from fig.5 , practically for all ranges of multipoles the differences between cloudy and non - cloudy models are observable for the planck mission . moreover , if the parameter @xmath160 , then we need to include the possible cloudy baryonic model in the schemes of the cosmological parameter extractions from the current and future cmb anisotropy and polarization data",
    ". as one can see from eq.(4 ) and eq.(5 ) , if @xmath161 , then the difference between @xmath53 and mean baryon density is @xmath162 . according to the predicted accuracy of the cosmological parameter extraction from the planck mission , the corresponding uncertainties for",
    "the baryonic fraction of the matter @xmath163 must be less then a few percents .",
    "taking conservative limit @xmath164 and @xmath165 we can obtain that the corresponding fraction @xmath56 should be detectable by the planck satellite , if @xmath166 .",
    "we would like to point out that our simple model of the baryonic clouds is based on the one possible modes of the isocurvature perturbations at the small scales .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the more complicated models of the initial perturbations .",
