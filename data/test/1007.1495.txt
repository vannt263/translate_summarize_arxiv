    "since the discovery and application of carbon fullerenes and carbon nanotubes(cnts ) @xcite , stable cage and tube - like structures have attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "these structures have generated great interest in creating analogous structures from other elements that are suitable for applications in nanodevices .",
    "silicon and carbon are members of the same group in the periodic table , suggesting a potential ability to form similar structures .",
    "furthermore , due to the fundamental importance of silicon in present - day integrated circuits , substantial efforts have focused on investigating nano - scale forms of silicon , both for the purpose of further miniaturizing the current microelectronic devices and in the hopes of unveiling new properties that often arise at the nano - scale level@xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to form cages or tubes like carbon fullerenes or nanotubes purely with si atoms because silicon does not favor the @xmath0@xmath1 hybridization that carbon does .",
    "carbon normally forms strong @xmath2 bonds through @xmath3 hybridization , which can facilitate the formation of two - dimensional spherical cages ( or planar structures such as benzene and graphene ) .",
    "silicon , on the other hand , usually forms covalent @xmath4 bonds through @xmath5 hybridization , which favor a three dimensional diamond - like structure .",
    "fortunately , si cage clusters can be synthesized by adding suitable foreign atoms to terminate the dangling si bonds that inherently arise in cage - like networks . many researchers@xcite reported that transition metal(tm ) atoms are the most suitable element for cage formation due to their @xmath6 band features . in addition",
    ", rare earth atoms have been doped into silicon cages@xcite .",
    "another way to stabilize the si cage is to use hydrogens to terminate the cluster surface@xcite , which is similar to the dodecahedral c@xmath7h@xmath7 .",
    "several hollow and nonhollow silicon nanotube structures have been proposed and theoretically characterized in recent years @xcite .",
    "these structures , which were proposed based on intuition or the behavior of similar materials , include the following :    \\(1 ) regular polyhedron stacking nanotubes @xcite ,    \\(2 ) surface capped polygonal prism stacking nanotubes @xcite ,    \\(3 ) polycrystalline forms of nanowires @xcite ,    \\(4 ) metal encapsulated polygonal prism nanotubes @xcite ,    \\(5 ) carbon nanotube like structures @xcite ,    \\(6 ) fullerene - based structures @xcite ,    \\(7 ) metal centered fullerene - based structures @xcite ,    \\(8 ) hydrogenated single - wall silicon cnt like nanotubes @xcite ,    \\(9 ) exohydrogenated fullerene - like structures @xcite ,    \\(10 ) multiwall nanotubes @xcite .",
    "in the cases of ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , similar to pure silicon cages , it was reported to be difficult to form hollow single wall si nanotubes because of the @xmath5 nature of si atom .",
    "cases ( 4 )  and  ( 7 ) proposed that metal doping may be a good way to terminate the dangling bond of silicon bond in the tube , but this approach was limited to tubes with very small radii(@xmath8@xmath91 nm )",
    ".    however , if the lateral surfaces of the dangling bonds are terminated by hydrogens , the resulting cage - like silicon clusters may be perfect building blocks for si nanotubes . theoretically , every si atom has three neighboring si atoms in the nanotube , and these have an @xmath0@xmath10 type bond nature with one h terminating the dangling bond .",
    "moreover , the success of this approach is suggested by the fact that in experiments , the surfaces of silicon nanowires(sinws ) and silicon nanotubes(sints ) are always passivated by hydrogen atoms @xcite or by silicon oxide layers @xcite .",
    "this work presents a theoretical study of hydrogenated cluster assembled silicon nanotubes using density functional theory(dft ) calculation .",
    "a series of finite and infinite silicon nanotubes assembled by hydrogenated cage - like clusters was obtained .",
    "additionally , the electronic and magnetic properties of sints can be accurately tuned by doping impurities at the center of the hollow tube .",
    "one interesting result was that a metal to half - metal transition was observed in fe - doped sints with the increasing of tube radius .",
    "all theoretical computations were performed with the dft approach implemented in the dmol@xmath10 package @xcite , using all electron treatment and the double numerical basis including the @xmath6-polarization function(dnp)@xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation interaction was treated within the generalized gradient approximation(gga ) using blyp functional .",
    "self - consistent field calculations were performed with a convergence criterion of 2@xmath1110@xmath12 hartree on total energy .",
    "the @xmath13  ( @xmath14=16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 ) clusters were optimized first , and some of the initial structures in our work were based on the results reported in refs .   & . after obtaining stable single clusters",
    ", we took these clusters as basic units ( keep them as original ) and stacked the clusters with a certain @xmath14 along the axis of symmetry to construct finite nanotubes .    for infinite one dimensional nanotubes ,",
    "the periodically repeated units were placed in supercells .",
    "the supercell is cubic in geometry with the dimensions 25@xmath1125@xmath11@xmath15@xmath16 , where the direction of @xmath15@xmath16 was defined as the axial direction of the nanotubes .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were employed along the nanowire axis to create , in effect , continuous wires . meanwhile , a sufficiently large vacuum region was introduced along the other directions is configured between the wires .",
    "the fully optimized structures of @xmath17 ( @xmath14=16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 ) clusters that have been fully optimized are shown in fig .",
    "it was very interesting to see that all these structures shared the following common characteristics : 1 .",
    "all of them were fullerene - like hollow structures .",
    "each si atom had three si neighbors , with one h atom saturating the dangling bond of each silicon atom outside the cage to fulfill an @xmath18 type hybridization bond .",
    "3 . all structures consisted of @xmath19 pentagons and two other polyhedrons at the two ends , with the edge number of these two polyhedrons as @xmath20 . meanwhile , these two polyhedrons were parallel to each other and there was a relative angle of @xmath21 between them .",
    "thus each vertex atom of one polyhedron fell exactly in the middle of one edge in the other polyhedron .",
    "specifically , for @xmath22 , the cage was composed of 12 pentagons , which was very similar to the structure of carbon fullerene @xmath23 .",
    "structures of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 have been widely discussed in very recent years @xcite and the structural information we obtained was consistent with these reports .",
    "taking these original clusters original as basic units , we stacked them along the central axis of the cage to form finite nanotubes .",
    "the two adjacent cages shared the same polyhedron .",
    "we noted that for the shared polyhedron , there was no need for have hydrogen saturation because each si atom already had 4 si neighbors and thus the @xmath18 hybridization bond type was fulfilled .",
    "the molecular formula of the finite tube was classified as @xmath27 , where the measure of radius @xmath28 was the number of atoms of one shared polyhedron and the measure of length @xmath29 was the number of repeated units .",
    "after full optimization , for one certain value @xmath28(@xmath28=4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ) , and for @xmath29 range from 2 to 4 concerned in the present work , the tube was always straight and stable .",
    "furthermore , if the number of repeated units @xmath29 was fixed , the length of the tubes decreased with the increasing @xmath28 .",
    "the angles of h - si - si and si - si - si inside the repeated units were all about 109@xmath30 , which were very close to the 109.5@xmath30 of @xmath18 , but the si - si - si angle  ( angle @xmath31 in fig .  [ fig2 ] ( b ) ) between two units became smaller and smaller with the increasing of tube radii ( from 127.8@xmath30 of @xmath28=4 to 99.0@xmath30 of @xmath28=8 ) .",
    "even though , the growth direction and the achievable length of the nanotubes are the main experimental concerns , previous theoretical studies have paid little attention to these issues . here , we chose @xmath32 nanotubes to examine if straight tubes were more stable than bent nanotubes .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath33 ( @xmath28=5 , @xmath29=3)(fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) ) had an isomer ( a@xmath34 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( @xmath35 ) ) that was bent to 120@xmath30 from 180@xmath30 , but the total energy ( e@xmath36 ) of ( @xmath35 ) was 0.02ev higher than that of the straight tube ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "likewise , @xmath38 ( @xmath28=5 , @xmath29=4 ) has two isomers @xmath39(fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( @xmath39 ) ) and @xmath40 ( fig .  [ fig2](@xmath40 ) ) , where the structure @xmath39 was a tube in which the unit at the end was bent , and structure @xmath40 was distorted further .",
    "these isomers were less stable because the total energy of ( @xmath41 ) was higher than that of the linear structure by 0.021@xmath42 or 0.034@xmath42 , respectively . for hydrogenate silicon tubes ,",
    "if one tube was bent by an angle , the distance between h atoms of adjacent units would decrease and the coulomb repulsion between them would makes the total energy greater than the straight energy . consequently , the linear structure was relatively more stable than bent structures .      in order to measure the relative stability of the tubes as well as the influence of the length and width , we calculated the averaged binding energy  ( @xmath43 ) and dissociation energies  ( @xmath44 ) of these tubes .",
    "the @xmath43 and de for finite tubes were defined by the following formulae : @xmath45\\}/{(5mk+3m)}\\\\ & ( m=4 - 8 ;   ~k=1 - 4 ) \\label{a } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    @xmath46\\\\ & ( m=4 - 8 ; ~k=1 - 4~ ) \\end{split}\\label{a}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath41[@xmath27 ] represent the total energies of the si atom , h atom , sih dimer and the @xmath27 tube , respectively .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( a ) , the binding energy @xmath51 of the finite tube increases gradually as the length increased for a certain @xmath28 .",
    "this correlation indicates that the tube became increasingly stable as it became longer .",
    "on the other hand , the stability of the tubes did not depend linearly on the tube s radius , which was represented by @xmath28 . for any @xmath29 ,",
    "the most stable tubes were at @xmath28=5 or @xmath28=6 .",
    "de is the energy needed to remove a si - h dimer from the end of a tube , and this parameter provided another method to probe the tube stability .",
    "the curves of de  ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( b ) ) indicate that it was more difficult to remove a si - h dimer from the tubes with @xmath28=5 and 6 because these two specific tubes satisfied @xmath5 hybridization well .",
    "this is another indication of the fact that tubes with @xmath28=5 or 6 are the most stable .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( c ) plots the variation of the highest occupied molecular orbital  ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital  ( lumo ) gaps of the finite tubes .",
    "the quantum confinement concept demands a larger gap for a smaller size .",
    "the authors in ref .   ever argued that the quantum confinement concept was not fully applicable to saturated systems such as @xmath13 cages .",
    "our work also provides evidence on the limitation of the quantum confinement concept in interpreting the gaps of hydrogenated silicon nanotubes .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( c ) , when @xmath28 is fixed , the gaps between homo - lumo became smaller with increasing length .",
    "however , there was a big jump in the gap from a single cluster to a two - unit tube .",
    "this difference could come from a hybrid bond around the si@xmath52 cylinder joints which was different from the fully hydrogenated silicon atoms in a single cluster .",
    "moreover , the coulomb repulsion between hydrogen atoms of an adjacent unit could play a role in defining gaps , as explained below .",
    "the tubes of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 had similar homo - lumo gaps due to analogous structural parameters including bond angle , length and width .",
    "the gaps of larger radii tubes @xmath56 and @xmath57 tubes were much smaller than those of the smaller radii tubes @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . similar to ref .  , we estimated the effective volume per electron @xmath58 by drawing two concentric cylinders with @xmath59 and @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) up to the layer of hydrogen and silicon .",
    "the @xmath58 was defined as : @xmath61 \\label{c}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 was the number of electron and @xmath15 was the length of the cylinder ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "@xmath58 is the measures of electron `` confinement '' , which would lead to the same order of gap performance according to the quantum confinement concept .",
    "hence , in our work , the order of effective volume per electron of @xmath58[@xmath28=7 ] @xmath63 @xmath58[@xmath28=6 ] @xmath63 @xmath58[@xmath28=8 ] @xmath63 @xmath58[@xmath28=4 ] @xmath63 @xmath58[@xmath28=5 ] , as in table  [ table1 ] , would have resulted in a homo - lumo gap order of @xmath64  [ @xmath28=7]@xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=6 ] @xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=8 ] @xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=4 ] @xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=5 ] . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) and table  [ table1 ] , the homo - lumo gap order was @xmath64  [ @xmath28=6 ] @xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=4 ] @xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=5 ] @xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=7 ] @xmath65 @xmath64  [ @xmath28=8 ] .",
    "the homo - lumo gap order only followed the rule of quantum confinement for small radii tubes(@xmath28=4 , 5 , 6 ) .",
    "the limitation of quantum confinement for large radii tubes ( @xmath28=7 , 8) may arise from the fact that these tubes have a smaller distance between the h - h bonds of neighboring units(@xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "for example , @xmath66 of 4.206 for @xmath28=4 compared to that of 2.723 or 2.567 for @xmath28=7 or 8 .",
    "that is to say , for one - dimensional finite hydrogenated silicon nanotubes , quantum confinement only worked for small radii tubes .    to summarize , in addition to the quantum confinement , the effects of suitable bond angle(@xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) ) , and coulomb repulsion between h atoms also played important roles in affecting the homo - lumo gaps of @xmath27 systems .",
    "the increased stability of finite nanotubes with an increasing number of units allowed us to examine further the stability of the infinite nanotubes specifical with a stoichiometric @xmath68 .",
    "this infinite tube was built from finite @xmath27 by removing a @xmath69@xmath70 on one side and @xmath28 h atoms on the other side to form a repeated unit .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows two repeated cells of the infinite tubes with different radii .",
    "all of these tubes had the stacking of sih cages in common , with the wire axis lying in the center .",
    "the axis passed through the centers of buckled @xmath69 rings , and two adjacent cages shared one ring .",
    "full structure relaxation indicated that the infinite nanotubes had similar geometric structures to finite ones , but the tube lengths had slightly changed .",
    "the lenths of @xmath71 and @xmath72 tubes became 0.08 and 0.11 longer than the finite ones , but for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath74 the lengths became 0.075 , 0.212 and 0.365 shorter .",
    "the tube widths and si - h bond lengths were almost the same as for the finite ones .",
    "the binding energies of the infinite tube shown in table  [ table2 ] were slightly larger than those of finite tubes , which meant that it was possible to synthesize tubes long enough .",
    "the silicon tube had a relatively large band gap(@xmath75 )  ( 2.296ev-3.009ev ) , which implied that it was a wide gap semiconductor .",
    "the band gap of the tube was inversely proportional to the radius .",
    "the band gaps of carbon nanotubes always decrease in an oscillatory behavior with increasing radius because of the @xmath76 and @xmath4 hybridization with a small radius and a large curvature .",
    "however , for exhydrogenated single - wall carbon nanotubes(swcnt ) , the gap decreases monotonously @xcite .",
    "this difference can be easily understood by the fact that silicon atoms have @xmath5-type bond properties .",
    "the band - gap trend of silicon nanotubes is similar to that of hydrogenated swcnts as described in other reports  @xcite on si nanotubes or nanowires .",
    "endohedral doping is an effective way to tune the properties of cage or tube - like clusters .",
    "therefore , we next investigated the effect of endohedral doping on the geometric stability , conductivity and magnetism of the silicon nanotubes .",
    "specially , fe doping was systematically analyzed .",
    "the stability was robust when fe atoms were inserted at the center of the hollow tube(fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , the lattice underwent a very small expansion and exiting large band gap in silicon nanotube disappeared .",
    "subsequently , the doped tube turned into a metal .    in previous reports , many types of metal atoms were inserted at the center of the silicon hollow nano - clusters @xcite or nanotubes @xcite , but the primary role of the doping atom was to saturate the dangling bond of silicon cages or tubes .",
    "therefore , the central atom had a strong hybridization with the exterior silicon cage , and the magnetic moments always became very small , or at times completely quenched .",
    "however , in the case presented here , the outside cage was saturated by hydrogen atoms .",
    "thus , the fe atom had only a weak interaction with the silicon atoms . as seen in table  [ table2 ] ,",
    "the doped tube always maintained a relatively large magnetic moment that originated from the @xmath6-electron of the fe atom , and the variation of the fe moment increased as the radius increased .",
    "the most intriguing phenomenon occurred when the radii of the fe - doped hydrogenated silicon tubes increased : a metal to half - metal transition was observed from the spin resolved density of states ( dos ) for the @xmath31 and @xmath77 channels of nanotubes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . from @xmath28=4 to @xmath28=6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](a)(c ) ) , both the @xmath31 spin and the @xmath77 spin contributed to the dos at the fermi level . with the increase in @xmath28 , the dos peak of the @xmath31 spin at fermi level shifted down , while the peak of the @xmath77 spin below the fermi level shifted up towards the fermi level . when it comes to @xmath28=7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( d))and @xmath28=8 ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ( e ) ) ,",
    "the @xmath31 spin states disappeared at the fermi level , and a band gap appeared for this spin channel . for the @xmath77 spin channel , a dos peak still emerged at the fermi level .",
    "in other words , the nanotube turned into an insulator for @xmath31 spin and a conductor for the @xmath77 spin . from the spin - resolved dos contributed by fe , si and h atoms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](f ) , we found that the centered fe atoms mainly contributed to the total number of @xmath77 spin states , and si atoms made only very modest contributions to the states at the fermi level .",
    "the above phenomenon resulted from the hybridization between fe and silicon atoms .",
    "for small radii of @xmath28=4 , fe atoms have a stronger hybridization with the outside silicon atoms , but the hybridization becomes smaller as the radius increases .",
    "when @xmath28=7 and 8 , the coupling between the fe atom and the tube becomes so weak that the fe atom is almost an isolated atom .",
    "thus , the atomic properties of fe atom were recovered to a large extent .",
    "the electron configuration of fe is 3@xmath6@xmath784@xmath79@xmath1 . according to pauli exclusion and hund s rule",
    ", five 3@xmath6 electrons would occupy five @xmath6 orbitals with @xmath31 spin , while the last 3@xmath6 electron will occupy @xmath6 orbitals with @xmath77 spin .",
    "when such atoms are weakly coupled together to form a linear chain , highly spin - polarized behavior can result .",
    "such behavior was also been predicted in durgun s work@xcite which found that hydrogen passivated silicon nanowires could exhibit the half - metallic state when decorated with specific transition metal(tm ) atoms .",
    "this situation was very similar to the half - metallicity introduced by the weakly coupled carbon atomic chain in single - walled carbon nanotubes@xcite . in this case , the carbon atoms in the chain have a very weak interactions with their neighbors and the atomic behavior is largely recovered .",
    "the large magnetic moments of the fe doped silicon nanotubes and their half - metallic behavior are promising for application of these materials in magnetic devices and spintronic applications .",
    "a series of finite and infinite hydrogenated silicon nanotubes were systematically studied by performing first - principles dft - gga calculations .",
    "our results demonstrated that one - dimensional sints @xmath27 can be built by stacking @xmath80 clusters along the central axis of the cage .",
    "the finite tubes had large homo - lumo gaps .",
    "when @xmath28=5 and 6 , the tubes were more stable than other sizes because these tubes had the most suitable bond angles .",
    "infinite tubes had similar geometric structures to the finite tubes and presented wide gap semiconductivity due to their large band gaps .",
    "the band gap decreased monotonously as the radius increased .",
    "endohedral fe doping greatly modified the properties of the silicon nanotubes .",
    "for example , fe doping can tune the silicon nanotube from semiconductor to metal .",
    "additionally , a metal to half - metal transition was observed in fe - doped sints with an increasing tube radius .",
    "these silicon nanotubes could be useful for nanoelectronic devices .",
    "in particular , a half - metallicity of the fe - doped silicon nanotubes may find important application in spintronics .",

    "<S> density functional calculations were performed to systematically study a series of finite and infinite cluster - assembled silicon nanotubes ( sints ) . </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional sints can be prepared by proper assembly of hydrogenated cage - like silicon clusters to form semiconductors with a large band gap , and their electronic properties can be accurately tuned by transition metal doping in the center of the tubes . specifically , doping with fe made the sints metallic and magnetic materials . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , a metal to half - metal transition was observed with increasing tube radius in fe - doped sints , which demonstrates that sints doped with magnetic elements may find important applications in spintronics .    </S>",
