    ", silicon would be the desired material system , but silicon does not provide the optical functionality essential to so many prospective applications .",
    "this is where iii - v materials step in .",
    "for example , quantum key distribution kits are already commercially available , but can one build a quantum telecom network ? alternatively , linear optics approaches to quantum computing are some of the most advanced . but photon - photon interactions are weak , making deterministic gates impossible to implement without devices with single photon optical nonlinearities . also , photonic q - bits travel at the speed of light making it difficult to store information at a fixed location .",
    "atoms have all the quantum properties required to build a q - bit .",
    "atom - like properties can be replicated in semiconductors using quantum dots .",
    "the dots trap electrons in discrete energy - levels , energetically isolated from the semiconductor environment , resulting in excitonic ( electron - hole pair ) transitions with an atom - like light - matter interaction that can be used to control the excitonic and spin states of the dots .",
    "many signatures of an atom - like light - matter interaction have been observed , for example rabi rotations @xcite , ramsey interference @xcite , autler - townes doublet @xcite , and mollow triplet @xcite .",

    ", the spin of a carrier trapped in a dot should be a robust q - bit @xcite .",
    "spin relaxation times ( @xmath2 ) of 20-ms , and 0.27-ms have been measured for electron @xcite and hole @xcite spins respectively , and coherence times ( @xmath3 ) in excess of 3-@xmath4s have been reported for electron spins @xcite . using the latest growth , and fabrication techniques it is possible to control properties of the dots such as emission wavelength @xcite , providing access to telecom wavelengths @xcite , and positioning @xcite .",
    "the ability to grow electronically coupled quantum dots @xcite offers the possibility of building a few q - bit register .",
    "whilst , recent demonstrations of non - classical light sources @xcite , and dot in cavity structures with strong single photon optical nonlinearities @xcite are examples of potential quantum devices based on semiconductor quantum dots .",

    "hole spin initialization is achieved by creating a spin - polarized electron - hole pair with near unit probability using a picosecond laser pulse with a pulse - area of @xmath1 , and waiting for the electron to tunnel leaving a spin - polarized hole .",
    "detection of the hole spin is achieved with picosecond resolution using a second pulse resonant with the positive trion transition to convert the hole spin to a charge degree of freedom detectable as a change in photocurrent . using this setup we observe a rabi rotation of the positive trion transition , that is conditional on the hole spin , which for a pulse - area of @xmath0 can be used to impart a phase - shift of @xmath1 between the hole spin states , a non - general single q - bit operation acting on the hole spin .",

    "the beam is split in two , and each arm passed through an independent pulse - shaper .",
    "the pulse - shapers consist of a 4f zero - dispersion compensator @xcite , with a motorized slit in the masking plane to carve a spectrally narrow ( @xmath13 laser pulse with a gaussian shape from the input pulse .",
    "the pulses are then recombined at a beamsplitter , and focused onto the dot using a long working distance microscope objective .",
    "this setup gives independent control of the carrier - frequency , polarization , spectral - width , and pulse - area of each pulse .",
    "we use a photocurrent detection technique @xcite .",
    "when a laser resonantly excites excitonic transitions a photon can be absorbed creating an additional electron - hole pair in the dot .",

    "the maximum signal corresponding to a single exciton is one electron per measurement cycle , corresponding to 12.18 pa for a repetition rate of 76-mhz . in practice",
    "the photocurrent detected for each exciton species is a function of gate voltage , and depends on two factors : the competition between radiative decay and electron tunneling , and a hole tunneling rate that may be slow in comparison to the repetition rate of the laser @xcite .",
    "hence the change in photocurrent detected for a trion , requiring two holes to tunnel , is less than the ideal one electron per pulse . in these experiments",
    "the device is intentionally biased for a relatively fast ( few ns ) hole tunneling rate to achieve a detectable signal .",
    "in addition to the photocurrent arising from the dot , there is a background signal proportional to the incident power .",

    "will now be presented .",

    "since electric - dipole transitions have a @xmath26 angular momentum selection rule , only the bright - excitons with @xmath26 are optically active .    due to a small anisotropy ,",

    "the initial exciton spin state is a linear superposition of the energy eigenstates @xmath36 , which beat with a frequency equal to the fine - structure splitting .",
    "this causes the exciton spin to precess , which acts to erase the spin information . however , if the electron tunneling time is short compared with the period of the fine - structure beat , as is the case in our work , the change in the exciton spin will be small .",
    "the energy - level diagram for the heavy - hole / positive trion 4-level system is shown in the middle section of figure [ fig : pop ] . for zero applied b - field the hole states @xmath37 are degenerate , as are the positive trion states @xmath38 . a spectrally narrow ( fwhm=0.2 mev ) laser pulse is used to resonantly excite the trion transition only .",
    "absorption of a @xmath16 circularly polarized laser pulse would create an electron - hole pair ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "however , the creation of two holes of the same spin is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle , so the absorption only occurs if the dot is occupied by a spin - down hole @xmath22 .",
    "if a trion is created , the electron will tunnel from the dot leaving the dot charged with two holes . if a trion is not created , the dot remains singly charged . in other words , the circular polarization of the detection pulse of pulse - area @xmath1 can be used to select a hole - spin state to map to a trion state , and then electron tunneling converts this information on the hole spin state to a charge degree of freedom , that is electrically detected as a change in photocurrent .",

    "recently kim _ et  al _ have observed the rabi rotation of a negative trion in inas dot using a differential transmission technique @xcite .",
    "rabi rotations have also been reported for an ensemble of inas / gaas dots @xcite , and for a p - shell transition where the dot has an unknown charge state @xcite .",
    "here we have demonstrated a rabi rotation of the positive trion transition that is conditional on the hole spin .",
    "such a manipulation can be used to impart a relative phase - shift of @xmath1 between the hole spin states , a non - general single q - bit operation , as discussed in the next section .",
    "gate to impart a relative phase - shift of @xmath1 between the hole spin states . the @xmath16-polarized control pulse couples the @xmath91 states , and in the rotating frame of the control laser , the energy eigen - states are : @xmath92/\\sqrt{2 } , \\vert\\beta\\rangle=[\\mid\\downarrow\\rangle-\\mid\\downarrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle]/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , with energies of @xmath93 respectively .",
    "the control pulse splits the dressed states @xmath94 and @xmath95 causing the superposition to beat with the rabi frequency .",
    "an initial state of : @xmath96/\\sqrt{2}$ ] evolves to : @xmath97/\\sqrt{2 } , \\theta=\\int\\omega_r(t)dt$ ] . in the case of @xmath98 , the state - vector returns to the",
    "hole - only subspace , having imparted a relative phase - shift of @xmath1 between the hole states @xmath99 . ]",
    "one of the set of single q - bit operations needed for fault tolerant quantum information processing is the @xmath100 operator . where the control pulse imparts a relative phase - shift of @xmath1 between the logical states .",
    "a unitary operator described by the pauli @xmath100 matrix , hence the name . for",
    "a q - bit encoded in the @xmath101 spin - states of the heavy - hole this can be achieved using a circularly polarized control pulse to drive a rabi rotation of the trion transition through an angle of @xmath0 as observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : rr1 ] , and [ fig : rr2 ] , and discussed theoretically in refs . @xcite .",
    "the principle of operation is illustrated in figure [ fig : pauli ] , showing an energy - time graph of the hole - trion states in the rotating frame of the control pulse .",
    "the @xmath16 circularly polarized control pulse couples the @xmath91 states only .",
    "consequently the energy - eigenstates of the system are the dressed states @xmath102/\\sqrt{2}$ ] , with energies of @xmath103 respectively .",
    "if we assume the hole spin is initially in a state : @xmath104/\\sqrt{2}$ ] .",
    "the control pulse shifts the energy of the dressed states , causing each to accumulate a relative phase @xmath105 equal to the integral of the energy - shift @xmath106 , and with respect to the uncoupled reference state @xmath107 .",
    "this causes the hole superposition to evolve to : @xmath97/\\sqrt{2}$ ] . in the case of a control pulse of pulse - area @xmath0 ,",
    "the final state - vector is in the hole sub - space only , and a relative phase - shift of @xmath1 is imparted between the hole spin states resulting in a final state of : @xmath99 .",
    "this geometric phase - shift has been observed for a neutral exciton in a gaas interface quantum dot using a four - wave mixing technique @xcite , supporting this interpretation .",
    "we have proposed and demonstrated the sequential preparation , control and detection of a single hole spin trapped on an ingaas / gaas quantum dot .",
    "our scheme includes a method for high fidelity , triggered preparation of a single spin without the need for a b - field , and a photocurrent detection method capable of the picosecond time resolution needed for evaluating the performance of coherent control operations .",
    "evidence for a non - general manipulation of the hole spin is observed as a rabi rotation of the hole - trion transition that is conditional on the hole spin state .",
    "the use of photocurrent detection gives the advantage of efficient detection , with good signal to noise , enabling relatively fast measurement runs .",
    "a typical rabi rotation measurement , as presented here takes a minute to acquire .",
    "the penalty is a hole coherence time limited by a hole tunneling rate that needs to be faster than the repetition rate of the laser . at the moment , for time - resolved measurements of single quantum dot spins in the coherent control regime , the spin is intentionally decohered to achieve useable signal strengths , compatible with mhz repetition rates . either by using gaas interface dots with short spin coherence times @xcite , or a read - out laser that is the main source of decoherence @xcite . for the future ,",
    "what is needed is a measurement scheme where the measurement is gated , rather than always on .",
    "this is an attractive feature of the kerr - rotation method reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "a key advantage of using a photodiode structure is the potential to use a dynamic gate voltage to switch the device between a low tunneling rate regime with long coherence times , and high tunneling rate for efficient detection .",
    "another important distinction between this and other work is the use of a hole , rather than electron spin . the main source of dephasing for the electron spin , is the interaction with the nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "since the wavefunction of the heavy - hole has a p - type bloch - function , the contact hyperfine interaction is zero , and hence the nuclear spin dephasing should be much weaker for holes @xcite .",
    "although recently fischer _ et  al _ @xcite have pointed out that the hole is not entirely immune to the effects of nuclear spin . at the moment it is not clear if electron or hole spins will make better q - bits , but in principle , one could apply the same ideas to a p - type schottky diode to prepare , and detect a single electron spin .    finally , these experiments are for ingaas / gaas self - assembled quantum dots with high optical quality rather than gaas interface dots .",
    "recently , wu _",
    "et  al _ concluded that it was not possible to observe a rabi rotation of the negative trion in gaas dots @xcite .",
    "this suggests that for the trion transitions the interactions with the environment may be too strong in gaas dots for the transitions to be regarded as atom - like .",
