    "interference between wireless links has been taken into account as a critical problem in wireless communication systems .",
    "recently , interference alignment  ( ia ) was proposed for fundamentally solving the interference problem when there are two communication pairs  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the ia scheme can achieve the optimal degrees of freedom  ( dof ) , which is equal to @xmath4 , in the @xmath1-user interference channel with time - varying channel coefficients . since then , interference management schemes based on ia have been further developed and analyzed in various wireless network environments : multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) interference networks  @xcite , x networks  @xcite , and cellular networks  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , following up on these successes for single - hop networks , more recent and emerging work has studied multihop networks with multiple source - destination ( s  d ) pairs . for the 2-user 2-hop network with 2 relays ( referred to as the @xmath5 interference channel ) , it was shown in  @xcite that interference neutralization combining with symbol extension achieves the optimal dof .",
    "a more challenging network model is to consider @xmath1-user two - hop relay - aided interference channels , consisting of @xmath1 source - destination ( s  d ) pairs and @xmath2 helping relay nodes located in the path between s ",
    "d pairs , so - called the @xmath3 channel .",
    "several achievability schemes have been known for the network , but more detailed understanding is still in progress . by applying the result from  @xcite to the @xmath0 channel , one can show that @xmath4 dof is achieved by using orthogonalize - and - forward relaying , which completely neutralizes interference at all destinations if @xmath2 is greater than or equal to @xmath6 .",
    "another achievable scheme , called aligned network diagonalization , was introduced in  @xcite and was shown to achieve the optimal dof in the @xmath0 channel while tightening the required number of relays .",
    "the scheme in  @xcite is based on the real interference alignment framework  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", however , the system model under consideration assumes that there is no interfering signal between relays and the relays are full - duplex .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite , the @xmath5 interference channel with full - duplex relays interfering with each other was characterized and its dof achievability was shown using aligned interference neutralization .",
    "interference channel  @xcite . ]",
    "on the other hand , there are lots of results on the usefulness of fading in the literature , where one can obtain the multiuser diversity gain in broadcast channels : opportunistic scheduling  @xcite , opportunistic beamforming  @xcite , and random beamforming  @xcite .",
    "such opportunism can also be fully utilized in multi - cell uplink or downlink networks by using an opportunistic interference alignment strategy  @xcite .",
    "various scenarios exploiting the multiuser diversity gain have been studied in cooperative networks by applying an opportunistic two - hop relaying protocol  @xcite and an opportunistic routing  @xcite , and in cognitive radio networks with opportunistic scheduling  @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent results  @xcite have shown how to utilize the opportunistic gain when there are a large number of channel realizations .",
    "more specifically , to amplify signals and cancel interference , the idea of opportunistically pairing complementary channel instances has been studied in interference networks  @xcite and multi - hop relay networks  @xcite . in cognitive radio environments",
    "@xcite , opportunistic spectrum sharing was introduced by allowing secondary users to share the radio spectrum originally allocated to primary users via transmit adaptation in space , time , or frequency .      in this paper , we study the _",
    "@xmath0 channel with interfering relays _ , which can be taken into account as one of practical multi - source interfering relay networks and be regarded as a fundamentally different channel model from the conventional @xmath0 channel in  @xcite .",
    "then , we introduce an _ opportunistic network decoupling ( ond ) _ protocol that achieves full dof with comparatively easy implementation under the channel model .",
    "this work focuses on the @xmath0 channel with one additional assumption that @xmath2 _ half - duplex _ ( hd ) relays interfere with each other , which is a more feasible scenario .",
    "the scheme adopts the notion of the multiuser diversity gain for performing interference management over two hops . more precisely , in our scheme , a scheduling strategy is presented in time - division duplexing ( tdd ) two - hop environments with time - invariant channel coefficients , where a subset of relays is opportunistically selected in terms of producing the minimum total interference level . to improve the spectral efficiency , the _ alternate relaying _ protocol in  @xcite",
    "is employed with a modification , which eventually enables our system to operate in _ virtual full - duplex _ mode . as our main result ,",
    "it turns out that in a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime , the ond protocol asymptotically achieves the min - cut upper bound of @xmath1 dof even in the presence of inter - relay interference and half - duplex assumption , provided the number of relays , @xmath2 , scales faster than @xmath7 , which is the minimum number of relays required to guarantee our achievability result .",
    "numerical evaluation also indicates that the ond protocol has higher sum - rates than those of other relaying methods under realistic network conditions ( e.g. , finite @xmath2 and snr ) since the inter - relay interference is significantly reduced owing to the opportunistic gain . for comparison , the ond scheme without alternate relaying and the max - min snr scheme are also shown as baseline schemes . note that our protocol basically operates with local channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter and thus is suitable for distributed / decentralized networks .",
    "our main contributions are fourfold as follows :    * in the @xmath0 channel with interfering relays , we introduce a new achievability scheme , termed ond with virtual full - duplex operation .",
    "* under the channel model , we completely analyze the optimal dof , the required relay scaling condition , and the decaying rate of the interference level , where the ond scheme is shown to approach the min - cut upper bound on the dof . * our achievability result ( i.e.",
    ", the derived dof and relay scaling law ) is validated via numerical evaluation .",
    "* we perform extensive computer simulations with other baseline schemes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we describe the system and channel models . in section  [ sec:3 ] , the proposed ond scheme is specified and its lower bound on the dof is analyzed .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] shows an upper bound on the dof .",
    "numerical results of the proposed ond scheme are provided in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
