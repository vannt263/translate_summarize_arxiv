    "aging is a key aspect of the dynamics in a host of complex glassy systems  @xcite .",
    "its main characteristics are a slow , sub - linear drift of macroscopic averages with the age @xmath0 of the system , i.e.  the time elapsed after an initial thermal quench , and a concomitant age dependence of the correlation and response functions .",
    "the latter shows that a quasi - stationary fluctuation regime for short observation times @xmath1 is followed by off - equilibrium dynamics for @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior can be attributed to an increasing degree of thermal stability of the dynamically relevant attractors or landscape valleys as the age @xmath0 grows  @xcite .    within each valley ,",
    "the pseudo - equilibrium fluctuations are determined by the free energy .",
    "however , the inter - valley non - equilibrium dynamics could be practically irreversible , and hence qualitatively different . adopting the simplified view that the selection is truly irreversible allows us to formulate a theoretical description of large non - equilibrium rearrangements , or ` quakes ' , which borrows from studies of non - thermal models  @xcite and which supplies a basis to the striking similarity of complex dynamics seen in very different systems with multiple metastable states .",
    "the key feature is dynamical invariance to shifts in the _ logarithm _ of time .",
    "this implies that the time spent in thermally metastable attractors is power - law distributed with an exponent @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the distribution has a @xmath4 aging behavior , often called full or pure aging .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 depends on the system size but not on the temperature .",
    "the further assumption that the memory of the initial configuration decays as @xmath5 with the number @xmath6 of quakes leads to a power - law decay and a @xmath4 form of the correlation function for @xmath7 . the corresponding non - equilibrium exponent @xmath8 is jointly determined by @xmath3 and @xmath9 .",
    "these theoretical results are checked through extensive numerical simulations of short ranged spin glass systems . while direct experimental evidence is not yet available , possibly related large - scale irreversible rearrangements similar to quakes",
    "have recently been identified in aging colloidal gels  @xcite .",
    "beyond its original macro - evolutionary context , the concept of ` punctuated equilibrium '  @xcite is applicable to any stochastic dynamics where long periods of stagnation are dotted by fast irreversible changes .",
    "this occurs e.g.  in micro - evolution  @xcite and in certain driven dissipative models  @xcite . within a population evolving in a fitness landscape  @xcite , fitness _ records",
    "_ achieved by an individual through random mutations are amplified to the macroscopic level by darwinistic selection and trigger punctuations .",
    "since the same statistics describes both punctuations and records , the analytical description available for the latter  @xcite can be applied to the former .",
    "below , we discuss how thermal noise may similarly induce large and irreversible quakes in glassy systems .    to summarize the basic ideas of record statistics  @xcite , consider times @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and independently draw for each integer time a random number from any fixed distribution not supported on a finite set .",
    "the attempts whose outcome exceeds all previous outcomes are marked as records . for large times , the probability that @xmath6 such events occur in @xmath12 $ ] is then @xmath13^k   \\left [ \\frac{t_w + t}{t_w } \\right]^{-\\alpha } , \\label{logpoisson}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 for a single sequence of attempts .",
    "the total number of records produced by @xmath15 independent sequences is a sum of log - poisson variables , and hence itself log - poisson distributed , with @xmath16 .",
    "equation  ( [ logpoisson ] ) can be recognized as a poisson distribution with @xmath17 replacing the linear difference @xmath18 between the time arguments , or , for short , a log - poisson distribution , but the generalization to the propagator @xmath19 is straightforward and completely analogous to the standard case . ] .",
    "equation  ( [ logpoisson ] ) implies that the rate of events decays as @xmath20 , while the logarithmic rate of events approaches the constant value @xmath3 for @xmath21 .",
    "glossing over the discreteness of the time arguments , we can now pick thermal noise as the ( arbitrary ) source of randomness producing the records .",
    "since landscape induced correlations are negligible if records are intercalated by long intervals spent dwelling near a local energy minimum , the number of energy records observed in a fixed time interval is expected to be proportional to a log - poisson variable  @xcite .",
    "the same applies if energies are measured relative to the current lowest energy minimum , producing the energy difference henceforth referred to as a ` barrier ' . with this definition ,",
    "not all barrier crossings carry physical significance . however ,",
    "if quakes are log - poisson distributed , they are naturally associated with the crossing of barriers of record magnitude .",
    "two special landscape features sketched in fig.[land_sketch ] would allow barrier records to induce quakes : i ) the stability of the attractors successively selected , as gauged by e.g. an exit barrier , must only increase marginally  @xcite , i.e.  in principle by an infinitesimal amount .",
    "this requires that shallow attractors be predominant , and implies that the actual magnitude of the records generating the quakes is immaterial .",
    "ii ) a large and negative energy change associated to a quake , ensures its irreversibility .",
    "such changes are observed in both atomistic glass models  @xcite and spin glasses  @xcite ,    the only adjustable quantities in this landscape cartoon are the parameter @xmath3 and the form of the quake induced decorrelation .",
    "the noise independence of the statistics restricts @xmath3 to be a temperature independent quantity .",
    "an interesting increase with system size can arise in spatially extended systems , where sufficiently distant regions can evolve independently .    in the sequel",
    ", we first deal with some theoretical consequences of the marginal stability of the attractors and irreversibility of the quakes . to make contact with experiments",
    ", we then summarize an empirical way to identify quakes in glassy systems  @xcite and apply it to spin glasses .",
    "the distribution of the residence or trapping time @xmath22 in valleys of an energy landscape has been considered theoretically  @xcite , but has not previously been measured .",
    "let @xmath23 mark the occurrence of the @xmath6th event in a log - poisson process with logarithmic rate @xmath3 . in perfect analogy to the usual poisson process , the ` log - waiting time ' @xmath24 has the exponential distribution @xmath25 which is mathematically equivalent to the event distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ logpoisson ] ) .",
    "we now consider the distribution of the residence time @xmath26 for traps entered at @xmath27 . as @xmath28 , we find @xmath29 which corresponds to full aging behavior . equation .",
    "( [ an_scaling ] ) with @xmath30 is plotted ( circles ) in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ residence_t ] , together with spin glass data ( lines ) .",
    "these are scaled in a slightly different manner , to account for a small but systematic deviation from full aging .    the power - law form of eq .",
    "( [ an_scaling ] ) was suggested by bouchaud  @xcite , with the added and crucial assumption of an infinite average residence time . in our case , the average residence time @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32 which is finite and @xmath33 for the observed @xmath34 . as a consistency check",
    ", we note that the largest relaxation time @xmath35 in a valley must be smaller than @xmath36 , for local equilibration to apply .",
    "when the latter is of order @xmath0 , @xmath37 follows . in the lack of special symmetries  @xcite , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 characterizes the short time decay of correlation functions , either as a cut - off parameter or directly as the time constant of an exponential decay .",
    "hence @xmath40 as expected .",
    "additional information on the effect of the quakes enters the calculation of thermally averaged correlations functions .",
    "let @xmath41 be the configurational overlap between the lowest energy configurations in valley @xmath42 and @xmath43 . with probability @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are the ` current ' attractors at times @xmath0 and @xmath45 , whence the _",
    "non_-equilibrium part of the configurational autocorrelation function is given by @xmath46    of special interest is @xmath47 , the average overlap between the first and the ( @xmath48th valley .",
    "this is the sole contribution to eq .",
    "( [ two - point ] ) for @xmath49 , in which case @xmath50 additionally describes the magnetization decay of the fully polarized configuration of a spin glass  @xcite .",
    "the exponential form @xmath51 anticipates the results in fig .",
    "[ correlation ] .",
    "an exponential decay means that each event induces the same relative change , and leads to @xmath52 where the non - equilibrium exponent @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 equation  ( [ expos ] ) thus links a dynamical exponent to the landscape geometry .",
    "the second approximate equality given in eq .",
    "( [ expos ] ) is only justified for @xmath55 .",
    "the further assumption that @xmath41 is altogether independent of @xmath42 amounts to translational invariance with respect to @xmath42 , and hence with respect to additive shifts in the logarithm of @xmath0 .",
    "these are equivalent to a multiplicative rescaling of @xmath0 .",
    "not surprisingly , eq .  ( [ two - point ] ) yields the scale invariant and full aging form @xmath56",
    "how should valleys and quakes be concretely defined given a time sequence of data ?",
    "one approach is the protocol developed  @xcite for numerical data describing isothermal relaxation after a deep quench .",
    "the basic observation is that at sufficiently low @xmath57 pseudo - equilibrium fluctuations repeatedly visit the same local energy minimum .",
    "hence , the attainment of an energy value lower than all previous values implies a non - equilibrium event , i.e.  an ongoing quake .",
    "several closely spaced minima records will often occur as a quake slides downhill among which the one preceding a barrier record is likely to be the most physically significant , as it  ideally  coincides with a new local minimum . by the same token , in a series of barrier records corresponding to an uphill climb ,",
    "the last record preceding a low energy record is most significant , as it marks the access to a new local minimum , and hence the start of a quake .",
    "the times at which the above types of event occur provide an empirical definition of both valleys and quakes .",
    "this procedure yields a null result if i ) only a single energy minimum is present ; or ii ) the initial condition is the ground state irrespective of the number of local minima present ; or iii ) all the minima and/or barriers are equal .",
    "also , iv ) if the trajectories can bypass the energy barriers and edge their way into states of lower energy through ` entropic barriers ' , the number of valleys discovered remains less or equal to one at all times .",
    "the actual outcome is very different , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ no_valleys ] , where the estimated average and variance of the number @xmath58 of valleys visited is plotted versus the logarithm of time .",
    "an equality between variance and average is a key feature of poisson distributions .",
    "if we neglect the initial curvature , the estimated quantities are very nearly proportional to @xmath59 , indicating that @xmath58 itself is proportional to a log - poisson variable through a constant of order one .",
    "we emphasize that log - poisson statistics is an idealized low @xmath57 description , and that systematic corrections in the form of a decaying logarithmic rate of events must be expected , since each valley has a growing probability to contain the true ground state .",
    "since @xmath3 is not truly constant , the single value required by the log - poisson theory can not be estimated accurately .",
    "as @xmath57 grows , local thermal equilibration within each attractor is not granted , and low energy records lose connection to landscape minima . a check of the energy and configurational changes associated with the quakes , of the sort performed in  @xcite is required to independently establish their physical relevance .",
    "we additionally checked that the low energy record configurations are close ( albeit usually not identical ) to actual valley minima .",
    "we performed extensive simulations of short - ranged ising spin glasses on cubic lattices ( @xmath60 spins ) with periodic boundary conditions and symmetric gaussian couplings with unit variance , see also  @xcite .",
    "the waiting time method  @xcite with single spin flip dynamics , which is dynamically equivalent to the metropolis algorithm but much faster at low @xmath57 , was used .",
    "the ` intrinsic ' and size independent time variable of this method corresponds to the number of monte carlo ( lattice ) sweeps in the metropolis as well as to the physical time of a real experiment . in all our runs , we skip the data within the first @xmath61 time units in order to let the system settle down from its random @xmath62 initial configuration .    the set of data shown in fig .",
    "[ no_valleys ] was obtained for a system of linear size @xmath63 at temperature @xmath64 .",
    "numerous similar plots ( not shown ) were obtained for temperatures in the range @xmath65 , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in most cases",
    "@xmath68 independent runs were performed for each value of @xmath57 and @xmath69 , removing any visible statistical flutter .",
    "when @xmath3 is calculated as the logarithmic slope of the number of valleys seen on average in the time window @xmath70 $ ] , its size dependence for @xmath71 and @xmath72 is found to be @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively . while the growth clearly tapers off , we can not with confidence conclude on the true asymptotic behavior for large @xmath69 .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath77 should remain finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "hence , the growth of @xmath3 must either remain bounded , or be compensated by a corresponding decrease of @xmath78 . to see that the latter is likely the case , we note that @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the hamming distance between the local minima at the bottom of consecutive ( @xmath81 ) valleys . in 3 d",
