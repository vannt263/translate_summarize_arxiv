    "phases of matter with broken continuous symmetries exhibit topological defects , which can be thermally excited or induced via external stresses . the surface interactions of a foreign inclusion within an ordered medium can induce nontrivial distortions in the bulk medium and lead to the nucleation of defect structures @xcite . even in cases where no defects are present , the distortions that arise can often be described by virtual defects within the foreign inclusion itself in much the same way that electric fields outside a conductor can be described by image charges within the conductor .",
    "two such experimental systems which have recently been studied are langmuir monolayers @xcite and nematic emulsions @xcite .    at sufficiently high density ,",
    "a langmuir monolayer forms an orientationally ordered liquid - condensed phase in which the order is characterized by a @xmath0 unit - vector order parameter , which we call the @xmath1-director @xcite . under appropriate conditions",
    "a liquid - condensed region can contain isolated domains of the rotationally isotropic liquid - expanded phase , that is , regions wherein the orientational order is absent . along the boundary separating the two phases",
    ", there is typically a preferred orientation of @xmath1 relative to the tangent vector to the boundary .",
    "the inclusions ( liquid - expanded regions ) can thus lead to a distortion of the order - parameter field of the ordered medium ( liquid - condensed region ) surrounding them .",
    "nematic emulsions are dispersions of droplets of nematic liquid crystal in an isotropic host @xcite",
    ". inverse nematic emulsions consist of surfactant coated spherical water droplets dispersed in a nematic host @xcite",
    ". the surfactant can be prepared such that the nematic director prefers to align either parallel or perpendicular to a surfactant coated surface .",
    "thus the droplets distort the local nematic field and , in the case of normal boundary conditions , the droplets themselves carry a topological hedgehog charge which must be compensated for by creating additional defect structures within the ordered medium .",
    "experimental observations @xcite in both langmuir monolayers and inverse nematic emulsions have been explained theoretically with some success @xcite . neither , however , is the simplest system one could imagine for the study of the effects of foreign inclusions in an ordered medium . in langmuir films the line tension of the interface between the two phases is so low that orientational order in the surrounding medium and the shape of the inclusion are strongly coupled , greatly complicating the theoretical treatment . in nematic emulsions , the elastic theory describing director distortions is highly non - linear , and as a result , it is very difficult to find exact solutions for the director around a droplet - defect pair . in this paper , we report observations of freely suspended inclusions in another ordered system , smectic - c films , and we develop a theory for their energetics .",
    "there are several types of circular inclusions with fixed boundary conditions that can be inserted into a freely suspended smectic - c film .",
    "the type we are concerned with here are islands , places where the film contains an integral number of additional smectic layers ( fig [ setup ] ) .",
    "islands can be introduced to a freely suspended film by ( 1 ) rapidly reducing the film area , ( 2 ) blowing across the film to pull material from the meniscus region or ( 3 ) heating the film near the smectic - to - isotropic or smectic - to - nematic phase transition , at which point isotropic or nematic droplets form in the film and remain as islands after cooling .",
    "typical islands have radii from 50 to several hundred microns .",
    "the boundaries of these inclusions are smectic dislocations , and the @xmath1 director has a preferred orientation relative to the tangent line to such dislocations @xcite thus providing our fixed boundary condition .",
    "this fixed boundary condition allows us to consider the interior and exterior regions of an island as separate systems , analogous to the way a conducting surface allows one to independently consider the electrostatic configurations interior and exterior to the conducting surface . while island - defect pairs are relatively easy to create and image ( fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) , they have the disadvantage that often the islands shrink , and it is difficult to control their size . this makes the creation of several islands of uniform size very difficult .",
    "a second type of inclusion in smectic - c films are isotropic or nematic droplets , found in materials that have a direct phase transition from the smectic - c to the isotropic phase .",
    "droplets have the disadvantage compared to islands that as one nears the isotropic transition , the birefringence of the film diminishes , and it becomes difficult to image the @xmath1-director .",
    "a third type of inclusion consists of the direct insertion of small ( 10 micron ) glass spheres into the film .",
    "while this in principle is the best technique , since size can be accurately controlled and the birefringence is unaffected , in practice it is difficult to maintain glass spheres larger than 5 microns in the film .",
    "larger spheres either rupture the film or simply pass through .",
    "regardless of its type , a circular inclusion with rigid boundary conditions along its perimeter carries a topological charge of @xmath2 .",
    "experimentally it is observed that each island nucleates a companion @xmath3 defect out of the bulk , which maintains a preferred separation from the inclusion while undergoing visible radial and azimuthal orientational fluctuations with respect to the center of the inclusion .    in this paper , we present a theoretical study of these circular inclusions in smectic - c films .",
    "we also report briefly on preliminary experimental observations that are in qualitative agreement with our theoretical analysis .",
    "the theoretical treatment of circular inclusions with rigid boundary conditions in smectic - c films is simpler than the treatment of similar defects in langmuir films and nematic emulsions since shape changes in the boundary present in langmuir films do not occur and within the one coupling constant model of smectic - c elasticity we avoid the nonlinearities inherent in the treatment of @xmath4 nematics .",
    "in fact , the equation describing the order is simply laplace s equation , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . because we impose rigid boundary conditions , our @xmath0 results are very similar to those obtained in @xmath4 nematic emulsions with similar boundary conditions .",
    "fluctuations , however , are more pronounced in @xmath0 than in @xmath4 .",
    "if the angle @xmath7 is constrained to make a constant angle @xmath8 with respect to the tangent to the boundary of an inclusion , then an inclusion necessarily creates ( or `` is '' ) a topological defect - a vortex , or equivalently , a disclination with positive topological charge .",
    "if the boundary conditions at infinity enforce alignment along a specific direction the total topological charge must be zero , and , as a consequence , a companion defect with negative charge must be created for every inclusion .",
    "the inclusion and its companion defect form a topological dipole that interacts with other distant inclusion - defect pairs via a @xmath0 dipole - dipole interaction .    in @xmath4 nematic emulsions , fluctuations in both the distance @xmath9 between a droplet and its companion defect and the angle @xmath10 between the droplet - defect dipole and the direction of the far - field alignment",
    "are negligible , with @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temperature , @xmath13 is a frank elastic constant and @xmath14 is the droplet radius ( @xmath15 m ) . since @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is approximately a molecular length (  @xmath18 nm ) we find that @xmath19    in our @xmath0 analog , the frank elastic constant @xmath20 has units of energy and is typically of order @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the film thickness . taking @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of layers in the film , we then find @xmath25 .",
    "our calculation actually leads to the numerically smaller result @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , logarithmic singularities in two - dimensions lead to a logarithmic dependence on the system size , @xmath27 , in @xmath28 .",
    "laplace s equation in two dimensions admits two fundamental types of point defects : a topological defect with @xmath29 and a logarithmic defect with @xmath30 . in what follows",
    ", we will refer to the charge of the topological defect as the topological charge or magnetic charge and that of the logarithmic defect as the electric charge since the angle field of the latter is equivalent to the potential produced by a point electric charge ( see appendix ) . to describe arbitrary orientations of the topological dipole with respect to the @xmath1-director at infinity ,",
    "both kinds of defects are needed .",
    "the `` charges '' of the topological defects are fixed to be integers whereas those of the logarithmic defects are proportional to the angular deviation of the dipole from its favored direction .    as in @xmath4",
    "nematic emulsions @xcite , widely separated inclusion - induced topological dipoles interact via a dipole - dipole potential arising from the arrangement of the magnetic charges associated with each inclusion . when the dipoles are not properly aligned with respect to the @xmath1-director at infinity",
    ", the inclusions will also carry a certain amount of electric charge , leading to an additional interaction . in three dimensions ,",
    "the analogous interaction is unimportant because of the prohibitive cost of deviations from the direction of preferred alignment . in two dimensions",
    ", deviations can be large : this interaction is important , and it can be calculated .",
    "it predicts that correlated rotations of dipoles in which the total electric charge is zero are energetically less costly than those with non - zero electric charge . it should be possible to test this prediction experimentally .",
    "our preliminary experimental observations are in qualitative agreement with these predictions . associated with each island",
    "is a companion negative defect ( fig .",
    "[ vfs_no_q ] ) .",
    "the position of this defect fluctuates visibly with angular fluctuations apparently greater than the radial fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , defect fluctuations appear to be correlated when more than one island is present .",
    "further study will be needed to provide unambiguous confirmation of these observations .",
    "our free standing smectic - c film is closely approximated by a @xmath0 @xmath31-model @xcite .",
    "a typical film has a small number of layers , @xmath32 , ( roughly 4 - 10 ) which can be determined exactly with laser reflectivity measurements .",
    "the projection of the nematic director into the plane of the film provides us with our unit - vector order parameter @xmath1 ( the tilt is relatively constant over the area of the film ) .",
    "the effective free energy of these films contains two elastic constants - one for splay distortions ( @xmath33 ) and another for bend ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 d^2x.\\ ] ] however , when the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath33 is small , the @xmath0 @xmath31-model provides an accurate approximation , @xmath36 d^2x \\\\   & = & \\frac{k}{2 } \\int_{\\omega } ( \\nabla \\phi)^2 d^2x , \\label{freeenergy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where it is understood that the integral is taken over the region @xmath37 where the order parameter @xmath1 exists and is nonzero .",
    "let us now examine an ideal case of a circular inclusion immersed in an ordered medium described by an @xmath31 order parameter @xmath38 .",
    "we take eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) to be our free energy , where @xmath13 is the frank elastic constant and the integral is to be taken over the region that the ordered medium occupies ( external to the inclusion and internal to some boundary farther away ) , namely @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a disc of radius @xmath41 centered about the origin , @xmath14 is the radius of the inclusion and @xmath27 is the system size .",
    "we do not include any surface energies since we will assume the properties of the surface will remain fixed ( i.e. , strong pinning boundary conditions keeping @xmath1 fixed and a very large line tension keeping the shape fixed ) .",
    "we will assume that the far field is uniform at the outer boundary taking @xmath42 .",
    "next we take the boundary condition at the surface to be of the form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the azimuthal angle relative to the center of the disc and @xmath8 is the angle that the director @xmath1 makes with the tangent vector to the boundary .",
    "this condition gives the inclusion a topological charge ( winding number ) of @xmath2 .",
    "the far - field boundary condition requires that the total charge be 0 , thus requiring the existence of an additional topological defect with charge @xmath3 .",
    "we will find that this defect will sit fairly close to the inclusion and that the pair will constitute a dipole , which can in turn interact with other such pairs via a dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we will note that the value of @xmath8 will only be relevant if one knows the actual direction of the far field , and then it will determine the relative angle between the far - field direction and the direction of the dipole .",
    "taking the radius of the defect to be @xmath45 and assigning a core energy to the defect @xmath46 @xcite , we simply need to find solutions for @xmath7 that depend on the position of the defect and to extract an effective free energy , @xmath47 $ ] , as a function of the defect position @xmath48 .",
    "minimization of eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) leads to laplace s equation , @xmath49 throughout @xmath37 except at points occupied by defects .",
    "the angle field of a single charge @xmath2 defect located at @xmath50 is simply @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "we note that @xmath53 satisfies laplace s equation everywhere except at @xmath54 .",
    "the angle field of a charge-@xmath55 defect at @xmath54 is @xmath56 .",

    ", we claim that it is good enough for @xmath27 significantly larger than @xmath14 . to satisfy both boundary conditions",
    "would require an infinite number of images inside @xmath14 and outside @xmath27 , but the additional images would have little effect on the energy as the interested reader may easily confirm",

    "next , noting that for any function @xmath169 we have @xmath170 we can define @xmath171 and note that @xmath172 interestingly , the vector potential for a line of magnetic charges parallel to the @xmath163axis piercing the @xmath167plane at @xmath165 is simply @xmath173 which corresponds precisely to the singularities in @xmath174 .",
    "equivalently we can view this as a magnetic charge in @xmath0 , just as we viewed the electrostatic line charge as a charge in @xmath0 electrostatics .",
    "now , making the final identification , @xmath175 we can write @xmath176 which looks just like the energy density for electromagnetism . furthermore , we can define electric and magnetic charge densities @xmath177 and then complete the electromagnetic analogy by writing @xmath178 this is why we have chosen to call the logarithmic singularities `` electric charges '' and the @xmath179 singularities `` magnetic charges '' .",
    "of course , in this analogy we have no reason to expect the lines of magnetic charge to be quantized , whereas in the original problem there is a clear explanation as to why the @xmath179 singularities are quantized ( the requirement that the physical field @xmath7 be single - valued ) .",
    "alternatively we could have exploited the fact that @xmath180 treated the @xmath179 singularities as a separate species of logarithmic singularities and viewed our free energy as being the sum of two distinct non - interacting electrostatic energies .",

    "as mentioned in the paper , the rigid boundary conditions along the dislocation separating the bulk from the interior of the island allows us to consider the regions independently .",
