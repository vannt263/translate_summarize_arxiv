    "recurrent novae are one of subclasses of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) which are binary systems containing a white dwarf as an accretor and a mass - donor star filling its roche lobe .",
    "non - magnetic cvs are generally classified into novae , novalike variables , and dwarf novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "novae are cvs showing outbursts due to thermonuclear runaway on the surface of the accreting white dwarf , and are classified into two types of classical novae and recurrent novae .",
    "the former are novae with single outburst detections , and a multiple record of outbursts gives a nova the latter classification . at present about 300 novae comprising about 30  % of cvs are classified @xcite , and only ten recurrent novae are known in them .",
    "differences between classical novae and recurrent novae principally result from a significant difference in mass of the accretor .",

    "such a condition produces frequent nova - explosions for recurrent novae occurring in shorter recurrence intervals of 10100  yr compared with those for classical novae ( @xmath0  yr ) .",
    "a recurrent nova generally shows a faster decline from its outburst , which mainly depends on a mass of the accretor and its envelope - mass at an eruption .",
    "in contrast , white dwarfs in classical novae are believed to have moderate masses and accumulate hydrogen - rich matter much slower than in recurrent novae . as a result ,",
    "a part of the hydrogen diffuses into a white dwarf of a classical nova before an ignition so that a surface layer of the white dwarf is highly dredged up into the hydrogen - rich envelope and blown off in the outburst - wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with spectra of ejecta observed in outbursts of classical novae which show heavy elements such as carbon , oxygen , and neon , and thus outbursts of a classical nova provide a gradual erosion for the white dwarf . on the other hand",
    ", ejecta observed in outbursts of recurrent novae are not enriched by such metals , i.e. , massive white dwarfs in those systems are not eroded .",
    "hence , in recurrent novae , the white dwarfs likely increase mass toward the chandrasekhar limit and are possibly fated to be type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "the recurrent nova ciaql was originally recorded as a possible nova in 1917 @xcite .",
    "lack of detailed information in that event had unfortunately left the nature of the object unsettled for a long time .",
    "the object is a peculiar eclipsing binary system showing 0.6  mag depth of primary eclipse with an orbital period of 0.618355  d @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum in quiescence shows higher - excited emission - features of heii and ciii  niii complex on a reddened continuum , while all balmer lines are detected as absorption lines @xcite .",
    "such absorption features generally imply non - cv nature , and the original suspected - cv classification @xcite had almost been disregarded .",

    "it is noted that the data on february 16 , march 9 , and april 30 of 2001 are excluded from table  [ tab : log_phot ] , because they were already presented in @xcite .",
    "the light curve indicates that the object kept a gradual decline of about @xmath8  d ( plateau phase ) since a sudden fading and recovery observed in late november of 2000 ( around jd 2451870 ) after which the object became systematically about 0.5  mag fainter . on 2001",
    "may 16 , the object was observed to be somewhat fainter in the gradual decline , which was very likely due to a primary eclipse of the binary system ( table  [ tab : log_phot ] ) .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the object in the previous quiescence .",
    "this estimation is in agreement with an independent record made by the roboscope between 19951996 which shows a @xmath1116.116.7 orbital variation with typical accuracy of about 0.1  mag ( k.  honeycutt , private communication - magnitudes in 19911995 presented in fig .",
    "1 of @xcite is insecure due to an unknown zero - point in their photometric calibration . ] ) .",
    "thus , in the quiescence it is expected that ciaql is @xmath12 and @xmath13  mag at outside and minimum of a primary eclipse , respectively , with an assumptively constant @xmath10 obtained at outside of an eclipse .",
    "the validity of that quiescent level is also supported by identifications for the object in records of poss  ii ( gsc2  s300213319926 : @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and usno ( usno  0825.13277160 : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_all ] , the object was significantly brighter than the quiescent level in 2001 .",
    "the observation on 2001 october 11 indicates that the object was about 15.44  mag which was comparable to the quiescent level .",
    "the orbital phase of the binary system was 0.00.01 at the observation , i.e. , the timing corresponded to a minimum of the primary eclipse .",
    "hence , assuming a 0.50.6  mag depth of the primary eclipse , the brightness observed on october 11 was consistent with the declining trendline , and we can conclude that ciaql had still not reached to quiescence at around jd 2452200 .",
    "the next data - point on 2001 december 4 again demonstrates the same state of the object : the object was brighter than the quiescent level while the orbital phase of the object was 0.110.12 , i.e. , in the middle of the egress .",
    "in the observation on 2002 april 5 , however , we found that the object was 15.92  mag which was not only considerably fainter than in 2001 but also @xmath18  mag fainter as compared with the expected quiescent level .",
    "the orbital phase was 0.110.12 at the observation , and a magnitude expected for outside of the primary eclipse on that occasion is well consistent with the quiescent level .",
    "thus , we conclude that ciaql was not in quiescence at least prior to 2001 december 4 , and reached the quiescence prior to 2002 april 5 , after the plateau phase which continued for an acceptable range of 510630  d. this result is well consistent with the result given in @xcite , and our observations on 2002 june 14 , august 26 , and october 9 confirm the conclusion .",
    "most recurrent novae except tpyx had been known as very fast novae which decline with @xmath19  d and completely fade to quiescence within several months in nova - outbursts .",
    "tpyx is an exceptional recurrent nova with the shortest orbital period of 1.8  h @xcite , and it probably consists a dwarf companion as the mass donor . the rest of recurrent novae are divided into two subclasses of the rsoph - type and usco - type which probably contain a red giant and a slightly evolved main - sequence star as mass donors , respectively @xcite .",
    "ciaql apparently belongs to the latter based on the orbital period , and the extremely long decline of @xmath20  d makes the object a peculiar member of the subclass @xcite .",
    "such a slower decline suggests a smaller mass of the white dwarf of ciaql compared with those of other recurrent novae .",
    "this nature is also supported by the long duration of the plateau phase and the longest recurrence interval of 83  yr in recurrent novae .",
    "similar characteristics have been found in a recurrent nova imnor in the 2002 outburst : a slow decline of @xmath21  d and a recurrence interval of 82  yr are comparable to those of ciaql of the object is possibly larger than the value described above ( see fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "all recurrence intervals in recurrent novae except ciaql and imnor are a few decades , which makes those novae easier to be detected as recurrent objects , and therefore most of them are suspected to contain extremely massive white dwarfs near the chandrasekhar limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "outbursts of classical novae are observed at only once for each , since intervals of @xmath0  yr for outbursts are enough longer than the human history .",
    "hence ciaql is probably the recurrent nova closest to classical novae we have known .",
    "the recorded amplitude of the 2000 outburst of ciaql is approximately 7.5  mag as depicted in the light curve , assuming that the maximum occurred on 2000 may 1 .",
    "this amplitude is reasonable for an outburst of a recurrent nova ( @xmath22811  mag ) , and is significantly smaller than that of a classical nova ( typically 914  mag ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the firm occasion of the maximum is possibly uncertain , i.e. , a brighter maximum which had occurred between 2000 april 11 and 30 is still possible . in recurrent novae",
    "a dispersion of about 3  mag is seen in the distribution of amplitudes of outbursts , which can be interpreted as an effect of a correlation between absolute magnitudes and inclination angles for novae @xcite .",
    "larger outbursts with amplitudes of @xmath2310  mag are observed in v394cra , imnor , usco , and v745sco , and these objects are known or suspected as binary systems with higher inclination angles in recurrent novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the orbital light curve of ciaql showing deep eclipses strongly suggests a higher inclination angle , which permits a possibility of an about 3  mag brighter maximum for the 2000 outburst of ciaql ; otherwise the object is a recurrent nova with an exceptionally smaller amplitude of an outburst .",
    "if the maximum indeed occurred at about the middle of 2000 april and if the 1917 outburst had been missed , the 2000 outburst of ciaql might have been indistinguishable from a typical outburst of a classical nova .    in conclusion , these characteristics of ciaql observed in the 2000 outburst indicate that this object is a recurrent nova having resemblances to classical novae in many aspects .",
    "we have found a recurrent nova showing a significantly slower evolution of an outburst which is likely attributed to a smaller mass of the white dwarf .",
    "ciaql is a very suggestive system of the first case of an intermediate between classical novae and recurrent novae .",
    "the 2000 outburst of ciaql was theoretically modeled in @xcite by means of light curve analyses .",
    "although the calculations well reproduced the observed light curve in the early part of the outburst prior to the plateau phase , the reproduction of the later phase suffered from an uncertainty in the duration of the plateau phase .",
    "a principal discrepancy is that the observed duration of the plateau phase is evidently longer than the expectations .",
    "the light curves for the early parts of the outbursts in 1917 and 2000 , providing decline - rates of the fadings from the eruptions @xcite , seem to tightly constrain a mass of the white dwarf to approximately @xmath24 .",
    "this is especially clear in the 1917 outburst which was reproduced with a hydrogen content of @xmath25 @xcite . as for the latter part of the 2000 outburst ,",
    "the solution with @xmath26 is apparently suitable for the observed duration of the plateau phase .",
    "hence a preferable situation is likely such a higher hydrogen content in the white - dwarf envelope of ciaql . in this case",
    ", a major problem should be solved is a discrepancy on the occasion of the wind - stop which was observed in late november of 2001 as a drop and prompt recovery of the brightness .",
    "that sudden event is the most significant decline seen in the plateau phase and is therefore plausibly attributed to the wind - stop , which is the reason why helium - enriched cases for the white - dwarf envelope were considered in @xcite , and no other explanation for the event has been proposed at present .    in the plateau phase , the object was predicted to exhibit a supersoft x - ray emissivity as a consequence of hydrogen burning on the surface of the white dwarf @xcite . in the 1999 outburst of a recurrent nova usco ,",
    "supersoft x - ray was detected from that object in the plateau phase @xcite .",
    "the supersoft x - ray phase had been predicted by a theoretical model of hydrogen - burning surfaces of white dwarfs for recurrent novae @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a photometric evolution of the 1999 outburst , and an orbital - period change from which the mass - transfer rate during the previous quiescence between 1987 and 1999 was observationally estimated was detected in the light curve .",
    "these observations of usco were successfully explained by a consistent model based on the scheme for recurrent novae @xcite , and the physical parameters led usco to the most probable candidate of a progenitor system of a type ia supernova .",
    "the expected mass of the white dwarf of ciaql is a reasonable value for a supersoft x - ray source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though a definite detection of supersoft x - ray has not been reported in the 2000 outburst . such softer x - ray may be difficult to be detected if it exists , because of the higher interstellar reddening on the line of sight toward the object which is demonstrated by several optical observations @xcite .",
    "the prediction for the supersoft x - ray phase is also supported by a similarity in the shape of the orbital modulation during the plateau phase compared with shapes observed in orbital light curves of known supersoft x - ray sources with higher inclination angles @xcite .    at the end of the plateau phase",
    ", a termination of the hydrogen burning should involve a final fading after which the outburst completely ended . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_all ] we can see that no significant change of the plateau state was observed , implying that the hydrogen burning likely continued at least until the beginning of 2002 .",
    "as described above , if the occasion of the wind - stop is fixed , a longer duration of the supersoft x - ray phase is required to interpret the observed epoch for the end of the outburst .",
    "other discrepancies between the observation and calculation are the brightness and decline - rate of the object in the plateau phase .",
    "the former was inevitably caused by lack of secure observation published to be compared with calculations , as described in the footnote of section  3 , i.e. , the reproduced brightness of the object is brighter than the observation in the plateau phase ( e.g. , the multi - color magnitudes on 2001 march 15 provide the differences ) . the decline - rate observed in the plateau phase was about 1  mag@xmath27  d. in contrast ,",
    "the gradient of the reproduced light curve is too flat to fit the observed light curve for the case of @xmath25 which is suitable to explain the duration of the plateau phase .",
    "a revised model in @xcite showed a better agreement for the decline - rate , but it requires a termination of the hydrogen burning to reduce the brightness , which necessarily shortens the duration of the plateau phase in contradiction with the observation .    in conclusion",
    ", the duration of the plateau phase of the 2000 outburst suggests a higher hydrogen content of the white - dwarf envelope for ciaql based on the current model of recurrent novae .",
    "however , the detailed behaviour observed in the later phase of the present outburst is inconsistent with the published models , which requires drastic modification of the present model .",
