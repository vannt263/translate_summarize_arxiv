    "the unprecedented development of laser technologies in recent two decades , mainly due to chirped pulse amplification technique @xcite , has allowed increase of intensity of laser sources in the first stage a six orders of magnitude @xcite reaching the relativistic intensities @xmath0@xmath1 in the infrared and optical domains , respectively , then exceeding these values up to @xmath2 for current superpower laser beams of ultrarelativistic intensities @xcite . in many laboratories",
    "@xcite compact lasers can deliver @xmath3 petawatt short pulses , with focused intensities as high as @xmath4 .",
    "next generation multipetawatt and exawatt optical laser systems @xcite will be capable to deliver ultrahigh intensities exceeding @xmath5 , which are well above the ultrarelativistic regime of electron - laser interaction . at such intensities",
    "the radiation - matter interaction enters the phase of ultrafast dynamics in supershort time scales , with formation of such important fields in condensed - matter - physics that the attoscience at1,at2,atto1,atto2,atto3,atto4 , and relativistic optics mourou , rel - rep2,br .- kr.,rel - rep1,pukh are .",
    "the appearance of laser sources with ultrarelativistic intensities has opened real possibilities for revelation of many nonlinear electrodynamic phenomena at the interaction of superpower radiation fields with high brightness accelerator beams @xcite , relativistic plasma targets of solid densities @xcite , and qed vacuum @xcite.laser sources of such enormous intensities predetermine , in particular , the future of laser accelerators @xcite of superperhigh energies , including laser - plasma accelerators @xcite .",
    "thus , currently available optical lasers provide @xmath6 up to @xmath7 , meanwhile with the next generation of laser systems one can manipulate with beams at @xmath8 @xmath9 . in such ultrastrong laser fields , electrons can reach to ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "however to obtain ultrarelativistic net energies for field - free electrons we need the third body for satisfaction of conservation laws for energy - momentum of a free electron ( after the interaction ) with absorption / radiation of photons in the field of a plane monochromatic wave @xcite , or take advantage of nonplane character of tightly focused supershort laser pulses @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the actual way to get net energy exchange of relativistic electrons is using of coherent processes of laser - particle interaction with the additional resonances . among those the induced cherenkov , compton , and undulator processes are especially of interest @xcite .",
    "these are coherent induced processes where a critical intensity of stimulated wave exists ( because of coherent character of corresponding spontaneous process ) above which the induced process proceeds only in one direction - coherent radiation ( wave amplification ) , or absorption ( particle acceleration ) depending on the particle initial velocity with respect to resonance value ( satisfying the condition of coherency ) of each process .",
    "the latter is the most important feature of nonlinear resonance inherent in these processes to get high net energy change of particles , specifically for laser acceleration @xcite , or free electron laser ( fel ) @xcite , as well as to generate relativistic electron beams of low energy spreads and emittances due to the threshold nature of nonlinear resonance in these induced coherent processes .    in principle",
    ", the realization of acceleration or inverse problem of fel in any laser - induced process requires the possible largest coherent length of particle - laser stimulated interaction at which the accumulation of particle energy in the acceleration regime , or coherent radiation -in the wave amplification regime take place on the whole coherent length of certain process .",
    "in other cases , the existence of an additional resonance ( e.g. , in a static magnetic field @xcite ) is necessary where the particle - wave interaction cross section enhances by many orders in magnitude .",
    "these are the linear resonances well enough investigated during the past decades . here",
    "we will consider laser - induced processes on free electrons with the large effective gain of interaction due to nonlinear resonance achieved in the given field of a strong laser radiation . in the induced cherenkov ,",
    "compton , and undulator processes such resonance is adequate to fulfilment of condition of coherency between the particle and wave achieved in the field at the aforementioned critical intensity of the total wave - field . in the result of such interaction , at the laser intensities larger than critical value a nonlinear threshold phenomenon of particles reflection  or capture take place -accelerating or decelerating electrons on the shortest interaction lengths , even shorter than a laser wavelength @xcite .",
    "in contrast to induced cherenkov process @xcite where the intensities of applied laser fields are confined by ionization threshold of dielectric media @xcite in vacuum processes  in the induced compton @xcite and undulator @xcite ones there is no restriction on the electromagnetic ( em ) field strengths that allows to apply current superpower laser beams of ultrarelativistic intensities mourou for acceleration of particles up to superhigh energies .",
    "the other practical difference between these induced processes is in the relativistic character of initial resonance width of particles to reach the threshold value of corresponding nonlinear resonance in the field for reflection / capture phenomenon .",
    "thus , in contrast to cherenkov and undulator processes where  practically initial relativistic / ultrarelativistic particles are needed for realization of nonlinear cherenkov resonance in gaseous media @xcite , or nonlinear resonance in a magnetic undulator with the step of the order of a few @xmath10 @xcite , induced compton mechanism for particles reflection / capture and , consequently , acceleration regime practically may be realized for arbitrary initial energies of the particles @xcite . in particular , using laser pulses of near frequencies one can accelerate initially nonrelativistic beams , or even particles in rest .",
    "second , at the same frequencies of counterpropagating laser pulses in the induced compton process one can achieve the cancellation of particles transverse momenta acquired in the field to obtain quasi - colinear particles bunches from the emerging relativistic electron targets ( elimination of a bunch angular divergence ) , as it has been proposed in the paper @xcite for generation of uniform relativistic electron layers at the coherent compton backscattering on the ultra - thin solid foils ( see , also , @xcite ) .    a promising way for achieving of laser - driven electron acceleration is the use of a plasma medium @xcite .",
    "however , the laser - plasma accelerator schemes face problems connected with the inherent instabilities in laser - plasma interaction processes . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum of direct acceleration mechanisms of charged particles by a single laser pulse is very restricted , since one should use the laser beams focused to subwavelength waist radii , or use subcycle laser pulses , or use radially polarized lasers , violating the plane character of a coherent laser pulse for particles acceleration by a single wave - pulse in vacuum without the third body .",
    "all these scenarios with different field configurations have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in the works 22_exp , a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10,a11,a12,a13,a14,a15,a16,a17 .",
    "note that beside the focusing of a laser pulse to subwavelength waist radii we can get nonplane laser beam by terminating the field , either by reflection , absorption , or diffraction @xcite . the proof of principle experiment of this type has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "it is used initially relativistic electron beam and a moderately strong laser pulse . to obtain dense enough electron bunches it is reasonable to consider electrons acceleration from nanoscale - solid plasma - targets meyer - ter - vehn , mirror1,mirror2,mirror3 at intensities high enough to separate all electrons from ions @xcite .",
    "thus , combining these two schemes one can obtain ultrarelativistic solid density electron bunches 11b,12b,13b,14b,15b,16b,17b,18b .",
    "such bunches can be used to obtain high - flux of positrons , @xmath11-quanta @xcite with possible applications in material science , medicine , and nuclear physics .",
    "the recent achievements in the laser technology related to implementation of supershort  femtosecond laser sources and subsycle pulses of relativistic intensities exceeding the intra - atomic fields open real opportunities for realization of laser - plasma accelerators of ultrahigh energies mey .- ter,1p,2p,3p,4p,5p,6p,7p,8p .",
    "these schemes are based on the laser - plasma - wake - field and laser - beat - wave mechanisms of laser - assisted acceleration in plasma .",
    "the interaction of such powerful radiation fields with the plasma has led to generation of quasi - monoenergetic relativistic electron beams in laser - driven plasma accelerators a9,a10,a11,a12,a13,a14,a15,a16,a17 . concerning the interaction of ultrashort laser pulses of relativistic intensities with the free electrons in vacuum , i.e. the implementation of laser accelerators",
    ", one should note that experiments in this area are gathering power at present .",
    "one of the first laser accelerator concepts is the inverse cherenkov accelerator ( ica ) .",
    "the ica scheme has been investigated since the advent of lasers [ see , for example , @xcite ] .",
    "the appearance of powerful laser sources already in the next decade after the first lasers has stimulated comprehensive theoretical @xcite and experimental p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,kim1,kim2,kim3,kim4 investigations towards the implementation of both induced cherenkov problems ica and cherenkov laser realization in diverse schemes of multiphoton interaction that makes a phase velocity matching of em wave with a particle by controlling the refraction index of gaseous medium so as to be a wave phase velocity in a dielectric medium less than light speed in vacuum .",
    "various interaction schemes of electrons with stimulating radiation have been considered as with ultrarelativistic electron beams in a gaseous medium for the optical region @xcite , as well as with mildly relativistic beams in dielectric waveguides for the microwave region w1,w2,w3,w4,w5,w6,w7,w8,w9,unmag . in the latter case , the electron beam passes over the dielectric in the vacuum surface cherenkov process that enables one to avoid the impeding factors of the medium ( the multiple scattering of electrons on atoms , the ionization losses in the medium etc . ) .",
    "besides , the usage of solid - state dielectric as a slow - wave structure ( with rather high dielectric constant @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) enables the achievement of electron - wave synchronism by mildly or moderately relativistic electron beams .",
    "it is important to note that the effect of critical field exists even in a very week wave field if the interaction occurs in the region close to the initial cherenkov resonance .",
    "therefore one can not escape these peculiarities restricting only the intensity of the external wave field and solve the problem in the scope of the linear theory even for very week wave fields @xcite .",
    "note that regarding the induced cherenkov process a series of systematical wrong works have been made during the last two decades of past century , which were discussed in special review @xcite devoted to consideration of those results . in the mentioned review the all principal mistakes",
    "have been shown in detail , therefore in the current review article we will not repeat the analysis of those papers which reader can get in the review @xcite . the particle reflection  phenomenon from a slowed plane wave pulse has been applied also for cases where the group velocity of a wave pulse due to the dispersion can be less than light speed in vacuum @xcite : in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a plasma , in ref .",
    "@xcite at the focusing of an ultrashort laser pulse in vacuum , in the so - called by authors dispersion - dominated propagation regime .",
    "nonlinear resonance of threshold nature requiring shortest acceleration length also takes place at the charged particle interaction with strong laser radiation _ _  _ _ and static magnetic field along the wave propagation direction _ _  _ _ ( when the resonant effect of the wave on the particle rotational motion in the uniform magnetic field is possible ) in a medium @xcite . in vacuum , as a result of the interaction of a charged particle with a monochromatic em wave and uniform magnetic field the resonance created at the initial moment for the free - particle velocity automatically holds throughout the whole interaction process due to the equal doppler shifts of the larmor and wave frequencies in the field .",
    "this phenomenon is known as autoresonance   @xcite .",
    "_ _  _ _ this property of cyclotron resonance in vacuum makes possible as particles acceleration @xcite , as well as the creation of a generator of coherent microwave radiation / radioemission by an electron beam , namely , a cyclotron resonance maser ( crm ) ginz1,ginz2,mcn , coo , nus , ai1,ai2,brat .    from the point of view of quantum theory the relativistic nonequidistant landau levels of the particle in the wave field become equidistant in the autoresonance with",
    "the quantum recoil at the absorption / emission of photons by the particle . _",
    "_  _ _ in addition , the dynamic stark effect of the wave electric field on the transversal bound states of the particle does not violate the equidistance of landau levels in the autoresonance .",
    "_ _ then the inverse process , that is , multiphoton resonant excitation of landau levels by strong em wave and , consequently , the particle acceleration in vacuum due to cyclotron resonance , in principle , is possible",
    ". _  _    in a medium with arbitrary refraction properties ( dielectric or plasma ) because of the different doppler shifts of the larmor and wave frequencies in the interaction process the autoresonance is violated .",
    "however , the threshold ( by the wave intensity ) phenomenon of electron hysteresis in a medium due to the nonlinear cyclotron resonance in the field of strong monochromatic em wave takes place @xcite ( this process has been treated in the earlier paper @xcite , where , however , only an oscillating solution has been obtained ) . _",
    "_ _ in contrast to autoresonance , the nonlinear cyclotron resonance in a medium proceeds with a large enough resonant width .",
    "_  _ _ this so - called phenomenon of electron hysteresis leads to significant acceleration of particles , especially in the plasmalike media where the superstrong laser fields of ultrarelativistic intensities can be applied @xcite .",
    "note that the use of dielectriclike ( gaseous ) media in this process makes it possible to realize cyclotron resonance in the optical domain ( with laser radiation ) due to the possibility of arbitrarily small doppler shift of a wave frequency close to the cherenkov cone , in contrast to the vacuum case where the  cyclotron resonance for the existing maximal powerful static magnetic fields is possible only in the microwave domain @xcite .",
    "the particle reflection  phenomenon has a significant property : at the above - threshold interaction the induced process occurs only in one direction  either direct ( laser scheme ) or inverse ( accelerator scheme ) @xcite meanwhile at the below - threshold interaction the both direct and inverse processes take place simultaneously that reduces in general the net gain for each problem .",
    "therefore this phenomenon gives in principal new opportunity for implementation of nonlinear schemes of fel or laser accelerators in the induced coherent processes at the above - threshold interaction regime .",
    "due to this feature the reflection  phenomenon may also be used for the monochromatization of particle beams @xcite . on the other hand , because of reflection  phenomenon the nonlinear compton effect in media with @xmath14 can proceed only at the wave@xmath15intensities below the critical one @xcite .    for the nonplane em wave pulses of small space sizes ( tightly focused ) and of short duration , such as current superpower laser pulses are , it is impossible to solve the problem analytically .",
    "hence , in the papers last , wigler,2_beams the reflectionand capture phenomena in case of actual nonplane - short laser pulses has been investigated by numerical integration of relativistic equations of motion .",
    "the phenomenon of particle reflectionand capture by em wave being of pure classical nature , nevertheless leads to quantum effects of probability density modulation of a free particle state on the hard x - ray frequencies because of interference of incident and reflected ( inelastic ) de broglie waves after the reflection from a wave barrier @xcite and of zone structure of particle states in the wave potential well capture regime like the particle states in a crystal lattice @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is evident that the role of particle spin in this process _ _  _ _ is important since in dielectriclike media the wave periodic em field in the intrinsic frame of reference becomes a static magnetic field and spin interaction _ _  _ _ with such a field should resemble the zeeman effect . besides",
    ", the critical intensity depends on the particle spin projection and , consequently , it is differ for different initial spin orientations .",
    "choosing the certain value for critical intensity corresponding to the certain spin orientation of particles in the beam , with the appropriate laser intensity ( above this critical value ) one can achieve the particle beam polarization.these are the quantum effects in the above critical regime of induced cherenkov process . below the critical intensity the coherent effects of particles classical bunching on optical and shorter wavelengths @xcite , quantum effects of modulation of particle probability density on the wave harmonics mod , mod.2,mod.3 , and inelastic diffraction scattering of the particles on the traveling em wave in a dielectric medium takes place dif.2,dif.3,dif.4 like the kapitza ",
    "dirac effect on a standing wave lattice @xcite or bragg diffraction on a crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "the interest to kapitza ",
    "dirac effect @xcite has been increased especially after the successful realization of experiment with high - intensity and strongly coherent laser beams - gratings @xcite .",
    "it follows to note that observation of diffraction effect during the next 70 years after its prediction had not been succeeded .",
    "for the acquaintance with the experimental situation in this area since the advent of this effect , or for detailed references on earlier work we refer the reader to review papers @xcite .",
    "the significance of kapitza  dirac effect , apart from its quantum - mechanical meaning as a best example of demonstration of electron matter wave diffracted by light and , moreover , as an unique sample of a diffraction system with reversed properties of the matter and light , is also conditioned by important applications , since electron beams difracted from highly coherent laser gratings are coherent with each other .",
    "hence , the kapitza ",
    "dirac effect is a very convenient , even maybe an irreplaceable means to realize coherent electron beams .",
    "such beams can serve as a basis for construction of new important tools of diverse species , e.g. , coherent beam splitters , new type electron interferometers which would operate at rather low electron energies ( typical for existing now in atomic physics ) etc .",
    "kapitza  dirac effect on standing wave lattice is a particular case of the induced compton process in the field of two counterpropagating em  waves of the same frequencies at which electron moves in perpendicular direction to wavevectors of counterpropagating waves ( classical condition of resonance ) , to exclude the doppler shifting of waves frequencies because of longitudinal component of electron velocity . at the quantum condition of resonance -taking into account",
    "the quantum recoil as well- the exact condition of resonance is satisfied at the small angle to perpendicular direction that corresponds to elastic bragg diffraction on the phase lattice of a standing wave .",
    "nevertheless , the phase matching between the electrons and counterpropagating waves in the induced compton process can also be fulfilled in general case of bichromatic em waves of different frequencies if electron moves at the certain angle with respect to wavevectors of counterpropagating waves at which the condition of coherency between the electron and waves of different frequencies is satisfied dif.2 .",
    "however , in contrast to kapitza ",
    "dirac effect , diffraction of electrons in this case is inelastic .",
    "thus , due to the induced compton effect in the two wave fields an electron absorbs @xmath16 photons from the one wave and coherently radiates @xmath16 photons into the other wave of different frequency and vice versa .",
    "this is the condition of coherency in the induced compton process corresponding to the resonance between the doppler - shifted frequencies in the intrinsic frame of reference of an electron in the bichromatic counterpropagating waves at which the conservation of the number of photons in the induced compton process takes place fed.,dif.2,fed.mci ( see , also the paper @xcite where theoretical analysis of the scattering of electrons by a strong standing wave with a slowly varying amplitude has been made ) , in contrast to spontaneous compton effect in the strong wave field where after the multiphoton absorption a single photon is emitted @xcite    so , the scope of the kapitza ",
    "dirac effect has been extended since 1975 in the works @xcite for inelastic diffraction scattering of electrons on strong travelling wave in the induced compton , cherenkov , and undulator / wiggler processes , taking into account the the mentioned peculiarity in these processes .",
    "note that the term `` strong wave '' here is relative , since the mentioned nonlinear resonance takes place even in the very weak wave - fields if the electrons initially are close to the resonance state , i.e. the electrons initial longitudinal velocity is close to the phase velocity of the slowed wave , at which the critical field is also very small and , respectively , very low wave intensities may be above critical @xcite . at this background , the paper @xcite is completely misunderstanding where authors , citing the papers @xcite but bypassing the existence of critical field with aforementioned peculiarity , they obtain the same formula of the paper @xcite for multiphoton probability of diffraction scattering on the travelling wave in a dielectric medium ( by other way -on the base of the helmholtz ",
