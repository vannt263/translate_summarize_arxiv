    "the radio emission of core - dominated , radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is synchrotron radiation generated in the relativistic jets that emerge from the nucleus of the galaxy , presumably along the rotational axis of a central supermassive black hole .",
    "one important source of information about the physical conditions in the radio - emitting regions is the distribution of the spectral index @xmath0 over the source ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the source flux at frequency @xmath3 ) .",
    "the core region is typically observed to be at least partially optically thick , with a nearly flat or inverted spectrum , while the jets are optically thin , with negative spectral indices .",
    "the spectrum may also flatten in regions of the jet in which there is re - acceleration of electrons or low - frequency absorption ( e.g. gabuzda , pushkarev & garnich 2000 ; gabuzda , gmez & agudo 2001 ) .",
    "synchrotron radiation can be highly linearly polarised , to @xmath4 in the case of a uniform magnetic field ( pacholczyk 1970 ) , and linear polarisation observations can yield unique information about the orientation and degree of order of the magnetic field in the synchrotron source , as well as the distribution of thermal electrons and the magnetic - field geometry in the immediate vicinity of the agn ( e.g. , via faraday rotation of the plane of polarisation ) .",
    "the compact radio emission of such agn can be probed with high resolution using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) .",
    "the radio telescopes in the interferometric array can be separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres , making it infeasible to physically link ( synchronise ) them electronically , and high - accuracy timing signals must be recorded together with the data , so that the signals obtained at different antennas can be accurately synchronised during correlation . in practice , the amplitudes and , especially , phases of the measured complex visibility data unavoidably contain unknown errors , which can conveniently be expressed via antenna - based complex gain factors : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the observed and true visibility functions on the baseline between antennas @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the complex gain factors for antennas @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the complex gains @xmath12 must be determined and removed from the data in order to achieve the highest - quality images possible for the radio - telescope array used .",
    "this is normally done iteratively , via alternate application of self - calibration ( fort and yee 1976 , cotton 1979 , readhead & wilkinson 1978 , readhead et al .",
    "1980 , cornwell & wilkinson 1981 ) and a deconvolution method , such as clean ( hgbom 1974 ) .",
    "since agn are variable , it goes without saying that multi - frequency data to be compared must correspond to epochs separated by time intervals appreciably less than the timescales for variability of the source . when preparing data for techniques involving comparison of multi - frequency data , various instrumental differences between the datasets must also be taken into account .",
    "vlbi datasets at different frequencies will have different angular resolutions and sensitivities to structures on various scales due to the different baseline coverages of the observations .",
    "one approach to reducing these differences when comparing multi - frequency images is to match the baseline coverages at different frequencies by giving relatively low weights to the longest baselines at higher frequencies and to the shortest baselines at lower frequencies , e.g. , via tapering of the visibility data .",
    "alternatively , the images can be obtained without such weighting , but then all be convolved with the same clean beam before comparison .",
    "the size of the clean beam to be used in this case is ordinarily roughly equal to the central lobe of the dirty beam for the lowest frequency .",
    "the accuracy to which the positions of the clean components are known is limited by the resolution of the observing system , and convolving with a beam that was much smaller than the central lobe of the dirty beam would result in a `` superresolved '' image that may not be reliable .",
    "iterative imaging via self - calibration and a deconvolution algorithm such as clean is generally quite effective , but the absolute information about the coordinates of the source on the sky is lost during phase self - calibration , which essentially places the centre of gravity of the radio brightness distribution at the phase centre , which has coordinates @xmath13 . because most radio - loud agn are highly core - dominated , directly comparing multi - frequency self - calibrated vlbi images of agn essentially amounts to aligning these images on the observed vlbi core , which usually coincides very closely with the peak of the radio brightness distribution .",
    "however , the standard theory of extragalactic radio sources ( e.g. blandford & knigl 1979 ) predicts a frequency - dependent shift in the location of the vlbi core due to opacity effects in the core region .",
    "reabsorption of synchrotron radiation takes place in the ultra - compact region near the central engine of an agn , a mechanism which is more efficient at low frequencies .",
    "consequently , the peak brightness appears further along the jet axis in lower frequency observations .",
    "thus the alignment of multi - frequency images on their vlbi core results in a misalignment between images of different observing frequencies .",
    "this prediction is supported by observation : the frequency - dependent shift in core position has been measured for several quasars and micro - quasars ( see lobanov 1998 and references therein ) , and the effect is discussed in terms of its impact on high precision astrometry by fey ( 2000 ) , charlot ( 2002 ) , ros ( 2005 ) and boboltz ( 2006 ) .",
    "lobanov ( 1998 ) explains in detail how the frequency - dependence of the shift depends on physical conditions near the central engine .",
    "it is thus necessary to correctly align images prior to applying multi - frequency data - analysis techniques .",
    "this can be achieved in one of two ways .",
    "the first is by phase - referenced observations , first employed by marcaide & shapiro ( 1984 ) , in which a nearby source ( or sources ) is observed along with the target source .",
    "the reference source would ideally be a point source , to eliminate structure effects including those discussed above , but this is rarely possible since most sources show extended structure on the milliarcsecond scales available with vlbi .",
    "the position of the target source relative to the reference source can then be determined .",
    "the second method involves aligning images according to the positions of optically thin jet components ( i.e. components optically thin to synchrotron radiation , so that their positions are not affected by absorption effects such as those occuring in the core ) that are present in both images to be compared .",
    "this can be non - trivial , particularly if the source has a complicated structure , but has been employed effectively by several authors , such as paragi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who used this method to determine the radio core shift in 1823 + 568 .",
    "this difficulty in aligning complex images without distinct optically thin components detected at all frequencies to be compared was the main motivation for us to consider alternative methods of image alignment .",
    "the method we have developed to align multi - frequency images is based on the cross - correlation technique widely used in many fields , including biomedical signal processing and imaging ( panescu 1993 , frank & mcewan 1992 ) and remote sensing ( hartl 1976 ) .",
    "cross - correlation provides a measure of how closely correlated ( i.e. how alike ) two functions are .",
    "the use of this measure in image alignment gives an objective , quantitative assessment of how well two images are aligned , and does not depend on the presence of very compact features . by applying different shifts between images and calculating the cross - correlation coefficient for each shift",
    ", it is possible to determine which shift results in the best alignment .",
    "the normalised cross - correlation coefficient we used ( see , e.g. , dunn & clark 1974 ) is defined in two - dimensions as : @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the number of pixels in each direction in the two - dimensional images to be compared , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the intensities for the maps at frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 at pixel @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mean values of these two intensities over the region analyzed . although the source emission at a given location varies with frequency , all the radiation observed at radio frequencies is believed to be synchrotron radiation from the same population of relativistic electrons . therefore the optically thin total - intensity ( @xmath23 ) structures should be well - correlated despite local changes in the spectrum of the synchrotron emission due to variations in the local magnetic field , interaction with the surrounding medium and other effects . using this ( reasonable ) assumption , it is possible to determine the shift to be applied between maps by comparing the structures of optically thin regions of the source at different frequencies . the highest correlation between dual - frequency images",
    "should therefore be obtained when the areas being compared correspond to the same physical region of the sky .",
    "this method has the advantage that it takes account of the optically thin emission from the _ entire _ source , not just isolated compact components .",
    "the most widely used software for the calibration , imaging and analysis of radio interferometric data is the national radio astronomy observatory aips ( astronomical image processing system ) package .",
    "we have written a c program to implement the cross - correlation technique , which is external to but compatible with the nrao aips package .",
    "the input to the program are two images in the format produced by the aips task imtxt , and the program outputs files which can be imported back into aips using the task fetch .",
    "imtxt allows the user to export an aips image as a text file containing an array of floats representing the map values at each pixel location .",
    "conversely , fetch imports a text file in the format exported by imtxt as a map file which can be displayed by any aips tasks that work with images ( e.g. kntr , tvlod ) .",

    "the user specifies the maximum trial shift to be applied between the images .",
    "the procedure used to calculate the shift that best aligns the input images is as follows .",
    "1 .   strips of width @xmath26 , where @xmath26 is the maximum shift to be applied to the maps , are subtracted from each edge of the first map ( map 1 ) .",
    "an area of the same shape as the restoring beam , but whose size is specified by the user , is removed from the area in map  1 surrounding the ( at least partially ) optically thick core , whose position will be frequency - dependent and which usually corresponds to the peak of the map . in comparatively unusual cases , the brightest feature may not correspond to the core ; to enable the program to produce reliable results for this situation , we have included the option of the user specifying the position of the core .",
    "the remaining area is used in the comparison ( see fig .",
    "the second map ( map 2 ) is shifted so that different regions overlay this area each time . since the area of map  1 is not changed , the normalised cross - correlation coefficients can be compared directly to determine which part of map  2 is best correlated with the selected region .",
    "3 .   map  2 is first shifted so that its bottom left hand corner corresponds to the bottom left hand corner of the selected sub - area of map  1 .",
    "this corresponds to the maximum negative shift ( @xmath27 ) applied . map  2 is then shifted in right ascension , one pixel at a time , and the cross - correlation coefficient computed each time , until the maximum positive shift @xmath26 is reached .",
    "the image is then shifted by one pixel in declination , and the correlation coefficients for the next row computed in the same way .",
    "this is repeated until the maximum shift in both directions ( @xmath28 ) is reached , which occurs when the top right hand corner of map  2 corresponds to the top right hand corner of the selected subarea of map  1 .",
    "the program outputs to the screen the maximum correlation @xmath29 and the shift ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) at which it occurs .",
    "5 .   having found the best initial alignment between the two images , the program now applies the corresponding shift to map 2 , constructs a spectral - index map and blanks any optically thick points in this map , taken to be points with spectral indices @xmath32 .",
    "the theoretical limiting optically thick spectral index @xmath33 is rarely reached , but it is generally accepted that a positive spectral index implies some optically thick contribution in that region .",
    "the optically thick regions are blanked _",
    "after _ first calculating the shift with only the core region blanked , since the shift between the maps can result in a significant change in the spectral - index distribution , and thus in those regions which have @xmath32 .",
    "the cross - correlation procedure is then repeated , taking into account only the optically thin ( i.e. unblanked ) regions of the source , since the position of these regions is not affected by absorption effects .",
    "the program again outputs to the screen the maximum correlation @xmath29 and the shift ( @xmath30,@xmath31 ) at which it occurs .",
    "positive shifts correspond to moving the second image downward ( to the south ) and to the left ( east ) relative to the first image .",
    "in other words , a feature whose pixel location is ( @xmath34,@xmath35 ) in the first map is located at ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) in the second map .",
    "three files are output .",
    "one is simply a text file containing the array of cross - correlation values computed , while the other two are text files of the format recognised by the aips task fetch .",
    "one of these likewise contains the cross - correlation coefficients ; importing this image into aips and plotting it ( e.g with kntr ) shows the shape of the cross - correlation function .",
    "the other image text file displays the subarea of map  1 that was compared ; displaying this image can be useful in verifying the area to be blanked around the optically thick core . ideally this area should be large enough to cover virtually all of the core region , but not features in the inner jet ; it should cover at least one beam size , and usually more , since the shape of the beam and the very high flux emanating from the core will dominate the vlbi @xmath23 structure here .",
    "in all cases we have tested , we found the cross - correlation function to fall off monotonically from its peak .",
    "this lends credence to the hypothesis that the optically thin jet structures in the maps should be well correlated when aligned properly ( if small - scale variations were important the function could show secondary peaks where individual features align well rather than falling off uniformly , but we have never found this to be the case ) .",
    "obviously , the accuracy of the estimated shift between a pair of images will depend to some extent on the pixel size in the images being compared . in practice , it may be expedient , within reason , to use images with slightly smaller pixel sizes in order to derive more refined shift estimates .",
    "the results should not depend on whether the higher - frequency or lower - frequency images is used as map  1 : in either case , it is the relative shift that is being determined , and the shifts obtained with the higher - frequency map as map  1 will be the negative of those obtained with the lower - frequency map as map  1 . in practice , it may be expedient to compare results obtained blanking out core areas of several different sizes ( e.g. 2.0 times the beam area , 2.5 times the beam area etc . ) , to ensure that the optically thick core region is fully blanked , while as much of the optically thin inner jet is included in the correlation analysis as possible .",
    "we present two examples of applying the program in practice to align total - intensity images of agn obtained with the nrao very long baseline array at 7.9  ghz and 5.1  ghz : ( i ) for 2007 + 777 , which displays a fairly distinct optically thin jet feature that could be used to align the two maps in the `` traditional '' way , and ( ii ) for 2200 + 420 , which displays only fairly amorphous optically thin jet emission .",
    "the maps compared have matched cell sizes , map sizes and beam parameters .",
    "the vlba observations were made over 24 hours in july 2006 in a snapshot mode , so that the baseline coverage obtained was spread out over the time the sources were visible with all or nearly all of the vlba antennas .",
    "the data was obtained simultaneously at the different frequencies .",
    "the preliminary calibration and imaging of these data were carried out in aips using standard techniques ; some initial results are presented by osullivan & gabuzda ( 2008 ) , and a more complete analysis is in preparation .    for each of these two sources ,",
    "we show a superposition of the 7.9  ghz and 5.1  ghz @xmath23 maps before and after applying the derived alignment shift ( figs .  2 and 4 ) , and the spectral - index maps obtained before and after applying the derived alignment shift ( figs .  3 and 5 )",
    ". in both cases , we used a cell size of 0.1  mas during the initial total - intensity mapping , but used final maps made with a cell size of 0.05  mas as input to the program , to improve slightly the accuracy of the relative shifts obtained .    in the case of 2007 + 777 ,",
    "the derived shift of the 5.1  ghz relative to the 7.9  ghz image was 4 pixels ( 0.20  mas ) to the west and 0 pixels to the south , in the direction of the vlbi jet , as expected .",
    "the correctness of this shift is immediately obvious via a visual inspection of the superposed @xmath23 images ( fig .  2 ) and the spectral - index maps before and after applying this shift ( fig .",
    "3 ) ; the algorithm has obviously aligned a distinct optically thin jet component located @xmath38  mas to the west of the map peak . in the case of 2200 + 420 ,",
    "the calculated shift of the 5.1  ghz relative to the 7.9  ghz image was 4 pixels ( 0.20  mas ) to the south and 0 pixels to the east , again in the direction of the vlbi jet , as expected .",
    "it is less straightforward to estimate the correctness of this shift directly from the superposed @xmath23 maps in fig .  4 , but the spectral - index map after applying this shift shows appreciably more regular behaviour , with a smooth gradient in the spectral index from north of the core region to the jet extending nearly directly to the south ;",
    "in particular , a spurious region of optically thin emission to the north of the peak has disappeared .",
    "we also show the results of applying the cross - correlation technique to 4.8 and 1.6-ghz images of the agn 1803 + 784 ( gabuzda & chernetskii 2003 ) , as an example of the operation of the program when applied to two images at more widely separated frequencies .",
    "a superposition of the 4.8  ghz and 1.6  ghz @xmath23 maps before and after applying the derived alignment shift is shown in fig .  6 , and the spectral - index maps obtained before and after applying the derived alignment shift in fig .  7 .",
    "a cell size of 0.50  mas was used during the initial total - intensity mapping , but final maps with a cell size of 0.25  mas were used as input to the shift program .",
    "the derived shift of the 1.6  ghz relative to the 4.8  ghz image was 5 pixels ( 1.25  mas ! ) to the west and 1 pixel to the north , in the direction of the vlbi jet .",
    "although examination of the superposed @xmath23 images ( fig .",
    "6 ) does not enable an unambiguous estimate of the needed shift `` by eye , '' the correctness of the shift derived by our program is immediately obvious via a visual inspection of the spectral - index maps before and after applying this shift ( fig .",
    "7 ) . at first glance ,",
    "the `` slanting '' boundary between the regions of optically thick and thin emission near the core seems suspicious , but in fact , the 4.8-ghz vsop space - vlbi image for this epoch shows that the vlbi jet initially emerges to the northwest ( gabuzda 1999 ) , and this feature likely real ( the implied spectral - index gradient is roughly perpendicular to the direction of the small - scale jet ) .",
    "finally , we show the two - dimensional plots of the cross - correlation functions output by the program for 2007 + 777 , 2200 + 420 and 1803 + 784 ( fig .",
    "the cross - correlation plots contain a single peak , with a monotonic fall - off in the correlation coefficient with distance from the derived optimal alignment shift .",
    "we have developed a c program to determine the shift between two vlbi images based on a cross - correlation analysis of the images . in the past , it has been necessary to determine such shifts for images of agn by aligning compact optically thin jet components , which can be a somewhat subjective and not entirely unambiguous procedure . in addition , this method is difficult to apply to complex and/or extended agn jets without compact optically thin features suitable for such an analysis .",
    "the great advantage of our new approach is that it provides a straightforward , objective means to determine the shift between two images that makes use of all optically thin regions in the source structure , not just individual chosen features .",
    "our tests have shown that the program produces reliable shifts for images both with and without distinct optically thin features .",
    "the code can be compiled using a standard c compiler , and has been designed to take input files written by the aips task imtxt , and to output files that can be read by the aips task fetch , making it straightforward for radio astronomers familiar with aips to implement the code .",
    "the code can be obtained by contacting d. c. gabuzda ( gabuzda@phys.ucc.ie ) .",
    "we thank shane p. osullivan for allowing us to use unpublished images of 2007 + 777 and 2200 + 420 as examples of our alignment program , and for help in making the spectral index maps for 1803 + 784 .",
    "sc thanks ger croke for helpful discussions on the cross - correlation technique .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee , bob campbell , for helpful comments that led to improvement of this paper .",

    "<S> these effects must be corrected for as best as possible before multi - frequency data comparison techniques can be applied . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the origins for the afore - mentioned factors , outline the standard techniques used to overcome these difficulties , and describe in detail a technique developed by us , based on the cross - correlation technique widely used in other fields , to correct for misalignments between maps at different frequencies .    </S>",
