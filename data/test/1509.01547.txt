    "the mechanical behavior of solids is often successfully described by continuum mechanics of a homogeneous medium .",
    "polymer glasses , however , exhibit structural heterogeneity at the nanoscale . for instance , local elastic shear moduli evaluated in small volume elements containing several tens of monomers can differ substantially from the bulk macroscopic value @xcite . as a result , amorphous materials can be separated into stiff and soft regions . at the same time ,",
    "glassy dynamics at the monomer level is heterogeneous , with groups of particles relaxing rapidly in a collective manner while other regions remain essentially immobile @xcite .",
    "understanding the existence or absence of a link between local structure and dynamics is one of the important open questions in the physics of disordered materials .",
    "recent molecular simulations of a variety of model glass formers have provided strong evidence that the locations of structural rearrangements correlate with measures of structural heterogeneity .",
    "for instance , simulatons of a model polymer glass under tensile deformation show that nonaffine residual monomer displacements are largest in regions with small positive shear moduli @xcite .",
    "simulation studies of the athermal deformation of amorphous two - dimensional binary mixtures also indicate that the nonaffine displacement field resulting from the macroscopic shear deformations of a few percent is directly related to the spatial structure of the elastic moduli @xcite , while little correlation is found to other structural variables such as local density .",
    "an alternative description of structural heterogeneity that also untilizes a harmonic description has been developed around the notion of soft vibrational modes .",
    "amorphous solids generally exhibit an excess amount of low energy modes ( boson peak ) , and a large number of them are quasilocalized , i.e. they involve only very few particles @xcite .",
    "the particles involved in these modes exhibit structural differences in their neighborhood configuration @xcite , suggesting that they might play the role of defects in crystals .",
    "recently , it has become possible to identify the structural signatures of rearranging particles with generalized structure functions that describe radial and bond orientations @xcite .",
    "a `` softness field '' formed by the superposition of the amplitudes of the lowest frequency normal modes also yields a heterogeneous partitioning into hard and soft regions .",
    "multiple recent simulation studies in supercooled liquids @xcite and amorphous packings under shear at zero @xcite or finite temperature @xcite confirm that regions of large vibrational amplitude overlap with the loci of structural rearrangements .",
    "an advantage of the soft mode description over the elastic moduli approach is that the soft modes also anticipate the direction of particle motion in a rearrangement @xcite .",
    "this correlation is robust and insensitive to the specific model system or diagnostic of the rearrangement .",
    "low energy sound waves therefore scatter off flow defects and provide information about those collective particle motions that are most easily excited .    in a recent contribution , we explored quantitatively the robustness of this softness field for the prediction of monomer relaxation in aging polymer glasses @xcite for different temperatures and aging times .",
    "we showed that rearrangements identified as rapid changes in the particle positions ( hops out of local cages ) are up to seven times more likely at the softest regions , where the direction of motion also aligns near perfectly with the local polarization vectors .",
    "these correlations are only erased once more than 50% of the entire system has undergone rearrangements .    in the present work ,",
    "we report a study of the correlation between irreversible rearrangements and local softness in actively deformed polymer glasses .",
    "this is important because previous studies have focused only on steadily sheared two - dimensional monomeric glasses formers @xcite , while polymers are distinctly three - dimensional and exhibit strain hardening . here",
    "we subject the polymer to uniaxial tensile deformation ( extensional flow ) and compare to the simple shear protocol used in previous studies .",
    "moreover , we explore subsequently correlations between soft regions and local relaxation events in the regimes of aging , deformation , and recovery . during the aging phase ,",
    "correlations grow due to a descent into deeper energy minima , but return quickly to their as - quenched values once plastic flow sets in . in the uniaxial tensile deformation protocol , correlations rise again with increasing strain , which we show to arise from an increase in the degree of localization of the soft modes as the aspect ratio of the sample changes . in simple",
    "shear by contrast , this effect is absent and correlations remain near constant during deformation . during the recovery phase",
    ", correlations increase only weakly as inherent structure energies return to their undeformed values .",
    "we study the polymer glass using molecular dynamics techniques and the well - known finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ( fene ) bead - spring model  @xcite , which is an excellent computer glass - former  @xcite .",
    "each linear polymer consists of 50 identical monomers with covalent bonds along the polymer backbone that were modeled by a non - linear stiff spring - like interaction .",
    "inter- and intra - chain interactions between not covalently bonded monomers are modeled with a 6 - 12 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , which was truncated and force - shifted  @xcite with a cut - off of 2.5 times the bead diameter for computational efficiency , and to ensure that the hessian is defined .",
    "the latter is important for the analysis of the vibrational spectrum .",
    "all quantities are stated in the usual lj - units based on well energy @xmath0 , particle diameter @xmath1 , mass @xmath2 and characteristic time scale @xmath3 , which is just below twice the mean collision time .",
    "the simulation time step was set to @xmath4 , and all results are averaged over 20 independent simulation runs .",
    "we simulate n=10,000 particles comprising 200 polymers in an initially cubic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our simulation protocol is a direct extension of our earlier study that quantified the correlation between soft modes and irreversible particle rearrangements called hops in quiescent polymer glasses  @xcite .",
    "the glass is generated by rapidly quenching an equilibrated melt with density @xmath5 at constant volume ( nvt ) from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with a constant quench rate of @xmath8 .",
    "for the remainder of the simulation , the temperature is held constant . in a first step ,",
    "the glass is aged without deformation at zero pressure ( npt ) to the age @xmath9 at @xmath7 , which is just below the glass transition temperature . in the uniaxial tensile deformation protocol , the glass is then deformed in one direction with a constant strain rate @xmath10 , while the pressure perpendicular to the deformation axis is kept at zero . as a result , the simulation box shape changes from cubic to rectangular .",
    "the deformation ends at a final engineering strain @xmath11/l_z(0)=4 $ ] with @xmath12 being the simulation box size along the deformation axis . in a final step ,",
    "both deformation and barostat were turned off so that the system recovers at fixed volume and the stresses relax .",
    "this post - deformation recovery regime was explored for a time @xmath13 .",
    "the simple shear protocol imposes a constant shear rate of the same magnitude by deforming the simulation box into a parallelepiped . here",
    "no additional barostating is performed .",
    "two key measurements are performed during the simulation : at different times during aging , deformation and recovery , we first store a configuration snapshot for the identification of the soft modes and then detect irreversible particle rearrangements in the whole simulation box immediately following the time of the snapshot . as introduced in full detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate a softness measure for each particle based on its participation in the low energy vibrational modes .",
    "this calculation was done in multiple steps : starting from a snapshot , we first found the inherent structure using a combination of gradient descent and damped dynamics ( fire  @xcite ) algorithms with a minimal total force criterion .",
    "then , the hessian @xmath14 is calculated from the inherent structure particle locations @xmath15 as well as the potential energy @xmath16 , and the @xmath17 lowest energy eigenmodes are calculated using arpack .",
    "the softness of a particle is defined as the superposition of the participation fractions in the low energy vibrational modes  @xcite , @xmath18 here , the polarization vector @xmath19 is the projection of the eigenvector of mode @xmath20 on the degrees of freedom of particle @xmath21 .",
    "the softness field @xmath22 depends on a single parameter , the number of low energy modes @xmath23 , and the scaling factor is added to make the softness an intensive quantity in terms of @xmath24 .",
    "an optimal value of @xmath17 ( 2% of the modes ) is chosen based on our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "a particle @xmath21 is `` softer '' the larger @xmath25 , which is used to rank the particles according to their relative softness .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath22 is not in itself meaningful , since the participation fractions are normalized quantities , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : eigenmodes](a - c ) visualizes three exemplary low energy eigenmodes calculated at the end of the aging period by plotting their polarization vector fields .",
    "one can see that the modes ( a ) and ( b ) are quasi - localized , since large polarization vectors are concentrated on a small number of particles that are spatially clustered .",
    "the spectrum also exhibits extended , planar - wave like modes and an example is shown in panel ( c ) .",

    "irreversible particle rearrangements are identified using a detection algorithm that was introduced in a previous study  @xcite , where it is explained in greater detail . in short ,",
    "we monitor the trajectory of each particle on - the - fly during the simulation and isolate rapid changes or _ hops _ of particles by calculating the mean distance squared @xmath27 between the earlier ( a ) and later ( b ) half of the trajectory of particle @xmath21 in a time window that moves with the simulation . here , the averages @xmath28 [ @xmath29 are taken over all trajectory points in a [ b ] and @xmath30 [ @xmath31 is the mean position in the respective trajectory segment .",
    "a hop is detected when @xmath32 , and we record particle identifier , time of hop , as well as initial and final position .",
    "the value of the threshold is related to the plateau in the mean square displacement @xcite . to isolate the irreversible rearrangements we exclude back - and - forth hops of a particle between the same two positions .",
    "this is done by removing a sequence of two hops of the same particle , if the final position of the second hop is within a distance of @xmath33 of the initial position of the first hop .",
    "we discuss the spatial correlation between softness field and monomer hops in terms of a predictive success rate @xmath34 @xcite . here",
    ", the softness field is binarized into a soft spot map denoted @xmath35 by assigning a softness of one to the fraction @xmath36 of particles with largest softness and zero to the other particles .",
    "we then calculate the fraction of the first @xmath37 hopping particles that are part of a soft spot , or @xmath38 with @xmath39 if particle @xmath21 is one of the first @xmath40 particles to hop after the measurement of the softness field , and @xmath41 otherwise .",
    "figure  [ fig : correlation_deformation](a ) shows the predictive success rate measured at three different strains during the uniaxial tensile deformation ( qualitatively similar curves are found under simple shear ) .",

    "the dotted line indicates @xmath34 for randomly distributed soft spots ( no correlation ) for comparison .",
    "for all strains , we find a larger than random correlation between softness field and the occurrence of hops .    to facilitate the analysis of trends in the spatial correlation during aging , deformation and recovery , we now focus on the predictive success rate at a coverage fraction of 30% .",
    "this is the fraction where the difference between measured @xmath34 and uncorrelated value ( dashed line ) is maximal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation_deformation](d ) we show the evolution of @xmath42 during the initial aging period . in agreement with the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the correlation increases from @xmath43 to @xmath44 as the age grows by four orders of magnitude .",
    "panel ( e ) shows the predictive success rate measured at different points during uniaxial tensile and simple shear deformation . in the tensile case ( solid line ) ,",
    "the spatial correlation in the elastic regime at @xmath45 is roughly equal to the value found in the quiescent state immediately prior to the deformation . at the yield strain @xmath46",
    ", the correlation has decreased to @xmath47 and at the end of the strain softening regime ( @xmath48 ) @xmath42 has reached the pre - aging value @xmath43 .",
    "even larger decreases in fact below the pre - aging value are seen in the pure shear case .",
    "this reversal of the aging effects is consistent with mechanical rejuvenation , by which deformation strains exceeding the yield strain erase the thermal history and return the material to a freshly quenched glassy state @xcite .",
    "interestingly , trends in spatial correlation begin to diverge between the two deformation modes in the strain hardening regime . under uniaxial tension , we find that @xmath42 monotonically increases with growing strain .",
    "the increase accelerates at large strains @xmath49 , reaching a value of @xmath50 at @xmath51 , which is above the predictive success rate measured in the quiescent state prior to the deformation .",
    "by contrast , the correlation during simple shear saturates at the value of the freshly quenched glass for strains larger than one . in the recovery regime , investigated only for the tensile case ( panel ( f ) ) , @xmath42 first drops slightly but then increases again weakly as the material continues to age .",
    "( a ) mean participation ratio as function of eigenfrequency at three values of strain for uniaxial tensile @xmath52 and simple shear @xmath53 deformations ..",
    "( b ) mean participation ration of all @xmath23 modes used for the softness field calculation as function of total strain . ]",
    "what is the origin of the different behavior of the softness - rearrangement correlation in tensile vs.  simple shear deformation ? in order to answer this question , we analyze the low energy vibrational mode spectrum during the deformation period more carefully .",
    "the extent of localization of a mode @xmath20 can be quantified by the participation ratio @xmath54 a value of @xmath55 means that all particles are participating equally in mode @xmath20 , whereas a small value indicates that the mode is quasi - localized around a few active particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig : participationratio ] ( a ) we show the participation ratio @xmath56 as function of mode frequency @xmath57 . since the vibrational spectrum is a feature of the inherent structure , @xmath56 at strain @xmath45 reflects the quiescent state at the end of the aging period",
    "the participation ratios at the end of the strain softening regime ( @xmath48 ) are nearly unchanged , with a slight shift of the extended modes ( large participation ratio ) towards smaller frequencies for both deformation modes .",
    "important differences emerge in the strain hardening regime at @xmath51 .",
    "while @xmath56 for simple shear is unchanged , uniaxial tension deformation results in two new features : first , we find modes with large participation ratio at much smaller frequencies .",
    "this change is due to the large ( 400% ) elongation of the simulation box along the deformation axis in our uniaxial tension simulation , which allows modes with larger wavelength to `` fit '' into the simulation volume . in general",
    "one expects extended modes to emerge on the low energy side of the spectrum as the system dimension increases , since the material looks increasingly homogeneous on large length scales . at same time , however , we find that the participation ratios of the modes at @xmath58 are _ reduced _ compared to the undeformed system . with increasing linear dimension ,",
    "the likelihood of finding a low energy quasilocalized mode is therefore enhanced .",
    "this effect is absent in the simple shear case , during which the simulation box periods do not change .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : participationratio](b ) we show the evolution of the mean participation ratio @xmath59 of all @xmath17 modes used for the calculation of the softness field with deformation . for tensile deformation",
    ", we find a gradual reduction of the average participation ratio , indicating that the soft modes become more and more localized as the deformation grows .",
    "by contrast , the average participation ratio does not change during simple shear .",
    "these results suggest that the change in participation ratio is merely a consequence of the changing box dimensions during uniaxial strain . in order to separate deformation effects from geometry",
    ", we have equilibrated the same polymer glass in a simulation box that has identical shape to a deformed polymer at 400% strain and computed the distribution of participation ratio at zero load .",
    "these distributions are identical to those found at the end of the hardening regime , which confirms that the change in @xmath59 is of geometrical origin .",
    "we now show that the increasing degree of localization of the soft modes under uniaxial deformation explains the rise of the overlap @xmath42 between softness and rearrangements . to this end",
    ", we compare the evolution of @xmath42 to changes in the mean participation ratio in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : relativechange ] . to facilitate the comparison ,",
    "we introduce a scaling that normalizes these quantities by the extremal change during the simulation run .",
    "the relative change of a quantity q with regard to a reference value @xmath60 from the freshly quenched state is defined as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the extremal value measured during the aging , deformation and in the recovery regime . for the spatial correlation we use the maximal value , while for the mean participation ratio we use the minimal value .",
    "the top left panel shows that the mean participation ratio does not change during aging , while the overlap @xmath42 rises roughly logarithmically .",
    "the overlap between hops and soft modes improves as the system reaches deeper energy wells and the energy barriers for rearrangement rise with age . during uniaxial tensile deformation ( middle panel )",
    ", we find that after the initial rejuvenation drop , @xmath42 rises in lockstep with the mean participation ratio @xmath59 .",
    "this observation suggests that the improving overlap of @xmath42 in the hardening regime is indeed due to an increased amount of highly localised modes . during simple shear by contrast ,",
    "neither overlap nor mean participation ratio increase with strain .",
    "@xmath59 is again constant in the recovery regime where the simulation box size does not change .    the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : relativechange ] provide as additional information the evolution of the inherent structure energy , separated into contributions from pairwise lj interactions and covalent bonds . during aging ( left panel )",
    ", we see the well - known logarithmic aging increase of @xmath63 while the mean bond energy @xmath64 remains constant .",
    "these trends mirror those in the panel above for the overlap . in the deformation stage ( middle panel ) , @xmath63 decreases as the glass is pulled up higher on the energy landscape , while @xmath64 increases as more and more energy is stored in the covalent bonds of the aligning polymer chains .",
    "while this increase of @xmath64 with strain is also broadly consistent with the rise of the overlap measure in the uniaxial tensile deformation , it disagrees in simple shear deformation where the overlap is constant .",
    "moreover , in the recovery regime ( right panel ) , @xmath64 drops rapidly while @xmath42 is very weakly increasing .",
    "these observations provide further evidence that strain hardening does not influence the softness map - rearrangement correlations .",
    "our recovery regime is just long enough for both inherent structure energies to reach their undeformed values .",
    "we have investigated the correlation between local relaxation events , identified as irreversible monomer hops out of local cages , and a softness map constructed from the superposition of low energy vibrational modes , in polymer glasses during physical aging , deformation and structural recovery . in the as - quenched glass , hops are about twice as likely to occur on soft spots than elsewhere in the polymer .",
    "this correlation increases logarithmically to about 2.4 over 4 decades of aging time and rises because physical aging amplifies the influence of the potential energy landscape on the dynamics .",
    "both simple shear and uniaxial tensile deformation rapidly rejuvenate this correlation once plastic flow sets in .",
    "further uniaxial tensile deformation increases the soft spot - relaxation overlap again due to an increase in quasilocalized modes as the sample elongates in the tensile direction , while no such effect occurs in simple shear .",
    "strain hardening , although present in our model polymer , does not seem to play a major role in these trends .",
    "accordingly , the present effects can be expected in short molecule glass formers as well .",
    "the present results indicate that two factors control the ability of soft modes to predict structural rearrangement : position on the energy landscape , and degree of localization of the lowest energy modes .",
    "the lower the inherent structure energies and the higher the barriers , the better the ability of the potential energy landscape ( a t=0 property ) to predict dynamics at elevated temperature near the glass transition .",
    "additionally , the extent of overlap also depends on system size .",
    "although the longest wavelength modes tend to have plane wave character , increasing the system size simultaneously generates more highly localized modes below the boson peak , and these are most efficient in finding soft spots .",
    "these results call for a systematic study of finite size effects on the low energy vibrational spectrum of disordered solids and their relationship to rearrangements .",
