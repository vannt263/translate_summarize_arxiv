    "in his classical paper on quantisation of magnetic poles dirac ( 1931 ) remarked that `` non - euclidean geometry and non - commutative algebra , which were at one time considered to be purely fictions of the mind and pastimes for logical thinkers , have now been found to be very necessary for the description of general facts of the physical world .",
    "it seems likely that this process of increasing abstraction will continue in the future and that advance in physics is to be associated with a continual modification and generalisation of the axioms at the base of the mathematics rather than with a logical development of any one mathematical scheme on a fixed foundation . '' in accordance with this principle , the present paper further extends the work of dirac by exploring the ` dequantisation ' of magnetic poles .",
    "diverse and numerous versions of the magnetic pole construction and the associated charge quantisation condition of dirac ( 1931 , 1948 ) have appeared in the literature , but the basic model can be most concisely and accurately formulated in terms of the hopf fibration ( wu & yang 1975 ; trautman 1977 ; yang 1977 ) . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the rationale is as follows .",
    "the monopole potential is modelled as a connection @xmath0 on a nontrivial principal @xmath1-bundle @xmath2 over a subset of minkowski space . a charged matter field interacting with the monopole is accordingly modelled as a section of a vector bundle @xmath3 associated with @xmath2 via the representation @xmath4 of @xmath1 on a complex vector space .",
    "since @xmath0 then induces the connection @xmath5 on @xmath3 , the integer @xmath6 can be identified with the electric charge of the matter field ( see urbantke 2003 for a detailed account of the description of a magnetic monopole in the language of the hopf fibration ) .",
    "however , following the spirit of dirac , if we describe the monopole by a more general mathematical scheme , then the interaction of matter fields and magnetic poles _ with arbitrary real charges",
    "_ can also be modelled in a consistent manner .",
    "the present paper introduces a new sheaf - theoretic framework permitting an explicit construction of arbitrarily charged magnetic monopoles .",
    "this framework is likewise applied to generic @xmath1-bundles and also yields , as a by - product , the notion of a quasispin structure defined on arbitrary space - times .",
    "the results suggest that topological quantisation in general can be viewed from a more flexible perspective .",
    "although magnetic monopoles have not been observed experimentally , one important physical consequence of the present model is that their detection would not necessarily imply the quantisation of electric charge .",
    "likewise , an observed violation of charge quantisation would not necessarily imply the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "furthermore , grand unified theories require the existence of magnetic monopoles , and , according to conventional field theory described in terms of manifolds this necessarily implies charge quantisation , hence , the detection of nonintegral electric charge would indicate that the present scheme , based on sheaves rather than manifolds , may be physically more realistic . also , a sheaf construction permits the global description of fermion fields on lorentzian manifolds possessing no conventional spin structure , as an alternative to the cumbersome machinery of khler fermions .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we present a very brief sketch of sheaf theory for the benefit of readers less acquainted with the subject .",
    "this is intended to provide the bare minimum of information necessary for following the ensuing discussion ; for further details on sheaf theory , see , e.g. , bredon ( 1997 ) , kultze ( 1970 ) , or wells ( 2008 ) . in  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we develop the basic mathematical machinery used in later sections .",
    "the key idea here is the construction of a principal @xmath7-sheaf bundle which generalises the conventional notion of a principal bundle . in  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we prove that equivalence classes of principal @xmath8-bundles can , under certain hypotheses , be mapped injectively into equivalence classes of @xmath7-sheaf bundles .",
    "this implies that the dirac sheaf bundle constructed in  [ sec:5 ]",
    "does indeed constitute a generalisation of the conventional dirac monopole .",
    "the spherically symmetrical connection and curvature of the dirac sheaf bundle are constructed in  [ sec:6 ] , demonstrating that the magnetic charge of this model can assume arbitrary real values .",
    "the interaction of the generalised monopole with a charged matter field is considered in  [ sec:7 ] .",
    "dequantisation of more general @xmath1 bundles is considered in  [ sec:8 ] , with particular attention to gravitational and electromagnetic instantons . in ",
    "[ sec:9 ] the basic machinery developed earlier is applied to spin structures and dirac operators . in  [ sec:10 ]",
    "the paper concludes with a brief discussion of possible implications in diverse areas of physics .",
    "the concept of a sheaf over a manifold @xmath9 provides a way of interpolating local data and global data on x. we begin with the definition of a presheaf .",
    "a _ presheaf _",
    "@xmath10 on @xmath9 is a functor assigning , to each open @xmath11 , a group @xmath12 , abelian or otherwise , such that for each @xmath13 the restriction map @xmath14 , @xmath15 , defines a homomorphism and such that @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "an element @xmath18 is referred to as a _ section _ of @xmath12 over @xmath19 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath20 on @xmath13 is thus given by @xmath21 .",
    "the sections @xmath18 and @xmath22 are said to be _ equivalent _ at @xmath23 if there is a neighbourhood @xmath24 of @xmath25 such that @xmath26 .",
    "the equivalence class containing @xmath18 is called the _ germ _ of @xmath27 at @xmath25 , and the set of all such germs for any fixed @xmath25 is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the disjoint union @xmath29 of all the sets @xmath28 provides local information about the structure of @xmath10 .",
    "however , information concerning global structure has been lost , since we have discarded relations between the @xmath28 for varying @xmath25 . to retrieve some global structure ,",
    "we introduce a topology in the following manner . for a fixed @xmath18 the set of all germs @xmath30 for @xmath31",
    "is taken to be an open set in @xmath29 , and the topology of @xmath32 is defined as that generated by these open sets .",
    "the projection @xmath33 mapping @xmath28 into @xmath25 has the property that for any point @xmath34 with @xmath35 there is a neighbourhood @xmath36 for @xmath18 and @xmath37 such that the restriction @xmath38 is a homeomorphism onto a neighbourhood of @xmath39 .",
    "these ideas can be summarised as follows :    a _ sheaf _ of groups on @xmath9 is a pair @xmath40 such that    * @xmath29 is a topological space ( in general , not hausdorff ) ; * @xmath41 is a local homeomorphism of @xmath29 onto @xmath9 ; * each @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is a group called the _",
    "stalk _ of @xmath29 at @xmath25 ; and * the group operations are continuous with respect to the relative topology on the subset @xmath44 of @xmath45 .",
    "[ def:1 ]    for @xmath11 , a continuous map @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is called a _ section _ of @xmath32 over @xmath19 .",
    "the totality of such @xmath27 will be denoted @xmath48 .",
    "note that every element of the group @xmath12 specified by the presheaf functor naturally determines an element of @xmath48 , but the converse is only true locally .",
    "some of the key properties of a sheaf are as follows . if @xmath49 is an open covering of an open set @xmath50 , and if @xmath51 are such that @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath53 are such that latexmath:[$\\sigma_\\alpha|_{u_\\alpha\\cap u_\\beta } = \\sigma_\\beta    there exists an element @xmath18 with @xmath55 for all @xmath56 .",
    "the first property implies that if the restrictions of a pair of sections always agree , then the two sections are identical  thus a section over @xmath19 is determined by the totality of its restrictions to subsets of @xmath19 . the second property , somewhat complementary to the first , implies that if pairs of sections always agree on their overlapping regions then global section can be constructed from the local data  thus a section over @xmath19 may be assembled from consistent local sections on subsets of @xmath19 .",
    "a sheaf @xmath29 contains localised information concerning the topological space @xmath9 .",
    "global information about @xmath9 can then be extracted from @xmath29 by consideration of exact sequences , quotients , and so on . given two sheaves @xmath29 and @xmath57 over @xmath9 ,",
    "a sheaf homomorphism @xmath58 is a continuous map such that the stalk map @xmath59 is a homomorphism of @xmath60 into @xmath61 for each @xmath43 . a sequence of sheaf homomorphisms of the form @xmath62 such that the corresponding sequence of stalk maps is exact for all @xmath43",
    "is called a short exact sequence of sheaves .",
    "evidently , exactness is a local property . given a short exact sequence of sheaves , the induced sequence @xmath63 is exact at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , but in general not at @xmath66 .",
    "that is to say , the local exactness of a sequence does not imply exactness with respect to the global sections over @xmath9 .",
    "the measure of inexactness at @xmath66 can then be characterised by cohomology .",
    "recall that in the cohomology theories of @xmath9 one computes @xmath67 where @xmath8 is an abelian group . in sheaf",
    "cohomology the coefficients are not elements of a fixed group @xmath8 but are , rather , local sections of some sheaf @xmath29 over @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath68 be an open covering of @xmath9 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath612 and @xmath613 let @xmath236 and @xmath614 denote the sections of @xmath615 and @xmath616 determined by @xmath313 and @xmath617 , respectively , and write @xmath618 , @xmath619 . then ( [ eq:9.7 ] ) and ( [ eq:9.8 ] ) imply the relations @xmath620 and @xmath621 in accordance with the explanatory remarks following ( [ eq:6.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:6.3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the family of 1-forms @xmath622 , corresponding to the presentation @xmath623 , where , as usual , @xmath624 , determines a connection @xmath323 on the @xmath140-bundle @xmath593 in the sense of definition  [ def:6 ] .    of particular physical interest",
    "is the case where @xmath625 , @xmath626 ( the superscript @xmath627 denoting the component of the identity ) and @xmath449 is the canonical homomorphism with kernel @xmath628 . given a principal @xmath567-bundle @xmath570 over @xmath9 , a well - known theorem ( lawson & michelsohn 1990 , friedrich 2000 ) states that @xmath570 is covered by some principal @xmath8-bundle @xmath2 in the above sense iff the second stiefel class @xmath629 vanishes , and then the equivalence classes ( i.e. bundle equivalence compatible with the covering map onto @xmath570 ) of such coverings @xmath2 ( known as _ spin structures _ )",
    "are parameterised by the elements of @xmath630 .",
    "inequivalent spin structures may ( or may not ) be inequivalent as abstract @xmath8-bundles over @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , this can entail no inconsistency with proposition  [ prop:1 ] , since , if the hypothesis of that proposition is satisfied , then , by the above - cited theorem , there exists at most one spin structure @xmath2 over @xmath570 , and hence at most one @xmath150 , which , if existent , coincides with @xmath593 .",
    "however , the _ quasispin structure _",
    "@xmath593 exists in any case , even if @xmath150 does not .",
    "specifically , let @xmath9 be a smooth lorentzian manifold and @xmath570 the orthonormal frame bundle of @xmath9 .",
    "the levi - civita connection @xmath631 on @xmath570 then determines , as above , a connection @xmath632 on @xmath593 , and the spin representation @xmath633 , where @xmath634 denotes the spin module , gives rise to a space @xmath635 of particle fields ( see definition  [ def:7 ] ) .",
    "covariant differentiation in @xmath439 is then well - defined , just as was indicated , using local coordinates , in examples 2 and 3 .",
    "relative to a given trivialisation over @xmath110 in a sufficiently fine open covering , a quasispinor field @xmath636 is represented by a smooth section @xmath637 , determined up to a constant factor @xmath638 , that is , up to a sign @xmath639 .",
    "using the local 1-form @xmath640 relative to the given trivialisation , one obtains a conventional dirac operator @xmath641 over each @xmath110 , which , applied to @xmath642 , yields a section @xmath643 , likewise defined up to a sign .",
    "let @xmath644 denote the element of @xmath645 determined by @xmath642 .",
    "since the dirac operator behaves covariantly with respect to gauge transformations @xmath646 , the relations ( [ eq:7.1 ] ) , with @xmath647 , imply corresponding relations for the sections @xmath643 , which thus combine to yield an element @xmath648 .    according to a well - known theorem of geroch ( 1968 ) , the orthonormal frame bundle of a noncompact lorentzian manifold @xmath9 possesses a spin structure iff @xmath9 is parallelisable .",
    "a specific example of a noncompact lorentzian manifold not admitting a spin structure is described , e.g. , in clarke ( 1971 ) .",
    "the present formalism permits the global description of fermionic fields on such spacetimes , and the local properties of quasispinor fields and quasi - dirac operators in this context are clearly identical with those of their conventional counterparts .",
    "the foregoing considerations are likewise applicable to the construction of quasispinor fields and quasi - dirac operators on oriented riemannian manifolds , with @xmath649 , @xmath650 and @xmath628 . in the conventional theory ,",
    "the index of the dirac operator on a ` spinnable ' manifold @xmath9 is expressible , by the atiyah - singer index formula , in terms of the chen classes of @xmath9 ( lawson & michelsohn 1990 ; berline _ et al_. 1992 ) . even if @xmath9 is not spinnable , this expression is still well - defined . on the other hand ,",
    "since @xmath439 is not a vector space , the index of the quasi - dirac operator @xmath651 can not be defined in the conventional manner . of course",
    ", one could , by fiat , simply define the index of the quasi - dirac operator as the value of the atiyah - singer expression .",
    "however , a more interesting approach would consist in providing a general geometrical definition of the index for differential operators on @xmath439 , and proving that its value for the quasi - dirac operator is given by the atiyah - singer formula .",
    "this appears to pose a not entirely trivial problem .",
    "in the pseudoriemannian case , if @xmath9 is not space and time orientable , then one deals with pin structures ( see chamblin and gibbons 1997 for a discussion of physical applications ) .",
    "since the homomorphism @xmath652 is also a double covering , the foregoing construction is directly applicable , and one thus obtains _ quasipin structures _",
    ", even if true pin structures fail to exist .",
    "@xmath653-structures can also be generalised in a similar vein , but since in this case the central subgroup @xmath654 is not discrete , the situation is somewhat more complicated and will be dealt with elsewhere .",
    "mathematically sophisticated expositions of gauge theory tend to define connections and curvature _ ab initio _ on the total space of a principal bundle before pulling these quantities down to the base space via local trivialisations .",
    "some readers may , perhaps , inquire why we have not adopted this more elegant approach .",
    "the reason is that our sheaf bundles are not hausdorff spaces , hence not manifolds , so the tangent spaces are undefined .",
    "consequently , we must adopt the orthodox physical practice of working in terms of local sections .    in the relevant literature one occasionally observes heuristic statements to the effect that topological solitons already display certain quantal effects at the classical level .",
    "since charge renormalisation and running coupling constants can only result from field quantisation in the conventional theory , one could , in a similar vein , assert that the generalised solitons described above already display quantum field theoretic effects at the classical level .",
    "the coupling constants can walk even before they begin to run .",
    "we have constructed a family of generalised dirac monopoles @xmath302 which include the conventional @xmath304 as special cases .",
    "the @xmath304 interact with conventional wave functions @xmath655 , i.e. sections of the associated vector bundles , and likewise , mathematical consistency in the description of interactions involving the @xmath302 requires the introduction of generalised wave functions @xmath656 which are sections of certain sheaves .",
    "every conventional @xmath655 defines a @xmath656 , but there also exist @xmath656 that do not arise from any @xmath655 .",
    "for example , consider normalised wave functions defined over the circle @xmath657 . in the conventional model ,",
    "these include , e.g. , @xmath658 for integral @xmath6 , but not @xmath659 for arbitrary real @xmath294 . in our model ,",
    "however , the @xmath660 ( and more generally , @xmath661 , where @xmath662 is an ordinary normalised complex - valued function on @xmath663 ) represent well - defined sections of the sheaf @xmath664 , where @xmath282 .",
    "thus , rather than demanding knowledge of a global function on @xmath9 , determined only up to a globally constant phase factor , we merely demand , for any point @xmath84 , the knowledge of a function on some neighbourhood @xmath19 of @xmath25 , and determined only up to a constant phase factor on @xmath19 .",
    "the probabilistic interpretation of such a generalised wave function remains the same as in the conventional theory .",
    "moreover , differentiation with respect to @xmath25 and multiplication by ordinary functions @xmath665 are well - defined , so we can apply hamiltonian operators such as @xmath666 .",
    "magnetic monopoles , of either integral charge or otherwise , have not yet been encountered in experimental studies ( see , e.g. , milton 2006 for the current status of the experimental limits ) .",
    "the discovery of either nonintegral magnetic monopoles or nonintegral electric charges would tend to indicate that the above - described model is not merely more general mathematically but also more realistic physically than the conventional principal bundle model .",
    "such a discovery might therefore cast doubt upon the long - standing assumption that the venues for physical phenomena are necessarily manifolds , and suggest that sheaves , which provide a more local description , constitute the appropriate arenas for physical models .",
    "the sheaf - theoretic dequantisation of solitons and instantons for nonabelian gauge groups constitutes a challenging topic for research , and might have implications for grand unified theories .",
    "the above treatment of the dirac sheaf bundle can be adapted to cases where the dirac monopole is embedded within a nonabelian principal bundle , such as the t hooft monopole .",
    "the validity of the model constructed above would have certain obvious physical consequences .",
    "firstly , the detection of a magnetic monopole would not necessarily imply the quantisation of electromagnetic charges .",
    "conversely , an observed violation of charge quantisation would not necessarily imply the nonexistence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "a definite conclusion concerning the actual physical quantisation of electric charges remains elusive .",
    "for example , explosions of electron bubbles in liquid helium have been observed in the laboratory , suggesting that fractionally charged particles can possibly exist in isolation ( konstantinov & maris 2003 ) , although the interpretation of such experiments is controversial ( jackiw _ et al_. 2001 ; bender _ et al_. 2005 ) .",
    "other physical observations apparently consistent with nonintegral charges include the fractional quantum hall effect ( laughlin 1983 ) and geometric phase measurements in anisotropic spin systems ( bruno 2004 ) . the possible variability of the fine structure constant over the cosmological timescale ( bekenstein 1982 ) and the postulated fractional charges of the quarks in the deconfinement phase could also be relevant to this issue .",
    "a sheaf - theoretic formulation of the underlying quantum theory along the foregoing lines might conceivably clarify some of these diverse phenomena .",
    "the author hereby expresses his gratitude to c.  m.  bender , e.  j.  brody , g.  w.  gibbons , t.  w.  b.  kibble , b.  muratori , and r.  p.  w.  thomas for stimulating and informative discussions in connection with the foregoing material ."
