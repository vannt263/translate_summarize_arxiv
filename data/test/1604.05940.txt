    "in the classical graph coloring problem we assign a color to each vertex of a given graph such that the graph is properly colored , i.e. , no two adjacent vertices have the same color . the chromatic number @xmath2 of a graph @xmath0 is the smallest @xmath3 such that @xmath0 can be colored with @xmath3 distinct colors .",
    "deciding whether the chromatic number of a graph is at most @xmath3 is well known to be np - complete , even in the case with three colors .",
    "the online variant of graph coloring can be defined as follows : the vertices of @xmath0 arrive one by one , and an online algorithm must color vertices as they arrive so that the revealed graph is properly colored at all times .",
    "when a vertex arrives , the algorithm sees edges to previously colored vertices . to give the online algorithm slightly more power ,",
    "a copy of @xmath0 is sent at the start of the input . however , the exact correspondence between the incoming vertices and the vertices of the copy of @xmath0 is not known to the algorithm .",
    "this problem is called online graph coloring .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a graph parameter called the _ online chromatic number _",
    "@xmath4 of a graph @xmath0 .",
    "this parameter is analogous to the standard chromatic number of a graph : it denotes the smallest number @xmath3 such that there exists a deterministic online algorithm which is able to color the specified graph @xmath0 using @xmath3 colors .",
    "the online chromatic number has been studied since 1990 @xcite .",
    "one of the main open problems in the area is the computational complexity of deciding whether @xmath5 for a specified simple graph @xmath0 , given @xmath0 and @xmath3 on input ; see e.g. kudahl @xcite .",
    "we denote this decision problem as online chromatic number . in this paper",
    ", we fully resolve this problem :    [ thm : main ] the decision problem online chromatic numberis pspace - complete .    as is usual in the online computation model",

    "chooses an uncolored vertex @xmath1 from @xmath0 and sends it to without telling him to which vertex of @xmath0 it corresponds , only revealing the edges to the previously sent vertices",
    ". then must properly color ( `` paint '' ) @xmath1 , i.e. , cannot use a color of a neighbor of @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that in this paper is restricted to be deterministic .",
    "the game continues with the next round until all vertices of @xmath0 are colored .",
    "deciding the outcome of many two - player games is pspace - complete ; among those are amazons , checkers or hex , to name a few . however , in most of these games both players have roughly the same power .",
    "this does not hold for online graph coloringwhich is highly asymmetric , since has perfect information ( knows which vertices are sent and how they are colored ) , but does not .",
    "may only guess to which part of the graph does the colored subgraph really belong .",
    "this is the main difficulty in proving pspace - hardness .",

    "consider a path @xmath6 on four vertices .",
    "initially , sends two nonadjacent vertices .",
    "if assigns different colors to them , then these are the first and the third vertex of @xmath6 , thus the second vertex must get a third color ; otherwise they obtained the same color @xmath7 and they are the endpoints of @xmath6 , therefore the second and the third vertex get different colors which are not equal to @xmath7 . in both cases , there are three colors on @xmath6 and thus @xmath8 , while @xmath9 .",
    "note also that we may think of deciding where an incoming vertex belongs at some time _",
    "after _ it is colored provided that his choice still allows for at least one isomorphism to the original @xmath0 .",
    "this is possible only for a deterministic .    a particularly interesting class of graphs in terms of @xmath10 is the class of binomial trees .",
    "a binomial tree of order @xmath3 is defined inductively : the binomial tree of order 0 is a single vertex ( the root ) and the binomial tree of order @xmath3 is created by taking two disjoint copies of binomial trees of order @xmath11 , adding an edge between their roots and choosing one of their roots as the root for the resulting tree .",
    "thus @xmath6 is a binomial tree of order 2 with root on the second vertex of @xmath6 .",
    "it is not hard to generalize the example of @xmath6 and show that the online chromatic number of the binomial tree of order @xmath3 is @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this shows that the ratio between @xmath10 and @xmath2 may be arbitrarily large even for the class of trees .    * history and related work .",
    "* the online problem online graph coloringhas been known since 1976 @xcite , originally studied in the variant where the algorithm has no extra information at the start of the input .",
    "bean  @xcite showed that no online algorithm that is compared to an offline algorithm can perform well under this metric .",
    "the notion of online chromatic number was first defined in 1990 by @xcite .    for the online problem , lovsz ,",
    "saks and trotter @xcite show an algorithm with a _ competitive ratio _",
    "@xmath13 , where the competitive ratio is a ratio of the number of colors used by the online algorithm to the ( standard ) chromatic number .",

    "( note that the previously mentioned algorithmic results are valid for this model also . )",
    "kudahl  @xcite recently studied online chromatic numberas a complexity problem .",
    "the paper shows that the problem is conp - hard and lies in pspace .",
    "later  @xcite he proved that if some part of the graph is precolored , i.e. , some vertices are assigned some colors prior to the coloring game between and and also reveals edges to the precolored vertices for each incoming vertex , then deciding whether @xmath17 is pspace - complete .",
    "we call this decision problem online chromatic number with precoloring .",
    "the paper  @xcite conjectures that online chromatic number(with no precolored part ) is pspace - complete too .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to decide @xmath18 in polynomial time  @xcite .",

    "* the fact that online chromatic numberbelongs to pspace is not hard to see : the online coloring is represented by a game tree which is evaluated using the minimax algorithm .",
    "this can be done in polynomial space , since the number of rounds in the game is bounded by @xmath20 , i.e. , the number of vertices , and possible moves of each player can be enumerated in polynomial space : has at most @xmath20 possible moves , because it either uses a color already used for a vertex , or it chooses a new color , and has @xmath21 moves where @xmath22 is the number of colored vertices , since it chooses which colored vertices shall be adjacent to the incoming vertex . must ensure that sent vertices form an induced subgraph of @xmath0 , but this can be checked in polynomial space .    inspired by @xcite , we prove the pspace - hardness of online chromatic numberby a reduction to q3dnf - sat , i.e. , the satisfiability of a fully quantified formula in the 3-disjunctive normal form ( 3-dnf ) .",
    "an example of such a formula is    @xmath23    the similar problem of satisfiability of a fully quantified formula in the 3-conjunctive normal form is well known to be pspace - complete .",
    "since pspace is closed under complement , q3dnf - sat is pspace - complete as well .",
    "note that by an easy polynomial reduction , we can assume that each 3-dnf clause contains exactly three literals .",
    "we show the hardness in several iterative steps .",
    "first , in section  [ sec : largeprecol ] , we present a new , simplified proof of the pspace - hardness of online chromatic number with precoloringin which the sizes of both precolored and non - precolored parts of our construction are linear in the size of the formula .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : smallprecol ] , we strengthen the result by reducing the size of the precolored part to be logarithmic in the size of the formula .",
    "this is achieved by adding linearly many vertices to our construction .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : noprecol ] , we show how to remove one precolored vertex and replace it by a non - precolored part , while keeping the pspace - hardness proof valid .",
    "the cost for removing one vertex is that the size of the graph is multiplied by a constant , but since we apply it only logarithmically many times , we obtain a graph of polynomial size and with no precolored vertex .",
    "this will complete the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "we remark that removing the last precolored vertex is the most difficult part of proving pspace - hardness of online chromatic number .",
    "still , our technique for removing a precolored vertex can be used for any graph satisfying a few assumptions . in our analysis",
    ", often uses the natural greedy algorithm , which is ubiquitous in the literature ( see @xcite , @xcite ) :    the online algorithm colors an incoming vertex @xmath24 using the smallest color not present among colored vertices adjacent to @xmath24 .",
    "our first construction will reduce the pspace - complete problem q3dnf - sat to online coloring with precoloring with a large precolored part . given a fully quantified formula @xmath25 in the 3-disjunctive normal form",
    ", we will create a graph @xmath26 that will simulate this formula .",
    "we assume that the formula contains @xmath20 variables @xmath27 and @xmath28 clauses @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and that variables are indexed in the same order as they are quantified .",
    "our main resource will be a large precolored clique @xmath31 on @xmath3 vertices and naturally using @xmath3 colors ; the number @xmath3 will be specified later .",
    "using such a precolored clique , we can restrict the allowed colors on a given uncolored vertex @xmath1 by connecting it with the appropriate vertices in @xmath31 , i.e. , we connect @xmath1 to all vertices in @xmath31 which do not have a color allowed for @xmath1 .    for simplicity",
    "we use the precoloring in the strong sense , i.e. , is able to recognize which vertex in @xmath31 is which .",
    "we use this to easily recognize colors .",
    "however , it is straightforward to avoid the strong precoloring by modifying the precolored part ; for example by creating @xmath32 independent and identical copies of the @xmath32-th vertex in @xmath31 , each having the same color and the same edges to other vertices in @xmath31 and the rest of the graph .",
    "with such a modification , would able to recognize each color by the number of its vertices in @xmath31 .",
    "each vertex in @xmath31 thus corresponds to a color .",
    "colors used by are naturally denoted by numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , ...",
    "@xmath3 , but we shall also assign meaningful names to them .",
    "we want to construct a graph @xmath26 that has the online chromatic number @xmath3 if and only if the quantified 3-dnf formula can be satisfied .",
    "see figure  [ fig : gadgetexample ] for an example of @xmath26 and an overview of our construction .",
    "we use the following gadgets for variables and clauses :    for a variable @xmath33 which is quantified universally , we will create a gadget consisting of _ universal _ vertices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , connected by an edge .",

    "vertices @xmath41 ( for the positive literal @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 ( for the literal @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 ( the helper vertex ) , connected as a triangle .",
    "coloring of the first two variables also corresponds to setting the variable @xmath42 to true or false , but in a different way : @xmath41 has allowed colors @xmath46 and @xmath47 , while @xmath43 has allowed colors @xmath48 and @xmath47 .",
    "we want to avoid both @xmath41 and @xmath43 to have the color of type @xmath49 , and so the `` helper '' vertex @xmath45 can be colored only by @xmath46 or @xmath48 .",
    "note that the color choice for the vertices of @xmath42 means that if is presented any vertex of this variable , can recognize it and decide whether to set @xmath42 to @xmath40 ( and color accordingly ) or to @xmath50 .",
    "we call existential and universal vertices together _ variable vertices_.    for each clause @xmath29 , we will add four new vertices .",
    "first , we create a vertex @xmath51 for each literal in the clause , which is connected to one of the vertices @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponding to the sign of the literal .",
    "for example if @xmath52 , then @xmath51 is connected to @xmath34 , @xmath53 is connected to @xmath43 and @xmath54 to @xmath55 .",
    "the allowed colors on a vertex @xmath51 are @xmath56 .    finally , we add a fourth vertex @xmath57 connected to the three vertices @xmath58 .",
    "this vertex can be colored only using the color @xmath59 or the color @xmath60 .",
    "the color @xmath60 is used to signal that this particular clause is evaluated to be @xmath50 .",
    "if the color @xmath59 is used for the vertex @xmath57 , this means that the clause is evaluated to @xmath40 , because @xmath59 is not present on any of @xmath58 , thus they have colors of type @xmath61 and their neighbors corresponding to literals have colors of type @xmath49 .",
    "the last vertex we add to the construction will be @xmath62 , a final vertex .",
    "the vertex @xmath62 is connected to all the vertices @xmath57 corresponding to the clauses .",
    "the allowed colors of the vertex @xmath62 are @xmath63 .",
    "this final vertex corresponds to the final evaluation of the formula .",
    "if all clauses are evaluated to @xmath50 , the vertex @xmath62 has no available color left and must use a new color .",
    "we have listed all the vertices and colors in our graph @xmath26 and the functioning of our gadgets , but we will need slightly more edges .",
    "the reasoning for the edges is as follows : if presents any vertex of the type @xmath64 or @xmath62 before presenting the variable vertices , or in the case when the variable vertices are presented out of the quantifier order , we want to give an advantage to so it can finalize the coloring .    this will be achieved by allowing to treat all remaining universal vertices as existential vertices , i.e. , can recognize which of the two universal vertices @xmath65 corresponds to setting @xmath42 to @xmath40 .    to be precise , we add the following edges to @xmath26 :    every existential vertex @xmath66 is connected to all previous universal vertices @xmath34 , that is to all such @xmath34 for which @xmath67 .",
    "every universal vertex @xmath65 is connected to all previous universal vertices @xmath34 such that @xmath67 .",
    "every vertex of type @xmath51 is connected to all the universal vertices @xmath68 for @xmath69 . note that @xmath51 is connected either to @xmath34 , or to @xmath35 ; we do not add an edge to such vertices .",
    "every vertex of type @xmath57 is connected to all the universal vertices @xmath34 for all @xmath32 .",
    "the vertex @xmath62 is connected to all the universal vertices @xmath34 for all @xmath32 .",
    "we call all non - precolored vertices the _ gadgets _ for variables and clauses",
    ".        the full analysis can be found in appendix  [ app : section2 ] .",
    "we now make a step to the general case without precoloring by reducing the size of the precolored part so that it has only logarithmic size .",
    "our construction is based on the one with a large precolored part ; namely , all the vertices @xmath70 ( the gadgets for variables and clauses ) and the whole color clique @xmath31 will be connected the same way .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the gadgets for variables and clauses and @xmath31 .",
    "since @xmath31 is now not precolored and may send it after the gadgets , we help by a structure for recognizing vertices in @xmath26 or for saving colors .",
    "we remark that there is also a simpler construction with a logarithmic number of precolored vertices .",
    "if we just add precolored vertices to recognize vertices in @xmath26 , the following proof would work and be easier .",
    "however , when we replace a precolored vertex @xmath1 by some non - precolored graph in section  [ sec : noprecol ] , we will use some conditions on the graph @xmath71 that this construction would not satisfy .",
    "our structure will consist of many small _ nodes _ , all of them have the same internal structure , only their adjacencies with other vertices vary .",
    "each node consists of three vertices and a single edge ; vertices are denoted by @xmath72 and the edge leads between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we call the vertices @xmath75 and @xmath73 the _ lower partite set _ of the node , @xmath74 form the _ upper partite set_. see figure  [ fig : node ] for an illustration of a node .",
    "r2.8 cm     clearly , the online chromatic number of a node is two .",
    "the intuition behind the nodes is as follows :    if presents vertices of a node in the correct way , needs to use two colors in the lower partite set of the node .",
    "no color can be used in two different nodes .",
    "each vertex @xmath76 ( in the gadgets and in @xmath31 ) has its own node @xmath77 that identifies @xmath1 .",
    "if the vertex @xmath74 from @xmath77 does not arrive before @xmath1 is sent , can color @xmath74 and @xmath1 with the same color , thus save a color .",
    "otherwise , can use the node to recognize @xmath1 .",
    "universal vertices @xmath78 for each universally quantified variable @xmath33 should be distinguishable only by the same vertices as in the previous section .",
    "therefore they are identified by the same two nodes .",
    "let @xmath79 be the number of vertices in @xmath26 .",
    "we create @xmath79 nodes , denoted by @xmath80 , one for each vertex in @xmath26 . for any two distinct nodes @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) ,",
    "there is an edge between each vertex in @xmath81 and each vertex in @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , no color can be used in two nodes .",
    "we now define which nodes identifies which vertices and add edges between the original construction @xmath26 and nodes .",
    "let @xmath84 be the vertices in @xmath26 ( in an arbitrary order ) .",
    "then @xmath81 identifies the vertex @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath85 is a vertex @xmath55 or @xmath86 for a universally quantified variable @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the other vertex , then @xmath82 also identifies @xmath85 and @xmath81 also identifies @xmath88 .",
    "thus each node identifies one or two vertices and each vertex is identified by one or two nodes .    for a vertex @xmath76 and for a node @xmath77 ,",
    "if @xmath77 identifies @xmath1 , then we connect only the whole lower partite set of @xmath77 to @xmath1 , i.e. , we add two edges from @xmath1 to both @xmath75 and @xmath73 of @xmath77 .",
    "otherwise , we add three edges  one between @xmath1 and every vertex in @xmath77 .",
    "the only precolored part @xmath89 of the graph is intended for distinguishing nodes . since there are @xmath79 nodes in total , we have @xmath90 precolored vertices @xmath91 with no edges among them .",
    "precolored vertices have a color that may be used later for coloring @xmath26 ( the gadgets and @xmath31 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we again use the precoloring in the strong sense , i.e. , is able to recognize which precolored vertex is which .",
    "we connect all vertices in the node @xmath81 to @xmath92 if the @xmath93-th bit in the binary notation of @xmath32 is 1 ; otherwise @xmath92 is not adjacent to any vertex in @xmath81 .",
    "clearly , the node to which an incoming vertex belongs can be recognized by its adjacency to the precolored vertices .",
    "note that a vertex from nodes is connected to at least one precolored vertex and there is no edge between @xmath26 and precolored vertices .",
    "so far , we have introduced all vertices and edges in our construction of the graph @xmath71 .",

    "it follows that all colors in @xmath173 are used in the supernode .",
    "there are always @xmath114 colors used in the supernode , since otherwise there must be a color @xmath157 in @xmath77 that is not in @xmath113 , but both and prefer coloring @xmath112 using colors in @xmath77 and coloring @xmath77 using colors from @xmath113 . thus @xmath193 .",
    "since all colors in @xmath182 are used in the virtual graph @xmath178 ( this includes also colors in @xmath183 ) and uses the winning strategy on @xmath178 , we know that @xmath194 .",
    "overall , uses at most @xmath195 colors and we proved @xmath104 for @xmath101 constructed from a satisfiable formula @xmath95 .",
    "this concludes the proof of lemma  [ l : removeprecolvertex ] .",
    "let @xmath95 be a formula of size @xmath20 .",
    "we first construct a graph @xmath71 with @xmath196 precolored vertices @xmath91 as described in section  [ sec : largeprecol ] and  [ sec : smallprecol ] . then for each precolored vertex , we apply lemma  [ l : removeprecolvertex ] iteratively until we obtain a graph @xmath197 with no precolored vertex .",
    "we check that the graph satisfies both assumptions of lemma  [ l : removeprecolvertex ] in each iteration @xmath32 . the first assumption , @xmath5 if and only if @xmath95 is satisfiable , holds for the first iteration by lemmas  [ l : smallprecolsat ] and  [ l : smallprecolnotsat ] , and for every other iteration by the previous use of lemma  [ l : removeprecolvertex ] .",
    "recall the second assumption : in the winning strategy of in the case if @xmath95 is satisfiable , can color @xmath99 using before two nonadjacent vertices from @xmath97 arrive .",
    "moreover , if assigns the same color to a vertex in @xmath97 and a vertex in @xmath99 before two nonadjacent vertices from @xmath97 arrive , can still color @xmath0 using @xmath3 colors .",
    "let @xmath198 be @xmath71 and for each iteration @xmath32 let @xmath199 be the graph before removing the @xmath32-th precolored vertex @xmath200 .",
    "let the nonprecolored vertices of @xmath199 be partitioned into two disjoint induced subgraphs @xmath201 and @xmath202 such that all vertices from @xmath202 are connected to @xmath200 and no vertex in @xmath201 is connected to @xmath200 .",
    "let @xmath203 be the graph created from @xmath199 by the construction in lemma  [ l : removeprecolvertex ] ; we denote by @xmath204 and @xmath205 the cliques in the supernode .",

    "in other words , the color @xmath157 is intended for nodes and not used in @xmath26 .    for an iteration @xmath210 , recall that @xmath203 consists of parts @xmath206 , and @xmath202 ( except precolored vertices ) and that @xmath201 and @xmath202 form the graph @xmath199 from the previous iteration .",

    "( note that @xmath162 can not be from nodes , since there is complete bipartite graph between every two nodes and a node is never split between @xmath99 and @xmath97 . )    in both cases , this does not harm the winning strategy of on @xmath199 , because the algorithm assumes that may use the same colors for more vertices in @xmath218 or in @xmath219 .",
    "this concludes that the assumptions of lemma  [ l : removeprecolvertex ] are satisfied in each iteration .",
    "since @xmath220 iff @xmath95 is satisfiable , it holds that @xmath221 iff @xmath95 is satisfiable by lemma  [ l : removeprecolvertex ] ( for some @xmath100 ) .",
