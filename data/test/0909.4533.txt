    "the photometric variability of the eclipsing binary star lv  her ( tyc  2076 - 1042 - 1 ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 , j2000.0 ; spt f9 , @xmath11 ) was announced by @xcite . its period was estimated by @xcite as 2.634 days , by @xcite as 5.2674 days , by @xcite as 9.218 days , by @xcite as 18.1312 days , and by @xcite as 18.4359350 days .",
    "all photometric and spectroscopic work performed since this last study has confirmed that it is basically correct .",
    "the prior erroneous period values resulted from the very long orbital period , the similar eclipse depths ( 0.68 mag and 0.66 mag in @xmath0 ; see below ) , the extremely high eccentricity of the orbit ( 0.613 ) , and the resultant shift of secondary eclipse to a phase of 0.86 .",
    "this sort of erroneous period estimation is not unusual in this kind of situation @xcite .    largely because of this uncertainty",
    ", no determination of the absolute dimensions of the system has been made until now .",
    "in addition to an accurate determination of the eclipse ephemeris in  [ sec : ephemeris ] , this work presents new high - quality photometric and spectroscopic observations (  [ sec : photometry ] and  [ sec : spectroscopy ] ) that yield masses and radii on a par with the best determinations for eclipsing binaries to date (  [ sec : dimensions ] ) . in  [ sec : evolution ] we compare these determinations with models of stellar structure and stellar evolution . the high eccentricity and long period of lv  her",
    "make it an interesting case for comparison with tidal theory , which we present in ",
    "[ sec : tidal ] .",
    "we discuss our results in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our photometric work on lv  her began in 2001 and is based on observations obtained with two robotic instruments : the ursa telescope at kimpel observatory @xcite on the campus of the university of arkansas , and a robotic telescope at the nf observatory ( nfo ; * ? ? ? * ) near silver city , nm .",
    "kimpel observatory ( ursa.uark.edu ) consists of a meade 10-inch f/6.3 lx-200 telescope with a santa barbara instruments group st8 ccd camera ( binned @xmath12 to produce @xmath13 pixel images with 2.3 arcsec square pixels ) inside a technical innovations robo - dome , and controlled automatically by an apple macintosh g4 computer .",
    "the observatory is located on top of kimpel hall on the fayetteville campus of the university of arkansas , with the control room directly beneath the observatory inside the building .",
    "exposures of 60 or 120 seconds made through a bessell @xmath0 filter ( 2.0 mm of gg  495 and 3.0 mm of bg  39 ) were read out and downloaded by imagegrabber ( camera control software written by j.  sabby ) to the control computer over a 30 second interval , then the next exposure was begun .",
    "the observing cadence was therefore about 90 to 150 sec per observation .",
    "the variable star would sometimes be monitored continuously for 46 hours .",
    "lv  her was observed by ursa on 156 nights during parts of nine observing seasons from 2001 february 18 to 2009 april 8 .",
    "the total number of ursa observations is 6690 .",
    "the frames were analyzed by a virtual measuring engine application written by lacy that flat - fielded the images , automatically located the variable and comparison stars in the image , measured their brightnesses , subtracted the corresponding sky brightness , and corrected for the differences in airmass between the stars .",
    "extinction coefficients were determined nightly from the comparison star measurements .",
    "they averaged 0.25 mag / airmass .",
    "lv  her is tyc  2076 - 1042 - 1 .",
    "the comparison stars were tyc  2076 - 0580 - 1 ( comp , @xmath14 , as listed in the tycho-2 catalogue ; * ? ? ?",

    "both comparison stars are within 10 arcmin of the variable star ( var ) .",
    "the comparison star magnitude differences ( comp@xmath16ck ) were constant at the level of 0.013 mag ( standard deviation within a night ) , and 0.010 mag for the standard deviation of the nightly mean magnitude difference .",
    "the ursa differential magnitude ( var@xmath16comp ) of the variable star was referenced only to the magnitude of the comparison star , comp .",

    "we noticed early on during the observations that the nfo magnitudes showed a small but significant offset from night to night , on the order of a hundredth of a magnitude .",
    "the origin of the offset is a variation in responsivity across the field of view of the nfo combined with imprecise centering from night to night .",
    "these variations are a well - known effect of the optics when using wide - field imaging telescopes such as the nfo .",
    "we have removed most of this variation by using dithered exposures of open star clusters to measure this variation , fitting a 2-d polynomial ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and subtracting the variation during initial reductions ( photometric flat ) . the ursa observations , on the other hand , show this kind of effect to a very much smaller extent .",

    "color indices formed from these magnitudes can be used to estimate a mean effective temperature for the binary , which we discuss below in  [ sec : dimensions ] .",
    "the interstellar reddening can be estimated , for example , by comparison with the standard strmgren indices of @xcite , giving @xmath18 mag , or @xmath19 .",
    "another estimate is available from the reddening maps of the sky near the variable star from @xcite , which results in a larger value of @xmath20 mag at the estimated distance of the eclipsing binary .",

    "the same 3.85  gyr isochrone as before is shown with a dashed line .",
    "the stars are seen to be in the middle of the main - sequence band .",
    "a similarly good fit to the properties of lv  her is provided by the stellar evolution models of @xcite , shown in figure  [ fig : claretlogg ] , also for a metallicity constrained to the measured value .",
    "these models are similar to the ones used before in their treatment of convection ( @xmath114 ) , and also include overshooting ( @xmath115 ) , but differ in the details . in this case , we find that the best - fit age is 4.2  gyr , about 9% older than with the yonsei - yale models .",
    "the difference is of the same order as the age uncertainty discussed above .",
    "the high orbital eccentricity and our accurate measurement of the projected rotational velocities of both components constitute useful probes of tidal forces in the system and allow for an interesting comparison with the predictions from theory . for our initial comparisons",
    "we have used the radiative damping formalism of @xcite and @xcite , often invoked for this type of analysis , to calculate the critical times for lv  her corresponding to synchronization of the axial rotations , alignment of the rotational and orbital axes , and circularization of the orbit .",
    "these are then compared with the evolutionary age , which is 4.2  gyr according to the models by @xcite used in this section .",
    "the procedure follows closely that described by @xcite , and consists of integrating the differential equations describing the changes in these quantities along the evolutionary track for each star .",
    "we find that rotational synchronization due to tidal forces is not expected to occur for the primary until the system reaches an age of @xmath116  gyr ( @xmath117 ) , and the secondary synchronization is predicted to happen shortly after ( @xmath118  gyr , @xmath119 ) .",
    "this appears to be in agreement with the fact that the measured @xmath44 values are slower than expected for pseudo - synchronization in the eccentric orbit ( table  [ tab : dimensions ] ) , assuming the spin axes are parallel to the orbital axis ( but see below ) .",
    "the time of orbital circularization indicated by theory is 7.3  gyr ( @xmath120 ) , again consistent with the fact that the orbit is observed to be highly eccentric .",
    "these times are displayed graphically in figure  [ fig : tidal1 ] , along with the evolution of the radius of each star according to the evolutionary tracks .",
    "a somewhat unexpected result is that the times of alignment predicted by theory are also significantly longer than the current age of the system : @xmath121  gyr and @xmath122  gyr ( or @xmath123 and @xmath124 , in reference to figure  [ fig : tidal1 ] ) . at face value",
    "this indicates both spin axes may be inclined relative to the axis of the orbit , which is the opposite of what is almost universally assumed for binary systems .",
    "the long orbital period of lv  her could provide a plausible explanation , in principle , but in any case the misalignment makes it somewhat problematic to interpret the apparent lack of ( pseudo-)synchronization inferred from the measured @xmath125 , since the projection factor can no longer be assumed to be known .",
    "the calculations above involve a number of approximations implicit in the equations we have used , as described , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite . in particular , they are linearized around the equilibrium state , and are strictly valid only for relatively small eccentricities and near - synchronous rotation , and for small relative inclinations between the spin axes and the axis of the orbit .",
    "we have also ignored changes in the semimajor axis that occur concurrently with the evolution of other orbital elements .",
    "the condition on the eccentricity is most certainly not met for lv  her ( @xmath1 ) , and it is unclear a priori to what extent this may affect the conclusions above .",
    "this , and the potentially interesting situation regarding the spin axes , have prompted us to explore the situation in greater detail .",
    "we have directly integrated the more general differential equations ( valid also for high eccentricities ) that describe the evolution of the semimajor axis ( @xmath126 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath127 ) , angular rotational rates ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) , and inclination of the spin axes relative to the orbital axis ( @xmath130 in our nomenclature ) as given by @xcite , using a fourth - order runge - kutta method . because they are coupled , these equations must be integrated simultaneously , and as before the stellar properties have been interpolated from the evolutionary tracks at each time step .",
    "the turbulent dissipation timescale for stellar phases with convective envelopes is taken to be @xmath131 , where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath132 are the mass , radius , and luminosity of the star .",
    "for phases with radiative envelopes the timescales adopted follow closely those in eq.(17 ) and eq.(18 ) by @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions are of course not known , so we explored a range of values that give predictions matching the observed quantities at the current age of the system .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : tidal2]a , b for the eccentricity and orbital period .",
    "the initial values are @xmath133 and @xmath134  days at the starting age of @xmath135 . according to these calculations we expect the orbit to circularize at an age @xmath136 ( @xmath137  gyr ) , which is in fairly good agreement with our previous estimate despite the concerns expressed above .    also shown in the figure",
    "is the evolution of the angular rotation rate @xmath138 for each star , which we normalize for convenience to the orbital rate @xmath139 ( figure  [ fig : tidal2]c , d ; solid lines ) . for lv",
    "her we have no observational constraints on @xmath140 and @xmath141 , so the initial values are arbitrary and chosen to be the same . in principle",
    "they could be constrained by directly measuring the rotation periods of the stars due , e.g. , to rotational modulation by spots , although in practice this is difficult for a spatially unresolved binary .",
    "more importantly , these stars may be too hot to be affected significantly by spots .",
    "the ratio between the pseudo - synchronous velocity and the mean orbital motion is shown in figure  [ fig : tidal2]e , and this curve is repeated in figure  [ fig : tidal2]c , d ( dot - dashed line ) . as seen from the convergence of the dot - dashed and solid curves , the stars are predicted to reach pseudo - synchronization roughly at @xmath142 ( @xmath143  gyr ) , which is much younger than the evolutionary age .",
    "this is completely at odds with our previous estimate , showing the limitations of that approach for a system like lv  her .",
    "we also have no direct constraint on the relative angle @xmath144 between the spin axes and the orbital axis .",
    "furthermore , the relation between @xmath144 and the orbital and rotational inclinations @xmath145 and @xmath146 , both measured relative to the plane of the sky , is given by @xmath147 which involves an unknown angle @xmath148 between the sky - projected angular momentum vectors of the orbit and the stellar spin .    the spectroscopically measured projected rotational velocities of the stars , which we refer to more properly now as @xmath149 , do provide some indirect constraint on a combination of the theoretically predictable quantities , but this still involves the unknown angle @xmath148 . because @xmath150 is very nearly 90  for lv  her ( see table  [ tab : dimensions ] ) , we may make the approximation @xmath151 .",
    "we then have @xmath152 in this equation all quantities on the right - hand side are either known from stellar evolution calculations ( @xmath109 ) , or can be computed from the solution of the differential equations , except for @xmath153 , which depends on the observer s viewpoint . for the sake of illustration , we ignore this term in the following ( or consider @xmath148 to be small ) , so that @xmath154 . in figure  [ fig : tidal2]f we show the evolution of @xmath144 for four different initial values ( 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 ) .",
    "curves for the primary and secondary are nearly indistinguishable , so we show only those for the primary . once again the conclusion is very different from the one we reached with the equations by zahn : alignment of the spin axes with the orbital axis is achieved much earlier than the age of the system , at @xmath155 ( or @xmath156  gyr ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath149 curves for the primary and secondary , calculated using eq.([eq : tidal ] ) , are shown in the bottom panels and are compared with the measured rotations ( dashed line and shaded uncertainty region ) .",
    "the general trend is for the stars in lv  her to be spun up by tidal forces , but the calculations disagree with the observations at the current age of the system , predicting the measured rotations should be 16  kms@xmath41  for the primary and 15.5  kms@xmath41  for the secondary ( see also table  [ tab : dimensions ] ) . and",
    "@xmath141 have been chosen arbitrarily here , this does not affect the predicted rotational velocities at the current age because pseudo - synchronization occurs much earlier , independently of the starting values of @xmath140 and @xmath141 . ]",
    "these are nominally outside of the range allowed by the observational uncertainties .",
    "we consider it very unlikely that our measurements are off by as much as 3  kms@xmath41  for the primary and 2.5  kms@xmath41  for the secondary , since our formal uncertainty of @xmath231  kms@xmath41  is already conservative .",
    "the alternative would be a deficiency in the calculations , related to remaining approximations in the differential equations for this very challenging problem .",
    "a combination of both effects is also possible .",
    "an even more general treatment of the dynamical problem of tidal friction in binary systems with deformable components has been developed by @xcite , but the application is considerably more complex and is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we note , finally , that an empirical test of the prediction of alignment is available in eclipsing binaries by measuring the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this provides a direct measure of the angle @xmath148 between the sky projections of the spin axes and the axis of the orbit .",
    "as a result of our intensive spectroscopic and photometric monitoring , the absolute masses and radii of lv  her are now determined to 0.9% or better , and are among the best available for any eclipsing binary .",
    "in addition we have established the effective temperatures , as well as the overall metallicity .",
    "the latter quantity has not been determined for many eclipsing binaries , and is important because it reduces the degrees of freedom in the comparison with theory .",
    "unfortunately the precision of [ m / h ] ( and @xmath42 to some extent ) is limited in this case by poor knowledge of interstellar extinction in the direction of the star .",
    "this could perhaps be remedied with additional absolute photometric observations .",
    "nevertheless , the combination of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath42 , and [ m / h ] provides unusually strong contraints on stellar evolution theory .",
    "comparison with current models yields an excellent fit to the observations , and indicates the stars are approximately half way through their main - sequence phase , at an age between 3.8 and 4.2  gyr , depending on the model .",
    "eclipsing binaries with periods as long as that of lv  her are relatively rare and difficult to find , except perhaps in the course of automated variability surveys such as those designed to search for transiting planets , which often operate almost continuously for weeks or months at a time .",
    "the very high eccentricity of the system ( @xmath157 ) makes it the most extreme case among those with well - determined properties @xcite .",
    "although apsidal motion is expected , the apsidal period is predicted to be very long ( @xmath158  yr ) on account of the wide separation between the stars ; it may take decades for the effect to be detected and measured accurately .",
    "tidal theory is consistent with the observations in predicting that the orbit should not yet have been circularized by tidal forces .",
    "direct integration of the coupled differential equations for this problem according to @xcite indicates that the spin axes have already been forced into alignment with the orbital axis early on in the evolution of this system .",
    "the spins of both stars are also expected to be pseudo - synchronized with the orbital motion , although this is not quite in agreement with the measured rotations , and may indicate either large errors of measurement ( which we believe are unlikely ) or shortcomings in theory , or some combination of both .",
    "the case of lv  her highlights the importance of bearing in mind the assumptions under which the equations for tidal evolution have been derived . because of their ease of use and simpler interpretation , the linearized equations by @xcite",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have occasionally been applied to binary systems that may violate those assumptions to some degree ( namely , the requirement of small eccentricities and spin - orbit inclinations , and near - synchronous rotations ) .",
    "exactly when and how the theory breaks down is difficult to predict . with its high eccentricity , lv  her",
    "is one such case , as we have demonstrated here by comparing the critical times from the simpler formulation with the results from the more general equations given by @xcite .",
