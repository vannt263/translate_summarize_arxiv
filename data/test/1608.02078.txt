    "one of the most interesting stellar objects for nuclear astrophysics in the universe is a neutron star .",
    "it is not only an astrophysical object to be observed , but also a testing probe for high - density nuclear matter which can not exist on earth in a natural environment .",
    "it is believed that the baryon number density at the center of neutron stars reaches several times of normal nuclear matter saturation density ( @xmath0 ) . as the baryon number density increases",
    ", various new degrees of freedoms , such as hyperons , kaons , and even deconfined quarks , can come into the nuclear matter .",
    "the inner structure of neutron star is still unknown mainly because of the theoretical uncertainties in the extrapolation of dense matter physics to high densities  @xcite .",

    "neutron star s temperature provides additional information that can help us understand the inner structure of neutron stars .",
    "since the dominant contribution to the cooling of a neutron star at a given time strongly depends on the inner structure , by combining multiple observations of neutron stars at various ages , one may be able to identify eos which is consistent with neutron star cooling .    in this work ,",
    "we try to understand the thermal evolution of neutron stars with the nuclear eoss which include hyperons or kaons at high densities .",

    "we combine non - relativistic nuclear models and su(3 ) non - linear chiral model for the description of kaon interactions .",
    "for the cooling calculation , in addition to the standard cooling process , we include direct urca processes for both nucleons and hyperons and the neutrino emission caused by the condensed kaons .",
    "we neglect the nucleon superfluidity effects because its contribution is not crucial in explaining the observations once the nucleon direct urca process sets in as discussed in lim _ et al .",

    "however the effect is available only in very massive stars . in less massive stars",

    "we used skyrme nuclear force models and non - relativistic hyperon potential models to simulate the neutron star cooling .",

    "the threshold mass for the hyperon direct urca process is smaller than the one for the nucleon direct urca process , and the competition between these two processes plays a crucial role for the cooling of neutron stars .",
    "the presence of hyperons allows the hyperon direct urca process with a smaller fraction of protons compared with the nucleon direct urca process , and the creation of @xmath3 hyperons can trigger the nucleon direct urca process because the fraction of neutrons can be reduced .",

    "cooling curves for sgi and sgi@xmath72ybz6@xmath72sll3 models are identical for the masses less than @xmath81 because hyperons appear in the neutron stars with masses larger than @xmath81 . for the mass range @xmath82 ,",
    "the effect of hyperon is difficult to identify because the volume fraction or mass fraction with hyperon direct urca is negligible . for ski4 , similar conclusion can be drawn . hence cooling curves of neutron stars between @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    "can cover wide region in the temperature plot .",
    "in addition , if we include the dependences on surface elements of neutron stars , the cooling curves of neutron stars with masses in the range of @xmath68 to @xmath69 can cover most of the observations .",
    "the effect of kaon condensation is most dramatic for an eos which does not allow the nucleon direct urca process .",
    "if the superfluidity effect is not considered , sly4 model without kaons gives almost identical neutron star cooling curves independently of neutron star masses  @xcite .",
    "the presence of kaons enhances the neutrino emissivity so the cooling curves splits if the mass of neutron stars is greater than @xmath80 .",
    "therefore this model shows very limited influence of kaon condensation to the cooling of neutron stars in which the standard cooling is the dominant cooling mechanism . on the other hand , for other eoss which allow the nucleon direct urca process , such as ski4 and sgi models , the contribution from kaon neutrino emission is too small to be recognized in the cooling curve . in these cases ,",
    "the sudden drop in temperature occurs for the neutron stars with masses @xmath83 for ski4 models ( @xmath84 for sgi models ) . compared to the results with hyperons , the mass ranges are a bit higher to be consistent with temperature observations .    in summary",
