    "in the last years , a particular geometry has attracted the interest in the study of granular media , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is a quasi - two - dimensional system of spherical particles placed between two large parallel plates separated a distance smaller than two particle diameters , so that the particles can not jump on one another .",
    "the container is vertically vibrated to inject energy and maintain the system fluidized . when the system is seen from above , or from below , it looks like a two - dimensional granular fluid . in another series of experiments ,",
    "a vibrated monolayer of grains is also considered , but the system is open on the top @xcite .",
    "a peculiarity of these set - ups is that energy is injected in the bulk of the two - dimensional system , instead of at the boundaries , then allowing the generation of homogeneous reference states .",
    "actually , experiments show that the horizontal dynamics remains homogeneous under a large range of values of the parameters defining the system . on the other hand , when increasing the average density and/or decreasing the intensity of the vibration , the system exhibits a series of phase transitions @xcite and , in particular , a bimodal regime characterized by a single dense cluster of closely grains surrounded by a gas of quite agitated particles @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed trying to describe the effective two - dimensional dynamics of the vibrated system confined between two plates , the main issue being how to incorporate in the dynamics the mechanism of energy injection .",
    "a conceptually simple way is to consider an external noise term acting on each particle , so that the inelastic collisions are described in the usual way but the particles are subjected to random kicks between collisions @xcite .",
    "although it is true that this modeling leads to the existence of a uniform steady state , its possible relation with the state generated in the experiments has not been established .",
    "moreover , this stochastic driving does not conserve momentum .",
    "a very appealing alternative has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "taking into account that collisions between particles are the mechanism by which the kinetic energy acquired by the particles at the vibrating walls is transferred from the vertical degree of freedom to the horizontal ones , the idea is to modify the usual two - dimensional collision rule for inelastic disks , in order to incorporate a description of the energy transfer .",
    "this is done by introducing a characteristic velocity parameter @xmath0 that is added to each particle in the direction of the normal component of their relative velocity at the collision .",
    "consequently , the normal component of the relative velocity is increased by @xmath1 in each collision , in addition and independently of the effect of inelasticity as described by the coefficient of normal restitution .",
    "of course , this simple model assumes implicitly that there is no kinetic energy injection in the horizontal directions in the collisions of the particles with the plates , so no friction with the walls is considered .",
    "since the model is formulated at the level of particle dynamics , the methods of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theory developed for inelastic hard spheres and disks can be easily extended and applied to the new kinetics @xcite . in this way , hydrodynamic equations to navier - stokes order have been derived for dilute gases described by the boltzmann - like equation , with identification of the associated transport coefficients , which are given by the solutions of a system of first order differential equations @xcite .",
    "a peculiarity of the hydrodynamic equations , as compared with the navier - stokes equations of a normal fluid , is that the time derivatives of the hydrodynamic fields do not vanish in the homogeneous limit , i.e. there is an homogeneous hydrodynamics .",
    "this follows from the inherent non - equilibrium character of granular matter and , actually , it seems to be a quite general feature of systems exhibiting steady non - equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "of course , in the long time limit the homogeneous hydrodynamic equations lead to the steady state of the system .    upon studying the linear hydrodynamic stability of the system and the possible existence of instabilities driving the system to inhomogeneous configurations , it is important to carry out the analysis around the time dependent state defined by the homogeneous hydrodynamic equations , instead of considering linear deviations from the steady state .",
    "the analysis is trivially more general , providing information about the stability not only of the vicinity of the steady state but also on the homogeneous hydrodynamic trajectory relaxing towards it , i.e. hydrodynamic states outside the linear environment of the steady state are included in the analysis .",
    "it is possible that a system be stable near the homogeneous steady state but it be unstable for homogeneous configurations corresponding to values of the macroscopic fields far away from the steady ones .    in this paper , the linear hydrodynamic stability of the homogeneous evolution of the quasi - two - dimensional granular model",
    "is studied .",
    "the aim is to see whether the model is able to predict some kind of hydrodynamic instability of the homogeneous state and , hence , to open the possibility of some phase coexistence similar to the one observed in the experiments .",
    "moreover , the analysis presented serves to illustrate how the stability of general steady non - equilibrium states of molecular systems must be addressed @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that linear perturbations around some homogeneous states grow in the short time limit , although the linearized hydrodynamic equations predict that they decay afterwards .",
    "it follows that for these states a definite answer regarding its stability can not be reached from the linear analysis .",
    "consequently , molecular dynamics simulations of some of these states have been performed .",
    "they indicate that the system actually relaxes to the homogeneous time - dependent state , but that the mechanism seems to be quite complex , involving highly nonlinear hydrodynamic effects .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ s2 ] , the linear hydrodynamic equations around the time - dependent hydrodynamic homogeneous state are presented .",
    "they are written using dimensionless perturbations of the hydrodynamic fields around homogeneity , and have the form of a system of coupled first order diferencial equations with time - dependent coefficients .",
    "its solution is rather involved and has to be done numerically , except for the special case of the traverse velocity field , whose equation is decoupled from the rest and its solution can be written explicitly in terms of a well defined shear mode .",
    "the linear stability analysis is presented in sec .",
    "the results imply the need of a nonlinear analysis of the stability for some homogeneous states , something that seems to be too complicated .",
    "therefore , molecular dynamics simulations regarding these states have been performed and the results are shown in sec .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the homogeneous time - dependent states are all stable , although relevant inhomogeneous fluctuations can be observed on short time scales .",
    "the last section of the paper contains a short summary of the results and some comments on their relevance to explain the inhomogeneous states observed experimentally .",
    "the system considered is a granular gas composed of smooth inelastic spheres of mass @xmath2 and diameter @xmath3 , confined to a quasi - two dimensional geometry by means of two large parallel horizontal plates separated a distance smaller than two particle diameters .",
    "energy is injected into the system by vibrating the parallel walls , and the rate of energy injection is large enough as to render negligible the effect of the gravitational potential energy .",
    "interest is focussed on the two dimensional dynamics showed by the system when observed from above .",
    "this dynamics has been assimilated to that of a two - dimensional granular fluid , and a kinetic model has been proposed to describe the effective dynamics in the plane @xcite .",
    "the projections of the spheres are considered as inelastic hard disks of mass @xmath2 and diameter @xmath3 . to incorporate a mechanism trying to describe the transferring of the energy injected vertically to the horizontal dynamics ,",
    "the usual collision rule of smooth inelastic hard disks is modified , so that when two disks with velocities @xmath4 and @xmath5 collide , their velocities are instantaneously changed to new values given by @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the unit vector joining the centers of the two disks at contact , @xmath9 is the relative velocity , @xmath10 is the coefficient of normal restitution defined in the interval @xmath11 , and @xmath0 is some positive characteristic speed .",
    "this is the quantity trying to describe the way in which the energy goes from the vertical degree of freedom to the horizontal ones in the collisions of the original hard spheres .",
    "note that the above collision rule conserves momentum in the plane .",
    "since the model is formulated at the collisional level , the methods of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theory developed for inelastic hard spheres and disks @xcite can be easily adapted @xcite . from the liouville equation ,",
    "balance equations for the macroscopic fields , the number of particles density , @xmath12 , the velocity flow , @xmath13 , and the granular temperature , @xmath14 , are derived in a straightforward way , @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 in the above equations , @xmath18 is the pressure tensor , @xmath19 is the heat flux , and @xmath20 is the rate of change of the temperature due to the inelasticity of collisions .",
    "these three quantities are obtained as functionals of the distribution function of the system . in order to close the balance equations ,",
    "it is necessary to express @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 in terms of the macroscopic fields by means of some constitutive relations . in the low density limit",
    ", the dynamics of the system is expected to be accurately described by the boltzmann equation with the same degree of confidence as for elastic hard disks @xcite .",
    "then , by using an extension of the chapman - enskog procedure , it is possible to derive expressions for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , in the form of series expansions in the gradients of the macroscopic fields .",

    "the latter is peculiar of systems with inelastic collisions @xcite , vanishing in the elastic limit .",
    "finally , the expression of the rate of change of the temperature contains a zeroth order in the gradients term , @xmath33 , and an euler transport coefficient @xmath34 , which is also peculiar of inelastic collisions @xcite . for non - confined granular gases , it vanishes in the low density limit . in principle , the second order in the gradients contributions to the rate of change of the temperature @xmath23 should be also considered , since they lead to terms in eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) which are of the same order than the contributions coming from eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , these new terms are expected to be quantitatively negligible as compared with those terms from the heat flux and the pressure tensor .",

    "@xcite , and for the sake of completeness they are reproduced in the appendix .",
    "the general structure of the hydrodynamic equations can be justified by means of rather general arguments @xcite . nevertheless , it is important to realize that the presence of the characteristic velocity @xmath0 implies that a nondimensional parameter can be constructed as @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being a thermal velocity . as a consequence ,",

    "the main motivation is to investigate whether the hydrodynamic equations derived for the model are able to predict the bimodal regime that is observed in experiments @xcite , or at least the existence of some hydrodynamic instability compatible with its existence . due to the intrinsic nonequilibrium character of granular gases , the hydrodynamic equations of the model have the peculiarity of exhibiting a homogenous regime .",
    "this makes it possible to study the linear stability not only of the steady state eventually reached by the system , but also of the complete hydrodynamic homogeneous trajectory .",
    "showing how this analysis can be carried out in a particular case is another aim of the present work .",
    "this implies the linearization of the navier - stokes equations around a time - dependent state , and the resulting equations happen to have time - dependent coefficients with a dependence that can not be scaled out simply .",
    "the consequence is that the equations must be solved numerically .",
    "the analysis indicates a deep difference between homogeneous processes in which the system is heating and those in which it is cooling .",
    "while the former are always stable , the latter can in principle be linearly unstable when the time - dependent cooling rate is large enough .",
    "this is because the initial value of the eigenvalue associated to the shear mode can be positive indicating a growth of the perturbation of the traversal velocity , at least for a time period after the spontaneous perturbation . to determine what actually happens in the system , molecular dynamics of the model at low density",
    "have been performed .",
    "the picture emerging from them is that spontaneous fluctuations of the transversal velocity field with an amplitude increasing in time , can actually happen .",
    "moreover they can grown enough as to be necessary to consider contributions of terms that are nonlinear in the deviations of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "in particular , clustering of particles are formed .",
    "nevertheless , these nonlinear contributions force the fluctuations to decay to zero for larger times , i.e. the homogeneous time dependent reference state is stable .",
    "the conclusion is that the hydrodynamic equations of the system do not present any instability for homogeneous states , including as a particular case the steady state .",
    "consequently , it is not clear how it could describe the bimodal regime seen in experiments , and some modification of the model seems necessary .",
    "an appealing macroscopic approach to this issue has been presented in ref . @xcite and it seems worth trying to understand it on a more fundamental basis level , starting from a particle dynamics description . to put the above comments in a proper context ,",
    "it is appropriate to emphasize that they do not refer to the solid - fluid phase transition presented by elastic hard spheres or disks .",
    "this transition is also present in the model , although slightly modified .",
    "identify the details of the change deserves much more work and it is now in progress .",
