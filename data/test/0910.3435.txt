    "atom interferometry has opened new frontiers in precision metrology .",
    "highly sensitive gravimeters , gravity gradiometers , and gyroscopes have been constructed , and promising work has been done to integrate these sensors into a robust apparatus that can operate outside the laboratory with applications in inertial navigation and geodesy @xcite .",
    "moreover , atom interferometers have been used to make competitive measurements of the fine structure constant @xcite .",
    "since atom interferometric measurements of the fine structure constant do not assume the validity of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , while determinations of the fine structure constant based on measurements of the electron magnetic moment do make this assumption , comparison between the results of these two methods provides a stringent test of qed @xcite .",
    "in addition , an experiment to test einstein s equivalence principle with unprecedented precision is underway @xcite , and atom interferometric gravitational wave detectors offer the possibility to study gravitational radiation in frequency ranges complementary to ligo and lisa @xcite .",
    "atom interferometers have traditionally relied on matter gratings or light pulses to act as beam splitters and mirrors for matter waves , with atomic wave packets traveling freely between these interaction zones .",
    "light - pulse schemes using either raman pulses ( where the internal state of the atom is changed ) or bragg pulses ( where the internal state of the atom remains unchanged ) have been implemented , such as those described in @xcite . for a number of applications of light - pulse atom interferometers , such as measurements of gravity and rotation ,",
    "the sensitivity is proportional to the separation in momentum that can be attained between the two arms @xcite . in measurements of the fine structure constant",
    ", the sensitivity scales as the square of this separation @xcite .",
    "therefore , significant efforts have been devoted to the development of large momentum transfer ( lmt ) beam splitters .",
    "lmt beam splitters achieving momentum splittings of @xmath0 using multi - photon bragg pulses have recently been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "however , the required laser intensities to make significant improvements on this result may prove to be prohibitive @xcite .",
    "in contrast , lmt beam splitters that use several two - photon bragg pulses or a multi - photon bragg pulse of relatively small order to separate the two arms of the interferometer in momentum space , followed by the acceleration of one of the arms with an optical lattice , could potentially provide multiple order of magnitude increases in attainable momentum separations with relatively modest laser intensity requirements .",
    "an atom interferometer that uses this method has been successfully operated in a proof of principle experiment ( with a maximum demonstrated momentum splitting of @xmath1 ) @xcite . in a separate experiment ,",
    "an atom interferometer with @xmath2 lmt beam splitters has been realized using a similar technique @xcite .",
    "alternatively , both arms of the interferometer could be simultaneously accelerated in opposite directions by two different optical lattices after the initial splitting .",
    "using this second scheme , an interferometer with @xmath0 lmt beam splitters that achieves 15@xmath3 contrast and an individual beam splitter that provides an @xmath4 momentum separation have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the utility of atom interferometry hinges upon the ability to precisely calculate the phase accumulated along the different arms of an interferometer @xcite , of which the phase acquired during interactions of the atoms with light is an important component . indeed , the phase obtained by an atom during a raman or bragg pulse is well - understood @xcite .",
    "analogously , in order to take full advantage of the potential of lattice beam splitters , we must have a detailed understanding of the phase evolution of an atom in an optical lattice . in this paper",
    ", we provide a rigorous analytical treatment of this problem . to our knowledge ,",
    "such a treatment has not been previously presented in the literature .    based on this analysis",
    ", we propose atom interferometer geometries in which optical lattices are used to continuously guide the atoms , so that the atomic trajectories are precisely controlled for the duration of the interferometer sequence , with a different lattice guiding each arm of the interferometer ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : guidedinterf ] ) .",
    "we point out here a distinction in terminology between a lattice waveguide and a lattice beam splitter . here , a lattice waveguide is the use of a lattice to continuously control the trajectory of an arm of an atom interferometer .",
    "we note that two separate lattice waveguides can independently control the two arms of an interferometer , or a single lattice waveguide can simultaneously control both arms . in contrast",
    ", a lattice beam splitter is an interaction of relatively short time ( in comparison to a waveguide ) with the primary purpose of splitting the arms of the interferometer in momentum space rather than providing continuous trajectory control .",
    "the underlying physics behind lattice waveguides and lattice beam splitters is the same , and they can be treated with a common formalism . a single lattice waveguide that simultaneously transfers @xmath5 of momentum to the two arms of a ramsey - bord interferometer has been previously achieved in @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , our idea of using optical lattice waveguides to create a fully confined atom interferometer has not been previously considered .",
    "our analysis indicates that these lattice interferometers will offer unprecedented sensitivities for a wide variety of applications and that they will be able to operate effectively over distance scales previously considered too small to be studied by precision atom interferometry .",
    "for example , one particularly interesting configuration involves using two optical lattice waveguides to continuously pull the two arms of the interferometer apart , subsequently holding the two arms a fixed distance from each other in a single lattice waveguide that is common to the two arms , and then using two lattice waveguides to recombine the arms .",
    "such a configuration could be used , for instance , as a gravimeter .",
    "the sensitivity of lattice interferometers is illustrated by the fact that , given the experimental parameters stated in @xcite ( @xmath6 atoms / shot and @xmath7 shots / s ) , a shot noise limited lattice gravimeter whose arms are separated by 1 m for an interrogation time of 10 s has a sensitivity of @xmath8 @xmath9/hz@xmath10 .",
    "we perform phase shift calculations for these lattice interferometers using the theoretical groundwork formulated in this paper , and we discuss how lattice interferometers can both exceed the performance of conventional atom interferometers in many standard applications and expand the types of measurements that can effectively be carried out using atom interferometry .        the paper is organized as follows .",

    "iii . discusses the phase evolution of an atom in an optical lattice under the adiabatic approximation .",
    "iv . introduces the formalism of perturbative adiabatic expansion to calculate corrections to the adiabatic approximation , and sec .",
    "v. applies this formalism to calculate phase corrections to a lattice beam splitter .",
    "vi . proposes a number of interferometer geometries that make use of lattice manipulations of the atoms .",
    "the main results of the paper are eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : phasecorrection ] ) and ( [ eqn : phasecorrectionref ] ) , which show how to obtain analytical corrections to the lowest order phase shift estimates .",
    "these corrections are surprisingly large , and understanding them is vital to realizing the full accuracy of the sensor geometries proposed in sec .",
    "vi . , as well as other geometries utilizing optical lattice manipulations of the atoms .",
    "for example , the gravitational wave detector proposed in @xcite will likely make use of lattice beam splitters and/or waveguides .",
    "previously , the phase evolution induced by lattice manipulations was not sufficiently well - understood to allow for a detailed design of the atom optics system or an estimation of the corresponding systematic effects .",
    "an optical lattice is a periodic potential formed by the superposition of two counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "atoms can be loaded into the ground state of the lattice by ramping up the lattice depth adiabatically , and the lattice can then be used to impart momentum to the atoms and/or to control the atoms trajectories .",
    "optical lattices are thus a useful tool for atom optics .",
    "we begin our discussion of the lattice - atom interaction by finding a useful form for the hamiltonian .",
    "as is typical for many applications of atom interferometry , to minimize decoherence we assume that we work with atomic gases dilute enough so that the effects of atom - atom interactions are negligible .",
    "we first consider the hamiltonian in the lab frame , where for now we assume a vertical configuration with constant gravitational acceleration @xmath9 so that we have a gravitational potential given by @xmath11 .",
    "we expose the atom to a superposition of an upward propagating beam with phase @xmath12 and a downward propagating beam with phase @xmath13 , which couples an internal ground state @xmath14 to an internal excited state @xmath15 .",
    "the two - photon rabi frequency is @xmath16 , where we let @xmath17 denote the single - photon rabi frequency of the upward propagating beam , @xmath18 denote the single - photon rabi frequency of the downward propagating beam , and @xmath19 denote the detuning from the excited state .",
    "we depict the physical setup in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . making the rotating wave approximation and",
    "adiabatically eliminating the excited state as is standard procedure @xcite , we obtain the following hamiltonian  where the periodic term in the potential arises from a spatially varying ac stark shift and where @xmath20 is the magnitude of the wave vector of the laser beams @xcite :    @xmath21+mg\\hat{x}\\ ] ]    note that where the difference between the frequency of the upward propagating beam and the frequency of the downward propagating beam is denoted by @xmath22 , we will have the relation @xmath23 .",
    "for a given @xmath24 , the lattice standing wave will be translated by @xmath25 in the @xmath26 direction from the origin .",
    "thus , the velocity of the lattice in the lab frame is :    @xmath27    and we rewrite the lab frame hamiltonian as :    @xmath28+mg\\hat{x}\\ ] ]    in order to most readily describe the dynamics of an atom in an accelerating optical lattice , it is useful to work in momentum space . the @xmath29 term that appears in the lab frame hamiltonian makes such an approach difficult , especially when considering non - adiabatic corrections to the phase shift .",
    "however , we can change frames by performing a unitary transformation in order to obtain a hamiltonian that is easier to handle analytically . in the end",
    ", we will see that approaching the problem from the point of view of dressed states provides a convenient hamiltonian for our purposes .",
    "we consider the transformation procedure from the lab frame to the dressed state frame in appendix a , where we also introduce an intermediate frame that freely falls with gravity ( which we call the freely falling frame ) .",
    "we note that the general form of the unitary transformations considered in appendix a as well as the specific transformations to the different frames we consider can also be found in the appendix of @xcite .     and",
    "the lasers are detuned from the transition between the atom s internal ground state and excited state so that the atom s external momentum states are coupled through two - photon transitions , creating an effective lattice potential.,width=672 ]    it is convenient to absorb the initial velocity @xmath31 of the atom in the lab frame into the dressed state frame , so that velocity @xmath31 in the lab frame corresponds to velocity zero in the dressed state frame .",
    "the hamiltonian in the dressed state frame is , as derived in appendix a :    @xmath32    now , we will show how working in momentum space allows us to represent @xmath33 as an infinite dimensional , discrete matrix .",
    "this matrix is discrete because the optical lattice potential term , @xmath34 , only couples a momentum eigenstate @xmath35 to the eigenstates @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite . for the moment",
    ", we will examine the evolution of individual eigenstates of the dressed state hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "these eigenstates reduce to single momentum eigenstates @xmath35 when @xmath38 .",
    "the knowledge of how each of these eigenstates evolves under @xmath33 will allow us to describe the dynamics of an entire wavepacket .",
    "for the moment , we will only consider momentum eigenstates corresponding to an integer multiple of @xmath39 , since we have boosted away the initial velocity @xmath31 of the atom in the lab frame .",
    "we note that it is always possible to transform to a particular dressed state frame in which a given momentum eigenstate in the lab frame corresponds to zero momentum in that dressed state frame .",
    "the results we derive here can thus be readily generalized to arbitrary momentum eigenstates in a wavepacket , as we discuss in greater detail in appendix b.    we consider a discrete hilbert space spanned by the momentum eigenstates @xmath40 for integers",
    "@xmath41 , so that we can express any vector in this hilbert space as :    @xmath42    since this hilbert space is discrete , it is natural to adopt the normalization convention that @xmath43 .",
    "when considered as an operator acting on this discrete hilbert space , @xmath33 can be written as @xcite :    @xmath44    where we drop the common light shift .",
    "now , it is convenient to introduce the recoil frequency @xmath45 and the recoil velocity @xmath46 . in order to make our notation as compact as possible",
    ", we will be interested in the quantity @xmath47 , which is the velocity of the lattice in the dressed state frame in units of @xmath48 .",
    "we can express the second term of @xmath49 in a useful way by noting that @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath51",
    ". we can now write the discrete hamiltonian in a simplified form :    @xmath52 \\\\\\ ] ]    the matrix elements of this hamiltonian are :    @xmath53\\ ] ]    in matrix notation , the schrodinger equation for the discrete hilbert space takes the form @xmath54 , where we let @xmath55 be the matrix whose element in the @xmath56th row and @xmath41th column is given by @xmath57 and we let @xmath58 be the column vector whose @xmath41th entry is @xmath59 .",
    "now that we have determined the hamiltonian matrix @xmath55 , we have the appropriate machinery in place to describe the phase evolution of an atom in an optical lattice .",
    "we consider the process in which momentum is transferred to the atom through bloch oscillations .",
    "reference @xcite provides a thorough and insightful description of bloch oscillations in a number of different pictures . given our choice of hamiltonian",
    ", we work in the dressed state picture , which is discussed in sec . iv.b . of @xcite , making extensive use of bloch s theorem , the concept of brillouin zones , and the band structure of the lattice @xcite . as in the previous discussion , we consider the evolution of single eigenstates of the dressed state hamiltonian , noting that we can easily generalize our results to the case of a wave packet of finite width , as we address in appendix b.    initially , we consider the system to be in a momentum eigenstate .",
    "first , we adiabatically ramp up the lattice depth by increasing the laser power so that we load the system into an eigenstate of the hamiltonian . for the purposes considered here , we want the system to enter the ground eigenstate ( corresponding to the zeroth band of the lattice ) . in order for this to be achieved",
    ", a resonance condition must be met , which states that the velocity of the lattice must match the velocity of the atom to within @xmath48 .",
    "the loading will be adiabatic if the adiabatic condition @xmath60 is satisfied , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively denote the ground state and the first excited state of the hamiltonian @xcite",
    ". this condition will be easier to meet near the center of the band ( where the velocity of the lattice is identical to the velocity of the atom ) , because the energy gap @xmath63 between the zeroth band ( which corresponds to ground state ) and the first band ( which corresponds to the first excited state ) becomes smaller as the velocity difference between the lattice and the atom becomes larger ( which corresponds to moving toward the border of the first brillouin zone ) .",
    "the resonance condition is discussed further in appendix c.    in the lab frame , the atom accelerates under gravity , increasing the deviation between its velocity and the lattice velocity during the loading process . in the freely falling and dressed state frames , in which gravity",
    "is boosted away , this corresponds to the lattice accelerating upward while the atom remains at rest .",
    "this effect can negatively impact the loading efficiency if the loading sequence is sufficiently long so that the accrued velocity difference becomes a significant fraction of @xmath48 .",
    "in such a scenario , the effect can be ameliorated by accelerating the lattice in the lab frame to fall with the atom , which corresponds to the lattice velocity remaining constant in the freely falling and dressed state frames .",
    "furthermore , we note that in the case of a lattice lmt beam splitter , the lattice should only be resonant with one arm of the interferometer , so that negligible population from the other arm is affected .",
    "otherwise , the signal could be distorted by multi - path interference , causing a systematic error in the estimation of the interferometer phase shift .",
    "conditions for when the negative effects of off - resonant lattices can be avoided can be estimated using the hamiltonian matrix for an off - resonant lattice given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : offresmatrix ] )",
    ". we discuss off - resonant lattices quantitatively and in more detail in sec .",
    "vi .    after the adiabatic loading of the atom into the ground state of the hamiltonian",
    ", the frequency difference between the laser beams is swept to accelerate the lattice , periodically imparting momentum to the atom in units of @xmath39 . in the dressed state frame , this phenomenon can be understood in terms of avoided line crossings , which occur because the coupling between the atom and the laser beams lifts the degeneracy at the crossing points .",
    "we refer the reader to fig .",
    "10 of @xcite for a clear illustration of these avoided crossings . as the frequency difference",
    "is swept so that the system passes through the avoided crossings , the system remains in the ground state of the dressed state hamiltonian as long as the process is adiabatic .",
    "consequently , at each of the avoided crossings , the momentum of the atom increases by @xmath39 , which corresponds to a bloch oscillation . finally , after the acceleration of the lattice , the frequency difference is held constant while the lattice depth is adiabatically ramped down , delivering the system into the momentum eigenstate @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the momentum before the bloch oscillations and @xmath66 is the number of bloch oscillations .",
    "[ fig : latticeaccel ] depicts the lattice depth and velocity as functions of time for the process described above and shows a numerical simulation of a particular instance of this process : the adiabatic loading of the lattice from an initial state @xmath67 , the transfer of @xmath2 of momentum through 5 bloch oscillations , and the ramping down of the lattice to deliver the system into the final state @xmath68 .",
    "since under the adiabatic approximation we assume that the atom always stays in the ground state of the hamiltonian , the phase @xmath69 of the atom evolves as follows :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the instantaneous ground state eigenvalue of the hamiltonian and @xmath72 is the initial phase of the atom .",
    "in addition to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : adiabaticphase ] ) , there is also a berry s phase term @xcite .",
    "however , this term is zero for a linear external potential .",
    "therefore , there is no contribution from the berry s phase under the semiclassical approximation , as long as the external potential is treated as linear  we discuss the validity and ramifications of this approximation at the end of appendix a. we note that any such contribution would arise from the residual external potential terms of the dressed state hamiltonian that are non - linear in @xmath26 ( we collectively denote these terms as @xmath73 in appendix a and explain why they can often be neglected ) .     of momentum .",
    "the lattice depth and velocity are shown as a function of time in the right panel , where in this particular case the relevant parameters are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ( corresponding to a final lattice velocity of 10 @xmath48 ) .",
    "first , we adiabatically ramp up the lattice to a depth of @xmath78 so that the lattice is loaded into the ground state of the dressed state hamiltonian .",
    "subsequently , we accelerate and ramp down the lattice , leaving the atom in a single momentum eigenstate.,width=720 ]    we now consider how the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath55 change with @xmath79 , which we recall is the dimensionless velocity of the atom in the dressed state frame .",
    "say that the eigenvalues of @xmath80 are given by @xmath81 with corresponding eigenvectors @xmath82 , where the index @xmath41 runs from @xmath83 to @xmath84 . we choose to index the eigenvalues so that @xmath81 denotes the the @xmath41th eigenvalue labeled in order of increasing value .",
    "moreover , we let @xmath85 be the @xmath86th element of the column vector @xmath82 , so that @xmath87 . the transformation properties of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues under changes in @xmath79 can be deduced from bloch s theorem .",
    "it can be shown that when the lattice velocity is increased by @xmath88 , which corresponds to @xmath79 being increased by two , while @xmath89 is kept fixed , the new eigenvectors can be obtained through the following relation @xcite :    @xmath90    this simply represents a shift of the wavefunction in momentum space by @xmath39 , which is exactly what we expect , since increasing the lattice velocity by @xmath91 corresponds to undergoing a single bloch oscillation .",
    "the dependence of the eigenvalues on the lattice velocity can be expressed as follows :    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is periodic in @xmath79 such that @xmath94 for integer @xmath56 holds for all @xmath79 and @xmath93 vanishes when the condition @xmath95 holds .",
    "this periodicity follows directly from bloch s theorem , since increasing @xmath79 by @xmath96 corresponds to increasing the lattice velocity by @xmath97 , meaning that @xmath79 and @xmath98 are at the same point in the first brillouin zone .",
    "note that the dependence of the eigenvalue on @xmath89 can be calculated using the truncated matrix approximation discussed in sec .",
    "the relevance of this dependence to the phase shift of an interferometer and how this dependence varies with momentum are discussed in sec .",
    "v. and appendix b.    the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : evalue ] ) has a simple physical interpretation . where @xmath99 is the velocity of the lattice in the dressed state frame ( so that @xmath100 ) , note that :    @xmath101    which is simply the kinetic energy of an atom traveling along a classical trajectory defined by the motion of the lattice .",
    "the @xmath102 and @xmath93 terms represent the band structure of the lattice , with the @xmath93 term accounting for the bands deviating from being flat . for interferometer geometries in which lattices act as waveguides for the atoms , the net contributions to the phase shift from the @xmath103 and @xmath104 terms in the ground state energy and from corrections to the adiabatic approximation are often negligible , as explained in the following sections .",
    "in this case , the phase difference between the two arms of the interferometer is given by ( assuming that the two arms arrive at the same endpoint ) :    @xmath105 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\left [ \\int_{0}^{t } \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\text{lattice}}^{\\text{arm1}}(t)^2d t-\\int_{0}^{t } \\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\text{lattice}}^{\\text{arm2}}(t)^2 d t \\right ] \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath106 is the time elapsed during the interferometer sequence .",
    "observe that this expression for the phase difference can be obtained by assuming that the lattice potential acts as a constraint that forces the atoms in each arm to traverse the classical path traveled by the lattice guiding that arm . in this case",
    "the phase shift is just the difference of the respective action integrals over the two classical paths , as we would expect from the feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite . since the lattice is the only potential in the freely falling and dressed state frames , the action integrals yield eq .",
    "( [ eqn : feynman ] ) ( for an insightful treatment of the applications of path integrals in atom interferometry , we refer the reader to @xcite ) . the terms that we have neglected in eq . ( [ eqn : feynman ] ) embody corrections to the simple picture of the lattice as a force of constraint arising from the quantum nature of the motion ( e.g. , a small portion of the population leaving the ground state of the lattice ) , which can sometimes be important .",
    "however , our simple picture provides physical intuition into the lattice phase shift and is often sufficient to derive quantitative results .    to summarize , the eigenvalues of the lattice consist of a kinetic energy term , a term that depends only on the lattice depth , and a term that is periodic in @xmath79 , and the eigenvectors transform under a simple shift operation when @xmath79 is changed by @xmath107 for integer @xmath56 .",
    "these properties are a direct result of bloch s theorem .",
    "the symmetries that we have discussed allow us to conclude that if , for a given @xmath89 , we know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian for all @xmath79 within any range @xmath108 $ ] , we can subsequently determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for arbitrary @xmath79 .",
    "this result will prove to be useful from a computational standpoint , since the dynamics of the system are completely described by the solution within a finite range of @xmath79 .",
    "we now present the method of perturbative adiabatic expansion @xcite to determine corrections of arbitrary order to the adiabatic approximation .",
    "we note that the particular adiabatic approximation that we correct here refers to the adiabatic evolution of the ground state of the dressed state hamiltonian , rather than the adiabatic elimination of the excited state during the raman process , which is treated in @xcite .",
    "the corrections we consider will always be present to some extent , since lattice depth and velocity ramps occurring over a finite time can never be perfectly adiabatic .",
    "in addition , non - adiabatic corrections can be caused by perturbations arising from laser frequency noise and amplitude noise . although our analytical and numerical computations indicate that the contribution of non - adiabatic corrections to the overall phase shift will be highly suppressed for many interferometer geometries , it is important to have a generalized framework with which to treat these corrections in order to determine when they are important and to precisely calculate them when necessary .    during the course of this derivation ,",
    "it is convenient to parameterize the hamiltonian , eigenvalues , and eigenvectors using the single variable @xmath109 rather than the two variables @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "note that much of our discussion will follow a similar outline as the proof of the adiabatic theorem in @xcite .",
    "a more detailed version of the derivation presented here can be found in @xcite .",
    "for all times @xmath109 , we can express any state vector @xmath58 in hilbert space as a linear combination of the instantaneous eigenvectors @xmath112 of the dressed state hamiltonian , where in general the coefficients of each eigenvector can vary in time .",
    "the instantaneous eigenvectors satisfy the relation @xmath113 . choosing coefficients with a phase @xmath114 factored out , we can write :    @xmath115    to simplify matters further ,",
    "we choose the phase of @xmath112 so that each element of @xmath112 is real for all @xmath109 and varies continuously with @xmath109 , which we can do because the particular hamiltonian matrix @xmath116 we consider is a real - valued , hermitian matrix .    when applied to eq .",

    "( [ eqn : pulsephase ] ) is what would typically be called the laser phase in a light - pulse atom interferometer for an @xmath41-photon beam splitter .",
    "we note that as long as the resonance condition is met for the momentum eigenstates we are considering so that they are accelerated , the phase evolved during a lattice acceleration in the @xmath348 dressed state frame , is independent of @xmath329 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ds0phase ] ) .",
    "( this is true up to non - adiabatic corrections and the small periodic variations in the ground state eigenvalue ) .",
    "this makes dressed state frames particularly convenient for performing calculations involving wavepackets . in contrast , in the freely falling frame , the accumulated phase @xmath349 is dependent on @xmath329 , but this dependence cancels in the final expression for the phase shift between the two arms of an interferometer as long as the distance travelled by the atom while locked into a lattice is the same for both arms .",
    "note that momentum dependent contributions to the total phase shift must arise when we treat the problem purely in terms of dressed states , since the total phase shift is an observable quantity and must therefore be independent of the frame in which it is calculated .",
    "the key point to realize is that if the total distance traveled in the lattice is not the same for both arms , then the two arms will end up in two different dressed state frames .",

    "( [ eqn : velocityphase ] ) , where :    @xmath352    we note that @xmath353 can be calculated using the truncated matrix approximation described in sec .",
    "since @xmath353 is periodic in @xmath354 with period @xmath355 , the contribution @xmath356 of this correction term to the phase difference between the two arms of an interferometer will be highly suppressed if both arms load the atom into the lattice near the center of the zeroth band ( as discussed in sec .",
    "iii . ) and undergo a nearly integral number of bloch oscillations so that the effects of this periodic variation in the ground state eigenvalue will be largely common to the two arms , as verified by estimation of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : periodicphase ] ) and by numerically solving the schrodinger equation .",
    "here , we derive the resonance condition stated in sec .",
    "iii . , which says that for a sufficiently slow lattice depth ramp , the atom will be loaded into the ground state of the lattice if the initial velocity of the lattice is within @xmath48 of the initial velocity of the atom .",
    "first , we examine the eigenvalues of @xmath55 when @xmath357 . for @xmath357 , @xmath55 is diagonal matrix .",
    "since @xmath55 is a matrix defined in terms of the basis of momentum eigenstates @xmath40 for integer",
    "@xmath41 , when @xmath55 is diagonal these momentum eigenstates are also the eigenstates of @xmath55 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath358 ( which are just the diagonal elements of @xmath55 ) .",
    "we note that the effect of the @xmath359 term in the hamiltonian is to encapsulate the dependence of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian on the lattice velocity for any given lattice depth , which can be best conceptually understood from the point of view of the dressed state picture explained in @xcite .",
    "the resonance condition states that if the initial state is @xmath360 , then the initial velocity of the lattice must be within @xmath48 of @xmath361 .",
    "thus , the initial value @xmath145 of the dimensionless velocity @xmath79 must be in the range @xmath362 .",
    "we will now show why this condition on @xmath145 implies that the ground state of @xmath55 with @xmath357 is @xmath360 . where we write @xmath363 and let @xmath364 for integer @xmath365 , the eigenvalues of @xmath55 with the lattice depth set to zero are :    @xmath366= 4 e_r \\left [ -n_0 ^ 2 + ( \\delta n)^2 -n_0 \\delta- \\delta n \\delta \\right]\\ ] ]    for @xmath367 , @xmath368 will be most negative when @xmath369",
    ", so @xmath360 will indeed be the ground state of the hamiltonian when @xmath357 .",
    "therefore , as long as we ramp up the lattice slowly enough and keep the lattice velocity constant while doing so , the adiabatic theorem tells us that the atom will remain in the lattice ground state throughout the ramp up process provided that the ground state never passes through a point of degeneracy , which is indeed the case for fixed @xmath79 and @xmath367 .    the maximum rate at which we can increase the lattice depth while still maintaining the validity of the adiabatic approximation depends on @xmath370 .",
    "this statement follows from the adiabatic condition @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively denote the ground state and the first excited state of the hamiltonian . when the resonance condition holds , note that the first excited state will be @xmath371 .",
    "as @xmath370 increases toward 1 , the gap between @xmath372 and @xmath373 ( i.e. the energy gap between the zeroth and first bands ) decreases . to see why this is true",
    ", we observe that :    @xmath374    therefore , for the adiabatic approximation to hold , the maximum rate at which we can ramp up the lattice decreases as we increase @xmath370 .",
    "this result is identical to the statement in sec .",
    "iii . that adiabatic loading is more difficult to achieve near the border of the first brillouin zone .    after ramping up the lattice , we accelerate it until its velocity is within @xmath48 of @xmath375 where @xmath376 is the target momentum eigenstate",
    ". the ground state of the hamiltonian when the lattice has finished ramping down will therefore be @xmath376 , and as long as the entire process is adiabatic so that the atom remains in the ground state , the atom will indeed end up in the target state . by analogy to the previous discussion , the maximum rate at which we can adiabatically ramp down the lattice increases as the difference between the final lattice velocity and @xmath375 goes to zero .",
    "in order to calculate non - adiabatic corrections at arbitrary order , we define @xmath377 recursively in the natural way based on the notation of sec .",
    "iv :          where the last term includes @xmath20 sums and @xmath380 .",
    "in order for the expansion to be practical from a calculational standpoint , the series must converge quickly enough so that we do not have to find an unreasonable amount of terms .",
    "there are two types of terms that we can often neglect .",
    "first , where we assume that the system is initially in the ground state , it is often possible to neglect many terms of the form @xmath381 so that we only need to examine a relatively small number of eigenvectors .",
    "terms of this form indeed decrease rapidly as @xmath41 increases because the overlap of the @xmath41th eigenstate with the zeroth eigenstate is essentially nonexistent for large enough @xmath41 .",
    "second , we can often neglect all terms of order greater than some cutoff value",
    ". we will be able to do so as long as the time scale over which we are solving the problem is small enough so that integrating a @xmath20th order correction term against a factor of the form @xmath121 yields a @xmath382th order correction term that is much smaller than the correction term of order @xmath20 .",
    "note an important nuance in how we have phrased the above condition  we have mentioned nothing about a hamiltonian that varies slowly in time . the convergence of the perturbative series depends on the time interval of the solution .",
    "as long as the hamiltonian does not vary at an infinitely fast rate , we can always work on a small enough time scale so that the series converges rapidly . to solve the problem on time scales for which the series does not converge quickly",
    ", we can simply break the problem into multiple parts .",
    "this method provides with us with a means to describe the system for a hamiltonian that changes arbitrarily fast in time .",
    "having a slowly varying hamiltonian just serves to allow us to solve the problem without dividing it into as many parts ( much of the time we will not have to divide the problem at all , and in sec .",
