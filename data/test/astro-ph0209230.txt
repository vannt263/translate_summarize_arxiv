    "the distant globular cluster palomar 13 has been found to have a very high m / l ratio of @xmath0 and its profile can be well fitted either by a king profile with a power - law tail or a nfw model [ 1 ] with scale radius @xmath1pc and central density @xmath2 .",
    "a possible explanation is that this distant cluster @xmath3 is one of the numerous dark clumps predicted by cdm scenarios , which was not destroyed by the galactic tidal field .",
    "it may be a disrupted cluster as well , out of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "here we assume that the nfw profile is the signature of a halo made of cold particles .",
    "physics beyond the standard model could be supersymmetry .",
    "the lowest massive supersymmetric particle , i.e. the neutralino , is a natural candidate for cdm .",
    "if r - parity is conserved the neutralino is stable , is its own antiparticle and has a very small cross - section for annihilation .",
    "we assume that the halo of palomar 13 is made of neutralinos and calculate the flux in high energy @xmath4-rays due to their annihilation .",
    "theoretical physics beyond the standard model is reviewed by j. ellis in this book .",
    "the susy benchmark models have been proposed to provide a common way of comparing the discovery potential of future accelerators [ 2 ] .",
    "these scenarios correspond to 13 configurations of the 5 msugra parameters with the trilinear coupling parameter @xmath5 set to 0 .",
    "the models fulfill the conditions imposed by lep measurements , @xmath6 result and relic density constraint @xmath7 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath4 fluxes for the benchmark models bcgil in the `` bulk '' region with our current mc simulation programs : darksusy [ 3 ] and suspect [ 4 ] .",
    "the simultaneous use of the suspect and darksusy package allows to perform the rge evolution from the gut scale to the ewsb scale .",
    "the fluxes ( in @xmath8 ) obtained by varying the threshold energy and integrated within @xmath9 are shown in the following figure .",
    "the main points are that we need to work at low energy threshold and very low flux @xmath10 .",
    "these fluxes are not out of reach but ground - based ongoing instruments will have to be improved by one order of magnitude for that purpose .",
    "an array of 5 hesses ( each including four 15-m class telescopes like in hess ) , operating in adjacent areas at 5000 m altitude , would reach a flux limit of @xmath11 at 25 gev in 400 h. * with that flux limit most of the neutralino parameter space in the galactic center could be explored .",
    "this is roughly the instrument needed to demonstrate or disprove supersymmetry in astrophysics . *",
