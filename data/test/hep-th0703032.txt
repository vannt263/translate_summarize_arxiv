    "as the quantities to measure the extendedness of a particle , there are two important physical quantities :  the magnetic dipole moment ( * @xmath0*,mdm ) and the electric dipole moment ( @xmath1,edm ) .",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 is the magnetic flux density vector and @xmath4 is the electric field vector .",
    "both quantities , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , have the physical dimension of @xmath7 ( higher - dimensional operators ) .",
    "hence they do not appear in the starting lagrangian , and usually appear only through the quantum effect . in particular edm term , @xmath6 , violates the cp - symmetry .",
    "because of this , the experimental efforts to measure edm , as well as mdm , has been made vigorously .",
    "the latest result of the upper bounds are @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the neutron edm and @xmath10 is the electron edm .",
    "edm term can appear in the standard model , but the estimated magnitude is @xmath11e@xmath12cm.@xcite this is far less than the present experimental bound .",
    "hence the detection of edm implies the new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "thirring@xcite , very long time ago , showed edm , as well as mdm , appear in a 4d model reduced from the 5 dimensional model , kaluza - klein theory .",
    "the expected magnitude is far less than the experimental upper bound even at the present time . although the result is numerically not interesting , it has some qualitatively - interesting features such as the dual relation . in the recent development of the unified theories using the extra dimension(s ) ,",
    "randall - sundrum@xcite model has become one of the strong candidates for the realistic model . in the original papers by randall and sundrum ,",
    "the comparison between the two models is made mainly in the mass hierarchy .",
    "here we focus on another aspect , that is , the _ magnetic and electric dipole moment _ terms .",
    "the kaluza - klein theory has the long history.@xcite it is characterized by _ compactifying _ the extra manifold . in this procedure",
    "the radius of the compact manifold , @xmath13 , is introduced as the size parameter . on the other hand , in the randall - sundrum model@xcite ,",
    "the _ localized _ configuration in the extra space is utilized , instead of compactifying the extra space . in this procedure",
    "the size parameter , @xmath14 , of the localization ( `` thickness '' of the wall ) is introduced .",
    "both approaches accomplish the dimensional reduction by adjusting the size parameters .",
    "the content of this paper is based on the result of ref.@xcite .",

    "we specify the form of the metric as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all 4d quantities , namely , the 4d metric , the u(1 ) gauge field and the dilaton ( weyl scale ) field , respectively .",
