    "@xmath3    after totally geodesic @xmath4-spheres , clifford tori represent the next simplest minimal embeddings of closed surfaces in the round unit @xmath1-sphere @xmath5 .",
    "in fact marques and neves @xcite , in their proof of the willmore conjecture , have identified clifford tori as the unique area minimizers among all embedded closed minimal surfaces of genus at least one , and brendle @xcite has shown they are the only embedded minimal tori , affirming a conjecture of lawson .",
    "the first examples of higher - genus minimal surfaces in @xmath5 were produced by lawson himself @xcite , and further examples were found later by karcher , pinkall , and sterling @xcite .",
    "both constructions proceed by solving plateau s problem for suitably chosen boundary and extending the solution to a closed surface by reflection .    in this article",
    "we carry out certain constructions by using gluing techniques by singular perturbation methods .",
    "one begins with a collection of known embedded minimal surfaces .",
    "these ingredients are then glued together to produce a new embedded surface , called the initial surface , having small but nonvanishing mean curvature introduced in gluing .",
    "the construction is successful when the initial surfaces are close to a singular limit . the construction is then completed by perturbing the surface to minimality without sacrificing embeddedness .",
    "of course the size of the mean curvature and the feasibility of perturbing the surface so as to eliminate it both depend crucially on the design of the initial surface .",
    "gluing methods have been applied extensively and with great success in gauge theories by donaldson , taubes , and others . in many geometric problems similar to the one studied in this article obstructions",
    "appear to solving the linearized equation .",
    "an extensive methodology has been developed to deal with this difficulty in a large class of geometric problems , starting with @xcite , @xcite and with further refinements in @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a general discussion of this gluing methodology and @xcite for a detailed general discussion of doubling and desingularization constructions for minimal surfaces . in this article , however , we limit ourselves to constructions of unusually high symmetry ( except in section [ further ] ) and this way we avoid these difficulties entirely .",
    "the first desingularization construction by gluing methods for minimal surfaces with intersection curves which are not straight lines was carried out in @xcite and serves as a prototype ( see for example @xcite ) for desingularizations of rotationally invariant surfaces with transverse intersections without triple or higher points .",
    "( an independent construction by traizet @xcite has straight lines as intersections . ) for one earlier application of the gluing methodology in the context of minimal surfaces in @xmath5 see @xcite , where a `` doubling '' construction of the clifford torus is carried out ; this work has been extended in @xcite for `` stackings '' of the clifford torus and in @xcite for doublings of the equatorial two - sphere .",
    "the present construction also glues tori , but by desingularization rather than doubling .",
    "the idea of a desingularization construction for intersecting minimal surfaces in a riemannian three - manifold is to start with a collection of minimal surfaces intersecting along some curves and to produce a single embedded minimal surface by desingularizing the curves of intersection . assuming transverse intersection , this is accomplished , at the level of the initial surface , through the replacement of a tubular neighborhood of each component curve of the intersection set by a surface which on small scales approximates a minimal surface in euclidean space desingularizing the intersection of a collection of planes along a single line . in prior desingularization constructions",
    "the appropriate models for these desingularizing surfaces were furnished by the classical scherk towers of @xcite , which desingularize the intersection of two planes .",
    "one novelty of the present article is our use of the more general karcher - scherk towers , introduced in @xcite , which come in families desingularizing any number of intersecting planes and so accommodate curves of intersection whose complements , in small neighborhoods of the curves , contain more than four components . note that although having more than two minimal surfaces intersect along a curve is not a generic situation , it can happen in rotationally invariant cases as for example in the case of coaxial catenoids . extending the results of @xcite to such situations for example",
    "is an interesting but difficult problem because one would have to use the full family of karcher - scherk towers as studied in @xcite .",
    "a motivation for our construction is the observation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.7 ) that lawson s surfaces may be regarded as desingularizations of a collection of great @xmath4-spheres intersecting with maximal symmetry along a common equator . in this article",
    "we pursue analogous constructions with tori instead of spheres as proposed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 , page 300 ) .",
    "pitts and rubinstein have described one class of surfaces ( item 10 on table 1 of @xcite ) , similar to some of our surfaces , to be obtained by min - max methods .",
    "recently choe and soret @xcite have produced examples by solving plateau s problem for a suitably selected boundary , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "their examples resemble the simpler examples we construct .",
    "( to prove they are the same one would have to prove that the solution of the plateau problem is unique ; see remark [ r : unique ] ) . our construction has been developed independently and is more general in ways we describe below , and our strategy is quite different , based as we already mentioned on gluing techniques by singular perturbation methods .",
    "on the other hand our methods work only for high - genus surfaces .    to outline , we construct two infinite families of embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath5 .",
    "the first family consists of desingularizations of a configuration @xmath6 ( see [ e : wk ] ) of @xmath7 clifford tori intersecting symmetrically along a pair of disjoint great circles @xmath8 and @xmath9 which lie on two orthogonal two - planes in @xmath10 .",
    "the second family consists of desingularizations of a configuration @xmath11 ( see [ e : wk ] ) which is the previous one augmented by the clifford torus which is equidistant from @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in both cases",
    "the construction is based on choosing `` scaffoldings '' , that is unions of great circles contained in the given configuration , and which we demand to be contained in the minimal surfaces we construct .",
    "moreover , reflections with respect to the great circles contained in the scaffoldings are required to be symmetries of our constructions .",
    "we denote the scaffoldings we choose by @xmath12 or @xmath13 ( see [ scaff ] ) .    to construct the initial surfaces we replace tubular neighborhoods of the intersection circles with surfaces modeled on appropriately scaled and truncated maximally symmetric karcher - scherk towers",
    ". towers with @xmath14 ends are used along @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while classical scherk towers with @xmath15 ends are used along other circles of intersection ( present only in @xmath11 ) .",
    "the replacements are made so that each initial surface is closed and embedded , contains the applicable scaffolding , and is invariant under reflection through every scaffold circle ( see definition [ initsdef ] ) .",
    "these initial surfaces are perturbed then to minimality in a way which respects the reflections , so the surfaces produced are closed embedded minimal and still contain the scaffolding ( see the main theorem [ mainthm ] ) .",
    "note that lawson s approach also makes use of a scaffolding .",
    "our approach , however , gives much more freedom in the number of handles we include in the fundamental domain , while in lawson s method the fundamental domain is a disc so that plateau s problem can be solved .",
    "this makes no difference when considering the original construction of lawson in @xcite : we expect that the construction with more handles in the fundamental domain will still produce a lawson surface even though it does not a priori impose all the symmetries of the surface .",
    "when there are more than two circles of intersection involved , however , we can choose different numbers of handles on each of them and this gives a plethora of new surfaces as in the present constructions ( see the main theorem [ mainthm ] ) .",
    "it seems also rather daunting to try to construct even the simplest of our surfaces desingularizing @xmath11 by lawson s method .",
    "the present constructions motivate two important new directions for further study .",
    "first , what other similar desingularization constructions can be carried out in cases where there are obstructions due to less symmetry ?",
    "one has to deal then with the obstructions in the usual way by introducing smooth families of initial surfaces with the parameters corresponding to the obstructions as in earlier work ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we discuss this question in section [ further ] and we provide some partial answers .",
    "second , as remarked in the end of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2 ) , there are various natural questions about rigidity and uniqueness for the surfaces presently constructed which are similar to those asked ( * ? ? ?",
    "* questions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) about the lawson surfaces .",
    "in particular we are currently working to prove that the surfaces desingularizing @xmath6 can not be smoothly deformed to surfaces desingularizing @xmath2 clifford tori still intersecting along @xmath8 and @xmath9 but with different angles ( that is they can not `` flap their wings '' ) .",
    "more precisely we hope to prove that even with reduced symmetries imposed so `` flapping the wings '' is allowed , there are no new jacobi fields on our surfaces .",
    "@xmath3    as we have already mentioned the main difficulty of this construction as compared to earlier results is proving that under the symmetries imposed there is no kernel on the karcher - scherk towers .",
    "as for the classical singly periodic scherk surfaces ( @xmath16 ) @xcite , this is achieved by subdividing the surface suitably and applying the montiel - ros approach @xcite .",
    "our approach is also somewhat different than usual in some other aspects and we employ the high symmetry we have available .      @xmath3    in section 2 we study in sufficient detail the maximally symmetric karcher - scherk towers using the enneper - weirstrass representation and following @xcite . in section 3",
    "we study the geometry of the clifford tori and the initial configurations we will be using later , their symmetries , and the symmetries and scaffoldings we will impose in our constructions later . in section 4 we discuss in detail the construction of the initial surfaces and we study their geometry . in section 5",
    "we provide estimates for the geometric quantities on the initial surfaces .",
    "in section 6 we study the linearized equation and estimate its solutions on the initial surfaces .",
    "we finally combine these results to establish the main theorem in section 7 . finally in section 8 we discuss further results using more technology .",
    "given an open set @xmath17 of a submanifold immersed in an ambient manifold endowed with metric @xmath18 , an exponent @xmath19 , and a tensor field @xmath20 on @xmath17 , possibly taking values in the normal bundle , we define the pointwise hlder seminorm @xmath21_\\alpha(x ) = \\sup_{y \\in b_x }     \\frac{{\\left\\lvertt(x)-\\tau_{yx}t(y)\\right\\rvert}_g}{d(x , y)^\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the open geodesic ball , with respect to @xmath18 , with center @xmath23 and radius the minimum of @xmath24 and the injectivity radius at @xmath23 ; @xmath25 denotes the pointwise norm induced by @xmath18 ; @xmath26 denotes parallel transport , also induced by @xmath18 , from @xmath27 to @xmath23 along the unique geodesic in @xmath22 joining @xmath27 and @xmath23 ; and @xmath28 denotes the distance between @xmath23 and @xmath27",

    "we proceed to outline the construction of karcher @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath76 , which we will define in detail later , differs by a scaling and rotation from the surface described now .",
    "karcher considered the enneper - weierstrass data of @xmath77 on the closed unit disc in @xmath78 punctured at the @xmath14^th^ roots of @xmath56 .",
    "the embedding defined by the data maps the origin to a saddle point , the @xmath2 line segments joining opposite roots of @xmath56 to horizontal lines of symmetry intersecting at equal angles , the @xmath14 radii terminating at roots of unity to alternately ascending and descending curves of finite length lying in @xmath2 vertical planes of symmetry , and the @xmath14 circumferential arcs between consecutive roots of @xmath56 to curves of infinite length lying alternately in one of two horizontal planes of symmetry .",

    "a horizontal bar over a subset of @xmath91 denotes its topological closure in @xmath91 , and angled brackets enclosing a list of elements ( or sets of elements ) of @xmath96 indicate the subgroup generated by all the elements listed or included in the sets mentioned .",
    "[ tower ] for every integer @xmath0 there is a complete embedded minimal surface @xmath97 such that    a.   @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and every straight line on @xmath76 is contained in @xmath100 ; b.   for any connected component @xmath42 of @xmath87 the intersection @xmath101 is an open disc with @xmath102 ( the union of four horizontal rays ) ; c.   for each non negative integer @xmath103 the quotient surface @xmath104 has @xmath14 ends and genus @xmath105 ; d.   @xmath106 ( recall [ gsym ] and [ grefl ] ) and @xmath107 acts transitively on the set of connected components of @xmath108 , the set of connected components of @xmath87 , and the set of connected components of @xmath88 ; e.   @xmath109 ; f.   @xmath110 ; g.   @xmath111 ; and h.   there exists @xmath112",
    "so that @xmath113 has @xmath14 connected components , all isometric by the symmetries , exactly one of which lies in the region @xmath114 and the intersection of this component with @xmath115 is the graph @xmath116 over the @xmath117-plane of a function @xmath118 , which decays exponentially in the sense that @xmath119 we have @xmath120    the usual inner - weierstrass recipe ( see @xcite for example or any standard reference for the classical theory of minimal surfaces ) defines from the data [ weidata ] a minimal surface in @xmath91 parametrized by the closed unit disc in @xmath78 punctured at the @xmath121 roots of @xmath56 . requiring the parametrization to take the origin in @xmath78 to the origin in @xmath91 , it takes the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the @xmath124^th^ @xmath14^th^ root of @xmath56 and @xmath125 is the imaginary part of the branch of the logarithmic function cut along the ray from @xmath126 to @xmath127 and taking the value @xmath126 at @xmath24 .",
    "the symmetries can be read from the data by the following standard argument .",

    "consultation of [ weimap ] confirms that ( a ) the straight lines lie along the intersection of the single horizontal plane @xmath132 with the vertical planes of the form @xmath133 for @xmath134 , ( b ) the images of the circumferential arcs lie , alternatingly , in the two horizontal planes @xmath135 , and ( c ) the images of the remaining lines of curvature lie , consecutively , in the vertical planes of the form @xmath136 for @xmath134 .    below",
    "we will check that the parametrization [ weimap ] is in fact an embedding of the punctured unit disc .",
    "in fact we will show that the image of the punctured sector @xmath137 is embedded and intersects the planes @xmath132 , @xmath138 ,",
    "@xmath139 , and @xmath140 only along the curves just mentioned .",
    "the reflection principle for harmonic functions then implies that this image may be extended to a complete embedded minimal surface @xmath141 , invariant under reflection through any line in @xmath142 and through any plane of the form @xmath143 or @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "we define @xmath146 .",
    "items ( ii ) and ( iii ) and the first two claims of item ( i ) follow immediately , as do the containments @xmath147 , considering that item ( v ) and the equalities @xmath148 are clear from the definitions ( [ ck ] and [ ak ] ) of @xmath100 , @xmath87 , and @xmath149 alone . to see the containment @xmath150 note that any symmetry of the tower must permute the asymptotic planes , so must preserve their intersection , so must take any line in @xmath100 to a line orthogonally intersecting the @xmath151-axis ; we are assuming ( and confirm with the maximum - principle argument below ) that @xmath76 intersects the @xmath151-axis only where @xmath100 does , and from the expression ( [ tow2ff ] ) for the second fundamental form we know we have already accounted for all lines on @xmath76 through such points .",
    "the equalities @xmath152 are also immediate consequences of the definitions .",
    "in particular reflection through the @xmath132 plane preserves @xmath100 , but it does not preserve @xmath76 ( because , for example , the normal to @xmath76 is not constantly vertical along the lines @xmath153 ) , so @xmath154 . now , since @xmath155 has index @xmath4 in @xmath156 and @xmath157 , in fact @xmath158",
    ".    thus we have checked items ( ii)-(vii ) , as well as the first two claims of ( i ) , and the transitivity claim in ( iv ) is now obvious . to verify the remaining claim in ( i ) , note that any straight line in @xmath76 , by virtue of the latter s minimality , is a line of reflectional symmetry . on the other hand reflection through a straight line in @xmath91",
    "preserves @xmath87 only if the line is the @xmath151-axis ( and then only for @xmath2 even ) or if it is contained in @xmath100 or @xmath159 .",
    "it is easy to see , however , that of these lines only those contained in @xmath100 lie on the surface .",
    "( for example [ weidata ] and [ weimap ] reveal that at easily identified points where any of the other lines do intersect the surface the normal to the surface there is parallel to the line . )",
    "in addition to checking ( viii ) , it remains to show that the image of the region @xmath33 is embedded and intersects the planes @xmath132",
    ", @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 as described above . that the tower is embedded may be established by recognizing the conjugate surface of the region between two consecutive horizontal planes of symmetry as a graph  specifically the solution to the jenkins - serrin problem",
    "@xcite on a regular @xmath14-gon  and then appealing to a theorem of krust .",
    "see @xcite for details on this approach .",
    "alternatively we show embeddedness more directly as follows and in the process identify the intersection of the image of @xmath33 with these four planes .",
    "recall that @xmath33 is the punctured sector @xmath160 . from [ weimap ]",
    "it is clear that @xmath161 is positive along the radial segment from the origin to @xmath24 and vanishes along both the radial segment from the origin to @xmath162 and the circular arc from @xmath24 to @xmath162 .",
    "a sufficiently small circular arc , centered at @xmath163 , which originates on the segment from @xmath126 to @xmath162 and terminates on the circumferential arc from @xmath162 to @xmath24 , can be seen from [ weimap ] to have height monotonically increasing from @xmath126 to @xmath164 .",
    "the maximum principle then implies that the image of @xmath33 is contained in the slab @xmath165 and intersects @xmath132 only along the ( straight , horizontal ) image of the radial segment to @xmath162 and @xmath138 only along the ( horizontal ) image of the circumferential arc .",
    "similarly , from [ weimap ] one may readily check monotonicity of @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 on the boundary curves of @xmath33 in order to establish that the boundary has image contained in the wedge @xmath169 .",
    "moreover , [ weimap ] reveals that in @xmath33 @xmath170 = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that another application of the maximum principle ( to the harmonic coordinate functions @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 ,",
    "the last extended to the closure of @xmath33 ) establishes that the image of @xmath33 is contained in @xmath174 and intersects @xmath139 only along the image of the radial segment to @xmath24 and @xmath140 only along the image of the radial segment to @xmath162 .    because of the symmetries it therefore suffices to show that the enneper - weierstrass parametrization restricts to @xmath33 as an embedding . to this end",
    "observe first that each level curve of @xmath172 in @xmath33 is connected .",
    "indeed one can verify that @xmath167 vanishes nowhere on @xmath33 and has norm ( relative to @xmath175 ) tending to infinity at @xmath162 , so @xmath176 defines a smooth vector field on the closure of @xmath33 . the corresponding flow for time @xmath177 , when it exists , maps points ( other than the fixed point @xmath162 ) with @xmath178 to points with @xmath179 . examining the field at the boundary , one can check that the backward flow of a point in @xmath33 exits @xmath33 only after it reaches the segment joining @xmath126 and @xmath162 , while the forward flow leaves @xmath33 only through the real boundary segment .",
    "thus , if the flow for time @xmath180 of a point @xmath23 on the real segment from @xmath126 to @xmath24 lies in @xmath33 , then the flow for time @xmath177 of any real point to the right of @xmath23 will also lie in @xmath33 .",
    "now given @xmath181 with @xmath182 , the flow for time @xmath183 takes each point to a point on the real segment of @xmath33 ( since by the maximum principle and earlier monotonicity arguments this segment is the entirety of the @xmath184 curve in @xmath33 ) . by the previous considerations the flow for time @xmath185 exists for every point on the real segment joining these points , so , the flow for time @xmath185 being a continuous function of the initial point , we get a level @xmath178 path joining @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "now suppose there exist points @xmath181 such that @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "then there is a path contained in a single level curve of @xmath172 joining @xmath186 and @xmath187 , and , if @xmath186 and @xmath187 are distinct , by the mean value theorem there exists a third point @xmath190 between @xmath186 and @xmath187 on this path at which @xmath166 vanishes along the path .",
    "thus at @xmath190 the gradients @xmath191 and @xmath192 must be parallel .",
    "one finds from [ weimap ] that these gradients are parallel only on the circular boundary of @xmath33 , where they are tangential to the boundary , and therefore they are endpoints of level curves , so that we may assume @xmath190 is not such a point . thus we conclude that @xmath193 , showing not only that the enneper - weierstrass parametrization is an embedding but also that its image of the unit disc is actually a graph over a region in the @xmath132 plane .",
    "now we prove ( viii ) .",
