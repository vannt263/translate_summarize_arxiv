    "calculated results for different levels of interfacial electrification are shown in fig .  [ coverage - voltage ] .    upon increasing the voltage , we observe the expected decrease in the surface coverage due to the increasingly positive surface charge . however , the nature of this transition is strongly affected by surface electrification . for a system with a double - layer capacitance of 0 @xmath1f/@xmath2 ( that is , in the absence of surface charging ) , a region of high hydrogen coverage ( @xmath77125% )",

    "<S> pseudocapacitors are energy - storage devices characterized by fast and reversible redox reactions that enable them to store large amounts of electrical energy at high rates . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate the response of pseudocapacitive electrodes under realistic conditions to identify the microscopic factors that determine their performance , focusing on ruthenia ( ruo@xmath0 ) as a prototypical electrode material . </S>",
    "<S> electronic - structure methods are used together with a self - consistent continuum solvation model to build a complete database of free energies as the surface of the charged electrode is gradually covered with protons under applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting database is exploited to compute hydrogen - adsorption isotherms and charge  </S>",
    "<S> voltage responses by means of grand - canonical sampling , finding close agreement with experimental voltammetry . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations reveal that small changes on the order of 5 @xmath1f/@xmath2 in the intrinsic double - layer capacitance of the electrode  </S>",
    "<S> electrolyte interface can induce variations of up to 40 @xmath1f/@xmath2 in the overall pseudocapacitance . </S>"
