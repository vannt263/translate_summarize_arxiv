    "interest has been raised in recent years in the prospects of inferring the neutron - star mass and radius from thermonuclear bursts .",

    "eddington luminosity , and the distance , confidence limits on the mass and radius of several neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) has been estimated ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "each of these quantities is challenging to measure alone , but particularly substantial systematic errors are known to affect the blackbody normalisation . the normalisation can rise or fall steadily throughout the burst tail , depending roughly on the duration of the burst @xcite . furthermore , in some sources different bursts provide significantly different normalisation values .",
    "@xcite quantified some of these effects at the 37% level , although in an earlier analysis of the burst source exo  1745@xmath0248 found apparent radii measured from two bursts varying by 11% @xcite .",
    "additionally , analysis of bursts from another globular cluster source , 4u  1724@xmath0307 , found blackbody normalisations which varied by a factor of @xmath2 ( i.e. a 40% variation in the inferred radius ) between short- and long - duration bursts @xcite .",
    "independent of the issues for measurement , are uncertainties about precisely how the neutron star s atmosphere affects the emerging radiation . although the burst spectra are typically found observationally to be consistent with a blackbody ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , scattering effects have long been understood to distort the spectrum sufficiently to bias the measured temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this distortion is usually parameterised via a spectral distortion factor @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the measured blackbody ( or colour ) temperature , and @xmath5 is the effective temperature of the atmosphere .",
    "most recent work adopt a narrow range of @xmath61.4 at burst luminosities well below the eddington limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and often neglect the variations in @xmath1 that may arise during the burst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a more rigorous approach involves fitting the observed variation in the blackbody normalisation ( in response to the changing @xmath1 ) as a function of flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the predicted model curves can not yet reproduce the range of observed behaviour .",
    "samples of bursts accumulated from individual sources can be extremely heterogeneous in their properties . from low - duty cycle observations featuring gaps due to earth occultations and other conditions",
    ", it is usually impossible to be confident about the burst recurrence time , in which case the detailed ignition conditions , fuel composition , and even the completeness of thermonuclear burning are also uncertain . under such conditions , it is difficult to disentangle the various systematic influences which might influence the normalisation measurements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here we investigate the intrinsic reproducability of burst normalisation measurements using a uniform , homogeneous sample of bursts , from the low - mass x - ray binaries gs  1826@xmath024  and ks  1731@xmath026 .",
    "we use _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) proportional counter array ( pca ) data to test for intrinsic systematic effects which might influence burst normalisation measurements beyond any additional effects which might arise from variations in the ignition conditions and fuel composition . in a related paper , @xcite ( submitted to apj ; hereafter z11 ) used the same data to infer the mass and radius of gs  1826@xmath024 .",
    "few bursting sources exhibit trains of bursts with consistent lightcurves or recurrence times .",
    "the best known example is gs  1826@xmath024 , so far unique for its consistently regular burst behaviour , and high degree of uniformity between successive burst lightcurves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "comparison of the burst behaviour and lightcurves suggest that the system accretes mixed helium and hydrogen at roughly solar mass fraction @xcite .",
    "we used observations of gs  1826@xmath024  taken with the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , from the catalogue of bursts detected over the mission lifetime ( @xcite ; hereafter g08 ) .",
    "the flux - recurrence time relationship for this sample has been extensively studied by @xcite .",
    "optical photometry of the mass donor suggests an orbital period of 2.25  hr @xcite",
    ". however , several alias peaks are present in the periodogram , and it is possible one of these ( particularly at 2.05  hr ) represents the true orbital period .",
    "we performed a search of the g08 sample for additional examples of regular , consistent bursts .",
    "recurrence time provides the most obvious way to detect regular bursts , although for instruments in low - earth orbit like _ rxte _ , recurrence time measurement is confounded by regular interruptions due to occultations of the star by the earth .",
    "an alternative approach is to test for consistency of the burst light curve , via commonly - used parameters measuring the duration .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 of the fluence @xmath8 to the peak flux , as used by g08 , provides a simple way of comparing light curves .",
    "a scatter plot of @xmath7 against @xmath8 for a source with consistent bursts , will show strong clustering , and ks  1731@xmath026  provides the next best example after gs  1826@xmath024 .",

    "despite this , little attention has been directed at the burst behaviour of this system .",
    "one reason is that , unlike gs  1826@xmath024 , ks  1731@xmath026 exhibits both radius - expansion bursts , and burst oscillations @xcite ; previous analyses have focussed largely on these phenomena .",
    "a series of _ rxte _ observations of ks  1731@xmath026 were made in 2000 august and september , detecting a total of 14 bursts with highly consistent lightcurves .",
    "wfc observations also made during this time show that the burst behaviour was quite regular , with recurrence times of between 23  hr .",
    "an additional example , with a lightcurve very similar to those observed in 2000 , was detected on 1999 aug 26 . soon after the 2000 observations , the source faded to quiescence , and has not been active since @xcite .",
    "no other sources exhibit clustering as tight in the rest of the g08 sample ; the next best examples are 4u  1323@xmath062 and 4u  0836@xmath0429 .",
    "4u  1323@xmath062 is quite well - known for it s regular burst behaviour ( e.g. g08 ) , and in the _ rxte _ sample , many of the bursts were long with @xmath9  s and similar fluences , of @xmath10 .",
    "however , several of the bursts were closely followed by weaker events only a few minutes after the first .",
    "this behaviour has been observed in a number of systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is thought to arise from delayed ignition of material left over from the initial burst .",

    "time - resolved spectra in the range 260  kev covering the burst duration were extracted on intervals as short as 0.25  s during the burst rise and peak , with the bin size increasing gradually into the burst tail to maintain roughly the same signal - to - noise level . a spectrum taken from a 16-s interval prior to the burst",
    "was adopted as the background .",
    "we re - fit the spectra over the energy range 2.520  kev using the revised pca response matrices , v11.7 and adopted the recommended systematic error of 0.5% .",

    "this has a negligible effect on the fluxes , but can introduce spurious burst - to - burst variations in the blackbody normalisation .",
    "we also computed averaged lightcurves of blackbody spectral parameters for subsets of bursts from gs  1826@xmath024 , following the procedure adopted by @xcite .",
    "we first explored a variety of different approaches to measuring the blackbody normalisation in the tail of the bursts .",
    "we used an event from gs  1826@xmath024 on 2000 july 1 17:16:37 ( # 12 in g08 ) .",
    "four of five pcus ( 03 ) were functioning for this burst .",
    "we took the approach of iteratively determining the maximum extent in the tail ( beginning from a few seconds after the burst start ) over which a constant fit to the blackbody normalisations was an acceptable fit to below @xmath16 confidence .",

    "we froze the neutral column density at the same value as used for the individual spectral fits , @xmath26 .",
    "we linked the blackbody normalisation for each of the individual spectra but allowed the blackbody temperatures to vary . with this treatment , the fitted @xmath27",
    "was found over a shorter time interval , between 11.532.25  s following the burst start , and at a 3% higher value of @xmath23 ( table [ approaches ] ) .",
    "likely , the higher value is attained by omitting some of the spectra in the range 4060  s , when there is a noticeable downward trend in the normalisation ( fig .",
    "[ example ] ) .",
    "we note that the mean of the normalisation values over the reduced extent of the burst permitted by the joint fits , returns a consistent best - fit value , of @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that the two treatments returned a different extent of the burst tail over which the normalisation was constant may be attributed to the degree of goodness of fit of the individual spectra .",
    "the distribution of @xmath29 for the individual fits in the time range 3.062.5  s following the burst start is shown in fig .",
    "[ chidist ] . compared to the expected distribution",
    "given the number of degrees of freedom ( 22 ) , the observed distribution is skewed significantly to higher values of @xmath29 .",
    "this result suggests that residual systematic errors ( either instrumental , or possibly from deviations from a blackbody ) prevented a joint fit to the same confidence level extending over the same extent of the burst tail , compared to the simple average .",
    "we also explored the effect of the time binning approach on the results , by repeating the two analyses on data which used uniform 0.25  s bins throughout the burst .",
    "the bin sizes for the g08 data were 0.25-s from the start of the burst through to 14.5  s after the start , 0.5  s to 24.5  s , 1  s to 43.25  s , and 2  s through to 65.25  s. we found that the @xmath17 value obtained with uniform 0.25-s bins was identical to that with bins of variable size , although the extent of the constant fit was slightly less ( extending to 50.75  s instead of 65.25  s ; table [ approaches ] ) .",
    "similarly , the joint fit to the uniform 0.25-s binned spectra gave a comparable result to the joint fit for variable bins , and over roughly the same extent of the burst .",
    "the @xmath29 distribution for the 0.25  s - binned data over the range 3.2550.75  s after the burst start was similarly discrepant from the expected distribution assuming a statistically good fit , but at a lower confidence level ( k - s statistic of 0.12 , equivalent to @xmath30 ) .",
    "the _ rxte _ pcus are subject to a short ( @xmath31 ) interval of inactivity following the detection of each x - ray photon .",
    "this `` deadtime '' reduces the detected count rate below what is incident on the detector ( by approximately 3% for an incident rate of 400  count  s@xmath32 ) . for gs  1826@xmath024 ,",
    "the bursts peak at @xmath33  count  s@xmath32 , giving a peak deadtime rate of @xmath34% ( reducing in the burst tail to @xmath35% after @xmath36  s ) .",
    "since the bursts reach approximately the same peak flux , the deadtime correction is also approximately the same , and can be neglected for comparison purposes ( we similarly neglect any issues related to the absolute pca calibration ) . however , since the deadtime correction varies with time , it might also be expected to result in a slightly different evolution of the normalisation throughout the burst . to test this possibility",
    ", we examined the duration of the consant interval for the burst analysed in this section ( # 12 from g08 ) , with and without the deatime correction .",
    "although we measured an increase in the average normalisation with the deadtime correction , as expected , we found no change in the extent over which the normalisation was found to be constant .",
    "thus , we neglect deadtime corrections for the remainder of the analysis in this paper .",
    "we analysed 67 bursts observed from gs  1826@xmath024 by _ rxte _ between 1997 and 2007 .",
    "this sample includes the set of 58 complete bursts in g08 , excluding seven events for which the full lightcurve was not observed , or for which no appropriate data modes were available for the analysis , and one event which occurred during a slew and for which the burst flux could not be determined correctly .",
    "we also analysed an additional 9 bursts from observations in 2006 august , which were not part of the g08 sample .",
    "we compared the results of the joint fits @xmath27 with the average of the individual fits @xmath17 for the bursts from this sample to determine how the results from our sensitivity tests translated to a larger sample .",
    "although in some cases the joint fit durations were shorter than the constant fit duration for the individual normalisations the median duration was 94% of the average interval .",
    "furthermore , we found no systematic difference between the normalisations determined by the two methods , and the agreement was at better than 2% for 76% of the measurements ( maximum deviation was 8.5% ) .",
    "this compares favourably to the typical @xmath37 statistical uncertainty on the measurements , of 1% .",
    "thus , we conclude that the parameter averages @xmath38 provide an unbiased measure of the blackbody normalisation in the tail of these bursts , and adopt that method for further analysis",
    ".    the @xmath17 for the bursts from gs  1826@xmath024  determined from the individual spectral fit parameters ( using the spectra with variable binsizes ; see  [ sec1 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ history ] .",
    "the typical span of the constant fit was from @xmath39  s after the burst start ( 52% of the bursts ) to approximately 60  s. for one burst the normalisation was found to be constant from 277  s after the start of the burst ; the median duration was 48  s. over the interval during which the blackbody normalisation was constant , the blackbody temperature typically decreased from 2.3 to 1.6  kev , while the flux decreased from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath17 values were not significantly correlated with either the duration over which the average was calculated , nor the maximum time out to which the average was calculated .",
    "interestingly , the earliest time to which the constant fits could be extended ( @xmath423  s after the burst start ) was within the @xmath43  s burst rise . for several of the bursts ,",
    "the time at which the normalisation reaches the mean value corresponds approximately to a change in slope of the burst rise , seen in several of the bursts ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ example ] ) .",
    "this feature is similar to the `` bump '' seen in model lightcurves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although in the simulations this feature must arise due to some variation in the rate of increase of thermonuclear energy production ( as the 1-d models can not account for lateral propagation ) , the coincidence of the observed change in slope with the normalisation achieving its mean value suggests that this point marks where the effects of spreading cease .",
    "further analysis of the detailed shape of the burst rises may help to clarify this situation .",
    "we found significant variations in the mean normalisation @xmath17 , both between and within different observational epochs .",
    "for the bursts within each epoch ( 19978 and 20007 ) , the normalisation varied by 5 and 4% , respectively .",
    "this variation was highly significant ; the @xmath29 values for constant fits were 218 ( for 6 degrees of freedom ) and 1007 ( for 59 degrees of freedom ) , respectively . in terms of the inferred radius , this implies systematic uncertainties of order 22.5% .",
    "additionally , a much larger variation was measured between the two epochs .",
    "the first seven bursts , observed between 1997 november and 1998 june , had @xmath17 values substantially larger than the remaining bursts ( observed from 2000 june onwards ) .",
    "the mean and standard deviation for the normalisations of the 1997 - 8 bursts was @xmath44 while for subsequent bursts was @xmath45 .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test confirms that these distributions are discrepant at the @xmath46 significance level ( equivalent to @xmath47 ) .",
    "this variation was also noted by @xcite , who reported instead a correlation between the persistent flux and the blackbody normalisation for a subset of the bursts analysed here .    the observed variation is unlikely to arise from any instrumental effect , as the pca is precisely calibrated to maintain stable flux measurements for calibration sources over the entire mission lifetime . as we discuss below",
    ", the discrepancy is also unlikely to result from variations in the neutral column density @xmath13 as a function of epoch .",
    "closer examination of the spectral variation in the two groups of bursts provides a possible explanation .",
    "in contrast with the example burst discussed in the previous section , and other bursts observed in 20007 , the constant fit interval for the bursts observed in 19978 began later than in the 20007 bursts ; typically 10  s after the burst start for the 19978 bursts , compared to 3  s after the burst start for the other bursts .",
    "to put this another way , there was additional variation in the blackbody normalisation during the burst rise for the 19978 bursts that prevented extension of the constant interval to the same point as in the later bursts .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ epoch ] , which compares the blackbody normalisation averaged over the 19978 bursts with that of the 20007 bursts .",
    "remarkably , however , the behaviour of the normalisation in the two groups of bursts is virtually identical during the burst rise ; the discrepancy sets in from 10  s after the burst start , with the normalisation of the 19978 bursts gradually increasing over another @xmath48  s to a higher level .",
    "_ rxte _ observations of ks  1731@xmath026  in 2000 august ",
    "september detected 14 bursts , 8 in august and 6 in september ( these are bursts # 1421 and 2227 in g08 , respectively ) .",
    "although the _ rxte_/pca observations were interrupted regularly due to the satellite orbit and other scheduled observations , the times of the detected bursts were consistent with a regular recurrence time .",
    "the shortest burst separation measured by _ rxte _ during each month of data was @xmath49  hr ; the longer separations were consistent with integer multiples of this value , indicating regular bursts where intervening events were missed within data gaps .",
    "we measured the average recurrence times based on linear fits to the burst arrival times measured by _",
    "rxte _ , as @xmath50  hr and @xmath51  hr for august and september , respectively",
    ". one further burst , observed on 1999 aug 26 ( # 13 in g08 ) , exhibited a lightcurve consistent with the 14 observed in 2000 , and we included it in this sample .",
    "the regular bursts featured similar long ( @xmath43  s ) rises and decays ( @xmath36  s ) as those typically observed from gs  1826@xmath024 ( fig .",
    "[ lightcurves ] ) .",
    "the peak count rate was @xmath52  count  s@xmath53  pcu@xmath53 , so that deadtime corrections are comparable to those of gs  1826@xmath024  ( see  [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "however , the recurrence time for the bursts from ks  1731@xmath026 , at @xmath54  hr , were significantly shorter than has been observed from gs  1826@xmath024 in years of _ rxte _ observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . based on the assumed distances for the two sources ( 6  kpc for gs  1826@xmath024 and 7.2  kpc for ks  1731@xmath026 ; see g08 ) , the bursts from ks  1731@xmath026 reached significantly higher luminosities of ( 1.8@xmath55 , and the burst durations were also significantly shorter ( @xmath56  s compared with @xmath57  s for gs  1826@xmath024 ) . a shorter burst duration for ks  1731@xmath026  suggests a smaller fraction of hydrogen in the burst fuel , although the shorter recurrence time also allows less hydrogen to be consumed by steady burning prior to the burst .    as with gs  1826@xmath024 , we measured the best - fit normalisation @xmath17 from the time - resolved blackbody spectral fits over the longest possible time interval without exceeding the @xmath16 confidence limit .",
    "with the shorter bursts from ks  1731@xmath026 , the constant @xmath18 fits extended typically over the range 230  s after the burst start . over this time interval ,",
    "the blackbody temperature dropped ( typically ) from 2.5 to 1.8  kev , with the flux dropping from @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "the fitted @xmath17 values of the long bursts from ks  1731@xmath026exhibited significant variability ; a fit with a constant model gave a @xmath60 for 14 degrees of freedom , indicating variability at the @xmath61 level .",
    "the mean value was @xmath62 , with standard deviation between the various measurements of 2.6% .",
    "the mean blackbody normalisation of the burst on 1999 aug 26 , measured between 1.2536  s after the burst start at @xmath63  ( km/@xmath64 , was fully consistent with the bursts observed in 2000 despite being observed a year earlier .    in an independent analysis of the bursts observed from ks  1731@xmath026  with _ rxte _ (",
    "of which the bursts we analyse here are a subset ) , @xcite measured a mean blackbody normalisation of @xmath65 , and found weakly significant variation in the normalisation as a function of the burst flux .",
    "although this value is not significantly different from the normalisation we derive from the subset of bursts analysed here , we suggest that the difference arises from a systematic effect due to the value adopted for the neutral column density . for the analysis presented here",
    ", we assumed @xmath66 ( from multi - epoch _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectra of the source during quiescence ; @xcite ) while @xcite adopted a value of @xmath67 , the mean of best - fit values from fits to the burst spectra measured by _",
    "rxte_. for a simulated blackbody spectrum with known @xmath68 and normalisation , adopting a realistic model for the pre - burst emission as background , the fitted value of the normalisation depends linearly on the assumed @xmath13 ( fig .",

    "we found that the variation within epochs was 45% ( 2.6% ) for gs  1826@xmath024  ( ks  1731@xmath026 ) , while the variation between epochs can be as large as 17% ( for gs  1826@xmath024 ) . in terms of inferred radius",
    ", this corresponds to variations of 22.5% ( 1.3% ) and 8% .",
    "the variation within each epoch is within the range reported by @xcite in their more comprehensive study of bursts from several sources , although the 8% variation between epochs observed for gs  1826@xmath024  is somewhat larger .",
    "we stress that this uncertainty is solely related to the measurement of the blackbody normalisation in bursts , and ( as suggested by z11 ) may be exceeded by other sources of uncertainty , for example the degree of anisotropy of burst emission .",
    "the 19978 bursts from gs  1826@xmath024 , which exhibited longer recurrence times and reached slightly higher fluxes , also exhibited larger mean normalisations @xmath17 .",
    "comparison of the normalisation time - series averaged over subsamples of bursts from the two epochs show that the normalisations were essentially identical during the burst rise and through the burst peak , with deviations becoming apparent between 1020  s after the burst start .",
    "the reproducibility of the @xmath18 evolution throughout the burst rise and peak suggests that the system geometry , atmospheric composition and temperature ( and hence @xmath1 ) were essentially identical over that interval , and whatever physical condition gave rise to the elevated @xmath18 in the 19978 bursts set in after the burst peak .",
    "we consider three possible mechanisms to give rise to the variation .",
    "first , it may be that the amount of neutral material close to the neutron star was reduced , so that the neutral column density @xmath13 decreased during the 19978 bursts , leading to an overestimation of @xmath18 ( see e.g. fig . [ nh_sens ] ) .",
    "simulations adopting the pre - burst emission from gs  1826@xmath024  ( as was done for ks  1731@xmath026 ; see  [ s1731 ] ) indicate that in order to overestimate the @xmath17 by the required amount would necessitate decreasing the total @xmath13 value by @xmath72 . since this value is almost five times the assumed line - of - sight value for gs  1826@xmath024 , we can rule out this mechanism .",
    "second , it is possible that the degree of anisotropy of the burst emission changed in reponse to a variation in the accretion geometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , perhaps triggered by the burst .",
    "such a change might be expected to be reflected in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the broadband ( @xmath42100  kev ) spectral distribution of the persistent emission in gs  1826@xmath024  has been well studied by @xcite , in the context of determining the best possible estimate of the bolometric flux ( and hence the accretion rate ) .",
    "those authors found substantial changes in the spectrum with epoch , most notably during 2003 april , when evidence for an additional soft ( @xmath73  kev ) component was found .",
    "however , the mean normalisation from the 6 bursts observed in 2003 april was @xmath74 ( see fig . [ history ] ) , fully consistent with the mean from the other bursts from 2000 onwards ( but excluding the 2003 april bursts ) , of @xmath75 .",
    "conversely , there is no evidence for a substantially different x - ray spectrum during the 19978 observations ( see @xcite , fig .",
    "4 ) the lack of correspondence between the broadband spectral shape and the blackbody normalisation from the bursts seems to contraindicate an influence of the burst anisotropy on the normalisation , although can not rule it out . on the other hand ,",
    "the variations in the persistent x - ray spectrum might be transient , present only when the elevated @xmath18 values were measured , beginning 10  s after the burst start .",
    "such variations might be expected to lead to incorrect pre - burst emission subtraction later in the burst , although this is not observed consistently .",
    "third , we consider the possibility that the @xmath1 value changes to produce the variation in the measured @xmath18 after the peak in the 19978 bursts from gs  1826@xmath024 .",
    "modelling studies indicate that @xmath1 depends on fixed parameters such as the neutron star surface gravity , but also the composition and effective temperature of the scattering atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is evidence in other sources that radius - expansion bursts can remove the outer , h - rich layers of the photosphere , leading to a change in the atmospheric composition during the burst @xcite ; no such effects have been suggested from non - radius expansion bursts . nevertheless , interpreting the maximum variation in @xmath17 in the 19978 bursts , compared to the mean for the 20007 bursts , as a variation in @xmath1 implies a maximum variation of 12% ( 8% in the mean ) .",
    "this result suggests that the assumption that @xmath1 is constant during bursts is not always true . while @xcite predict patterns of variation of @xmath1 with burst flux , the epoch - to - epoch differences in the burst lightcurves in gs  1826@xmath024  are relatively subtle , and do not appear sufficient to give rise to the inferred variation in @xmath1 .",
    "it is possible that the peak blackbody flux ( or temperature ) serves as the discriminant which results in elevated blackbody normalisations later in the burst .",
    "the 19978 bursts reached maximum fluxes about 8% higher on average than for the 20007 bursts .",
    "the discrepancy in the maximum temperature reached was proportionately smaller .",
    "the samples of bursts studied here were deliberately selected for the consistency of their lightcurves and regularity of their recurrence times .",
    "for other samples of bursts , which are typically much more heterogeneous , systematic errors in measurements of the blackbody radius of order @xmath76% should be assumed , unless the variation in @xmath1 can be modelled .",
    "the mean blackbody normalisations measured during the later ( 20007 ) bursts from gs  1826@xmath024 , and the regular bursts from ks  1731@xmath026 , were consistent with a constant value over several tens of seconds .",
    "this constancy was observed independent of the specific method for determining the mean value , although the choice of method can introduce small biases .",
    "in particular , comparisons of joint fits to the spectra with averages of the fitted normalisations show that in general the former method arrives at shorter durations for the constant normalisation , likely because the spectra are not ( en masse ) statistically consistent with blackbodies .",
    "trends in the blackbody normalisation late in the burst tail , coupled with these marginally deviant spectra , likely give rise to systematic errors of a few percent between the two methods . the choice of time binning strategy does not have as large an effect .",
    "this constancy of the blackbody normalisation was maintained despite significant decreases in the blackbody temperature , of ( typically ) 30% , and decreases in the flux of 6075% over the same time interval .",
    "such a lack of variation in the blackbody normalisation implies constraints on the relative degree of spectral distortion over this temperature range , suggesting one of two situations .",
    "either , any variation in in the spectral distortion factor @xmath1 as a result of the varying effective temperature ( as indicated by the decreasing blackbody temperature ) is _ exactly balanced _ by some other variation , e.g. a change in the emitting radius as the burst flux decreases ; or , that the color temperature correction @xmath1 is also constant throughout the interval in which @xmath18 is constant .",
    "the former explanation is rather contrived , particularly considering that in the burst tail the burning front is expected to have already spread to the entire surface area of the neutron star , and no further increase ( or decrease ) in burning area is expected .",
    "thus , these measurements suggest that for the range of effective temperatures spanned in the burst tails , the color - temperature correction @xmath1 is roughly constant .",
    "this conclusion is difficult to reconcile with the predictions of atmosphere models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicate significant variations in @xmath1 over most of the flux range spanned during the burst .",
    "the distance for gs  1826@xmath024  is thought to be @xmath34  kpc @xcite , at which an eddington - limited burst would be expected to reach @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) @xmath79 for an h - rich ( pure he ) atmosphere ( e.g. g08 ) .",
    "this would imply that the range of flux over which the burst normalisation is found to be constant is 0.160.75 ( 0.100.46 )  @xmath80 .",
    "the greatest variation in the normalisation predicted by @xcite is outside these ranges , although significant variations would yet be expected ( particularly for the solar metallicity models ; see also z11 ) .",
    "the @xmath815% fractional variation in @xmath82 observed from gs  1826@xmath024  and ks  1731@xmath026  within each observational epoch was smaller than that seen in two radius - expansion bursts observed from exo  1745@xmath0248 , of 25% @xcite .",
    "this observation perhaps suggests an explanation of the variation .",
    "exo  1745@xmath0248 exhibited during it s 2000 outburst an initial period of strong variability , reminiscent of dipping behaviour observed in high - inclination systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "no such variability has ever been observed from gs  1826@xmath024  or ks  1731@xmath026 , suggesting that perhaps the inclination is lower in those systems than in exo  1745@xmath0248 . if system inclination is the main factor in determining the variation in apparent blackbody normalisation , a possible explanation is the reprocessing of some fraction of the burst flux off an accretion disk whose projected area varies with time . in 4u  1728@xmath034 ,",
    "the timescale inferred for the variation was several tens of days @xcite , much longer than the expected orbital period of this system ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , in gs  1826@xmath024  and ks  1731@xmath026 , the variation is on a much shorter timescale , comparable to the recurrence time of the bursts themselves ( hours ) . for comparison ,",
    "the discrepant bursts from exo  1745@xmath0248 were separated by 8.5  d. we note that such an explanation fails to account for the factor of @xmath2 difference in normalisation in the bursts from 4u  1724@xmath0307 @xcite , which does not show dips and thus is unlikely to be at high inclination .",
    "however , those bursts also exhibited markedly different timescales , indicative of a varying accumulated fuel reservoir at ignition ; we suggest instead that different physical conditions ( temperature , composition ) gave rise to the difference in the measured blackbody normalisation .",
    "the shorter timescale of variation in @xmath17 for gs  1826@xmath024  and ks  1731@xmath026  suggests that there may be an orbital component of the variation .",
    "the specific value of the blackbody normalisation depends upon the assumed neutral column density , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nh_sens ] .",
    "thus , an orbital variation in the line - of - sight column density , perhaps arising from cool clouds of material above the point of contact of the accretion stream with the disk , will manifest as a variation in the blackbody normalisation on the same timescale . in order to test this hypothesis , we calculated a lomb - normalised periodogram on the blackbody normalisation measurements as a function of time .",
    "recall the orbital period in both sources is unknown , but for gs  1826@xmath024  is thought to be around 2  hr ; based on the typical orbital periods for other burst sources , we searched a frequency range of 0.524  hr . for gs  1826@xmath024 , we divided the measurements from the two epochs through by the appropriate mean , and found a peak lomb power of 10.48 ; for ks  1731@xmath026 , we found a peak lomb power of 5.29 .",
    "neither of these detections is significant . for ks  1731@xmath026",
    ", the known sensitivity of the normalisation measurement to discrepancies between the assumed and true value of @xmath13 indicates that a variation of @xmath83 in @xmath13 could account for the variation in the measured blackbody normalisation . for gs  1826@xmath024 ,",
    "the measurements are slightly more sensitive to discrepancies in @xmath13 , so that a variation in @xmath13 of @xmath84 could account for the variation in the blackbody normalisation within each epoch .",
    "if orbital or longer - timescale variations in @xmath13 are driving the variation in the blackbody normalisation , it may be possible to verify through time - resolved high - spectral resolution measurements of absorption edges in the x - ray spectra .",
