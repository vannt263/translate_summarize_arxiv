    "most of our understanding of many - body quantum systems is anchored in the concept of ( quasi)particles . starting from free constituents obeying either fermionic or bosonic statistics , one builds a many - body ground state as either a fermi sea or a bose - einstein condensate . in two or three dimensions , interactions then ` adiabatically",
