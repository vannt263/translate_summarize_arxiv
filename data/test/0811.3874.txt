    "in addition to charge and spin , future electronic devices may also manipulate the non - local correlations allowed by quantum mechanics , known as entanglement .",
    "for instance a superconductor may be used as a source of einstein podolsky rosen pairs of electrons @xcite . local andreev reflection @xcite at a normal metal - superconductor ( ns ) interface is a process by which a spin - up electron incoming from the normal side is reflected as a spin - down hole while a pair is transferred into the superconductor : pairs of electrons penetrate the superconductor for an applied bias smaller than the gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : carec]a ) . for an opposite applied voltage , the superconductor s emits correlated pairs of electrons into the normal metal n. andreev reflection takes place in a coherence volume of size @xmath0 , the characteristic length associated to the superconducting gap @xmath1 .",
    "two separate normal electrodes connected to a superconductor within a distance of order @xmath0 may thus be coupled by `` non - local '' or `` crossed '' andreev processes @xmath2 ( car , see fig .",
    "[ fig : carec]b ) . on the other hand",
    "another type of non - local process may take place .",
    "electrons can also tunnel across the superconductor from one normal electrode to the other .",
    "this normal tunneling has been called @xcite `` elastic cotunneling '' ( ec ) in analogy to similar processes taking place in coulomb blockaded quantum dots @xcite .     , width=264 ]    motivated by the possibility of creation of non - local coherent states by means of car processes",
    ", several experiments have been performed recently@xcite on superconducting structures connected to normal or ferromagnetic metallic electrodes .",
    "depending on the type of s / n interfaces , geometry and range of parameters , different behaviors of the non - local conductance or resistance have been observed .    according to lowest order perturbation theory @xcite in the tunnel amplitudes ,",
    "ec and car have the same transmission coefficient , once an average over the fermi wave - length scale or over disorder is carried out .",
    "since an opposite charge is transmitted by ec and car , it is deduced that the non - local conductance vanishes in this limit .",
    "a finite non - local signal may be restored by higher order tunneling processes@xcite or by coulomb interactions @xcite . moreover , out - of - equilibrium effects may play an important role on the non - local transport as was suggested in ref .   for a superconducting quantum dot and in ref .   for normal electrodes connected to a three dimensional superconductor .",
    "experimental data on the other hand are still not well understood .",
    "in particular the experiment of ref .   on a planar nisin structure ( where i stands for an insulating barrier )",
    "has provided unexpected experimental evidence for a non - local signal dominated either by ec or by car depending on the value of the applied bias . also importantly ,",
    "this experiment @xcite has shown a suppression of the non - local signal when an external magnetic field , much smaller than the critical one , was applied .",
    "other experiments on nsn hybrid structures provide evidence for charge imbalance effects as the voltage approaches the temperature - dependent gap value@xcite and in a temperature window close to the superconducting critical temperature@xcite .",
    "although non - local transport in sn structures has been addressed theoretically by several works in recent years , none of these provide a full self - consistent model for describing the superconducting order parameter , the current profile and the non - local conductance of the s region , as well as the magnetic field dependence of these quantities .",
    "to bridge this gap , we analyze here a nisin planar structure using a microscopic model which we solve self - consistently in order to obtain the current profile inside the superconductor in the presence of an applied voltage and magnetic field .",
    "to adequately represent a non - local transport measurement setup in the self - consistent calculation it is important to include additional superconducting leads which allow to remove from the sample the injected current ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ninss ] ) .",
    "this implies a substantial difference with conventional `` two terminal '' measurements , for which the current is the same on both leads .",
    "a two - terminal situation would be recovered by removing the superconducting leads .",
    "an important parameter characterizing an actual experimental situation is the value of the transparency for the barriers connecting the superconductor with the normal electrodes .",
    "although this parameter is difficult to be controlled in experiments the available data correspond to very different ranges as it was pointed out in ref .  .",
    "within our model it is possible to study non - local transport for arbitrary interface transparency , applied bias and external magnetic field .",
    "this allows us to analyze the crossover from a quasi - equilibrium situation at low barrier transparency to the case of strong non - equilibrium for high transparency and finite voltages . in agreement with previous works @xcite",
    ", we find that increasing barrier transparency leads to a dominance of ec over car transmission in the non - local conductance .",
    "we also show that an applied magnetic field does not modify the balance between ec and car .",
    "the value of the ec and car transmission coefficients increases upon application of voltage or magnetic field ( positive magneto - transmission ) . for simplicity",
    "we do not take into account in the present work the effect of coulomb interactions , although it has been realized that they can play an important role for the case of low barrier transparencies @xcite .",
    "we also restrict our analysis to the ballistic case at zero temperature .",
    "in addition to providing insight into the gap and current profiles in the superconducting region , our work demonstrates that a description of non - local transport in terms of linear relations involving the ec and car transmission coefficients only makes sense in a quasi - equilibrium situation when either the transparency of the s / n interfaces or the bias voltage is low .",
    "if the superconductor is driven far from the equilibrium situation this description breaks down , and the resulting non - local conductance and resistance deviate considerably from their values in equilibrium .",
    "this case corresponds to the experimental situation of ref .   where the non - local resistance was measured for currents close to the critical one . within our model",
    "we are able to obtain the observed change of sign of the non - local resistance as a function of the injected current@xcite .",

    "thus , the regions of negative differential conductance could not be explored . however , the regions with negative @xmath131 shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : desi ] would be observable , since the sign change of @xmath131 is related to the condition @xmath135 rather than to the change of sign of @xmath129 .",
    "in fact , we have checked that the change of sign of @xmath131 takes place outside the regions with negative @xmath129 .",
    "on @xmath136 , where @xmath77 is the dimension of the superconductor along @xmath96 axis , and @xmath0 is the bulk coherence length .",
    "the applied voltage is small compared to the gap ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the coherence length is larger than for the corresponding parameters that in the presence of superconducting leads .",
    "panel ( a ) corresponds to @xmath138 and panel ( b ) to @xmath139 .",

    "we have presented self - consistent model calculations for describing a typical experimental setup to measure non - local transport in nanoscale superconductors connected to normal electrodes .",
    "an important ingredient in these calculations is the inclusion of the superconducting leads which drain the current injected into the nanoscale region .",
    "we have found that this system exhibits a rich variety of behaviors controlled by several parameters .",
    "one can distinguish two limiting cases : the quasi - equilibrium regime in which the superconducting order parameter depends only weakly on the applied voltage and the strong non - equilibrium case where this dependence can not be neglected . in these two regimes",
    "the non - local conductance exhibits a quite different behavior . in quasi - equilibrium conditions",
    "@xmath123 can be expressed as the difference between @xmath107 and @xmath106 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath106 becomes larger than @xmath107 for increasing transparency , and that both decay exponentially with the system size @xmath77 .",
    "moreover we have shown that both coefficients increase under an applied magnetic field .    in the case of strong non - equilibrium a simple expression of @xmath123 as the difference between @xmath107 and @xmath106 is no longer possible .",
    "the voltage dependence of the self - consistent order parameter introduces an additional contribution to the non - local conductance .",
    "we have also found that even the local conductance can be strongly modified by non - equilibrium effects .",
    "the effects on these two quantities lead to a non - local resistance which may exhibit a strongly non - monotonous behavior as a function of the injected current including a sign change for sufficiently large transparency .    as a final remark we would like to comment the possible connection between the present model calculations and the existing experiments on non - local transport .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , basically three different experiments have been performed so far .",
    "they correspond to different geometries and to different materials .",
    "the size of the junctions transparency can also change enormously from one experiment to the other .",
    "it is thus not possible to infer general conclusions from these results . in the case of the experiment of ref .",
    "the authors claim to have junctions with a extremely small transparency @xmath140 which would warrant the quasi - equilibrium conditions in the subgap voltage range .",
    "the results of the present work , corresponding to a non - interacting theory , would not be able to describe that experiment .",
    "in particular our results predict an increase of the non - local conductance with magnetic field in contradiction with the experimental observations .",
    "as stated in a previous work by some of the authors @xcite , interactions mediated by the electromagnetic modes may play an important role in that experimental situation .",
    "it was also conjectured @xcite that disorder may play a role when associated to phase fluctuations .    on the other hand , the experimental results of ref .",
    "clearly correspond to the strong non - equilibrium situation described in the present work .",
    "even when our model geometry does not fully correspond the their experimental setup the behavior of the non - local resistance as a function of the injected current shown in fig.[fig : desi ] is very similar to the one found in this experiment .",
    "a closer comparison between theory and experiments would be desirable for further understanding of the observed features .",
