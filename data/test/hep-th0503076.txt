    "consistent unification of relativity and quantum mechanics remains an unsolved theoretical problem in spite of many efforts applied to its solution in the 20th century .",
    "the fundamental difference between relativistic and non - relativistic physics follows from the famous einstein s formula @xmath1 .",
    "this formula , in particular , implies that if a system of particles has sufficient energy @xmath2 of their relative motion , then this energy may be converted to the mass @xmath3 of newly created particles .",
    "generally , there is no limit on how many particles can be created in collisions , so any realistic quantum mechanical description of high - energy systems should involve states with any number of particles from zero to infinity . the number of particles is not conserved during time evolution .",
    "the most familiar example of such a behavior is the emission and absorption of light ( photons ) in electrodynamics .",
    "first attempts to describe relativistic quantum systems were undertaken immediately after creation of the formalism of quantum mechanics in 1920 s .",
    "a quantum theory of the electromagnetic field was constructed by quantization of the classical maxwell electrodynamics . in lowest perturbation orders ,",
    "this theory agreed well with experimental results . however , perturbative calculations for the @xmath0-matrix did not work in higher orders , in particular , due to ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the way to calculate the @xmath0-matrix in qft accurately in all orders was provided by the renormalized qed formulated by feynman , schwinger , and tomonaga in the late 1940 s .",
    "however this approach created a host of other problems . according to the prevailing interpretation , the creation and annihilation operators present in the hamiltonian and lagrangian of qed correspond to _ bare _ particles having infinite masses and charges .",
    "however , the bare particles have never been directly observed in experiments . they are believed to be surrounded by clouds of virtual photons and electron - positron pairs , thus forming complex objects called _ dressed _ particles .",
    "the dressed particles are supposed to be the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian .",
    "they have finite experimentally observable masses and charges .",
    "the problem is that the bare particle hamiltonian of qft is formally infinite .",
    "although , these infinities cancel out when the @xmath0-matrix is calculated , the hamiltonian is useless if one wants to calculate the time evolution or to find wavefunctions of bound states via diagonalization procedure .    two lines of research were initiated to cope with these problems .",
    "the _ dressed particle _",
    "approach was suggested by greenberg and schweber @xcite . their goal was to get rid of the bare particles and to express the entire formalism of qft through observable dressed particles only .",
    "the operators for dressed particles were sought as unitary transforms of bare particle operators . from another direction , gazek and",
    "wilson @xcite introduced the _ similarity renormalization _ formalism .",
    "the idea was to apply a unitary transformation to the hamiltonian in order to ensure that interaction potentials rapidly fall off as functions of energy differences , and to guarantee that all loop integrals are convergent .",
    "the similarity and dressing transformations are strikingly similar .",
    "they can be combined into one unitary _",
    "similarity - dressing _ transformation which achieves two goals at once : the theory can be expressed in terms of real dressed particles and the hamiltonian can be made finite in all perturbation orders . at the same time",
    ", the accurate and well - tested @xmath0-matrix of the renormalized theory remains intact .",
    "this combined approach was developed in refs . @xcite and dubbed the relativistic quantum dynamics , or rqd .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the reasons why the renormalization difficulties ( e.g. , the absence of a well - defined hamiltonian and unsatisfactory treatment of the time evolution ) persist in current relativistic quantum field theories . to avoid unnecessary mathematical complications",
    ", we will be working with a simple model theory which , nevertheless , shares some important features with qed . in section 9 we will explain how the similarity - dressing transformation of this model theory leads to a well defined ( perturbatively ) finite hamiltonian that can be used for all kinds of quantum mechanical calculations ( @xmath0-matrix , bound states , time evolution , etc . ) without the need for renormalization .",
    "in addition , the rqd formalism does not use the dubious notions of bare and virtual particles .",
    "in this paper we will be concerned with three types of phenomena that are normally studied in physical experiments : bound states , time evolution , and scattering .",
    "these three areas account for the most of experimental information available about fundamental particles and their interactions .",
    "the key theoretical quantity involved in quantum mechanical description of these phenomena is the hamilton operator @xmath4 .",
    "the energies @xmath5 and state vectors @xmath6 of bound states can be found as eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian    @xmath7    the development of the state vector @xmath8 from time @xmath9 to time @xmath10 is described by the _ time evolution operator _",
    "@xmath11    @xmath12    if the eigenvalues @xmath5 and eigenvectors @xmath13 of the hamiltonian are known and the initial state is represented as a sum ( and/or integral ) over the basis states    @xmath14    unfortunately , in most cases , the full spectrum of the hamiltonian is not known , and the time evolution is difficult to predict .",
    "this difficulty , however , is not that disappointing , because experimental observations of the time evolution in subatomic world are even more difficult than calculations .",
    "most experiments in high energy physics are performed by preparing free particles or their bound states ( like hydrogen atoms or deuterons ) , bringing them into collision , and studying the properties of free particles or bound states leaving the region of collision . in these experiments , it is not possible to observe the time evolution during interaction : particle reactions occur almost instantaneously and one can only register the reactants and products which move freely before and after the collision .",
    "this gives a lucky break for theoreticians : in such situations the theory is not required to describe the detailed dynamics of particles during the short interval of collision .",
    "it is sufficient to provide a mapping of free states before interaction onto the free states after the interaction . to describe scattering experiments",
    ", one needs only the formula for the time evolution from the remote past @xmath15 to the distant future @xmath16",
    "@xmath17    where the @xmath0__-operator _ _ [ s - oper ] is defined by    @xmath18    one can read the right hand side of eq .",

    "the most effective technique available for calculations of the @xmath0-operator is the perturbation theory which can be written in many equivalent forms .",
    "the dyson time - ordered expansion provides the most economical expressions that can be encoded in familiar feynman diagrams .",
    "however , for the discussion in this paper , we found more useful two other perturbative expressions which differ from the dyson s formula only by re - shuffling the terms .",
    "the `` old - fashioned '' formula for the @xmath0-operator is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the interaction part of the total hamiltonian @xmath22 ,    @xmath23    and the factor latexmath:[$e^{-\\epsilon    switching the interaction on and off .",

    "the @xmath0-operator represents only `` integrated '' time evolution from the remote past to the distant future .",
    "the knowledge of the @xmath0-operator is sufficient to calculate the scattering cross - sections as well as energies and lifetimes of stable and metastable bound states .-",

    "such hamiltonians @xmath4 and @xmath40 are called _ scattering - equivalent_. the energy spectra of two scattering equivalent hamiltonians are identical . however , the eigenvectors are different and , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:8.61a ] ) , the corresponding descriptions of dynamics are different as well",
    ". therefore scattering - equivalent theories may be not _ physically _ equivalent .",
    "calculations of bound states , time evolution and scattering is a routine practice in non - relativistic quantum mechanics . however , the situation is less certain in relativistic quantum field theories . as mentioned in introduction",
    ", the hamiltonian of renormalized qft is infinite .",
    "therefore , it is not immediately clear if the above formulas ( [ eq:1 ] ) - ( [ eq:8.74 ] ) remain valid for the high energy relativistic phenomena , and what modifications , if any , should be introduced in quantum theory to take into account the variable number of particles . in this paper",
    "we illustrate the difficulties encountered in quantum field theories by analyzing a simple model theory with variable number of particles . we will demonstrate that the hamiltonian can be redefined so that there is no need for renormalization and usual quantum mechanical techniques remain applicable even in the relativistic case .",

    "non - zero terms @xmath185 mean that the charge of the electron is modified by the interaction . actually , this modification is infinite , but even finite values of the terms like ( [ eq:11.58 ] ) are inconsistent with the classical limit .",

    "second , from the theoretical point of view , the traditional approach operates with notions of bare and virtual particles that are , in principle , non - observable .",
    "it is desirable to have a theory formulated directly in terms of dressed particles and their interactions without mentioning the non - observable bare and virtual particles at all .",
    "this idea was first realized in the dressed particle formalism by greenberg and schweber @xcite .    in the rest of this paper",
    "we will discuss the rqd approach @xcite which combines the similarity renormalization and dressed particle ideas .",
    "rqd is capable to fix the both problems of the traditional renormalization formalism mentioned above .",
    "let us first focus on the dressing part of rqd .",

    "the same is true for interactions in higher orders : the interaction operators @xmath220 off the energy shell remain undetermined by our condition ( a ) .",
    "this freedom in choosing interactions simply means that different choices of the coefficient functions of @xmath220 off the energy shell result in scattering equivalent hamiltonians . since our experimental knowledge about interactions in high energy physics is limited to their effects on scattering , we are allowed to freely choose the behavior of @xmath220 off the energy shell without any danger to get into contradiction with experiment .",

    "the loop integrals encountered in calculations of ( [ eq:12.10 ] ) could be divergent .",
    "in our case these integrals are convergent : when the loop integration momentum goes to infinity , the @xmath227 factors in the integrand go away from the energy shell , i.e. , rapidly fall off .",

    "this commutator depends on the behavior of @xmath244 everywhere in the momentum space .",
    "so , it substantially depends on our choice of @xmath245 off the energy shell .",
    "there is a great freedom in this choice which is reflected in the uncertainty of @xmath246 even on the energy shell .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the off - shell behavior of the 2nd order interaction and the on - shell behavior of the 4th order interaction can not be separately determined in our theory , they are connected to each other in such a way that the ambiguity of the interaction does not affect the @xmath0-matrix for the electron - electron scattering .",
    "the above construction does not allow us to obtain full information about @xmath216 : the off - shell behavior of interactions is rather arbitrary , and the on - shell behavior can be determined only for lowest order terms .",
