    "the sign of the velocity at @xmath12 determines whether characteristics of the hyperbolic transport equation @xmath13 enter the domain ( considering @xmath14 as a lower - order forcing term ) , and thus whether @xmath15 should be prescribed .",

    "these may be either of `` expansive '' type , resembling rarefaction wave solutions on the whole line , or `` compressive '' type , resembling viscous shock solutions .",
    "a fundamental question is whether or not such boundary layer solutions are _ stable _ in the sense of pde . for the expansive inflow case",
    ", it has been shown in @xcite that _ all _ boundary layers are stable , independent of amplitude , by energy estimates similar to those used to prove the corresponding result for rarefactions on the whole line . here , we concentrate on the complementary , _ compressive case _ ( though see discussion , section [ discussion ] ) .    linearized and nonlinear stability of general ( expansive or compressive ) _ small - amplitude _ noncharacteristic boundary layers of have been established in @xcite .",
    "more generally , it has been shown in @xcite that linearized and nonlinear stability are equivalent to spectral stability , or nonexistence of nonstable ( nonnegative real part ) eigenvalues of the linearized operator about the layer , for boundary layers of arbitrary amplitude .",
    "however , up to now the spectral stability of _ large - amplitude compressive _",
    "boundary layers has remained largely undetermined .",
    "we resolve this question in the present paper , carrying out a systematic , global study classifying the stability of all possible compressive boundary - layer solutions of .",
    "our method of analysis is by a combination of asymptotic ode techniques and numerical evans function computations , following a basic approach introduced recently in @xcite for the study of the closely related shock wave case . here",
    ", there are interesting complications associated with the richer class of boundary - layer solutions as compared to possible shock solutions , the delicate stability properties of the inflow case , and , in the outflow case , the nonstandard eigenvalue problem arising from reduction to lagrangian coordinates .",
    "our conclusions are , for both inflow and outflow conditions , that compressive boundary layers that are uniformly noncharacteristic in a sense to be made precise later ( specifically , @xmath25 bounded away from @xmath26 , in the terminology of section [ profsec ] ) are _ unconditionally stable _ , independent of amplitude , on the range @xmath27 $ ] considered in our numerical computations .",
    "we show by energy estimates that _ outflow boundary layers are stable also in the characteristic limit_. the omitted characteristic limit in the inflow case , analogous to the small - amplitude limit for the shock case should be treatable by the singular perturbation methods used in @xcite to treat the small - amplitude shock case ; however , we do not consider this case here .    in the inflow case , our results , together with those of @xcite ,",
    "completely resolve the question of stability of isentropic ( expansive or compressive ) uniformly noncharacteristic boundary layers for @xmath28 $ ] , yielding _ unconditional stability independent of amplitude or type .",
    "_ in the outflow case , we show stability of all compressive boundary layers without the assumption of uniform noncharacteristicity .",
    "the small - amplitude results obtained in @xcite are of `` general type '' , making little use of the specific structure of the equations .",
    "essentially , they all require that the difference between the boundary layer solution and its constant limit at @xmath29 be small in @xmath30 .",
    "be small in @xmath30 .",
    "( for monotone profiles , @xmath31 . ) ] as pointed out in @xcite , this is the `` gap lemma '' regime in which standard asymptotic ode estimates show that behavior is essentially governed by the limiting constant - coefficient equations at infinity , and thus stability may be concluded immediately from stability ( computable by exact solution ) of the constant layer identically equal to the limiting state .",
    "these methods do not suffice to treat either the ( small - amplitude ) characteristic limit or the large - amplitude case , which require more refined analyses .",
    "in particular , up to now , _ there was no analysis considering boundary layers approaching a full viscous shock profile _ , _ not even a profile of vanishingly small amplitude_.",
    "our analysis of this limit indicates why : the appearance of a small eigenvalue near zero prevents uniform estimates such as would be obtained by usual types of energy estimates .",
    "by contrast , the large - amplitude results obtained here and ( for expansive layers ) in @xcite make use of the specific form of the equations . in particular , both analyses make use of the advantageous structure in lagrangian coordinates . the possibility to work in lagrangian",
    "coordinates was first pointed out by matsumura ",
    "nishihara @xcite in the inflow case , for which the stationary boundary transforms to a moving boundary with constant speed . here",
    "we show how to convert the outflow problem also to lagrangian coordinates , by converting the resulting variable - speed boundary problem to a constant - speed one with modified boundary condition .",
    "this trick seems of general use . in particular",
    ", it might be possible that the energy methods of @xcite applied in this framework would yield unconditional stability of expansive boundary - layers , completing the analysis of the outflow case .",
    "alternatively , this case could be attacked by the methods of the present paper .",
    "these are two further interesting direction for future investigation .    in the outflow case ,",
    "a further transformation to the `` balanced flux form '' introduced in @xcite , in which the equations take the form of the integrated shock equations , allows us to establish stability in the characteristic limit by energy estimates like those of @xcite in the shock case .",
    "the treatment of the characteristic inflow limit by the methods of @xcite seems to be another extremely interesting direction for future study .    finally , we point to the extension of the present methods to full ( nonisentropic ) gas dynamics and multidimensions as the two outstanding open problems in this area .    new features of the present analysis as compared to the shock case considered in @xcite are the presence of two parameters , strength and displacement , indexing possible boundary layers , vs. the single parameter of strength in the shock case , and the fact that the limiting equations in several asymptotic regimes possess zero eigenvalues , making the limiting stability analysis much more delicate than in the shock case .",
    "the latter is seen , for example , in the limit as a compressive boundary layer approaches a full stationary shock solution , which we show to be spectrally equivalent to the situation of unintegrated shock equations on the whole line .",
    "as the equations on the line possess always a translational eigenvalue at @xmath32 , we may conclude existence of a zero at @xmath32 for the limiting equations and thus a zero _ near _ @xmath32 as we approach this limit , which could be stable or unstable .",
    "similarly , the evans function in the inflow case is shown to converge in the large - strength limit to a function with a zero at @xmath32 , with the same conclusions ; see section [ description ] for further details .    to deal with this latter circumstance",
    ", we find it necessary to make use also of topological information provided by the stability index of @xcite , a mod - two index counting the parity of the number of unstable eigenvalues . together with the information that there is at most one unstable zero ,",
    "the parity information provided by the stability index is sufficient to determine whether an unstable zero does or does not occur .",
    "remarkably , in the isentropic case we are able to compute explicitly the stability index for all parameter values , recovering results obtained by indirect argument in @xcite , and thereby completing the stability analysis in the presence of a single possibly unstable zero .",
    "we begin by carrying out a number of preliminary steps similar to those carried out in @xcite for the shock case , but complicated somewhat by the need to treat the boundary and its different conditions in the inflow and outflow case .",
    "the analyses of @xcite in the shock wave case were carried out in lagrangian coordinates , which proved to be particularly convenient .",
    "our first step , therefore , is to convert the eulerian formulation into lagrangian coordinates similar to those of the shock case .",
    "however , standard lagrangian coordinates in which the spatial variable @xmath33 is constant on particle paths are not appropriate for the boundary - value problem with inflow / outflow .",
    "we therefore introduce instead `` psuedo - lagrangian '' coordinates @xmath34 in which the physical boundary @xmath12 remains fixed at @xmath35 .",
    "straightforward calculation reveals that in these coordinates becomes    @xmath36    on @xmath37 , where @xmath38 so that @xmath39 is the negative of the momentum at the boundary @xmath40 . from now on ,",
    "we drop the tilde , denoting @xmath33 simply as @xmath7 .      for the inflow case ,",
    "@xmath22 so we may prescribe _ two _ boundary conditions on , namely @xmath41 where both @xmath42 are constant .      for the outflow case ,",
    "@xmath23 so we may prescribe _ only one _ boundary condition on , namely @xmath43 thus @xmath44 is an unknown in the problem , which makes the analysis of the outflow case more subtle than that of the inflow case .",
    "our next step is to rescale the equations in such a way that coefficients remain bounded in the strong boundary - layer limit . consider the change of variables @xmath45 where @xmath46 is chosen so that @xmath47 where @xmath25 is the limit as @xmath48 of the boundary layer ( stationary solution ) @xmath49 under consideration and @xmath50 is the limit as @xmath51 of its continuation into @xmath52 as a solution of the standing - wave ode ( discussed in more detail just below ) . under the rescaling , becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , on respective domains @xmath56      stationary boundary layers @xmath57 of satisfy @xmath58 where ( d ) is imposed at @xmath59 in the inflow case , @xmath60 in the outflow case and ( imposing @xmath61 ) @xmath62 . using ( a ) we can reduce this to the study of the scalar ode , @xmath63 with the same boundary conditions at @xmath12 and @xmath64 as above .",
    "taking the antiderivative of this equation yields @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a constant of integration .    noting that @xmath67 is convex",
    ", we find that there are precisely two rest points of whenever boundary - layer profiles exist , except at the single parameter value on the boundary between existence and nonexistence of solutions , for which there is a degenerate rest point ( double root of @xmath67 ) .",
    "ignoring this degenerate case , we see that boundary layers terminating at rest point @xmath25 as @xmath48 must either continue backward into @xmath52 to terminate at a second rest point @xmath50 as @xmath51 , or else blow up to infinity as @xmath51 . the first case we shall call _ compressive _ , the second _",
    "expansive_.    in the first case , the extended solution on the whole line may be recognized as a standing viscous shock wave ; that is , _ for isentropic gas dynamics , compressive boundary layers are just restrictions to the half - line @xmath68 [ resp .",
    "@xmath69 of standing shock waves .",
    "_ in the second case , as discussed in @xcite , the boundary layers are somewhat analogous to rarefaction waves on the whole line . from here on , we concentrate exclusively on the compressive case .    with the choice @xmath70 , we may carry out the integration of once more , this time as a definite integral from @xmath60 to @xmath7 , to obtain @xmath71 where @xmath72 is found by letting @xmath73 , yielding @xmath74 in particular , @xmath75 in the large boundary layer limit @xmath76 .",
