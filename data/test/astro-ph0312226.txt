    "diffuse radio emission from galaxy clusters is a rare phenomenon .",
    "these radio sources , which usually possess large sizes and steep spectra , are called radio halos if they permeate the cluster centers and radio relics if they are located in cluster peripheral regions .",
    "observations found that radio halos only exist in the clusters that show x - ray substructures @xcite .",
    "since a galaxy cluster possessing x - ray substructures indicates that it is under ongoing merging , it is expected that the formation of radio halos is closely related to the merging process of galaxy clusters .",
    "the diffuse radio emission of galaxy clusters is believed to be produced by the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons . nonetheless , the sources of these relativistic electrons are still unclear .",
    "cluster merging is a very violent event and releases a large amount of energy ( @xmath1 ergs ) ; this leads cluster mergers to be a very favorable mechanism for the production of the relativistic particles .",
    "however , relativistic electrons lose energy on the time scale of order @xmath2 years because of inverse compton and synchrotron losses ; this suggests that without re - acceleration radio halos in galaxy clusters might be transient features associated with a major merger and would have lifetimes @xmath0 0.1 gyr @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations of cluster mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed that the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is seriously disturbed by merging .",
    "violent turbulence generated by mergers must play an important role in the re - acceleration of relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "considering re - acceleration for the relativistic electrons , a two - phase model proposed by @xcite successfully reproduces the radial steepening of the spectral index , the radio spectrum steepening at high frequencies , and the hxr excess in the coma cluster ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on a similar study , @xcite showed that the  age \" of coma c might be @xmath0 1 gyr ; this indicates that the lifetimes of radio halos could be @xmath0 gyr if a significant level of re - acceleration is involved .",
    "the secondary electron model first proposed by @xcite assumes that relativistic electrons are produced from the pion decay following collisions between the cosmic - ray protons and the thermal ions of the icm .",
    "it has been recognized that the diffusion time of cosmic - ray protons is comparable with the cosmological time , so cosmic - ray protons are confined within galaxy clusters for the lifetimes of the clusters @xcite . if radio halos are formed from the secondary electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their lifetimes would be comparable with the cosmological time .",
    "the significantly different time scales of radio halos could have discernible effects on their number distribution and thus could discriminate on the origins of radio halos .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on the formalism of lc , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we follow the formalism of ks but modify it to suit the situation for forming radio halos .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the evolution and number distribution of radio halos with different lifetime scales .",
    "three typical lifetimes that are representatives of different origins for radio halos are considered ( i.e. 0.1 gyr , 1 gyr , and the cosmological time ) .",
    "we estimate the different number distributions and compare the results with observations to determine the valid models that are responsible for the origin of radio halos .",

    ", we describe the methods based on the formalism proposed by ks for calculating the formation rates and comoving number density of radio halos . in @xmath3  [ seccom ] , we compare the modelling results of radio halos with different lifetimes with observations , and in @xmath3  [ seccon ] we give our discussion and conclusions .",
    "radio halos are not found in low x - ray luminosity clusters and only present in massive clusters with high x - ray luminosity and high temperature @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that there might be a threshold mass for galaxy clusters to form radio halos .",
    "it has been recognized that radio halos are strongly correlated with cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , many cluster mergers do not possess radio halos .",
    "@xcite studied the dynamical states of clusters possessing radio halos and found that radio halos form preferentially in massive clusters experiencing violent mergers that have seriously disrupted the cluster core .",
    "disrupting the cluster core in the merging process should be an important factor for forming radio halos . according to above discussion",
    ", we assume two criteria for a cluster merger to form a radio halo : ( 1 ) the cluster mass must be greater than or equal to a threshold mass , and ( 2 ) the merging process must be violent enough to disrupt the cluster core . under these two conditions , mergers might generate sufficient primary electrons or secondary electrons from cosmic - ray protons to form radio halos .",
    "we use observational data @xcite to determine the threshold mass .",
    "we found that the a548b cluster has the lowest temperature @xmath0 2.4 kev @xcite , which is presumed to have the smallest mass from the well - known mass - temperature relation for galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "using the observed mass - temperature relationship @xcite @xmath4 we found that the a548b cluster has a mass of @xmath5 for @xmath6 or @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "since very few clusters with lower temperatures have been found to possess radio halos , the threshold mass may be on the order of @xmath9 .",

    "since these x - ray luminous clusters are generally very massive and have undergone through multiple mergers during their formation , it is expected that these massive clusters would have accumulated a large amount of cosmic - ray protons from their formation history ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cosmic - ray protons would be confined in the clusters longer than the cosmological time , and the lifetimes of radio halos would be comparable with the cosmological time in the secondary electron model . if the secondary electron model was applicable , most of these massive clusters should possess radio halos ; our results show that the percentage of clusters possessing radio halos should be greater than @xmath106 .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observations in which only @xmath0 35% of these massive clusters possess radio halos . according to these results",
    ", the secondary electrons do not seem to be the dominant origin of the radio halos .",
    "on the other hand , if radio halos were transient phenomena associated with a single acceleration event , such as a major merger shock , they would have lifetimes @xmath93 gyr .",
    "because of the short lifetimes of the sources , radio halos would be hardly observable even in the massive clusters .",
    "the observed percentage @xmath0 35% is thus too high to explain in the hierarchical clustering formation model .",
    "according to the results presented in @xmath3  [ seccom ] , the lifetimes of radio halos may be @xmath0 gyr . as mentioned in @xmath3",
    "[ secint ] , relativistic electrons in icm lose energy on the time scale of order @xmath2 years because of the inverse compton and synchrotron losses .",
    "this indicates that a significant level of re - acceleration is necessary to support the relativistic electrons against radiative losses and to maintain radio halos to last for @xmath0 gyr @xcite .    as discussed in",
    "  [ seccom ] , the percentage of radio halos for @xmath84 erg s@xmath37 , @xmath0 28%38% , is more robust .",
    "we here investigate the effects of the lifetime of the radio halos , the dividing mass , and the threshold mass ratio @xmath107 on our results . only the @xmath34cdm model is considered .",
    "first , the lifetimes of radio halos can affect the ratios of the radio halos .",
    "the percentage of radio halos with @xmath94 gyr is @xmath108 and seems to be lower than the observational results , @xmath0 28%38% , as shown in table  [ tbl ] .",
    "however , we note that the lifetime of the radio halo is of @xmath0 gyr and could be slightly longer or shorter than 1 gyr and the difference of the assumed lifetime could affect the predicted percentage of the radio halo .",
    "for example , if a longer lifetime for the radio halo , @xmath109 gyr , is assumed , then the percentage of the radio halo would become @xmath110 and would be in agreement with the observational results .",
    "second , the dividing mass at @xmath111 may be lower than the realistic mass corresponding to @xmath112 erg s@xmath37 . for example , the a773 cluster with @xmath113 erg s@xmath37 has mass in the range 1.252.08 @xmath114 @xcite . in table",
    "[ tb3 ] , we show the percentages corresponding to different dividing masses .",
    "obviously , the results with @xmath94 gyr are improved but those with @xmath77 cosmological time are worse if a higher and more realistic dividing mass is taken .",
    "third , different threshold @xmath115 also affect our results .",
    "the results with different @xmath115 are shown in table  [ tb4 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath115 strongly affect the results for @xmath94 gyr and @xmath77 cosmological time .",
    "for @xmath116 , the results with @xmath77 cosmological time seems to be close to the observational results ; this implies that the radio halos would only be generated in the mergers with two nearly equal - mass progenitors if the secondary electrons were the dominant origin for forming radio halos . for @xmath117 ,",
    "the ratio of the radio halos with @xmath94 gyr is consistent with the observational results . obviously , the @xmath115 is a dominant factor in the determining the ratio of the radio halos .",
    "thus it is important to investigate in detail the exact value of @xmath115 to clarify the question .",
    "note that we have assumed that a merger with mass greater than a threshold mass will form a radio halo if its relative mass increase exceeds a threshold , @xmath115 .",
    "it might be possible that some mergers that satisfy our criteria did not form radio halos .",
    "however , according to the study of @xcite for @xmath0 30 bright x - ray clusters , the number of the unaccounted mergers should be very small and thus has little effect on our results .",
    "magnetic fields could be also an important parameter in determining the radio powers of the cluster radio halos .",
    "it is very difficult and complicated to determine this parameter .",
    "magnetic fields @xmath118 0.4 @xmath119 g were found for several clusters using the inverse compton models for the hard x - ray excess @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the cluster fields are typically around 510 @xmath119 g using rotation measurements .",
    "furthermore , during a cluster merging process , the magnetic fields might be amplified by a factor of @xmath0 20 on small scales @xcite and might have a non - negligible effect on the radio emission .",
    "however , we note that both the magnetic field energy and the relativistic particle energy are provided by the merging energy , which is a function of the merger mass . in other words ,",
    "the cluster mass should be a more fundamental parameter in determining the radio powers of the radio halos @xcite .",
    "since we have considered the merger mass as a main parameter in our calculation , we thus do not treat the magnetic field as an independent parameter .",
    "we could try to match the results obtained from the secondary electron model ( @xmath0 70% ) with the observations ( @xmath0 35% ) by assuming that about half of the radio halos produced by the secondary electrons are unobservable .",
    "however , @xcite showed that for a cluster of given mass the radio power from the secondary electrons could vary by almost an order of magnitude in their simulation .",
    "we note that such level of variation , as also detected in observation @xcite , is not large enough to make a detectable radio halo source to become non - detectable , especially for high x - ray luminosity clusters at low redshifts .",
    "it is thus unlikely to apply some observational effects to lower the radio halo fraction of the secondary electron model to match the observational results .",
    "the radio halo fraction of galaxy clusters have been estimated in some recent studies .",
    "@xcite estimated the fraction of cluster radio halos based on the radiative energy loss timescale of the relativistic electrons .",
    "this timescale is similar to our case for primary electrons without re - acceleration and can account for only @xmath120 of observations . to match the observations , they assumed that even a rather weak merger should also trigger a radio halo .",
    "this assumption seems to be in contradiction with observations , which showed that only massive clusters experiencing violent mergers can have halos @xcite as we have discussed in @xmath3  [ secfc ] .",
    "@xcite estimated the cluster radio halo luminosity function by assuming a radio halo fraction @xmath121 for all clusters .",
    "however , observations showed that the halo fraction is very different for low and high luminosity x - ray clusters and it is inconsistent with current observations to assume a constant radio halo fraction for all clusters . @xcite",
    "have noted that the lack of diffuse radio sources in low x - ray luminosity clusters is real because of their low redshifts ; @xcite have also stressed that the correlation between the halo radio power and the cluster x - ray luminosity is only applied to clusters showing major mergers and therefore can not be generalized to all clusters .",
    "the other more realistic fraction adopted by @xcite is estimated by assuming that a cluster can possess a radio halo if its mass increases by more than 40% of its present mass within half a dynamical timescale . in their work ,",
    "the fraction for clusters with mass of @xmath122 is 0.32 .",
    "this seems to agree with the observational results for @xmath84 erg s@xmath37 .",
    "however , the fraction for clusters with mass of @xmath123 and that for clusters with mass of @xmath124 are 0.26 and 0.22 , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that the radio halo ratio for @xmath82 erg s@xmath37 should be greater than 20% and therefore are in conflict with the observations .",
    "we also note that the effects of the secondary electron model on the radio halo fraction were not considered in previous studies .",
    "our results are based on the assumption that the diffuse radio emission is associated with cluster merger events .",
    "we note that radio galaxies , starbursts , and agns might also contribute significant relativistic electrons to the icm of the clusters .",
    "however , the high - energy ( @xmath125 gev ) relativistic electrons injected by these sources would become invisible in a very short time and can not directly account for the extended radio emission . on the other hand , the low - energy ( @xmath126 gev ) relativistic electrons can survive a longer time and become more extended via diffusion .",
    "a cluster merger event , as suggested in this paper for the diffuse radio emission phenomena , can produce merger shocks and mhd turbulence that can re - accelerate the survived low - energy relativistic electrons and reignite the radio emission in a more extended region . in this respect ,",
    "our results are also applicable even the relativistic electrons are originally injected from radio galaxies , starburst galaxies , or agns .",
    "we note that the effects of the inverse compton loss rising with increasing redshift may reduce the ratio of radio halos at high redshifts , but the results at low redshifts are only slightly affected and the conclusions are still tenable .",

    "<S> the lifetimes of radio halos would be comparable with the cosmological time if the radio - emitting electrons are mainly the secondary electrons generated by pion decay following proton - proton collisions between cosmic - ray protons and the thermal intra - cluster medium within the galaxy clusters . adopting both observational and theoretical constraints for the formation of radio halos , we calculate the formation rates and the comoving number density of radio halos in the hierarchical clustering scheme . comparing with observations , we find that the lifetimes of radio halos are @xmath0 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that a significant level of re - acceleration is necessary for the observed radio halos and the secondary electrons may not be a dominant origin for radio halos . </S>"
