    "giving a talk on three dimensional ( 3d ) gravity at a meeting in cracow is like carrying coal to newcastle : the beginnings of the subject are usually traced back to the paper @xcite by andrzej staruszkiewicz , alumnus and later professor at the jagellonian university in cracow .",
    "staruszkiewicz s paper , published in 1963 , is about classical 3d gravity and its special features .",
    "the subject of 3d _ quantum _ gravity started only five years later with the realisation by ponzano and regge @xcite that angular momentum theory plays an important role in this context .",
    "gravity in 3d is now a large subject in its own right , which i can not possibly review here .",
    "however , in this introductory part of the talk i will at least attempt to identify a few of the main themes and relate them to the approach followed here .",
    "influential papers by deser , t hooft and jackiw written in the 1980s @xcite on classical and quantum scattering of particles demonstrated the possibility of carrying out non - perturbative calculations of quantum scattering processes in 3d gravity . as we shall see",
    ", they also contain indications of the relevance of the braid group in describing such processes .",
    "these indications are elaborated in the later literature , see for example @xcite , and turn out to be closely related to the quantum group approach pursued in this talk .",
    "the chern - simons formulation of 3d gravity , observed in @xcite and elaborated in @xcite , establishes a connection between 3d gravity and a host of areas in mathematical physics , including topological field theory , knot theory , the theory of poisson - lie groups and of quantum groups .",
    "since this talk is based on the chern - simons approach , we will see many of these connections .",
    "the early paper by ponzano and regge , mentioned above , provides the foundation of the spin foam approach to 3d quantum gravity .",
    "this is perhaps the approach to 3d quantum gravity that contains the most directly useful lessons for 4d quantum gravity .",
    "i will not discuss this approach in this talk , and shall not attempt to summarise the large literature on it .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that there are close links with chern - simons theory ( spin foam state sums may be viewed as discretisation of the path integral ) and to quantum groups , see @xcite for an early paper and @xcite for examples of recent papers with many references .    the possibility that non - commutative geometry is needed to describe spacetime at the quantum level",
    "has long been a theme in quantum gravity research @xcite , see @xcite for a recent discussion with some references .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask if one can use the relatively tractable 3d situation to establish the role of non - commutative geometry in quantum gravity in a mathematically convincing way .",
    "early discussions of non - commutative spacetime coordinates appear in the paper @xcite .",
    "spacetime non - commutativity in 3d quantum gravity is studied , in different approaches , in @xcite .",
    "putting these approaches into one coherent picture is one of the objectives of this talk .",
    "finally , i should mention two further important themes of 3d gravity research which i will not be able to touch on in this talk .",
    "one is the study of btz black holes , an introduction to which can be found in the book @xcite .",
    "the other is the relation to 3d hyperbolic geometry , where the papers and books @xcite may provide good starting points .",
    "the einstein field equations ( without cosmological constant and in units where the speed of light is 1 ) @xmath3    determine the ricci tensor of a spacetime in terms of the energy momentum tensor . in spacetime dimensions greater than three , the ricci tensor does not fix the riemann tensor and it is possible to have metrically non - trivial ( i.e. curved ) spacetimes satisfying the vacuum ( @xmath4 ) field equations . in three spacetime dimensions ,",
    "this is not possible .",
    "the ricci tensor determines the riemann tensor and , as a result , the only vacuum solutions of the einstein equations with vanishing cosmological constant are flat @xcite .",
    "this result simplifies einstein s theory of gravity in 3d dramatically , but does not render it trivial .",
    "there are non - trivial solutions of the einstein equations in the presence of matter , and , if the topology of the three - dimensional manifold representing the universe is non - trivial , there may be vacuum solutions which , though flat , have non - trivial holonomy .",
    "these observations are often summarised in the slogan that in 3d gravity there are no gravitational waves but that the theory has topological degrees of freedom .    the simplest solution of the einstein equations illustrating the previous paragraph is the spacetime surrounding a point - particle .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is a dirac delta - function with support on the world line of the particle.the metric solving the field equations is flat away from the world line and is singular on the world line .",
    "more precisely it is a direct product of a cone ( space ) and @xmath5 ( representing time ) @xcite .",
    "the line element , in terms of polar coordinates @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and a time coordinate @xmath8 is simply [ pointsolution ] ds^2 = c^2dt^2 -dr^2 - r^2 d^2 .",
    "however , the range of @xmath9 is @xmath10 , where the parameter @xmath11 is related to the particle s mass @xmath12 and to newton s constant @xmath13 via @xmath14 in three dimensions , the physical dimension of @xmath13 is that of an inverse mass so that @xmath11 is a dimensionless , angular parameter .",
    "the effect of a particle on the geometry of spacetimes is , then , to cut out a wedge of size @xmath11 from the spacetime surrounding the particle s world line .",
    "it is instructive to consider the effect of the geometry on light test particles .",
    "such particles travel on geodesics , which are simply straight lines on the cone after it has been cut open .",
    "it is easy to check that geodesics passing the particle of mass @xmath12 on one side are deflecting relative to particles who pass it on the other side by the angle @xmath11 ( in the coordinate system @xmath15 ) .",
    "this relative deflection is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ conedeflection ] and is independent of the distance of closest approach between the heavy particle of mass @xmath12 and the test particles ( impact parameter ) .",
    "the interaction is topological in the sense that it only depends on whether the test particle passes on the left or the right of the heavy particle , and not on the relative distance .",
    "this kind of interaction is familiar from the aharonov - bohm interaction between electrons and a magnetic flux , and this analogy can be made precise : both interactions can be related to the braiding of the world lines of the interacting particles @xcite .    ]",
    "the four physical constant entering 3d quantum gravity are the speed of light @xmath1 , newton s constant @xmath13 , planck s constant @xmath16 and the cosmological constant @xmath2 . from these",
    ", we can form two length constants ( remembering that the dimension of @xmath13 is an inverse mass ) , namely [ constants ] _ p= , _ c = . in this talk",
    "we will deal with both lorentzian and euclidean gravity , and we parametrise euclidean and lorentzian metrics in a unified fashion by allowing @xmath17 in the euclidean situation . as a result",
    ", both the length parameters in may be imaginary , depending on the sign of @xmath18 and @xmath2 . from the ratio of the two length parameters we can form a dimensionless quantity .",
    "we define the deformation parameter [ qpara ] q= e^- , which may take values on the real line or the unit circle in the complex plane .",
    "it is useful to clarify the role played by the various constants in 3d gravity in general terms at this stage . the observation of the previous section that , in the absence of matter , solutions of the einstein equations are locally flat generalises in the presence of a cosmological constant to the statement that vacuum solutions are locally isometric to model space times , which depend on the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for lorentzian gravity with vanishing cosmological constant , for example , the model spacetime is minkowski space while for euclidean gravity with positive cosmological constant it is the four - sphere with the round metric .",
    "the isometry groups of the model spacetimes inherit a dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in the examples above they are , respectively , the poincar group in 3d and the 4d rotation group @xmath19 .",
    "constant @xmath13 enters when one studies the dynamics of spacetime and plays the role of a parameter in the poisson structure and that of a coupling constant to matter .",
    "finally , @xmath16 enters in the quantisation and the dimensionless parameter @xmath20 in , combining all four constant , controls the quantum theory when all the constants @xmath21 are non - zero .",
    "the goal of this talk is give a unified account of aspects of classical and quantum gravity in 3d , in which the physical parameters of the previous section enter as deformation parameters .",
    "our account of classical gravity is based on the formulation of 3d gravity as a chern - simons gauge theory , where the local isometry groups play the role of the gauge groups .",
    "as well shall see , the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 enter in this description via the structure constants of the lie algebra of the gauge group , while the parameter @xmath13 enters via the inner product ( or trace ) on the lie algebra which is used in the chern - simons action .",
    "we sketch the description of the phase space of 3d gravity as the moduli space of flat connections , and review the description of its poisson structure in a formulation , due to fock and rosly @xcite , which makes essential use of classical @xmath22-matrices .",
    "the description of the poisson structure in terms of @xmath22-matrices is tailor - made for the quantisation via the combinatorial or hamiltonian scheme pioneered in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in this scheme , the quantisation is controlled by quantum groups which are deformations of the local isometry groups of the model spacetimes , with deformation parameters @xmath13 and @xmath16 in addition to @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these quantum groups naturally act on non - commutative spaces , which one may interpret as deformations of the classical model spacetimes .",
    "this framework thus provides a concrete mathematical setting for exploring the proposal that , in quantum gravity , spacetime should be mathematically modelled in terms of non - commutative geometry .",
    "we end our talk with an evaluation of the successes and limitations of this approach to 3d quantum gravity .",
    "the following treatment of the model spacetimes follows closely that in @xcite .",
    "we use roman letters @xmath23 for 3d spacetimes indices , with range for @xmath24 ( in both the euclidean and lorentzian case ) .",
    "the model spacetimes arising in 3d gravity can be described in a simple an unified fashion in terms of the metric [ 4dmetric ] g_=(-c^2,1,1,1 ) in an auxiliary @xmath25 . here",
    "we use greek indices for the range @xmath26 .",
    "the model spacetimes can be realised as embedded hypersurfaces via [ hypersur ] h_c,= \\{(t , x , y , w)^4| -c^2t^2 + x^2 + y^2 + w^2 = } .",
    "this two - parameter family includes the three - sphere @xmath27 ( @xmath17 , @xmath28 ) , doubles covers of hyperbolic space @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , de sitter space ds@xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath28 ) and anti - de sitter space ads@xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "double covers of euclidean space @xmath34 and minkowski @xmath35 space arise in the limit @xmath36 , which one should take _ after _ multiplying the defining equation in by @xmath2 . in fig",
    ".  [ modelspaces ] we show the embedded model spacetimes ( with one spatial dimension suppressed ) .     according to ( the second spatial coordinate @xmath37 is suppressed ) .",
    "euclidean and minkowski space at the top , spherical and de sitter space in the middle , hyperbolic and anti - de sitter space at the bottom , title=\"fig : \" ] +   according to ( the second spatial coordinate @xmath37 is suppressed ) .",
    "euclidean and minkowski space at the top , spherical and de sitter space in the middle , hyperbolic and anti - de sitter space at the bottom , title=\"fig : \" ]   according to ( the second spatial coordinate @xmath37 is suppressed ) .",

    "euclidean and minkowski space at the top , spherical and de sitter space in the middle , hyperbolic and anti - de sitter space at the bottom , title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to be able to take the limit @xmath38 for the associated isometry groups it is best to work with the inverse metric [ invmet ] g^=(-,1,1 , ) .",
    "the lie algebra generators of the isometry groups of can conveniently be defined in terms of the clifford algebra associated to @xcite .",
    "thus we define generators @xmath39 via \\{^,^}=-2g^ , so that the six lie algebra generators are given by m^=1 4 [ ^,^ ] .",
    "they have the commutation relations [ masterlie ] [ m^ , m^ ] = g^ m^ + g^ m^- g^ m^-g^ m^. the advantage of the clifford algebra approach is that one can immediately write down two naturally defined invariant bilinear forms .",
    "one , denoted @xmath40 is defined by carrying out the clifford multiplication and projecting onto the invariant , central element @xmath41 .",
    "multplying by @xmath42 for later convenience , the resulting inner product is non - zero whenever the indices on the basis vectors are complementary , for example @xmath43 another bilinear form @xmath44 is obtained by carrying out the clifford multiplication and projecting onto the identity .",
    "again rescaling by @xmath42 for convenience we have a non - zero answer whenever the indices on the basis vectors match : @xmath45",
    "as we shall see shortly , this is the killing form on the lie algebra    we now express the above generators in more conventional 3d notation . for this purpose",
    "we define the three - dimensional totally antisymmetric tensor with downstairs indices via @xmath46 .",
    "then we define the rotation generator @xmath47 , the boost generators @xmath48 and translation generators @xmath49 via [ liegens ] _",
    "abcm^bc,_a = g_abm^b3 , where we used the spacetime part of the 4d metric @xmath50 to lower indices , and refer to @xcite for a discussion of physical dimensions and interpretation of these generators ( which are denoted by the same letters , but without tilde there ) .",
    "the lie algebra brackets are now [ t21alg ] [ _",
    "a,_b]=_abcj^c , = _",
    "abc ^ c ,=- c^2 _ abc^c , with indices raised via the inverse metric @xmath51 .",
    "the combination @xmath52 which occurs in the lie brackets plays an important role in what follows , and we introduce [ algebraicconstant ] = -c^2 .",
    "the bilinear form @xmath44 , already advertised as the killing form , is [ nongravin ] ( _ a,_b)=_ab,(_a,_b)=_ab , where _",
    "g_ab = ( 1 , - , - ) .",
    "the metric @xmath53 is the most natural one on the lie algebra @xmath54 respectively @xmath55 spanned by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that it differs from the spacetime metric @xmath58 , but that it has the right physical dimensions and that imaginary @xmath1 gives the usual euclidean metric , as required .",
    "it is one of the coincidences of 3d that spacetime and the lie algebra of rotations and/or boosts are both three - dimensional .",
    "both are equipped with euclidean respectively lorentzian metrics , but our derivation shows that , in a physically natural normalisation and construction , the spacetime and lie algebra metrics come out differently .",
    "this is potentially confusing in calculations where indices are raised and contracted with these metrics , and most papers on 3d gravity use conventions where the two kinds of metrics coincide .",
    "we can achieve this by switching from the physical lie algebra basis used thus far to a geometrical basis according to @xmath59 in this geometrical basis , all the generators @xmath60 are dimensionless , and all the translation generators @xmath61 have the dimension of inverse time .",
    "one checks that the killing metric now takes the form [ 3dmetric ] ( j_a , j_b)= _ ab:=(1,- , - ) , which is diag@xmath62 in the euclidean and diag@xmath63 in the lorentzian case .",
    "moreover , the lie brackets take the _ same _ form as in , [ 21alg ] [ j_a , j_b]=_abcj^c , = _",
    "abc p^ c,= _ abcj^c , but all indices are now raised with the lie algebra metric @xmath64 .",
    "this is convenient and we shall work in this basis for the remainder of this talk .",
    "we denote the lie algebra with these brackets by @xmath65 .",
    "the conventions regarding the metric then agree with @xcite , but the convention regarding the naming of @xmath66 agrees with @xcite and differs from @xcite , where @xmath2 was used for what we call @xmath66 now .",
    "conventions regarding the naming of the cosmological constant and the combination differ in the literature , and the reader will need to take good care when comparing results from different sources .",
    "the other bilinear form introduced in the clifford language gives the following non - zero pairings [ 3dgravin ] j_a , p_b = c^2_ab .",
    "this pairing is non - degenerate for any value of @xmath66 and is crucial for the chern - simons formulation of 3d gravity , as we shall see .    in table",
    "[ isogroups ] we list lie groups whose lie algebras are .",
    "we have used the isomorphisms @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the identity component of @xmath69 .",
    "the isometry groups are determined by their lie algebras only up to coverings , and our choice in table  [ isogroups ] is one of convenience . in the following , we write @xmath70 for this family of lie groups .",
    ".local isometry groups in 3d gravity [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have seen that the combinatorial quantisation of the chern - simons formulation of 3d gravity gives a unified picture of the various regimes of 3d gravity , with the physical parameters @xmath71 and @xmath16 entering as deformation parameters in distinctive ways .",
    "quantum groups naturally replace the classical isometry groups in this approach to 3d quantum gravity , and non - commutative spacetimes replace the classical model spacetimes . in general , the relation between the quantum isometry groups and the physical hilbert space of 3d quantum gravity is a formal one , but we have seen that aspects of the quantum isometry groups like the non - commutative momentum addition and the braiding via the quantum @xmath72-matrix have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "it is worth noting that it is possible to take a galilean limit @xmath73 in the framework discussed here @xcite , and that the non - commutative quantum space is the moyal plane in that case , with a time - dependent non - commutativity of the spatial coordinates .    in order to clarify the physical interpretation of quantum isometry groups and the associated non - commutative spacetimes it may be useful to consider universes with a boundary instead of the spatially compact universes considered in this talk .",
    "the treatment of boundaries in the classical theory is discussed in @xcite but a general treatment of the quantisation has not been given .",
    "another approach would be to work directly on the physical phase space as in @xcite , and to attempt the quantisation there .",
    "other quantum groups than quantum doubles have been discussed in relation to 3d quantum gravity , notably bicrossproducts or @xmath74-poincar algebras which were originally introduce in 4d @xcite . as shown in @xcite , the @xmath74-poincar algebra with the usual time - like deformation parameter",
    "is _ not _ compatible with 3d gravity in the combinatorial framework . on the other hand ,",
