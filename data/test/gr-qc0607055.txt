    "the question of the causal behavior of superluminal propagations has been often debated , in rather different contexts : tachyonic particles ( e.g. @xcite ) , field theories @xcite and quantum induced superluminal propagations @xcite .",
    "the issue is however controversial , even on specific contexts , and we intend to clarify it",
    ".    we will focus on classical field theories _ whose full action is lorentz invariant _ ( or diffeomorphism invariant whenever einstein s gravity is taken into account ) . in that case ,",
    "superluminal behavior can only arises from spontaneous breaking of local lorentz invariance by non trivial backgrounds ( or vacua ) .",
    "superluminal behavior then occurs when some sector of the theory is left unbroken , so that some degrees of freedom can propagate faster than other ones @xcite .",
    "superluminal propagations induced by vacuum polarization provide well - known examples of this phenomenon .",
    "note that we define superluminal behavior as going faster than gravitons [ i.e. , gravitational waves ] .",
    "we denote @xmath0 the speed of gravitons in vacuum .",
    "this maybe unconventional definition will not affect our arguments . in the standard theory of gravity photons propagate along the gravitational metric so that this definition is the usual one in that case .",
    "our general analysis will enable us to investigate the causal behavior of any field coupled to standard gravity .",
    "we will illustrate our arguments in three important cases : k - essence scalar fields , bimetric theories of gravity and quantum induced superluminal propagations .",
    "we will make constant use of many important ideas and tools that were developed in order to investigate the causal behavior of gr , and we refer notably to @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ causalite ] , we analyze in detail the meaning of causality in classical field theories . we stress the important role played by the notions of chronology , time arrow and cauchy problem in its definition . as an illustration",
    ", we show how causality is usually formulated in the theory of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "we stress that superluminal propagations are automatically discarded if one assumes that causality should be defined with respect to the chronology induced by the gravitational metric .",
    "this _ postulate _ actually `` sets the [ gravitational ] metric apart from the other fields on @xmath1 and gives it its distinctive geometrical character '' @xcite .",
    "this prior assumption can not be supported by any mathematical reason but only by experiment .",
    "if superluminal propagations were found in the laboratory , it would thus _ not _ mean that causality , locality , or the entire framework of special relativity would be lost , but simply that the gravitational field does not have any fundamental geochronological character .",
    "in particular , causality should not be expressed in terms of the chronology induced by the gravitational metric field . as a consequence ,",
    "it is necessary to drop such prior assumptions to address the issue of the causal behavior of superluminal fields . in sec .",
    "[ causalityandsuperluminalbehav ] we thus look for a minimal expression of causality in which no prior chronology is assumed . in that framework , superluminal propagations are generically allowed .    before moving to superluminal and causal theories , we display two well known examples of noncausal theories and notably the tachyonic one .",
    "it enables us to stress how noncausal behaviors are related to constraints on initial data .",
    "we also comment on the causal paradoxes that arise in a non causal theory .",
    "we finally briefly investigate what kind of field theory can lead to superluminal propagation .",

    "we find that the scalar field is causal provided that the spacetime embedded with the effective metric @xmath4 is globally hyperbolic . here",
    "@xmath4 is the effective metric evaluated on a solution @xmath5 to the field equation ( the background ) .",
    "this condition puts some generic constraints on the free function defining the theory , and is generally satisfied on reasonable backgrounds .",
    "we emphasize that the claim that such scalar fields are not causal even on globally hyperbolic backgrounds @xcite can only hold if a prior role is attributed to the gravitational ( or flat ) metric , an assumption that , we believe , was implicit in these works .",
    "the only threat for causality actually lies in global properties of backgrounds @xcite , and this can be related to the so - called chronology protection conjecture .    in sec .",
    "[ bimetrictheories ] , we investigate the question of causality in a bimetric theory of gravity , in which the matter sector is universally coupled to a metric @xmath6 that can differ from the einstein - hilbert metric @xmath7 .",
    "these two metrics generally define two distinct `` causal '' cones .",
    "photons can travel faster than gravitons , and conversely .",
    "if causality is defined with respect to the chronology induced by the gravitational metric , then causality forces the matter metric @xmath6 to define a cone which coincide or lie within the gravitational cone , and conversely .",
    "these two choices of chronology have been considered in the literature , thus leading to opposite requirements on the theory .",
    "this will illustrate the fact that there is no clear reason why a metric , or a chronology , should be preferred to the other .",
    "we argue that the theory is actually causal if no prior chronology is assumed , but the solution to the cauchy problem depends , of course , on the precise dynamics of the matter sector .    in sec .",
    "[ sectionqed ] , we briefly show how our analysis apply to the case of quantum induced superluminal propagations .",
    "this enables us to conclude that superluminal velocities do not threaten causality , a point that were still controversial .",
    "let us emphasize that the question of causality in k - essences or bimetric theories is not just of academical interest , since these theories have drawn much attention recently .",
    "quite generally , it is claimed that causality forces one of the cone to be wider than the others ones ( be it the gravitational or the matter one ) @xcite and this puts some constraints on the theory .",
    "our motivated definition of causality will however not support these claims .",
    "such a k - essence scalar field was notably used as a ( dynamical ) dark energy fluid responsible of the late time acceleration of the universe @xcite , as well as a fluid that drives inflation @xcite .",
    "it is also used as a new gravitational field in addition to the metric one in some relativistic theories of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) , that are intended to account for the mass discrepancy at astrophysical scales without invoking dark matter @xcite .",
    "some of these models were notably discarded because of the presence of superluminal propagations .",
    "bimetric theories are also an essential piece of some recent mond - like theories @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it represents the best motivated framework that reproduces a varying speed of light scenario @xcite that may address the problems of standard cosmology in a rather different way than inflation does . indeed some vsl theories , in which the speed of light @xmath0 is replaced by a changing velocity @xmath8 _ inside _ the equation of motions @xcite , however interesting phenomenologically , are not satisfying theoretically @xcite ( the resulting theory can not be derived from an action ) .    in the last section [ applications ] ,",
    "we consider some applications of our work to these field theories . we investigate the links between causality and stability in k - essences theories .",
    "we show that ( k - essence ) ghosts stabilization might suffer from a serious problem .",
    "we also show that , if one reproduces the mond phenomenology with the help of a k - essence scalar field , then a slight modification of milgrom s law is necessary for the theory to be causally well - behaved .",
    "it leads to a non trivial modification of the phenomenology in the very low acceleration regime .",
    "we also comment on a simpler theory that reproduces the mond phenomenology , using only one scalar field .",
    "the initial value formulation of this theory has still to be checked and we leave it for further work .",
    "we briefly show how this framework can account for the pioneer anomaly , and we finally make some comments about vsl theories .",
    "we use , throughout the paper , the sign conventions of @xcite and notably the mostly @xmath9 signature .",
    "the flat metric is denoted @xmath10 or @xmath11 in a coordinate system .",
    "we denote @xmath7 the gravitational metric field ( which obeys the einstein equation ) and @xmath6 the matter metric to which matter field couples . unless specified , indices are moved with the help of the gravitational metric @xmath7 .",
    "in the present paper , we are interested in the superluminal behavior of some matter fields in a gr - like context .",
    "the metric field @xmath7 follows the dynamics induced by the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "by spacetime we will always mean a couple ( @xmath12 ) , where @xmath1 is a four - dimensional differentiable manifold and @xmath13 some non degenerate lorentzian metric on it . a superluminal signal , _ by definition _",
    ", propagates along spacelike curves of the gravitational metric @xmath7 .",
    "by causality we usually mean the ability to find a cause to an effect . since cause and effects are both described in terms of some physical variables , the usual principle of causality states that physical variables should be unambiguously determined at a given time from their values at a time before .",
    "we also demand that this retrodiction can be converted forward in time , so that we should also be able to predict a future situation from a present one .",
    "the principle of causality thus requires that determinism holds `` in both directions of time '' .",
    "causality demands the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equations of motion given some initial data . in mathematical words , equations of motion must have a well - posed cauchy problem , or initial value formulation .",
    "note that this definition shows that a time - ordering , or chronology , must exist between two spacetime points that are causally connected .",
    "unlike newton s theory where a global chronology preexists to dynamics because of the prior topology assigned to spacetime , namely @xmath14 , field theories ( including einstein s gravity ) do _ not _ involve a preexistent notion of time and chronology . on the contrary",
    ", any relativistic field @xmath15 defines its own chronology on @xmath1 by means of the metric @xmath16 along which it propagates .",
    "any lorentzian metric indeed induces a local chronology in the tangent space through the usual special relativistic notions of absolute ( i.e. , lorentz invariant ) future and past .",
    "let us consider one particular field @xmath17 that propagates along a metric @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to note that this metric may not induce a global chronology on the whole spacetime .",
    "this is the case if local causal cones of @xmath13 are distributed on the manifold in such a way that there exists a curve over @xmath1 which is everywhere future - directed timelike but closed . in that case , the field @xmath17 propagates along a closed curve and an event could be _ both _ the cause and the effect of another event .",
    "causality requires that it does not happen .",
    "the strongest way to prevent it is to require the global hyperbolicity exists @xcite .",
    "it can then be proved that the spacetime has the topology of @xmath18 , so that a global time function , i.e. , a global chronology exists .",
    "] of the spacetime ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "let us emphasize that causality also requires a notion of time flow .",
    "it is indeed worth recalling that even if the above metric @xmath13 defines a global notion of future and past , we have also to require that the field @xmath17 can only propagate in the future",
    ". if it could , on the contrary , propagate both in future and in past , one could always form a closed timelike curve with it . on the other hand ,",
    "global hyperbolicity is enough to guarantee that no closed _ future - directed _ timelike curves ( cftc ) exists .    when there is a finite number of metrics @xmath16 on @xmath1 , the discussion of global properties is slightly more involved , see sec .",
    "[ causalityandsuperluminalbehav ] .",
    "let us illustrate the previous discussion . in gr ,",
    "causality is generally expressed by the following properties",
    "@xcite :    1 .   the gravitational metric @xmath7 must define a global chronology on spacetime .",
    "2 .   `` the null cones of the matter equations coincide or lie within the null cone of the spacetime metric @xmath7 '' .",
    "@xcite 3 .",
    "the whole set of equations of motion must admit a well - posed cauchy problem .",
    "the point ( a ) guarantees the existence of a global time ordering on @xmath1 and the point ( c ) is the formal expression of determinism . note that it is a non trivial mathematical property of systems of differential equations .",
    "its satisfaction in gr therefore critically depends on the precise dynamics of the matter sector .",
    "the point ( b ) excludes faster - than - graviton propagation .",
    "equivalently then , it means that any initial data set on spacelike hypersurfaces with respect to the gravitational metric @xmath7 are allowed .",
    "since the metric @xmath7 defines a global chronology on spacetime , so does any other metric @xmath16 associated to the propagation of some matter fields ) is globally hyperbolic and if @xmath19 is a metric whose null cone coincide or lie within the null cone of the metric @xmath13 _ everywhere on _",
    "@xmath1 , then ( @xmath20 ) is globally hyperbolic . ] .",
    "the conditions ( a ) and ( b ) therefore ensures that no cftc exist for any metric ( be it @xmath7 or any metric @xmath16 ) .",
    "let us emphasize that , in the above formulation ( a)(c ) , the gravitational metric field clearly plays a preferred role .",
    "both conditions ( a ) and ( b ) are such that causality is actually defined with respect to the chronology induced by the metric @xmath7 .",
    "this can be understood as a `` _ _ postulate _ _ which sets the metric * g * apart from the other fields on @xmath1 and gives it its distinctive geometrical character '' ( @xcite @xmath21 , emphasis added ) .",
    "the chronology defined by @xmath7 is thus assumed to be a preferred one on @xmath1 .",
    "this postulate is however arguable because , as we pointed out , any relativistic field induces its own chronology on spacetime .",
    "it notably means that if a signal made of waves of some field @xmath15 propagates between two spacetime points , then these points can be time - ordered with the help of the metric @xmath16 , and causality may be preserved even if the field propagates superluminally .",
    "the gravitational metric field @xmath7 is just one particular field on @xmath1 and there is no clear reasons why it should be favored .",
    "let us finally stress that the three conditions ( a)(c ) are actually not sufficient to guarantee ( usual ) causality .",
    "indeed , if information were allowed to travel as well forward as backward in time , as it is the case in any time reversal invariant theories , then it would be always possible to have information running along a closed curve in spacetime .",
    "thus the absence of cftc does not suffice to guarantee the usual notion of causality , unless one specifies that a _ flow _ of time exists and that information can only go forward in time .",
    "the three points ( a)(c ) are clearly time - reversal invariant statements and therefore can not address this issue .",
    "note that both classical and quantum field theories are time - reversal invariant so that they may not be considered as `` causal '' in the usual sense .",
    "the emergence of the flow of time from thermodynamics in quantum field theory is a quite involved question that we will not consider here . in the present paper",
    ", we will therefore restrict ourselves to such a time - reversal invariant notion of causality , but one should keep in mind that thermodynamics may be the key to understand fully the ( coarse - grained ) notion of causality .      we stressed that superluminal behaviors are automatically discarded by the above postulate .",
    "one may try to justify it by arguing that , since @xmath7 reduces locally to @xmath10 and therefore gives to the tangent space its special relativistic ( minkowskian ) structure , going faster than gravitons would `` undermine the entire framework of relativity theory '' @xcite . let us however stress that any other metric @xmath16 can also be reduced locally to its fundamental form in adapted `` inertial '' coordinates .",
    "these coordinates transform under the action of the lorentz group @xmath22 with an invariant speed @xmath23 _ that can differ from _",
    "@xmath0 , if the cones of @xmath16 and @xmath7 do not coincide [ due for instance to some spontaneous breaking of local lorentz invariance , see sec .  [ causatheoriessuperluminiques ] ] .",
    "these coordinates are actually relevant if one uses rods and clocks made of the field @xmath17 that propagates along @xmath13 .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 reduces locally to the flat spacetime metric can therefore not be used to claim that @xmath7 should be a preferred field on @xmath1 .",
    "we will come back to this important point later , see sec .",
    "[ bimetricsuperlum ] .",
    "we may therefore drop the above postulate and look for a minimal expression of causality in which no prior chronology is assumed .",
    "let us consider a collection of fields @xmath15 that propagate along some metrics @xmath16 ( gravity included ) .",
    "we are led to the picture of a finite set of `` causal '' cones at each points of spacetime .",
    "we do not want to prefer one metric with respect to the others , because there is no reason why , locally , some sets of coordinates , or some rods and clocks should be preferred : coordinates are meaningless in gr .",
    "the cones defined by the metrics @xmath16 may therefore be in any relative position with respect to one another .",
    "moreover , these cones may even tip over each others depending on the location on spacetime .",
    "we have however to guarantee that no signal can propagate along a closed curve . for this",
    "it is not sufficient to require the global hyperbolicity of each spacetime ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "indeed , fields may interact together , and we may form a physical signal which propagates on spacetime along different metrics .",
    "we shall rather define a extended notion of future - directed timelike curves , by requiring that at each point of the curve , the tangent vector is future - directed timelike with respect to _ at least _",
    "one of the metrics @xmath16 .",
    "such a construction have been already advocated in @xcite .",
    "all the ( extended ) notions of future , past , domains of dependence , achronal sets , cauchy surfaces , global hyperbolicity then follow .",
    "this corresponds to a `` mixed '' notion of chronology : a point @xmath25 is in the ( extended ) future of @xmath26 if it is in the future of @xmath26 for at least one of the metrics @xmath16 , see fig .",

    "a spacetime interval is thus spacelike in the extended sense if it is spacelike with respect to _ all _ metrics @xmath16 .",
    "the hatched part shows the extended future defined by two metrics ( solid and dashed lines ) in the case where one metric defines a wider cone than the other one ( left ) , and in the opposite case ( right).,width=6 ]    causality then requires that a global ( mixed ) chronology on spacetime exists . in other words , spacetime must be globally hyperbolic in that extended sense .",
    "this straightforward generalization enables us to express the miniminal formulation of causality by the following properties :    1 .   the mixed chronology defined by the set of metrics @xmath16 must be a global chronology on spacetime .",
    "the whole set of equations of motion must admit a well - posed cauchy problem .",
    "the formulation of causality ( a)(c ) is immediately obtained from these more general requirements whenever the matter light cones coincide or lie within the gravitational one .",
    "we thus see that fields can propagate superluminally without threatening causality provided that we do not refer to any preferred chronology on spacetime .",
    "the cauchy problem of some field @xmath17 will be well posed depending on the precise equation of motion , and if initial data are set on surfaces that are spacelike with respect to the metric @xmath13 along which it propagates .",
    "moreover , if we are interested in the whole theory ( gravity included ) , the cauchy problem will be well posed if initial data are set on surfaces that are spacelike in the extended sense , that is _ spacelike with respect to all metrics @xmath16 _ ) .",
    "it must be stressed that , in gr , the fact that @xmath7 defines a global chronology can not be proved , for the reason that local physics does not determine the topology of spacetime , which could however prevent the existence of a global chronology .",
    "this the case for instance , of non time - orientable spacetimes .",
    "moreover , there exists exact solutions to the einstein equations that do not describe globally hyperbolic spacetimes , as explicitly shown by the kerr solution , which possess closed timelike curves , or gdel s universe .",
    "einstein equations thus admit solutions that violate causality .",
    "this difficulty is entirely subsumed into the so - called chronology protection conjecture @xcite that asserts that the local laws of physics are such that they prevent the formation of cftcs in spacetime .",
    "this has not been proved yet , so that we usually assume from the beginning that spacetime ( @xmath27 ) is globally hyperbolic .",
    "as long as the conjecture is not proved , such a restriction is not dynamical , but of epistemological nature@xcite .",
    "let us stress that in our extended framework , and notably in presence of superluminal matter fields , we will not be able to prove either that the condition ( a ) holds .",
    "we will have to _ assume _ that spacetime is globally hyperbolic in the extended sense . again , if we were able to prove the chronology protection conjecture , we would not have to make such a non trivial assumption .",
    "we will discuss further this point in sec .",
    "[ kessencesglobal ] .    in other words , the condition ( a ) will have to be imposed by hand , just as in gr .",
    "as we already explained , we will not consider the issue of the existence of the flow of time , and thus , in the following , we will mostly be concerned by the point ( b ) .",
    "we provide in the next section two examples of theories that do not admit a well - posed cauchy problem .",
    "it enables us to show the deep relationship between non causal behaviors , closed curves in spacetime and constraints on initial data .",
    "an obviously non causal theory is an elliptic klein - gordon scalar field with an equation of motion @xmath28 , and where the metric @xmath13 has the signature @xmath29 .",
    "this elliptic equation does not have a well posed cauchy problem .",
    "it can be simply interpreted as the fact that this euclidean metric does not select the time coordinate as special compared to the spatial one .",
    "there is thus no available notion of propagation and initial data on three - surfaces can not be propagated in four dimensions . on the contrary , a lorentzian signature for @xmath13 guarantees that the equation is hyperbolic and",
    "that , by virtue of well - known theorems @xcite , the cauchy problem is well posed .",
    "we consider now the more interesting case of tachyonic particles . by tachyons we mean particles or signals that can be sent at a superluminal speed relative to the emitter ) ] . as correctly recognized in many papers in the literature , tachyons are not causal ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . indeed",
    ", they can always be used construct closed curves in spacetime along which a ( tachyonic ) signal propagate .",

    "let us also stress that without such a postulate , the notion of superluminal behavior becomes itself irrelevant .",
    "the only point , as far as bimetric theories are concerned , is actually that the ratio of the speed of gravitational waves to the speed of photons for instance , vary in space and time .",

    "conventional physics did not succeeded so far in explaining the anomalous motion of the two pioneer spacecrafts @xcite that experience a small anomalous acceleration ( roughly directed towards the sun ) .",
    "unconventional theories of gravity could however explain it .",
    "the two pioneer spacecrafts are moving along geodesics of the matter metric @xmath6 , and we shall look for a slight modification of the schwarzschild solution to explain the pioneer anomaly .",
    "it is worth noting that this anomaly was detected soon after jupiter s flyby @xcite so that we have to check that the suggested modification is compatible with the motion of outer planets .",
    "outer planets are moving along quasi - circular orbits , and are thereby mostly sensitive to the time - time component of the matter metric @xmath142 .",
    "very sensitive tests of kepler s third law @xcite then put stringent bounds on the deviation from the leading order of the time - time component of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "these bounds are actually too small to account for the pioneer anomaly .",
    "this fact leads to the wrong statement in @xcite that the pioneer anomaly can not be of gravitational origin .",
    "this is indeed not justifiable since the two spacecrafts evolve on hyperbolic trajectories and are thereby also sensitive to the radial - radial component of the matter metric , which is not well constrained in the outer solar system .",
    "let us stress that , if spherical symmetry is assumed , a slight modification of @xmath143 compared to the schwarzschild solution is the only way to give the pioneer anomaly a gravitational origin in a metric theory of gravity .",
    "this was notably realized in @xcite .",
    "here we provide , with the help of bimetric theories of gravity , a framework that realizes this modification of the radial - radial component .",
    "the action of the theory is given by the eintein - hilbert action , a canonical action for the scalar field , and the matter fields are coupled to the matter metric @xmath144 where @xmath57 is still defined by eq .",
    "( [ defdex ] ) .",
    "as we already stressed , non trivial properties of @xmath30 , @xmath32 and energy conditions of the matter sector may be required to ensure the hyperbolicity of the scalar equation inside matter .",
    "in addition , the matter metric has to be lorentzian and this reads @xmath145 . in a static and spherical symmetric situation",
    ", we have @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the bare metric @xmath7 is given by the solution of einstein equations and it can be shown that it coincides with the schwarzschild solution to the leading order .",
    "this theory is thus a realization of the above phenomenology .",
    "such models predict `` pioneer - like '' anomalies in the precession of perihelion that could notably be found in precise measures of the orbit of mars .",
    "more details on the pioneer anomaly and disformal theories can be found in @xcite .",
    "the first varying speed of light theories were constructed by replacing @xmath0 by @xmath8 in the equations of motion of gr , where @xmath148 could be the cosmic time @xcite .",
    "this however leads to equations of motion that do not conserve stress - energy anymore .",
    "in other words , this theory can not be obtained from a variational principle @xcite .",
    "some authors thus made use of the disformal matter metric eq .",
    "( [ metriquedisfscalaire ] ) to reproduce vsl within a consistent framework @xcite .",
    "note that in all of these models , the free functions were taken as constants @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "let us stress that if one insists on the weak equivalence principle there can not be any coupling between @xmath2 and the standard model matter other than through the matter metric .",
    "then , by varying the action with respect to @xmath2 , one finds that the scalar field is not created by the matter sources ( @xmath151 is always a solution ) .",
    "the scalar field can only be generated by some ( non constant ) function @xmath152 , like in scalar - tensor theories .",
    "note also that the choice of @xmath153 in these works does not guarantee the lorentzian character of the matter metric , which can actually be euclidean in a cosmological background such that @xmath154 .",
    "one could however circumvent this problem by arguing that the theory is only an effective model valid for @xmath155 , and where @xmath50 could be of the order of the gut s scale .",
    "as we already stressed , the initial value formulation of the scalar field equation in such models is a quite involved question .",
    "this point has not been pointed out although the existence of an initial value formulation is a basic requirement that must be checked in order to give any sense to such vsl models .",
    "let us finally remark that , since the fine structure constant @xmath93 is proportional to the inverse of the speed of light , it has been argued that vsl theories could also account for the variation of @xmath93 with cosmic time , if any @xcite .",
    "however , in this bimetric framework of vsl theories , if one analyzes atomic rays at some redshift by usual techniques , one is observing electromagnetic phenomenon using matter rods and clocks , so that no variations of @xmath93 are actually observable .",
    "the fact that the ratio of the speed of light to the speed of gravitational waves varies in space and time does not lead to a variation of @xmath93 ( if it is measured in the usual way ) , but simply to a redefinition of the redshift @xmath156 of distant objects .",
    "we provided a careful analysis of the meaning of causality in classical field theories .",
    "this led us to the conclusion that superluminal behaviors are generically found to be non causal _ only if _ one refers to a _",
    "prior _ chronology on spacetime .",
    "this postulate actually states that , locally , some sets of inertial coordinates must be preferred ones , and this appears to be in great conflict with the spirit of general relativity , and more precisely with the spirit of general covariance . on the contrary , we derived in sec .",
    "[ causalityandsuperluminalbehav ] , by means of the conditions ( a)(c ) , a formulation of causality in which coordinates are still physically meaningless .",
    "note that while referring to a preferred chronology may seem natural in gr since all fields ( both gravity and matter ) propagate along the gravitational metric @xmath7 , it becomes somewhat unnatural whenever spontaneous breaking of lorentz invariance occur , be it driven by quantum polarization ( and in general , the solution of field equations ) , nonlinearities of some new fields , etc .",
    "the resulting spacetime is generically endowed with a finite set of lorentzian metrics @xmath16 which may not be conformally related to each others . in that case rods and clocks made of different fields lead to different systems of",
    "coordinate that do not transform under the same lorentz group .",
    "there is not only one , but at least two invariant speeds in that case .",
    "note that it would be misleading to think that there is a preferred lorentz invariance in the theory because of the symmetry of the action .",
    "actually , in a gr - like context , the action is not lorentz invariant but diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "this notably means that all local system of coordinates are equivalent . on the contrary",
    ", the existence of a preferred chronology means that ( as far as causality is concerned ) there exists some preferred class of inertial coordinates , or equivalently some preferred rods and clocks .",
    "this seems to be physically unacceptable .    as a consequence , one _ can not _",
    "refer to causality in order to assert that nothing can travel faster than one of these speeds .",
    "accordingly , causality does not require one of these metric to define a wider cone than the others everywhere on spacetime .",
    "bimetric theories of gravity greatly enlightened this point , since both the gravitational and the matter metric could be used to define a `` natural '' chronology on spacetime .",
    "depending on the choice made , one then finds that nothing can travel faster than gravity or light .",
    "these two opposite requirements can be found in the literature .    on the contrary ,",
    "our definition of causality in which no prior chronology is assumed ( by means of our `` mixed '' chronology , see sec.[causalityandsuperluminalbehav ] ) , enables a causal theory to involve `` superluminal '' propagations . actually",
    "the very notion of superluminal behavior is no more meaningful in that framework , and the only point is that some degrees of freedom can propagate faster than other ones .",
    "moreover the causal cones may even tip over each other depending on the location on spacetime . as an application , in k - essences theories",
    ", causality does _ not _ require the sign of @xmath157 to be fixed ( and notably negative ) , and , in bimetric theory causality does not require either the gravitational light - cone to be wider than the matter one ( nor conversely ) .",
    "what actually requires causality is first that the equations of motion have a well - posed cauchy problem .",
    "this strongly depends on the precise form of the dynamics , and throughout this paper we used classical results @xcite on that subject .",
    "we also discussed in detail the fact that global properties of spacetimes may break causality .",
    "we pointed out that this already occurs in standard gr _ so that it can not be related to some intrinsic disease of superluminal propagation_. we discuss three very similar cases : gott s cosmic strings @xcite , the two bubbles of non trivial vacua in k - essences theories @xcite and the two casimir experiments of @xcite .",
    "what thus became clear was that such non trivial global properties may be actually suppressed by subtle boundaries effects .",
    "this would be an illustration of the chronology protection conjecture .",
