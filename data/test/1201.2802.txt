    "various proposals for quantum gravity such as string theory , loop quantum gravity , quantum geometry , and black - hole physics all agree on the the existence of a minimum measurable length of the order of the planck length @xmath2 where @xmath3 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "it can solve the renormalizability problem of relativity which is related to the field theoretical ultraviolet divergences in the theory .",
    "indeed , beyond the planck energy scale , the effects of gravity are so important which would result in discreteness of the very spacetime",
    ". however , by introducing a minimal length as an effective cutoff in the ultraviolet domain , the theory can be renormalizable .",
    "the introduction of this idea in the form of the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) has attracted much attention in recent years and many papers have been appeared in the literature to address the effects of gup on various quantum mechanical systems @xcite . in doubly special relativity theories , we consider the planck energy as an additional invariant beside the velocity of light @xcite . a gup which is consistent with these theories",
    "is also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the problem of the quantum bouncer in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle in the form @xmath0=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^{2})$ ] where @xmath1 is the gup parameter . in ordinary quantum mechanics ,",
    "the energy levels of a test particle which is bouncing elastically and vertically on the earth s surface should be quantized as a manifestation of the particle - wave duality .",
    "this effect has been confirmed a few years ago using a high precision neutron gravitational spectrometer . using the perturbative representations ,",
    "the effects of the minimal length and/or maximal momentum on the quantum bouncer spectrum are also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we use two equivalent nonperturbative representations which exactly satisfy the modified commutation relation and find the gup corrected energy spectrum of the quantum bouncer .",
    "therefore , we can relax the assumption of the smallness of the gup parameter and obtain the solutions for arbitrary values of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the semiclassical results agree well with the quantum mechanical results even for the low lying states .",
    "let us consider a generalized uncertainty principle which results in a minimum observable length @xmath4 where @xmath1 is the gup parameter and @xmath5 is a positive constant that depends on the expectation values of the momentum operator .",
    "we also have @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the planck mass and @xmath8 is of order one .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the inequality relation ( [ gup ] ) implies the existence of a minimum observable length as @xmath9 . in the context of string theory",
    ", we can interpret this length as the length of the string where it is proportional to the square root of the gup parameter . in one dimension",
    ", the above uncertainty relation can be obtained from the following deformed commutation relation @xmath10=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for @xmath11 we recover the well - known commutation relation in ordinary quantum mechanics . now using eqs .",
    "( [ gup ] ) and ( [ gupc ] ) , we find the explicit form of @xmath5 as the expectation value of the momentum operator i.e. @xmath12 . as kempf , mangano , and mann ( kmm )",
    "have suggested in their seminal paper , in momentum space representation , we can write @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are symmetric operators on the dense domain @xmath16 with respect to the following scalar product : @xmath17 also we have @xmath18 and @xmath19 . with this definition , the commutation relation ( [ gupc ] )",
    "is exactly satisfied .",
    "note that the kmm representation is not unique and we can use another representation using appropriate canonical transformations . for instance , consider the following exact representation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 obey the canonical commutation relation @xmath23=i\\hbar$ ] .",
    "note that , in contrary to the kmm representation , this representation is formally self - adjoint and preserves the ordinary nature of the position operator .",
    "moreover , this definition exactly satisfies the condition @xmath0=i\\hbar(1+\\beta p^2)$ ] and agrees with the well - known perturbative proposal @xcite @xmath24 to the first order of the gup parameter .",
    "indeed , the two representations are equivalent and they are related by the following canonical transformation : @xmath25x,\\\\ p&\\rightarrow&\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\beta}p\\right)/\\sqrt{\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which transforms eqs .",
    "( [ x0p01 ] ) and ( [ x0p02 ] ) to eqs .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) subjected to eq .",
    "( [ gupc ] ) .",
    "we can interpret @xmath14 and @xmath22 as follows : @xmath22 is the momentum operator at low energies ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath14 is the momentum operator at high energies .",
    "obviously , this procedure affects all hamiltonians in quantum mechanics .",
    "consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath27 which using eqs .",
    "( [ x0p01 ] ) and ( [ x0p02 ] ) can be written exactly and perturbatively as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the @xmath31th bernoulli number .",
    "the corrected terms in the modified hamiltonian are only momentum dependent and are proportional to @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , the presence of these terms leads to a positive shift in the energy spectrum . in the quantum domain ,",
    "this hamiltonian results in the following generalized schrdinger equation in quasiposition representation @xmath34 where @xmath35 and the second term is due to the gup corrected terms in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) .",
    "although the quantum stationary states of matter in the gravitational field is theoretically possible , the observation of such quantum effect is very difficult experimentally .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gravitational quantum effects are negligible for macroscopic objects and for charged particles the electromagnetic interaction has the dominate role .",
    "so we should use neutral elementary particles with a long lifetime such as neutrons .",
    "a few years ago , a famous measurement is performed by nesvizhevsky et al . using a high precision neutron gravitational spectrometer @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "the quantization of energy of ultra cold neutrons bouncing above a mirror in the earth s gravitational field was demonstrated .      here",
    ", we are interested to study the effects of the minimal length on the energy spectrum of a particle of mass @xmath36 which is bouncing vertically and elastically on a reflecting hard floor so that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the acceleration in the earth s gravitational field . in ordinary quantum mechanics ( @xmath11 ) , this problem is exactly solvable and the eigenfunctions can be written in the form of the airy functions .",
    "moreover , the energy eigenvalues are related to the zeros of the airy function . in the semiclassical approximation",
    ", the energy eigenvalues can be obtained using the bohr - sommerfeld formula as @xmath39 ^ 2\\right)^{1/3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is valid with a high degree of accuracy of @xmath40 even for the lowest quantum state . however , for @xmath41 the situation is quite different .    in the presence of the minimal length , it is more appropriate to study the problem in the momentum space . because of the linear form of the potential",
    ", the generalized schrdinger equation can be cast into a first - order differential equation in this space .",
    "now we define a new variable @xmath42 and rewrite the generalized schrdinger equation ( [ h0 ] ) in the momentum space as @xmath43 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "this equation admits the following solution @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a constant and @xmath46 . to proceed further and for",
    "the sake of simplicity , let us work in the units of @xmath47 .",

    "as the figure shows , the energy spectrum increases in the presence of the minimal length i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "the calculated energy eigenvalues for the first ten states are also shown in table [ tab1 ] which confirms the positive shift in the energy levels of the quantum bouncer in the gup framework .    the wave function @xmath52 for @xmath11 ( black line ) , @xmath53 ( green line ) , @xmath54 ( red line ) , and @xmath55 ( blue line ) .",
