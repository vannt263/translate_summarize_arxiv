    "one of the main industrial applications of bitumen is as a binder in asphalt pavement  [ ] .",
    "bitumen links together mineral aggregates and filler particles to form a cohesive asphalt on the road surface . over the years",
    ", a chemical reaction takes place in bitumen increasing the number of heavy aromatic molecules  [ ] .",
    "this process is called chemical aging .",
    "the aromatic molecules in bitumen , especially the asphaltene molecules , tend to align to form nanoaggregates .",
    "the aging reaction leads also to an increase in the nanoaggregate size  [ ] correlated with an unwanted increase in bitumen viscosity and brittleness  [ ] .",
    "the change in bitumen mechanical properties , which go from `` liquid - like '' to more `` solid - like '' during chemical aging finally results in cracks in the pavement and road deterioration . to prevent or reverse the effects of chemical aging ,",
    "a first step is to gather more knowledge about the nanoaggregate structure and stability in bitumen .",
    "much progress has been made over the last 50 years in the experimental and numerical literature to determine the structure of the nanoaggregates and the conditions under which they are formed .",
    "one can cite in particular the design of the yen - mullins model  [ , ] describing the nanoaggregate structure , the determination of the critical nanoaggregate concentration in different solvents  [ , ] , the evaluation of the average size and polydispersity of a nanoaggregate  [ ] on the experimental side . on the numerical side , different stable conformations of nanoaggregates",
    "were identified depending on the asphaltene structure using molecular mechanical calculations  [ ] and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  [ ] .",
    "md simulations were also used to determine the molecular orientation inside the nanoaggregates  [ ] , and the effects of solvent and presence of other molecules on the nanoaggregate structure  [ ] . however , analytical models for the thermodynamics stability and dynamics of the nanoaggregates in relation to their structure are still quite rare , to the notable exception of ref .  [ ] .",
    "the purpose of this paper is precisely to suggest simple and generic models , which can reproduce md results on the nanoaggregate stability .",
    "we present molecular dynamics results concerning the nanoaggregate size in the stationary regime . in bitumen ,",
    "nanoaggregates are composed of asphaltene molecules , the most heavy and aromatic fraction in bitumen , but also of lighter aromatic molecules like resin and resinous oil  [ ] .",

    "before presenting the molecular dynamics ( md ) results on nanoaggregate stability , we mention a few details about the simulations and define precisely a nanoaggregate .      as mentioned in the introduction , the simulation method and molecular potentials are described in details in ref .",
    "only information necessary to understand the study on nanoaggregate stability carried out in the present paper is given here .",
    "the simulated system contains four types of molecule , chosen to resemble the sara classification  [ ] : a saturated hydrocarbon , a resinous oil molecule , which is denoted aromatic in the sara scheme , a resin molecule and an asphaltene molecule .",

    "the potential between the united atom units contains four terms : an intermolecular potential , corresponding to a lennard - jones potential with parameters @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 k , where @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant and three terms for the intramolecular potential .",

    "the parametrization of the intramolecular potential is described in details in refs  [ ] .",

    "the lennard - jones potential used in the md simulations mimics the @xmath16-stacking interaction observed between aromatic molecules experimentally .",
    "the alignment of aromatic molecules in bitumen is the basis of the nanoaggregate formation .",
    "the definition of a nanoaggregate is described in detail in ref .",
    "it is based on the following rule : two aromatic molecules are nearest neighbors in the same nanoaggregate if they are `` well - aligned '' and `` close enough '' .",
    "a nanoaggregate is composed of all molecules connected by this rule .",
    "moreover , the asphaltene molecule chosen in this model has two parts , a flat head and a flat body which can rotate with respect to each other .",
    "for this reason , aromatic molecules can align in the direction of an asphaltene body or in the direction of an asphaltene head , thus creating branched nanoaggregates .",
    "these branches can link together purely linear nanoaggregates .",
    "we believe this is one mechanism explaining the formation of clusters of nanoaggregates , also observed experimentally  [ ] . in this paper , we focus on purely linear nanoaggregates .",
    "it means that any aromatic molecules linked to an asphaltene head will not be considered as part of this asphaltene nanoaggregate .",
    "we define a linear aggregate as composed of asphaltene bodies , resin and resinous oil molecules , and not asphaltene heads because heads are the smallest parts and probably lead to the smallest interaction energy .",

    "[ fig : pdfall ] .",
    "more specifically , the paper is aimed at unraveling some of the dynamical and thermodynamical origins lying behind the monoexponential and biexponential behaviors .",
    "a dynamical approach will first be proposed for the monoexponential behavior .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : pdfall ] ( b ) , the probability of having a nanoaggregate containing @xmath18 asphaltene molecules was shown to be monoexponential .",
    "the aim of this section is to establish a simple aggregation mechanism reproducing this behavior .",
    "the mechanism will be used to derive a master equation which provides a dynamical framework for understanding the monoexponential behavior .",
    "a simple mechanism which can be written in the asphaltene aggregation problem is @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes an aggregate containing @xmath18 asphaltene molecules .",
    "the assumptions lying behind this mechanism are the following : only one asphaltene molecule at a time can attach to or detach from an existing aggregate , the medium is homogeneous and the aggregation dynamics is not limited by diffusion .",
    "the same mechanism was already suggested in ref .",
    "[ ] to model asphaltene aggregation from a thermodynamical point of view , but the possibility to obtain a master equation from this mechanism and consequently to model the dynamics of asphaltene aggregation was left aside .    to obtain a master equation linked to this aggregation reaction",
    ", we make supplementary assumptions : the reaction rate constants do not depend on the size @xmath18 of the aggregate and the attachment rate does not depend on the probability of having free asphaltene molecules in the medium . under these assumptions , the master equation linked to the aggregation reaction  eq .",
    "can be written as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the attachment rate constant , @xmath44 the detachment rate constant and @xmath45 the probability of having an aggregate containing @xmath18 asphaltene molecules at time @xmath46 , given that its initial size was @xmath47 .",
    "the probability denoted @xmath31 in sec .",
    "[ sec : mdresults ] corresponds to the stationary state to eqs .   and   and depends neither on time @xmath46 nor on the initial condition @xmath47 .",
    "the master equation eq .",
    "was solved analytically in the 1950 s  [ , ] for different boundary conditions . this master equation and its generalized version in which the rate constants depend on the aggregate size @xmath18",
    "have also been extensively used to model different stochastic processes such as alcohol clusters  [ , ] , biological adhesion clusters  [ ] or aggregation in freeway traffic  [ ] , to cite only a few .",
    "the expression of this master equation deserves some further clarification in connection to the specific aggregation reaction used . following the law of chemical kinetics ,",
    "the attachment rate linked to the aggregation mechanism   should be @xmath48 , because the probability of having a collision between two small spherical molecules is usually proportional to the product of their concentrations .",
    "we can give empirical reasons explaining why it is not proportional to the probability @xmath49 of having a free asphaltene molecule here .",
    "we assume that the attachment rate is not due to the collision between two small spherical molecules , but limited by the steric hindrance around the aggregate and the orientation of the free asphaltene molecule @xmath50 .",
    "the attachment reaction is successful if the free asphaltene molecule is well oriented and placed at a reactive end of the aggregate .",
    "the number of free asphaltene molecules is higher than the number of any aggregate of a given size at any time in our md simulations ( not shown ) .",
    "as the number of free asphaltene molecules is high enough , there is always a free asphaltene molecule nearby an aggregate but it is not always well - oriented and prevent other molecules from approaching due to the density of the system .",
    "thus , the attachment rate is independent of the free asphaltene concentration and the attachment rate constant @xmath43 is averaged over possible orientations . the boundary condition  eq",
    ".   needs also some explanation .",
    "it corresponds to the fact that the system is closed . in other words ,",
    "the total number of asphaltene molecules is kept constant .",
    "as the free asphaltene molecules are involved in each aggregation reaction  , the derivative with respect to time of the probability @xmath51 to have a free asphaltene molecule depends on infinitely many terms .",

    "the probability of having a nanoaggregate containing @xmath18 asphaltene molecules depends neither on time nor on the initial size of a nanoaggregate . for this reason , the stationary probability",
    "will be denoted @xmath31 .",
    "it satisfies the following equation : @xmath54 the solution of this equation is a geometrical law  [ , ] . by induction and using the fact that @xmath55",
    ", one can show that the solution of this equation is : @xmath56 in a log - lin scale , the stationary probability predicted by the master equation approach is a straight line of the form : @xmath57 it is a monoexponential distribution , as observed in fig .  [",

    "the exponential distribution can be used to fit the molecular dynamics data , as shown in fig .  [",

    "the value of the dynamical parameter @xmath58 is , in this case , @xmath59 .",
    "the master equation framework provides a dynamical interpretation of the parameter @xmath58 as the ratio between the attachment and detachment rate constants .",
    "figure  [ fig : aonlybb ] also shows the probability of having a nanoaggregate containing @xmath18 asphaltene molecules obtained in md simulations for two different system sizes and the corresponding exponential fits .",
    "the results for a system containing @xmath1 asphaltene molecules and for a system containing @xmath60 times less molecules agree surprisingly well , giving the values @xmath59 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "it shows that , while finite size effects are present , they are not very important when it comes to the number of asphaltene molecules in a nanoaggregate . more specifically , the relative probability of small nanoaggregates is accurately described even in the small system .",
    "the probability of having larger nanoaggregates is not so well described in the small system , as expected , but does not affect much the value of the parameter @xmath58 since these nanoaggregates are rare even in the large system .",
    "it is important to note , however , that physical properties due to large nanoaggregates or to nanoaggregates filling up the box in one direction , such as residual stresses , could be affected by finite size effects .",
    "as shown above , the stationary state predicted by the master equation agrees with the md results on the probability of having a nanoaggregate containing @xmath18 asphaltene molecules .",
    "if the master equation  eq .   correctly describes the aggregation process , it should also reproduce the aggregation dynamics .",

    ", we quantified the aggregation dynamics in the following way .",
    "we used the fraction @xmath62 of aggregated asphaltene molecules versus time .",
    "the fraction @xmath62 of aggregated asphaltene molecules is defined as the ratio of the number of asphaltene molecules in all aggregates containing at least two asphaltene molecules and the total number of asphaltene molecules in the system .",
    "the fraction @xmath62 verifies : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the fraction of free asphaltene molecules .",
    "the fraction of free asphaltene molecules is defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of asphaltene molecules in aggregate containing one asphaltene molecule and @xmath67 is the total number of asphaltene molecules in the system .",
    "the fraction @xmath64 can be expressed in terms of the probability @xmath68 of having an asphaltene aggregate of size @xmath69 at time @xmath46 and of the average size of an asphaltene aggregate @xmath70 , given that all aggregates had size 1 initially .",

    "the initial state in the molecular dynamics simulations is not as well defined as in the master equation approach . to reach the desired density , a first md simulation where the system is compressed is performed . during the compression period ,",
    "the asphaltene molecules begin to aggregate , but the data can not be recorded .",
    "the data are recorded just after the compression period , in a state where small asphaltene aggregates are already formed .",
    "the fraction of free asphaltene molecules in that state is @xmath84 .",
    "it is a second fitting parameter .",
    "the curve predicted by the numerical implementation of the master equation was shifted in time so that time @xmath85 corresponds to @xmath84 as in the md simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : dynamics ] shows the fraction of aggregated asphaltene molecules versus time in the molecular dynamics simulations and in the master equation approach .",
    "both results agree well , indicating that the master equation approach correctly describe the aggregation process of asphaltene molecules .",
    "the value of the dynamical parameter @xmath43 is found to be @xmath86 s@xmath6 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the inverse rate constant @xmath87 s is much larger than the upper limit @xmath88 s , needed for an asphaltene molecule to diffuse of a distance equals to the average distance @xmath89 nm between the centers of mass of @xmath90 aromatic molecules in a homogeneous system of volume @xmath91 nm@xmath92 minus the intermolecular distance @xmath93 @xmath8 in an aggregate .",
    "this characteristic time is evaluated using the diffusion coefficient of a single asphaltene molecule in the docosane solvent : @xmath94 m@xmath95.s@xmath6 and the formula @xmath96 for three - dimensional diffusion .",
    "this time is an upper limit because only the distance between centers of mass is considered , whereas molecules are extended in space and can be close to each other even if the distance between their centers of mass is larger than @xmath97 .",

    "the aim of the present section is to describe a statistical mechanics model based on the same aggregation scheme and consistent with the monoexponential behavior . in this section",
    ", we will also look into possible thermodynamical interpretations of the biexponential behavior , obtained when all aromatic molecules are counted .      to formulate a simple statistical mechanics model linked to the aggregation reaction  eq .  , some assumptions are needed .",
    "we make the following common assumptions :    1 .",
    "the nanoaggregates are linear .",
    "2 .   the system is homogeneous and isotropic on average and the nanoaggregates are rigid .",
    "3 .   the aggregation process occurs at a characteristic time much larger than the equilibration of the pressure , temperature and solvent molecules .",
    "the system is dilute enough to consider no interaction between the nanoaggregates except through the aggregation reaction .",
    "in other words , the solution of nanoaggregates of different sizes in a solvent is ideal .",
    "the free energy of a nanoaggregate depends linearly on its size .",
    "the idea of considering a mixture of free molecules and dimers as an ideal mixture with an aggregation reaction occurring at a larger time scale dates back to the beginning of the 20@xmath98 century  [ ] as is nicely explained in the recent review  [ ] . the set of assumptions was then completed to include the case of linear aggregates of any size and widely used to describe rodlike micelles  [ ] , linear polymer chains  [ ] , and discotic liquid crystals  [ ] .",
    "we propose in this section our own version of the derivation applied to the case of linear asphaltene aggregates and obtain an analytical formula for the probability of having an aggregate of a given size .",
    "the analogy between linear assembly in discotic liquid crystals and asphaltene aggregates was also made in ref  [ ] , which derives very similar equations to the ones presented in this section , but do not present a successful comparison with their coarse - grained simulations of asphaltene - resin nanoaggregates at high density .",
    "the assumption of having an ideal mixture can be relaxed to take into account more complicated interactions between the aggregates such as excluded volume interactions  [ ] , the gain in entropy when the chain breaks  [ ] and interactions due to the flexibility of the aggregates [ ] , to cite only a few . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "these interactions are neglected in the case of linear asphaltene aggregates .",
    "the validity of the assumptions made in this section will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : assumption ] .",
    "concurrently to these approaches expressing the probability of having an aggregate of a given size , another theory of aggregation based on statistical thermodynamics was developed by wertheim  [ ] .",

    "this last trend matches the qualitative picture of small aggregates being more bent than larger aggregates .",
    "the change in the nanoaggregate composition observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dlatmc](c ) could explain the change in the nanoaggregate rigidity with the nanoaggregate size : aggregates containing many asphaltene molecules tend to be longer and more rigid .",
    "second , the system is not strictly isotropic .",
    "the isotropy was quantified using the nematic order parameter @xmath162  [ ] . to define the nematic order parameter , the following order tensor needs to be defined for each nanoaggregate : @xmath163 where @xmath18 is the number of molecules in the considered linear nanoaggregate , @xmath164 and @xmath165 cartesian coordinates , @xmath156 the index of a molecule inside the aggregate , @xmath155 the unit vector normal to molecule @xmath156 , and @xmath166 the kronecker delta .",
