    "long - distance soliton - based fibre transmission meets with difficulties imposed by random jitter in the soliton arrival time caused by the spontaneous amplifier noise ( the so - called gordon - haus effect  @xcite).the amplifier noise incorporated by the soliton produces a random soliton frequency shift which leads to a timing shift because of the group velocity dispersion .",
    "the gordon - haus effect limits error - free propagation of the soliton .",
    "there is a few ways to partially overcome the gordon - haus limit , including the use of linear filtering  @xcite , the dispersion compensation means  @xcite , the use of a sequence of two different media to reduce a path - averaged dispersion  @xcite .    from the viewpoint of the inverse scattering transform ,",
    "the theory of the gordon - haus effect is a direct consequence of the adiabatic soliton perturbation theory for the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , with perturbation being the amplifier noise  @xcite .",
    "the nls equation serves as the integrable model describing the picosecond soliton dynamics in fibres . on the other hand ,",
    "when dealing with ultrashort optical pulses with duration @xmath0 100 fs , the nls equation should be modified to adopt more subtle effects , such as the nonlinearity dispersion , the raman self - frequency shift and the third - order dispersion  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the account for the nonlinearity dispersion does not break the integrability of the equation . in other words , the modified nls ( mnls ) equation    @xmath1    is still integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform  @xcite , though the linear spectral problem associated with the mnls equation differs from that for the nls equation ( with @xmath2 ) .",
    "here @xmath3 is the normalized slowly varying amplitude of the electric field envelope , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the normalized propagation distance and time in the frame comoving with the group velocity , the real parameter @xmath6 governs the effect of the nonlinearity dispersion .",
    "we consider the mnls equation  ( [ 1 ] ) as the integrable model for ultrashort optical pulses , i.e. , playing the same role as the nls equation does for picosecond solitons .",
    "thereby , we change the status of the nonlinearity dispersion term from being a perturbation in the nls equation to the essential ingredient of the mnls equation .",
    "it is important that such a change is in no way an issue of our convenience .",
    "it was shown by ohkuma _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that numerical simulation of soliton propagation revealed a number of features which can not be accounted for by treating this term as a perturbation term in the nls equation .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite , the adiabatic perturbation theory for mnls solitons was elaborated .",
    "so , a question to analyze the gordon - haus effect for the mnls solitons arises naturally .    in this communication",
    ", we derive analytically the mean - square displacement fluctuation for the mnls soliton propagating in a fibre .",
    "it follows from our results that the gordon - haus effect for the mnls solitons , as distinct from the nls solitons , can be suppressed by properly adjusting the soliton / fibre parameters , without making use of external means . in the end of the paper",
    "we briefly discuss the suitability of this result to actual femtosecond solitons .",
    "we consider the perturbed mnls equation    @xmath7    where @xmath8 stands for spontaneous amplifier noise . in order to digress the details of minor importance ,",
    "we consider distributed gain that exactly compensates for the fibre loss .",
    "further , we consider the amplifier bandwidth to be much larger than the soliton bandwidth . because erbium - doped amplifiers have a gain bandwidth of the order of 40 nm  @xcite , this assumption works well for the ultrashort pulses .",
    "we consider the noise @xmath8 as the delta - correlated function both in time and space , @xmath9 the estimation of the coefficient @xmath10 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we treat the noise @xmath8 as being small to justify the perturbative approach .",
    "the unperturbed soliton of the mnls equation  ( [ 1 ] ) was derived as early as in 1983 by gerdjikov and ivanov  @xcite .",
    "we will use more simple and transparent expression  @xcite for the soliton solution of  ( [ 1 ] ) : @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are linearly expressed through coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath14 parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 determine initial position and initial phase of the soliton , the complex parameter @xmath17 , @xmath18 determines velocity ( more exactly , shift of the reciprocal soliton velocity ) @xmath19 and width @xmath20 of the soliton,@xmath21 where the @xmath4-dependence of the soliton velocity and width arises from the perturbation - induced @xmath4-dependence of the parameter @xmath22 ( see below  ( [ 8 ] ) ) .",
    "functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the direct analogs of the gordon s position and phase parameters for the nls soliton  @xcite .",
    "the soliton  ( [ 4 ] ) has a number of peculiarities which distinguish it from the nls soliton  @xcite .",
    "for example , the important invariant of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , namely , the optical energy@xmath25 has the upper limit @xmath26 .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath6 enters the denominator of the soliton solution  ( [ 4 ] ) ( because of @xmath20 ) , so we account non - perturbatively for the nonlinearity dispersion . in other words ,",
    "the parameter @xmath6 does not to be small in general .",
    "nevertheless , a non - trivial limiting procedure exists  @xcite permitting to restore from  ( [ 4 ] ) the nls soliton as @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , let us take the limit @xmath28 then it is easy to see that the soliton velocity and width  ( [ 6 ] ) transform in the limit  ( [ 7 ] ) as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , i. e. , to the nls parameters , while the mnls soliton  ( [ 4 ] ) produces exactly the nls soliton @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",

    "the responses are also expressed in the same form .",
    "we are mostly interested in the mean - square fluctuation @xmath39  ( @xmath40 being a fibre length ) of the soliton displacement @xmath23  ( [ 5 ] ) which is given in the presence of perturbation by @xmath41 with @xmath19 and @xmath42 determined from  ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the jitter of the soliton displacement in the comoving frame is calculated from @xmath43 where z - evolution of @xmath15 is given by @xcite@xmath44 @xmath45[s(x)e^{-i\\psi}-\\bar{s}(-x)e^{i\\psi } ] .",
    "\\noindent\\ ] ] since the soliton velocity and width enter eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) in the combination @xmath46 , we find from  ( [ 9 ] ) the noise source @xmath47:@xmath48 \\nonumber \\\\ & -&2\\bar{k}^{3}(v-\\frac{i}{w})\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx\\frac{e^{-x}% } { ( ke^{-x}+\\bar{k}e^{x})^{2}}[s(x)e^{-i\\psi}+\\bar{s}(-x)e^{i\\psi}]\\equiv s_{vw^{-1}}(z ) .",
    "\\label{12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , note that the mean - square fluctuation of the quantity @xmath49 caused by the noise source @xmath50 is determined by @xmath51 now we have everything to calculate the mean - square fluctuation of the soliton displacement .",
    "it is seen from  ( [ 10 ] ) that the mean - square fluctuation of the soliton displacement is produced by both the noise source @xmath52 driving the displacement directly and the fluctuations of the combination @xmath53 we consider noise sources as independent , so the fluctuations they produce are additive .",
    "this gives@xmath54 here@xmath55 and@xmath56 in turn , the correlation function for the velocity - to - width ratio is determined by the noise source @xmath47(12):@xmath57 straightforward calculation by means of eqs .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and  ( [ 12 ] ) gives@xmath58 with@xmath59 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & ( [ ( 1-\\alpha v)\\sec^{2}2\\gamma-2(1 - 2\\alpha v)]^{2}+(1 - 2\\alpha v)^{2}\\sec ^{2}2\\gamma)\\gamma\\cot2\\gamma\\ } .",
    "\\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the course of calculation , we ignore , because of smallness of noise sources , small variations of the parameter @xmath22 . thereby",
    ", the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 refer to their initial values .",
    "( remind that distributed gain compensates exactly for fiber losses ) .",
    "besides , we express the soliton width @xmath20 in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath61 due to the relation @xmath62 finally , we obtain from  ( [ 14 ] ) and  ( [ 13 ] ) the correlation function for the soliton displacement driven by fluctuations of the velocity - to - width ratio:@xmath63 similar calculation for the @xmath52-driven correlation @xmath64 in accordance with  ( [ 11 ] ) displays the linear growth with @xmath40 .",
    "hence , for large propagation distances the correlation function  ( [ 18 ] ) provides the main contribution to the total mean - square fluctuation of the soliton displacement .",
    "the above dependences on @xmath40 of the mean - square mnls soliton fluctuations coincide completely with those in the case of the nls soliton  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is a substantial difference between nls and mnls equations .",
    "while the correlation functions for the nls soliton do not contain soliton parameters ( in dimensionless units ) , these parameters enter explicitly into the r.h.s .",
    "of  ( [ 15 ] ) for the mnls equation .",
    "therefore , we can reduce the gordon - haus jitter for the mnls soliton by varying soliton parameters . in fig .",
    "1 we demonstrate this effect in terms of variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is seen that the function  ( [ 16 ] ) smoothly decreases when @xmath19 approaches @xmath65 .",
    "the role of the optical energy @xmath61 is depicted on fig .",
    "2 . as follows from  ( [ 17 ] ) , we have @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "it is seen that the function  ( [ 16 ] ) grows significantly for all @xmath61 for @xmath69 , while the same growth for @xmath67  is displayed to a lesser extent , including non - monotone behavior for small @xmath61 .",
    "as regards the applicability of the above result on the soliton jitter suppression to actual femtosecond optical solitons , we believe that the mnls equation is the true integrable model to start with the account for the third - order dispersion and the raman self - frequency shift .",
    "it should be noted that in the adiabatic approximation the third - order dispersion does not contribute to the mnls soliton velocity and width , just as for the nls soliton  @xcite .",
    "the raman effect contribution can be calculated additively as an extra perturbation to the mnls soliton , within the framework of the mnls soliton perturbation theory  @xcite . in so doing ,",
    "a value of @xmath6 should be carefully reconciled with the specific conditions of femtosecond pulse propagation .",
    "it is worth noting that there exists a possibility  @xcite to partially compensate for the raman self - frequency shift effect , as applied to femtosecond optical pulses .",
    "corresponding results will be published elsewhere .    in conclusion , we have shown that for solitons of the mnls equation which can serve as the integrable model for the description of ultrashort soliton dynamics , the gordon - haus jitter can be significantly reduced by means of matching soliton parameters alone .",
    "we stress that this reduction is non - perturbative with respect to @xmath6 , i.e. , it can not be revealed in the framework of the nls equation with @xmath6-dependent term considered as a perturbation .",
    "though the above result is valid within the adiabatic approximation of the mnls soliton perturbation theory , we believe it describes the main features of this phenomenon for ultrashort optical pulses ."
