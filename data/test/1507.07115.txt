    "multi - user mimo ( mu - mimo ) is a key building block of the next generation wireless communication system . in a mu - mimo downlink system , a base station ( bs ) equipped with multiple antennas",
    "simultaneously transmits data to a group of multiple antenna users .",
    "the multi - user interference , which is the major performance limiting factor of mu - mimo systems , must be managed intelligently using the physical layer techniques such as beamforming . in general , there are two major objectives in the beamformer design problem .",
    "one is to maximize a system utility ( e.g. , throughput ) under some power constraint , while the other one is to minimize the system transmission power subject to qos requirements @xcite .",
    "although both formulations are justifiable and well - studied , the latter is more appropriate for scenarios where the users need a guaranteed qos level .    although the qos - constrained power minimization ( qcpm ) problem is globally solvable in polynomial time for miso system @xcite , this problem is highly non - convex and difficult to solve in mimo systems . in fact",
    ", it has been shown that when the bss and the users are equipped with more than two antennas , the problem becomes np - hard @xcite .",
    "therefore , many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem approximately .",
    "for example , the references @xcite and @xcite propose algorithms based on interference nulling , which can completely eliminate the inter - user interference . in these algorithms ,",
    "the search space of transmit and receive beamformers is limited to zero forcing transceivers , leading to simple but suboptimal solutions .",
    "in addition , such interference nulling based methods require that the number of transmit antennas is no less than the total number of active users , which is impractical in many scenarios .",
    "another approach for solving the mu - mimo downlink qcpm problem is based on the iterative optimization methods @xcite .",
    "references @xcite provide iterative algorithms that update the transmit beamformers , receive beamformers , and transmit powers by switching between the downlink and the dual uplink channels .",
    "central to these methods is the notion of uplink - downlink duality ( udd ) theory @xcite , which guarantees that a set of target sinr levels is achievable in the downlink channel if and only if the same set of sinr levels is achievable in the corresponding dual uplink channel .",
    "we refer to such algorithms as udd algorithms .",
    "the udd algorithm was first proposed in @xcite for the multi - antenna case , where the _ receive _ ( resp .",
    "transmit ) beamformer update is followed immediately by the _ transmit _",
    "receive ) power update .",
    "the udd algorithm of @xcite differs from that of @xcite in the order of updating transmit / receive beamformers and powers . in the udd algorithm of @xcite , the _ transmit _ ( resp .",
    "receive ) power is updated exactly after the _ transmit _ ( resp .",
    "receive ) beamformer .",
    "importantly , it is shown in @xcite that the udd algorithm monotonically decreases the total power consumption while satisfying the qos constraints",
    ". however , the algorithms in @xcite can only apply to the _ single stream case_. in @xcite the udd algorithm has been generalized to the multiple stream case under the assumption of no joint detection at the receivers ( i.e. , _ inter - stream _ interference is considered ) .",
    "notice that , to the best of our knowledge , it is still not known whether the udd algorithm converges to a kkt solution .",
    "different from the previous works , the references @xcite and @xcite have proposed an iterative algorithm named mmse - socp , which aims to solve the qcpm problem directly .",
    "the algorithm consists of the following two key steps : 1 ) fixing the transmit power , update the receive beamformers using mmse receiver , and 2 ) fixing the receive beamformers , update the transmit beamformers by solving the power minimization problem with respect to the transmit beamformers .",
    "the authors show that the total transmit power monotonically decreases and thus converges .",
    "however , the convergence of the mmse - socp iterates to a kkt solution is not known .",
    "nevertheless , the authors of @xcite and @xcite observe that the mmse - socp algorithm always generates a sequence that converges to a unique solution , irrespective of the initial point ( or at least with high probability , see @xcite ) .",
    "hence , a conjecture has been made in @xcite , stating that the mmse - socp algorithm probably reaches a local optimum solution of the qcpm problem    in this paper , we settle the convergence issue related to the mmse - socp and the udd algorithm .",
    "we show that both algorithms converge globally to the set of kkt solutions , regardless of the number of streams intended for each user .",
    "we start by analyzing the kkt conditions of the qcpm problem of the single stream case . based on the analysis",
    ", we propose a novel iterative algorithm called mmse - dual algorithm , which is essentially equivalent to the mmse - socp algorithm , but with the added benefits of having almost closed form updates and a lower complexity . through the mmse - dual algorithm , we reveal some connections between the udd algorithm@xcite and the mmse - socp algorithm @xcite .",
    "more importantly we prove that both the mmse - dual algorithm and the udd algorithm monotonically converge to the set of kkt solutions of the qcpm problem .",
    "in addition , we extend the algorithms to the multiple stream case and prove that they can also reach a kkt point of the qcpm problem under some mild conditions .",
    "as will be seen later , the mmse - dual algorithm has a lower complexity than the udd algorithm if the number of streams is greater than the number of transmit antennas .",
    "moreover , although both algorithms require feasible initialization , it is easier for the mmse - dual algorithm to obtain a feasible initialization ( see remark [ rem : feasibility ] in section iv ) .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we give the formulation of the qcpm problem and provide a brief review of the existing algorithms . in section iii",
    "we propose the mmse - dual algorithm which reveals the relation between the mmse - socp and the udd algorithm .",
    "then , we state the convergence results of the three algorithms in section iv and extend the algorithms to the multiple stream case in section v. finally , section vi presents some simulation results and section vii concludes the paper .    _ notations _ : throughout this paper , we use uppercase bold letters for matrices , lowercase bold letters for column vectors , and regular letters for scalars . the superscript @xmath0 is used to denote the hermitian transpose of a matrix . for a complex number @xmath1 , @xmath2 and",

    "the sinrs for the downlink and uplink are respectively expressed as @xmath53 and @xmath54 then , fixing the beamformers , the _ downlink _ power minimization problem can be written as @xmath55 its dual problem can be obtained by using the lagrange duality theory with @xmath56 corresponding to the lagrangian multiplier of the @xmath17th qos constraint@xcite@xmath57 it can be shown that problem is equivalent to the following _ uplink _ weighted power minimization problem@xcite @xmath58 by noting that all the inequality constraints of both problem and must hold with equality at the optimality and furthermore the corresponding system of linear equations with respect to @xmath59 has a unique solution ( * ? ? ?",

    "this implies that , although the udd algorithm is developed from a different point of view , it works in a similar way as the mmse - dual algorithm towards solving the kkt system .",
    "furthermore , the constraints of problem must be satisfied with equality at the optimality .",
    "hence it is readily seen that the mmse - dual algorithm updates the auxiliary variables @xmath108 in the same way as the downlink transmission power @xmath133 in the udd algorithm ; see step 11 in table i and step 13 in table ii .",
    "the only difference between the two algorithms lies in the update of the dual variables @xmath128 ( or equivalently the dual uplink transmit power @xmath47 in udd ) . in the mmse - dual algorithm , the lagrange multipliers @xmath128",
    "are updated by the fixed point algorithm independent of the current transmit beamformers , while the update of uplink transmit power in the udd algorithm depends on the current transmission beamformers ; see steps 7 - 10 in table ii and step 7 in table i. note that , if problem is feasible , the update of the uplink transmit power in the udd algorithm is equivalent to solving a linear system of @xmath59 which has complexity of @xmath134 .",
