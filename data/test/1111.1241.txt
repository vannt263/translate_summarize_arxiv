    "as @xmath7 passes a threshold value of @xmath181 @xmath65 , a phase - dependent ( nonsmooth ) collision occurs between the smooth torus and the unstable part ( shown in gray ) of the nonsmooth ring - shaped unstable set .",
    "then , the new attractor of the system contains the attracting part ( shown in black ) of the ring - shaped unstable set and becomes nonsmooth , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra](e ) for @xmath182 @xmath65 [ see a magnified view in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra](f ) ] . as @xmath7 is further increased ,",
    "the chaotic component in the rational approximation to the attractor increases , and eventually for @xmath183 @xmath65 , it becomes suddenly widened via an interior crisis when it collides with the nearest ring [ _ e.g. , _ see fig .  [",
    "fig : ra](g ) ] .",
    "then , @xmath174 `` gaps , '' where no attractors with period @xmath176 exist , are formed .",
    "a magnified gap is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ra](h ) .",
    "we note that this gap is filled by intermittent chaotic attractors .",
    "thus , the rational approximation to the whole attractor consists of the union of the periodic and chaotic components . for this case ,",
    "the periodic component is dominant , and hence the average largest lyapunov exponent @xmath184 becomes negative , where @xmath185 denotes the average over the whole @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the rational approximation to the attractor becomes nonchaotic .",
    "we note that the 7th rational approximation to the attractor in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra](g ) resembles the ( original ) intermittent sn attractor in fig .",
    "[ fig : int](b ) , although the level of the rational approximation is low . in this way",
    ", the intermittent transition to an sn attractor occurs through two steps in the rational approximation : the phase - dependent ( nonsmooth ) collision and the interior crisis .",
    "we have numerically studied dynamical responses of the quasiperiodically forced hh neural oscillator and compared them with those for the periodically forced case . for the case of periodic forcing , a transition from a periodic to a chaotic oscillation has been found to occur via period doublings in both numerical and experimental works .",
    "effect of the quasiperiodic forcing on this period - doubling route to chaotic oscillation has been investigated .",
    "in contrast to the case of periodic forcing , new type of sn oscillating states have been found to exist between the regular and chaotic oscillating states as intermediate ones . due to their strange geometry ,",
    "these sn oscillations lead to the occurrence of aperiodic complex spikings , as in the case of chaotic oscillations .",
    "hence , sn oscillating states might be a dynamical origin for the complex spikings which are usually observed in cortical neurons .",
    "various routes to sn oscillations via fractalization , collision with a smooth unstable torus , and collision with a nonsmooth ring - shaped unstable set have been identified , as in the quasiperiodically forced logistic map @xcite .",
    "these sn responses are also found to occur in other neurons exhibiting period - doubling route to chaos ( _ e.g. , _ the morris - lecar neuron and the fitzhugh - nagumo neuron ) under quasiperiodic stimulus @xcite . finally , we suggest an experiment on the quasiperiodically forced squid giant axon and expect that sn spikings to be observed . however , the real biological environment is a noisy one .",
    "hence , it is necessary to further investigate the effect of noise on the sn response for real experiment .",
    "this type of investigation is beyond the scope of the the present paper , and hence it is left as a future work .",
