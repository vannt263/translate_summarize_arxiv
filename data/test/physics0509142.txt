    "empirical analysis of high - frequency financial data have been attracting significant interest among physicists as well as economists during a decade ( mantegna and stanley 2000 , and dacorogna 2001 ) .",
    "many features of financial markets have been clarified by many successive studies .",
    "actually it is well - known that the markets have a characteristic time scale in long period ( daily , weekly , and monthly ) .",
    "however recent studies ( takayasu 2003 , ohnishi 2004 and mizuno 2004 ) on time - series analyses in financial markets show that the market has a characteristic time scale in short period and propose the reason why traders are mainly using strategies with weighted feedbacks of past prices . furthermore using the self - modulation process takayasu _",
    "et al . _ have found that the characteristic time scale is about 2 minutes in the jpy / usd market ( takayasu 2003 ) ( abbreviated as mt ) .    on the other hand baninec and krawiech and host",
    "proposed a possibility that stochastic resonance occurs in markets ( babinec 2002 and krawiech 2003 ) through an ising - like agent model .",
    "they suggest that a periodicity in the market results from exogenous periodical information ( abbreviated as bkh ) .    in order to clarify the mechanism of this characteristic time",
    "i think that we should examine it on a different standpoint from mt and bkh .",
    "both studies focus on prices or price returns .",
    "however , in this article , we focus on the number of tick quotes in foreign currency rates ( usd / jpy ) and investigate the statistical properties of them by utilizing the power spectrum technique . as the results of examining the number of tick quotes in usd / jpy market it is found that the power spectrum density ( psd ) has some peaks at about 2 minutes ( the peak frequency depends on the currency markets ) .    in order to explain this phenomena a simple agent model based on double - threshold noisy device ( sato 2004 ) is proposed . from a result of numerical simulations of the model it is found that the high periodicity of the number of tick quotes may happen .",
    "this result leads to a hypothesis that this periodicity is caused by common exogenous periodical information .",
    "the purposes of this study are as follows : ( 1 ) to examine the number of high - frequency quotes lead us to deeply understand microscopic market activities .",
    "( 2 ) this may provide useful information for market players to consider their trading strategy .",
    "the number of ask quotes per minute in usd / jpy is counted for a period of 1998 to 2000 . utilizing the data we calculated three psds for 2,048 points in weekday and average them over the year .",
    "the averaged power spectrums on the semi - log scale are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerspectrum ] .",
    "they all have a peak at 0.4 ( 1/min ) , namely 2.5 minutes .",
    "we consider that these peaks exhibit characteristic time scales of dealers activities , i.e. , the dealers act having the periodicity of 2.5 minutes .",
    "we introduce a simple agent model based on double - threshold noisy devices in order to understand the characteristic time scales found in the averaged power spectrum density .",
    "this model contains @xmath0 dealers and the @xmath1th dealer has double - threshold ( @xmath2 ) to decide buy(1 ) , sell(-1 ) and wait(0 ) , and noise source @xmath3 to model an uncertainty in their mind .",
    "we assume that the @xmath1th dealer must choose a decision ( output ) into the three ones @xmath4 based on information ( input ) @xmath5 with an uncertainty @xmath6 in his / her mind :    @xmath7    here we assume that @xmath3 is identically independent gaussian distribution ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 are standard deviations of the @xmath1th dealer .",
    "it is assumed that the input of each dealer is exogenous periodic information @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents an amplitude , and @xmath12 a frequency . for @xmath13",
    "the dealers feel it good news and tend to decide a buy , while for @xmath14 they do it bad news and to decide a sell .",
    "furthermore the number of tick quotes per unit time @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16    for simplicity assume @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "obviously the activity @xmath15 is always zero if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , so that , there is no uncertainty of the dealers in their mind and the exogenous information is weaker than the threshold for the dealers to decide their action .",
    "however if there is uncertainty @xmath21 then the activity @xmath15 can exhibit periodicity despite of @xmath20 due to stochastic resonance ( see gammaitoni hnggi jung and marchesoni ( 1998 ) ) .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] it is found that the psd has some peaks from numerical simulations of the dealer model for @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "this peak is caused by stochastic resonance .     at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "it has a peak at 0.4 . ]",
    "we empirically investigate the number of the tick quotes per unit time in foreign currency market ( usd / jpy ) .",
    "it is found that the power spectrum densities of them for a period 1998 to 2000 all have a peak at 0.4 [ 1/min ] . from the results it is",
    "conclude that a periodical action of dealers exists .    in order to explain this phenomena",
    "a simple dealer model based on the double - threshold noisy devices is proposed . under a hypothesis that the mechanism of this periodicity is stochastic resonance the market activity in the model shows periodicity due to uncertainty of dealers decision even though the exogenous periodical information is weaker than the threshold for dealers to decide their action . in fact this model is a feedforward one",
    ", however , real markets contains complicated ( positive and negative ) feedbacks .",
    "the future work is to consider the feedbacks to improve the dealer model .",
    "moreover the source of this periodicity is open problem .",
    "one possibility is an endogenous feedback mechanism of dealers as shown in mt .",
    "the other is an exogenous periodical information as shown in this paper .",
    "more detailed data analyses let us clarify the mechanism of this phenomena . to consider",
