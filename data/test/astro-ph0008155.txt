    "dynamical studies of the two largest members of the local group  the milky way and the andromeda ( m31 ) galaxies  are of particular interest . the mass of m31 is well constrained on the scales of a few tens of kiloparsecs from the optical and hi rotation curves ( braun 1991 ) and from the kinematics of the planetary nebulae and globular cluster populations ( e.g. , evans & wilkinson 2000 ) . to probe much larger radii and",
    "estimate the total mass of the m31 halo , it is to the satellite galaxy population that we must turn . here",
    ", there have been dramatic developments in the last few years .",
    "the advent of wide - field imaging surveys ( armandroff , davies , & jacoby 1998 ; karachentsev & karachentseva 1999 ; armandroff , jacoby , & davies 1999 ) has led to the discovery of three new dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs )  andv , andvi ( pegdsph ) and casdsph . in all , the entourage of galaxies accompanying m31 now numbers as many as fifteen , although the status of two of these ( pegasus and ic  1613 ) is perhaps unclear as opinions differ as to whether they are close enough to be bound ( mateo 1998 ; grebel 1999 ; courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) .    for the milky way , the data set of the eleven companion galaxies , as well as the distant globular clusters ,",
    "has often been exploited to estimate the total mass of the milky way halo .",
    "the older techniques of virial estimators have nowadays been superseded by more sophisticated bayesian likelihood estimators ( little & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the most recent analysis by wilkinson & evans ( 1999 ) found a total mass for the milky way halo of @xmath3 , with the large error bars reflecting the small sample size and the uncertainties in the proper motions .",
    "hitherto , the satellites of m31 have received scant attention .",
    "evans & wilkinson ( 2000 ) looked at all the available published data on ten of the satellite galaxies and found a rather low mass of @xmath4 .",
    "this raises the possibility that the milky way galaxy may be the largest member of the local group .    here",
    ", we exploit recent stellar velocity measurements with the spectrographs on the _ keck telescopes_. the new observations are reported in detail by guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) .",
    "the results enhance the dataset on the radial velocities of the companion galaxies of m31 by fifty per cent and are used to provide the most reliable estimate of the mass of the extended halo of m31 to date .",
    "the radial velocities of eight of the companions to m31 have been known for some time based on one or more of the following techniques : hi 21 cm measurements , optical absorption line spectra of the integrated light of galaxy cores / nuclei , bulges , or globular clusters , or optical emission line spectra of hii regions .",
    "the data are recorded in the upper panel of table  [ tab : satdata ] .",
    "these techniques are not easily applicable to galaxies of low surface brightness and/or low gas content .",
    "consequently , until very recently , the radial velocities of the six dsph companions ( andi , andii , andiii , andv , andvi , cas dsph ) remained unmeasured .",
    "they require 810 meter class telescopes and efficient spectrographs for spectroscopy of individual red giant stars .",
    "ct et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently provided the first kinematic study of andii .",
    "they used the _ high - resolution echelle spectrometer _ ( hires ; vogt et  al .",
    "1994 ) on the 10-meter _ keck  i telescope _ to measure the radial velocities of a few red giants in each dwarf galaxy .",
    "guhathakurta et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) provide the data on the outstanding five dsphs . using the _ low - resolution imaging spectrometer _ ( lris ; oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) on the _ keck  ii telescope _",
    ", they obtained velocity measurements for nearly a hundred red giants in andi , andiii , andv , and andvi .",
    "guhathakurta et  al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) have also carried out hires multislit echelle observations of 21  red giant branch stars in casdsph .",
    "the radial velocities of the dsphs are recorded in the lower panel of table  [ tab : satdata ] .      in general ,",
    "distance estimates for the m31 companions are derived from variable stars such as cepheids and rr lyrae , from the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method ( lee , freedman , & madore 1993 ) , or from the brightness of horizontal branch ( hb ) stars ( lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ) .",
    "one has to rely on trgb- or hb - based distances for the dsphs , since they lack the young stellar populations with which cepheid variables are associated .",
    "deep @xmath5 and @xmath6 exposures with _ hubble space telescope_/wfpc2 have been used to clearly detect the hb in andi and andii ( da  costa et  al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) .",
    "the distance estimates for these galaxies are the most accurate of all the m31 dsphs .",
    "the hb method provides greater distance accuracy than the trgb method , but hb stars are faint and difficult to photometer accurately , especially in crowded fields , and this makes the method impractical for most ground - based telescopes .",
    "moreover , the metallicity dependence of the hb absolute magnitude , @xmath7 , has been the subject of some debate ( cf .",
    "ajhar et  al .",
    "distances based on the trgb method are available for the rest of the m31 dsph satellites .",
    "photometry of bright red giants has been carried out with the kpno 4-meter telescope , 3.5-meter wiyn telescope , 6-meter bta telescope at the special astrophysical observatory , and with lris on _ keck  ii _ for the following dsphs : andiii ( armandroff et  al .  1993 ) , andv ( armandroff , davies , & jacoby 1998 ; grebel & guhathakurta 1998 ) , andvi ( grebel & guhathakurta 1999 ; tikhonov & karachentsev 1999 ; armandroff , davies , & jacoby 1999 ) , and casdsph ( grebel & guhathakurta 1999 ; tikhonov & karachentsev 1999 ) .",
    "there are several limitations to the trgb method : it takes a large sample size to define the trgb break accurately ; since the method involves the location of a step in the stellar luminosity function , biases in the distance estimate are caused by blends and photometric errors ; errors in statistical field subtraction can be a problem ; super trgb populations such as intermediate - age agb stars can cause systematic errors .",
    "for all the dsphs , there is substantial error on the distances ( see table  [ tab : satdata ] ) .",
    "additional uncertainty is introduced through the poorly known distance of m31 itself , for which a variety of estimates is available using different methods ; we adopt a distance of 770 kpc .",
    "let us assume that the halo of m31 is spherically symmetric with the potential @xmath8 and density @xmath9 given by @xmath10 the satellite galaxies are assumed to follow the same density law @xmath11 but with the scalelength @xmath12 ( cf . , evans & wilkinson 2000 ) .",
    "the velocity normalisation @xmath13 is chosen to reproduce the circular speed at @xmath14 of @xmath15 ( braun 1991 ) .",
    "we adopt two possibilities for the distribution of velocities .",
    "these must depend on the integrals of motion , namely the binding energy @xmath16 and angular momentum @xmath17 per unit mass .",
    "the first is a distribution function of form @xmath18 so that the orbital anisotropy @xmath19 is constant .",
    "this distribution ranges from radial anisotropy ( @xmath20 ) to tangential anisotropy ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the second is a distribution of osipkov - merritt form ( see binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an anisotropy radius .",
    "this distribution is isotropic in the inner parts ( @xmath24 ) and radially anisotropic in the outer parts ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are written out elsewhere ( wilkinson & evans 1999 ; evans & wilkinson 2000 ) .",
    "mass estimation using bayesian likelihood methods was introduced by little & tremaine ( 1987 ) .",
    "bayes theorem states that the probability of any set of model parameters given the data @xmath28 is @xmath29 here , @xmath30 describes our prior beliefs as to the likelihood of the model parameters , while @xmath31 is the probability of the data given the model .",
    "for the 15 satellite galaxies , the data consist of three - dimensional positions @xmath32 with respect to the center of andromeda , together with their heliocentric line of sight velocities @xmath33 .",
    "these are corrected for the motion of the sun around the galactic center and the infall of the milky way towards andromeda .",
    "we assume a circular speed of @xmath34 at the galactocentric radius of the sun ( @xmath35 = 8.0 kpc ) and a solar peculiar velocity in @xmath36 of ( @xmath37 ) = ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the line of sight velocity of m31 , corrected for the motion of the sun , is @xmath39 ( courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "this gives the velocities @xmath40 in the rest frame of the center of m31 .",
    "along any line of sight , let ( @xmath41 ) be polar coordinates in the plane of the sky . then the required probability is given by @xmath42 the prior probabilities contain the _ a priori _ information about the model parameters .",
    "for the total mass @xmath43 , we use @xmath44 , while for the velocity anisotropy , we use @xmath45 or @xmath46 ( see wilkinson & evans ( 1999 ) for a discussion ) .",
    "the distances to the satellite galaxies are the main uncertainty .",
    "our error convolution aims to take account of two factors .",
    "first , there is the quoted error estimate @xmath47 associated with each distance given in table  [ tab : satdata ] .",
    "second , there is a small , but distinct , probability @xmath48 that some of the published distance estimates are seriously in error due to systematic uncertainties ; we assume that the probability of a rogue distance @xmath48 is @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , we choose our convolution function @xmath50 to have the form @xmath51 here , @xmath6 is the hat - box function @xmath52 while @xmath53 is the published distance estimate of the @xmath54th satellite with error @xmath47 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the maximum and minimum of the distance estimates listed in table  [ tab : satdata ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : figl2b ] shows the results for the constant anisotropy distributions .",
    "the most likely mass is @xmath57 and the most likely value of @xmath58 is @xmath590.95 corresponding to tangential anisotropy .",
    "an earlier analysis found that there is a tendency to underestimate the mass for small datasets ( evans & wilkinson 2000 ) .",
    "this typically leads to an underestimate of the order of a factor of two for a dataset of ten to twenty objects , and is combined with a spread that is of the order of fifty per cent .",
    "this gives a final result of @xmath60 .",
    "the anisotropy is poorly constrained as the likelihood contours are distended horizontally .",
    "however , radial anisotropy is not favored as the @xmath61 contour is concentrated in the tangentially anisotropic portion of the figure .",
    "figure  [ fig : figom ] shows the results for the osipkov - merritt distribution function .",
    "the most likely mass is @xmath62 and the most likely value of @xmath23 is @xmath63 , suggesting the velocity distribution is roughly isotropic . table  [ tab : othercases ] shows the effects of varying some of our modelling assumptions on the results for the mass .",
    "these include ( i ) the omission of pegasus and ic 1613 , which may not be bound to m31 ( courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) , ( ii ) the alteration of the satellite distances to those compiled by mateo ( 1998 ) , ( iii ) the increase of the error bars on the distances to @xmath64 , ( iv ) the alteration of the scalelength of the satellite galaxy number density distribution and ( v ) the change of the velocity normalisation of the halo @xmath13 .",
    "the main change is the removal of pegasus and ic 1613 from the dataset , which cause a roughly 30% drop in the mass estimate .",
    "as can be seen from table  [ tab : othercases ] , the other alterations do not have a significant effect on the answer .",
    "we have presented the first detailed study of the mass of the halo of the andromeda galaxy that uses the radial velocity and distance measurements for all six dsph satellites ( andi , andii , andiii , andv , andvi and casdsph ) .",
    "this takes to fifteen the number of tracers at large radii and provides a reasonable sample with which to estimate the total mass .",
    "such calculations have not been possible before , because of the unavailability of radial velocity data for the low surface brightness companions of andromeda .",
    "spectroscopy of individual red giant stars in these systems has only recently become feasible thanks to 810 meter class telescopes such as _ keck _ and state - of - the - art spectrographs ( ct et  al .",
    "1999 ; guhathakurta et  al .",
    "2000a , b ) .",
    "we reckon that the mass of the andromeda halo is @xmath65 .",
    "this comes from analysing all the companion galaxies with a family of velocity distributions of constant orbital anisotropy .",
    "the error bars include the statistical effects of the small dataset , as well as the uncertainties in the distance estimators .",
    "there is some additional uncertainty from changes in the modelling assumptions but this is at the 30% level at most .",
    "for example , altering the velocity distribution gives us a slightly higher estimate of @xmath66 .",
    "the most recent estimate of the mass of the milky way is @xmath67 ( wilkinson & evans 1999 ) .",
    "all the mass estimates inevitably come with substantial uncertainty , as they are inferred from the small datasets of satellite galaxies that are the only known probes of the distant halo .",
    "bearing in mind such caveats , a fair conclusion is that _ the andromeda halo is very roughly as massive as that of the milky way_. there seems little evidence from the satellite galaxy motions for the widely held belief that the andromeda halo is more massive than that of the milky way ( e.g. , peebles 1996 ) . indeed , such evidence as there is points in the opposite direction , namely that the andromeda halo may actually be slightly less massive .",
