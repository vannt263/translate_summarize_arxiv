    "since the establishment of the theory of general relativity by a. einstein , the study of classical gravity has been greatly extended .",
    "it provides some fascinating research subjects , especially cosmology and black holes .",
    "these two topics are powerful motivations for studying physics in curved spacetime .",
    "the quantum effects of matter fields in curved spacetime is also important for studying cosmology and black hole physics . in standard modern cosmology ,",
    "our universe began with an accelerated expansion , known as inflation .",
    "the quantum effect of matter fields in the inflationary universe is believed to give rise to cosmological structures such as galaxies . however , this is merely theoretical scenario lacking any experimental evidence .",
    "another example relates to the very mysterious objects known as black holes . according to s. w. hawking s prediction  @xcite ,",
    "black holes are not completely black but rather they emit black body radiation through particle creation in the curved spacetime .",
    "it is very difficult to confirm this surprising phenomenon experimentally due to the extreme low intensity of the emitted radiation .    with such a background , new attempts to discover",
    "analogous phenomena in fluid systems have appeared . in a pioneering study , unruh found that hawking radiation is not restricted to gravity fields but that it can also be observed in a perfect fluid with a sonic horizon  @xcite .",
    "the basic concept involves identifying a sound wave propagating in a flowing fluid with a scalar field in curved spacetime . in this identification",
    ", fluid flow corresponds to curved spacetime and provides the spacetime metric .",
    "the sound wave can then be considered as a field in curved spacetime .",
    "this analogy has been applied not only to hawking radiation but also to other field theoretical phenomena in curved spacetime , including cosmological particle creation  @xcite .",
    "one of the merits of considering such an analogy lies in possibility of observing quantum effects in a laboratory . for the purpose of performing a precise investigation of quantum effects",
    ", we should consider quantum fluids .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in trapped cold atoms represent one of the best systems in this context  @xcite , for the following three reasons : ( i ) a bec system is quite dilute and weakly interacting , so that its microscopic theory can be easily studied , ( ii ) many physical parameters of becs are experimentally controllable , and ( iii ) various quantum phenomena of becs can be directly observed , in stark contrast with other quantum fluids , such as superfluid helium systems",
    ". therefore , becs are one of the most promising quantum fluids for an analogous system .    in this spacetime analogy",
    ", spacetime corresponds to the condensate wave function described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , quanta of the scalar field in spacetime correspond to bogoliubov quasiparticles , which are low energy excitations on condensates and can be described by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "bogoliubov quasiparticles not only exist in becs at finite temperatures but they are also spontaneously created through the motion of becs , which is one of the important problems associated with defining a bec and its superfluidity in nonequilibrium bose systems .",
    "one of the main subjects of the analogy in bec is to verify the hawking radiation  @xcite .",
    "not only the hawking effect , other aspects of black hole physics as quasinormal frequencies or superradiance were also investigated  @xcite .",
    "another stream is on cosmological models representing homogeneous expanding universe  @xcite or inflationary universe  @xcite .",
    "the analogy in bec was firstly formulated by garay _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and explored by barcel _",
    "_  @xcite . in their formulation",
    ", the analogue geometry is read from a second - order differential equation for the perturbed phase of the condensate wave function which obeys the gp equation . in order to connect quantum physics in curved spacetime to the behavior of a realistic quantum fluid , leonhardt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the hawking effect within the bogoliubov theory of the elementary excitations in bec .",

    ", we formulate the spacetime analogy in terms of the bdg equations as an extension of @xcite , by exactly relating bogoliubov quasiparticles with quantum particles in curved spacetime .",
    "it is shown that the number operator of quanta in analogue spacetime is different from that of bogoliubov quasiparticles , unless the corresponding field is normalized correctly .",
    "with the correct normalization , the number of quanta in analogue spacetime can be exactly related with that of bogoliubov quasiparticles .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the orthonormal relation between the normalized mode functions exactly corresponds to that of bdg wave functions .",
    "we also explicitly define bogoliubov quasiparticle creation as a phenomenon caused by a change in the complete set of bdg wave functions for the motion of a bec , and we define analogue particle creation in terms of bogoliubov quasiparticle creation .",
    "our formulation based on the bdg equations is generally applicable and gives a simple formula for particle creation spectrum in terms of the bogoliubov mode functions . in the derivation of the formula",
    ", we consider the correctly normalized field so that the formula is relevant quantitatively .",
    "our derivation of the formula is different from that given in  @xcite , and consequently the formula is generalized to be applicable in general cases .",
    "furthermore , our formulation is independent of whether condensates are homogeneous or inhomogeneous , and the obtained formula is valid even for inhomogeneous condensates .",
    "we then perform a numerical simulation for the simplest quantum effect in analogue curved spacetime : particle creation by the analogue expanding universe as an expanding bec .",
    "the spectrum obtained is consistent with the thermal maxwell - boltzmann distribution , the temperature of which has already been achieved in actual experiments . in this simulation , we set the initial state for the excitation field to be vacuum just after the condensate starts to expand , and there is no external manipulation after the initial time and the particle creation occurs spontaneously , which should be contrasted to the previous works  @xcite . in this sense ,",

    "we find the stationary solution of the gp equation at the trapping frequency @xmath143 , and then change the frequency to @xmath144 at @xmath145 to make the expanding and shrinking bec .",
    "this situation can be interpreted as a cosmological expansion and contraction , because , in the expansion of condensate for example , the sound velocity becomes small and the time interval @xmath146 during which a particle on the condensate can travel over it , @xmath147 becomes long , where @xmath148 is the thomas - fermi edge of the condensate .",
    "this implies that the size of the analogue spacetime measured by the sound velocity also expands .",
    "furthermore , the sound velocity is not constant with respect to the spatial coordinate , which implies that the analogue spacetime is inhomogeneous",
    ". therefore , the analogue spacetime corresponds to an inhomogeneous expanding universe .",
    "similarly , a shrinking bec corresponds to an inhomogeneous contracting universe .",
    "although the condensate starts to move due to changing the trapping frequency , we are not interested in particle creation caused by such an external manipulation but in spontaneous one as a quantum field theoretical phenomenon . for that purpose , we set vacuum for bogoliubov quasiparticles at time just after changing the frequency , say @xmath149 .",
    "this is the initial condition in this simulation .",
