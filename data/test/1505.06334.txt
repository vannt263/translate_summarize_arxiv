    "after its discovery , the 125-gev higgs boson has been studied and found to be consistent with the standard model ( sm ) expectation as we know at present .",
    "this observation suggests that any new physics degrees of freedom that directly couple with the sm - like higgs boson should reside at a sufficiently high mass scale or be very weakly coupled with the sm particles so that they do not affect its properties significantly . to study higgs physics in this case , as in the case of fermi theory",
    ", it is useful and satisfactory to work with an effective field theory ( eft ) with higher dimensional operators of the sm fields organised in inverse powers of the new physics scale @xmath1 . using the eft approach",
    ", we can learn about possible types of new interactions at low energies . by accumulating sufficient clues , a complete model of the new physics",
    "may be constructed .    as a start",
    ", we assume that new physics does not violate known gauge and lorentz symmetries in the sm so that the higher dimensional operators obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom also satisfy the same symmetries .",
    "there is only one dimension-5 operator ( for one family of fermions ) consistent with this , _",
    "i.e. _ , the weinberg operator that gives rise to majorana mass for neutrinos  @xcite",
    ". this operator violates the lepton number by two units . in the case of dimension-6 operators , the original attempt to compile a complete basis  @xcite",
    "was later found to be redundant  @xcite , leaving 64 independent operators ( also for one family of fermions )  @xcite with five of them violating either baryon or lepton number  @xcite . for weakly interacting renormalizable gauge theories that are perturbatively decoupling",
    ", the dimension-6 operators can be classified into potentially tree - generated and loop - generated ones  @xcite .",
    "note that it has been stressed with explicit examples that the classification of higher dimensional operators into tree and loop ones within the eft can be ambiguous  @xcite .",
    "a good discussion and comparison of different operator bases of popular choices  @xcite can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are some attractive motivations to consider models with an extended scalar sector .",
    "for example , new scalar bosons in these models may facilitate a strong first - order phase transition for successful electroweak baryogenesis , provide majorana mass for neutrinos , and/or have a connection with a hidden sector that houses dark matter candidates .",
    "even though it may not be possible to directly probe this sector due to the heavy masses of new scalar bosons and/or their feeble interactions with sm particles , they can nevertheless leave imprints in some electroweak precision observables .    in this paper",
    ", we analyse the eft of the sm - like higgs boson for a wide class of weakly coupled renormalisable new physics models extended by one type of scalar field(s )  -a and [ sec : ex]-c . ] and respecting cp symmetry .",
    "it can be shown that only a few types of interactions contribute to the higgs dimension-6 operators .",
    "two of them are @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a dimensionful quantity , @xmath5 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath6 is a singlet field , @xmath7 form a triplet field , and @xmath8 are the su(2 ) generators .",
    "these interactions only arise for specific representations of the new scalar and lead to dimension-6 operators when matching onto the eft at tree level .",
    "another two are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the su(2 ) operators appropriate for the new scalar field @xmath12 .",
    "these interactions are more generic and , after the heavy scalar fields are integrated out , give rise to dimension-6 operators at one - loop level .",
    "we work out the effective operators and the associated wilson coefficients for an arbitrary new scalar field @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote its multiplicities under @xmath16 and @xmath0 , respectively , and @xmath17 is its hypercharge .",
    "phenomenological results of a few benchmark models are studied in this framework .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : eff ] , we define our framework of uv - complete models whose scalar sector is augmented from the sm by one new scalar field , and list dimension-6 operators composed of the sm higgs and electroweak gauge fields that are of interest to us . for the new scalar field of a generic representation , the dimension-6 operators are induced only from one - loop matching due to two specific types of quartic interactions in the uv theory .",
    "we also identify accidental interaction terms for specific representations of the new scalar field that can lead to the dimension-6 operators already from tree - level matching .",
    "we first concentrate on the accidental interactions in section  [ sec : tree ] , and work out the wilson coefficients of induced operators from tree - level matching for these specific scalar representations .",
    "these wilson coefficients are further improved by renormalisation group running .",
    "section  [ sec : loop ] discusses the matching of the full theory onto the effective theory at one - loop level for the new scalar of a general representation in the sm gauge group . in section  [ sec : ex ] , we work out the results for a few benchmark models commonly considered in the literature . using the results , we show numerically how the model parameters are constrained by current and future electroweak precision observables and sm higgs data .",
    "section  [ sec : sum ] summarises our findings .",
    "in the following , we will consider the renormalizable model having a scalar sector extended with a generic scalar field that couples to the sm higgs field , and match it at tree and one - loop levels onto an effective theory with operators up to dimension-6 .",
    "moreover , we will use the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) to evolve the wilson coefficients obtained from the tree - level matching from the new physics scale down to the electroweak scale , thereby capturing the leading - log loop corrections to them , and combine with those from the direct one - loop matching . throughout this paper , we will use @xmath5 and @xmath12 to denote the sm higgs field and the generic new scalar field , respectively .",
    ".independent cp - even dimension-6 operators composed of only the higgs and electroweak boson fields that are relevant to the analysis in this work .",

    "we have pointed out that there are only two generic quartic interactions that will lead to dimension-6 operators only at one - loop level .",
    "we work out the wilson coefficients associated with these operators for the general case in terms of the new physics parameters .    using the existing lep oblique parameter measurements and lhc higgs data , we study the current constraints on the parameters of several benchmark models . the same is also done for the projected results expected in the future experiment . although indirect , comparing the higher dimensional operators in the effective field theory with precision measurements is always a useful probe and complementary to the direct search method .",
