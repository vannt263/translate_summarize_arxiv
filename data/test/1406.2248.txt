    "in the field of optomechanics , one is always designing mechanical systems with lowest possible friction  @xcite and highest possible optomechanical coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "this is because one would like to produce and use coherent phonons with long coherence time .",
    "one prominent application of coherent phonons is in storage and retrieval of light using optomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "an attractive system which has received considerable attention is the levitated microsphere trapped in an optical cavity .",
    "both trapping and levitation can be produced by optical fields  @xcite .",

    "v. when the electromagnetic cavity is designed in such a way that allowed optical modes are such that no anti - stokes upconversion is possible via the absorption of any single phonon in the medium , one must consider absorption of two phonons for possible upconversion .",
    "such a process can be controlled well when these phonons are external phonons injected in the medium .",

    "<S> a general theory is presented to describe optomechanical interactions of acoustic phonons , having extremely long lifetimes in superfluid @xmath0he , with optical photons in the medium placed in a suitable electromagnetic cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the acoustic nonlinearity in the fluid motion is included to consider processes beyond the usual linear process involving absorption or emission of one phonon at a time . </S>",
    "<S> we first apply our formulation to the simplest one - phonon process involving the usual resonant anti - stokes upconversion of an incident optical mode . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the allowed optical cavity modes are such that there is no single - phonon mode in the superfluid which can give rise to a resonant allowed anti - stokes mode , we must consider the possibility of two - phonon upconversion . </S>",
    "<S> for such a case , we show that the two - step two - phonon process could be dominant . </S>",
    "<S> we present arguments for large two - step process and negligible single step two - phonon contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the two - step process also shows interesting quantum interference among different transition pathways . </S>"
