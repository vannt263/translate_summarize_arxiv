    "animal packing in social aggregations is of fundamental interest in ecology , and their conformations have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "pioneer tank observations of pelagic fishes ( herring , sprat and mackerel ) were conducted by @xcite , and the `` persistently uniform density '' of a school was noted . from experiments on schools of saithe _ pollachius virens _ , herring _ clupea harengus _ and cod _ gadus morhua _ cruising in a ten meters circular gantry tank , @xcite validated that all the fish in a school occupy a volume proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of fish and @xmath4 is the mean nearest - neighbor distance ( approximate to the mean fish - body length ) in the school .",
    "@xcite reported from field observations that the number densities of herring schools are almost independent of the dimensional size of school but are an order of magnitude lower than the packing densities observed when schooling in small tanks .",
    "tauti and colleagues @xcite had experimentally shown that a fish school can be viewed as a group of inorganic particles and treated with the methods of physics .",
    "@xcite explicitly applied physical equations to such fish schools . recently",
    ", a number of theoretical and numerical models of schooling and flocking behavior have been studied by biologists , mathematicians and physicists @xcite . as for the animal group geometry , many models for social aggregations , however , predict that densities increase as the group size ( in number ) increases [ overviews of such models are given in refs .",
    "@xcite mathematically tackled this problem of constant density and revealed the condition for a well - spaced group , i.e. what class of mutual interactions results in a relatively constant individual distance in the interior of the aggregate .",
    "more recently , by means of underwater acoustics , the school sizes ( in number or biomass of fish ) have been quantitatively measured for different values of the dimensional size of schools in the wild .",
    "precise data on conformations of large - sized schools of pelegic fishes became available rapidly , which were extremely helpful in elucidating a certain geometric law , i.e. the relation between dimensional and biomass sizes of pelagic fish schools , bringing about some important changes in our viewpoints .",
    "misund and colleagues @xcite found that the power - law scaling in dimension - to - biomass relationship exists , and is robust across a broad range of pelagic species as well as across diverse environments .",
    "they demonstrated that if the biomass @xmath3 in a school is , say , doubled , the cross - sectional area of a school is increased by a factor @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 and that the exponent @xmath7 looks universal , reading @xmath8 ( from the field data @xmath7 ranges from @xmath9 to @xmath10 ) .",
    "the geometric law they found implies that the mean density of a school scales as @xmath11 in three dimensions of space and the conformation of social aggregations swells ( i.e. @xmath12 ) .",
    "such a relationship as eq.([eqn : misund - school - geometry ] ) with @xmath13 has been utilized for the dimensions to biomass conversion ( e.g. transforming the school diameter @xmath14 to the number @xmath3 of fish ) in analyzing school - size distributions @xcite .",
    "it might come as a surprise that packing densities decrease as the group size increases , contrary to previous observations and predictions .",
    "laboratory observations for school geometry and internal structure have been made exclusively in small tanks , which generally show the constant density of fish that the school volume is proportional to the number of individuals . in all set - ups , the factors resulting in homogeneous ,",
    "cohesive school may be especially pronounced , and it therefore seems that the quantified structure is skewed .",
    "@xcite claimed that homogeneity in schools has been over - emphasized . _ in - situ _ observations of herring and sprat schools with a high resolution sonar revealed that the packing structure within the schools is rather heterogeneous @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by measurements of free - swimming schools using photography and high - resolution echo integration , which showed that the packing density distribution in capelin _ mallotus villosus _ and clupeoid schools varies considerably @xcite .",
    "regions of high density are usually found within the schools , and even empty vacuoles have been recorded .",
    "@xcite observed by repeated echo integration that there were large variations in internal packing density of herring schools ( i.e. high - density regions or empty lacunas within a school ) , and that the packing density structure was quasi - stationary . besides artificial environments in small tanks , the discrepancy in former observations could have been caused by too small numbers of fish in the schools .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , @xmath3 takes a few tens of fish .",
    "since such a geometric law above is always defined only in a certain limit @xcite , the scaling in the dimension - to - biomass relationship is expected to hold for large - sized schools of pelagics .    in this paper , the exponent @xmath7",
    "is estimated according to the established universal scaling law in the school - size distribution of pelagic fishes @xcite : choose the suitable value of @xmath7 to achieve the best data - collapse on the size distributions in terms of the school dimension .",
    "notice that the dimension - to - biomass relationship is a property of the single school and the scaling exponent @xmath7 is determined by the behavioral algorithm of fish schooling at individual level , while the scaling in the school - size distribution emerges from the inter - school interactions at population level ( i.e. a global property of the interacting school system ) .",
    "animal group size is a focal issue in ecology that , in contrast to scaling , has introduced a single preferred size ( i.e. optimal or compromise size ) for any organism living in groups @xcite .",

    ". their linear dimension , e.g. the vertical thickness , of the school falls into a certain range below a few tens of meters . one fish may not be the right atomic unit in schooling , since field observations suggest that no school exists under a certain minimal size .",
    "this may cause binned data of school sizes to exhibit the fake peak frequency . @xcite and @xcite have ignored slowly decaying ( or fat - tailed ) distributions , including scaling laws , in such data of school sizes short ranged with a fake peak frequency ( the possibility of power laws was already presented in their models but not exploited ) . a traditional , widely used gauss statistics says that , for the data from @xcite shown in fig.[fig:1 ] , finding sardine schools ranging from 18 to 20 meters in vertical thickness should only occur about once every @xmath15 detections of schools [ for detail , consult @xcite ] .",
    "in other words , it is not the real world !",

    "fat - tailed distributions have been found to quite generally characterize the size heterogeneity of pelagic fish schools @xcite .",
    "only lately , @xcite showed that the school - size distribution of pelagic fishes has the universal functional form of a power - law decay and a crossover towards the exponential distribution .",
    "scaling laws have been found to characterize many patterns in ecological systems @xcite .",
    "there is an empirical rule about the relationship between the areas ( @xmath17 ) of island and the numbers ( @xmath18 ) of species on them : whether counting birds , butterflies , plants or copepods in ponds , a tenfold smaller area contains roughly half the species .",
    "this can be fitted by a power - law function @xmath19 with the exponent @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the species - area relationship is widely used in rough assessments of likely future rates of species extinction ( because observed rates of tropical deforestation are equated to loss of habitat area , we can assess the annual production of species committed to extinction ) .",
    "so , a more secure understanding of such relationships has great practical importance @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied finite - size scaling @xcite to test the hypothesis of scaling invariance in the species - area relationship resting on a model proposed by @xcite for the species abundance distribution .",
    "following the conventional notation in the physics literature , the system sizes are hereafter denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "the finite - size scaling ( fss ) hypothesis assumes that the fraction of objects with size @xmath21 for a finite system of size @xmath17 is written , with a scaling exponent @xmath22 , as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a universal scaling function .",
    "@xmath25 reads , for instance , the species - abundance distribution , which defines the probability that any given species on a census patch of area @xmath17 has @xmath21 individuals , where @xmath26 is the expected number of species with @xmath21 individuals .",

    "we test the fss hypothesis by data collapsing : when @xmath29 is plotted versus @xmath30 , if the distributions across different @xmath17 s fall on a single curve ( e.g. collapsing distinct abundance distributions measured in different areas and with different total numbers of individuals onto one scaling curve ) , then we should be able to identify a scaling function @xmath31 . in order to determine the exponent @xmath22",
    ", we try a best - fitting procedure such that the family of curves @xmath25 collapses onto a single curve as well as possible .",
    "we then obtain other scaling exponents ( e.g. @xmath32 of the species - area relationship ) resting on the scaling relation between scaling exponents @xcite . by noting that the total number of individuals of all species is equal to @xmath33 , the species - area relationship leads to a scaling relation @xmath34 assuming that the total number of individuals of all species is proportional to area @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the universal scaling is fundamental to data collapse .",

    ", the presence of non - trivial scaling is usually taken to mean that the dynamics are largely governed by simple geometric properties of the system and do not depend strongly on detailed properties of the system components @xcite .",
    "as for the school geometry , the basic units are the effective inter - fish length @xmath4 and the number of fish , @xmath3 .",
    "we assemble @xmath193 neighboring fish in a school into @xmath194 groups , e.g. in the sense of the voronoi - dirichlet diagram @xcite .",
    "the length between centers of neighboring subgroups is defined by @xmath195 with an exponent @xmath196 .",
    "after such a scale change as @xmath197 the macroscopic quantities which determine the overall properties of the school satisfy @xmath198 where @xmath199 is an exponent which depends on the quantity under consideration .",
    "for this to hold true for arbitrary @xmath193 , the function @xmath200 must take the scaling form @xmath201 where a new function @xmath202 is introduced .",
    "this is the widom - kadanoff scaling law in critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "for example , the average radius of the school , @xmath14 , should be unaltered under the transformation of eq.([eqn : scale - change ] ) : @xmath203 because of eq.([eqn : scaling - school - geometry ] ) , @xmath204 and we must have @xmath205 where @xmath206 in three dimensions .    as an example of the application of the above scaling law ,",
    "let us consider the pair correlation function inside a school , where fish movement take place in a three - dimensional space .",
    "a pair correlation function @xmath207 is defined as follows .",
    "we pick one fish at random in the school , and we place it at origin",
    ". then we ask , what is the number density of other fish at a ( directional ) distance @xmath137 from the first , and we average the result over all choices of the first fish ( and of directions ) .",
    "the function @xmath207 has an integral which is just the total number of fish per school , @xmath208 .",
    "hence , from dimensional analysis , we can write @xmath209 under the transformation that neighboring @xmath193 fish are grouped to form one subunit in a school , @xmath207 will be reduced by @xmath210 , since the pair correlation function is proportional to the number density of fish .",
    "therefore @xmath211 then , the function @xmath207 obeys a simple scaling rule @xmath212 where @xmath213 is a dimensionless universal function , and @xmath214 is the dimensional factor . focusing on the limit @xmath215 , we can reach the form of @xmath207 by a simple argument . in a sphere of radius @xmath134",
    "we have a certain number of fish , @xmath216 , related to @xmath134 by the excluded volume exponent : @xmath217 . the function @xmath207 scales like the density of fish in the sphere , @xmath218 which gives @xmath219 .",
    "the possible observable property , eq.([eqn : pair - correlation - scaling ] ) , tells us that if we were to measure @xmath207 for fish schools of different size @xmath3 , there would be superposition of the curves obtained by plotting @xmath220 against @xmath221 .",
    "thus this kind of scaling relation may be verified experimentally on large schools of pelagic fish .",
    "the power - law scaling generally exists in dimension - to - biomass relationship of pelagic fish schools in nature . here",
    "i have estimated the power - law exponent @xmath7 of the geometric relation , based on the dependence of the power - law regime of the school - dimension distribution @xmath51 on @xmath7 , i.e. eq.([eqn : depend - cutoff - nu ] ) .",
    "we have tested whether the distributions @xmath51 are self - similar ( i.e. exhibit scaling ) , relying on both the power law for the dimension - to - biomass relationship of eq.([eqn : scaling - school - geometry ] ) and the fss relation in the power - law school - biomass distribution of eq.([eqn : biomass - distribution ] ) .",
    "plotting the scaled histogram - data from the 22 _ in - situ _ observations , we have found that the 22 curves do indeed collapse onto each other ( fig.[fig:2]a ) , suggesting that @xmath51 follows a universal functional form [ eq.([eqn : dimension - distribution ] ) ] .",
    "we have extracted the power - law exponent of dimension - to - biomass scaling relationship via a minimization of a measure to quantify the nature of scaling collapse .",
    "next i have explained the value of the exponent @xmath7 , proposing the gaussian school model for the fish with excluded volume @xmath140 . by exploiting the analogy between fish - school and polymer conformations",
    ", we have examined the behavioral algorithm governing the swollen conformation of large - sized schools .",
    "we have seen that the exponent is modified strongly by the steric effect . what is universal in eq.([eqn : scaling - school - geometry ] )",
    "is the exponent @xmath222 : it is independent of species as well as environmental conditions , and the same for all schools .",
    "the constant that multiplies @xmath223 in eq.([eqn : scaling - school - geometry ] ) is non - universal [ @xmath224 with effective inter - fish distance @xmath4 , predicted from eq.([eqn : rouse - excluded - volume - effect ] ) ] , and depends on the details of interactions between fish which may vary with species and environmental conditions @xcite .    to understand the scaling law for school geometry , eq.([eqn : scaling - school - geometry ] ) with @xmath88 , it is essential to see what the value of @xmath7 represents .",
    "obviously , for a regular object embedded into a @xmath225-dimensional euclidean space , eq.([eqn : scaling - school - geometry ] ) would have the form @xmath226 expressing the fact that the volume of a @xmath225-dimensional object grows with its linear size @xmath14 as @xmath227 .",
    "contrary to an integer dimensionality , it has been shown that the packing structure within the schools is characterized by a non - integer ( i.e. fractal ) dimensionality of @xmath228 : the number of fish in a school of radius @xmath14 scales as @xmath229 . during the last decades of the twentieth century it has widely been recognized by researchers working in diverse areas of science",
    "that many of the structures commonly observed possess a rather special kind of geometrical complexity ; the name `` fractal '' was coined by benoit mandelbrot for these complex shapes @xcite .",
    "objects of biological origin are many times fractal - like @xcite .",
    "fss plots of data lead to possibly important and practical insights in ecology . in the context of the fisheries mission ,",
    "the demonstrated geometric relation between dimensions and biomass of pelagic fish schools , when applied to mapping pelagic schooling fish , will largely improve the precision in the fish stock assessment .",
    "because of the linear dependence of the fish population on @xmath38 , as given by eq.([eqn : cutoff - population ] ) , the fish stock abundance can be inferred from an index ( i.e. cut - off size ) that can be determined directly from observations [ see eq.([eqn : cut - off - size ] ) ] .",

    "<S> motivated by the finding that there is some biological universality in the relationship between school geometry and school biomass of various pelagic fishes in various conditions , i here establish a scaling law for school dimensions : the school diameter increases as a power - law function of school biomass . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law exponent is extracted through the data collapse , and is close to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this value of the exponent implies that the mean packing density decreases as the school biomass increases , and the packing structure displays a mass - fractal dimension of @xmath1 . by exploiting an analogy between school geometry and polymer chain statistics , </S>",
