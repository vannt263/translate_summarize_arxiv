    "electron scattering is one of the most important processes in determining the emergent thermal spectrum from models of optically thick accretion discs around black holes and neutron stars .",
    "electron scattering opacity generally dominates absorption opacity in the atmospheres of the innermost regions of such discs @xcite . in the case where coherent ( thomson ) scattering is a good approximation ,",
    "the resulting local thermal spectrum of some annulus in the disc is generally harder than a blackbody with the same effective temperature , due to incomplete thermalization at the scattering photosphere .",
    "however , incoherent ( compton ) scattering in the disc surface layers by thermal electrons can reduce this spectral hardening by increasing the energy exchange between the photons and the plasma @xcite .",
    "in addition to the disc atmosphere itself , many models invoke a powerful corona above the disc consisting of high temperature or nonthermal electrons that compton upscatter disc photons to produce the energetically significant hard x - rays that exist in certain classes of active galactic nuclei and in certain black hole x - ray binary accretion states ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these hard x - rays in turn interact with the relatively cool disc atmosphere to produce reflection spectra that are widely observed in many black hole sources ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we explore turbulent comptonization , which is the effect of comptonization by bulk , turbulent electron motions on photon spectra @xcite . in sources with radiation pressure dominated",
    "accretion flows , bulk velocities may exceed thermal electron velocities , a phenomenon first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the turbulent speeds @xmath0 on the outer scale of an mhd turbulent cascade will be of order the alfvn speed , and the ratio of this to the root mean square electron thermal velocity is therefore @xmath1 here @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the gas , radiation , and magnetic pressures , respectively , and @xmath5 is the ratio of the proton to electron mass .",
    "stratified shearing box simulations of magnetorotational turbulence generally have disc atmospheres that are supported by magnetic fields rather than thermal pressure @xcite .",
    "hence the first factor generally exceeds unity in an otherwise radiation pressure dominated disc .",
    "bulk speeds on the outer scale of the turbulence will therefore exceed the electron thermal speeds whenever the radiation pressure to gas pressure ratio exceeds the ratio of the proton to electron mass ratio , and even smaller depending on how magnetically supported is the disc atmosphere . in this regime ,",
    "bulk comptonization by the turbulence may dominate thermal comptonization in determining the shape of the spectrum emitted by a local patch of the disc .",
    "this regime is commonly reached for near eddington accretion on black holes of all mass scales .",
    "indeed , the inner disc solution of the standard geometrically thin model of @xcite gives vertically averaged radiation to gas pressure ratios of approximately @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ratio of turbulent stress to thermal pressure , @xmath8 is the black hole mass , @xmath9 is the radiative efficiency of the disc as a whole , @xmath10 is the luminosity in eddington units , and @xmath11 is the radius in the disc in units of the gravitational radius @xmath12 .",
    "hence the radiation to gas pressure ratio of the innermost disc will generally exceed the proton to electron mass ratio for near - eddington accretion even for stellar mass black holes , and certainly for supermassive black holes . on the other hand , energy exchange between the photons and the plasma",
    "is generally dominated by true absorption opacity in standard disc models for the most supermassive black holes @xcite , which may reduce bulk comptonization by turbulence in these sources .",
    "we are also motivated by observational evidence in many sources for a cooler , more optically thick medium that also compton upscatters disc photons in high luminosity sources , but not to the high energies usually associated with the more traditional external corona . the soft x - ray excess of the type 1 seyfert ngc  5548 was fit by @xcite with a warm ( @xmath13  kev ) optically thick ( @xmath14 ) comptonizing medium .",

    "@xcite fit the soft x - ray excess of the extreme narrow line seyfert 1 re  j0134 + 396 assuming extra comptonization within the disc atmosphere itself with @xmath18  kev and @xmath19 .",
    "such a spectral decomposition is consistent with the lack of short time scale variability in the soft x - ray excess compared to the hard x - rays in this source @xcite .",
    "@xcite fit the soft x - ray excesses of eleven bright quasars with comptonization in a medium with @xmath20  kev and @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite fit soft intermediate state spectra of the black hole x - ray binary gx 339 - 4 with a comptonizing medium with @xmath22  kev and @xmath23 .",
    "thermal comptonization fits to the soft x - ray spectra of a number of ultraluminous x - ray sources have @xmath24  kev and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "such fits have been nicely confirmed with _ nustar _ and _ xmm - newton _ spectra of the ultraluminous x - ray sources ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 , which require warm @xmath26  kev , optically thick @xmath27 comptonizing media @xcite . @xcite and @xcite suggest that one way of forming these optically thick cool coronae is by a radiation pressure driven outflow .",
    "the alternative we consider here is bulk comptonization by turbulence in the disc atmosphere itself .",
    "comptonization by bulk motions in the accretion flow has also been considered by others . @xcite",
    "considered bulk comptonization in converging flows and shocks .",
    "starting from this seminal work , bulk comptonization by radial flows has been calculated in detail by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "@xcite included bulk comptonization in their monte carlo calculations of photon spectra from radiation mhd simulations of super - eddington accretion flows , and found that it produced significant spectral hardening which resembled spectra of ultra - luminous x - ray sources .",
    "here we focus on smaller scale bulk comptonization by turbulence within the disc atmosphere itself .",
    "turbulent comptonization has also been invoked in other areas of astrophysics . @xcite and @xcite used then current limits on cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies to constrain possible turbulent energy on cosmological scales prior to recombination . @xcite considered comptonization by alfvnic turbulence in a relativistic outflow as a model for the spectrum of gamma - ray bursts .    the purpose of this paper is to determine how photon spectra produced by turbulent comptonization depend on properties of the turbulence itself , and how to resolve and interpret this effect in radiation mhd simulations .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec_general ]",
    "we show that the macroscopic physical origins of turbulent comptonization energy exchange are work due to radiation pressure and viscous dissipation due to the radiation viscous stress tensor , and we discuss why this requires us to treat divergenceless turbulence separately from turbulence with non - zero divergence . in section [ sec_energy_exchange ] we discuss the consequences of this for correctly implementing radiative transport in simulations , and derive the appropriate radiation energy equation in both lab and fluid frame variables . in section [ sec_incompressible ]",
    "we address the conjecture of @xcite that turbulent comptonization can be treated as thermal comptonization by solving the kompaneets equation with an equivalent  wave \" temperature critically dependent on the photon mean free path .",
    "we show this is true only for divergenceless turbulence , derive the exact wave temperature with an analytic solution of the radiative transfer equation , and use this result to discuss how the wave temperature depends on the power spectrum of the turbulence . to provide physical insight",
    ", we also perform an intuitive , heuristic calculation of the wave temperature which well approximates the analytic solution . in section [ sec_compressible ]",
    "we consider bulk comptonization by turbulence with non - zero divergence .",
    "we show that comptonization by turbulence whose wavelengths are short relative to the photon mean free path can be treated as thermal comptonization with an equivalent temperature given by the full turbulent power . in the limit of extremely optically thick turbulence , we show how the evolution of local photon spectra can be understood in terms of compression and expansion of the strongly coupled photon and gas fluids . in section [ sec_discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results , and we summarize our findings in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "in order to determine how photon spectra produced by turbulent comptonization depend on properties of the turbulence itself , it is useful to understand the distinct macroscopic physical origins of net energy exchange due to this effect .",
    "we show that these are simply the work done by radiation pressure and radiation viscous dissipation , and discuss the major consequences of this .",
    "we limit our consideration in this paper to non - relativistic velocities .    before proceeding , we define terms and quantities that will be used repeatedly . by bulk comptonization",
    "we mean comptonization by bulk motions in general , and by turbulent comptonization we mean bulk comptonization specifically due to turbulence .",
    "we denote the characteristic photon mean free path @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the electron density and @xmath30 is the thompson cross section . we denote the typical length scale for bulk velocity variations @xmath31 , such as the wavelength if there is a well - defined spatial period . unless otherwise stated , by the terms optically thin and thick we mean @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the minimum and maximum length scales in the turbulent cascade , respectively , not referring to the optical depth that a photon would need to travel to escape the medium .",
    "net energy exchange due to bulk comptonization is simply the net energy exchange between gas mechanical energy and radiation . inside the photosphere ,",
    "the mechanical energy loss rate per unit volume to radiation is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the lab frame radiation pressure tensor .",
    "this can also be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the trace of the radiation pressure tensor , @xmath40 is the radiation viscous shear stress tensor , and @xmath41 is the velocity shear tensor .",
    "we see that the energy exchange is separated into two pieces , one due to only a diverging velocity field and another due to a shearing velocity field in the presence of a radiation viscous shear stress tensor .",
    "the first piece has contributions from two effects , ordinary work done by radiation pressure , and radiation viscous dissipation .",
    "the former effect is first order in velocity since it is due to the contribution to @xmath42 that is zeroth order in velocity .",
    "energy exchange due to viscous effects , on the other hand , is second order in the velocity , as @xmath43 and the relevant contribution to @xmath42 must themselves be at least first order in velocity since they are a consequence of the velocity field .",
    "@xcite conjectured that turbulent comptonization can be treated as thermal comptonization by solving the kompaneets equation with an equivalent  wave \" temperature critically dependent on the photon mean free path .",
    "this is physically intuitive for divergenceless turbulence since in this case energy exchange is entirely due to radiation viscous dissipation and is therefore second order in velocity . in section [ sec_incompressible ]",
    "we prove this conjecture for an arbitrary , divergenceless velocity field of uniform density , derive the exact expression for the wave temperature , and show how it is related to the standard expression for radiation viscosity in the optically thick limit .",
    "the connection between bulk comptonization and the radiation viscous shear stress tensor is useful because it correctly suggests that the wave temperature can be written in terms of @xmath43 .",
    "since pressure work , on the other hand , is an effect first order in velocity , and since comptonization by a velocity field with non - zero divergence is a combination of pressure work and radiation viscous dissipation , it is not surprising that in this case bulk comptonization can not be treated as thermal comptonization , as we show in section [ sec_compressible ] .",
    "but in the optically thin limit , i.e. when the mean free path is significantly larger than the largest length scale in the turbulence , energy exchange that is first order in velocity vanishes since photons are equally likely to downscatter as they are to upscatter .",
    "bulk comptonization by a velocity field with non - zero divergence is then solely due to radiation viscous dissipation , and in section [ sec_compressible ] we show that it may be treated as thermal comptonization by solving the kompaneets equation with a wave temperature equivalent to the full bulk power .    in the optically thick case ,",
    "i.e. when the mean free path is significantly smaller than the smallest scale in the turbulence , the lowest order energy exchange is the work done by radiation pressure to compress the gas , since it is first order in velocity and since radiation viscous effects are suppressed by a factor @xmath44 ( section [ sec_incompressible ] ) . @xcite assumed that effects first order in velocity always vanish on average for turbulent eddies , but in the optically thick limit photons trapped in a converging ( diverging ) region undergo systematic upscattering ( downscattering ) . in the extremely optically thick limit",
    "in which the photon and gas fluids are strongly coupled , velocity convergence corresponds to compression in which gas mechanical energy is transferred locally to the photons . in section [ sec_compressible ]",
    "we show that in this process a locally thermal photon distribution remains thermal and only changes temperature , completely analogous to the evolution of the cosmic microwave background radiation under the expansion of the universe .",
    "unlike energy exchange due to viscous dissipation , this process is reversible .",
    "the effect of this process on the emergent spectrum of the disc will depend primarily on how effectively photons are able to escape from such regions to the observer .",
    "self - consistent radiation mhd simulations of turbulent , radiation pressure dominated accretion flows now exist , both in local vertically stratified shearing box geometries @xcite and in global simulations @xcite .",
    "although these simulations use frequency integrated equations , the emergent radiation spectrum can be computed , including the effects of bulk comptonization , using post - processing monte carlo simulations . indeed , this has already been done by @xcite . however , in order for such calculations to be self - consistent , the frequency integrated radiation mhd equations used in the simulations themselves must include energy exchange due to bulk comptonization .",
    "we now discuss the consequences of the macroscopic physical origins of such energy exchange detailed in section [ sec_general ] for ensuring this effect is captured in simulations .",
    "we then proceed to derive the appropriate frequency integrated source terms due to compton scattering for the gas and radiation energy equations in both lab frame and fluid frame variables . using these results , we discuss the extent to which bulk comptonization is captured by existing radiation mhd simulation codes .",
    "the decomposition of bulk comptonization energy exchange into pressure work and radiation viscous dissipation shows that radiation mhd schemes that neglect contributions to the viscous stress tensor that are first order in velocity can not capture bulk comptonization energy exchange due to a shearing velocity field or any optically thin velocity field with non - zero divergence .",
    "as these effects are second order in velocity , we also note that a necessary , but not sufficient , condition for capturing these effects is inclusion of energy terms second order in velocity . without such terms ,",
    "turbulence in this form , instead of exchanging energy with photons , will eventually cascade down to the gridscale ( or viscous or resistive scale if the code has explicit viscosity or resistivity ) , and increase the internal energy of the gas .",
    "gas internal energy may then be exchanged with photons through thermal comptonization .",
    "the omission of viscous dissipation by radiation therefore does not prevent the eventual transfer of turbulent energy to radiation , but it may have other physical effects that can in turn affect radiation spectra .    to derive the appropriate frequency integrated source terms due to comptonization , we start with the zeroth moment of the radiative transfer equation , correct to order @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite , @xmath47+\\frac{v_i}{c } n^i\\biggr\\}\\cr + \\left({18\\over5}+{17\\over5}\\epsilon{\\partial\\over\\partial\\epsilon } + { 11\\over20}\\epsilon^2{\\partial^2\\over\\partial\\epsilon^2}\\right ) \\left(n^{ij}{v_iv_j\\over c^2}-{v^2\\over3c^2}n\\right ) . \\label{eqpsaltis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 is the photon energy , and the various angle - averaged moments are defined in terms of the energy and direction ( @xmath49 ) dependent photon occupation number @xmath50 by @xmath51 in principle , the energy equation is obtained by writing eq .",
    "( [ eqpsaltis ] ) in terms of moments of the specific intensity and then integrating over all frequencies . unfortunately , we can not integrate over terms multiplied by @xmath52 without prior knowledge of the spectrum .",
    "for the purpose of simulations , then , we make two approximations .",
    "first , we observe that the fractional energy change per scattering off of non - relativistic electrons is small , so that only regions inside the photosphere contribute to comptonization .",
    "since the stimulated scattering terms are already order @xmath52 and in these regions departures from isotropy are order @xmath53 , we make the following approximation for these terms : @xmath54 second , we assume that the spectrum can be approximated by a bose - einstein distribution with temperature @xmath55 . with these approximations , eq .",
    "( [ eqpsaltis ] ) yields @xmath56 this is the correct energy equation , but in order for it to capture second order energy exchange , the substituted value of @xmath57 must be calculated with a moment closure scheme that does not neglect contributions to the radiation viscous stress tensor that are first order in velocity .",
    "for example , it is not adequate to calculate @xmath57 by substituting @xmath58 into the first moment equation . here . ]",
    "this is equivalent to flux limited diffusion in the diffusion regime , such as that implemented in @xcite .",
    "these do , however , capture energy exchange due to pressure work in the optically thick regime . to show this , we substitute into eq .",
    "( [ integrated1 ] ) the standard closure relation , @xmath59 which gives @xmath60 we see that energy exchange second order in velocity is not present .",
    "furthermore , we see that energy exchange due to a converging velocity field is indeed the work done by radiation pressure to compress the gas , @xmath61 .",
    "the m1 closure scheme @xcite , implemented in , e.g. , @xcite , also captures first order energy exchange but not second order energy exchange .",
    "this scheme assumes that there exists a frame in which @xmath62 .",
    "the lab frame radiation pressure tensor can then be expressed in terms of the energy density and flux @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 to show that second order energy exchange is not captured , we consider the case of a non - zero radiation viscous shear stress tensor due to a non - relativistic velocity field in an otherwise homogeneous medium . the lowest order contribution to the flux must be first order in velocity . in this scheme ,",
    "then , the radiation viscous shear stress tensor is zero to first order in velocity , and hence second order energy exchange , which requires a contribution first order in velocity ( eq . [ energy_exchange ] ) , is not captured .",
    "another way to understand why both flux - limited diffusion and the m1 closure scheme fail to capture second order energy exchange is to observe that they both bridge generic optically thick conditions with optically thin conditions , while optically thin turbulence does not fall into either category . in optically thin turbulence ,",
    "the turbulence length scales are optically thin ( @xmath66 ) , but conditions are otherwise optically thick ( @xmath67 ) , since we are far enough inside the photosphere that photons must scatter many times before escaping .",
    "it seems that only a more sophisticated approach , such as explicitly solving the transfer equation as done by @xcite , can capture this effect .",
    "we note that @xcite add an artificial viscosity to the m1 closure scheme in order to address a numerical problem associated with artificial shocks in their simulations .",
    "they assume a kinematic radiation viscosity given by @xmath68 which , as they acknowledge , underestimates the actual viscosity in the optically thick limit by a factor of @xmath69 ( eq . [ scattering_nu ] ) .",
    "since we show ( section [ sec_incompressible ] ) that the viscosity is smallest in the optically thick limit ( eq . [ scattering_nu_k ] ) , this artificial viscosity always underestimates the actual radiation shear stress tensor , and therefore only partially captures secord order energy exchange .    for completeness , we also write eq .",
