    "the precise way that galaxies like our own milky way form is one of the central issues in astrophysics and cosmology today .",
    "one method for investigating a galaxy s origins is to study its stellar populations and use their properties to piece together a coherent picture of the different stages of the galaxy s history .",
    "globular clusters ( gcs ) make particularly useful probes of galaxy formation because these luminous , compact star clusters are easy to see at large distances and appear in all types of galaxies , and the oldest gcs have ages approaching the age of the universe ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1998 , chaboyer et al .  1998 ) . furthermore , gcs are thought to form during periods of intense star formation and therefore trace the major star - forming episodes in a galaxy s past .",
    "carefully quantifying the observable properties of the entire system of gcs in a galaxy leads to important insights into that galaxy s origins .    with this rationale in mind",
    ", we initiated a ground - based imaging survey of the gc systems of several giant galaxies ( rhode & zepf 2001 , 2003 , 2004 ; hereafter , rz01 , rz03 , rz04 ) .",
    "the survey was designed to produce reliable determinations of the total number of gcs in each galaxy and to quantify the spatial and color distributions of the gcs out to large galactocentric radius .",
    "we use large - format ccds to observe the entire radial extent of the gc systems .",
    "furthermore , our survey methods ( e.g. , three - color photometry ) facilitate the separation of real gcs from contaminating foreground and background sources . as a result",
    ", we have significantly reduced the levels of contamination in our samples and reduced the errors on our calculated gc specific frequencies by a factor of 2@xmath03 compared to past studies ( rz01 , rz03 , rz04 ) .    the survey s main purpose is to help answer questions about how galaxies and their gc systems form . in particular , we aimed to test the predictions of models for the origins of ellipticals .",
    "two important properties of elliptical galaxy gc systems are that they are typically more populous than those of spiral galaxies and that they often show two peaks in their color or metallicity distributions ( ashman & zepf 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "ashman & zepf ( 1992 ; hereafter az92 ) predicted this bimodality when they proposed that ellipticals and their gc systems are created in mergers of disk galaxies . in this picture , a metal - poor ( blue ) gc population in the elliptical comes from the progenitor spiral galaxies , and a metal - rich ( red ) population is formed during the merger .",
    "a consequence of this scenario is that the relative numbers of metal - poor gcs should be similar in spiral and elliptical galaxies .",
    "this can only be tested with a careful accounting of the total numbers and specific frequencies of gcs ( both blue and red ) in a sample of early and late - type giant galaxies .",
    "such data are also useful for testing other models proposed to account for the observed bimodal metallicity distributions ( e.g. , forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 , ct , marzke , & west 1998 ) .",
    "more broadly , the low metallicities ( the mean [ fe / h ] for the metal - poor milky way gcs is @xmath01.6 ; armandroff & zinn 1988 ) and extended spatial distributions ( rz01 , rz04 ) of metal - poor gcs suggest that they were some of the first structures to form in the universe .",
    "therefore we can use what we learn about metal - poor gc systems to probe structure formation at early epochs . in hierarchical cosmological models , galaxy halos that are more massive and",
    "are located within dense environments will tend to have a higher proportion of their mass accumulated by a given redshift compared to less - massive galaxies in poorer environments ( e.g. , sheth 2003 ) .",
    "the assumption of a preferred formation epoch and constant formation efficiency for metal - poor gcs then leads to the prediction that higher - mass galaxies will have larger relative numbers of metal - poor gcs .",
    "furthermore , the exact spatial distribution of the metal - poor gcs out to large radius constrains the formation redshift and the masses of the structures within which they formed ( santos 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "we have recently completed the analysis for three more galaxies from the survey ( rhode & zepf 2005 ) bringing our total sample to eight spiral , elliptical , and s0 galaxies .",
    "we can combine these results with those from other studies to address some of the questions that motivated the survey and to investigate the possible cosmological bias of metal - poor gcs . in this letter",
    ", we present our results for the specific frequency of metal - poor gcs and discuss what they might imply about how and when galaxies and their gc systems formed .",
    "details of our data analysis methods are given in a series of previous papers ( rz01 , rz03 , rz04 ) .",
    "briefly , to estimate the number of metal - poor gcs in a target galaxy , we begin by imaging the galaxy in three broadband optical filters ( @xmath1 or @xmath2 ) .",
    "gc candidates are selected by their radial profiles ( gcs appear unresolved from the ground at the 10@xmath020  mpc distances of our targets ) , apparent magnitudes , and colors .",
    "the spatial distribution of gc candidates for each galaxy is then constructed and corrected for incompleteness due to the magnitude depth of the images , missing spatial coverage around the galaxy , and contamination from non - gcs . integrating this distribution out to the radius at which the gc surface density drops to zero yields an estimate of the total number of gcs in the system .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the broadband color distributions of many giant galaxies often show two peaks , indicating the presence of two populations of gcs ( e.g. , zepf & ashman 1993 ; gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ; kundu & whitmore 2001 ; rz01 ; rz04 ) .",
    "the color difference represents a difference in the metallicity of the two populations in nearly all cases , because the gc systems are typically more than a few gyr old ( zepf & ashman 1993 ; ashman & zepf 1998 ) .",
    "in a few well - studied galaxies , the spatial distributions and kinematics of the blue ( metal - poor ) and red ( metal - rich ) gcs have been shown to differ from each other , supporting the interpretation that these are distinct populations created in different star formation episodes ( e.g. , zinn 1985 , zepf et al .",
    "2000 ) . to calculate a total number of blue gcs in our galaxies",
    ", we use the kmm mixture - modeling code ( ashman , bird , & zepf 1994 ) , which ( in addition to testing whether a single or multiple gaussian function provide a better fit to a distribution ) locates the peaks and dispersions of the gaussians that best fit a distribution and provides an estimate of the fractional contribution of each population .",
    "the code is run on a sample of gc candidates for which our detection is complete in all three filters .    for",
    "the early - type galaxies in the sample , the separation between the blue and red gcs occurs at @xmath3  @xmath41.2@xmath01.3 , and 60@xmath070% of the gcs are blue ( rz04 ) .",
    "the spiral galaxies in the study often have poorer statistics , making definitive separation of the candidates into blue and red populations difficult or impossible . in such cases we counted as metal - poor the gcs bluer than @xmath3  @xmath4  1.23 , the typical location of the separation in the color distributions of the early - type galaxies ( rz04 ) .",
    "the gap between the metal - poor and metal - rich gcs in the milky way occurs at @xmath3  @xmath4  1.25 @xcite , indicating this is a reasonable choice .",
    "the estimated blue / red proportions of gcs in the spiral galaxies were not sensitive to the exact location of the @xmath3 separation ; using 1.23 or 1.25 produced the same results within the errors .",
    "the total number of blue gcs was computed for each galaxy by multiplying the estimated blue fraction by the total number in the system .      to supplement our data , we searched the literature for well - determined measurements of the numbers of blue gcs in other giant galaxies .",
    "we used the following criteria for inclusion of a particular measurement here : at least 50% of the estimated radial extent of the gc system must have been observed ; data must have been acquired in at least two filters , so the gc color distribution could to be quantified ; and estimates of the total number of gcs and the blue fraction were given , or could be derived in a fairly straightforward way from the published data .",
    "finally , the measurement was included only if its 1-@xmath5 error was @xmath640% .",
    "a comprehensive search of refereed journal papers yielded measurements that met these criteria for three elliptical galaxies .",
    "we also include estimates of the number of blue gcs in the two most well - studied giant galaxies , the milky way and m31 , in our analysis .",
    "the data for all the galaxies and the references from which they are derived are given in table  [ table : tblue ] .      in order to compare the blue gc populations of the galaxies ,",
    "we have calculated the mass - normalized number of blue gcs , or @xmath7 , for each .",
    "this is a variation of the @xmath8 parameter introduced by @xcite and is defined as :      where @xmath10 is the number of blue gcs and @xmath11 is the stellar mass of the host galaxy .",
    "normalizing @xmath12 by galaxy mass facilitates the comparison of the gc systems of galaxies with a range of morphological types . normalizing instead by galaxy luminosity within a given waveband",
    " e.g. , as in the specific frequency @xmath13 of @xcite  makes it difficult to directly compare numbers of gcs in spirals and ellipticals with very different stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ fig : tblue mass ] shows @xmath7 for 13 giant galaxies : eight from our survey and five from other work . to calculate galaxy masses , we assume mass - to - light ratios ( @xmath14 ) following those of @xcite : @xmath14  @xmath15  10 for ellipticals , @xmath14  @xmath15  7.6 for s0 galaxies , and @xmath14 between 5.0 and 6.1 for spirals , depending on hubble type .",
    "the relevant quantity for comparing galaxies across hubble types is the relative mass - to - light ratio as a function of type , and analyses of both stellar populations and dynamics yield relative mass - to - light ratios similar to those adopted here ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1998 ) .",
    "kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) analyzed sloan digital sky survey data and also found similar or slightly larger mass - to - light ratio differences among galaxy types .",
    "@xmath16 is shown in the figure with different symbols to indicate galaxy type and environment : circles for cluster ellipticals , squares for e / s0 galaxies in the field or in groups , and triangles for field spiral galaxies .",
    "the numbers of blue gcs for the survey galaxies were computed as outlined in section  [ section : analysis ] .",
    "the uncertainties on our @xmath16 values include poisson errors on the number of gcs and contaminating objects , errors related to the magnitude completeness of the data , and errors on the galaxy magnitudes and distances ( see rz04 for example error calculations ) .",
    "we computed @xmath16 for galaxies in other studies by combining the published @xmath12 and blue fraction with the galaxy absolute magnitude and appropriate @xmath14 .",
    "the error bars are based on the published errors on @xmath12 along with uncertainties on the galaxy magnitude and distance .",

    "the two most massive galaxies included  the virgo cluster ellipticals ngc  4406 and ngc  4472  have 2@xmath02.5 times the @xmath16 values of the lower - mass field galaxies on the left side of the plot .",
    "a factor that may contribute to this trend bears discussion before we attempt to interpret the data .",
    "following @xcite , we used a constant @xmath14 to calculate @xmath11 for the elliptical galaxies .",
    "in fact , the stellar mass - to - light ratios of ellipticals almost certainly vary with galaxy luminosity , because more luminous ellipticals are redder ( this is the well - known color - magnitude relation ) .",
    "the redder stellar populations of more luminous ellipticals invariably have higher @xmath14 in any standard stellar populations model .",
    "the detailed dependence of @xmath14 with luminosity goes as @xmath14  @xmath18  @xmath19 if the color - magnitude relation is due to metallicity effects ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) , or as @xmath14  @xmath18  @xmath20 if most of the effect is due to age differences ( zepf & silk 1996 and references therein ) .",
    "if we assume the latter variation of @xmath21 , then @xmath7 for the luminous virgo ellipticals would be reduced by a factor of @xmath41.2 relative to the value for the less massive elliptical , ngc  3379 .",
    "since @xmath16 for the massive es is more than twice that of the lower - mass galaxies in the figure , possible @xmath14 variations can only account for about one - third of the observed difference in @xmath22 .",
    "thus the trend of increasing @xmath16 with increasing host galaxy mass is significant and is likely to have important implications for galaxy and gc formation .",
    "the prediction of az92 that spiral and elliptical galaxies should have similar relative numbers of metal - poor gcs can be directly tested using the data in figure  [ fig : tblue mass ] .",
    "@xmath16 for the six spiral galaxies has a weighted mean value of 1.2@xmath170.1 .",
    "@xmath16 for the massive virgo cluster ellipticals is twice that of the spirals .",
    "we noted earlier that , even considering the possible effects of stellar populations variations among ellipticals , the difference in @xmath16 between the spirals and cluster ellipticals is significant and indicates that , in terms of the total numbers , combining the metal - poor gc populations in a typical spiral galaxy is not sufficient to produce the metal - poor gc population of a luminous elliptical galaxy . a different  or additional",
    " formation mechanism besides the straightforward merging of az92 must be responsible for creating the populous metal - poor gc populations of luminous ellipticals in high - density environments like those plotted with filled circles in figure  1 .",
    "more generally , the data in figure  1 show a rough trend of larger relative numbers of metal - poor gcs with increasing galaxy mass .",
    "such a trend could be explained by a scenario in which galaxies are formed hierarchically and metal - poor gc formation occurs over a finite period in the early universe . as we noted earlier , in hierarchical pictures",
    "more massive galaxies have a greater fraction of their mass assembled by a given redshift than less massive galaxies .",
    "if gc formation was favored at a specific epoch early in the universe s history , then more massive galaxies would consequently have a greater fraction of their mass in gcs . because the gcs that formed in this early epoch would be metal - poor",
    ", the result would be that massive ellipticals like ngc  4472 and ngc  4406 in the virgo cluster would today have higher @xmath16 values than less massive galaxies . in this type of picture ,",
    "lower - mass ellipticals like ngc  3379 start their formation later and therefore form a greater fraction of their stars at a later time , when metal - poor gc formation is no longer favored .",
    "thus they have lower mass - normalized specific frequencies of metal - poor gcs .",
    "@xcite suggested that the type of scenario just outlined is indeed responsible for differences in the blue gc specific frequencies of galaxies of different masses and environments . in the proposed picture , metal - poor gcs formed at high redshift",
    "when gas - rich protogalactic building blocks merged to create larger structures .",
    "this structure formation is suppressed temporarily by reionization .",
    "stellar evolution continues to enrich the intergalactic medium in the intervening time , so that once structure formation resumes , any gcs that are created are comparatively metal - rich .",
    "because in this picture metal - poor gc formation occurs over a finite period , and the redshift at which a given galaxy began its assembly varies according to the final mass of the galaxy and its location in the universe , differences in @xmath16 are produced for galaxies of different masses and environments .",
    "detailed modeling of how the relative numbers of blue gcs should change with galaxy mass and environment for a given gc formation epoch has yet to be accomplished .",
    "we have , however , compared our data with a preliminary calculation from @xcite in which blue gcs form before @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath16 differences we observe are no larger than what would be expected if metal - poor gcs are formed prior to this redshift .",
    "furthermore , the observed differences appear to be smaller than what is expected if metal - poor gcs form at redshifts much greater than 10 . more theoretical work is required before detailed comparisons between data and model predictions can be made .",
    "but the idea of a preferred early formation epoch for the metal - poor gcs , combined with biased hierarchical galaxy formation , is appealing as a possible explanation for the apparent trend in the data .",
    "as described in santos  ( 2003 ) , the observed spatial distributions of metal - poor gcs can help test the idea of a biased , hierarchical origin for galaxies and their gc systems .",
    "this is because structure that forms before a fixed redshift threshold is more centrally - concentrated than the dark matter distribution of the final galaxy .",
    "likewise gcs formed within higher - mass protogalactic fragments will be more concentrated toward the center of a galaxy s dark matter halo than those formed in lower - mass fragments . testing whether specific hierarchical models work requires predictions for the metal - poor gc spatial distributions of galaxies with a range of masses and environments for comparison with our observed radial distributions ( rz01 , rz03 , rz04 ) .    perhaps relevant to",
    "this discussion is a recent study by strader , brodie , & forbes ( 2004 ) that finds a weak correlation between the location of the blue gc peak in a sample of giant galaxies and the galaxies luminosities .",
    "they state that the presence of the correlation means that the metal - poor gcs `` knew '' about the galaxy to which they would eventually belong and may have been located within that galaxy s dark matter halo when they formed .",
    "we suggest that within the hierarchical framework outlined above , one might expect that because the assembly process begins earlier for luminous galaxies in denser environments , chemical enrichment ( for similar reasons ) proceeds more quickly and efficiently in these locations , so that metal - poor gcs formed in these galaxies are slightly more metal - rich than their counterparts in less luminous field galaxies .",
    "this could produce a shallow positive correlation between the mean metallicity of the metal - poor gcs and galaxy total luminosity .",
    "further study of how the blue gc systems of galaxies in the field compare to those of galaxies in dense environments would help to explore this possible explanation .",
    "we have emphasized here the links that the metal - poor gcs have with galaxy formation , but the metal - rich gcs are perhaps equally important as signposts of what has occurred over the course of a galaxy s history . in the type of hierarchical picture described ,",
    "the galaxy assembly process begun at high redshift would be expected to continue to the current epoch , with the giant elliptical and spiral galaxies of today being the product of many major and minor mergers .",
    "formation of metal - rich gcs was predicted and has been observed to occur during these mergers , provided they are gas - rich ( e.g. , az92 , schweizer 1987 , and many others ) .",
    "the proportion of red and blue gcs , as well as how broad the metallicity range of the final metal - rich gc peak is , would then depend on the exact merger and assembly history of a particular galaxy .",
    "this idea is borne out in a general sense by results from semi - analytic galaxy formation models ( e.g. , beasley et al .",
    "2002 ) , which give rise to broadband gc color distributions that have a large range in appearance and that reflect the wide variation of possible galaxy accretion histories .",
    "the gc color distributions we observe likewise exhibit a range of morphologies ( rz01 , rz04 ) .",
    "our survey data may also suggest that @xmath24 , the number of red gcs normalized by galaxy stellar mass , increases with galaxy mass ( rz04 ) .",
    "this might be accounted for in hierarchical merger models if a larger number of gas - rich mergers contribute to the assembly of more massive ellipticals located in richer environments .",
