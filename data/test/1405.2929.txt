    "this viewpoint is related to the so - called _ mediocrity principle _ @xcite , which notes that an item drawn at random is more likely to come from a heavily populated category than one which is sparsely populated .",
    "these principles , however , have not had particularly apparent success when applied in the context of extrasolar planets .",
    "@xcite used their high precision doppler survey data to deduce that of order 50% ( or more ) of the chromospherically quiet main - sequence dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood are accompanied by a planet ( and in many cases , by multiple planets ) with @xmath3 , and orbital periods of @xmath4 .",
    "taken strictly at face value , this result implies that our own solar system , which contains nothing interior to mercury s @xmath5 orbit , did not participate in the galaxy s dominant mode of planet formation . yet",

    "we use this discovery of what is a highly archetypal representative of a planet in the milky way  in terms of its parent star , its planetary mass , and its orbital period  to motivate a larger discussion of the frequency of occurrence , physical properties , and detectability of low - mass planets orbiting m - type stars .",

    "we note that the smaller scatter of points obtained with the apf telescope could be a consequence of the fact that they were all taken within a @xmath58 = 140d period , and thus sample only one segment of the stellar activity cycle .    a potentially significant challenge to correctly identifying the orbital period of a proposed exoplanet arises from the discrete and uneven sampling inherent in radial velocity surveys .",

    "we expect alias signatures at @xmath60 where n is an integer . in order to aid confirmation",
    "that the periodic signal we observe is actually a planetary signature , we must be able to calculate where aliases due to our observing cadence will occur , and then verify that they are not the source of the signal .",
    "the aliases are determined using a spectral window function as defined by @xcite    @xmath61    where n is the total number of observations and t is the date on which they were taken . plotting this function will result in peaks that are due solely to the sampling cadence of the data .",
    "because our observations are constrained by when the star is visible in the night sky , and because keck telescope time is allocated to doppler surveys primarily when the moon is up , we expect aliases at periods of 1 solar day , 1 sidereal day , 1 synodic month and 1 sidereal year .",
    "examining the window function in figure [ fig : windowfunc ] we do see peaks resulting at these periods , but careful analysis of the periodogram for our radial velocity observations shows no evidence of strong signals occurring at the locations necessary for our @xmath1 day signal to be a potential alias instead of a true keplerian signature",
    ".    with an apparent @xmath16-band magnitude of 4.54 , gliese 687 is brighter ( in the near infrared ) than _ all _ known hosts of transiting extrasolar planets other than 55 cancri . as a consequence , transits by gliese 687 s planetary companion ( which has an equilibrium temperature , @xmath62 ) ,",

    "gaps of 1012 weeks in the yearly light curves for 2009 through 2012 are due to southern arizona s july ",
    "september rainy season when good photometry is not possible .",
    "low - amplitude variability is seen in gj  687 during each observing season , resembling light curves typical of modestly active stars with spot filling factors of a few percent ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the 2010 light curve has the largest amplitude variability ( @xmath86  mag ) and reveals cyclic variation with a time scale of @xmath87  days .",
    "the other light curves have lower amplitudes and include cyclic variations of @xmath87 and also @xmath88 days .",
    "these year - to - year and cycle - to - cycle variations are also typical of modestly active stars .",
    "we interpret the 60-day variability as the signature of the star s rotation period and the 30-day variability as a sign of spot activity on opposite hemispheres of the star .",
    "frequency spectra of the complete 2009 - 2013 data set and of the 2010 data alone are shown in the top and bottom panels of figure [ fig : phot2 ] respectively .",
    "the rotational modulation signal is seen most clearly in the 2010 data , which matches up with the most coherent light curve in figure [ fig : phot1 ] .",
    "therefore , we take the @xmath89d signal as our best measurement of the star s rotation period",
    ". inspection of the 2010 photometric segment of figure [ fig : phot1 ] clearly shows the overall 60-day modulation that generates the periodogram peak .",
    "departures from perfect periodicity are presumably caused by the evolution of the spot activity on the surface of the star .    finally , we search for transits of gj  687  b by first removing the spot variability from each of the yearly light curves .",
    "we do this by successively subtracting multiple frequencies from each yearly light curve using the method described in @xcite .",
    "we removed three to six frequencies from each light curve until each set of residuals approached the precision of a single observation .",
    "the residuals from all five observing seasons are plotted in the top panel of figure [ fig : phot3 ] , phased with the 38.14-day best - fit planetary orbital period and a time of mid transit computed from the orbital parameters .",
    "the vertical bar represents the 0.0022 mag standard deviation of the residuals from their mean , very close to the measurement precision given above",
    ". a sine fit to the phased data gives a formal semi - amplitude of just @xmath90  mag .",
    "since none of the frequencies removed from the yearly light curves were similar to the orbital frequency or its harmonics , this result limits any periodic brightness variability of the star on the observed radial velocity period to a very small fraction of one milli - magnitude ( mmag ) .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the 38.14-day radial velocity variations in gj  687 are induced by stellar activity , as has been documented in somewhat more active stars , for instance , by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "instead , this lack of photometric variability confirms that the radial velocity variations in gj  687 result from true planetary reflex motion .",
    "the photometric observations within @xmath91p of mid - transit are replotted with an expanded scale in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : phot3 ] .",
    "the solid curve shows the predicted phase , depth ( assuming neptune - like density ) , and duration of a central transit , computed from the stellar radius in table [ tab : stellarparams ] and the orbital elements in table [ tab : fit ] .",
    "the horizontal error bar under the predicted transit time gives the @xmath92 uncertainty in the timing of the transit .",
    "the photometric observations when filtered using the @xcite procedure described above , and when folded at the @xmath1 day best - fit period for the planet , give no indication that transits occur .",
    "we note , however , that the markov chain models generate a five - day window for possible transits , and so a more conservative approach is also warranted . in figure",
    "[ fig : transit ] , we plot the unfiltered photometric data , indicating the range of photometric points that potentially could have been affected by transits were they to occur . because of uncertainties in the orbit , the potential transit duration , the potential size of the planet , and the error in the photometric filtering , we recommend that continued photometric monitoring be carried out to confirm that transits do not occur .",

    "we replicate the procedure of @xcite and examine how horizontal distance from a field m dwarf main sequence in a @xmath99 vs.  @xmath100 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) correlates with metallicity , as noted e.g. , by @xcite .",

    "we adopt a fap of @xmath120 , calculated with the above method ( and using monte - carlo simulations to determine @xmath117 ) as the generic threshold for attributing a given planetary signal to a given dataset . with this detectability threshold ,",
    "we use the systemic console 2.0 software package @xcite to determine the number of readily detectable planets in our m - dwarf data set .",
    "a `` readily detectable '' planet generates a signal that can be isolated algorithmically ( and automatically ) by straightforward periodogram analysis and levenberg - marquardt minimization .",
    "the results of this exercise are shown in figure [ fig : mdwarftable ] , which locates signals corresponding to 19 previously published planets orbiting 14 separate m - dwarf primaries .",
    "other than gliese 667c , there are no stars on our 159-star list for which a planet has been published by another group , and for which the automated algorithm finds no planets .",
    "regarding gj  667c , 40 observations have been made at keck , and these were used in a characterization of the gj  667c system @xcite , however the peak planetary signal for this set fell below our fap threshold when utilizing only the keck data .",
    "the bright planet - hosting red dwarfs gliese 832 , 3634 , and 3470 all have declinations that are too far south to be observed from mauna kea , and hip 79431 ( ra 16h 12 m 41.77s dec -18@xmath13 52@xmath121 31.8@xmath122 ) is not on the list of m - dwarfs being monitored at keck .",
    "the kepler mission s photometric data have been used to infer that small planets orbiting m - dwarfs are very common . for example , @xcite find an occurrence rate of 0.9 planets per star in the range @xmath8 with @xmath123 days .",
    "given the existence of this large number of small - radius planets , it is of interest to make a quantitative analysis of how deep into the expected population of super - earth type planets suggested by the kepler mission the keck radial velocity survey has probed . to answer this question ,",
    "we have created synthetic radial velocity data sets that contain test planets , and which conform with the timestamps , the internal measurement uncertainties , and the stellar properties ( namely mass ) for all 104 m - dwarfs under surveillance at keck with at least 20 radial velocity observations . to address the error source arising from stellar jitter , @xmath124",
    ", we use the median value provided in @xcite of 3.9 @xmath42 as the expected level of @xmath124 for our m - dwarf stars .",
    "this value is then added in quadrature with the internal uncertainty and applied to the synthetic data set to create a more accurate representation of the system .",
    "for each of the 104 stars in the keck survey , we have created 400 synthetic data sets .",
    "each set contains a single planet .",
    "the planets are evenly spaced in log period from 2 to 100 days , and evenly spaced in log mass from 1 @xmath48 to 1 @xmath125 .",
    "we assign a circular orbit to these test planets and assume @xmath126 and @xmath52 in each case .",
    "we then calculate the radial velocity each of these planets would induce on a parent star .",
    "a gaussian distribution with @xmath127 is used to perturb the predicted radial velocity value .",
    "each of the @xmath128 synthetic systems is passed to the planet search algorithm .",
    "figure [ fig : massperpanel ] shows examples of the returned planets for 4 of the 104 stars in this experiment including the star of main interest here , gj  687 . in figure [ fig : massperpanel ] the black lines from bottom to top represent constant @xmath129 values of 1 , 10 , and 100 respectively .",
    "as expected , the detectablity thresholds lie roughly along lines of constant @xmath32 . to determine the smallest @xmath32 value we could reliably detect for each star , we find the smallest value of @xmath32 for which a planet was found for at least 50% of the chosen periods .",
    "this median value generates the green lines seen in the figure .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : mink ] shows these minimum @xmath32 values for each of the 104 stars that we tested . for clarity ,",
    "the stars in this figure have been ordered by increasing minimum @xmath32 , and are colored by the number of observations we have for each .",
    "if a test planet lies in its star s habitable zone , ( defined as the semi - major axis at which the flux received by the planet is the solar constant received at earth ) we can ask how large the planet needs to be to be detectable by our radial velocity survey .",
    "figure [ fig : mink ] shows these threshold masses for each of the 104 m - dwarf stars which we analyzed .",
    "these stars maintain the ordering from the top panel , but now have been colored by the mass of the parent star .",
    "we see that while the keck survey has probed substantially into the regime occupied by neptune - mass planets , it has not made significant inroads into the super - earth regime for periods that are of astrobiological interest .",
    "gj  687 is the second planetary system to be detected using data from the apf telescope , with the first being hd 141399 b , c , d , and e @xcite .",
    "apf has successfully navigated its commissioning stage , and , since q2 2013 , it has routinely acquired science - quality data that presents sub - m / s precision on known radial velocity standard stars @xcite . in recent months",
    ", the degree of automation for apf has increased substantially .",
    "the facility currently works autonomously through an entire night s operations , calibration , and observing program .",
    "the apf and its accompanying high - resolution levy spectrograph together form a dedicated , cost - effective , ground - based precision radial velocity facility that is capable of detecting terrestrial - mass planets at distances from their parent stars at which surface liquid water could potentially be present .    unlike other highly successful rv facilities",
    ", the apf uses neither image scrambling nor image slicing . with a peak efficiency of 15% and typical spectral resolutions of @xmath130 ,",
    "the apf represents a critical new resource in the global quest to detect extrasolar planets .",
    "initial speed comparisons indicate that in order to match the signal - to - noise acquired using the keck telescope / hires spectrograph combination , the apf needs only a factor of 6 increase in observing time . since the amortized cost of a night on keck is @xmath131 more expensive than a night on the apf , and because 80% of the apf s nights are reserved for exoplanetary work , the apf ( with its sub - m / s precision and dedicated nightly cadence abilities ) will likely provide key contributions to exoplanet detection and characterization in the coming years .",
    "gliese 687  b s radial velocity half - amplitude , @xmath132 , is substantially greater than the current state - of - the - art detection threshold for low mass planets .",
    "the lowest measured value for @xmath32 in the catalog of doppler - detected extrasolar planets stands at @xmath133 @xcite . on the other hand , gliese 687 s status as one of the nearest stars to the sun imbues it with a great deal of intrinsic interest . in our view , the relatively recent date for gliese 687  b s detection can be attributed both to the substantial amount of stellar - generated radial velocity noise ( as evidenced by figures [ fig : sindex ] and [ fig : phasedcurves ] ) , but also to its location in draco , high in the northern sky , where apf , along with harps north , are the only facilities that can routinely observe at sub-@xmath134 precision .",
    "( as evidenced by the data in this paper , keck can observe at these high declinations , but at significantly higher expense in comparison to stars lying closer to the celestial equator . )    indeed , gliese 687 s stellar coordinates ( r.a .",
    "17h , 36 m , dec @xmath135 ) place it very close to the north ecliptic pole , located at @xmath136h , dec@xmath137 .",
    "this location flags it as a star of potentially great importance for the forthcoming nasa tess mission . as currently envisioned ( and as currently funded ) , tess is a two - year , all - sky photometric survey to be carried out by a spacecraft in a 27-day p/2 lunary resonant orbit .",
    "tess will photometrically monitor @xmath138 bright stars with a @xmath139 1-hour systematic error floor .",
    "( for reference , a central transit of the sun by the earth produces an 86 ppm transit depth . )",
    "the northern ecliptic hemisphere will be mapped during the first year of the mission via a sequence of 13 sectors with 27 days of continuous observation per sector .",
    "these sectors overlap at the north ecliptic pole , and create an area of @xmath121,000 square degrees (  1/50th of the sky ) for which photometric baselines will approach 365 days .",
    "gliese 687 lies at the center of this tess `` overlap zone '' ( which also coincides with jwst s continuous viewing zone ) .",
    "because much longer time series are produced in the overlap zone , the highest - value transiting planets found by the mission will emerge from this part of the sky ( along with the sister segment covering the south ecliptic pole ) .",
    "as mentioned above , however , the tess overlap zone has received relatively little attention from the highest - precision doppler surveys .",
    "about 10,000 target stars from the tess dwarf star catalog , all with v@xmath14012 , are present in the overlap zone .",
    "this , of course , is far too many stars to survey with doppler rv , but there appears to be substantial value inherent in monitoring the _ brightest _ , _ nearest _ , and _",
    "quietest _ members of the cohort of tess overlap stars .",
    "the latest estimates @xcite suggest that @xmath1250% of main sequence stars in the solar vicinity harbor @xmath141 planets with @xmath4 .",
    "assuming a uniform distribution in period between 5 and 100 days , the average transit probability for these planets is @xmath142 , suggesting that of order @xmath143 low mass transiting planets ( and systems of transiting planets ) will be detected by tess within the overlap zone . of these , a small handful , of order 5 systems total ( and perhaps , with probability @xmath144% , including gliese 687  b ) will garner by far the most attention from follow - up platforms such as jwst , due to their having optimally bright parent stars .",
    "our detection of gliese 687  b suggests that by starting now , with a systematic program of doppler observations of a target list of @xmath12200 carefully vetted g , k & m dwarf stars with v@xmath127.5 to v@xmath1210.5 in the 1000-square degree tess overlap zone , apf can ensure that a precise multi - year doppler velocity time series will exist for the most important tess planet host stars at the moment their transiting planets are discovered .",
