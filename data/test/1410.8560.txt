    "the merger of a binary system containing at least one neutron star ( ns ) represents the most attractive scenario to explain the phenomenology associated with short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ) , although many alternatives exist [ see  @xcite for a recent review ] . while merging binaries of neutron stars ( bnss )",
    "were suggested already in the 80 s  @xcite , numerical simulations ( @xcite ) and new observations  @xcite have put this scenario on firmer grounds . in particular , the simulations have shown that the merger of bnss inevitably leads to the formation of a massive metastable object , which can either collapse promptly or survive up to a fraction of a second emitting large amounts of gravitational radiation . furthermore ,",
    "if the nss are magnetized , the inspiral can be accompanied by a precursor electromagnetic signal  @xcite , while the merger can lead to instabilities  @xcite and to the formation of magnetically confined jet structures once a torus is formed around the black hole ( bh )  @xcite .    despite the progress of simulations ,",
    "the recent phenomenology of sgrbs presents a serious riddle for any process involving bnss .",
    "the swift satellite  @xcite has revealed phases of roughly constant luminosity in the x - ray afterglows of a large subclass of sgrbs .",
    "these are referred to as `` x - ray plateaus '' ( _ e.g. , _",
    "@xcite ) and last @xmath0 .",
    "the riddle is then in the timescales involved , which are too long if the x - ray emission is really an afterglow . the gamma - ray emission , in fact",
    ", is normally associated to an ultra - relativistic jet launched by the bh , produced by the collapse of the _ binary - merger product _ ( bmp ) , in its interaction with the accreting torus .",
    "since , the torus mass is @xmath1 , with accretion rates @xmath2  @xcite , the accretion timescale is at most @xmath3 .",
    "this is three or more orders of magnitude smaller than the observed timescale for the _ sustained _ x - ray emission .",
    "a way out from this riddle is in principle available , but it only leads to a different one .",
    "it is possible to invoke the presence a long - lived `` central engine '' in terms of a `` protomagnetar '' , that is , a uniformly rotating object formed in the merger that powers the x - ray emission through standard dipolar radiation and spin - down  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the bmp can either be a supramassive ns ( a star with mass above the maximum mass for nonrotating configurations but below the maximum mass for uniformly rotating configurations ) or a bh .",
    "the lifetime of the bmp is still very uncertain , but is likely @xmath4  @xcite , which is long enough to yield a sustained x - ray emission .",
    "however , the riddle in this case is in the timing of the gamma- and x - ray emissions .",
    "if the x - ray emission is produced by the bmp , then it _ can not follow _ the gamma - ray emission , which seems to require a jet and hence a bh . indeed , none of the simulations to date indicates the generation of a collimated jet by the bmp  @xcite , which instead appears after the formation of a bh  @xcite .     2.0 cm",
    "before diving into the details of our `` two - winds '' model for those grbs that have an x - ray afterglow , it is useful to summarize its main features .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] presents a spacetime diagram where shown as red - shaded is the region occupied by the bmp , which eventually collapses to produce a rapidly rotating bh surrounded by an accreting torus .",
    "the bmp rotates differentially for an alfvn timescale , _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath5 and , assuming it does not collapse to a bh when differential rotation is lost , it will rotate uniformly for considerably longer , _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath6 . shown as brown - shaded is the region occupied by the _",
    "slow _ and _ baryon - rich _ wind , which is approximately spherical and moves at bulk speeds of @xmath7 and then progressively slows down as part of the kinetic energy is lost .",
    "this wind can be driven in a number of ways , possibly all acting at the same time : via shock heating  @xcite , via magnetic fields and differential rotation  @xcite , or via neutrinos  @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the duration of the slow wind is @xmath5 , and in the first two scenarios the wind is isotropic for realistic magnetic - field topologies  @xcite , and will be quenched once differential rotation is suppressed . at this point ,",
    "the uniformly rotating and magnetized bmp will emit a _",
    "fast _ and _ baryon - poor _ wind ( green - shaded area ) moving with bulk speeds of @xmath8 .",
    "the bmp provides a continuous source of dipole radiation over a timescale set by the stability of the bmp , _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath9 .    because the slow and fast winds have different velocities , the latter catches up with the former , producing a shock which heats the matter locally and leads to an x - ray emission .",
    "however , because the matter of the slow wind is baryon rich and optically thick , the x - ray photons will not propagate freely , but rather diffuse through the slow - wind material till reaching a photospheric radius from which they reach the observer .",
    "because the effective speed of propagation of the x - ray photons is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the optical depth of the slow wind where photons are produced , and the shock front moves through the wind with a relative speed of @xmath12 , x - ray diffusion can be ignored until the shock is close to the photosphere .",
    "as the fast and slow winds interact , and the x - ray propagation takes place through the slow - wind material , the bmp will have spun down via dipolar emission to a sufficiently slow rate to collapse to a bh surrounded by a hot dense torus , possibly sending a radio signal  @xcite .",
    "soon after this happens , magnetic instabilities will develop in the torus , amplifying the magnetic field  @xcite and leading to the construction of a jet - like magnetic structure  @xcite .",
    "this magnetic funnel can then collimate the low - density material in its interior , which could be heated either by the neutrinos emitted from the torus  @xcite , or via magnetic reconnection .",
    "in addition , the matter ejected with the slow wind can further confine the propagation of the jet  @xcite . as a result",
    ", an ultrarelativistic jet could be launched propagating with lorentz factors @xmath13 ( light - blue shaded area ) .",
    "the dynamics of the jet across the winds material is similar to the one envisaged for long grbs , so that a burst of gamma rays is assumed to be produced as the jet breaks out , with luminosities of @xmath14 , over the timescale of the duration of the accreting torus , _",
    "i.e. , _  @xmath15 .",
    "a snapshot of the expanded winds is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "in essence , our model solves both the x - ray timescale riddle ( the emission is produced by the bmp , which can survive up to @xmath16 ) and the timing riddle ( the x- and gamma - ray emission are produced at different times , locations and propagate at different speeds ) .",
    "a baryon rich slow wind is expected immediately after the merger , which lasts for a time @xmath17 .",
    "the mass - loss rate during this time is @xmath18 , and the wind speed @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the slow - wind phase ends when the bmp starts to rotate as a solid body , which is also roughly when the neutrino luminosity drops off , and a global dipole magnetic field is assumed to emerge  @xcite .",
    "the bmp then produces a magnetic - dipole wind with luminosity @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spin - down time , @xmath22 is the dipole magnetic field and @xmath23 is bmp rotation period . after the neutrino luminosity from the bmp drops",
    ", the dipole wind is expected to have high magnetization , low baryon loading and relativistic speed .",
    "this fast wind drives a shock wave into the slow wind .",
    "the speed of the shock front moving into the slow wind , as seen in the slow - wind rest - frame , can be obtained from the pressure balance as viewed in the rest - frame of the shocked wind at radius @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the shock speed as seen in the slow - wind rest - frame , @xmath27 the number density there , and @xmath28 is the unit the baryon mass .",
    "hence @xmath29    the thermodynamic properties of the shocked slow - wind plasma can be obtained from the rankine - hugoniot conditions , which , for a sub - relativistic shock yield  @xcite @xmath30v_{2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the radiation constant , @xmath32 the boltzmann constant , and the index @xmath33 refers to matter behind the shock .",
    "the ratio of the radiation and gas thermal pressure for the shocked slow wind is given by @xmath34 when the pressure in the shocked plasma is dominated by the gas thermal pressure , then we know from the standard shock - jump equations that the temperature of the shocked gas is @xmath35 , which would be of order 10 mev ( or @xmath36 ) for the parameters of the slow and fast winds .",
    "in this case , the ratio of the radiation pressure to the gas thermal pressure is @xmath37 at @xmath38 , and the ratio is @xmath39 at the shock break - out radius of @xmath40 .",
    "this large ratio means that the pressure is completely dominated by radiation , which contradicts the assumption that the shocked plasma pressure is dominated by gas .",
    "so we must drop this assumption , and consider the opposite situation that the shocked plasma temperature is dominated by the radiation . in this case ,",
    "( )  ( ) yield @xmath41 substituting this back into ( [ eq : rmass])([eq : momentum ] ) we find @xmath42 or @xmath43    the x - ray luminosity from the shocked slow - wind when the shock emerges above the photosphere is obtained by solving photon diffusion equation and is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , while is the shock breakout radius , and @xmath46 is the radial distance travelled by the photons in @xmath47 with mean - free - path @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electron fraction , @xmath50 the thomson - scattering cross section , and the numerical value for @xmath51 is for @xmath52s@xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath47=30s . making use of ( [ t - slow - shock ] ) , we find @xmath55 this luminosity is in good agreement with that observed in x - ray plateaus  @xcite , and the spectrum is non - thermal because of compton scatterings of photons below the photosphere by electrons accelerated in the shock",
    ". a part of dipole - driven energy could also be emitted in gamma - rays , as seen in some pulsars with widely ranging efficiencies ( @xmath56 )  @xcite .",
    "after the shock breakout , the temperature decreases due to adiabatic expansion as @xmath57 .",
    "the luminosity will decline as @xmath58 as long as in the shocked wind @xmath59 . at the shock",
    ", rayleigh - taylor instabilities may develop  @xcite and particles be accelerated  @xcite .",
    "the fast wind from the bmp lasts @xmath60 when the bmp loses rotational support and collapses to a bh and a torus .",
    "an accurate determination of the mass of this torus is difficult at the moment , as numerical simulations can not be performed on these timescales .",
    "previous general - relativistic simulations of the collapse of cold and uniformly rotating supramassive stars have indicated that very little mass is left outside the black hole , with torus masses @xmath61  @xcite , although larger masses ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath62 ) can be obtained if the equation of state is sufficiently soft  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this different behaviour is simple to explain : with a soft equation of state the bmp will be centrally condensed and its core will collapse more rapidly than the outer parts , some of which will find themselves on stable orbits once the bh is formed .",
    "conversely , with a stiff equation of state , the collapse will be essentially homologous , with the core and the outer parts collapsing at the same speed and leaving little material outside the bh s horizon .",
    "clearly , if the mass in the torus is very small , then it will become rather difficult to find the energy reservoir needed to launch and sustain the jet that we expect in our model . however , present simulations reveal that the angular velocity distribution of the matter in the bmp has an inner core which is differentially rotating and an outer envelope that has essentially keplerian velocities and which effectively behaves like a `` disk '' surrounding the bmp s core  @xcite .",
    "the amount of mass in this disk is large and can be even @xmath63 of the total rest mass .",
    "it is then possible that the dynamics of the inner core of the bmp and that of the outer layers will be distinct .",
    "more specifically , it is not unreasonable that the inner core loses differential rotation as a result of magnetic braking on an alfn timescale of @xmath64 and collapses to a bh only much later . on the other hand , because on keplerian orbits , the material in the outer layers could be subject to a magnetorotational instability @xcite and hence behave as a standard accretion disk onto a rapidly rotating magnetized star , in which differential rotation does not brake the rotation but transports angular momentum outwards .",
    "once developed , magnetic turbulence will regulates accretion , which can either be on the inner core of the bmp or on the bh once it is is formed .",
    "a good fraction of the material in the outer layers of the bmp would thus remain on quasi - keplerian orbits on the much longer viscous accretion timescale , hence leading to the production of a massive torus around the bh .    following this line of arguments , which is admittedly qualitative at this stage ,",
    "we assume that a relativistic jet is launched a time @xmath65 after the formation of bmp , and it propagates through the fast- and the shocked - slow wind . since the fast wind and the jet are moving in the same direction at high lorentz factors ,",
    "very little work is done by the jet to open a cavity through the fast wind .",
    "however , the propagation of the jet through the slow wind , which has been at least partially shock heated by the fast wind , can require considerable expenditure of energy .",
    "this interaction also produces a hot cocoon that encapsulates and collimates the jet .",
    "eventually , both the jet and the hot cocoon rise above the bmp slow wind surface at a radius @xmath66 where @xmath67 is speed of the slow - wind matter at the time the cocoon punches through its surface , and @xmath68 is the speed of the jet head as it moves through the slow wind . note that @xmath69 if @xmath70 , but @xmath71 if the cocoon breaks out at a larger radius .",
    "the cocoon undergoes adiabatic expansion after breaking through the bmp wind and attains mildly relativistic speed , radiating away a part of its thermal energy in the x - ray band .",
    "a far away observer will thus see a burst of gamma - rays lasting for a time of order the duration of the jet ( @xmath72s or less ) , and a long lasting phase of x - ray emission from the cocoon _ and _ from the x - ray photons produced near the shock and breaking out at the edge of the slow wind .",
    "thermal photons from the cocoon are also inverse - compton ( ic ) scattered by electrons in the jet and this could give rise to a bright mev flash .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite the pressure balance between the jet and the wind in the frame comoving with the jet - head is expressed as @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the densities of the unshocked jet and the shocked slow - wind , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the lorentz factors of the unshocked jet and the jet - head with respect to the slow wind .",
    "the fast wind compresses the slow wind into a thin shell of radial width @xmath78 [ eq .  (",
    "[ n - shocked - wind ] ) ] , so that the density of the shocked slow - wind is @xmath79 ignoring @xmath80 in ( [ energy - flux1 ] ) , the jet - head speed relative to the shocked slow - wind medium is @xmath81 where @xmath82 while @xmath83 and @xmath84 are jet luminosity and half - opening angle , respectively . for typical parameters of @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , we deduce that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the cocoon provides collimation for the jet as long as @xmath89 ( @xcite ) , and , as a result , the jet angle is in general some function of @xmath24 , which we take to be a power - law .     is the galaxy redshift (",
    "we have taken : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92s ) .",
    "the lower panel shows the cocoon temperature . ]",
    "the energy @xmath93 deposited by the relativistic jet into the cocoon is roughly equal to the work done by the jet on the wind medium , which is given by  @xcite @xmath94 the cocoon mass and volume are respectively @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the transverse expansion speed of the cocoon and @xmath97 is its average thermal pressure .",
    "combining these equations we find @xmath98^{1/4}\\,.\\ ] ] therefore , the cocoon average temperature is given by @xmath99^{1/8 } v_h^{1/4}\\ , .",
    "\\label{tc_break}\\ ] ]    once the cocoon punches through the bmp wind , its lorentz factor increases linearly with radius , as is the case for any radiation - dominated relativistic plasma , until it attains the terminal lorentz factor @xmath100 at a radius @xmath101 .",
    "the radiation temperature in the observer frame during this phase of acceleration does not change significantly . however , once the cocoon starts to coast at a constant speed of @xmath102 at @xmath103 , the temperature decreases as @xmath57 .",
    "this decline steepens to @xmath104 for @xmath105 , when the radial width of the cocoon starts to increase linearly with distance .    in the frame comoving with the cocoon ,",
    "the average number density of electrons and the photon mean free path are respectively @xmath106 the observed luminosity is controlled by photon diffusion below the photosphere , and at lab frame time @xmath107 , this is given by @xmath108 as long as @xmath109 ; here @xmath110 is the cocoon temperature when it emerges above the bmp - wind surface [ eq .  ( [ tc_break ] ) ] , while @xmath111 is the dynamical time in the cocoon rest - frame .",
    "the observed luminosity from the cocoon for @xmath112 is given by @xmath113 the cocoon luminosity and temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ cocoon - prop ] , with the luminosity being roughly constant until the radial width of the cocoon starts to increase linearly with time , which happens at @xmath114s for our simplified cocoon model .    in reality",
    "the decline is expected to begin later than shown in fig .",
    "[ cocoon - prop ] , since the cocoon plasma is likely to continue to escape through the polar cavity at the surface for at least a few times @xmath115 , reducing the radial expansion of the cocoon and flattening the decay of the x - ray lightcurve .",
    "the decline steepens to @xmath116 when @xmath117 of the cocoon drops below unity , which could explain the sudden drop - off at the end of plateau in some sgrbs .",
    "following @xcite , we find the ic luminosity to be of order @xmath83 , but that lasts only for a short duration of time of order @xmath118 , since the jet is opaque at this radius and cocoon photons are only scattered when the jet first emerges above the cocoon photosphere .",
    "the `` two - winds '' model proposed here pieces together events that are likely to take place when a bns merges and provides an economical explanation for several puzzling features in the gamma - ray and x - ray data for sgrbs .",
    "the bmp is expected to be a differentially rotating highly magnetized object driving a highly baryon - loaded wind with moderate speed of @xmath119 .",
    "this phase lasts for as long as the bmp has substantial differential rotation , which might be for a few seconds .",
    "subsequently , the baryon loading decreases , the wind becomes relativistic and is driven by magnetic - dipole radiation .",
    "this fast dipole wind pushes outward the slow baryon - rich wind and the shock resulting from their interaction heats up the plasma , generating x - ray radiation with @xmath120 and lasting for @xmath121 with a nearly flat lightcurve .",
    "this emission can explain the puzzling `` plateau '' seen in the x - ray lightcurves of sgrbs .",
    "finally , the bmp slows down and , no longer being able to resist gravity , collapses to a bh leaving behind a torus of matter which is accreted onto the bh in @xmath122 .",
    "how much mass will end up in the torus is hard to predict at this stage and this represents an obvious weakness of our model .",
    "if the bmp has a stiff equation of state and collapses homologously , then it is possible that very little matter will be left outside the bh , making the launching of a jet very problematic if possible at all . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bmp has a condensed core because its equation of state is rather soft , then a non - negligible amount of matter can be used to build a torus .",
    "clearly , new numerical simulations are needed to asses this point that may invalidate our model if it turns out that very little matter is left in the torus .    in the case",
    "in which the torus us sufficiently massive , the accreting bh is expected to produce a relativistic jet responsible for the observed gamma - ray emission , but the jet first has to make its way out of the baryon - loaded slow wind . as in long grbs , the energy required for carving out a cavity through the wind is converted into thermal energy and deposited into a cocoon encapsulating the jet and contributing to its collimation . because the fast wind has pushed the baryon - rich wind out to a distance @xmath123 by the time a bh forms and jet is produced , the work done for clearing this cavity is much smaller than that estimated by @xcite , where only a baryon - rich wind was considered . a part of the energy deposited by the jet into the cocoon is radiated away as x - rays when the jet and the cocoon rise above the wind surface , and could contribute to the extended x - ray emission .",
    "this was already recognized by @xcite , although they did not calculate the emergent radiation as we have in this work .",
    "the emergent x - ray spectra in our models are non - thermal due to the interaction between photons and electrons accelerated in shocks .",
    "the long lasting x - ray emission described in this work ( @xmath124 duration ) , arises from two different mechanisms which are : the shocked slow wind and the hot cocoon surrounding the jet .",
    "the x - ray variability time for the two mechanisms are very different .",
    "x - rays from the cocoon have a short - time variability since the cocoon has a lorentz factor of order a few , and its structure is expected to be highly irregular . the timescale for x - ray luminosity from the cocoon to vary is of order @xmath125 which is @xmath126 since @xmath127 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the cocoon is larger than the luminosity of the shocked slow wind on a timescale of a few hundred seconds , which is the duration of observed plateau for short - grbs , and hence the observed variability of x - rays of @xmath128s is most likely due to the cocoon emission .",
    "the variably of the x - ray luminosity from the shocked wind occurs on a longer timescale and is due to the patchiness of the material of the slow - wind .",
    "the density distribution in the slow wind is approximately spherical but not homogeneous and the shock going through it produces a hot plasma with density and temperature fluctuations .",
    "if fluctuations occur in the wind on a characteristic lengthscale of @xmath129 , then the timescale for fluctuations in the emergent x - ray lightcurve is @xmath130 , and the dimensionless amplitude of fluctuations is @xmath131 ; @xmath51 is photon mean free path and @xmath132 is dynamical time .",
    "while numerical simulations are still too expensive to reproduce self - consistently this scenario , there are a number of observational features that can be used to confirm or rule out this novel paradigm .",
    "first , it is clear that in our model the launching of the jet will take place considerably after the actual merger of the two neutron stars , which is also when the gravitational - wave amplitude reaches its first maximum .",
    "hence , the observation of a grb which is seen to take place @xmath133 after the maximum gravitational - wave emission would be a confirmation of the validity of this scenario for sgrbs with extended x - ray emission .",
    "second , future observations should be able to test our model by looking for ic scattered thermal cocoon photons that should show up at energies @xmath134 with a luminosity @xmath135 lasting for about a second .",
    "finally , the detection of an x - ray emission anticipating the grb would also represent a strong validation of this model ; indeed the precursor signals in some sgrbs  @xcite seem already to suggest this possibility .    after submitting this paper",
    "we learned about the work of  @xcite , who concentrate on showing that the x - ray photon diffusion timescale is comparable or larger than the afterglow timescale .",
    "this work on the other hand considers the interaction between slow and fast winds , creation and propagation of a cocoon by the relativistic jet passing though the winds , and provides a detailed calculation of the resulting x - ray lightcurves . in november 2013 , lr and",
    "the authors had a discussion about the timing riddle , but the work has been developed entirely independently .",
