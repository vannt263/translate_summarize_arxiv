    "the in - medium properties of the vector mesons ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) in hot and dense matter have an important role to play in the low mass dilepton production resulting from heavy ion collision experiments .",
    "this has , hence , been a topic of great interest in the recent past , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of enhanced dilepton production @xcite in the low invariant mass regime could be due to a reduction in the vector meson masses in the medium .",
    "brown and rho suggested the hypothesis that the vector meson masses drop in the medium according to a simple ( br ) scaling law @xcite , given as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the pion decay constant and asterisk refers to in - medium quantities . in the framework of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) as a description of the hot hadronic matter , it is seen that the dropping of the vector meson masses has its dominant contribution arising from the vacuum polarisation effects from the baryon sector @xcite , which is not observed in the mean field approximation .",
    "this means that the quantum effects do play an important role in the medium modification of vector meson properties .",
    "there have also been approaches based on qcd sum rules @xcite which confirm a scaling hypothesis @xcite as suggested by brown and rho , with a saturation scheme that leads to a delta function at the vector meson pole and a continuum for higher energies for the hadronic spectral function .",
    "it is , however , seen that such a simple saturation scheme for finite densities does not work and a more realistic description for the hadronic spectral function is called for @xcite . using an effective lagrangian model to calculate the hadronic spectral function",
    ", it is seen that such a universal scaling law is not suggested for in - medium vector meson masses @xcite .",
    "the medium modifications of the vector mesons have been thus a subject of several investigations .",
    "it has been emphasized in the literature @xcite that the properties of the hadrons are modified due to their interactions with the thermal bath , and such modifications are reflected in the dilepton and photon spectra emitted from a hot and dense matter @xcite .",
    "dileptons are interesting probes for the study of evolving matter arising from relativistic heavy ion collisions since they do not interact strongly and escape unthermalized from the hot and dense matter at all stages of the evolution .",
    "the temperature @xcite and density @xcite modifications of the dileptons from hot hadronic matter as well as from a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) resulting from heavy ion collisions have been a subject of extensive investigations in the recent past .",
    "broadly , two types of modifications for the hadrons in the medium are expected : shift in the pole position for the hadron propagator , giving rise to a modification of the mass , and broadening of the spectral function . in the present work , we shall attempt to study the medium modification of vector meson masses and decay widths in the hot hadronic matter within the framework of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) taking the vacuum polarisation effects into account , and their subsequent effect on the dilepton spectra .    in the conventional hadronic models",
    "@xcite , the masses of the vector mesons stay constant or increase slightly , in the mean field approximation , i.e. , when the polarization from the dirac sea is neglected @xcite . with the inclusion of quantum corrections from the baryonic sector ,",
    "however , in the walecka model one observes a drop in the vector meson masses in the medium @xcite .",
    "this medium modification of the vector meson masses plays an important role in the enhanced dilepton yield @xcite for masses below the @xmath1 resonance in the heavy ion collision experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been emphasized recently that the dirac sea contribution ( taken into account through summing over baryonic tadpole diagrams in the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) ) dominates over the fermi sea contribution and @xmath4 is caused by a large dressing of @xmath5 cloud in the medium @xcite .",
    "further quantum effects arising from the scalar mesons have been considered @xcite along with the rha for the baryon sector in the context of vector meson mass modifications in strange hadronic matter @xcite .",
    "the present method is a step in that direction of studying medium modifications of the vector meson properties including such quantum effects from the scalar mesons in a self  consistent manner , along with those arising from the baryon sector .",
    "it was earlier demonstrated in a nonperturbative formalism that a realignment of the ground state with baryon - antibaryon condensates is equivalent to the relativistic hartree approximation @xcite .",
    "the ground state for the nuclear matter was extended to include sigma condensates to take into account the quantum correction effects from the scalar meson sector @xcite .",
    "such a formalism includes multiloop effects and is self consistent @xcite .",
    "the methodology was then generalized to consider hot nuclear matter @xcite as well as to the situation of hyperon - rich dense matter @xcite relevant for neutron stars .",
    "the effect of vacuum polarisations on the vector meson masses has also been recently studied @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we study the effect of such quantum corrections on the in - medium vector meson properties .",
    "this apart , for studying @xmath1 meson properties , we take into account the @xmath1-@xmath6-@xmath6 interactions , and their effects on the dilepton production in the low invariant mass regime .",
    "the pionic interactions are seen to modify the @xmath1 meson mass only marginally , as already stated in the literature @xcite . due to scalar meson contributions ,",
    "there is broadening in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 peaks , as compared to rha .",
    "this is seen to be quite pronounced for the @xmath0 meson , which leads to smearing and ultimate disappearance of the @xmath0 peak at finite densities @xcite .",
    "we organize the paper as follows .",
    "we first briefly recapitulate the nonperturbative framework used for studying the quantum correction effects in hot nuclear matter in section ii .",
    "the medium modification of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses and decay widths are considered in section iii .",
    "we discuss the effect of these medium modifications on the low mass dilepton spectra in section iv . in section",
    "v , we summarize the results of the present work and give an outlook .",
    "we briefly recapitulate here the vacuum polarisation effects arising from the nucleon and scalar meson fields in hot nuclear matter in a nonperturbative variational framework @xcite .",
    "the method of thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite is used here to study the  ground state \" ( the state with minimum thermodynamic potential ) at finite temperature and density within the walecka model with a quartic scalar self interaction .",
    "the temperature and density dependent baryon and sigma masses are also calculated in a self - consistent manner in the formalism .",
    "the ansatz functions involved in such an approach are determined through functional minimisation of the thermodynamic potential .",

    ". since we are interested in symmetric nuclear matter , the isovector rho meson does not contribute .",
    "the quartic coupling term in @xmath9 is necessary for the sigma condensates to exist , through a vacuum realignment @xcite .",
    "our calculations thus include the quantum effects arising from the sigma meson in addition to the mean field contribution from the the quartic self interaction of the scalar meson .",
    "we retain the quantum nature of both the nucleon and the scalar meson fields , whereas the vector @xmath0 meson is treated as a classical field , using the mean field approximation for the @xmath0 meson , given as @xmath14 .",
    "the reason is that without higher  order term for the @xmath0 meson , the quantum effects generated due to the @xmath0 meson through the present variational ansatz turn out to be zero .",
    "we then write down the expressions for the thermodynamic quantities including the quantum effects .",

    "the summation over @xmath107 arises from the bose - einstein distribution function for the @xmath1 meson .",

    "hence , the medium modifications of the vector mesons get reflected in the dilepton spectra through the shift and broadening of the peaks .    the invariant mass distribution of lepton pairs from the decays of vector mesons is given by a generalization of the breit wigner formula as @xcite @xmath114 in the above",

    "the total width @xmath121 is the rate at which the particles equilibriate and relax to chemical equilibrium .",

    "each quantity studied , we compare the results of the relativistic hartree approximation ( rha ) , which was already treated in ref .",

    "the values of the incompressibility corresponding to these self couplings are 401 mev ( for @xmath128=1.8 ) and 329 mev ( for @xmath128=5 ) .",
    "these values are smaller than the mean field result of 545 mev as well as the relativistic hartree result ( @xmath128=0 ) of 450 mev .",
    "this is because an increase of @xmath128 leads to weaker potentials of the @xmath9 and @xmath0 mesons and to a softening of the equation of state .",
    "the parameters of the model are adjusted to fit nuclear matter , corresponding to a saturation density of @xmath131 = 0.193/@xmath132 .",
    "the fitted values for the scaled coupling constants are @xmath133 183.3 , 167.5 and 137.9 , and @xmath134 114.7 , 96.45 , and 63.7 for @xmath135 ( i.e. , rha ) , 1.8 , and 5 , respectively .",
    "when discussing dilepton production , we do not attempt to give a realistic description of specific experimental results . for this , the dynamic space - time evolution for the hot hadronic matter in the course of a nuclear collision would have to be addressed and additional effects contributing to the dilepton spectrum would have to be included . however , our study should help to elucidate , in which way in - medium vacuum effects can have an influence on experimentally observable quantities .",
    "we first discuss the effect of quantum corrections on the in - medium nucleonic properties for hot nuclear matter @xcite . in fig .",
    "1a , we plot the temperature dependence of the nucleon mass for the baryon density @xmath136 and the nuclear matter density @xmath137 .",
    "the quantum corrections arising from the sigma field have the effect of softening the equation of state , and produce a higher value for the effective nucleon mass as compared to the rha .",
    "the effective nucleon mass was seen to increase with the vacuum polarisation effects arising from the baryons as compared to the mft calculations @xcite .",
    "though for @xmath136 , the effective nucleon mass decreases monotonically with temperature , for @xmath138 , the nucleon mass first increases and then decreases as a function of temperature , which has also been observed earlier to be the trend for higher densities @xcite .",
    "the variation in the nucleon mass is very slow up to a temperature @xmath139 150 mev , beyond which there is a fast decrease .",
    "though qualitative features are similar for the in - medium mass with inclusion of quantum effects from the scalar meson sector , it is observed that such effects lead to a higher value for the nucleon mass .",
    "we next study the temperature and density dependence of the vector mesons in hot nuclear matter .",
    "the @xmath0 meson mass as a function of the temperature for @xmath140=0 and @xmath131 , is plotted in fig .",
    "1b . in the walecka model ,",
    "the dirac sea has been shown to have a significant contribution over the fermi sea , leading to a substantial drop in the omega meson mass in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "specifically , at saturation density and at zero temperature , the decrease in the omega meson mass from the vacuum value , is around 150 mev in rha , whereas with sigma quantum effects , the drop in the mass reduces to around 117 mev or 61 mev for the two values of @xmath128 studied .",
    "a similar reduction in the mass drop , as compared to the rha was also observed when scalar field quantum corrections were included within a one  loop approximation @xcite , unlike the approximation adopted here , which is self - consistent and includes multi - loop effects .",
    "this indicates that the quantum corrections do play an important role in the medium modification of the vector meson masses . in the present work",
    ", it is seen that the quantum corrections from the scalar mesons , over those arising from the baryonic sector , have the effect of giving rise to a higher value for the @xmath0 meson mass .",
    "this again is related to the fact that the effective nucleon mass is higher when such quantum effects are taken into account .    in figure [ figf2 m ]",
    ", we illustrate the medium modification for the @xmath1 meson mass with the vector and tensor couplings to the nucleons being fixed from the nn forward dispersion relation @xcite . the values for these couplings",
    "are given as @xmath141=0.55 and @xmath142=6.1 .",
    "we notice that the decrease in the @xmath1 meson mass with increase in temperature is much sharper than that of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "such a behaviour of the @xmath1 meson undergoing a much larger medium modification was also observed earlier @xcite within the relativistic hartree approximation for the nucleons .",
    "this indicates that the tensor coupling , which is negligible for the @xmath0 meson , plays a significant role for the @xmath1 meson . with inclusion of quantum corrections from the scalar meson",
    ", the qualitative comparison between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons remains the same , though these effects are generally seen to lead to larger values for the vector meson masses .",
    "we have also calculated the contribution to the @xmath1 meson mass arising from pion loops through the @xmath143 coupling , but this was found to lead to a marginal increase of at most 1% , in agreement with @xcite .    in figure [ figf3 m ] , the decay widths for the @xmath1 meson with and without the scalar quantum corrections , over the relativistic hartree approximation , are considered .",
    "such quantum effects lead to an appreciable increase in the decay widths , which , as we shall see , is observed as a broadening of the @xmath1-peak in the dilepton spectra .    in figure [ figf4 m ] , the decay width for the @xmath0 meson is seen to have a positive contribution arising from the @xmath9-meson quantum effect as compared to rha .",
    "the decay width is calculated as arising from the processes @xmath69 as well as @xmath80 , a channel which becomes possible with the mass modifications of the vector mesons in the medium .",
    "it is seen that the channel @xmath144 opens for temperature greater than around 180 mev for @xmath136 , whereas it is observed even at zero temperature at nuclear matter saturation density .",
    "we might note that the collisional modification to the @xmath0 width , arising from the process @xmath145 @xcite , has not been taken into account in the present calculations .",
    "the dilepton spectra for the low invariant mass regime , at t=200 mev are shown in figures [ figf5 m ] and [ figf6 m ] calculated for densities @xmath136 and @xmath138 .",
    "the total dilepton spectra along with contributions arising from pion annihilation and direct decays of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons , are displayed in figures 5a and 6a .",
    "the effect of sigma condensates shifts the peak position for the vector mesons to higher values as compared to rha , and also results in a broadening of the peaks in the dilepton spectra as can be seen from figures 5b and 6b .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0 peaks are well separated due to the fact that the @xmath1 meson mass gets much larger medium modification as compared to the @xmath0 meson , which would not be the case in the absence of medium effects .",
    "the omega peak is seen to be smeared due to scalar meson quantum corrections .",
    "the broadening of the @xmath0 peak due to @xmath9-quantum effects is more clearly visible for @xmath138 than for zero density , in the dilepton spectra .",
    "the dominant contributions to the dilepton enhancement are from pion annihilation and @xmath1 meson decay , which are plotted in figures 5c and 6c in comparison with the rha results .",
    "the effect of @xmath9 condensates leads to a higher value for the peak position as well as broadening of the @xmath1-peak .",
    "the dilepton production rates due to the @xmath0 meson decay are displayed in figures 5d and 6d .",
    "it is observed that the broadening of the @xmath0 peak due to scalar quantum corrections is larger for @xmath131 than for zero density .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that there is a larger modification of the omega width due to scalar quantum effects for higher densities .",
    "there have been various mechanisms under discussion which can lead to an increase in the @xmath0 width .",
    "it has been argued that the @xmath0 decay width can increase by an order of magnitude due to the reduction in the pion decay constant related with chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . the medium modification due to scalar meson quantum effects giving rise to higher values for the @xmath1 meson mass and decay width are reflected in the dilepton spectra .",
    "the medium modification for the vector meson masses depend more sensitively on the density than on temperature",
    ". this can give rise to an enhancement of the dilepton production rate when matter is highly compressed at the initial stage of a heavy ion collision .",
    "in the dls experiments for a - a collisions at 1 agev , there have been models that focus on density induced change for the @xmath1 meson mass to describe the dilepton pair production for invariant mass of dilepton pair , @xmath146gev @xcite . even though there is dilepton enhancement arising from the density  modified @xmath1 mass , the results still underestimate the dls data by a factor of 2 - 3 @xcite .    the mass modifications for the vector meson masses with density are plotted in figure [ figf7 ] , for temperature t= 100 mev . the trend is a sharp decrease of the masses with density up to @xmath147 , and then a rise for higher values of @xmath140 . the observed trend is due to the competing effects of vacuum polarisation which leads to a reduction in the mass , and the density dependent dressing for the vector self energy causing an increase in the meson mass .",
    "such a behaviour of the vector meson mass for the @xmath0 meson was also observed earlier @xcite",
    ". a higher value of the scalar self interaction coupling , @xmath128 , leads to a higher value for the vector meson masses .",
    "the change in the @xmath1 meson mass for higher densities is seen to be rather slow which means that there is a delicate cancellation between the feynman and the density dependent parts of the vector self energy . as depicted in figure [ figf7 ]",
    ", the @xmath0 meson mass seems to be more dominated by the density dependent contributions for higher densities .",
    "the decay widths are plotted in figure [ figf8 ] . the slow change in @xmath1 meson mass for higher densities",
    "is reflected in the in - medium @xmath1-decay width , while the @xmath0 decay width @xmath148 grows strongly with density and gets strongly enhanced by quantum effects from the @xmath9 meson .",
    "the dilepton spectra for @xmath149 mev and @xmath150 are plotted in figures [ figf91 ] and [ figf92 ] .",
    "these values should be typical for the compression zone of a nuclear collision at energies of a few gev per nucleon .",
    "for example , for inclusive ca+ca collisions at 1 agev studied by the dls collaboration @xcite , maximum temperatures and densities in this range were extracted from a transport model @xcite . in figure 9a ,",
    "the total dilepton spectrum is plotted , for @xmath128=1.8 , displaying the individual contributions .",
    "figure 9b shows that the sigma quantum corrections lead to a broadening of the peaks in the dilepton spectra , which is seen to be more appreciable for the higher value of the scalar self coupling , @xmath128 .",
    "the individual contributions to the dilepton spectra , plotted in figure [ figf92 ] , illustrate the effect of @xmath9 quantum corrections .",
    "finally , the density dependence for the dilepton spectra is shown for temperature @xmath149 mev in figures [ figf101 ] and [ figf102 ] for couplings @xmath128 as 1.8 and 5 , respectively , in comparison with the rha results .",
    "the vector meson masses decreasing with density up to around twice the nuclear matter density and then slowly increasing or staying constant , are reflected in the dilepton spectra through the peak positions .",
    "one might notice that the broadening of the peaks due to @xmath9- quantum effects is larger for higher densities and is more pronounced for the @xmath0 peak .",
    "the curves for densities twice and four times nuclear matter density in figure [ figf102 ] are coincident up to a value of the invariant mass of about 0.6 gev .",
    "this is due to the fact that the rho meson properties whose effects are relevant for that mass region , remain almost constant for @xmath128=5 . beyond that however , they are different around the invariant mass region for the omega meson . due to substantial increase in the decay width of the @xmath0 meson with density the @xmath0 peak",
    "is almost smeared out even at nuclear matter density and the omega loses its quasi particle nature .",
    "the corrections from the scalar meson quantum effects are thus seen to be appreciable .",
    "to summarize , we have considered in the present paper , the modifications of the vector meson ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) properties due to quantum correction effects in hot and dense nuclear matter and their effect on dilepton spectra .",
    "the baryonic properties , as modified due to such effects , subsequently determine the vector meson masses and decay widths in the hot and dense hadronic matter .",
    "it has been recently emphasized that the dirac sea contribution dominates over the fermi sea , thus implying that the vacuum polarisation effects arising from the baryonic sector do play an important role in the vector meson properties in a medium .",
    "we consider the hadronic properties as modified arising due to the quantum effects from the baryon and scalar meson sectors and investigate their effect on the dilepton production rate .",
    "the effect of the scalar meson quantum corrections leads to an increase in the vector meson masses and decay widths .",
    "the effect on the omega meson decay width is particularly more pronounced at higher densities , than in the rha .",
    "the value for @xmath149 mev is modified from 67 mev ( for rha ) to 125 mev ( for @xmath128=1.8 ) and 251 mev ( for @xmath128=5 ) for @xmath151=2 , and for @xmath151=4 the rha value of 101 mev is modified to 175 mev and 370 mev , for @xmath128=1.8 and 5 , respectively .    in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the effect of quantum corrections arising from the scalar meson over those resulting from the baryon sector ( given through the summing over baryonic tadpole diagrams in the relativistic hartree approximation ) .",
    "the quantum corrections from the @xmath9-meson give rise to a higher value for the vector meson masses as compared to keeping only quantum effects from the baryons .",
    "there is also an appreciable increase in the decay widths in the presence of these quantum corrections , and this is reflected in the invariant mass plot for dilepton spectra through the broadening of the peaks . for the @xmath0 meson , an appreciable broadening arising due to sigma meson quantum effects leads to the disappearance of the peak from the spectra for high densities when @xmath0 ceases to be exist as a quasi particle .",
    "the density dependence of in - medium properties of the vector mesons and their subsequent effects on the dilepton spectra have been studied , which will be relevant for highly compressed matter at the early stage of a heavy ion collision .",
