    "many optical media are based on bragg gratings ( bgs ) , which are built as modulations of the local refractive index with the spatial period close to the half - wavelength of the electromagnetic field .",
    "fiber bgs , which operate in the temporal domain , are used in numerous applications , and are also a subject of fundamental studies @xcite .",
    "the interplay of the bg with the nonlinearity of the fiber material gives rise to gap solitons @xcite-@xcite , which were originally predicted as analytical solutions @xcite-@xcite , and then created in experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "spatial bg solitons were predicted too , using periodic gratings written on a planar waveguide @xcite - spatial3 or in a photonic crystal @xcite .",
    "solitons can also be supported by a combination of the bg with the second - harmonic - generating @xcite-@xcite or resonant ( two - level ) @xcite nonlinearity .",
    "the variety of modes supported by the bgs and their potential applications can be expanded by using various superstructures created on top of regular gratings .",
    "the technology of the creation of such complex gratings in optical fibers became available long ago @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , supergratings give rise to additional spectral bandgaps , in addition to the central one induced by the underlying uniform bg theory .",
    "theoretical models of the supergratings , incorporating the nonlinearity of the material , were developed in detail @xcite - deep2 .",
    "another example of the superstructure is known in the form of the moir pattern , with a sinusoidal modulation imposed on the periodic variation of the refractive index building the ordinary bg .",
    "it gives rise to a narrow transmission band in the middle of the central gap ( resembling the effect of the electromagnetically - induced transparency ) , which was proposed khurgin , moire2 and implemented experimentally @xcite for the retardation of light in the bg .",
    "it is also possible to design bg superstructures patterns in a semi - discrete \" form , i.e. , as a uniform nonlinear waveguide with periodically inserted narrow bragg reflectors @xcite , and as a more general scheme , which makes use of a periodic modulation of the bg chirp and local bragg reflectivity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "complex grating patterns can be readily written in photonic crystals and photonic - crystal fibers @xcite .",
    "another relevant setting is a uniform nonlinear bg with one or several local defects ( rather than defect lattices ) @xcite-@xcite . in particular , solitons pinned to a defect represented by a @xmath0-functional perturbation of the local refractive index or bragg reflectivity can be found in an exact analytical form @xcite .",
    "the delta - function approximates a bg with a narrow embedded layer carrying large reflectivity of the opposite sign .",
    "interesting results are also produced by models which include symmetric pairs of defects : repulsive ones form cavities trapping solitons which perform shuttle oscillations , while attractive pairs give rise to pinned states featuring spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the interaction of moving bg solitons with weak local defects can be described by means of the perturbation theory which was developed in detail in refs .",

    "the same coupled - mode system may be realized in the spatial domain , i.e. , for planar waveguides instead of fibers .",
    "a local finite - width defect corresponding to @xmath10which describes a local depression of the bragg reflectivity , was studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "because such a defect attracts the wave fields , it can support localized pinned modes , including defect modes ( dms ) in the linearized version of the model .",
    "the dms and their nonlinear extension were constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of numerical methods , and the stability of the nonlinear pinned modes was investigated .",
    "it was found that the instability is caused by resonances of perturbations with the continuous spectrum .",
    "the aim of the present work is to introduce a similar but simpler and , in a certain sense , more general , configuration , with a gapless layer placed between two semi - infinite gratings .",
    "we define two versions of this system . in one ,",
    "the semi - infinite bgs are mutually symmetric , with a possible phase shift ( @xmath11 ) between them : @xmath12where @xmath13 for @xmath14 may be fixed by obvious rescaling , provided that reflectivity @xmath15 takes equal absolute values in both semi - infinite gratings .",
    "the second system is composed of asymmetric bgs , with unequal reflectivities , @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( here we set @xmath18 ) : @xmath19    the presence of parameter @xmath11 in either version , based on eq . ( kappa ) or ( [ kappa2 ] ) , is an essential generalization in comparison with the model based on eq .",
    "( [ goodman ] ) . a still more general configuration , with a phase shift between asymmetric bgs , is possible too , but such system with the double complexity is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "another advantage of the defects with the simple shapes defined by eqs .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) and ( [ kappa2 ] ) is that it is much easier to realize them in the experiment .",
    "further , we demonstrate below that both linear dms and gap solitons pinned by the gapless layer can be found in an analytical form , which is not possible in the case of the more sophisticated profile ( [ goodman ] ) .",
    "in particular , we conclude that the nonlinear extension of the dms fully merges into families of the pinned solitons .",
    "it is necessary to mention that eq .",
    "( [ cme ] ) neglects the ordinary dispersion or diffraction in the gapless layer , in the temporal and spatial implementations of the bg , respectively .",
    "this assumption is relevant if the respective dispersion / diffraction length , corresponding to @xmath20 , is much larger than the characteristic soliton - formation length , @xmath21 .",
    "note that , in physical units , @xmath22 ( this scale plays a dominant role below ) corresponds to length @xmath23 mm , in the spatial and temporal domains alike , and , in either case , @xmath21 takes values between 1 mm and 1 cm @xcite-@xcite , @xcite . with the carrier wavelength @xmath24 @xmath25 m",

    "we have introduced two models of the kerr - nonlinear optical medium , which include two semi - infinite bgs ( bragg gratings ) , separated by the grating - free ( gapless ) layer of width @xmath20 . in the symmetric model",
