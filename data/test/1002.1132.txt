    "it is presumed that quantum gravitational effects would become important at length scales of the order of the planck length , @xmath0 . at these scales",
    ", it seems quite likely that the description of the spacetime structure in terms of a metric , as well as certain notions of standard quantum field theory , would have to undergo drastic changes .",
    "since any quantum field has virtual excitations of arbitrary high energy , which probe arbitrarily small scales , it follows that the conventional quantum field theory can only be an approximate description that is valid at energies smaller than the planck energy .",
    "in particular , one hopes that , in a complete theory , gravity would provide an effective cut off at the planck scale .",
    "some very general considerations based on the principle of equivalence and the uncertainty principle seem to strongly indicate that it may not be possible to operationally define spacetime events beyond an accuracy of the order of @xmath1@xcite .",
    "therefore , one may consider @xmath1 as the ` zero point length ' of spacetime intervals .",
    "the existence of a fundamental length implies that processes involving energies higher than the planck energies will be suppressed , thereby improving the ultra - violet behavior of the theory .",
    "however , according to a theorem due to weinberg , the momentum space propagator of any lorentz invariant and local field theory _ has _ to behave as  @xmath2 in the ultra - violet limit  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the short - distance behavior of the propagators have to be improved , one has to either break lorentz invariance or include non - local terms in the field theory . in this talk",
    ", we shall focus on a latter approach that is based on the _ hypothesis of path - integral duality _ @xcite . in flat space - time",
    ", it has been shown that the modified propagators obtained using the duality principle are lorentz invariant and ultra - violet finite .",
    "we shall extend this analysis to space - times with constant curvature and explicitly show that the two - point function of the scalar field in these space - times are finite in the coincident limit  @xcite .",
    "the basic postulate is that the path integral amplitude of a point relativistic particle is invariant under the ` duality transformation ' @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the proper length of the path  @xcite .",
    "the specific prescription being that the original sum over the paths is modified to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of the relativistic particle .",
    "it can be shown that the resulting , modified momentum space propagator has the following forms in the infra - red and the ultra - violet limits : @xmath7 it is interesting to note that the modified propagator probably corresponds to a field theory with infinite derivatives and is therefore likely to be highly non - local  @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned , in flat space - time , the hypothesis of path - integral duality renders the propagator ultra - violet finite .",
    "it is then natural to enquire whether the hypothesis performs in a similar fashion in an arbitrary curved space - time as well .",
    "it turns out to be a formidable tasks to compute the propagator in an arbitrary background . to make the calculations tractable , we focus on space - times of constant curvature , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider ( i )  the einstein static spacetime in @xmath9-dimensions [ i.e. @xmath10 , ( ii )  the de sitter and the anti - de sitter spacetimes in @xmath9-dimensions [ i.e. euclidean @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and ( iii )  the anti - de sitter spacetime in @xmath13-dimensions [ i.e. euclidean @xmath14 .    upon using the schwinger s proper time representation",
    ", we find that we can evaluate the modified propagator for a massive scalar field in the above backgrounds ( for details , see ref .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows @xmath15 $ ] :    1 .   in @xmath9-dimensions : g__pid(x , x ) = - ( ) _ xx^1/2 - h_1^(2 ) (i ) , 2 .   in @xmath13-dimensions : g__pid(x , x ) =  ( ) _ xx^1/2 ,    where @xmath16 represents the geodesic distance between the two points @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the van - vleck determinant .",
    "we see that the duality hypothesis : ( i ) regulates the theory at planck scales , ( ii ) yields modifications which are non - perturbative in  @xmath1 and , ( iii ) most interestingly , the quantum gravitational effects , as accounted for by the duality prescription , can be looked upon as leading to addition of @xmath1 to _ all _ spacetime ( geodesic ) intervals in a ( peculiar ) pythagorean way , i. e. , @xmath20 $ ] , as is evident from the above expressions for the propagators .",
    "( here , the angular brackets represent a suitable path integral average over quantum fluctuations of the background metric . )",
    "current approaches to quantum gravity seem to face two main obstacles : ( i )  construct a consistent description of physics at planck scales , and ( ii )  make robust predictions that can be tested against experiments .",
    "the hypothesis of path - integral duality accepts our ignorance of physics at the planck scale and instead , based on an underlying principle , provides a prescription for calculating gravitationally smeared propagators which can be used to make testable predictions .",
    "for instance , path - integral duality predicts that the planck scale corrections to the primordial perturbation spectrum in exponential inflation will be of the order of  @xmath21@xcite .",
    "our results here seem to support the viewpoint that demanding the duality invariance of the relativistic point particle path integral is _ equivalent _ to ` adding ' a zero - point length to spacetime intervals .",
    "such a result might be an outcome of _ the generic short distance behavior _ of the spacetime structure itself and hence could be expected to naturally appear in the ( effective ) low energy sector of the full theory of quantum gravity @xcite .",
