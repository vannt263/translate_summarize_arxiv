    "fourth , we observe that both factors on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ compo ] ) are proportional to the square to the parameter @xmath193 so it can be accounted for as a normalization parameter . in fig .",
    "[ stami](b ) we compare the transmitted pulse calculated from eq .",
    "( [ compo ] ) for @xmath194 and for @xmath165 . as a qualitatively new feature",
    "we find that in both cases there appears a pronounced dip in @xmath185 close to the center the pulse . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ stami](c ) this dip can be explained inserting in eq .",

    "( [ broadback ] ) can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ centra ] ) approximating in the first factor in the square bracket @xmath197 and introducing in the second factor eq .",
    "( [ appro1 ] ) where we have dropped the qualitatively irrelevant summation over @xmath95 . finally like for eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) we have assumed moderate times so that @xmath198 . from eq .",
    "( [ broadback ] ) a minimum in @xmath185 follows at the position @xmath199 . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ stami](b ) and ( c ) there are differences in the transmitted pulse at @xmath194 and @xmath165 making a determination of @xmath181 possible . these differences are most pronounced in the region of the dip : the minimum of the absolute square of the wave function associated with the dip is about 25% smaller for @xmath194 than for @xmath200 . because of the spatial propagation of the transmitted pulses this effect also exists when the pulse is measured as a function of time in an appropriate position in space .",
    "therefore , in principle , with a measurement of the minimum of the transmitted pulse associated with the dip it is possible to determine @xmath181 . a pulse measurement can therefore resolve uncertainties in @xmath181 resulting in a sole measurement of the static conductance .",
    "we have analyzed an analytical model for the resonant transmission of a gaussian wave packet . at zero background transmission and in the limit of a broad resonance",
    "a weakly distorted transmitted pulse results . in the opposite limit of a narrow resonance",
    "the transmitted wave is dominated by a decaying state and characteristic oscillations result .",
    "our model also describes pulse transmission in presence of a coherent and a noncoherent transmission background . in this case the transmission is described by a general fano profile .",
    "we focus on the case of an anti - resonance .",
    "we demonstrate that the characteristic effect of the transmission background is the formation of dips in the profile of the transmitted pulse .",
    "it is shown that the measurement of the pulse transmission in addition to static transport opens the possibility to distinguish between a coherent and a noncoherent conductance background .",
    "this distinction is clearest when the dip in the pulse profile is considered .",
