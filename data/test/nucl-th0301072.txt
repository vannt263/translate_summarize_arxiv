    "relativistic mean - field models , which describe the nucleus as a system of dirac nucleons that interact with each other by exchanging mean meson fields , have been successful in describing nuclear matter and ground state properties of finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "applications include the calculation of deformed nuclei  @xcite , odd nuclei  @xcite , nuclei at the driplines  @xcite , the potential energy surfaces of heavy nuclei  @xcite , and the prediction of superheavies  @xcite .",
    "another variant is the point - coupling model  @xcite .",
    "the difference between this model and the walecka model is the replacement of the mesonic potentials of the walecka model by explicitly density - dependent potentials .",
    "nikolaus , hoch , and madland  @xcite used the hartree form of this model to calculate some observables of finite nuclei and nuclear matter .",
    "they obtained similar predictive power as the walecka model , but used different weights and observables from ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain their parameter set . in ref .",
    "@xcite , rusnak and furnstahl have shown the profitability of applying the concepts of effective field theory to the point - coupling model .",
    "a more recent discussion about the point - coupling model can be found in ref .",
    "it consists of a careful way to obtain a new parameter set for the point - coupling model which is likely to correspond to the optimal minimum by combining different methods for the @xmath1 minimization .",
    "this parameter set was applied to a wide area in nuclear theory , from spherical finite nuclei , axially deformed nuclei , superheavy elements , potential energy surfaces , nuclear matter , neutron matter , up to exotic nuclei .",
    "it could be shown that point - coupling models can deliver a predictive power for finite nuclei comparable to models employing meson exchange .",
    "on the other hand , especially concerning isovector properties , the point - coupling model suffers from the same unresolved systematic deviations .    from the success of the rmf ( walecka and point - coupling ) models",
    ", we suppose that the exchange effect is already absorbed effectively in the coupling constants of the model due to the fitting procedure , but some calculations which take into account the exchange explicitly by using the linear walecka model have shown that this does not seem to be the case  @xcite .",
    "understanding this situation seems necessary and interesting .",
    "unfortunately , due to the finite range of the mesons and the mesonic nonlinearity of the rmf model , it is difficult to expand this model in the above direction .",
    "this problem does not appear if we use the point - coupling model  @xcite , because in this model the linear and nonlinear terms are explicitly density dependent .",
    "therefore in this paper , we choose the point - coupling model for a first study of the role of the exchange effects .",
    "we would like to stress that we regard this work as a model study .",
    "the aim is to check the principle effects of exchange terms as compared to an effective hartree theory .",
    "this is done for the two - body point - coupling terms of the standard rmf model .",
    "higher order couplings are treated without exchange and the pseudoscalar ( pionic ) channel is omitted for the time being .    in the following",
    ", we will use the phrase _ strict hartree _ for an ansatz that is taken from the start in the hartree approximation .",
    "we will use _ hartree - fock _ for a model in which the exchange terms are treated explicitly .",
    "if this model can be transformed into a form consisting of local currents and densities only ( no matter how complicated they are ) , we will call the result of this rewriting an _ effective hartree _ theory . mapping formally this general form onto a dirac - like structure",
    "leads to the _ dirac - hartree _ theory .",
    "we beginn by defining the basic dirac & isovector matrices @xmath2 .",
    "there are two sets @xmath3       { \\rm hf } & = &    h\\cup\\{\\vec{\\tau},\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu},\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}\\vec{\\tau } ,                 \\gamma_5,\\gamma_5\\vec{\\tau},\\gamma_5\\gamma_\\mu ,                 \\gamma_5\\gamma_\\mu\\vec{\\tau}\\ }      \\end{array }     \\right .\\ ] ] the `` hartree '' set h covers the currents initially given in the rmf - pc lagrangian .",
    "the `` hartree - fock '' set hf covers all conceivable dirac matrices as they are produced by the fierz transformation @xcite .",
    "the currents are defined as : @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "these are the current operators from which actually only @xmath6 is used at operator level .",
    "the associated currents are the expectation values @xmath7 where the sum is running over occupied particle states only ( anti - particles are neglected = no - sea approximation ) .",
    "starting point is the lagrangian    [ eq : lagr ] @xmath8 , \\\\",
    "\\hat{\\mathcal l}_{\\rm nl}^{pc }    & = &     \\frac{1}{3}\\beta_s\\hat{\\mathcal j}_s^3+\\frac{1}{4}\\gamma_s\\hat{\\mathcal j}_s^4.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    at this point , replacing the current operators by their expectation values leads to a strict hartree theory , as is mostly applied to nuclear structure problems .",
    "but we are going here for a hartree - fock treatment . to this end",
    "we chose a slater determinant @xmath9 as the ground state with @xmath10 occupied single - nucleon levels ( in the positive energy sector ) .",
    "it is defined by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 indicates the fermi surface ) .",
    "we compute the expectation value of the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagr ] ) in standard manner and employ fierz transformations to express exchange terms through simple currents.this yields    [ pos13 ] @xmath13 , \\\\    { \\mathcal l}_{\\rm lx}^ { pc }     & = &      \\sum_{i\\in{\\rm h } } \\sum_{j\\in{\\rm hf } } \\big [ c_{ji}~ \\big(\\frac{1}{2}~\\alpha_i~ { \\mathcal j}_{j}^{2 }    +    \\delta_i ~ ( \\frac{1}{4 } { \\mathcal a}_{j } ^{2}- { \\mathcal b}_{j}^{2}+ { \\mathcal j}_{j}~    { \\mathcal c}^{j})\\big)\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the constants @xmath14 stem from the fierz transformation , their explicit form can be found in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "thus we have performed - by virtue of the fierz transformation - a mapping from a hartree fock model to an effective hartree model for all linear terms .",
    "the expectation value of non - linear term @xmath15 has been calculated in refs .",
    "the results are quite lengthy , therefore it is not useful to consider them explicitly here .",
    "the exchange terms emerging from the nonlinear part of the lagrangian form a large variety of density - mixing terms , involving also products of isoscalar and isovector densities .",
    "this leads to modifications in both the isoscalar and the isovector channel of the effective interaction without introducing new parameters .",
    "another feature of this result is that the contributions from the nonlinear exchange terms can not be absorbed fully by a redefinition of the coupling constants into terms of @xmath16 and they also can not be considered as small corrections .",
    "@xmath17 constants of equation ( [ pos13]).[tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    for the @xmath18 , the fields used are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , denoting a scalar - isoscalar , a vector - isoscalar , a vector - isovector and the electromagnetic field operators , respectively . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the coupling constants and masses of each field operator @xmath25 .",
    "we find that a difficulty appears to determine the scalar field operator due to the nonlinearities making it different from a simple yukawa form .",
    "some approximations have been done to overcome this problem  @xcite but as far as we know there is not yet an exact hartree - fock calculation including mesonic nonlinear terms . replacing",
    "@xmath26 we can avoid the above problem and the standard definition for the linear field operators can be used as  @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote a nucleon , an antinucleon , and a meson wavefunction with @xmath31 enumerating the states .",
    "the operators @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 annihilate a free meson , a nucleon and an antinucleon with a momentum @xmath35 , with the conjugate operators the corresponding creation operators .",
    "d(x , y ) is the meson propagator which is defined as a solution of @xmath36 the necessity to introduce an extra density dependence in dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations that allows a simultaneous fit of the nn phase shift and the nuclear matter equilibrium point  @xcite provides a physical motivation for this replacement .    further on , we can study the connection between the walecka and point - coupling models by replacing the meson propagators with their low - order expansion plus additional parameters @xmath37 as @xmath38 to arrive at the lagrangian density operator of the point - coupling ( rmf - pc )  @xcite model in section 1 .",
    "after a straightforward dirac matrix algebra calculation we have from the gordon decomposition of the exact equation of motion that @xmath39 = 0 , with    @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\mu}[(\\partial^{\\mu}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha})\\gamma^{\\sigma}\\psi_{\\alpha}-\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha}\\gamma^{\\sigma}(\\partial^{\\mu}\\psi_{\\alpha})]\\nonumber\\\\&+ & \\frac{1}{2}w_1 \\partial_{\\mu}[(\\partial^{\\mu}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha})\\gamma^{\\sigma}\\psi_{\\alpha}-\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha}\\gamma^{\\sigma}(\\partial^{\\mu}\\psi_{\\alpha})]\\nonumber\\\\&+ & \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\mu}^{\\sigma}[(\\partial^{\\mu}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha})\\psi_{\\alpha}-\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha}(\\partial^{\\mu}\\psi_{\\alpha})]\\nonumber\\\\&+ & \\frac{1}{2}w_2^{\\sigma}\\partial_{\\mu}[(\\partial^{\\mu}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha})\\psi_{\\alpha}-\\bar{\\psi}_{\\alpha}(\\partial^{\\mu}\\psi_{\\alpha})],\\label{pos17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath41    @xmath42    let us define @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the parts of @xmath47 and @xmath48 of order @xmath49 . note that up to this point the treatment of exchange is still exact .",
    "now , if we apply the order - of - magnitude estimation of section [ sec3 ] to study the magnitude in every term in @xmath50 through @xmath51 and assume that the terms of order @xmath52 @xmath49 are small and can be neglected , it is obvious that only the first term in @xmath50 and @xmath53 will survive and the @xmath45 and @xmath46 contributions vanish in @xmath51 . therefore in this limit we will obtain eq .",
