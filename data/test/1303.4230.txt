    "a comprehensive description of electromagnetism in classical theory is given in terms of the electromagnetic field strength acting locally and directly on charged matter .",
    "this is not the case in quantum theory where a state of charged matter is influenced by electromagnetic field even in the situation when the region of the nonvanishing field strength does not overlap with the region accessible to charged matter ; the indispensable condition is that the latter region be non - simply - connected .",
    "in particular , a magnetic field of an infinitely long current - carrying solenoid can be shielded from the penetration of charged matter ; such a field configuration may be denoted as an impenetrable magnetic vortex .",
    "perhaps , w.  ehrenberg and r.  e.  siday were the first to discover theoretically the purely quantum effect which is due to the influence of the vector potential of the impenetrable magnetic vortex on the motion of a charged particle , and they proposed an interference experiment to detect this @xcite .",
    "ten years later the effect was rediscovered by y.  aharonov and d.  bohm who made an important addition by predicting also an effect which is due to the influence of the electric scalar potential @xcite . immediately , in a year , the first interference experiment to verify the magnetic effect was performed @xcite , and this caused a burst of interest opening a long way of an extensive research both in theory and in experiment , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ; the effect conventionally bears the name of the authors of @xcite .",
    "although a great progress in understanding the aharonov  bohm ( ab ) effect has been achieved since the time of foundational works @xcite , one may agree with the authors of @xcite that `` the investigation and exploitation of the ab effect remain far from finished '' .",
    "it should be noted that the concern of paper @xcite was in the elaboration of the consistent theory of refraction of electron rays in the framework of electron wave optics .",
    "following thoroughly their flow of reasoning , the authors arrive at the conclusion that the medium in a spatial region outside a magnetic vortex is anisotropic and that there exist wave - optical phenomena which are due to the influence of the vector potential of the vortex . finally , in the very end of the paper , they suggest an interference experiment to verify their findings .",
    "an approach of paper @xcite was quite different : the authors heuristically , with the use of few rather general and obvious formulas ( which are even left unnumbered in the text ) , arrive at their suggestion of interference experiments already in the beginning of the paper .",
    "a powerful theoretical background behind this intuitive suggestion is hereafter given in section 4 .",
    "`` exact solution for scattering problems '' ( which exceeds in its volume two preceding sections ) .",
    "the background relies directly on the formalism of quantum mechanics , namely on the schrdinger wave equation , which allows the authors to consider their effect as a scattering event .",
    "perhaps , this was a reason , why paper @xcite , unlike paper @xcite , had received an immediate response from the physics community .    in this respect",
    "it looks rather paradoxical that , whereas interference experiments aiming at the verification of the ab effect were numerous ( see @xcite ) , a scattering experiment aiming at the same was _ never _ performed .",
    "one of the motivations of the present paper is to provide an explanation for this paradox .",
    "let us commence by recalling the famous formula obtained by the authors of @xcite for the scattering differential cross section per unit length of the magnetic vortex ( see ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath2 } { \\sin^2(\\varphi/2)},\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the momentum of a scattered particle , @xmath4 is its charge , @xmath5 is the scattering angle ( with @xmath6 corresponding to the forward direction ) and @xmath7 is the flux of the magnetic vortex directed along the @xmath8-axis . a characteristic feature of ( 1 ) is a periodic dependence in the magnetic flux with the period equal to the london flux quantum , @xmath9 .",
    "also , one could suggest that ( 1 ) describes a purely quantum effect , since it vanishes in the formal limit of @xmath10 , or , more physically , in the limit of large enough values of the particle momentum , @xmath11 .",
    "however , result ( 1 ) corresponds to the idealized case of the magnetic vortex of the vanishing transverse size .",
    "since any real magnetic vortex ( either that produced by a current - carrying solenoid , or that inside a magnet ) is of a nonzero transverse size , the quotient of squared sines in ( 1 ) in the real case becomes a certain function of dimensionless variable @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a length characterizing the transverse size of the vortex .",
    "the transverse size effects were taken into account in @xcite , and results were found to converge with ( 1 ) in the case of @xmath14 . as to the case of @xmath15 ,",
    "it was only scarcely and insufficiently considered , see @xcite , and , therefore , let us dwell on this case at more length .",
    "it should be noted in the first place that the smallest possible values of @xmath13 can be of order 1 @xmath16 ( ferromagnetic whiskers enclosed in screening shells ) @xcite , while , in a scattering event , the largest possible wavelengths , @xmath17 , of the lightest charged particle , electron , are of order 0.1 nm ( slowly moving electrons of energies 10 - 100 ev , e.g. , such as those in famous diffraction experiments by c.  j.  davisson and l.  h.  germer in 1927 , nobel prize in 1937 ) .",
    "hence , quantity @xmath18 takes values of order @xmath19 at least , and formula ( 1 ) which might be supposed to approximate the case of @xmath20 has no relation to scattering of real particles .",
    "albeit this formula looks essentially quantum , the `` quantum '' factor of @xmath21 appears just due to dimensional reasons because of @xmath22 ; it is a somewhat more explicating to write @xmath21 as product @xmath23 , where the second ( dimensionless ) factor is vanishingly small for all charged particles existing in nature .",
    "this was certainly understood by the authors of @xcite , who never proposed cross section ( 1 ) for the experimental verification .",
    "it may seem quite reasonable to apply the quasiclassical ( called also semiclassical ) method of g.  wentzel , h.  a.  kramers and l.  brillouin ( wkb ) @xcite to solving the problem of scattering of real charged particles by an impenetrable magnetic vortex : the size of the interaction region may be estimated as being of order of @xmath13 and larger , then condition @xmath24 allows one to hope that the use of the wkb method will be adequate , see , e.g , @xcite .",
    "however , a skepticism immediately arises : how can a purely and essentially quantum effect as is the ab one be deduced with the help of a quasiclassical ( semiclassical ) method which is commonly believed to give nothing else but the yield of classical theory ? in this respect it should be noted that the findings of the authors of @xcite indicate that scattering off an impenetrable magnetic vortex in the case of @xmath15 is reduced to classical scattering of point particles off an impenetrable tube with no flux .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of the skepticism substantiated by the results of @xcite , we shall proceed in the present paper by applying the wkb method to the solution of the scattering ab problem .",
    "let us recall that interference experiments aiming at the verification of the ab effect were performed with rather energetic electrons .",
    "we are considering electrons of the same ( as in the interference experiments ) and even smaller ( down to 10 - 20 ev ) energies and study direct scattering of such particles on an impenetrable magnetic vortex , using the wkb method . whereas the authors of @xcite employed the dirichlet boundary condition to ensure the vortex impenetrability , we go further by employing the most general ( unorthodox in the language of @xcite ) boundary condition that is required by the basic concepts of probability conservation and self - adjointness of the hamilton operator . in the course of our study we shall find , in addition to the classical effect of @xcite , a purely quantum effect that can be denoted as the scattering ab effect with real particles .    in the next section",
    "we consider a quantum - mechanical charged particle in the background of an impenetrable magnetic vortex and choose a boundary condition for the particle wave function at the vortex edge .",
    "the wkb method is used to obtain the partial waves of the solution to the schrdinger equation in section 3 .",
    "the scattering amplitude and cross section are obtained in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions are drawn and discussed in section 5 .",
    "we relegate some details of calculation of the scattering amplitude to appendix a , while the use of the hamilton - jacobi equation of motion to derive the classical effect is outlined in appendix b.",

    "the use of the method has also allowed us to find term ( 62 ) which is generically independent of the self - adjoint extension parameter but depends on both the magnetic flux and the particle momentum .",
    "this term describes the purely quantum effect of diffraction .",
    "it should be noted that the quantum effect is well separated in the scattering angle from the classical one : namely , diffraction is in the forward direction where classical reflection is absent .",
    "although the range of angles where diffraction is to be observed is quite narrow , the whole ( i.e. integrated over @xmath145 ) contribution of the diffraction effect to the total cross section is the same as that of the reflection effect : @xmath182 and the total cross section is twice the classical one ; the latter is needed for the optical theorem to be maintained ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted in the first place that the ab scattering amplitude ( see ( 51 ) ) and , consequently , cross section ( 1 ) were obtained in @xcite by imposing the condition of regular behavior for the particle wave function at the location of a singular ( i.e. of zero transverse size ) magnetic vortex .",
    "however , the regularity condition is not the most general one that is required by probability conservation .",
    "the most general condition in the case when a spatial dimension along the vortex is ignored involves four self - adjoint extension parameters ( the deficiency index is \\{2,2 } ) @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the self - adjoint extension parameters enters into terms which are added to amplitude @xmath149 ( 51 ) .",
    "therefore , the cross section depends on four arbitrary parameters or , if a longitudinal dimension is taken into account , on four arbitrary functions of @xmath8 .",
    "if an invariance under rotations around the vortex is assumed to be a physical requirement , then the cross section still remains to be dependent on two arbitrary functions .",
    "the problem of seeking some , if any , sense for this arbitrariness is of purely academic interest , since the case of a magnetic vortex of zero transverse size has no relation to physics reality .",
    "turning now to the physical case of a magnetic vortex of nonzero transverse size , which is addressed in the present paper , we would like to emphasize that the classical initial equation ( see ( b.2 ) in appendix b ) , as well as the quantum - mechanical one ( see ( 10 ) with ( 13 ) ) , involves the vector potential of the vortex ( see ( 12 ) ) .",
    "however , in classical theory , this potential has no physical consequences , as is demonstrated , for example , in appendix b. one may agree with the authors of @xcite that `` the ab effect was already implicit in the 1926 schrdinger equation '' , but it takes more than eight decades before a physical consequence of the vector potential from the schrdinger equation is at last pointed out , see ( 62 ) .",
    "this explains why a scattering experiment aiming at the verification of the ab effect is still lacking .",
    "the main motivation of the present work is to make such an experiment plausible from a theorist s point of view .",
    "that is why we have taken care to prevent from any objection of theoretical kind : we have employed the most general boundary condition that is required by probability conservation and have shown how to grasp the ab effect even with the use of the 1926 wkb method .    the ab effect , as well as quantization of the flux trapped in superconductors , the van hove singularities in the excitation spectra of crystals etc , explicates an importance of topological concepts for quantum physics @xcite .",
    "the ab phase , @xmath183 , which is acquired by the charged - particle wave function after the particle has encircled a magnetic vortex is certainly the same for the particles of different energies .",
    "nonetheless , a question always is how to observe this phase in real experiments , and what are physical restrictions on the particle energy in these experiments .",
    "for instance , interference experiments to verify the ab effect involve electrons of energies restricted to the range of 10 - 100 kev @xcite .",
    "interference is immanently a wave - optical phenomenon which is indirectly described in quantum theory through reference to wave optics ( a quantum - mechanical particle possesses de broglie s wavelength and thus is subject to the laws of wave optics )",
    ". meanwhile , quantum theory provides a direct description of scattering phenomena and , in particular , of the ab effect as a scattering event . a scattering experiment with particles of the wavelength exceeding",
    "the vortex radius is hardly realistic , and that is why we are considering a scattering event with particles of the wavelength which is less than the vortex radius .    by using the wkb method in the present paper ,",
    "we obtain the scattering differential cross section , @xmath166 , consisting of two parts : one ( 61 ) describes the classical effect of elastic reflection from the vortex and another one ( 62 ) describes the quantum effect of diffraction on the vortex .",
    "the effects are equal to each other , when integrated over the whole range of the scattering angle , see ( 69 ) .",
    "it should be noted that , although the amplitude yielding the classical effect depends on the self - adjoint extension parameter ( @xmath40 ) , the flux of the vortex ( @xmath7 ) and the particle momentum ( @xmath3 ) , see ( 56 ) , all the dependence disappears in the differential cross section , see ( 61 ) ; certainly , this cross section can be obtained with the use of purely classical methods ( the hamilton - jacobi equation of motion ) .",
    "the amplitude yielding the quantum effect is generically independent of the self - adjoint extension parameter , see ( 57)-(60 ) .",
    "this signifies that diffraction ( to be more precise , the fraunhofer diffraction , i.e. the diffraction in almost parallel rays ) is independent of the choice of different boundary conditions which are compatible with the conservation of probability . owing to diffraction the ab effect",
    "persists in scattering of real particles , e.g. , electrons of energies in the range from 10 ev to 100 kev .",
    "the classical effect opens a window in the forward direction , where the ab effect is to be observed as a fringe shift in the diffraction pattern exhibited by the scattering differential cross section , see ( 62 ) .",
    "we present the window for the observation of the ab effect on fig .",
    "1 , where the scattering differential cross section and the scattering angle are normalized in such a way that the plot remains actually the same for @xmath184 ; recall that the present - day realistic restriction is @xmath185 .",
    "the classical effect given by ( 61 ) is unobservable at @xmath186 , whereas the diffraction oscillations given by ( 62 ) are unobservable on the classical background at @xmath187^{1/3}<|\\varphi|<\\pi$ ] ; at @xmath188^{1/3}$ ] , both effects are unobservable being indistinguishable from the @xmath189-background which is of order of @xmath190^{1/3}$ ] , see ( a.22 ) in appendix a. a gate for particles propagating in the strictly forward ( @xmath6 ) direction is opened when the vortex flux equals an integer times the london flux : more than 90% of the diffraction cross section is accumulated in a peak centred at @xmath6 and having width @xmath191 , see the dashed line on fig .",
    "the gate for the strictly forward propagation of particles is closed when the vortex flux equals a half - integer times the london flux : a dip at @xmath6 is surrounded by two symmetric peaks accumulating more than 85% of the diffraction cross section ( each peak having width @xmath191 ) , see the solid line on fig .",
    "thus , the classically forbidden propagation of particles in the strictly forward direction is controlled by altering the amount of the vortex flux .",
