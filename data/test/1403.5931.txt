    "metal - organic frameworks ( mofs ) are organic - inorganic hybrid solids in which a usually low - dimensional inorganic subnetwork is connected with adequately functionalized organic molecules to form a 3d framework .",
    "the fascinating structures and properties of these materials have been the focus of intense research efforts over the last 15 years or so.@xcite at present , a wide variety of new compounds continues to be discovered , because of the huge combinatorial possibilities offered by the amalgamation of organic and inorganic chemistry .",
    "this new class of compounds has even proved able to produce interesting properties for industrial applications.@xcite one of the main reasons for this success is their porous character.@xcite various applications have been envisaged for mofs , principally in the field of gas storage and separation,@xcite but also for catalysis,@xcite luminescence,@xcite or magnetorefrigeration.@xcite    mofs containing magnetic ions furthermore represent a goldmine for low - dimensional and frustrated magnetism.@xcite first , when the organic moiety of these materials is composed of magnetically inert molecules such as sufficiently long alkane chains , it can act as a simple spacer that prevents the establishment of electronically - driven magnetic interactions between e.g. spin chains or spin layers .",
    "in other words , such systems have a strongly low - dimensional character regarding through - bond magnetic interactions and , consequently , they only become magnetically ordered at low or very - low temperatures , when the one - dimensional ( 1d ) or two - dimensional ( 2d ) correlation length diverges and promotes sizable classical dipolar interactions between correlated spin blocks .",
    "second , in addition to the intrinsic low - dimensionality , magnetic mofs also show a large diversity in the type of topologies formed by the inter - connection of the magnetic ions ( m ) through the possible superexchange pathways ( m - o - m pathways in most cases ) . despite of the clear interest of these materials in the field of magnetism , hybrid frameworks are relatively little studied by neutron scattering techniques,@xcite although these methods are commonly used to investigate the magnetic structures and excitations of purely inorganic compounds .",
    "this is partly due to the difficulty in synthesizing deuterated compounds when complex organic ligands are involved , and partly due to the weak magnetic contributions to the total neutron scattering from these materials .",
    "recently , we reported a new cobalt^ii^ hydroxy - sebacate framework of formula co^ii^@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(c@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2@xmath4o@xmath0)@xmath5.@xcite the compound contains co^ii^-based magnetic chains which are very well separated from each other ( 1 to 2 nm ) .",
    "we revealed the coexistence of magnetic long - range order ( lro ) and slow dynamics of the magnetization below @xmath7 k. this new compound is an excellent candidate for a detailed magnetic study for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the magnetic chains are much better isolated from each other than in most of the spin - chain compounds .",
    "second , the chains themselves present a rather complex topology of magnetic interactions between spin carriers which are well known for their large single - ion anisotropy .",
    "spin - chains attract much attention because they provide genuine examples for testing models that are less tractable in higher dimensions.@xcite for example , spin chains with nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions display a large variety of ground states with non - classical magnetic phenomena.@xcite although ideal 1d spin systems do not undergo lro at finite temperature due to strong quantum fluctuations,@xcite slight perturbations such as , for instance , weak interchain interactions can make the quantum critical state unstable to three - dimensional ( 3d ) lro.@xcite another striking feature of 1d magnetic systems is the so - called single - chain magnet ( scm ) behavior observed in a relatively large number of metallo - organic compounds.@xcite these systems , though not long - range ordered , present bulk magnetic behavior at low temperature that results from slow intrachain dynamics arising from the combination of a large magnetic anisotropy with ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "this was predicted in the pioneering work of r. j. glauber in 1963.@xcite    in this article we provide deeper insight on the magnetism in the ordered phase of co^ii^@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(c@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2@xmath4o@xmath0)@xmath5 . in section",

    "the distance between the centers of neighboring chains varies from 11 to 21  , with the shortest path ( i.e. in the [ 001 ] direction , see figure [ fig.1](i ) ) not involving chemical connections . from the point of view of the magnetism ,",
    "the combination of these large interchain distances with either the absence of interchain chemical connection or its presence through magnetically inert molecules ( alkane chain with 9 consecutive c - c single bonds ) precludes any role of interchain interactions other than classical dipolar forces .",

    "the resulting spin topology is represented on figure [ fig.2](ii ) .",
    "in addition to these four m - o - m pathways , weaker intrachain magnetic ` super - superexchange ' pathways exist through the carboxylic functions of the sebacate ligand ( m - o - c - o - m pathways ) , leading to further terms expected to contribute to the full hamiltonian .",
    "the first magnetic characterizations of co^ii^@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(c@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2@xmath4o@xmath0)@xmath5 have been previously reported.@xcite the compound undergoes magnetic long - range ordering below t@xmath12=5.4 k , as evidenced by heat capacity ( c@xmath13 ) measurements and by the appearance of magnetic scattering below t@xmath12 as observed by neutron diffraction .",
    "the presence of a broad bump in the zero - field c@xmath13(t ) curve , between the @xmath14-peak at t@xmath12 and 2 to 3 times t@xmath12 , was attributed to the effects of magnetic correlations within the chains .",
    "a complex behavior of the magnetic susceptibility was observed above the lro transition .",
    "the non - monotonic shape of the product @xmath15 could be described by introducing two effective energy parameters ( 20 and -30 k ) which account for both anistropy and ( ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ) exchange interactions .",
    "ac susceptibility measurements showed the existence of dynamical processes at t @xmath16 t@xmath12 .",
    "ac susceptibility data were taken on a physical properties measurement system ( quantum design , usa ) for frequencies of the ac magnetic field between 10 and 6500 hz .",
    "the analysis revealed the existence of a thermally activated behavior within the 3 - 4.5 k temperature range , with an energy barrier of about 67 k and a characteristic time of the order of 1.4@xmath17 s. the observed slow dynamics was attributed to the motion of thermally activated domain walls within the magnetic chains .",
    "finally , ac susceptibility measurements performed under various bias dc magnetic fields revealed a strong displacement of the main peak towards higher temperatures , for both in - phase and out - of - phase components .",

    "two long duration neutron diffraction patterns were recorded at 1.8 k and 20 k ( 8 hours for each ) .    for measurements with an applied magnetic field ,",
    "the sample was immersed in deuterated isopropanol in order to avoid reorientation of the powder particles .",
    "isopropanol freezes around t @xmath10 115 k in a glassy state , giving rise to a weak and broad bump in the data around @xmath19 .",
    "after initial rapid cooling of the sample in the remnant field of the magnet , the temperature was never raised above the glass transition temperature of isopropanol for the remainder of the experiment .",
    "it was therefore guaranteed that the powder grains remained fixed and that the same powder average was measured in each run .",
    "a diffraction pattern was recorded under these conditions , in zero - field at 10 k , and used for subtraction of the nuclear scattering .",
    "data were then recorded under zero - field and under two different applied magnetic fields ( 0.5 and 2 t ) . for each of these three field values ,",

    "the high hydrogen content of the compound , and the diluted character of the magnetism , weak magnetic elastic scattering could be observed ( see figure [ patterns_3h ] ) . although the bad statistics preclude refinement of these data , the absence of drastic changes in the 1.8 k magnetic structure is evidenced up to 2 t. this result is in agreement with the shape of the isothermal magnetization at 1.8 k ( see section [ mh ] and ref . ) , i.e. a fast increase at very low field due to the ferromagnetic component of the magnetization , followed by a mild increase due to competition between the applied field and the local anisotropy of co@xmath58 ions .",

    "we can first look at the ( 10@xmath65 ) reflection , which is characteristic of the interchain correlations ( anti-*c * reflection , see figure [ magn_struct ] ) . in zero - field ( see figure [ 3ref_h ] ) , the ( 10@xmath65 ) intensity increases below @xmath7 k , the transition temperature determined from macroscopic measurements @xcite . when a magnetic field is aplied , the intensity of this reflection remains finite above @xmath66 .",
    "this indicates the persistence of interchain correlations in presence of an applied field well above @xmath66 : up to 10 and 13 k for applied field values of 0.5 and 2 t respectively .",
    "this is not surprising since the interchain magnetic arrangement is ferromagnetic - like , so that a magnetic field is expected to stabilize these correlations .",
    "it is worth noting that these results are in good agreement i ) with the previously reported phase diagram established from the bias dc field dependence of the ac susceptibility maxima,@xcite and ii ) with the position of the maxima in the derivative of the temperature dependence of the magnetization : 9.8  k for 0.5 t and 13.9 k for 2 t ( data not shown).@xcite    second , we consider the ( 001 ) and ( 100 ) reflections .",
    "these reflections are relevant for observing the evolution of the canting within the chains .",
    "for instance , considering @xmath67 , ( 001 ) is maximal for @xmath68 while ( 100 ) is completely absent , and vice versa for @xmath69 .",
    "the temperature dependence of these reflections depends strongly upon the magnetic field , especially at the onset of the interchain correlations when field - induced magnetic scattering is detected .",
    "this indicates significant rearrangements of the spin structure within the chains at temperatures for which magnetic field induces long - range ordering , and points toward a rich @xmath70 phase diagram .",

    "the maximum coercive field is about 0.5 t at low temperature .",
    "these hysteresis loops are strongly affected by the dynamics existing in the chains , resulting in relaxation at a given field during the extraction measurements .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the data at 800  mk or 1 k , for example .",
    "vs. @xmath71 for sample 1 at several temperatures between 100 mk and 1.5 k , measured with field increments of 500 oe every 110 s for @xmath72 k , and of 50 oe every 80 s for @xmath73 k. , width=302 ]    below 1 k , magnetic avalanches ( that is to say , abrupt reversals of the magnetization ) were measured in sample  1 , at fields between 0.4 and 0.5 t ( see figure [ fig_hyst1 ] ) .",
    "these avalanches are typical of samples with slow relaxation processes at very low temperature ( see for example ref . ) and have been observed in other ordered spin - chains @xcite .",
    "the avalanche mechanism can be described as follows : due to slow dynamics ( large energy barrier , pinned domain - walls ,  ) , when the sample is driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium , by an applied field , the magnetization does not follow the field . at a given field ( the resonant tunneling field or the nucleation field for example ) ,",
    "the reversal of the magnetization becomes easier , and spins can start to flip .",
    "then , because the system is at very low temperature , the specific heat is very low and the energy @xmath74 released in this reversal heats the neighboring spins , which in turn can flip .",
    "this process results in an increase of the internal temperature of the sample , which itself induces a faster relaxation , and provokes a global reversal of the magnetization termed a magnetic avalanche . in some cases avalanches",
    "can be suppressed by slowing the field sweeping rate in the hysteresis loop , or by improving the thermal contact between the sample and the mixing chamber of the dilution fridge which provides the cooling power .",
    "the latter was done in the present compound with sample 2 , which was better thermalized than sample 1 ( smaller size and more apiezon grease ) .",
    "indeed , magnetic avalanches could be suppressed in this sample ( see figure [ fig_hyst2 ] ) .",

    "second , the mean energy barrier decreases when the field increases .",
    "the dependence is linear for non - zero applied fields ( see inset of figure [ fig_dmdevsh ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the two - level system picture used for the analysis , in which the energy barrier would be reduced by the zeeman energy : @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the energy barrier in zero field , and @xmath116 is the magnetic moment parallel to the applied field .",

    "the slope @xmath116 is equal to 30 @xmath119 .",
    "this might indicate that the energy barrier does not concern single spin flips but rather blocks of spins of effective moment @xmath116 . in that sense ,",
    "the larger distribution width , as well as the difference between @xmath117 and @xmath115 , might be explained by a more complex domain structure in zero field than in finite applied field for which a domain selection occurs ( as shown by magnetization measurements ) .",
    "the complex magnetic structure and the diversity of the exchange paths in this cobaltous chain make the interpretation of the above results challenging . nonetheless , the observed slow dynamics has a large signal , and is very clean and reproducible , suggesting that there should be a well - defined origin of this phenomenon . in the following ,",
    "we examine the exchange paths and the relevant energy scales in the system , and present a possible scenario explaning the observations described in the previous section .      the magnetic structure results from the magnetic interactions and the local anisotropy of the co@xmath120 ions .",

    "in such a system with a strong 1d character , the critical temperature describing lro originates from the combination of the strong intrachain correlations , resulting in spin blocks exhibiting a super - spin ( c.f . uncompensated component of the magnetic structure ) , and the interchain interactions between these super - spins @xcite . in the present material",
    ", this picture is most readily applied along the crystallographic * c*-axis which corresponds to the shortest interchain distance . in that direction",
    "the dipolar interaction stabilizes an interchain ferromagnetic arrangement between the intrachain super - spins .",
    "however , the complexity of the magnetic structure makes this description much more complicated for the @xmath128 direction .",
    "the reproduction of the magnetic motif observed in this direction is not favourable when considering the orientation of the super - spins emerging from the ferromagnetic component .",
    "the dipolar interactions between individual spins have thus to be considered along * a*-axis .",
    "preliminary calculations of the dipolar energy suggest that the obtained orientation is more energetically favourable with respect to the dipolar interaction than its 180@xmath129 counterpart .      in lro spin chains ,",
    "very strong correlations exist within the chains , while the spin chains are weakly coupled to each other .",
    "the result is that when the temperature is larger than the interchain interactions ( of a few millikelvins in our case ) , the dynamics are governed by intrachain dynamics , which can be described in terms of domain - walls motion .",
    "this was observed in several ordered spin chains @xcite : dependent on the ratio between the local anisotropy and exchange interactions , the dynamics can be described in terms of single - chain magnets or motion of extended domain - walls .    in co^ii^@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(c@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2@xmath4o@xmath0)@xmath5 , the presence of two co@xmath120 sites with a different single - ion anisotropy , combined with the existence of several exchange couplings , makes the description in terms of domain - walls complicated . to get a better understanding , we return to the striking result of the analysis of the dynamics : the ac susceptibility ( i.e zero - field ) dynamics is accounted for by an energy barrier of @xmath84 k over a large range of temperature , whereas the relaxation of the magnetization ( i.e. from a finite magnetization state )",
    "can be described by a barrier of half value @xmath106 k. to go further , we will have to keep in mind that the magnetic structure is only canted by the field applied during measurements of the magnetization relaxation ( see section [ neut_field ] ) .",
    "the zero - field dynamics measured by ac - susceptibility can be ascribed to the motion of domain - walls along the chains . due to the strong anisotropy",
    ", we can expect that these domain - walls are relatively narrow .",
    "then the observed energy barrier would be due to the cost in energy ( exchange and anisotropy ) to move the wall at the domain boundary .",
    "the ranges of the exchange constants and anisotropy ( see section [ discussion1 ] ) is consistent with the obtained energy barrier .",
    "we recall that ( i ) magnetization relaxation measurements were done after a field of -3500 oe was applied , and that ( ii ) the sample being a powder , the field acts on the three directions of the crystal .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned , a fast increase of the magnetization is observed when a field is applied .",
    "this can be attributed to a selection of domains with respect to the resulting spin component in the ferromagnetic - like direction , the @xmath130 direction . in the other directions , or at larger fields ,",
    "the magnetization increases smoothly by spin canting . because of the strong anisotropy of the co@xmath1202 ions ,",
    "this induced magnetization can be assigned to the co@xmath1201 ions .",
    "this canting is effective only along the directions * a * and * c * , since the co@xmath1201 ions are oriented along the * b*-axis .",
    "when the field is removed , the return to equilibrium , that is to say , the relaxation of the magnetization , will consist of two processes : the reorientation of the co@xmath1201 ions and the creation of domains to recover the zero magnetization .",
    "it is only the second process which needs to overcome a barrier by nucleation of domain - walls inside the chains .",
    "the obtained @xmath117 value should be associated with this nucleation .",
    "the question that immediately arises is why @xmath117 is half of @xmath107 .",
    "a possible reason could be that the nucleation occurs at the boundary of a chain ( or near a defect ) , where it is more energetically favourable , thus creating only one domain - wall .",
    "on the contrary , the dynamics probed by ac susceptibility concern existing domains where the two boundaries of the domains are moving in response to the ac - field ( because the magnetization has to remain zero ) . the obtained characteristic relaxation time @xmath108 is three orders of magnitude larger in magnetization measurements than in ac susceptibility measurements , suggesting that the nucleation process is much slower .    to get a deeper insight in these dynamics , and",
    "especially the field induced dynamics , further measurements on single crystals are needed .",
    "these would allow us to determine if an anisotropy exists in the dynamics ( which should be the case in our scenario ) , and to provide a more quantitative analysis of these observations .",
    "in conclusion , we have determined the magnetic structure of co^ii^@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(c@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2@xmath4o@xmath0)@xmath5 .",
    "it is made of spin - chains involving two sublattices : one is purely antiferromagnetic , the second gives rise to a ferromagnetic component along the * c*-axis . due to the magnetic propagation vector being * * _ k_**=(0,0,0 ) , the magnetic motif is reproduced in the neighboring unit cells forming the three dimensional lattice . the magnetic structure at low temperature",
    "is not modified upon the application of a magnetic field , at least up to 2  t. only canting within the chains is observed .",
    "furthermore , the applied field reinforces the interchain correlations resulting in a higher ordering temperature which increases up to 13  k at 2  t ( to be compared to the transition temperature @xmath7  k ) . at very low temperature , in the ordered phase , slow dynamics",
    "are observed in a large temperature / frequency range which are ascribed to dynamics of domains inside the chains .",
    "interestingly , these dynamics are extremely sensitive to the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "finally , we notice that the nature of the present material , comprising inorganic chains interconnected through organic linkers , is reminiscent of other metal - organic frameworks that have shown high intrinsic flexibility in response to high pressures @xcite or to the absorption of guest molecules @xcite .",
    "this point is particularly interesting as it might be possible to tune the organization of the chains relative to each other and thus the magnetic ground state . for this purpose ,",
    "powder x - ray diffraction experiments under back pressure of co@xmath1 ( up to 100 bars ) and h@xmath1 ( up to 200 bars ) were performed . however , the crystal structure of co^ii^@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(c@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2@xmath4o@xmath0)@xmath5did not seem to be affected .",

    "<S> we investigate the magnetism of the co^ii^@xmath0(oh)@xmath1(c@xmath2@xmath3h@xmath2@xmath4o@xmath0)@xmath5 metal - organic framework which displays complex inorganic chains separated from each other by distances of 1 to 2 nm , and which orders at 5.4  k. the zero - field magnetic structure is determined using neutron powder diffraction : it is mainly antiferromagnetic but posseses a ferromagnetic component along the * c*-axis . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic structure persists in presence of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> ac susceptibility measurements confirm the existence of a single thermally activated regime over 7 decades in frequency ( e / k@xmath6 k ) whereas time - dependent relaxation of the magnetization after saturation in an external field leads to a two times smaller energy barrier . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments probe the slow dynamics of domain walls within the chains : we propose that the ac measurements are sensitive to the motion of existing domain walls within the chains , while the magnetization measurements are governed by the creation of domain walls . </S>"
