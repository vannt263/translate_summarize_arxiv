    "( [ eq : singlesite ] ) , and simplifies to @xmath129 this maximum average single - site entanglement decreases as the number of wells increase ( see table [ tbl : maxsinglesite ] ) and , for two particles , @xmath130 . in the hubbard model picture , this would correspond to the limit of the number of sites going to infinity and the average particle density going to zero .",
    "this limit would in fact be expected to have no entanglement as it is essentially a product state of empty occupations .    for @xmath131 , @xmath132 is reached for @xmath81 and two wells , similarly to the hubbard model ; however , for @xmath133 , some interaction is required to balance the propensity of the non - interacting wave - function to favor inner wells .",
    "turning on the repulsion between electrons will tend to reduce the discrepancies between the electron density peaks in different wells ( see e.g. the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltawelldensityd=2 ] ) ; however this will also tend to decrease the double occupation probability and in particular the already too low value of @xmath134 at the outer wells .",
    "therefore , due to the open boundary conditions here considered , it may not be possible for the system to reach the theoretical maximum for the entanglement by simply varying @xmath64 , as a perfect balance between occupation probabilities in different wells may not be achieved without , for example , a spatial modulation of the particle - particle interaction .",

    "also in this case we allow for attractive as well as repulsive interaction between the particles .",
    "notice that in the present case the spatial entanglement is zero when there is no interaction as the wave - function factorizes into spatial and spin components and the implicit correlations arising from the pauli exclusion principle  and the related entanglement  are accounted for within the spin degrees of freedom .    for two wells ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scaledspatialgraphs ] , upper panel ) we see that the spatial entanglement is a mirror image of the site entanglement when reflected along the line @xmath138 . for larger numbers of wells",
    "the relationship is more complicated . in most regions when the spatial entanglement increases the site entanglement decreases and vice versa",

    "this is because the spatial entanglement s minimum always occurs at @xmath81 when there is no correlation between the particles positions .",
    "an intuitive explanation for the almost opposite behavior of these two types of entanglement is that for @xmath139 increasing @xmath64 increases the repulsion and the correlation between particles .",
    "hence one electron s position reveals more about the other electron while the number of spatial degrees of freedom is not dramatically limited , so the spatial entanglement increases .",
    "however the probability of double occupation is reduced by a large positive interaction so less is learned by measurement with respect to wells / sites even though the electron affects the other s position more .",
