    "the 2002 july 16 observation of 1e 1746.73224 was longer , with @xmath87 = 8500 s , and had slightly higher count rates of @xmath89 cts s@xmath7 and @xmath90 cts s@xmath7 , resulting in a 3-@xmath5 sensitivity of 23% rms .",
    "our _ chandra  _ te mode observations were not sensitive enough to detect broadband features at previously detected levels .",
    "however , the cc mode observation of slx 1735269 , with @xmath91 cts s@xmath7 , @xmath92 cts s@xmath7 , and @xmath93 s , had a much better 3-@xmath5 sensitivity of 9.3% rms for @xmath94 hz .",
    "hence band limited noise at levels observed in the brighter state of slx 1735269 @xcite should have been detectable in the cc mode observations ; however , the observed qpo was not detectable .",
    "we estimated a 3-@xmath5 sensitivity of 18% rms for @xmath95 hz , corresponding to the fainter state observed by @xcite , for our cc mode observation of slx 1735269 ; hence we were unable to confirm this state with our _ chandra  _ observations .",
    "for the cc mode observation of slx 1735269 , we created a light curve using ciao tools that account for the fact that event times recorded in cc mode data were the times the events were read , not the times when the charge was deposited on the detector @xcite .",
