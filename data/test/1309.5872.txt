    "the original discovery of the late - time acceleration of the universe  @xcite has been confirmed by multiple cosmological probes over the last fifteen years .",
    "the underlying cause of this acceleration , as well as its connection to fundamental physics , however , remains to be clarified .",
    "although the cosmological `` standard model '' provides an excellent description of the latest data  @xcite , the cosmological constant is beset with problems of extreme fine - tuning , at least given our current level of theoretical understanding ( for reviews see , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for this reason ,",
    "it is extremely important to constrain the evolution of the dark energy equation of state , and to see if the associated equation of state parameter , @xmath2 , deviates from the constant value , @xmath3 , characteristic of a cosmological constant . while phenomenological models for @xmath2 can be postulated for comparison to observed data , one class of solutions known as early dark energy allows for the energy density responsible for the acceleration to be much larger at earlier times , with possible connections to fundamental physics  @xcite .",
    "investigations of dynamical dark energy are conducted using two distinct types of observational probes : _ ( i ) _ constraints on the homogeneous expansion of the universe , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the growth of large - scale structure , driven primarily by the gravitational dynamics of cold dark matter ( cdm ) . via consistency relations",
    ", these results can also be used to study the validity of general relativity in describing the dynamics of the universe ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although this is not our concern here .",
    "besides dark energy , a major contribution of modern cosmology to fundamental physics lies in constraining the sum of neutrino masses , as well as the number of neutrino species .",
    "massive neutrinos act as a radiation component in the early universe , but as a warm dark matter fluid at late times .",
    "the high velocity of neutrinos makes them difficult to bind gravitationally , suppressing the growth of structure in a scale - dependent manner . aside from being interesting in their own right , massive neutrinos can be degenerate with the dark energy density and the equation of state  @xcite , which necessitates an analysis including both effects .",
    "therefore , it is essential for future precision measurements to include neutrinos as a component of the analysis , along with a time - varying dark energy equation of state or a modified theory of gravity . a thorough investigation of this issue within the fisher matrix formalism is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for spectroscopic redshift surveys such as boss ( baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey  @xcite ) or desi ( dark energy spectroscopic instrument  @xcite ) , but also including input from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , in particular , planck  @xcite , and weak gravitational lensing surveys such as des ( dark energy survey  @xcite ) and lsst ( large synoptic survey telescope  @xcite ) . a similar analysis for surveys like euclid  @xcite",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "the power of purely large - scale measurements , such as baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) is significantly reduced by the uncertainty in neutrino masses , and employing broadband galaxy power at much smaller scales becomes important in improving our ability to extract information about dark energy as well as the neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "due to their large thermal velocities , @xmath4 , neutrinos do not cluster at scales smaller than the free - streaming scale @xmath5 . for neutrinos turning non - relativistic in the matter",
    "dominated regime , the comoving free - streaming scale has a maximum value at the time when the neutrinos become relativistic .",
    "thus , at length scales larger than those set by this maximum , @xmath6 , neutrinos cluster in the same way as dark matter , while at smaller scales their contribution to clustering is much smaller , leading to a suppression of the total matter power spectrum . in linear perturbation theory",
    "this suppression increases with increasing wave - number asymptoting to a value of @xmath7 since this effect can be observed at length scales too small for linear perturbation theory to hold , it is essential to compute the nonlinear matter power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the effect of neutrinos at sufficiently large length scales can be studied using perturbation theory ; at smaller length scales , matter clustering treated via n - body methods can be used to extend the predictive reach . moreover , in view of the above discussion , this has to be done in the presence of a varying dark energy equation of state .",
    "our purpose here is to present both perturbative and n - body results for the matter fluctuation power spectrum in the presence of neutrinos and dynamical dark energy .",
    "( we do not consider the case of modified gravity here . )",
    "our results are useful in multiple ways .",
    "first , they provide reliable predictions for the matter power spectrum on large scales for ongoing and upcoming bao measurements like boss  @xcite , desi  @xcite , and chime ( the canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment  @xcite ) , in particular at higher redshifts .",
    "second , in order to build prediction tools for power spectra well into the nonlinear regime , perturbation theory is very useful to anchor the predictions at high accuracy on large scales .",
    "previously , based on a finite number of cosmological models , we have produced emulators for the power spectrum enabling fast parameter estimation of @xmath8cdm cosmologies  @xcite . however , ongoing and future surveys will attempt to go beyond @xmath8cdm to constrain both neutrino masses and a time dependent equation of state of dark energy . in preparation for such surveys ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we use the hacc ( hardware / hybrid accelerated cosmology code ) n - body framework  @xcite , extended to include both a time varying dark energy equation of state and an approximate treatment of massive neutrinos , to compute the matter power spectrum .",
    "third , the accurate treatment of neutrinos in n - body simulations is non - trivial as discussed in more detail below .",
    "we study the validity of different higher order perturbation theory implementations for a @xmath9cdm cosmology for which we have high - accuracy simulations .",
    "we then use these results to gauge the inaccuracies induced by an approximate treatment of neutrinos in simulations .",
    "dynamical dark energy can be treated in two different ways .",
    "one can either begin with a model , specified by an action , and aim to constrain its parameters .",
    "for example , a scalar field quintessence model  @xcite can be written down with a power law potential whose parameters can then be determined by the data .",
    "such models can be subdivided , for example , into `` freezing '' and `` thawing '' classes , in which the scalar field moves respectively toward or away from a stationary point in its potential  @xcite .",
    "canonical scalar fields have pressure - to - energy - density ratios ( `` equations of state '' ) ranging between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and their sound speeds are equal to the speed of light ; however , k - essence models relax both of these restrictions  @xcite .",
    "the second , more phenomenological , approach to dark energy is to parameterize its equation of state and sound speed as functions of time or scale factor .",
    "although an action is necessary for predicting the effects of dark energy across a range of energy and distance scales , a dark energy which does not cluster gravitationally and does not couple to any other particle can really only be constrained on cosmological scales , so such a parameterization is sufficient .",
    "here we adopt the commonly - used form  @xcite , @xmath12 and we assume a sound speed @xmath13 .",
    "this representation of @xmath14 smoothly parameterizes a large range of models including freezing and thawing scalar fields , phantom energy with @xmath15 , and early dark energy .",
    "one of its limitations is that constraints on early dark energy imply @xmath16 , limiting the rate at which @xmath14 can change at recent times  @xcite .",
    "however , since the data are not powerful enough to constrain a large number of dark energy parameters , this parameterization is a reasonable compromise , and is used in analyzing the results from many surveys .      over the past several years",
    ", higher - order cosmological perturbation theory has been crafted into a useful tool for understanding the growth of large - scale structure .",
    "applying the continuity and euler equations to an effective matter fluid with an irrotational velocity field , perturbation theory lets us predict the power spectrum of large - scale structure at early times and at moderately nonlinear scales .",
    "although the scale - dependent growth rate in massive neutrino models is incompatible with most perturbative methods , so - called `` time renormalization group '' ( time - rg ) perturbation theory accommodates massive neutrinos by directly integrating the evolution equations for the power spectrum  @xcite . in this work we extend the publicly available  perturbation theory code  @xcite to include massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy . in our perturbative treatment , as well as in our computation of the scale - dependent growth ,",
    "we treat neutrinos as a linear source for growth of cold dark matter and baryonic density perturbations .",
    "the regime of validity of perturbation theory can not be calculated rigorously , and at sufficiently small scales the fluid approximation breaks down  @xcite .",
    "currently the most reliable test of perturbation theory is a direct comparison with n - body simulations , which approximate dark matter as a collection of point particles , obtaining dynamical monte carlo solutions to the vlasov - poisson system of equations .",
    "such a comparison is given in ref .",
    "@xcite using a large range of perturbation theory methods for @xmath9cdm cosmologies , and quantifying the accuracy of each perturbative method . here",
    "we use n - body simulations to test time - rg and a few other perturbation theories , for models with dynamical dark energy and massive neutrinos , up to redshifts @xmath17 .    while n - body simulations are the accepted way to compute the nonlinear matter power spectrum of cold dark matter , including neutrinos in the simulation as particles is difficult because of their large thermal velocities , and artificial clustering induced by having multiple species of particles with very different particle masses .",
    "consequently , different groups have computed nonlinear corrections to the matter power spectrum due to massive neutrinos by adopting different approaches .",
    "perturbation theory was extended to the quasi - nonlinear regime by using standard second order perturbation theory in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors account for neutrinos in the initial conditions for the cdm particles in the simulations , and add the linearly evolved neutrino fluctuations to the particle fluctuations to obtain the total power spectrum , ignoring the nonlinear interaction of the neutrinos with the dark matter .",
    "an alternative approach to studying the effect of neutrinos at small scales by using the halo model is pursued in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "gravitational interactions between neutrinos and dark matter particles were self - consistently incorporated in ref .",
    "@xcite by including neutrino particles in n - body simulations with a thermal velocity sampled from the appropriate fermi - dirac distribution in addition to a flow velocity to set up initial conditions , typically starting the ( neutrino ) simulation at very late times so that the neutrino thermal velocity is relatively small  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this was to avoid difficulties of the sort encountered in ref .",
    "@xcite and in other earlier simulation efforts .    to extend the treatment further , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors propagate a linearly evolved neutrino perturbation on a grid , and cdm particles in an n - body simulation that evolves under the influence of self - gravity as well as the potential sourced by the neutrino fluid on the grid .",
    "further improvements to this method were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite where this approach was combined with a particle representation to study sub - mpc effects of neutrino clustering , and in ref .",
    "@xcite who also evolve the neutrino density in the nonlinear potentials sourced by the cdm particles .",
    "these nonlinear corrections show that the nonlinear matter power spectrum is suppressed to a maximum of @xmath18 ( as compared to @xmath19 found in linear theory mentioned earlier ) and the suppression decreases for wavenumbers larger than a certain value @xmath20 which depends on the neutrino mass .",
    "our goal is to calculate the power spectrum in the presence of _",
    "( i ) _ massive neutrinos and _ ( ii ) _ time - varying dark energy equations of state , only up to @xmath21 , allowing us to simplify the treatment of neutrinos considerably .",
    "we include these two new physical ingredients in both simulations and higher - order perturbation theory , finding that the two methods agree at the @xmath22 level up to @xmath23 at @xmath24 , and better at higher redshifts . through perturbative arguments",
    "we show that our simple approximation for neutrinos in the n - body simulations , following refs .",
    "@xcite , is valid at the @xmath25 level over the entire region of applicability of perturbation theory , justifying its use in our code .",
    "finally , we apply our perturbative calculations to determine the effect on the power spectrum of varying neutrino masses and the two dark energy equation of state parameters , finding , for example , that neutrino inhomogeneities have little effect on the bao scale .",
