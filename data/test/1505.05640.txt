    "since any experiment on a superfluid fermi gas is done in trap potential@xcite , it is interesting to explore physical phenomena originating from this spatial inhomogeneity .",

    "another example is the phase separation observed in a @xmath2li fermi gas with spin imbalance@xcite , where the spin - balanced superfluid region in the trap center is spatially surrounded by excess atoms .",
    "in addition to these macroscopic phenomena , the spatial inhomogeneity can also affect microscopic superfluid properties .",
    "noting that a trap potential breaks the spatial inversion symmetry when the inversion center is taken to be away from the trap center , we expect that the parity becomes no longer a good quantity to classify the spatial structure of a cooper pair , leading to the admixture of even and odd parity symmetry . since a pair wavefunction is always antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two fermions , this naturally leads to the mixing of spin - singlet and spin - triplet state . when this phenomenon occurs , the @xmath0-wave superfluid state is accompanied by a triplet cooper pair amplitude , in addition to the ordinary singlet component .",

    "actually , the system is still in the @xmath0-wave superfluid state , as far as the system only has an @xmath0-wave interaction .",
    "this is simply because the symmetry of a fermi superfluid is fully determined by the symmetry of the superfluid order parameter , which is essentially given by the product of a pairing interaction and a pair amplitude .",

    "this makes us expect that , when one can induce a @xmath1-wave pair amplitude in an @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas , a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas may be realized .",
    "this possibility has recently been discussed by one of the authors@xcite , where a @xmath1-wave pair amplitude is induced by a synthetic spin - orbit interaction@xcite .",
    "the present paper provides another source of @xmath1-wave pair amplitude , without using an artificial gauge field .",
    "the admixture of singlet and triplet cooper pairs has recently attracted much attention in the field of non - centrosymmetric superconductivity@xcite , where a crystal lattice with no inversion center causes this phenomenon . in this field , it has been pointed out that this admixture may be the origin of the anomalous temperature dependence of the penetration depth observed in li@xmath15pt@xmath16b@xcite .",

    ", the phase separation is known to occur@xcite , where the superfluid region in the trap center is surrounded by excess atoms .",
    "figure [ fig8](a ) shows this case . in this panel , since the spin imbalance is almost absent around the trap center , the triplet condensate fraction is suppressed there , compared to the case when the phase separation does not occur ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "in addition , the region around the edge of the gas cloud is highly spin polarized , so that the triplet pair amplitude is also suppressed there . as a result ,",
    "when the phase separation occurs , the triplet pair amplitude is localized around the edge of the gas cloud of the minority component ( @xmath181 ) , as shown in fig . [ fig8](b ) .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed the possibility of inducing a triplet pair amplitude in a trapped @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas . using symmetry considerations",
    ", we clarified that both the broken spatial inversion symmetry and a broken spin rotation symmetry are necessary for this phenomenon to occur .",
    "we numerically confirmed that a triplet pair amplitude is induced when this condition is satisfied , within the mean - field theory for a two - dimensional lattice model . in this confirmation , we considered the three cases with ( 1 ) trap - potential difference , ( 2 ) mass imbalance , and ( 3 ) spin imbalance . in the first case",
    ", we showed that the induced triplet pair amplitude is dominated by a @xmath1-wave symmetry . among the above three cases ,",
    "a trapped @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas with spin imbalance has been realized@xcite .",
    "thus , our results imply that a triplet pair amplitude is already present in this system , although there is no experimental evidence yet .    since the symmetry of a fermi superfluid is fully determined by the symmetry of the superfluid order parameter , the induction of a triplet pair amplitude does not immediately mean the realization of a triplet fermi superfluid .",
    "in the present case , the system is still in the @xmath0-wave superfluid state which is characterized by the @xmath0-wave superfluid order parameter , even in the presence of a triplet pair amplitude .",
    "under this situation , however , when one suddenly changes the @xmath0-wave pairing interaction to an appropriate @xmath1-wave one , the product of the @xmath1-wave interaction and the triplet pair amplitude that has been induced before this manipulation may immediately give a finite @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter . since the @xmath0-wave superfluid order parameter vanishes",
    ", by definition , we have a @xmath1-wave superfluid state , characterized by this @xmath1-wave superfluid parameter .",
    "the change of the interaction would be possible by using the feshbach resonance technique .    in cold fermi gas physics",
    ", although the realization of a @xmath1-wave superfluid state is a crucial challenge , current experiments are facing various difficulties originating from a @xmath1-wave interaction , such as three particle loss@xcite , as well as the dipolar relaxation@xcite . in this regard , the above idea may avoid these difficulties to some extent , because the triplet pair amplitude is prepared in an @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas with no @xmath1-wave interaction .",
    "in addition , since we can start from a finite value of the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter , the system would be in the @xmath1-wave superfluid state for a while , until it is strongly damaged by the particle loss and dipolar relaxation after the @xmath1-wave interaction is introduced . in this sense ,",
    "the induction of a triplet pair amplitude discussed in this paper is important , not only as a fundamental physical phenomenon , but also on the viewpoint of the challenge toward the realization of a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas .    in this paper , we have treated a lattice model to simply confirm the induction of a triplet pair amplitude . to quantitatively evaluate this quantity",
    ", we need to extend the present analyses to a realistic continuum fermi superfluid .",
    "to assess the idea that one produces a @xmath1-wave superfluid fermi gas from the induced triplet pair amplitude , it is also important to clarify the time evolution of the @xmath1-wave superfluid order parameter after the @xmath0-wave interaction is replaced by a @xmath1-wave one .",
