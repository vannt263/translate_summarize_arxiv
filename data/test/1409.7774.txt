    "cd@xmath1 t cell responses exert strong selection pressures on human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) as shown by evidence stemming from a variety of observations @xcite .",
    "the selective pressure exerted by these responses has been quantified from the growth rate advantage of viral mutants that escape cd@xmath1 t cell control @xcite .",
    "more recently , studies based on the analysis of the entire viral genome revealed escape in multiple epitopes targeted by cd@xmath1 t cell responses @xcite .",
    "a mathematical analysis of these data shows that late - emerging escape mutants outgrow the resident virus population more slowly than early escapes @xcite we refer to this pattern as _ escape rate decrease _ ( erd ) .",
    "erd has been assumed to have a biological basis , arising from either variation in @xcite or a decrease of fitness advantages of escape mutants during the course of infection @xcite .",
    "but it could also be due to complex dynamical interactions between escape mutations in different epitopes .",
    "the complexity arises from the fact that two similarly beneficial mutations rarely arise simultaneously on one genome .",
    "rather , they arise on different genomes which , after outcompeting the wild type strain , enter a state of competition .",
    "this state is eventually resolved by one mutation going to fixation by chance , or by one of the strains acquiring the other beneficial mutation . in this scenario ,",
    "the fixation of one of the advantageous mutations takes longer than its fitness advantage predicts . in population genetics , this complex dynamics",
    "is called _ interference _ @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : selective_interference ] shows how interference can affect the interpretation of erd in early hiv infection . describing the escape dynamics with models that reduce the dynamics to the competition between two types only  a wildtype and a single escape mutation  and neglect interference , misrepresents the selection pressures at work , and may lead to biased estimates of their strength .    in this study ,",
    "we investigated under which circumstances genetic interference arises and may thus lead to misinterpretation of pattern of escape rate changes in systems with two loci .",
    "to this end , we developed a virus dynamics model , in which viruses possess multiple epitopes and can escape from cd@xmath1 t cells directed against them .",
    "the model builds on well - established work @xcite , and is stochastic to describe mutation , extinction and fixation of virus strains adequately , and allows recombination of viruses .",
    "we found that interference emerges mainly when cd@xmath1 t cell responses coincide and are similarly strong , but only in systems with a high level of stochasticity .",
    "this interference leads to erd if the virus population was sampled more often early than late , a scheme commonly adopted in empirical studies @xcite .",
    "we tested these predictions in early - infection data from an hiv - positive patient obtained by henn et al .",
    "@xcite and subsequently reconstructed to haplotypes @xcite .",
    "here , we extend the model of althaus and de boer @xcite , which is in turn based on earlier work @xcite . in our model , a viral strain @xmath2 is assumed to present @xmath3 different viral epitopes to the hosts immune system .",
    "the strain is represented by a string of binary digits , where a 1 at the @xmath4 entry signifies the presence of an escape mutation in the @xmath4 epitope .",
    "a 0 at the same entry signifies no mutation , and the strains is recognized by epitope - specific immune responses @xmath5 .",
    "the model equations are :    @xmath6      we assume a compartment of @xmath7 target cells @xmath8 , which is replenished at rate @xmath9 and gets naturally depleted at a rate @xmath10 per cell .",
    "virions of type @xmath2 , @xmath11 , will infect target cells at a rate @xmath12 and produce infected cells ( @xmath13 ) , where @xmath14 is the maximum infection rate per day for a virus particle , and @xmath15 is the target cell density where the infection rate is half - maximal @xcite . viral load and productively infected cells of type @xmath2 ( @xmath16 ) are connected by @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 and @xmath16 are fast coupling .",
    "hence , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the net production rate per cell .",
    "target cells infected with strain @xmath2 ( @xmath20 ) die at rate @xmath21 and enter an eclipse phase at rate @xmath22 , after which they become productively infected .",
    "cells infected with strains @xmath23 are converted to cells infected with strain @xmath24 at rate @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath25 is the locus - wise product of the probabilities for an epitope in strain @xmath23 to be mutated into the corresponding epitope in strain @xmath24 .",
    "we distinguish between forward mutations and reverse mutations .",
    "forward mutations change a 0 allele into a 1 .",
    "reverse mutations do the opposite .",
    "an epitope is assumed to consist of about @xmath26 codons .",
    "the mutation rate is @xmath27 per bp per replication @xcite . for an escape epitope to emerge ,",
    "this amounts to a rate of @xmath28 per epitope per replication .",
    "the reverse mutation rate was set to @xmath29 per epitope per replication ( see _ electronic supplementary material ( esm ) _ ) .",
    "cells infected with strain @xmath2 can arise and be lost by recombination .",
    "both processes are assumed to occur at the same baseline recombination rate @xmath30 and to be proportional to the fraction of co - infected cells in the population @xmath31 , @xcite .",
    "we chose the baseline recombination rate @xmath30 to incorporate those rates which do not directly depend on the strain frequencies or types .",
    "the terms within brackets in the recombination term in equation ( 2 ) deal with probabilities that depend on the strain frequencies .",
    "the first sum encompasses recombination events that increase @xmath20 .",
    "all pairs @xmath32 that can recombine into @xmath2 , @xmath33 , are considered .",
    "each such pair @xmath32 coinfected a cell with probability @xmath34 , where @xmath35 . the probability of @xmath2 to be",
    "the recombinant offspring is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the hamming distance between two strains .",
    "infected cell numbers should remain unaltered by the action recombination , since recombination only reshuffles alleles .",
    "we account for this by using the weights @xmath38 .",
    "we defined @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is one if @xmath41 and zero otherwise ( see _ esm _ for details on @xmath42 ) .",
    "the second type of events that can decrease @xmath20 are those in which the strain @xmath2 can recombine with any other into a strain different from @xmath2 .",
    "pairs can be formed with all other strains , including itself with probability @xmath43 .",
    "such an event needs to be weighted with the probability that @xmath2 will yield offspring distinct to itself : @xmath44 .",
    "again , in order to keep infected cell numbers unaffected by recombination , the weight @xmath45 is factored in .",
    "the baseline recombination rate @xmath30 incorporates several rates and probabilities .",
    "these include the probability for co - packaging two parent strains correctly , the number of newly infected cells produced by a single infected cell , the template switching rate and an assumption about the average distance between escape mutations on the genome .",
    "we set @xmath46 for our simulations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : recombination ] ) .",
    "productively infected cells infected with a strain @xmath2 are generated at rate @xmath22 from the eclipsed population @xmath20 , and die with rate @xmath47 .",
    "the cd@xmath1 t cells specific to the epitope @xmath48 , @xmath49 , clear productively infected cells whose epitopes they recognize maximally at rate @xmath50 , with @xmath51 the michaelis - menten constants @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath52 are 1 if @xmath2 has a zero at its @xmath4 position , and zero otherwise .",
    "they thereby encode the recognition of non - escape epitopes by the cd@xmath1 t cells .      unlike previous models describing cd@xmath1 t cell escape @xcite , our model does not dynamically link the immune response to the level of viral antigen . in our model , @xmath5 is a numerically constructed fixed time course of the cd@xmath1 t cells of type @xmath48 , consistent with a program - type dynamics established for cd@xmath1 t cell responses against infections in mice @xcite .    in order to attain a descriptive cd@xmath1 t cell function we combined two exponential functions and a constant value .",
    "the default cd@xmath1 t cell - function starts growing from a single cell at time @xmath53 at a rate of @xmath54 per day @xcite , until it reaches an upper limit @xmath55 , which is 1.5 logs larger than the final level value @xmath56 : @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "we refer to transforming the system under consideration @xmath61 , with its variables @xmath62 into a system downsized by a factor @xmath63 , @xmath64 , with corresponding variables @xmath65 . under a deterministic framework ,",

    "the model presented here reproduces basic experimentally observed aspects of hiv / siv dynamics ( fig.[fig : time_course ] ) . in our model ,",
    "the initial growth of the virus has been gauged to @xmath67 per day in accordance with @xcite .",

    "this value is about one to two orders of magnitude below peak viremia , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "the virus can only go extinct due to stochastic effects in the beginning of infection .",
    "lastly , the model can also realistically reproduce the simultaneous emergence of distinct viral escape mutations , as well as the generation of double escape mutants by mutation or recombination .      in order to quantify the _ expressed interference _ between viral escape strains during infection",
    ", we used the population genetics measure of linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) . in our two - epitope system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ld_sel ] ) , the linkage disequilibrium is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the frequency of the wildtype , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the frequencies of single mutants and @xmath73 is the frequency of the double escape strain ( where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are strongly advantageous ) .    in general , the wildtype is first replaced by single mutants , which are then outcompeted by the double mutant ( fig .  [ fig : ld_sel ] ) @xcite .",
    "this dynamics is characterized by the duration of the intermediate phase of single mutant dominance and by the diversity in single mutants .",
    "a quantitative measure of expressed interference of the dynamics has to behave appropriately when duration and diversity change .",
    "firstly , the longer two single mutants coexist , the higher the value of expressed interference should be ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ld_explan_1 ] ) .",
    "second , the higher the diversity during the state of stasis , the higher the interference measure should be ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ld_explan_2 ] ) .",
    "cumulative ld satisfies both of these conditions .",
    "the term _ cumulative _ refers to the integral of the ld over time .",
    "this measure is also well - behaved in standard population genetics models ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ld_explan_3 ] ) .",
    "negative values of the cumulative ld specifically characterize interference in a regime where selection is much stronger than recombination , and not other types of dynamics .",
    "dynamics in which escape mutations sequentially fixate , are characterized by zero ld .      in our model , we considered two cd@xmath1 t cell responses , each recognizing one of two epitopes .",
    "we investigated how differences in the strength and time delay ( see _ materials and methods _ ) of cd@xmath1 t cell functions affect the hiv dynamics .",
    "each cd@xmath1 t cell time course could assume two different values for its strength : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the order of elicitation .",
    "the first response was set to start at @xmath53 , and the second started with a delay of 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , or 30 days .",
    "each combination of cd@xmath1 t cell function pairs was simulated 100 times .",
    "we consider two levels of stochasticity here : a low and a high level ( see _ materials and methods _ ) .",
    "the low level is displayed in our simulations at census population size of about @xmath78 at set point with parameters as in table  [ table : par ] .",
    "the high level of stochasticity arises when we scale the population sizes by a factor @xmath79 ( see _ esm _ ) , consistent with empirical estimates of hiv s effective population size @xcite .      to investigate under which circumstances interference between escape mutation",
    "arises we calculated the cumulative ld for different combinations of strength and timing of cd@xmath1 t cell responses , and levels of stochasticity . for the unscaled system with low stochasticity",
    ", simulations showed positive cumulative ld , indicating the immediate emergence of double escapes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ld_s1 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , figures [ fig : ld_s-4]a - d show negative values of cumulative ld for the down - scaled system with high stochasticity , indicating interference .",
    "interference is particularly likely to occur when cd@xmath1 t cell responses are nearly synchronous and nearly equally strong .",
    "the reasons for the general pattern of negative cumulative ld are intuitively clear .",
    "first , synchronous ( time delay zero ) , but unequally powerful cd@xmath1 t cell functions favor one of the single escape strains , leading to its fast fixation ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ld_s-4 ] a and d ) .",
    "this dynamics of sequential escape produces no substantial cumulative ld , and no interference .",
    "second , cd@xmath1 t cell responses that are elicited far apart in time induce practically no interaction between haplotypes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ld_s-4 ] b and c ) .",
    "the earlier immune response will select for a first escape mutant , and the second elicited immune response will select for the double escape mutant .",
    "again , the escape dynamics is sequential , which leaves no trace in the cumulative ld .",
    "third , higher selective pressures ( higher @xmath56 s ) will decrease the time of emergence as well as the fixation time of double mutants .",
    "the coexistence time of single mutants will thereby be reduced .",
    "therefore the cumulative ld , which scales roughly as the coexistence time , will be smaller compared to lower selective pressures ( figures [ fig : ld_s-4 ] b and c ) .",
    "there is one exception to the general pattern : when the first immune response is stronger than the second @xmath80 , and precedes it by 5 days , substantial amounts of negative cumulative ld are generated .",
    "this result arises through the complex interplay between the timing and strength of the two responses in this scenario . with a delay of 5 days ,",
    "the total population of productively infected cells is at a local minimum at about the time when the action of the second response is at its peak . due to the contracting dynamics of the cd@xmath1 t cell responses ,",
    "the second response is stronger than the first at that time point , even for @xmath80 .",
    "the difference between the responses at that time point is small enough to allow for the emergence of interference .      for each simulation",

    "@xmath82 from the frequency of both escape mutations ( disregarding their linkage ) , mimicking experimental procedures as in @xcite ( see _ esm _ ) .",
    "the estimated escape rates were in good accordance with common values for escape rates during early infection .",
    "for example , escape rates at high interference conditions ( figure [ fig : ld_s-4]c ) were about @xmath83 in the median , @xmath84 for the 2.5%-quantile and @xmath85 for the 97.5%-quantile .    with the values @xmath81 and @xmath82 for each escape mutation",
    ", we calculated the successive escape rate decrease in each simulation .",
    "this was done by fitting a linear regression @xmath86 , as in @xcite .",
    "the slope of the regression @xmath87 is termed _ escape rate decrease value _",
    "( erd value ) .",
    "negative erd values indicate that later escapes are slower .    for small time delays , the erd values are between -0.01 and 0 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : slope_s-4 ] ) . in @xcite ,",
    "erd values inferred from escapes with @xmath81 within the first two years , are about @xmath88 in patient ch44 , @xmath89 in patient ch77 and @xmath90 in patient ch58 ( based on data in supplementary material of @xcite ) .      to investigate the effects of interference on the erd values we focused on those time delays shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ld_s-4 ] that showed substantial interference .",
    "figure [ fig : main_result ] shows the association between cumulative ld and erd values in 1000 simulations run for cd@xmath1 t cell functions with equal final levels @xmath91 and no time delay . in the plot , simulations which lead to a positive cumulative ld have been removed in order to assess the effects of interference only .",
    "the density distribution shows a clustering of simulation results along a line of positive slope .",
    "the distribution is compressed along that line .",
    "a theil - sen estimator fit to the data ( red line ) yields a slope of @xmath92 with confidence intervals @xmath93 for the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles , respectively .",
    "this indicates an association of interference and erd . the pattern shown in fig.[fig : main_result ]",
    "can also be identified in the other case with identical cd@xmath1 t cell final levels ( @xmath94 ) with no time delay ( see fig .",

    "we considered other combinations of final levels and time delays with median cumulative ld below minus one in the down - scaled system . as time delays increase , in simulations with cd@xmath1 t cell responses of equal strength",
    "we observe the appearance of a density peak alongside the interference , centered at about zero ld and negative erd values .",
    "this peak indicates the appearance of a different mode of escapes .",
    "these escapes are sequential and show no interference .",
    "as expected , this second mode eventually replaces the interference pattern as the time delay increases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : six_results ] ) .      to investigate one possible instance of interference and its effects on escape rates , we analyzed haplotype data obtained by deep sequencing in henn et al .",

    "this analysis supports the notion that interference was acting to delay the emergence of escapes and to reduce their escape rates .",
    "in this paper , the main focus was the interference of viral strains and its role in the escape dynamics .",
    "we identified signals of interference under very specific conditions : in systems with high levels of stochasticity and highly synchronized and comparably strong cd@xmath1 t cell responses , the generation of interference is facilitated .",
    "these conditions are often satisfied in experimental observations of hiv dynamics @xcite furthermore , when sampling at times typical for experimental studies , increasing interference decreases erd values .",
    "lastly , we also tested these predictions in one instance of two equally strong ctl responses elicited againts hiv in a patient @xcite . in the data a signal for interference was accompanied by erd .",
    "we restricted the simulations to two - locus systems , while erd was inferred from experimental data involving more escape variants .",
    "our results are consistent with theoretical findings for two - locus systems in the context of population genetics @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the principle that under interference the fast escape of one allele implies the slow escape of competing alleles with similar fitness should also hold in systems with more than two loci .",
    "we thus hypothesize that the pattern of erd is preserved in hiv dynamics models with more than two epitopes showing interference .",
    "furthermore , we ignored potential fitness costs of escape mutations in our simulations . they can be safely neglected if they are compensated at faster rates than the fixation times of beneficial mutants .",
    "only if fitness costs differ substantially between escape mutants do we expect that their explicit consideration will alter the role of interference .",
    "these results have to be interpreted in the larger context of estimating the selective pressures that immune responses exert on the virus population .",
    "these selection pressures are often inferred from the growth advantage of mutants that escaped the immune response  the rate of escape . estimating these rates of escape using models that neglect the complex genetical interactions between escape strains has revealed the pattern of erd central to our study .",
    "our study shows that caution is warranted when drawing conclusions from this pattern about the selection pressures at work .",
