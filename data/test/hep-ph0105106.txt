    "future @xmath8 colliders will likely have the option of operating in @xmath9 or @xmath10 collision modes  @xcite .",
    "these modes are reached by compton scattering laser light off one or more of the incoming fermion beams , and then colliding the resulting high energy photons with the remaining fermion beam or with each other .",
    "there is a large potential for @xmath11 and @xmath12 collisions to elucidate possible physics beyond the standard model ; previous investigations have focused on anomalous couplings  @xcite , searches for extra dimensions  @xcite , properties of supersymmetry  @xcite , and a broad host of other topics .",
    "one subject that deserves further study is @xmath3-violating gauge boson self - couplings .",
    "@xmath3 violation is one of the most poorly understood aspects of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "present data merely fixes the value of the @xmath3 violating phase in the ckm matrix , and can not test if this phase constitutes the only source for @xmath3 violation .",
    "in fact , studies of baryogenesis within the sm suggest that additional @xmath3 violating terms are required in order to generate the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe  @xcite",
    ". most discussions of @xmath3 violation at photon colliders work within the context of models such as supersymmetry , and focus upon either higgs or top quark production  @xcite .",
    "however , since almost every extension of the sm contains new @xmath3 violating phases , it is desirable to eliminate any possible theoretical bias by studying @xmath3 violation within the generic context of an effective lagrangian approach , without assuming any underlying mechanisms .",
    "a handful of such works have been performed in the past  @xcite , concentrating on @xmath13 , @xmath14 , or top quark production . here , we extend these studies by examining possible @xmath3 violating quartic gauge boson couplings .",
    "@xmath12 colliders are particularly suited to studying such couplings ; they can be probed in @xmath5 scattering processes , unlike at @xmath8 colliders .",
    "the sm contributions to the processes @xmath0 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , including electroweak contributions , were first computed in  @xcite .",
    "recently , they have been reexamined  @xcite , and shown to exhibit several interesting features that motivate our analysis .",
    "the sm amplitudes vanish at tree level , and may therefore be quite sensitive to the effects of new physics . at one loop",
    "they acquire large imaginary parts , completely dominated at high energies by the helicity amplitudes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the direction of transverse polarization relative to the beam direction .",
    "such amplitudes can interfere strongly with @xmath3 violating contributions from new sources , yielding greatly enhanced sensitivity to these new effects .",
    "in addition , the ability to polarize both the initial laser light and fermion beams allows the construction of observables which are sensitive only to these interference effects .",
    "these properties , together with the experimental cleanliness of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 scattering , suggest that these processes might provide powerful tools in searches for new physics .",
    "in this paper we will show that @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 at a photon collider can provide sensitive tests of @xmath3 violation in the gauge boson sector .",
    "we limit our study to genuinely quartic gauge boson operators , as contributions to the two point functions are strongly excluded by current data and the three point functions are likely better tested elsewhere .",
    "we consider manifestly su(2 ) @xmath4 u(1 ) invariant operators constructed from the appropriate field strength tensors , making no assumptions as to the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking . as a result ,",
    "our operators are of dimension eight . throughout the paper we will identify features of our analysis that might be useful for other new physics searches using these processes .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the density matrix formalism for photon - photon collisions in some detail , both for completeness and to motivate the expression for the ensemble average of the scattering amplitude , which will be used throughout our analysis .",
    "we then briefly discuss the construction of the anomalous @xmath3 violating operators we have studied .",
    "our results for the three processes considered are presented next , including discussions of the various initial laser and fermion beam polarizations .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions , including a comparison of our resulting sensitivity to these effects with others in the literature .",
    "in this section we present the density matrix formalism for photon - photon collisions .",
    "our discussion is similar to that found in the literature ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) , but is included here to provide motivation for eq .",
    "( 9 ) , which is used throughout our analysis .",
    "consider a photon moving along the @xmath22 axis ; its polarization vectors for positive and negative helicities are given by @xmath23 we will denote the photons corresponding to states with these polarizations by @xmath24 .",
    "the most general photon state can be written in this basis as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "writing this state in 4-vector form demonstrates that the choices @xmath28 and @xmath29 lead to circularly polarized states , while @xmath30 leads to a linearly polarized state .",
    "the angle @xmath31 describes the direction of linear polarization in the @xmath32 plane .",
    "the experimental setup in @xmath9 colliders has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite ; briefly , one compton scatters laser photons off fermion beams , and then collides the backscattered photons .",
    "when observing the scattering process @xmath33 , the energies or helicities of the incoming photons are not known ; they will be statistically distributed , with the specific distribution being determined by the details of the compton scattering process .",
    "when measuring the differential cross section , one no longer determines @xmath34 , but rather the ensemble average of @xmath35 : @xmath36 where the sum over @xmath37 sums over all possible initial states weighted by @xmath38 , the probability of their occurrence .",
    "we can write this in the form @xmath39 where we have introduced the density matrix for the incoming photons in the basis defined by @xmath40 : @xmath41 let us compute the density matrix for the laser photon of eq .",
    "( 2 ) ; introducing the notation @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 measure the amounts of circular and linear polarization , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the polarizations for the values @xmath47 and @xmath30 noted before .",
    "after the compton scattering process , the degrees of linear and circular polarization are described by distributions which are dependent upon the fraction of the fermion beam energy the laser photons acquire . denoting this fraction by @xmath48 , and the helicity distribution functions by @xmath49 ,",
    "the density matrix becomes @xmath50 the eigenvalues of this matrix are @xmath51 we no longer have a pure state unless @xmath52 .",
    "as the processes considered in this paper involve two compton scattered photons , the complete density matrix will be the tensor product of the density matrix for each photon . also , since one of the initial laser photons",
    "will be moving along the @xmath53 axis , we must take @xmath54 in its density matrix . referring back to eqs .",

    "the physical cross section involves a convolution of this scattering amplitude with the photon number density function of each photon .",
    "the explicit form of this function , as well as the forms for the linear and circular helicity distribution functions , can be found in the appendix .",
    "here we construct the most general set of operators that contribute to neutral gauge boson self - interactions , subject to the following constraints .",

    "we also make no assumption as to the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . these restrictions lead us to the following set of seven dimension eight operators constructed from the @xmath7 and @xmath60 field strength tensors : @xmath61 here",
    "@xmath62 is the su(2 ) field strength tensor and @xmath63 the u(1 ) field strength tensor .",
    "we have introduced the notation @xmath64 and our convention for the @xmath65 tensor is @xmath66 .",

    "operators such as @xmath68 , where the @xmath67 tensor contracts an index on each field strength tensor , are reducible to those where the @xmath67 tensor fully contracts one of the field strength tensors through use of the schouten identity ( see the first reference in  @xcite ,  @xcite ) , @xmath69 which states that no tensor antisymmetric in five indices exists in four dimensions .",
    "similarly , the operators @xmath70 can be reduced to those listed in eq .",
    "( 10 ) through use of the identity @xmath71 this is true for @xmath72 antisymmetric in four - dimensional spaces ( an analog holds in arbitrary dimensions  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , since the processes considered here only involve @xmath73 , the operators @xmath74 become equivalent to the second operator in eq .",
    "( 10 ) through use of the above identity , while the operators @xmath75 only contribute to processes involving @xmath76 .",

    "however , a determination of @xmath113 requires several separate measurements , and it is certainly not expected that colliders will operate primarily with purely linearly polarized beams , or even primarily in a photon collision mode .",

    "however , those operators for which the asymmetry does not vanish can still be constrained quite stringently .    in conclusion",
    ", the sensitivity of @xmath212 to interference with the large sm amplitude @xmath17 renders this process a sensitive probe of @xmath3 violation appearing in gauge boson self couplings .",
    "in this paper we have examined the possibility of using the processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 to search for sources of @xmath3 violation that manifest themselves at energy scales above those of future colliders .",
    "we have parameterized these effects by an effective lagrangian containing the complete and independent set of @xmath3-odd , su(2 ) @xmath4 u(1 ) invariant quartic gauge boson operators relevant to these interactions .",

    "our results show that they are also of utility in searches for sources of @xmath3 violation that contribute to self interactions of gauge bosons .    to demonstrate that these processes are indeed sensitive probes of the gauge boson sector",
    ", we compare our results with four others found in the literature .",
    "we first note that while our operators are of dimension eight , those with which we compare are of dimension six .",
    "although our comparisons are for the search reaches for the new physics scale @xmath213 , the reader should be aware that a given limit on @xmath213 translates into a greater sensitivity to a dimension eight operator , which scales as @xmath214 , than a dimension six operator , which scales as @xmath215 , for @xmath216 .",
    "we also note that the constraints on the anomalous su(2 ) @xmath4 u(1 ) operators obtained in this paper are stronger than those implied by unitarity .",
    "we first contrast our search reaches with the direct bounds on quartic gauge boson couplings given recently by the lep experiments  @xcite .",
    "they consider operators of the form @xmath217 , and obtain bounds of @xmath218 on @xmath3-conserving @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 vertices .",
    "the operators considered in this paper are of the form @xmath222 ( with @xmath120 ) , and therefore our search reach for @xmath223 are to be contrasted with their bounds on @xmath224 .",
    "as expected , our sensitivity at a higher energy and higher luminosity collider are very significantly better .",
    "we next compare our results with those of a study of these same operators at a @xmath225 gev @xmath124 collider with an integrated luminosity of @xmath226  @xcite . in this study the operators are parameterized in the form @xmath227 , and bounds of @xmath228 obtained on vertices such as the @xmath229 vertex . setting @xmath230 , this results in @xmath231 gev , at the @xmath232 level .",
    "the sensitivities obtained in this paper , normalized to the appropriate luminosity and energy are @xmath233 gev , where the better constraints are for those operators contributing to one of the considered asymmetries .",
    "the search reaches obtained here on @xmath213 , after adjusting the statistical significances , are still stronger , even though the operators we consider are of dimension eight .",
    "the sensitivity of future hadron colliders such as the lhc to these anomalous @xmath3-even @xmath79 and @xmath234 has been studied in  @xcite .",
    "this paper obtains search reaches of @xmath235 at the 95 % cl , which are again somewhat weaker than those we have presented .",
    "finally , the authors of  @xcite consider @xmath3-odd dimension six operators contributing to the process @xmath236 at @xmath237 tev assuming @xmath238 of integrated luminosity .",
    "they cast their operators in the form @xmath239 , and obtain bounds of @xmath240 .",
    "note the we have improved their results by a factor of 2.5 to simulate the search reach assuming @xmath241 of integrated luminosity .",
    "these translate into limits of @xmath242 gev in our notation , at the @xmath243 level . the relevant limits in this paper to compare to are those assuming @xmath241 of integrated luminosity , which range from @xmath244 gev to @xmath245 gev at the 95 % cl .",
    "our constraints on the new physics scale @xmath213 are not quite as strong , which is not too surprising considering the large cross section for @xmath236 and the fact that their operators are of dimension six while ours are of dimension eight , although the differences are lessened after accounting for the greater statistical significance of our results .",
    "however , the processes considered are complementary ; they study the charged gauge boson production process @xmath236 while we examine the neutral gauge boson processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .    in summary ,",
    "the processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are sensitive probes of @xmath3 violation in the gauge boson sector .",
    "the sensitivities obtained here to the anomalous @xmath3-odd operators affecting these interactions compare favorably with similar limits on anomalous gauge boson couplings found in the literature .",
    "in addition , the examination of these processes nicely complements previous studies that have focused primarily on @xmath7 boson , top quark , or higgs production .",
    "their utility in other indirect physics searches at future photon colliders should certainly be studied in more detail .",
