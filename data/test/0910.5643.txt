    "various approaches inspired by physics have been proposed to deal with the routing problem in massively dense wireless sensor networks . starting with the pioneering work of jacquet ( see  @xcite ) who used ideas from geometrical optics to deal with the case of one source and one destination and a distribution of relay nodes .",
    "approaches based on electrostatics have been studied in @xcite ( see the survey  @xcite and references therein ) to deal with the case of a distribution of sources and destinations with a density of relay nodes in a static environment .",
    "the development of the theory of routing in massively dense wireless sensor networks has emerged in a complete independent way of the theory developed within the community of road traffic engineers , introduced in 1952 by wardrop  @xcite and beckmann  @xcite , see also  ( * ? ? ? * , footnote 3 ) for the abundant literature of the early 50 s , and which is still an active research area among that community , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "only very recently , new approaches based on road traffic theory have been studied in  @xcite defining the wardrop equilibrium and a characterization of the wardrop equilibrium in this type of setting and including a geometrical characterization of the flow of information for some particular cost functions .",
    "consider that a spatially distributed set of mobile sources is creating data that must be delivered to a spatially distributed set of mobile destinations . in this context ,",
    "our objective is to study the optimal traffic distribution and to find the minimum amount of relay nodes needed to transport the data from the sources to the destinations .",
    "the main contribution of this work is to address this problem for a mobile context where we analyze the cases where ( i ) only sources are mobile and the destinations are static as it would be in the case when the aggregation centers are fixed and the sensor nodes have the capability to move , ( ii ) the case when both sources and destinations are mobile , and given that the mathematics involve are similar ( iii ) we also analyze the case when the sources are static and the destinations are mobiles .    in section  [ one ]",
    "we first analyze the case where the sources and destinations are static and spatially distributed in the one dimensional line in order to illustrate the behavior of the flow function and the optimal location of the relay nodes on this simple case .",
    "we analyze in section  [ two ] the case when the sources and destinations are static and spatially distributed in the two dimensional plane . in section  [ movement ]",
    "we analyze the case where the sources and destinations can move with a deterministic velocity and we are able to find the optimal flow of information and to give the optimal spatial density of the relay nodes at each period of time . within this section",
    "we also give an example with numerical results related to the previous mobility setting . in section  [ brownian ]",

    "notice that the minimization problem we solved does not really consider the interaction on time because the problem describes the movement of sources and destinations nodes in the space and then we solve the static problem at each time .",
    "the problem solved at each time may not be optimal in the whole period of time considered .",
