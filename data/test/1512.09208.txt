    "the unsharp masked image indicates that the n - complex is the tip of a large curved structure connected to the hourglass region ( figure [ fig : unsharp ] ) .",

    "the opening angle of the se - bubble and the nw - bubble is @xmath170@xmath2890@xmath28 ( figures [ fig : unsharp ] and [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the western side of the h@xmath0 nebula is much brighter and has a more complex structure than the eastern side .",
    "in particular , the w - filament and its surroundings have a rich structure consisting of many filaments and blobs .",

    "the s - filaments are well traced by the uv emission .",
    "there also are faint uv counterparts for the sw - filaments . because these filaments have either a weak or no spatial correlation with the x - ray emission , we consider that the s- and sw - filaments are not closely related to the starburst winds .",

    "the uv emission associated with the optical filaments may partly be the precursor emission of a shock within the nebula .",

    "the ages of the three regions are thus @xmath18 myr , @xmath124 myr , and @xmath184 myr , for the butterfly nebula , the hourglass region , and the outer filaments , respectively .",

    "then the duration of the superwind @xmath156 is calculated by @xmath157 , leading to @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the total mass of the wind including the loaded mass .",

    "@xcite noted that the discrepancy between the above two values arises from the difference in the star formation histories they used ; @xcite assumed a constant star formation history over 20 myr , whereas @xcite adopted a merger - induced increasing star formation scenario .",
    "the morphology of the h@xmath0 nebula suggests an intermittent star formation nature for the star - forming history of ngc  6240 .",
    "in particular , the estimated age of the butterfly nebula is much shorter than the duration of the star formation assumed by @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt a sfr of 25 @xmath7  yr@xmath3 for the butterfly nebula .",
    "the age of the hourglass region estimated above ( @xmath124 myr ) is almost consistent with the starburst age ( @xmath11525 myr ) estimated by @xcite .",
    "we thus interpret that the hourglass region was created by this starburst , and its sfr was 25 @xmath7  yr@xmath3 , which is the value estimated by @xcite from the central red stellar population .",

    "the duration of the superwind is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the age of each region .",
    "this suggests that the starburst / superwind activity has an intermittent nature as suggested by numerical simulations of galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the duration of the superwind for the hourglass region ( 4 myr ) is consistent with the starburst duration ( @xmath15 myr ) estimated by @xcite .    in the above discussion , we ignored the agn contribution to the wind evolution . currently , there are double active nuclei at the center of ngc  6240 and they play a non negligible role in energetics in the central region of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the agns are , however , deeply embedded and still not active enough to form the extended hot and warm gas nebula surrounding the galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus the most part of the nebula was probably formed by the starburst activity @xcite . even in the vicinity of the nuclei ,",
    "the influence of the agns to the surrounding excited gas region has not been clear yet @xcite .",

    ", the ism in the merging system might be more abundant in the northwestern and western sides of the merging galaxies than in the eastern and southeastern sides . a combination of the intermittent nature of the starburst activity and the lopsided ism distribution formed a rich structure of loops , filaments , or blobs in the western side of the system .",
    "the extended active star formation as indicated by the uv images was also preferentially induced in the western side as the wind propagated outward from the central starburst .",
    "the bright knots observed in the western side of the system were probably formed by collisions between the high - speed outflowing gas from the center and dense gas blobs .",
    "the ram pressure of the outflow served to highly condense the gas blobs and initiated active star formation .",
    "approximately 20 myr ago , a short duration starburst ( @xmath145 myr ) occurred at the center of the system .",
    "this starburst and the subsequent superwind formed the central stellar population of ngc  6240 and the hourglass region of the h@xmath0 nebula .",
    "active star formation ceased temporarily following the short duration burst described above .",
    "several myr ago , the concentration of gas by the continuing approach of the two nuclei induced an intense starburst that continues to the present ; and also drove agn activity .",

    "the 6,000-sec suprime - cam observation was the first to reveal the detailed structure of a highly - extended h@xmath0 emitting nebula ( the h@xmath0 nebula ) whose size reaches to @xmath190 kpc in diameter .",
    "this nebula was probably formed by large - scale energetic outflows  or superwinds  driven by starburst events induced by a galaxy  galaxy merger .",
    "in addition to the butterfly - shaped inner nebula , which has already been investigated by various authors , the outer nebula has a complex structure consisting of wiggled narrow filaments , loops , bubbles , and blobs .",
    "we found a huge bi - polar bubble ( the se - bubble plus the nw - bubble ) , which extends along the minor axis of the main stellar disk of ngc  6240 . the total h@xmath0 luminosity is @xmath101.6 @xmath20 10@xmath43 erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "we estimated the volume filling factor @xmath97 of the h@xmath0 nebula assuming a simple thermal pressure equilibrium and a ram pressure balance between the warm ionized gas and the soft x - ray gas .",
    "the @xmath97 is of orders 10@xmath410@xmath5 for the both cases .",
    "we calculated the mass of the h@xmath0 emitting gas to be @xmath95 of @xmath15 @xmath168 @xmath7 using the @xmath97 .",
    "it is remarkable that the h@xmath0 extent and morphology are quite similar to the x - ray ( 0.71.1 kev ) emitting hot gas detected with a deep _ chandra _ observation @xcite .",
    "such a close spatial coincidence between the optical emission line nebula and the hot gas is generally observed in starburst superwinds .",
    "this strongly suggests that the same physical mechanism , shock - heating , plays an important role in the excitation of both phases of the gas at the outer regions of the h@xmath0 nebula .",
    "the h@xmath0 nebula also has a close spatial correlation with the uv emission in the western region of the galaxy .",
    "some bright star - forming knots are located in the western region .",
    "these facts suggest , therefore , that star - forming activity was induced by the interaction of the outflow and the ism , and that the interaction was probably enhanced due to a lopsided gas distribution formed by the merger .",
    "the morphology and surface brightness distribution of the h@xmath0 nebula suggest that there were probably three major episodes of starburst / superwind activities that formed the nebula .",
    "the most extended part of the nebula was initiated @xmath180 myr ago .",
    "multiple intermittent starbursts in this era created many outflow filaments and clouds extending @xmath140 kpc out from the center . at the same time , the outflowing gas interacted with the ism and induced extended star formation in the main stellar disk .",
    "an intense short duration starburst then occurred @xmath120 myr ago , forming the hourglass region of the h@xmath0 nebula .",
