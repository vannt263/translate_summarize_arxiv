    "understanding why and how visual representations work is an important issue addressed in many works on information visualization @xcite@xcite . on the track of this issue , in this work , we assume that well - designed visualizations must stimulate visual and cognitive processes in a way that reasoning is amplified .",
    "the effective promotion of such reasoning depends on principles mastered in the sciences of vision and cognition : vision is the gate through which information derived from computer graphics reaches the brain ; cognition refers to the processing that is induced by such graphics .",
    "vision and cognition are closely intertwined , a fact to be considered in the design of visualizations .",
    "accordingly , understanding information visualization ( infovis for short ) in light of these sciences may improve design principles that , usually , are performed intuitively . to this end , we review the steps that take place during vision - cognition phenomena when the goal is data analysis . in survey fashion , we compile the literature introducing the following contributions :    * theoretical compendium : we draw a descriptive relationship between vision , cognition , and information visualization ; * discussions : we debate our rationalizations over extensive literature ; * reflections : we provide study cases to revisit design practices .",
    "we organize visualization concepts aiming at the needs pointed out by @xcite , who recommend the characterization of how and why visualizations work , and by @xcite , who stress the importance of the cognitive aspects underlying visualizations .",
    "furthermore , we review principles for visual representations that , according to @xcite , are an initial step towards more effective visualization techniques , a demand defended by @xcite .",
    "we note that , while we build an association between information visualization , vision , and cognitive sciences , we do not reach a definitive settlement .",
    "this is because neither vision nor cognition are yet fully understood .",
    "rather , constrained to the current state of the art , we introduce an organizational process that discusses use and design .",
    "the literature presents several models that lay the basis to information visualization .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of deriving visual structures from a set of fundamental components .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite , conducted studies on the usefulness of visual patterns in the form of frameworks for design . @xcite",
    "follow bertin by discussing the importance of the spatial substrate .",
    "@xcite suggests a taxonomical space for quick referencing ; @xcite reasons about the possibilities of visualization and interaction ; and @xcite focuses on data transformations . in the realm of design ,",
    "@xcite deals with spatial and abstract visualizations considering the design guidelines of @xcite . in the line of works that reflect about the visualization field",
    ", @xcite systematically discusses visualizations based on a cost - oriented analysis ; and @xcite research many cognitive and perceptual aspects @xcite to build a model and a set of guidelines for design .",
    "@xcite introduces a framework based on vision and cognition sciences , similar to ours , focusing on top - down processes .",
    "comparatively , we conduct a complementary bottom - up approach ; we translate vision - cognition phenomena into an original vocabulary that may bring such science closer to the design practice .    to organize our compilation on vision and cognitive sciences , we depart from the visualization pipeline of @xcite to draw the visual expression process , a sequence of events delineated by the possibilities of the visual - cognitive interplay .",
    "according to our organization , ( 1 ) vision phenomena ( pre - attentive stimuli ) determines a map of potential interesting objects .",
    "then , attentive selection concentrates on one single element , part of a set of ( 2 ) analytical perceptions . such perceptions go through a pattern - matching process that turns them into ( 3 ) abstract patterns that , in working memory , support cognition in combination with domain knowledge originated from long - term memory .",
    "finally , leading to ( 4 ) cognitive decision support .",
    "nevertheless , our process does not explain the intercourse between vision , cognition , and information visualization ; this is not feasible considering the current knowledge , and neither it would fit in a single article .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : vision_and_visualization ] draws a detailed panorama of vision and cognition in the realm of information visualization .",
    "section [ sec : visual_expressivity ] introduces the visual expression process , our organizational theorization ; and the last section presents conclusive remarks .",
    "according to vision science , the visual process has two stages , namely , the parallel extraction of low - level properties , called _ pre - attentive processing _ , followed by a slower _ detailed scan_. the first stage promotes the major benefit of visualizations , that is , improved data comprehension @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , the second stage addresses conventional reading practices that do not contribute towards faster cognition , but that are necessary for further analysis . in fact , @xcite states that understanding what is processed pre - attentively is probably the most important contribution that vision science can bring to visualization",
    ".    this two - stage process might be the underlying motivation for the broadly referenced `` visualization mantra '' : overview first , zoom and filter , then details on demand @xcite  schneiderman came to this conclusion by means of intuition and empirical experiments , never drawing the vision / cognitive reasons of why this is the case .",
    "we discuss this process in the following sections according to our process , presented in section [ sec : visual_expressivity ] .      in the early stages of vision , the brain deals with the problem of casting potential elements of interest ; regions of the scene that should be considered for cognition . to cope with that",
    ", a complex process takes place so that certain characteristics pop out to the eyes .",
    "these characteristics appear as saliences over the scene .",
    "they define the so - called _ maps of saliences _ , exemplified in figure [ fig : saliency_map ] ; the first element of our theoretical organization .",
    "the principle of salience is to reinforce the perception of the areas in the scene whose visual properties contrast with those of their surroundings @xcite .",
    "it is a process that considers different visual aspects , such as position and color , and that ends as it combines them onto a single scene @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of salient features stems from their interplay with other stimuli , depending on a context that favors conspicuousness .",
    "the brain is highly trained to detect such configurations , being able to track salient features in parallel , in real - time , and covering the entire visual field .",
    "there is also evidence that this ability is strongly influenced by the task - at - hand , in a top - down ( cognition - to - vision ) process @xcite @xcite .",
    "although the brain perceives visual targets simultaneously in a map of saliences , it can not process all of them in parallel .",
    "this is considered a prohibitively computational task even to the most sophisticated brains @xcite . primates and other animals handle this by restricting the consideration of the objects presented to their eyes : their vision concentrates on small regions considering objects one after the other .",
    "this is a serialization process ruled by what is called _ attention_. in other words , once a map of candidates is ready , it is necessary to `` filter out '' one of these candidates for attention .",
    "attention , here , occurs in accordance with the task that the user is performing ; the task determines the information demands and , consequently , what visual stimuli should be extracted from the scene .",
    "trial and error is part of the process , which is iterative .",
    "this process of filtering has been modeled as a pyramidal neuronal structure  named _ selective tuning _ model @xcite @xcite .",
    "this theoretical model predicts a broad layer of neurons in its first level , narrowing down as it advances to upper layers .",
    "the layers intercommunicate through feed - forward and feedback connections and , according to @xcite @xcite , a pyramid of neurons successively performs three stages of processing , illustrated in figure [ fig : attentive_selection ] : ( a ) bottom - up feed - forward , ( b ) top - down winner - take - all feedback @xcite , and ( c ) bottom - up straight path .",
    "this process explains what is broadly referenced as _",
    "filtering _ or _",
    "attentive selection_.    following this widely - accepted model , it is worthy to note that , as described , filtering occurs according to both bottom - up and top - down processes .",
    "the bottom - up process depends on the visual stimuli , while the top - down process depends on the task at hand and is prioritized @xcite .",
    "each process influences the other iteratively . actually , according to @xcite , the entire visual - cognition interplay in influenced by top - down mechanisms that emanate from working memory , but that may be highly influenced by long - term memory @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the bottom - up process , but there are works that explore higher - level factors related to the top - down process @xcite .          after a target",
    "is selected , it is potentially useful for `` details on demand '' , or cognition . in general terms",
    ", cognition refers to the acquisition or use of knowledge @xcite , and may occur analytically ( conscious and slower ) or intuitively ( automatic and fast ) , as defended by the dual system theory @xcite@xcite .",
    "cognition is of special importance in data visualization as it supports analogical reasoning @xcite .",
    "that is , the transfer of inferences from a relationship of elements in one domain ( the analogue ) to a relationship of elements in another domain ( the target ) . in any case",
    ", cognition is intermediated by the memory system .",
    "the relationship between memory and cognition is studied by works on cognitive architectures , such as act - r @xcite and soar @xcite .    in soar and other theories , the _ structural configuration _ of memory roughly reflects the model of @xcite .",
    "working memory includes three components : the central executive module , the phonological loop , and the sketchpad .",
    "the central executive module determines the attention focus , guiding the visual system , for example , by top - down biasing the pyramidal selection mechanism . the phonological loop stores information related to sound .",
    "the sketchpad ( also known as visual short - term memory ",
    "vstm ) is associated with the maps of saliences discussed in section [ subsec : saliency_map ] , storing information related to space and to visual features .    following these lines",
    ", memory comes to be the main element in supporting cognition as it allows complex mental operations .",
    "consequently , it also supports the practice of data visualization .",
    "law @xcite states that the memory is limited to 7+/-2 elements ; more recent , and accepted , works state that this limit is at 4 _ chunks _ of elements  a chunk refers to the grouping of elements into larger units based on their meaning @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss memory limits considering the nature of the elements to be remembered , demonstrating that , despite the consensus of a ( very ) limited resource , there is not an ultimate conclusion about the topic . in any case , these limitations are severe because the greater the capacity of an individual s memory , the more information she / he has available for solving problems @xcite .",
    "the memory system supports cognition in two ways : by retaining a list of elements for quick referencing , and by assisting in the construction of _ mental models _ @xcite . according to @xcite ,",
    "mental models preserve the relationship between entities by defining analogies that save on logical reasoning , one of the principles behind complex visualization techniques and interaction @xcite . following the study of @xcite ,",
    "mental models are created in the visuo - spatial sketchpad , a specialization of vstm .",
    "stimuli encoded into vstm , ruled by cognition , may activate enduring information known as long - term memory , including facts , meanings , relationships , skills , and procedures @xcite  for a deeper discussion on working memory and long - term memory , refer to the work of @xcite .",
    "the concepts presented in the former sections rely on ideas posed by widely accepted theories , among several others , for the visual - cognitive process .",
    "the choice for this specific line of thought has been motivated by its intuitive coherence and scope of influence in the literature .",
    "notwithstanding , other theories are widely referenced , such as the spotlight @xcite and the gradient @xcite models . for an ample discussion ,",
    "refer to the work of @xcite .",
    "in this section , we review the practice of visualizing data by considering the concepts presented so far . we organize the relationship among visualization , vision , and cognition according to a framework named visual expression process ",
    "figure [ fig : visualexpressionprocess ] .",
    "our theoretical organization has four constituents : ( 1 ) pre - attentive stimuli , ( 2 ) analytical perceptions , ( 3 ) abstract patterns , and ( 4 ) decision support .",
    "for completeness of our survey , table [ tab : models ] summarizes previous models found in the literature .",
    "our theorization is inspired by these previous works putting together concepts in a complementary point of view .",
    "= 10000    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     = 50    by considering the concepts reviewed so far , it is possible to conceive a design language whose approach is based on cognition , and whose elements are interactive encoding channels , and analytical perceptions  refer to table [ tab : language ] for comparison . for example , in this design language , one would be able to state a visualization by choosing channel _ color _ and perception of _ differentiation_.",
    "this same visualization would demand a few more elements , as channel _ position _ and perception of _ correspondence_. as in any language , these elements would receive parameters according to an extensible library of data - to - marks mapping . in the case of relationships , one would be able to choose channel _ position _ with perception of _ arrangement _ , together with channel _ shape _ and perception of _",
    "connectivity_. underlying algorithms would abstract undesired complexity , as an algorithm for outlier detection to support color differentiation ; and a force - directed algorithm to support arrangement . as a design language",
    ", this approach would bring the benefit of discriminating the recurring elements of visualization techniques and having them in libraries for composition .",
    "this alternative approach contrasts with the usual practice of combining recurrent elements in ensembles assumed as new techniques .      according to @xcite , tools  or externalizations @xcite ",
    "transform difficult tasks into in - mind manipulations of physical systems , or into pattern - matching problems @xcite .",
    "pattern matching , or pattern - recognition @xcite , the association of a given stimulus to information retrieved from memory @xcite , is one of the principles of data visualization and the second step of the visual expression process ",
    "see figure [ fig : visualexpressionprocess ] .    according to our organization ,",
    "once a user focuses on an analytical perception , she / he proceeds to match this perception to an abstract pattern .",
    "based on the theory of vision  seen in section [ subsec : vision_and_memory ] , the generation of patterns is supported by memory , which is filled with data from the visual - sensorial system or from long - term memory .",
    "the efficiency of this intercourse is explained by the fact that the visual - sensorial system provides spatial information to memory at rates higher than that of long - term memory @xcite , in a time ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "hence , analytical perceptions in the visual - sensorial system work similarly to the images stored in long - term memory , providing efficient pattern - matching . according to the dual system theory , section [ subsec : vision_and_memory ] ,",
    "this process is conscious and slow ; but , with practice and experience , a given analyst can become a _",
    "specialist_. for specialists , pattern matching becomes intuitive @xcite  refer to the work of @xcite for a thorough discussion .",
    "it is a straight conclusion , then , that a period of practice and experience is necessary for most visualization techniques , and that this is an obstacle for use .",
    "a suggestive set of the patterns  third part of figure [ fig : visualexpressionprocess ]  that arise from the perception - to - pattern matching , includes : correlation , tendency , classification , relationship , order , summarization , outlier , cluster , structure , and reading . @xcite and",
    "@xcite provide more exhaustive listings that follow different rationalizations .      in our literature review",
    ", we noticed that many systems disregard the fact that visualization techniques converge through abstract patterns . according to current practices , instead of a set of familiar patterns",
    ", the user has to choose among a set of visualization designs that , quite often , they have little experience with @xcite . @xcite",
    "reinforce this notion ; they state that abstract patterns correspond to the second factor of their four - steps analytical - reasoning process . following their process  a pattern - to - construct sequence , users have constraints in relation to what they can search for in face of a given pattern .",
    "for example , suspiciousness tends to appear by means of tracking for outliers ; while evidence of illegal lobbying practices emerge from clusters ; and community detection in graphs is a task for relationship .",
    "still , users are often offered a menu whose options are , for instance , dimensional stacking @xcite , star coordinates @xcite , and table lens @xcite ; alternatives far from the pattern - to - construct task they have in their minds .",
    "a similar notion dates back to the 1990 s , in the work of @xcite , who advocates in favor of more specific problem - oriented choices .",
    "we suspect that , because design - oriented interfaces neglect the more natural notion of abstract patterns , this is possibly one of the reasons why advanced visualization techniques have struggled to achieve a wider commercial dissemination , e.g , in office suites and in everyday spreadsheets .",
    "take , for instance , the visualization technique treemap @xcite , introduced for visualizing hierarchical data in general . in two decades , treemap gained popularity at the academy , but , as a general hierarchical tool , it has failed in reaching a wider use .",
    "this is , possibly , because it has been criticized since its introduction @xcite , being accused of lacking cognitive plausibility , having poorly perceived aesthetic qualities , and presenting poor task - driven performance @xcite . despite all ,",
    "however , an especial design of the treemap has remarkably succeeded .",
    "the sequoiaview system ( www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview ) has achieved wide dissemination ( check @xcite for some impressive numbers ) , far beyond the academic walls .",
    "but , how can we have two flavors of the same technique evolve in different ways ?",
    "certainly , not one single aspect explains everything , but an outstanding factor comes up : the sequoiaview is domain and pattern - oriented , it is distributed to visualize the structure and the sizes of the files in your hard - drive , specifically . in accordance , users do not have to discover that the tool is good at doing this ; instead , when they have this specific problem at hand , they are guided to sequoiaview , a more natural process .    in designing systems ,",
    "an alternative course of action would be to initially present the user with a set of patterns to choose from .",
    "after that , she / he would be offered a set of visualization techniques that better suit the pattern they are seeking for .",
    "users may know what to look for by means of previous knowledge of the data domain , by means of known problems to be solved , by means of suspicious clues perceived along the data usage , and also by means of previous visual exploration of the data .",
    "after producing patterns , vision is no longer an active agent , neither pre - attentively nor attentively . now , the analysis follows the widely accepted pattern - then - cognition process @xcite @xcite to achieve decision support . indeed , according to the analytical reasoning of @xcite , information visualization",
    "can not ultimately provide decision support , which can only be achieved after interpreting the patterns in light of the data domain  rightmost side of figure [ fig : visualexpressionprocess ] .",
    "that is , even though users can come up with patterns without considering the underlying data , these patterns are not of great use if the domain is not deeply understood .",
    "insufficient domain knowledge leads to unsatisfied expectations in relation to infovis , creating situations in which a user is presented to a supposedly insightful visualization but , then , everything one hears is `` so what '' ?",
    "a disappointment that happens due to the enthusiasm according to which one can solve a wide range of problems just by looking at the data .",
    "however , visualization tools can do little if the analyst is not well - prepared to assess what the data ultimately describes and potentially carries within .      to prevent the aforementioned problems ,",
    "infovis systems should define systematic means to aid the user in recording and accessing the domain knowledge related to the problems at hand . an interesting approach to overcome",
    "the gap of domain knowledge is to use annotations ( or _ analytic provenance _",
    "@xcite ) , either automatic or manual .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , annotations help to direct the user s attention and foreground particular insights , supporting the most efficient inferences .",
    "the work of @xcite exemplifies this issue .",
    "their work focuses on stock - price time series , which are hard to understand if one is not aware of the facts that influenced the behavior of the market .",
    "their system solves this problem by identifying news that happened contemporaneously to outstanding patterns found in the plots , presenting them on demand  illustrated in figure [ fig : hullman ] .",
    "similar approaches @xcite have been proposed for genomic data , an extreme case in which domain knowledge is necessary , otherwise no reading of the data ( either visual or textual ) will make sense .",
    "an alternative is to use technique _ storytelling _ , as surveyed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite defends that advanced interfaces need to address the long - term process of analysis that may require annotation , history keeping , collaboration with peers , and the dissemination of results and procedures used .",
    "storytelling not only attacks the problem of lacking domain knowledge , it also provides knowledge about new findings in the form of further `` story chapters '' interactively created .",
    "the visual analysis , potentially , becomes an incremental set of insights from multiple experts in the form of bookmarks , keyword tags , text comments , and audio annotations .    by bringing existing ( factual ) or produced ( annotated ) domain knowledge to the stage , abstract patterns",
    "can support reasoning by supporting conditional inferences @xcite , possibly influenced by statistical regularities @xcite .",
    "the result is the provision of inferences for decision making , notably , predictions , alternatives , and evaluations as depicted in figure [ fig : visualexpressionprocess ] .      in sections [ subsec : pre_attentive_stimuli ] through [ subsec : decisionsupport ] , we have drawn conclusions by surveying accepted concepts of vision and cognition . notwithstanding , we state these conclusions as conjectures with theoretical evidence and with examples .",
    "this is because the validation of these hypotheses would encompass vast experimentation ; producing material enough to spam a few papers or a book , to be conservative .",
    "therefore , we leave our discussions both as contributions  to guide new systematizations ; and , as future work  to drive further refinements and discoveries",
    ".    our conclusions also point to a challenging systematization .",
    "rendering all the recommended aspects , together with multiple techniques and data domains , might involve a development effort similar to that of huge software pieces , as office suites for instance .",
    "this is academically non - attractive , and economically risky .",
    "possibly , the solution is to set a well - defined development framework for collaborative work , with ample acceptation , and standard interfacing . in the realm of machine learning ,",
    "software weka @xcite has achieved great success in a similar endeavor .",
    "however , the graphical nature of infovis , and its data preprocessing techniques , imposes big challenges .",
    "we reviewed concepts on vision , cognition , and information visualization by introducing the organizational theorization named _ visual expression process _ , which proposes a course of action to explain visual data analysis . over an extensive literature survey ,",
    "the theorization provides comprehension and science for data graphical presentation .",
    "it proposes a new perspective to discuss and characterize techniques . from this perspective , for instance , it would be possible to `` dissect '' a given technique in terms of the channels , the analytical perceptions and the patterns that it supports , potentially revealing strengths and weaknesses .",
    "our contributions are as follows :    * theoretical compendium : we plotted the visual expression process to interrelate vision , cognition , and information visualization ; * discussions : we provided an extensive survey from different fields of science to serve as basis for relevant debate ; * reflections : we revisited design practices supported by examples and study cases .",
    "overall , we have put together key concepts to introduce an insightful consideration of visualizations .",
    "the reductionist perspective of our organization translates non - familiar concepts of vision and cognition into their corresponding effects with respect to design . in the form of a vocabulary",
    "taxonomically organized , we proposed a simplified comprehension of the factors that define techniques and systems . with our contributions , we expect to foster a more comprehensive , accessible , and applied science of visualization .",
