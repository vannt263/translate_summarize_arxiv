    "the purpose of this paper is to develop analytic expressions for option - pricing of markets with fluctuating volatilities of a given distribution .",
    "there are several good reasons for considering the statistical properties of volatilities .",
    "for instance , a number of important models of price changes include explicitly their time - dependence , for example the heston model  @xcite , or the famous arch  @xcite , garch  @xcite , and multiscale garch  @xcite models .",
    "changes in the daily volatility are qualitatively well explained by models relating volatility to the amount of information arriving in the market at a given time  @xcite .",
    "there is also considerable practical interest in volatility distributions since they provide traders with an essential quantitative information on the riskiness of an asset  @xcite .",
    "as such it provides a key input in portfolio construction .",
    "unlike returns which are correlated only on very short time scales  @xcite of a few minutes and can roughly be approximated by markovian process , the volatility changes exhibit memory with time correlations up to many years  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the standard & poor 500 ( hereafter s&p 500 ) volatility data can be fitted quite well by a log - normal distribution .",
    "this result appears to be at odds with the fact that the log - normal shape of the distribution typically signalizes a multiplicative nature  @xcite of an underlying stochastic process .",
    "this is rather surprising in view of efficient market theories  @xcite which assume that the price changes are caused by incoming new information about an asset .",
    "such information - induced price changes are additive and should not give rise to multiplicative process .",
    "we cure this contradiction by observing that the same volatility data can be fitted equally well by a chi distribution  @xcite . in appendix",
    "a we show that corresponding sample paths follow the additive rather than multiplicative it stochastic process . with the help of it s lemma",

    ", we shall confine in the following to the name chi distribution .",
    "the derivation of @xmath17 from the underlying additive process , rather than a multiplicative process , shows that the chi distribution is well compatible with efficient markets .",
    "the gamma distributions for fluctuations of @xmath10 allow us to generate an entirely new class of option pricing formulas .",
    "for this we use the well - known fact of non - equilibrium statistical physics  @xcite , that the density matrix of a system with fluctuating temperature can be written as a density matrix for the system with fixed temperature averaged with respect to a temperature distribution function .",
    "path integrals conveniently facilitate this task  @xcite . with the help of the so - called schwinger trick",
    "we show that if the distribution of the inverse - temperatures of the log - returns is of the gamma type , the distribution in momentum space is of the tsallis type . to put this observation into a relevant context , we recall that tsallis distributions in momentum space enjoy a key role in statistical physics as being optimal in an information theoretical sense : given prior information only on the covariance matrix and a so - called escort parameter",
    ", they contain the least possible assumptions , i.e. , they are the most likely unbiased representation of the provided data .",
    "some background material on this subject is reviewed in appendix  c. the observed connection with tsallis distribution in momentum space can be fruitfully used to address the issue of the time - compounded density function for stock fluctuations with chi distributed volatility .",
    "the markovian property of the market prices then simply translates to product of distributions in momentum space . at the level of the distributions of log - returns ,",
    "this automatically gives rise to the correct chapman - kolmogorov equation for markovian processes .",
    "the time - compounded distribution function constructed by convolution of integrals represents the desired measure of stock fluctuations at given time @xmath9 .",
    "it should be emphasized that since the distribution of log - returns is related to the tsallis distribution in momentum space by a fourier transform , the log - return data do not inherit the heavy tails of the tsallis distribution in momentum space . in this respect",
    "our approach is quite different from data analysis based on a tsallis distribution of log - returns , such as the so - called  non - extensive thermostatic \" @xcite .",
    "the formal advantage of our model lies in its optimal use of the mathematical machinery of the black - scholes theory .",
    "in particular , one still has the option pricing formula that is linear in the spot probability of the strike - price payment .",
    "put and call options still obey the put - call parity relation , and the @xmath1-hedge still coincides with the spot probability that multiplies the asset price in the black - scholes formula . on the other hand ,",
    "the desired features such as peaked middles of financial asset fluctuations and semi - fat tails are present for sufficiently long times .",
    "the latter ensures that ensuing option prices can differ noticeably from the black - scholes curves for rather long expiration dates ( days or even moths ) despite the validity of central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "one may thus expect our formulation to be useful , e.g. , for short or mid - term maturity options (  mesoscopic \" time lags ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2a ]",
    "we fit the high - frequency data set of the volatility fluctuations in the s&p 500 index from 1985 to 2007 to a chi distribution .",
    "we also show that this fit holds well for different time averaging windows . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we represent the distribution of log - returns as a superposition of gaussian distributions with the above volatility behavior and find that the associated distribution in momentum space is of the tsallis type . by assuming further that the compounded stock fluctuations over longer times are markovian we obtain in section  [ opf ] the corresponding natural martingale measure . with it",
    "we derive an option - pricing formula as a superposition of black - scholes expressions .",
    "the departure from black - scholes results is expressed as a sum of two qualitatively different expansions : expansion in powers of the excess curtosis and expansion in momenta of moneyness .",
    "the former represents the expansion in market characteristics while the latter is an expansion based on contract characteristics . in section  [ sec8 ]",
    "we determine the crossover time below which our option prices differs from black - scholes .",
    "comparisons with observed log - returns are presented in section  [ sec6b ] .",
    "there we show that for the dow jones euro stoxx 50 data the amount of the residual risk in the @xmath1-hedge portfolio is very small and that the crossover time is roughly @xmath18 months .",
    "section  [ sec7 ] , finally , is devoted to conclusions . for reader",
    "s convenience we also include three appendices . in appendix  a we solve and discuss the fokker - planck equations that are associated with stochastic equations for the volatility and variance presented in introduction . in appendix",
    "b we deal with some mathematical manipulations needed in section  [ opf ] . in appendix",
    "c we present some basics for rnyi and thc statistics to better understand some remarks in the main body of the paper .",
    "our work is motivated by data sets on volatility distributions extracted from the s&p 500 stock market index .",
    "we briefly remind the reader the procedure for obtaining these numbers .",
    "a detailed description can be found in ref.@xcite and citations therein .",
    "it is well known that the autocorrelation function of stock market returns decays exponentially with a short characteristic time  typically few trading minutes ( e.g. , @xmath19 min . for s&p 500 index ) .",
    "hence the log - returns @xmath20 are basically uncorrelated random variables , nevertheless , they are not independent since higher - order correlations reveal a richer structure . in fact , empirical analysis of financial data confirms  @xcite that the autocorrelation function of non - linear functions of @xmath20 , such as @xmath21 or @xmath22 , has much longer decorrelation time ( memory ) spanning up to several years ( few months for s&p 500 index ) .",
    "these observations imply that a realistic model for the return - generating processes should account for a non - linear dependence in the returns .",
    "the latter can be most naturally achieved via some additional memory - bearing stochastic process .",
    "most simply , this subsidiary process involves directly the volatility .",
    "one may bypass a construction of the volatility model by trying to define a  judicious \" volatility estimator directly from financial time series .",
    "difficulty resides , however , in the fact that although the volatility is supposed to be a measure of the magnitude of market fluctuations , it is not immediately clear how such a measure should be quantified . among many definitions present in the literature",
    "@xcite we focuss here on the estimator proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "there one defines the volatility @xmath23 , at a given time @xmath24 as the arithmetic average of the absolute value of the log - returns @xmath11 r(t_n ) \\",

    "there is , however , a logical caveat in the definition ( [ ii.5 ] ) .",
    "the observed volatility fluctuations have a spuriously superposed pattern caused by intra - day fluctuations .",
    "this is because over the day , the market activity is large at the beginning and at the end , but exhibits a broad minimum around a noon  @xcite . since the volatility is supposed to measure the magnitude of the market activity , this intra - day pattern should be removed in order to avoid false correlations .",

    ", the returns preserve some of typical features of the original black - scholes model , namely they follow a linear it stochastic equation with multiplicative noise ( though with stochastic volatility ) and a continuous stock dynamics .",
    "second , the associated density operator in momentum space is of the tsallis type .",
    "the inverse tsallis temperature then agrees with the average variance of the distribution .",
    "our main result is a generalized black - scholes pricing formula that takes into account the above volatility behavior . with the help of",
    "a mellin transform we were able to find an ensuing analytic solution for the price of european call options .",
    "the result is expressed as a series in the higher normalized cumulants and in higher moments of moneyness . due to a spread parameter @xmath69 related to the extra kurtosis of the log - return data ,",
    "our model is capable of calibration to a richer set of observed market histories than the simple black - scholes model , which is a special case corresponding to a zero spread @xmath63 , or to a very long time horizon ( @xmath249 ) .",
    "comparisons with other time - dependent volatility models such as arch  @xcite , garch  @xcite or multiscale garch  @xcite will be addressed in future work .    in the light of recent works on superstatistics",
    "we should mention that the density operator representation ( [ 3.3 ] ) reveals the superstatistic nature of the tsallis distribution in momentum space . recently , c.  beck  @xcite and c.  beck and e.  cohen  @xcite , prompted by the works by g.  wilk and z.  wlodarczyk  @xcite , have suggested that the origin of certain heavy - tail distributions should be understood as weighted averages of the usual exponential statistics .",
    "such averages have been used also in the textbook @xcite to calculate option prices for non - gaussian distributions @xcite .",
    "recently , f.  sattin  @xcite rephrased the same procedure in terms of evolving systems embedded within a static but non - trivial background .",
    "all these approaches commonly strive to interpret broad distributions as a result of an averaging of usual exponential ( gibbs ) distributions over certain fluctuating ( random ) parameter .",
    "this is the procedure running under the name superstatistics  @xcite .",
    "although frequently used , superstatistics procedure is still far from being systematized and , in fact , smearing distributions are usually chosen to fit experimental data .",
    "the theory of option pricing in this work may therefore be viewed as an example for superstatistics with a smeared gaussian representing the probability distribution of volatilities .",
    "finally , the present scenario also provides an interesting meaning to the tsallis escort parameter @xmath68 . in option pricing models where stock fluctuations are directly fitted by a tsallis distribution of returns  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath68 parameter is a fit parameter with a typical value around @xmath250 . in the present case where the momentum distribution is of the tsallis type ,",
    "@xmath251 is proportional to the characteristic time @xmath177 below which the gaussian treatment of stock fluctuations is inadequate .",
