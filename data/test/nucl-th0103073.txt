    "the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern are designed with the goal of producing an equilibrated phase of deconfined partonic matter : the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "lattice - qcd simulations  @xcite and well - constrained phenomenological models  @xcite predict a second order phase transition at @xmath0mev ; i.e. , at energy densities @xmath1gev/@xmath2 , in the equilibrium two light - flavour theory . for more than two flavours the characteristics of the transition are not as clear , but",
    "there is a transition .",
    "a number of phenomena have been proposed as signals for the existence of an equilibrated qgp  @xcite but the nonequilibrium stages in the plasma s development are poorly understood and it is a contemporary challenge to develop a description of the spacetime evolution of an ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision ( urhic ) : from particle production in the collision , through equilibration and plasma formation , and on to hadronisation .",
    "two methods are commonly used to describe the production of partons in a collision : a perturbative pre - formed parton picture  @xcite and a nonperturbative flux - tube - based picture  @xcite .",
    "they are complementary , and monte - carlo event generators  @xcite and hydrodynamical models  @xcite have been developed to facilitate the analysis of data using either production model .",
    "herein we focus on the pre - equilibrium particle - production stage in the evolution of a qgp and choose to employ a flux - tube model . in this model",
    "the two colliding nuclei are imagined to pass through one another and stretch a high energy - density flux - tube between themselves as they separate .",
    "this flux tube , which describes the highly excited qcd vacuum , decays via a nonperturbative particle - antiparticle production process analogous to the schwinger mechanism .",
    "particle production by the flux tube is described by a source term and in quantum field theory that source term is non - markovian  @xcite ; i.e. , essentially nonlocal in time .",
    "this feature can be important when the fields are strong .",
    "( in the weak - field limit a time - local schwinger - like source term is recovered . )",
    "such a situation is plausible at rhic and especially at lhc  @xcite where the anticipated initial energy densities are , respectively , @xmath3@xmath4gev/@xmath2 and @xmath5tev/@xmath2 .",
    "another feature that is characteristic of the flux - tube production mechanism is the back - reaction phenomenon .",
    "this phrase simply describes the fact that once the particles are produced they are accelerated and thereby generate a field that interferes with the collisional field that produced them .",
    "plasma oscillations are then almost inevitable  @xcite , although they can rapidly be damped if the thermalising collisions between particles are frequent  @xcite .",
    "an observable that may preserve information about non - markovian effects and plasma oscillations in the pre - equilibrium particle - production stage of an urhic is the thermal dilepton spectrum because leptons do not participate in the strong interactions that equilibrate the qgp  @xcite . to explore that possibility",
    ", we employ a quantum vlasov equation with a non - markovian source term to calculate the single particle distribution function that characterises particle production by the flux tube , @xmath6 , and use that to calculate the dilepton spectrum and its evolution from impact to equilibration .    of course ,",
    "equilibration can only be effected by dissipative processes , such as collisions , and herein we describe those effects via a relaxation time approximation ( rta ) .",
    "this is a coarse representation of the interactions between the partons produced in the collision but , even so , ensuring thermodynamic consistency is nontrivial .",

    "we assume that in its wake an urhic leaves a high energy - density electric field , which occupies a large ( in fact , unbounded ) spacetime volume .",
    "this excited domain decays via a schwinger - like mechanism , producing an unequilibrated plasma of highly energetic quarks and antiquarks .",
    "that system evolves and equilibrates , forming a component of the qgp .",
    "hadronisation only takes place at a later stage , when the temperature and density of the equilibrated system fall below some critical values , and herein we do not consider that process .",
    "we represent the excited domain by a spatially homogeneous , time - dependent abelian vector potential , @xmath7 , and work in the temporal gauge : @xmath8 .",
    "the spatial part of the vector potential defines the @xmath9-direction ; i.e. , @xmath10 , and generates an electric field @xmath11 .",
    "this provides the input for the quantum kinetic equations whose solution describes the evolution of the single parton distribution functions that characterise the produced partons : @xmath12 @xmath13 is the electric charge and @xmath14 denotes bosons / fermions ; and @xmath15 gives the ensemble fraction of particles with a given momentum , @xmath16 , at time @xmath17 . the analogous equation for antiparticles , which is obtained via charge conjugation and must be solved simultaneously , yields @xmath18 , the single antiparticle distribution function .",

    "<S> ' '' ''    aspects of the formation and equilibration of a quark - gluon plasma are explored using a quantum kinetic equation , which involves a non - markovian , abelian source term for quark and antiquark production and , for the collision term , a relaxation time approximation that defines a time - dependent quasi - equilibrium temperature and collective velocity . </S>",
    "<S> the strong abelian field is determined via the simultaneous solution of maxwell s equation . </S>",
    "<S> a particular feature of this approach is the appearance of plasma oscillations in all thermodynamic observables . </S>",
    "<S> their presence can lead to a sharp increase in the time - integrated dilepton yield . </S>"
