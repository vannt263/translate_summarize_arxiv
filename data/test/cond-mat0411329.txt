    "in view of various applications such as the study of two  dimensional melting @xcite , investigations of mesoscale structure formation @xcite or engineering of colloidal crystals on spherical surfaces @xcite , the self  assembly of sub-@xmath0 m colloidal particles at water  air or water  oil interfaces has gained much interest in recent years .",

    ", the colloids can be stabilized sterically with polymers or with charges such that the colloids repel each other .",
    "variants of charge stabilization may include the coverage with ionizable molecules which dissociate in water , or the labeling of colloids with charged fluorescent markers . for charge",
    " stabilized colloids at large distances , the resulting repulsive force at water interfaces stems from a dipole",
    " dipole interaction as shown theoretically for point charges on surfaces @xcite and verified experimentally for polystyrene ( ps ) spheres on water  oil interfaces @xcite .    nonetheless , charged colloids at interfaces also show attractions far beyond the range of van  der  waals forces .",
    "the corresponding experimental evidence can be roughly classified as follows .",
    "( i ) according to refs .",
    "@xcite , ps spheres ( radii @xmath1 @xmath0 m ) on flat water  air interfaces using highly deionized water exhibit spontaneous formation of complicated metastable mesostructures .",
    "they are consistent with the presence of an attractive , secondary minimum in the intercolloidal potential at distances @xmath2 with a depth of a few @xmath3 .",
    "the use of water slightly contaminated by ions seems to move the minimum further out and to reduce its depth @xcite .",

    "the tentative explanation of these findings given in ref .",
    "@xcite invokes an analogue of long  ranged flotation or capillary forces which decay @xmath6 .",
    "this interpretation was criticized in ref .",

    "@xcite in which the authors claim that long  ranged capillary forces @xmath6 caused by the colloidal charges persist for sub-@xmath0 m particles .",
    "this conclusion is based on measurements of the meniscus shape around single glass spheres with radii 200  300 @xmath0 m floating at water  oil and water  air interfaces .    motivated by the experimental data summarized above and the still incomplete theoretical understanding , here we undertake a quite general analysis of capillary interactions between two spherical colloids trapped at fluid interfaces .",
    "we characterize the system by a general stress field which acts on the interface , e.g. , due to a discontinuous electrostatic field at the interface , and by forces on the colloid of gravitational and/or electrostatic origin .",
    "special attention will be given to the role of a restoring force fixing the interface , e.g. , due to gravity or interface pinning . in sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we apply the results to the case of charged polymeric spheres on water interfaces .",
    "it turns out that the constraint of approximate mechanical isolation of the experimental systems renders the capillary interaction basically short  ranged .",
    "long  ranged attractive forces @xmath6 only arise through a restoring force acting on the interface ( which is , however , weak ) or in the presence of an external electric field .",

    "we model the colloid as a smooth sphere so that the system is invariant under rotations around the colloid axis perpendicular to the reference planar meniscus .",
    "the presence of charges induces a shift of the system ( colloid and interface ) with respect to the reference state .",
    "here we neglect corresponding changes in the surface tensions @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; this approximation is expected to be valid provided the concentration of charges is sufficiently small .",
    "this shift is characterized by the meniscus profile @xmath15 relative to the planar configuration and by the height @xmath16 of the colloid center . in the reference configuration , the charge distribution is assumed to be already in equilibrium . in the following",
    "we do not consider the degree of freedom `` charge density field '' explicitly but take it to be fixed to that of the reference configuration .",
    "this amounts to neglecting the feedback of the interface displacement on the charge distribution .",

    "we introduce the following dimensionless parameter to measure the relative strength of this force : @xmath22 where the integral extends over the flat meniscus @xmath23 ( the plane @xmath24 with a circular hole of radius @xmath25 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath26 with @xmath27 , so that the integral converges . in the same spirit",
    "we introduce the total vertical force @xmath28 acting on the charged colloid in the flat reference configuration , which includes gravity , the electrostatic force , and the total ( i.e. , hydrostatic and osmotic ) pressure exerted by the fluids .",
    "this leads to the definition @xmath29 these two dimensionless parameters will appear naturally in the course of the calculations .",

    "@xcite the attraction of particles trapped at a nematic  air interface is reported and an explanation in terms of a logarithmic meniscus deformation is proposed which parallels the explanation given in ref .",

    "our detailed theoretical treatment shows that no long  range ( logarithmic ) meniscus distortion can arise on an interface if the system is mechanically isolated and the excess free energy of the perturbed interface is correctly described by an expression like eq .",

    "thus it appears that the simple explanation of the observed colloidal attractions given in ref .",
    "@xcite is not correct .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the free energy of a distorted nematic  air interface is equivalent to that of a simple fluid interface due to the long  ranged interactions in the nematic bulk caused by defects .",
    "thus , a generalization of our theory to interfaces involving nematic phases would be desirable in order to assess the possibility of long  ranged colloidal attractions in more detail .",
    "we have analyzed the effective force induced by capillary deformation between two smooth spherical colloids floating at a fluid interface .",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom are the meniscus deformation and the height of the colloids ( fig .",
