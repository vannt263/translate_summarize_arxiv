    "from the early studies of brownian motion , more than a hundred years ago  @xcite , the use of stochastic differential equations to model a wide variety of dynamical systems has grown dramatically .",
    "applications can be found along a wide area of scientific research , from physics and chemistry  @xcite , through biology and ecology  @xcite , to economy and social sciences  @xcite .    in the original formulation of brownian motion ,",
    "the influence of the medium on a diffusive particle is modeled by splitting its effect in two parts : a deterministic one , given by an homogeneous viscous force , and a stochastic part , given by a random force with zero expectation value . in this way ,",
    "fluctuations exhibit as an _ additive _ noise and , consequently , the considered model represents an _ additive stochastic process _ described by a langevin equation . however , the viscous force could have non - homogeneous contributions , for instance , in the presence of boundary conditions , such as a diffusion of a brownian particle near a wall  @xcite .",
    "if the diffusion is not homogeneous , fluctuations could depend on the state of the system and they can be regarded as the product of a random force and a function of the state variable . in that situation , _ multiplicative _",
    "noise is defined and the model is known as a _ multiplicative stochastic process_. another interesting example of multiplicative noise is the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation  @xcite , used to describe dynamics of classical magnetic moments of individual magnetic nano - particles . in this case , the noisy fluctuations of the magnetic field couple the magnetic moment in a multiplicative way .",
    "the classification of additive or multiplicative noise should be considered in the more general context of external and internal noise  @xcite . in the former case , dissipation and noise",
    "can be considered as two effects with different microscopic origin . in other words , in the absence of noise , the classical deterministic system is perfectly well defined . however , in the latter case , dissipation and fluctuation have the same intrinsic origin and it is not possible to `` turn off '' one of these effects .",
    "the theory of stochastic evolution provides a beautiful connection between dynamics and statistical physics .",
    "in general , einstein relation or , more generally , fluctuation - dissipation relations associate dynamical properties of the system with thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , stochastic dynamics not necessarily model physical systems , where the long time evolution should conduce to thermodynamical equilibrium . in fact , it is possible to have more general stationary state distributions that represent an equilibrium state in the stochastic dynamical sense , not related to thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , stochastic dynamics provide an interesting approach to out - of - equilibrium statistical mechanics  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to attribute thermodynamical concepts like heat , entropy or free energy to each trajectory of an stochastic evolution , given rise to the research field usually called stochastic thermodynamics  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we would like to present a study of equilibrium properties of markovian multiplicative white - noise processes . a prototype of these processes is represented by the langevin equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) .",
    "it is well known that , due to the gaussian white - noise distribution , the continuum limit of the discretized time evolution of multiplicative processes is not unique .",
    "in fact , there are different prescriptions to perform this limit . perhaps , the most popular prescriptions are the it  @xcite and the stratonovich  @xcite ones , each one producing a different stochastic evolution and forcing different rules of calculus",
    ". we will discuss in detail equilibrium properties in the more general prescription called generalized stratonovich convention  @xcite ( also called `` @xmath0-convention ''  @xcite in the field theory literature ) . in this prescription",
    ", a continuum parameter @xmath1 is defined in such a way that each value of the parameter corresponds to a different discretization rule of the stochastic differential equation .",
    "the value @xmath2 corresponds with the it prescription while @xmath3 is the stratonovich one .",
    "the concept of equilibrium is tightly related with the concept of time reversal symmetry .",
    "for this reason , it is essential to carefully define the time reversal transformation of the stochastic process . in multiplicative white - noise processes ,",
    "the forward and backward stochastic trajectories evolve with different prescriptions ( except when considering stratonovich convention ) .",
    "for instance , if it convention ( @xmath2 ) is defined for the forward evolution , the backward trajectory evolves with the so called hnggi - klimontovich  @xcite prescription ( @xmath4 ) . in general",
    ", we will show that the prescription @xmath0 is the time reversal conjugate of @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , since the asymptotic stationary probability distribution also depends on the chosen prescription , the correct definition of time reversal transformation , compatible with a unique equilibrium distribution , is quite involved .",
    "it is very useful to use , instead of the langevin or fokker - planck approach , a path integral formalism  @xcite , in which the central object of the theory is a set of stochastic trajectories . using this formalism",
    ", we will analyze equilibrium properties , such as detailed balance relations , microscopic reversibility and entropy production .",
    "we will show that , due to a careful definition of equilibrium distribution and taken into account the appropriate time reversal transformation , usual equilibrium properties are satisfied for _ any value of @xmath0_. even thought the path integral representation of the stochastic process is suitable for the computation of correlation functions and responses , specific calculations are very cumbersome , since each value of @xmath0 defines different differentiation and integration rules .",
    "in particular , the `` chain rule '' to compute total derivatives of a stochastic process depends on @xmath0 .",
    "we make a generalization of the it formula for any value of the discretization parameter . in this work ,",
    "we explicitly show the importance of this `` generalized chain rule '' , in the path integral formalism .",
    "the stochastic process can also be represented as a path integral in an extended functional space , by introducing auxiliary commutative as well as anti - commutative grassman variables .",
    "the main advantage of this extension for multiplicative noisy systems resides in the prescription independent character of the formulation . while in the original path",
    "integral formulation the prescription appears as a continuum limit ambiguity , in the functional grassman formalism , the ambiguity appears in the definition of equal - time grassman green functions  @xcite . in this way , provided we do not integrate the grassman variables , we can perform any calculation without specifying a particular prescription . in some sense",
    ", all the difficulty introduced by the generalized it calculus is being codified in a simpler grassman algebra .    as a by - product , it is possible to study hidden symmetries of the stochastic process .",
    "indeed , the class of systems we have studied in this paper is invariant under linear transformations in the extended functional space .",
    "this hidden symmetry , called supersymmetry ( susy ) , was recognized in other stochastic processes several years ago  @xcite .",
    "susy properties have been extensively studied for additive stochastic processes  @xcite and for non - markovian multiplicative processes  @xcite . in another hand , for markovian multiplicative white - noise systems ,",
    "important progresses have recently been reported  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty in the susy formulation of a markov multiplicative process is related with the great variety of prescriptions available to define the wiener integral , which produces several stochastic evolutions with different final steady states .",
    "moreover , time reversal transformations mix different prescriptions .    in this paper , we deduce a covariant supersymmetric formulation of a multiplicative markov process showing in detail the importance of the prescription dependent equilibrium distribution and the correct definition of time reversal transformation .    physically , susy encodes equilibrium properties of the system .",
    "some of the constraints it imposes on correlation functions ( ward - takahashi identities ) are related to fluctuation - dissipation theorems  @xcite .",
    "this property has acquired a refreshing interest due to the growing importance of stochastic out - of - equilibrium systems  @xcite . in this sense , it is possible to understand out - of - equilibrium dynamics as a symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "we analyze in detail ward - takahashi identities specially related with fluctuation - dissipation theorems .",
    "we show that this theorem is fulfilled independently of the chosen prescription to define the process . however",
    ", the linear response , fluctuations , as well as the equilibrium distribution , do depend on the specific prescription .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .  [ model ] we define our model by means of a langevin equation with multiplicative noise . in sect .",
    "[ timereversal ] we carefully study the problem of time reversal symmetry and the equilibrium probability distribution . with these results ,",
    "we analyze properties such as detailed balance and entropy production in sect .",
    "[ detailedbalance ] . in sect .",
    "[ susy ] , we present a covariant supersymmetric formulation of the stochastic process and we deduce the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for arbitrary prescriptions . finally , we discuss our conclusions in sect .",
    "[ discussion ] , leading for [ appendix ] some details of the calculations .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to define the model and to establish the concepts and the notation we use in the rest of the paper . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a single random variable @xmath6 satisfying a first order differential equation given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a gaussian white noise , @xmath9 the drift term @xmath10 and the square root of the diffusion function @xmath11 are , in principle , arbitrary smooth functions of @xmath6 .",
    "the only restrictive condition is that @xmath11 should be `` invertible '' , _",
    "i. e. _ , @xmath12 .",
    "as it is very well known , to completely define equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) , it is necessary to give sense to the ill - defined product @xmath13 , since @xmath8 is delta correlated .",
    "the problem can be easily understood looking at the integral @xmath14 where we have defined the wiener process @xmath15 as @xmath16 . by definition , the riemann - stieltjes integral is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is taken in the interval @xmath19 $ ] and the limit is taken in the sense of _ mean - square limit _  @xcite . for a smooth measure @xmath15",
    ", the limit converges to a unique value , regardless the value of @xmath18 .",
    "however , @xmath15 is not smooth , in fact , it is nowhere integrable . in any interval",
    ", white noise fluctuates an infinite number of times with infinite variance .",
    "therefore , the value of the integral depends on the prescription for the choice of @xmath18 .",
    "there are several prescriptions to define this integral that can be summarized in the so called `` generalized stratonovich prescription ''  @xcite or `` @xmath0-prescription ''  @xcite , for which we choose @xmath20 in this way , @xmath2 corresponds with the pre - point it interpretation and @xmath3 coincides with the ( mid - point ) stratonovich one .",
    "moreover , the post - point prescription , @xmath4 , is also known as the kinetic or the hnggi - klimontovich interpretation  @xcite .    in principle",
    ", each particular choice of @xmath0 fixes a different stochastic evolution .",
    "in many physical applications , a weakly colored gaussian - markov noise with a finite variance  @xcite is considered . in this case",
    ", there is no problem with the interpretation of equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) and we can take the limit of infinite variance at the end of the calculations .",
    "this regularization procedure is equivalent to the stratonovich interpretation , @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , in other applications , like chemical langevin equations  @xcite or econometric problems  @xcite , the noise can be considered principally white , since it could be a reduction of jump - like or poisson like processes . in such cases , the it interpretation ( @xmath2 )",
    "should be more suitable .",
    "hence , the interpretation of equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) depends on the physics behind a particular application .",
    "once the interpretation is fixed , the stochastic dynamics is unambiguously defined .",
    "summarizing , in order to completely define the stochastic process described by equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) we need to fix a couple of functions @xmath21 and the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0-prescription introduces some difficulties in the proper definition of time reversal evolution that we describe in this section .      using equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) and the @xmath0-prescription",
    ", it is immediate to obtain  @xcite a fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution @xmath22 :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 .",
    "this equation can be cast into a continuity equation , @xmath25 whith the probability current given by @xmath26 p(x ,",

    "however , due to the fact that @xmath22 is normalized to one , for any value of @xmath31 , then @xmath32 .    we suppose that , at long times , the probability rapidly converges to a steady state @xmath33 , given by @xmath34 with the normalization constant @xmath35 . in this state , the stationary current gets the form @xmath36 and the stationary fokker - planck equation acquires the simpler form @xmath37 or , simply , @xmath38 .    thus , for a given value of @xmath39 , we could have a stationary state characterized by the function @xmath40 .",
    "the stationary probability density @xmath41 does not represent , in general , an equilibrium state .",
    "an equilibrium state is characterized by a net zero stationary current ( @xmath42 ) . when @xmath43 , although the current is already conserved , there is a stationary probability flux , characterizing an out - of - equilibrium regime . in most physical applications ,",
    "the diffusion function @xmath11 is a polynomially growing function for large @xmath44 . in these cases",
    "( and for a single variable ) , the only possible solution is the equilibrium one @xmath45 .",
    "however , for exponentially growing functions , out - of - equilibrium steady state solutions are possible .",
    "let us focus on the equilibrium state , defined as the solution of the stationary fokker - planck equation with zero current probability .",
    "thus , for @xmath42 , there is an obvious solution of equations  ( [ eq.js ] ) and ( [ eq.stationaryfp ] ) , given by @xmath46 therefore , given the functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , supplemented by a value of @xmath47 , the probability density tends at long times to the equilibrium distribution @xmath48 where @xmath49 is given by equation  ( [ eq.equilibriumpotential ] ) , provided @xmath50 is integrable to define the normalization constant @xmath51 .    in the case",
    "that equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) models a conservative physical system , _ i.  e.  _ , if the otherwise deterministic system is characterized by an energy potential @xmath52 , the drift function @xmath10 does not depend explicitly on time and is given by @xmath53 this equation relates fluctuations ( given by @xmath11 ) with dissipation , therefore it can be considered as a local generalization of einstein relation for brownian motion . using this expression , the equilibrium `` potential '' has the form : @xmath54 as expected , the equilibrium distribution depends , not only on the given functions @xmath55 or , alternatively , on @xmath56 , but also on the value of the @xmath0-prescription which defines the wiener integral .",
    "if equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) is used to model a physical system , which is expected to asymptotically converge to thermodynamic equilibrium ( @xmath57 ) , the only possible choice is the hnggi - klimontovich interpretation @xmath4 ; for this reason , the election of @xmath4 is sometimes called `` thermal prescription '' . recently ,",
    "an experimental evaluation of @xmath0 was reported  @xcite in the study of a falling colloidal particle near a wall . in this work ,",
    "the value of @xmath4 was recognized as the proper one to make the correctly identification of the microscopic forces acting on the colloidal particle . with any other choice , the equilibrium potential @xmath58 , including the usual it ( @xmath2 ) and stratonovich ( @xmath3 ) prescriptions .    except for the stratonovich prescription @xmath3",
    ", each value of @xmath0 is associated with different calculus rules .",
    "for this reason , in most physical literature , stratonovich prescription is preferred , because it enables `` normal '' rules of derivation and integration . despite the hnggi - klimontovich convention being the only one which guarantees the convergence to the termodynamic equilibrium",
    ", calculations can be particularly cumbersome in this interpretation .",
    "however , if we prefer to work in any other different fixed prescription , and we insist in modeling a physical system which converges to boltzmann s equilibrium , we need to modify equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) .",
    "it is done by adding a `` spurious drift force ''  @xcite which cancels the last term of equation   ( [ eq.u ] ) .",
    "that is , if we define a new @xmath0-dependent `` potential '' @xmath59 , then , the equilibrium distribution @xmath60 , for any value of @xmath0 .    in this work , we will not adopt this point of view .",
    "we will consider a stochastic process completely defined by fixing @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.langevin ] ) .",
    "thus , the probability distribution @xmath22 flows , at long times , to an @xmath0-dependent equilibrium distribution given by equation  ( [ eq.equilibriumpotential ] ) or alternatively equation  ( [ eq.u ] ) . in this way , we are able to study , in a unique formalism , model systems with general equilibrium distributions that go from boltzmann thermal equilibrium to power - law distributions . a simple example of the latter case is to consider a pure noisy system with @xmath62 . in that case",
    ", the equilibrium distribution is @xmath63 .",
    "we will show that this set of distributions , characterized by asymptotically zero current probability , is consistent with all the usual properties of equilibrium evolution , like , for instance , detailed balance and entropy production .",
    "consider , for instance , the langevin equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) , in the simplest case of @xmath64 .",
    "naively , we could compute the backward evolution of the stochastic variable @xmath6 by just changing the sign on the velocity @xmath65 , in such a way that , for a given noise configuration , the particle turns back on its own feet .",
    "however , the situation is not so simple .",
    "let us look more closely .",
    "consider a time interval @xmath66 .",
    "the forward evolution is obtained by integrating equation ( [ eq.langevin ] ) between the initial and final times @xmath31 and @xmath67 respectively , @xmath68 while the backward evolution is simply obtained by changing the initial and final integration limits , @xmath69 where we use the notation @xmath70 , just to differentiate backward from forward evolution .",
    "if the integrals were `` normal '' integrals , we could use the trivial property @xmath71 . in that case",
    ", there would be no need to differentiate backward and forward variables , since equations  ( [ eq.fwevolution ] ) and  ( [ eq.bwevolution ] ) would be the same equation and @xmath72 .",
    "however , the integrals are wiener integrals and need to be carefully defined . as we saw in the last section , @xmath73 with @xmath74    the time reversal integral",
    "is obtained by changing @xmath75 in equation  ( [ eq.wienerfw ] ) .",
    "the important point is that @xmath76 also depends on @xmath77 .",
    "then , @xmath78 with @xmath79 where @xmath80 was obtained from equation ( [ eq.prescriptionfw ] ) , by replacing @xmath75 or , equivalently , @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the time reversed stochastic evolution is characterized by the transformations @xmath82    in this sense , we say that the prescription @xmath5 is the time reversal conjugate ( trc ) of @xmath0 . then , the post - point hnggi - klimontovich interpretation is the trc of the pre - point it one , and vice versa .",
    "the only _ time reversal invariant prescription _ is the stratonovich one , @xmath3 .",
    "this means that , except for the stratonovich case , the backward and forward stochastic paths do not have the same end points .",
    "this is illustrated in figure ( [ timereversal ] ) , where we compute a `` time - loop '' evolution .",
    "consider we want to compute the evolution of the system starting at @xmath6 , going forward a time interval @xmath83 and , then , turning back in time the same interval @xmath84 .",
    "the forward path in figure ( [ timereversal ] ) can be computed from equation ( [ eq.fwevolution ] ) considering @xmath6 as an initial condition , @xmath85 then , the backward path is computed from equation  ( [ eq.bwevolution ] ) considering @xmath86 as an initial condition @xmath87 replacing equation  ( [ eq.path1 ] ) into  ( [ eq.path2 ] ) , @xmath88 and using equations  ( [ eq.wienerfw ] ) and  ( [ eq.wienerbw ] ) we find @xmath89\\left(w(t_{j+1})-w(t_j)\\right ) .",

    "the forward evolution @xmath93 is performed with a prescription @xmath0 , while the backward trajectory @xmath94 evolves with the time reversal conjugate prescription @xmath5 .",
    "except for the stratonovich convention @xmath3 , @xmath95.,height=245 ]    this fact is reflected in the @xmath0-dependence of the equilibrium stationary state @xmath96 ( equation  ( [ eq.equilibriumpotential ] ) or equation  ( [ eq.u ] ) ) .",
    "while the stationary state in the forward evolution is @xmath97 , the stationary state reached by the backward one is given by @xmath98 , and ( except for the stratonovich prescription ) @xmath99 .",
    "thus , this is not the backward evolution we are interested in . the key point is to determine the backward stochastic process which , at long times , converges to the same equilibrium distribution as the forward one . to obtain it we write the time reversed fokker - planck equation as @xmath100 where we made the substitutions @xmath101 , @xmath81 and @xmath102 in equation  ( [ eq.fp ] ) . in equation  ( [ eq.fpbw ] )",
    ", @xmath103 represents the backward probability distribution of the event @xmath104 .",

    "the complication in this case is that the stationary potential depends on @xmath39 , and the action does not transform as easily as in equation ( [ eq.sts ] ) under time reversal , since @xmath165 .",
    "in order to push forward our analysis of equilibrium properties it is convenient to have a formalism to compute correlations and response functions .",
    "however , the action of equation ( [ eq.sst ] ) and the difficulties introduced by the generalize it calculus ( eq .",
    "( [ eq.chainrule ] ) ) make the functional formalism in @xmath6 quite cumbersome . for this reason it is convenient to introduce auxiliary stochastic variables ( a function @xmath166 and two grassman functions @xmath167 ) extending in this way the functional space of stochastic functions .",
    "the immediate consequence is a formalism that does not depend on the explicit value of @xmath0 , simplifying its mathematical properties . as a by - product , hidden symmetries of the system",
    "can be put in evidence .",
    "these symmetries impose non - perturbative constraints on correlations functions and are related to equilibrium properties of the system like , for instance , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we are interested in the calculation of correlations of functions of the stochastic variable at equal or different times .",
    "for instance , we could want to compute @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is an arbitrary function of @xmath44 , or two point functions @xmath170 .",

    "this equation takes a simpler form if we consider that the system is prepared in equilibrium at @xmath173 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath174 . assuming an ergodic evolution , we consider that @xmath175 for an arbitrary value of @xmath176 . therefore , using equation ( [ eq.a ] ) and equation ( [ eq.ergodic ] ) we can write the mean value as @xmath177 } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where we have extended the time integration from @xmath178 to @xmath179 and , now , there are no more constraints in the functional integration .",
    "it is important to recall that this simpler expression is only possible because we sample the initial condition @xmath180 with the equilibrium distribution @xmath181 .",
    "provided this is satisfied , we can compute any mean value or correlation function from the generating functional @xmath182+\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dt ' j(t ' ) x(t ' ) } \\ ; , \\label{eq.zs}\\ ] ] where @xmath183 is a source with compact domain , that is , it adiabatically goes to zero away from an interval @xmath184 where we will compute the correlation functions .    in this context , any total derivative term in @xmath129 $ ] does not contribute to the dynamics of any observable .",
    "a total derivative term only contributes to a constant prefactor of a correlation function . in this way ,",
    "a system described by equation  ( [ eq.zs ] ) is automatically invariant under time reversal since @xmath185 and @xmath186 differ just in a total time derivative term . on the other hand , if we impose the constraint @xmath187 , the action is truly time reversal invariant @xmath129=\\hat s[x]=\\tilde s$ ] .",
    "again , it is important to observe that this happens because we have prepared the system at equilibrium at some initial time @xmath125 and we are computing correlation functions at later times @xmath188 . for any other initial distribution",
    "we need to go back to equation  ( [ eq.a ] ) to compute mean values .",
    "equation  ( [ eq.zs ] ) can be used to study general correlation and response functions of a white - noise multiplicative stochastic process whose dynamics is driven by equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence of the final equilibrium distribution , the structure of @xmath143 and the fact that for general @xmath0 the usual rules of calculus do not apply , make this method cumbersome .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown  @xcite that , introducing an auxiliary `` bosonic '' variable @xmath166 , and a couple of conjugate grassman variables @xmath189 , we can avoid this inconvenience by alternatively using the generating functional formalism in this extended space .",
    "the generating functional can be cast in the following form , @xmath190 = \\int { \\cal d}x { \\cal d}\\varphi { \\cal d}\\xi { \\cal d}\\bar{\\xi } \\ e^{-s[x,\\varphi,\\xi,\\bar\\xi ] + \\int dt j(t)x(t ) } \\ , \\label{eq.funcionalgenerador}\\ ] ] where the `` action '' @xmath185 is given by @xmath191\\right\\rbrace . \\label{eq.sgrassman}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this action in the extended functional space @xmath192 is completely equivalent to the usual formalism presented in  [ pathintegral ] . in fact ,",
    "functional integrating over grassman variables and over the variable @xmath193 we get the generating functional  ( [ eq.zs ] ) , with the action given by equation  ( [ eq.sfw ] ) .",
    "the advantage of this extended formulation is that it does not depend explicitly of the @xmath0-parameter and then , the calculus rules are the usual ones for any @xmath0 . hence , all the complication of the stochastic calculus associated with the definition of the wiener integral is now codified in the anti - commuting grassman algebra , implying , for instance , that @xmath194 .",
    "of course , the parameter @xmath0 reappears when we need to properly define grassman retarded green s functions .",
    "in fact , equal - time correlations functions are ill - defined , forcing us to set @xmath195 .",
    "one of the advantages of this procedure is that , while the grassman variables are not integrated , we can work out any calculation without explicitly indicate an specific convention .",
    "this is particularly useful to study markovian white - noise processes , where the equilibrium distribution depends on @xmath0 .",
    "this situation is very different from non - markov processes  @xcite , in which @xmath196 .",
    "the time reversal transformation , equation  ( [ eq.t ] ) , has a simpler form in terms of grassman variables , @xmath197 where @xmath198 are the time reversed grassman variables .",
    "there is a subtlety in these transformations which involves the extremal values of the grassman variables . while @xmath199 , the time reversed variables satisfy @xmath200 .",
    "this fact has no importance at all when computing correlation functions . however , it is relevant to analyze entropy production and other relations that depend on total derivatives .",
    "the real advantage of the grassman representation is that almost any important symmetry becomes a linear transformation .",
    "it is simple to check that , in this representation , @xmath201 and @xmath202 then , the entropy production @xmath203 , associated with each trajectory , is given by @xmath204 we see that , in the extended space of trajectories @xmath205 , the entropy production associated with each trajectory is not zero .",
    "this is due to the apparently extra degrees of freedom introduced by the grassman variables .",
    "on the other hand , upon functional integration we have that @xmath206 due to fermionic number conservation and the total entropy production is zero , as it should be in an equilibrium evolution .",
    "this opens the interesting possibility of interpreting an entropy production as a spontaneous breaking of fermionic phase ( gauge ) invariance like , for instance , in superconducting phase transition .",
    "this effect can not happen in our example of one stochastic variable , but in multiple variables systems  @xcite , there are quartic interactions between grassman variables opening this attractive possibility .",
    "it is interesting to compute the linear response of the system to an external perturbation . to see this , we slightly perturb the system out of equilibrium @xmath207 and compute the dynamic susceptibility @xmath208 introducing  ( [ eq.perturb ] ) into  ( [ eq.sgrassman ] ) and computing equation  ( [ eq.chi ] ) we find @xmath209 in the case of additive noise , where @xmath210 , the response function has the simpler form , @xmath211 .",
    "for this reason , the auxiliary function @xmath166 is usually called the response variable . however , for multiplicative noise , the response is more complex since involves , not only correlations functions of @xmath11 , but also contributions from the grassman sector of the model .",
    "this is a direct consequence of multiplicative white - noise since a variation of the `` external '' potential is modifying the fluctuations properties of the system .",
    "this means that the susceptibility explicitly depends on @xmath0 . from equation  ( [ eq.response ] ) , it is immediate to recognize a _",
    "`` natural response variable '' _ @xmath212 in such a way that , @xmath213 we will show that @xmath214 has a key role in the supersymmetric formulation of the model .",
    "the path integral formalism is useful to make evident symmetries of the stochastic process .",
    "for instance , the action given by eq.([eq.sgrassman ] ) is invariant under the transformation , @xmath215 where @xmath216 is an anticommuting parameter .",
    "this nilpotent transformation ( @xmath217 ) is the famous brs  @xcite symmetry , discovered in the context of quantization of gauge theories . in the present context",
    ", it simply enforces probability conservation , @xmath218 .",
    "there is another set of important symmetries related with equilibrium properties which is called supersymmetry . to display it explicitly , it is convenient to work with the natural response variable introduced in equation ( [ eq.naturalresponsevariable ] ) .",
    "therefore , we make in equations ( [ eq.funcionalgenerador ] ) and ( [ eq.sgrassman ] ) the funcional change of variables @xmath219 , defined by @xmath220 the last two transformations make the jacobian trivial , @xmath221 , since @xmath222 and the fermionic measure reads @xmath223 .    the generating functional is then given by @xmath190 = \\int { \\cal d}x { \\cal d}\\tilde\\varphi { \\cal d}\\eta { \\cal d}\\bar{\\eta } \\",

    ", this action written in the space @xmath226 seems to be more complex than the preceding one .",
    "however , these new physical variables can be rearranged in order to explicitly display susy .",
    "first , it is convenient to write @xmath10 and @xmath11 in terms of two `` potentials '' , @xmath52 and @xmath227 , defined as follows @xmath228 then , we collect the variables @xmath229 , in the definition of the superfield @xmath230 where we have introduced two `` temporal '' grassman variables @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "the generating functional , equation  ( [ eq.seta ] ) , can be re - written in terms of @xmath233 as @xmath190 = \\int { \\cal d}\\phi \\",

    "the action  ( [ eq.ssusy ] ) , when written in components form , is completely equivalent to equation  ( [ eq.sgrassman ] ) or , after integration of the grassman variables , to equation  ( [ eq.stilde ] ) , as it is shown in the appendix .",

    "the first equation relates the physical linear response of the system with the grassman two - point correlation function . since the physical response is causal , _",

    ", obtaining @xmath269 using the equilibrium time translations invariance of the correlation function @xmath270 , this identity becomes @xmath271 which , bearing causality in mind , can be rewritten as @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the heaviside step function .",

    "it is very interesting to note that extensions of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , for out - of - equilibrium steady states , can be formulated  @xcite .",
    "a natural arising question is whether a related susy exists for these out - of - equilibrium states .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of equilibrium properties of a _",
    "markovian multiplicative white - noise stochastic process_. the stochastic process was modeled in its simplest version of a single stochastic variable , by means of the langevin equation  ( [ eq.langevin ] ) , defined by a drift term @xmath10 and a diffusion function @xmath11 .",
    "we have completed the definition of the stochastic differential equation by using the _ generalized stratonovich convention _ , characterized by a parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the asymptotic equilibrium distribution was found by solving the stationary fokker - planck equation , imposing an asymptotic zero current probability .",
    "this naturally conduce to an equilibrium potential @xmath49 ( eq .  ( [ eq.u ] ) ) which explicitly depends on @xmath0 . for @xmath4 ( hnggi - klimontovich interpretation ) ,",
    "the potential coincides with the classical deterministic one , @xmath52 , in agreement with the boltzmann distribution for thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , for any other convention , the equilibrium potential is more general , including , for instance , power - law distributions .",
    "thus , the definition of equilibrium in the stochastic dynamical sense not necessarily coincides with the thermodynamical equilibrium concept . we have shown that , even for this generalized definition of equilibrium , the system satisfies the usual equilibrium properties such as detailed balance , microscopic reversibility and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "time reversal properties of the stochastic process are quite interesting .",
    "we have shown that , if the forward stochastic trajectory evolves with a definite value of @xmath0 , the time reversed trajectory evolves with the conjugated prescription @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , in order to have a unique equilibrium distribution , the definition of time reversed stochastic process is given by the transformation  ( [ eq.t ] ) , where we need to change not only the velocity sign , but also the prescription and the drift force .    we have shown that ,",
    "using the equilibrium potential @xmath164 and the time reversal transformation of equation  ( [ eq.t ] ) , the stochastic process satisfies detailed balance relations for any value of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is convenient to note that , in equation  ( [ eq.detailedbalance ] ) , the forward transition probability is not equal to the backward one , except for the stratonovich convention @xmath3 , where forward and backward trajectories coincide .",
    "we have also shown that , if the initial and final states of a finite time evolution are prepared in equilibrium , the entropy production of each stochastic trajectory vanishes for arbitrary prescriptions , verifying the related principle of microscopic reversibility . in order to show these properties ,",
    "we have used the path integral representation of the stochastic process , where the central object is the hole stochastic trajectory . also , we were forced to intensively use an @xmath0-generalized it calculus , summarized in the @xmath0-dependent `` chain rule '' of equation  ( [ eq.chainrule ] ) .    related with equilibrium properties ,",
    "there are hidden symmetries in the stochastic process that can be better analyzed in the path integral approach , formulated in an extended functional space composed of commutative as well as anti - commutative grassman variables .",
    "the advantage of this formulation is that it is prescription independent .",
    "that is , ambiguities in the definition of the multiplicative stochastic processes can be understood , not as a continuum limit ambiguity , but as a necessity to define equal time grassman green s functions . then",
    ", provided the grassman variables are not integrated out , it is not necessary to fix any prescription . in this way , we can use ordinary calculus rules , but instead we need to work with anti - commuting variables . in some sense , all the complexity of the it calculus is codified in the grassman algebra in this formulation .    in this context , we have computed the entropy for each stochastic trajectory ( in the extended space ) and we have shown that it is not zero , but proportional to a time derivative of the grassman variables density @xmath275 ( equation  ( [ eq.entropy ] ) ) .",
    "this is due to the extra degrees of freedom we have added to extend the functional space .",
    "however , integrating over the grassman variables , we immediately recognize that the entropy production is zero , as it should be for an equilibrium evolution .",
    "interestingly , this cancellation is due to `` _ fermionic number conservation _ '' , in other words , due to the invariance under phase transformations .",
    "this allows us to speculate about the very attractive possibility of interpreting an out - of - equilibrium evolution , _ i.  e.  _ , a non - zero entropy production , as a consequence of a gauge symmetry breaking , very similar with a superconducting transition . of course",
    ", this can not happen in our present example , since we only have one stochastic variable and , consequently , the grassman variables are not - interacting .",
    "nevertheless , in multiple variable systems , quartic terms in the grassman variables are certainly possible .",
    "another interesting symmetry which appears in this formulation is supersymmetry ( susy ) , expressed as a linear transformation , mixing commuting as well as anti - commuting variables .",
    "we have presented a supersymmetric covariant representation of the stochastic process .",
    "while this representation was known for additive processes and multiplicative non - markov processes , the present case of _ markovian multiplicative white noise _ was quite difficult to treat due to the different prescriptions available to define it , connected by a time reversal transformation . in this representation ,",
    "the non - trivial time reversal transformation is represented by a simple linear transformation .",
    "the difficulty of the time conjugated prescriptions are confined to boundary conditions , irrelevant in the computation of correlation functions .",
    "using this susy covariant formalism we have analyzed two - point ward - takahashi identities .",
    "one of them relates linear responses and fluctuations .",
    "we have shown that , while the linear response function and fluctuations are @xmath0-dependent , they satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for arbitrary values of the prescription @xmath0 . therefore , similar to the additive case",
    ", supersymmetry is a consequence of equilibrium evolution , even thought we have different equilibrium evolutions for different prescriptions .    summarizing",
    ", we have presented a compact path integral formalism to deal with _",
    "markovian multiplicative white - noise _ systems , independently of the prescription used to define the wiener integral . in its supersymmetric covariant form",
    ", it automatically encodes equilibrium properties .",
    "therefore , it is very appropriate to organize perturbative calculations , since supersymmetry imposes non - perturbative constraints that should be verified at any order of perturbation theory . on the other hand , keeping in checked equilibrium properties , we can safely go forward in the study of out - of - equilibrium fluctuation relations described by this type of stochastic processes .",
