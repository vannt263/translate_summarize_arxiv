    "the problem of heat conduction is a well - studied field .",
    "more than two centuries ago , joseph fourier summarized the behavior of heat conduction by the law that bears his name .",
    "this law describes phenomenologically that the heat current is proportional to the temperature gradient .",
    "the detailed atomistic theories of heat conduction appeared only much later . for heat conduction in gas ,",
    "the simple kinetic theory gives the result @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is specific heat , @xmath5 is average velocity and @xmath6 is mean - free path .",
    "peierls theory of heat conduction in insulating solids @xcite is a classic on this subject .",
    "these early theories deal with mostly the relevant three dimensions .",
    "it turns out that low dimensional systems are more interesting and in some sense strange .",
    "an analysis of a simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) harmonic oscillator model shows @xcite that there is no well - defined temperature gradient , the thermal conductivity diverges with system sizes as @xmath7 or @xmath1 , depending on the boundary conditions .",
    "there is a general argument , for momentum conserving systems , that the thermal conduction in 1d is necessarily divergent @xcite .",
    "there have been many analytical and numerical studies of 1d heat conduction ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for review ) .",
    "we ll mention some of the most relevant papers to current work .",
    "the work of lepri _ et al _ @xcite by mode - coupling theory and molecular dynamics suggests a divergent thermal conductivity exponent of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 for a 1d chain model with fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) interactions .",
    "mode - coupling theory is usually applied in the dynamics of liquids @xcite .",
    "the first use of this theory in the context of heat conduction appears only recently , mostly due to lepri and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "perverzev analyzed the same problem with the peierls theory for phonon gas and gave the same conclusion of @xmath8 exponent @xcite .",
    "the result of @xmath8 is also supported by numerical simulation from several groups @xcite .",
    "these results are supposed to be universal to some extent .",
    "however , it is challenged by a different result of @xmath10 by narayan and ramaswamy @xcite , based on fluctuating hydrodynamics and renormalization group analysis . the numerical result for this 1/3 law is not convincing , as for the same model",
    " the hard - particle gas model  some obtained 1/3 @xcite , while others obtained different value 1/4 @xcite .",
    "but for the fpu model , there is no good evidence for an exponent of 1/3 @xcite .",
    "when momentum conservation is broken such as the one with on - site potential , the heat conduction can become normal again like the frenkel - kontorova model @xcite and the @xmath11 model @xcite .    in order to understand the underlying microscopic dynamical mechanism of the fourier law , a different class of models  billiard channels ",

    "various exponent values are found in such systems .",
    "thus , it is believed that a universal constant does not exist at all . instead",
    ", the divergent ( convergent ) exponent of the thermal conductivity is found related to the power of super ( sub ) diffusion @xcite .",
    "besides the theoretical significance of heat conduction research in low dimensional systems , it is also of practical importance .",
    "recent development of nanotechnology will enable us to manufacture devices with feature sizes at molecular level .",
    "the understanding of heat conduction mechanism will allow us to control and manipulate heat current , and eventually to design novel thermal devices with certain function @xcite . to this end",
    ", more realistic physical models are necessary . among many others , nanotubes and polymer chains are most promising .",
    "there have been a number of numerical works to compute the thermal conductivity of the carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "recent molecular dynamics ( md ) study of carbon nanotubes with realistic interaction potential suggested a divergent thermal conductivity for narrow diameter tubes @xcite .",
    "the quantum effect of such systems is also very interesting @xcite .",

    "most of the previous studies considered only strictly 1d models , with the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model as the most representative .",
    "the strictly 1d models may not be applicable to real systems such as the nanotubes .",
    "real systems of nanotubes or wires live in three - dimensional space . the added transverse motion and the flexibility of the tube at long length scales will certainly scatter phonons , and thus should have a profound effect on thermal transport .    while a direct simulation of a realistic system such as a polyethelene chain with empirical force fields such as that in refs .",
    "@xcite or nanotube with tersoff potential @xcite is possible , we think it is useful to consider a simplified model which captures one of the important features of the real systems  transverse degrees of freedom . therefore we propose to study the following chain model in two dimensions @xcite : @xmath16 where the position vector @xmath17 and momentum vector @xmath18 are two - dimensional ; @xmath19 is lattice constant .",

    ", we have used very small @xmath442 to @xmath443 so that its effect should be comparable to error caused by finite time - step @xmath444 .",
    "we also used large @xmath445 as a way of simulating a slightly different model to study the robustness of the results .",
    "we solve the system of equations @xcite @xmath446 where @xmath447 is the total force acting on the @xmath232-th particle , @xmath448 and @xmath449 obey the equation @xmath450 where @xmath451 and @xmath452 are the temperatures of the two heat baths at the ends .",
    "the summation is over the particles belonging to the heat bath .",
    "we have used 4 particles for the nos - hoover heat baths , with extra first two and last two particles at fixed positions .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath453 is taking to be 1 .",
    "for the central part , we used a second - order symplectic algorithm ( or equivalently , the velocity verlet algorithm ) , while for the heat - bath , we used a simple difference scheme accurate to second order in @xmath444 for @xmath454 .",
    "although the total energy ( hamiltonian ) is no longer a conserved quantity when the heat - bath is introduced , the above equation still has a conserved quantity of similar character : @xmath455 this quantity can be used to monitor the stability of the algorithm .    since we run for very long time steps of @xmath456 to @xmath457 , it is essential that the algorithm is stable over extended period of time .",
    "even with a symplectic algorithm , stability is not guaranteed by merely taking small @xmath444 @xmath458 .",
    "thus , we adjusted the conserved quantity , eq .",
    "( [ conserved ] ) , to its starting value after certain number of steps .",
    "temperature of @xmath232-th particle , @xmath459 vs scaled position , @xmath460 , for data set e with @xmath461 ( plus ) , 256 ( dash line ) , and 1024 ( solid line ) . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig - temperature - scaling ] , we observe that good temperature profiles are established .",
    "due to relatively large temperature difference between low and high temperature heat baths , and perhaps also due to the nature of heat baths , the profile is not linear .",
    "however , the scaling with @xmath1 is approximately obeyed .",
    "@xmath462 vs @xmath1 for different parameters @xmath463 . set c : @xmath464 ,",
    "the chain is compressed to have an average distance between particle @xmath465 ; set g : ( 10 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 0 ) ; set i : ( 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.2 ) ; set k : ( 0.5 , 1.2 , 2 , 0.4 ) ; set l : ( 25 , 1 , 1.5 , 0.2 ) .",
    "all of the sets have @xmath32 , mass @xmath31 , and lattice constant @xmath169 .",
    "the number indicates the slope of least - squares fit . ]",
    "in addition to the thermal conductance results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig - jl - extra ] gives additional data for variety of parameters .",
    "one of the aim of these additional runs is to check the robustness of the @xmath10 power law for thermal conductance .",
    "it is found in ref  @xcite for set e exponent @xmath466 .",
    "this is an excellent confirmation of the mode - coupling theory .",
    "we note that at parameter set @xmath365 , the @xmath10 law is not destroyed by introducing large @xmath445 .",
    "thus we believe that the @xmath10 law is not specific to the potential used in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the fermi - pasta - ulam model with transverse motion was studied @xcite and result is also consistent with the @xmath10 power law .    at low temperatures for set i and c",
    ", we appear to observe exponent of 0.4 .",
    "what is particularly interesting for set c is that the chain is compressed to an average distance of 1.5 from the equilibrium distance of 2 .",
    "the behavior is not changed much comparing to uncompressed chain . set g and",
    "l represent very large angular coupling @xmath26 .",
    "we note that @xmath467 corresponds to a situation that equilibrium can not be established .",
    "as @xmath26 becomes larger , the equilibration becomes increasingly difficult . in ref .",
    "@xcite we reported a logarithmic behavior for @xmath468 ( set b ) .",
    "this logarithmic behavior does not maintain when @xmath26 is increased further .",
    "the exponent @xmath469 for set l and g is closed to 1/2 .",
    "this may be related the results of disordered harmonic chain .",
    "lepri _ et al _ first introduced mode - coupling theory into the problem of heat conduction in low dimensional systems to interpret the md results qualitatively .",
    "we have developed the theory further by introducing a ` full theory ' and effective parameters for theory .",
    "the full theory is solved numerically . at this level of approximation",
    ", we find that mode - coupling theory gives excellent prediction on a quantitative level .",
    "the longitudinal damping ( decay rate ) @xmath259 agrees with md data with few per cents of deviation .",
    "the mode - coupling theory somewhat overestimated the transverse damping @xmath260 by a factor of two to three .",
    "the full theory assumes that the damping function ( memory kernel ) @xmath470 $ ] is an explicit function of two variables , @xmath79 and @xmath167 . in a simple mode - coupling theory ,",
    "we assume @xmath470 \\approx ( 2\\pi k/(na))^2 \\nu[z]$ ] , valid for small @xmath471 .",
    "the simple theory is computationally efficient , and contains essential asymptotic features , i.e. , @xmath264 and @xmath472 . through detailed comparison between md and mode - coupling theory on memory kernel , decay of the modes , the time - dependent correlation functions , green - kubo integrand , and finally the finite - size conductance",
    ", we have strong evidence that the mode - coupling theory is correct , and it captures the essential features of the system .",
    "we have used parameter set e as the main data set for comparison .",
    "the reason for choosing this particular set of parameters is that it gives the cleanest power - law behavior .",
    "other parameters will be either qualitatively similar , or crossovers will be observed .",
    "in fact mode - coupling theory naturally predicts crossover , due to the presence of @xmath316 term . when this term is dominant , or the transverse effect",
    "can be neglected , we should see behavior of @xmath473 .",
    "thus we feel that the controversy of the result of lepri _ et al _ @xcite and that of narayan and ramaswamy ( @xmath474 ) @xcite can be reconciled within the current mode - coupling theory .",
