    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) has been traditionally interpreted to be an invariant probability density distribution function ( e.g. kroupa 2001 , 2002 ; bastian et al .",
    "recent observational evidence has however ruled out this simple interpretation in that low - density regions have been found to be lacking the massive stars they ought to have produced given the large number of stars formed ( kirk & myers 2011 ; hsu et al .",
    "the mass function of young star clusters has also been shown to not be a probability density distribution function ( pflamm - altenburg et al .",
    "2013 ; kroupa 2014 ) .",
    "furthermore , several independent observational evidences have been put forward in the last few years , showing that the galaxy - wide imf varies with star formation rate ( sfr ) ( e.g. hoversten & glazebrook 2008 ; gunawardhana et al .",
    "2011 ; cappellari et al . 2012",
    "; conroy & van dokkum 2012 ) and probably varies also within a single galaxy ( dutton et al .",
    "2013 ) .    a comprehensive theory , attempting to explain the evolution of the imf within galaxies is the so - called integrated galactic imf ( igimf , i.e. the galaxy - wide imf ) theory ( kroupa & weidner 2003 ; weidner & kroupa 2005 ; see the recent review by kroupa et al . 2013 ) .",
    "in two previous papers ( recchi et al .",
    "2009 ; recchi et al .",
    "2014 ) we have investigated the effect of the igimf on the abundance ratios ( global and of individual stars ) in galaxies .",
    "one paper ( calura et al .",
    "2010 ) has been devoted to the study of the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood by adopting the ( sfr - dependent ) igimf formulation .",
    "eventually , numerical hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies with a variable igimf have been pioneered , too ( ploeckinger et al . 2014 ) .",
    "it remains to be shown that the igimf theory is consistent with the observed mass - metallicity ( mz ) relation in galaxies ( see e.g. lee et al .",
    "2006 ; kirby et al .",
    "2013 ) and with the more general fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr , see mannucci et al .",
    "2010 ; lara - lpez et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we build on a previous attempt ( kppen et al .",
    "2007 ) and solve the equations of the so - called `` simple model '' but within the framework of the igimf theory , i.e. we assume that the galaxy - wide imf depends on the sfr and on the metallicity of the parent galaxy .",
    "analytical and semi - analytical calculations of the chemical evolution of galaxies based on simple models are nowadays quite popular , as they enlighten in a simple way complex correlations among galaxies ( spitoni et al . 2010 ; dayal et al .",
    "2013 ; lilly et al .",
    "2013 ; birrer et al .",
    "2014 ; pipino et al .",
    "it is worth remarking that all these authors consider invariant imfs whereas , as explained above , there is significant observational evidence for imf variations among different galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is important and timely to understand how to modify the formalism of the simple model to take into account imf variations .",
    "this is indeed the main aim of the present paper .",
    "it is also worth stressing that , although this paper is based on the igimf theory , other theories of imf variation have been put forward in the literature ( e.g. larson 1998 ; padoan & nordlund 2002 ; hopkins 2013 .",
    "see also martinelli & matteucci 2000 ) .",
    "the formalism developed in this paper can be applied equally well to these imf theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : igimf ] we recall the main assumptions of the igimf theory and describe the way in which this theory has been implemented in the present work . in sect .",
    "[ sec : simple ] we describe the simple models of chemical evolution  a simplified tool to describe the evolution of the metallicity of a galaxy .",
    "in sect . [ sec : cbrev ] we re - interpret the so - called closed - box model within the framework of the igimf theory , i.e. we relax the hypothesis that the imf is universal . similarly , in sect .",
    "[ sec : lbrev ] we re - interpret simple models of chemical evolution with outflows and infall and consider again variations of the imf between galaxies and within galaxies . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] the results of this work are discussed and some conclusions are drawn . in a companion paper ( recchi et al .",
    "2014 ; hereafter paper ii ) , we will apply this methodology to the study of the mass - metallicity relation in tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs ) .",
    "the igimf theory is based on the assumption that stars in a galaxy are formed in space - time correlated entities called embedded star clusters ( lada & lada 2003 ) , thereby accounting naturally for the above mentioned results by kirk & myers ( 2011 ) , hsu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and pflamm - altenburg et al .",
    "the notion underlying the igimf theory lies in the conjecture that the freshly born galaxy - wide stellar population is the sum of all local star - formation activity and that this activity occurs in the density maxima of molecular cloud cores by being made up of embedded groups or clusters of stars on a spacial scale of less than a  pc ( marks & kroupa 2012 ) .",
    "the mass distribution of these is equivalent to the mass function of embedded clusters which do not need to be gravitationally bound upon expulsion of their residual gas ( lada et al .",

    "it also qualitatively reproduces the trend of decreasing @xmath23 with increasing sfr observed by gunawardhana et al .",

    "a seventh axiom has been introduced ( weidner et al . 2013 ) : the exponent @xmath27 of the ecmf is not a constant but it varies with the sfr according to : @xmath28 axiom  7 implies the mass function of embedded clusters to be top - heavy in star bursts .",
    "weidner et al . ( 2013 ) explored also the possibility that the mass of the smallest embedded cluster depends on the sfr , thus partially relaxing the fifth axiom above .",
    "they showed however that this assumption produces results almost indistinguishable from the results obtained with axiom 7 , thus we will not further consider this hypothesis .",
    "a class of galactic chemical evolution models , commonly dubbed as simple models , admit analytical solutions .",
    "they are thus quite useful and easy - to - apply diagnostics for the evolution of galaxies ( see spitoni et al . 2010 ; lilly et al .",
    "2013 ; pipino et al .",
    "2014 ; see also the introduction ) , thus it is useful to understand advantages and limitations of this formalism .",
    "the basic assumptions behind the simple models are ( see tinsley 1980 ; maeder 1992 ) :    1 .",
    "stars more massive than a fixed mass ( usually 1 m@xmath5 ) die instantaneously .",
    "stars less massive than this threshold live forever .",
    "this assumption ( instantaneous recycling approximation ) allows us to neglect the lifetime of single stars in what follows .",
    "2 .   the gas is well mixed at any time . 3 .",
    "the flow rates ( infall and outflow ) are proportional to the sfr @xmath29 .",
    "the imf is universal : it is independent of time and it is the same in all galaxies . 5 .   the yields and the remnant masses are functions of the stellar mass alone .",
    "this assumption ( together with the universality of the imf ) implies that the quantities : @xmath30 are constant . here , @xmath31 is the adopted ( fixed , for the moment ) imf , @xmath32 is the remnant mass of the star with initial mass @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the mass - fraction of newly synthesised metals by the star of initial mass @xmath33 . according to this terminology , the total amount of heavy elements released by a star of initial mass @xmath33 , initial metallicity @xmath35 and remnant mass @xmath32 is @xmath36 , i.e. it includes newly synthesised heavy elements but also metals present in the stars at birth and not processed . the quantity @xmath37 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ryz ] represents thus the fraction of a stellar population not locked into long - living ( dark ) remnants and @xmath38 represents the ratio between the mass of heavy elements ejected by a stellar generation and the mass locked up in remnants .",

    "\\label{eq : simplechevsol}\\ ] ] this solution expresses the gas - phase metallicity of a galaxy , as a function of the mass fraction @xmath53 . the time dependence of this relation is hidden in the time dependence of @xmath53 , which in turn depends on how quickly the gas is consumed to form stars ( i.e. it depends on the sfr ) and on the flows in and out of the galaxy .",
    "hence , to have a complete picture of the evolution of the galaxy , we need also some assumption concerning the sfr . in what follows we will assume that the sfr depends on the available gas reservoir through the simple law @xmath54 i.e. we assume here that the sfr is linearly proportional to the gas mass and that this proportionality constant is an invariant quantity .",
    "this equation also implies that the gas consumption timescale of a galaxy is always about 3 gyr .",
    "notice that many studies of the chemical evolution of galaxies suggest that the star formation efficiency increases with the mass of the galaxy ( e.g. matteucci 1994 ; pipino & matteucci 2004 ) .",
    "these studies are however based on invariant imfs and indeed matteucci ( 1994 ) showed that a variable imf or a variable star formation efficiency might produce similar results . in the framework of the igimf , pflamm - altenburg & kroupa ( 2009 ) showed that the gas consumption time - scale is similar in all galaxies , irrespective of their masses , and it is indeed of the order of 3 gyr .",
    "we consider also the average metallicity @xmath55 of the stars in a galaxy . a simple way of calculating this quantity is : @xmath56 this expression represents the mass - weighted average of the metallicities of all the stellar populations ever born in the galaxy ( see pagel 1997 ) .",
    "a more accurate definition of @xmath55 would involve a luminosity - weighted average , but it has been shown that these two averages do not differ much ( e.g. recchi et al . 2009 ) .    a solution can be found also in the presence of metal - enhanced galactic outflows ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : lbrev ] ) .",

    "2008 ) . from the given solution",

    "for instance , setting @xmath57 one obtains the well - known solution of the closed - box model @xmath58 a @xmath44 is in the denominator , hence @xmath59 diverges as @xmath60 .",
    "the previous sentence might thus look suspicious .",
    "the fact is that also the expression within the curly brackets tends to zero for @xmath61 .",
    "take @xmath62 ; the solution reduces to @xmath63        \\simeq \\frac{y_{\\rm z}}{\\lambda}\\left [ 1 -          \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right)^{-\\lambda}\\right],\\label{eq : foot}\\ ] ] where we have taken the limit for small @xmath44 in the second equality .",

    "the consequence is that the time evolution of the metallicity is always the same , independent of the mass of the galaxy .",
    "consequently , these models can not reproduce the observed mz relation .",
    "a viable solution is to assume that small galaxies can experience galactic winds , due to their shallow potential wells .",
    "observations show indeed that mass - loading factors in galactic winds are larger in small galaxies ( martin 2005 ) and theoretical investigations confirm this finding ( hopkins et al .",

    "we have checked that our results depend little on the chosen metallicity , although larger initial metallicities tend to produce slightly higher yields .",

    "[ eq : sol1 ] in the case @xmath95 , @xmath96 ( i.e. no differential winds , no infall ) .",
    "as already mentioned , it is to be expected that low - mass galaxies are much more affected by galactic winds than are more - massive ones , i.e. we expect @xmath45 to decrease as the galactic mass increases . a simple functional form satisfying this condition is to decrease with increasing total ( baryons plus dark matter ) galactic mass . if we assume for simplicity a constant ratio between dark matter and baryonic mass , a correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath97 as in eq .",

    "[ fig : lambda_comp ] do not fully overlap .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the outflow rates in spitoni et al .",
    "( 2010 ) are much larger than the ones adopted in this study .",
    "this is due to the fact that the reduction of the metallicity at low masses is , according to the igimf theory , largely due to the steepening of the imf slope at large stellar masses in galaxies with small sfrs .",
    "moreover , we assume @xmath104 , based on the results of the chemo - dynamical simulations of recchi & hensler ( 2013 ) .    the mz relation obtained with leaky box models with this dependence of @xmath45 with @xmath97 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : mz_w ] .",
    "the fit with observations is very good",
    ". it could be better if we better fine - tune the relation @xmath105 but this is not the main aim of the paper .",
    "the igimf theory ( kroupa et al . 2013 ) predicts a coupling between some properties of a galaxy ( the sfr and the metallicity ) and the imf .",
    "since the imf in turn strongly affects the dynamical evolution of the galaxy , the feedback between galaxy evolution and imf is difficult and the fully complexity of a variable imf has not been yet included in hydrodynamical simulations ( but see bekki 2013 ; ploeckinger et al . 2014 ; recchi 2014 ) .",
    "even the here treated approach based on the so - called `` simple model of chemical evolution '' leads to implicit integral equations that must be solved iteratively .",
    "we note in passing that the dependence of the imf on the metallicity is well established theoretically , as low - metallicity gas cools less efficiently and self - gravitating clumps are more resilient to fragmentation .",
    "this leads to the formation of dense cores of higher mass .",
    "for this reason , the imf is supposed to be extremely biased towards massive stars if the metallicity is smaller than @xmath106 10@xmath80 z@xmath5 ( schneider et al .",
    "also the dependence of the imf on the sfr is nowadays observationally well established ( hoversten & glazebrook 2008 ; meurer et al .",
    "2009 ; gunawardhana et al .",
    "2011 ; kroupa 2014 ) , and the igimf theory is the only existing computable access accounting for these observations ( weidner et al . 2013 ) .",
    "thus , in spite of the inherent complexity , detailed simulations of galaxy evolution based on variable imfs need to be performed . with this paper , we aimed at showing in a simple setting how to take into account imf variations in models of the chemical evolution of galaxies ( see also martinelli & matteucci 2000 ; calura et al .",
    "the method outlined here can be used in order to extend analytical studies of the evolution of galaxies based on simple models of chemical evolution ( e.g. spitoni et al .",
    "2010 ; lilly et al .",
    "2013 ; pipino et al .",
    "we described how the solution of the simple model differs from the standard , textbook analytical solutions of the simple model .",
    "we also showed ( building on previous results of kppen et al .",
    "2007 ) that the igimf theory naturally leads to a mass - metallicity relation .",
    "in fact , low - mass galaxies are characterized on average by smaller sfrs . according to the igimf theory",
    ", a low sfr leads to a steep , top - light imf , in which the production of heavy elements by massive stars is extremely limited .",
    "more massive galaxies instead produce many more massive stars because of the higher level of sfr , hence the attained present - day metallicity is larger .",
    "we outline here once again that the main aim of the paper was not to provide the ultimate explanation for the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "many detailed theoretical studies have been performed on this subject ( see e.g. matteucci & chiosi 1983 ; tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ; finlator & dav 2008 ; calura et al . 2009",
    "; peeples & shankar 2011 ; yin et al .",
    "2011 among many others ) . as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : mz ] , the mz relation obtained with the igimf theory does not fit well the data and assumptions about flow rates are required in order to obtain a good fit .",
    "nevertheless it is important to show that @xmath107 the igimf theory ( as well as any other theory according to which the imf is top - heavier in more massive systems ) naturally accounts for the mz relation ; @xmath108 even within the igimf formalism , flow rates ( infall and outflows ) remain crucial ingredients for the evolution of galaxies ; @xmath109 the intensity of the galactic wind must be assumed to be inversely proportional to the initial gaseous mass of the model galaxy , in accordance with observations and theoretical studies .",
    "the outflow rates are however considerably smaller than the ones needed to reproduce the mz relation in models with invariant imfs such as the one of spitoni et al .",

    "this methodology will be applied to the study of the mass - metallicity relation in dark - matter - free tidal dwarf galaxies . at the same time , efforts are ongoing to model by means of hydrodynamical codes the full chemo - dynamical evolution of galaxies within the igimf theory , in order to assess the reliability of the results obtained in this paper .",
