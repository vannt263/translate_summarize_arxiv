    "the problem of targeted vaccination has typically been formulated as follows . given some knowledge of the contact network , identify the individuals that are potentially most important for disease spreading . to carry out a targeted vaccination campaign , one would first need to gather information about the contact network , then use this information to vaccinate ( or otherwise reduce the impact of the important individuals ) .",
    "there are thus three major costs involved in such an endeavor : the cost of the disease itself ( that we can use as our base unit ) , the cost of gathering the information about the network @xmath0 ( in units of the cost of a person getting the disease ) and the cost of vaccinating @xmath1 .",
    "we can thus evaluate the cost efficiency of a vaccination protocol by measuring the net saving @xmath2 per person in units of the cost of sick individuals @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the expected outbreak sizes ( number of individual who had the disease after it became extinct ) respectively without and with using vaccinations , @xmath6 is the number of individuals , @xmath7 is the fraction of individuals to vaccinate and @xmath8 is the number of inquiries needed to obtain information ( which can depend on the specific vaccination protocol , @xmath7 and the graph @xmath9 representing the network ) .    the goal of this paper is to address the trade - off between effectiveness and efficiency of vaccination protocols .",
    "we perform the study on several real - life data sets and on the configuration model , which is a method to generate synthetic uncorrelated random networks given a degree sequence .",
    "the advantage of the configuration model is in its simplicity , and that infections spreading and vaccination protocols on such networks and their generalized versions have been studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the simplest vaccination protocol is just to vaccinate random individuals , the _ random _ protocol , which often serves as a baseline in the literature , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite . an important paper by cohen , havlin and ben avraham  @xcite proposed a more effective _ acquaintance _ vaccination . in their approach ,",
    "one also starts by randomly selected individuals , but does not vaccinate these , rather , asks them to name someone they met ( in such a way that contagion could occurred ) . in an uncorrelated network , the probability of meeting a person of degree @xmath10 in such an approach , is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "it is important to vaccinate high - degree nodes , not only because they have more people to spread the disease to , but also more people to get the disease from .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the fraction of population that must be vaccinated in order to prevent a global outbreak .",
    "formally , as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and we will use an upper index for @xmath11 to denote a specific vaccination protocol .",
    "it was shown numerically in refs .",
    "@xcite that @xmath14 .",
    "an implicit analytical expression for @xmath15 in uncorrelated networks ( configuration model ) was derived in ref .",
    "similar results were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a more general model of infection spreading , in ref .",
    "@xcite for imperfect vaccine , and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the weighted configuration model , where weights of the edges represent contact probabilities .",
    "a large empirical study based on the 2006 census of the greater toronto area  @xcite suggests that vaccination of top - degree nodes  the _ degree _ vaccination protocol  is most effective .",
    "however , such strategy requires an entire information of the network , which makes it hard to implement . for analytical results on degree - based vaccination and an implicit expression for @xmath16",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper by optimizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) rather that @xmath11 , we confirm that the _ degree _ protocol is never the most efficient one : in all scenarios , the cost of the complete knowledge does not justify the gain in @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the _ acquaintance _ protocol , we consider two strategies , recently developed for quick detection of high - degree nodes : the _ random walk _",
    "strategy  @xcite , and the _ two - step heuristic _ ( _ tsh _ )  @xcite .",
    "we also consider three protocols that require complete knowledge of the network , including vaccinating the top - degree nodes .",
    "see section  [ sec : protocols ] for a complete description of all protocols .",
    "we find ( section  [ sec : num ] ) that the randomized protocols ( _ acquaintance _ , _ random walk _ , _ tsh _ ) outperform the _ random _ protocol as well as the three protocols , which require the knowledge of the entire network . for high vaccination costs and low costs of gathering information , the _ acquaintance _",
    "vaccination is the most cost efficient .",
    "for other parameter values , either _ random walk _ or _ tsh _",
    "are most efficient .    in section  [ sec :",
    "analysis ] , we provide a qualitative analysis of the optimal value of @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi ] ) for different vaccination protocols , based on the configuration model .",
    "the obtained insights correspond well to our findings on the data .",
    "in this section we introduce the methods , data sets and network models we use .",
    "we assume that an infectious disease is spreading over a static contact network represented as a graph @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is the set of @xmath6 vertices representing individuals ; @xmath19 is the set of @xmath20 undirected edges representing pairs of individuals between whom the disease to spread .",
    "the vertices are , at any given time , in one of three states  susceptible ( s ) , infectious ( i ) or recovered ( r ) .",
    "susceptible vertices do not have the disease , but can get it .",
    "infectious vertices have the disease and they can spread it .",
    "recovered vertices do not have the disease and can not get it .",
    "we assume a disease outbreak starts at time @xmath21 . at the beginning",
    "all vertices are susceptible , except a randomly chosen vertex that is infectious .",
    "if an edge consists of one infectious and one susceptible , then the susceptible becomes infectious at rate @xmath22 .",
    "every infectious recovers at rate @xmath23 . in this",
    "setting , an infectious vertex transfers a disease through an edge before getting recovered with probability @xmath24 .",
    "the sir model is essentially determined by the ratio between @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the well - mixed , differential equation version of the sir model , this ratio is called @xmath25 , the actual values of @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "are only needed to calculate the real time to reach the peak prevalence , extinction etc . in this paper , we set @xmath26 which is equivalent to saying that we are measuring the time in units of @xmath27 .",
    "straightforwardly , one can simulate this model by going through all s - i edges and accept an infection with probability @xmath24 .",
    "much more efficient is , however , to perform one infection or recovery event every iteration of the algorithm .",
    "the probability of the next event being an infection is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of edges between infectious and susceptible individuals , and @xmath30 is the prevalence ( number of infectious individuals  @xcite ) .",
    "the time increment since the last iteration is @xmath31 .",
    "thus , to record time ( in units of @xmath27 ) , one adds this amount every iteration to a variable representing time .",
    "if an infection event is not performed , one performs a recovery event . in an infection event",
    ", the s - i edge is chosen randomly among all s - i links . similarly , in case of a recovery event , the infectious individual ( to recover ) is selected uniformly at random among all infectious individuals .    for all contact networks and parameter values ,",
    "we use @xmath32 or more runs of the sir model for averages .",
    "we use @xmath33 and ( as mentioned ) @xmath26 .",
    "we compare the performance of seven vaccination protocols  five of these have been analyzed in the literature , and two are proposed by us in this work ( but derived from a cost - efficient way of finding the highest degree vertices ) .",
    "the vaccination protocols range from simple to complex and use different amount of information about the network .",
    "the simplest way of vaccinating a fraction @xmath7 of a population is to just pick @xmath34 persons uniformly at random . in this case",
    ", we can assume the information cost to be zero as all we need is a list of contact information of the population .",
    "an elegant way of exploiting the network structure to find high - degree individuals to vaccinate is the _ acquaintance _ vaccination scheme by cohen , havlin and ben avraham  @xcite . in the literature",
    "it is often assumed that each individual is sampled a poisson(@xmath7 ) distributed number of times , and each time a sampled individual names one neighbor to vaccinate .",
    "when the neighbor has already been vaccinated , no vaccination occurs and the next individual is sampled randomly .",
    "then , the average fraction of vaccinated individuals @xmath35 is smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "the exact formula for @xmath35 is given e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite . naturally , @xmath35 is close to @xmath7 when @xmath7 is small .",
    "here we assume that when a randomly sampled individual names a contact , which has already been vaccinated , then the individual is asked to name another contact .",
    "we discard the rare cases when all contacts of a random individual have already been vaccinated , and thus assume that @xmath36",
    ". then the information cost of this protocol is @xmath37 , since one needs to make an inquiry to one node for every node that is vaccinated .",
    "if one is willing to spend more effort on mapping out the network , one can do significantly better than the acquaintance vaccination in finding the high - degree vertices .",
    "this is the idea of _ random walk _ vaccination . under this heuristics",
    "one keeps a list of the @xmath34 vertices with highest observed degree that is updated during a random walk of inquiries .",
    "this is based on ref .",
    "@xcite that proposed this method to find high - degree nodes in the world wide web in a cost - efficient way .",
    "to avoid getting stuck in an isolated subgraph , one allows jumps to random nodes .",
    "this model has two parameters .",
    "the first , @xmath38 , sets the jumping probability to @xmath39 .",
    "we use @xmath40 to make the random walker jump , on average , every third step ( following the recommendation from ref .",
    "the second parameter @xmath41 is the number of steps in the random walk , per node on the top list . rather than fixing this parameter",
    ", we will use the value that optimizes @xmath2 .",
    "the cost of this protocol is the number of steps the random walk continues to a neighbor of the present node ( rather than jumping to a random node ) times @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath42 .",
    "we also try a protocol that , like the _ random walk _ in the previous section , was developed to cost - efficiently identify high - degree nodes in social media .",
    "we call it the _ two - step heuristic_. just like _ random walk",
    "_ it has a parameter to tune the amount of information used in the search process  @xcite .",
    "this protocol consist of two stages . in the first stage ,",
    "one randomly chooses @xmath43 nodes and considers a reduced network of these @xmath43 nodes and their neighbors . in the second stage one",
    "measures the exact degrees of the @xmath44 highest - degree nodes of the reduced network . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath45 ( which is not far off the expected optimal parameter setting  @xcite ) .",
    "this gives @xmath46 , and the total information cost @xmath47 .      since both _",
    "random walk _ and _ tsh _ aim at being cost - efficient methods to rank nodes according to their degree , we also use the correct values of the degree ( which could only be obtained by knowing the entire network ) .",
    "the information cost of this protocol is thus @xmath48 .",
    "there are other structures than degree that could be exploited for mitigating disease spreading .",
    "coreness captures , not only the degree of a node , but also increases with the connectedness of a node s neighborhood .",
    "the idea that dense clusters ( `` core groups '' in the epidemiological literature ) are important for disease spreading dates back to ref .",
    "coreness is not the only metrics to capture this property , but a simple and straightforward one .",
    "it is the byproduct of a @xmath10-_core decomposition _ , which is a way to analyze the network by successively removing nodes from it .",
    "specifically , at level @xmath10 , one deletes all nodes with degree @xmath49 .",
    "if nodes get degree @xmath49 during the deletion process , one deletes these too , until all nodes have degrees larger than @xmath10 .",
    "the coreness value of a node is the @xmath10-value when it was deleted .",
    "the coreness as an estimate of importance with respect to disease spreading was proposed by ref .",
    "@xcite . to use it",
    ", one would need to map out the entire network , i.e.  all its @xmath20 edges .",
    "however , in reality , the inquiries will be implemented by node , and it is unreasonable to assume that the cost of an inquiry from a node of degree @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we choose another simplified approach , in which we assume that knowing the complete network takes one inquiry per node , i.e.  the total information cost is @xmath48 .",
    "note that this is a more demanding inquiry , because it requires an individual to list all its neighbors .",
    "still , we use the same cost , meaning the performance of coreness relative to its cost will be slightly exaggerated compared to the above protocols .      finally , we use a yet more elaborate algorithm that , like coreness , requires full information about the network . we stick with the author s rather non - descriptive name _ collective influence _ ( _ ci _ )  @xcite .",
    "it starts by defining a quantity @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the distance ( fewest number of edges in any path ) between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the algorithm proceeds by deleting the node of largest @xmath54 , then recalculating @xmath55 for the reduced network and repeating the procedure until @xmath34 nodes are deleted .",
    "as @xmath56 grows , the ranking stabilizes but the computation time increases .",
    "the choice of @xmath56 is thus a trade - off between speed and precision .",
    "we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and set @xmath57 . just like coreness",
    ", the collective influence needs all the network information .",
    "thus the total cost of information gathering is @xmath48 .",
    "ideally , the underlying network of our study should be as realistic as possible ( given a pathogen ) .",
    "our knowledge of the structure of contact networks is advancing , and there are some datasets available .",
    "we use the ones that record actual contacts between people and disregard those where contacts are inferred from interaction on social media , etc .",
    "@xcite . to better understand how the size of the network , and higher - order structures , affect the performance of the algorithms , it is desirable to have models able to generate contact networks .",
    "we study one of the simplest such models  the configuration model  not because it is able to generate a network with very realistic structure , but because it enables us to compare the result to other studies , in particular analytical ones .",
    "the input to the configuration model is a degree sequence , i.e.  a sequence of desired degrees of the nodes of the network .",
    "then the model proceeds by picking random pairs of nodes and adding an edge between them if their actual degrees are less than their desired degrees .",
    "when all nodes except possibly one , if the sum of the degree sequence is odd , has their desired degree , the network has been constructed .",
    "the model does not enforce a simple graph ( i.e.  if there are already edges between a selected pair of nodes , one would still add another edge , and links from a vertex to itself are also allowed ) . in other words , the configuration model generates a multigraph . since the empirical graphs in our study are simple graphs by construction , we convert the output of the configuration model to a simple graph by deleting multiple edges and self - loops . in the literature this construction is sometimes called the _ erased configuration model _  @xcite .    like many previous studies , we focus on networks with a power - law degree distribution , so the probability of a vertex having degree @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "a problem with this approach is that the degrees ( and consequently the number of edges ) will fluctuate very much , meaning that we would need a prohibitively large number of averages . to partially mitigate this problem , we truncate the power - law distribution at @xmath59 , which",
    ", asymptotically as @xmath12 , up to a ( random ) factor independent of @xmath6 , is the highest degree in networks with independent power - law degrees .",
    "such truncation preserves the limiting degree distribution and improves the precision of the estimated average values of the infection outbreak .",
    "the parameter values we use are : @xmath60 ( as a typical value of empirical networks ) and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , or @xmath65 .",
    "we generate @xmath66 networks of each combination of parameter values .",

    "( [ eq : chi ] ) as @xmath77c_\\mathrm{info}.\\ ] ] in the sir model , @xmath78 is subadditive , i.e.  @xmath79 , for any @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "such subadditivity plays an important role in algorithmic solutions to the influence maximization problem , which is closely related to the vaccination problem but has a somewhat opposite goal : choose the initial set of individuals who get an infection , or information , so that the information spreading in the network is maximized  @xcite .",
    "remember the notation @xmath11 for the fraction of the population that needs to be vaccinated in order to prevent a global outbreak .",
    "then @xmath78 is increasing to @xmath4 for @xmath82 , and @xmath83 when @xmath84 . combining this with subadditivity",

    "( [ eq : chi1 ] ) is achieved when @xmath86c_\\mathrm{info}.\\ ] ] since @xmath87 is non - decreasing in @xmath7 , it follows that the maximum gain is achieved for some @xmath88 .",
    "let us now look at @xmath69 for different vaccination strategies .",
    "let us first consider the _",
    "random _ ( _ r _ ) vaccination strategy .",
    "assume that the underlying graph is a configuration model .",
    "if the degree distribution has a finite variance , then @xmath89 can be obtained directly from formula ( 3.5 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite by equating the reproduction number to its critical value  1 .",
    "specifically , we have : @xmath90 and the value is positive if the global outbreak occurs when no vaccination takes place . when the variance is infinite , as in our case @xmath91 , then @xmath92 , so the global outbreak can not be prevented by the random vaccination .",
    "we now turn to @xmath93 .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : derivative ] ) we obtain @xmath94 with @xmath92 , we can expect that @xmath93 is quite large for small @xmath1 , and is decreasing when @xmath1 becomes larger .",
    "interestingly , this is what we observe in the case study in fig .",
    "[ fig : params1 ] .",
    "we can also explain the not very large gain in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmpr0 ] by the relatively slow growth of @xmath78 .    by theorem  ( 3.3 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , in configuration model , when the variance of the degrees is finite , for the _ acquaintance _ one can find @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , this can be the case even when the variance of the degrees is infinite , as long as the reproduction number in formula ( 3.13 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , is smaller than one .",
    "this is the effect of vaccinating nodes with size - biased degree distribution .",
    "moreover , for the same epidemic on the same graph , it holds that @xmath96 , where the equality is possible only if both values are equal to one .",
    "the optimal fraction of vaccinated individuals @xmath97 now satisfies the equation @xmath98 note that compared to the random vaccination , the right - hand side has an additional positive term . combining the above considerations and the sharper growth of @xmath78 , we expect that @xmath97 is considerably smaller than @xmath93 .",
    "again , interestingly , this is the case in fig .  [",
    "fig : params1 ] .",
    "the gain is harder to predict because it depends on both vaccination and information costs . in the case study in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmpr0 ] , we see that the gain for the acquaintance vaccination is similar to the one for the random vaccination , while in other data sets the acquaintance vaccination outperforms other protocols especially when information cost is high , seefig .",
    "[ fig : cmpr1 ] .    _ degree _ , _ coreness _ and _ ci _ strategies must be most effective in configuration model because they target the nodes that have the highest potential for spreading the infection . a formula for the average outbreak size in configuration model in case of degree - based vaccination",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite for a general model of infection spreading",
    ". however , these results are applicable when nodes of degree @xmath99 are removed with given probability , and can not be directly used when fraction @xmath7 of highest degree nodes is removed .",
    "the fraction @xmath69 for these strategies satisfies the same equation as @xmath93 : @xmath100 compared the _ acquaintance _ protocol , we can expect a faster decline of @xmath85 but the value @xmath101 is also smaller . in the case study in fig .",
    "[ fig : params1 ] we have @xmath102 . for _ coreness _ and _ ci _ it is the other way around .",
    "very large value of @xmath69 , especially for _ coreness _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : params1 ] signals that these strategies are in fact inefficient for the _ colorado springs _ network ( case study ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmpr0 ] , for the same case study we observe that _ degree _ , _ coreness _ and _ ci _ have a very small gain . the efficiency of _ ci _ on configuration model ( fig .  [ fig : cmpr_arti1 ] ) and on the _ prostitution _ data set in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmpr1 ] , for similar values of the parameters , is an interesting finding that deserves further research .",
    "possible explanation can be in a small number of triangles  the feature that the _ prostitution _ data set and configuration model share .",
    "finally , consider _ random - walk _ and _ tsh _ strategies .",
    "since these strategies target nodes with large degrees , we expect @xmath103 to be slightly larger than for _",
    "degree_. the optimal value @xmath69 satisfies @xmath104 for large enough @xmath6 , we expect the last term above to be small .",
    "hence , we expect similar optimal values of @xmath69 for the _ random - walk _ and _ tsh _ strategies as for _ degree _ , but this optimal values will decrease when @xmath0 increases .",
    "as for the net gain , it should be considerably higher than that of _ degree _ , _ coreness _ and _ ci _ strategies when @xmath0 is large enough . the comparison to the _ acquaintance _ strategy is more tricky since the latter also targets high degree nodes but at lower costs because @xmath105 holds for _ random walk _ and _ tsh_. on the other hand , the accuracy of _ random walk _ and _ tsh _ is higher .",
    "the comparison between the three randomized strategies : _ acquaintance _ , _ random walk _ , and _ tsh _ thus depends on the interplay between accurate targeting and information costs .",
    "our approach is based on the hypothesis that carrying out a network - based method for targeted immunization comes with costs for mapping out the network and the vaccination itself .",
    "these costs need to be put in context of the societal cost of sick individuals . from this starting point",
    ", we have evaluated the cost efficiency of seven network - based vaccination methods .",
    "there is not one universally best method .",
    "rather , depending on the network structure and relative vaccination and information costs , the best method ( at least for the network and parameters we explore ) seem to be one of five_acquaintance _ , _ tsh _ , _ ci _ , _ coreness _ and _ random walk_. we make this point both by analytical calculations and simulations .    _ acquaintance _ vaccination is almost always the most efficient for small @xmath1 and large @xmath0 .",
    "it is the protocol that uses second least network information after _",
    "random_. for very large @xmath0 , _ random _ will trivially be the most efficient ( keep in mind that @xmath0 can , in principle , be larger than one ) , but we never observe this .",
    "_ tsh _ dominates the region of large @xmath1 and small @xmath0 , for denser networks ( for sparser networks _ ci _ could also be most efficient ) . _",
    "_ dominates intermediate values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is hard to speculate why , but it is probably related to the fact that the optimal parameter values of _ tsh _ changes quickly for small @xmath0 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fracvac1 ] ) , meaning that this protocol is more adaptable than _ random walk _ in this region .",
    "_ ci _ performs well for sparse networks with few triangles , especially in the region of large @xmath1 and small @xmath0 .",
    "_ degree _ is never most efficient , meaning that vaccinating exactly in order of degree is not so important that it is worth obtaining all the network information .",
    "_ coreness _ is almost never most efficient , supporting refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( but disagreeing with ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the main message of this work is that one need to evaluate any targeted vaccination protocol with the information and vaccination costs in mind .",
    "if one evaluates only one special case ( like zero vaccination and information costs ) , it is probable that one reaches the wrong conclusion about the practical efficiency of a vaccination algorithm . in real vaccination campaigns ,",
    "there are of course yet other complications : it could be hard ( politically , and maybe morally ) to motivate a targeted vaccination campaign , instead of prioritizing sensitive groups .",
    "there could be substantial errors in reporting the network information , which could affect the protocols efficiency .",
    "the assumption that the disease has not yet spread in the network is probably never true in practical situations ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite on vaccinations using contact tracing of infected individuals during an epidemic ) .",
    "there are thus , several other complicating factors to evaluate theoretical vaccination protocols in more realistic settings .",
    "our work , however , advances towards increased realism , and we expect most conclusions of the efficiency of the protocols to hold qualitatively with the caveats mentioned above .    p.h . was supported by the basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea ( nrf ) funded by the ministry of education ( 2016r1d1a1b01007774 ) .",
