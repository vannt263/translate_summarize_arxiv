    "symbolic dynamics is a versatile tool for describing the complicated time evolution of dynamical systems , the smale horseshoe being a famous prototype @xcite . here , instead of representing a trajectory by a continuum of numbers , one watches the alternation of symbols from a finite alphabet .",
    "in the process some information is  lost \" but certain important invariants and robust properties of the dynamics may be kept @xcite .",
    "most studies of symbolic dynamics are based on the so - called generating partition @xcite of the phase space , for which topological entropy achieves its maximum @xcite .",
    "symbolic dynamics based on generating partitions plays a crucial role in understanding many different properties of dynamical systems .",
    "however , finding generating partitions is generally a difficult problem @xcite .",
    "some consequences of using misplaced partitions have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , certain non - generating partitions have recently been shown to have particular uses .",
    "specifically , appropriately chosen partitions that restrict the appearance of certain symbolic subsequences have been used for distinguishing random from deterministic time series @xcite , and for investigating the collective behavior of coupled systems @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "time delays arise naturally in the modeling of many physical systems . in spatially extended systems , such as networks ,",
    "delays are a consequence of the fact that signals can not be transmitted instantly over distances .",
    "an additional source of delays can be the time it takes for each unit to process the information it receives before it acts on it .",
    "interestingly , networks of dynamical systems can still synchronize their actions under certain conditions despite time delays , although the synchronized solution can be very different from an undelayed network @xcite .",
    "sometimes the value of the delays are unknown or may be changing in time , and the determination of the delay value is a problem in itself @xcite . in studying the collective behavior of networks of dynamical systems ,",
    "it is therefore both realistic and important to take time delays into account in the modeling and to develop techniques to handle the subsequent complications in the analysis .    in the following , we use symbolic dynamics for the study of discrete - time systems with multiple connection delays .",
    "although significant time delays are common in physical and biological systems , the effects of delays on the symbolic dynamics have not received much attention so far .",
    "we extend the notion of  forbidden words \" , that is , symbol sequences whose appearance is restricted by the dynamical constraints , to systems with delays .",
    "the basic idea is to derive forbidden words for the delayed system from the properties of the undelayed map .",
    "we show how forbidden sequences are related to the time delays in the system and how this information provides useful information about the dynamics .",
    "we apply the theoretical findings to two important practical problems : detecting synchrony in a large network with multiple delays using measurements from only a few nodes , and determining unknown values of the delays in the network .",
    "as might be expected from the `` crudeness '' introduced by symbolic dynamics , the method has a certain robustness against noise .",
    "let @xmath0 be a map on a subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 , and consider the dynamical system defined by the iteration rule @xmath3 where the iteration step @xmath4 plays the role of discrete time .",
    "let @xmath5 be a partition of @xmath1 , i.e. , a collection of nonempty and mutually disjoint subsets satisfying @xmath6 .",
    "( we assume @xmath7 to prevent trivial cases . )",
    "the symbolic dynamics corresponding to ( [ system ] ) is the sequence of symbols @xmath8 , where @xmath9 if @xmath10 . in the usual grammatical analogy , the symbols @xmath11 form the _ alphabet _ , and finite symbol sequences are called _ words_. we say the set @xmath12 _ avoids _",

    "the significance of avoiding sets is that they yield forbidden words : if @xmath12 avoids @xmath13 , then the symbolic dynamics for ( [ system ] ) can not contain the symbol sequence @xmath17 .",
    "the notion is extended in a straightforward way to the @xmath18th iterate of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , if @xmath19 , then the symbol sequence for the dynamics can not contain any subsequence of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes @xmath22 arbitrary symbols . ) . in other words ,",
    "a symbol block of length @xmath23 that starts with @xmath24 can not end with @xmath25 .",
    "this constrains the symbol sequences that can be generated by a given map , and provides a robust method to distinguish between different systems by inspecting their symbolic dynamics . as examples of avoiding sets , we mention that , for the familiar unimodal maps of the interval @xmath26 $ ] , such as the tent or logistic maps , the set @xmath27 $ ] and its subsets are self - avoiding , where @xmath28 denotes the positive fixed point of @xmath14 .",
    "more generally , partitions that contain avoiding sets can always be found . we give a constructive proof .",
    "suppose one starts with some partition @xmath29 of @xmath30 sets for which ( [ av ] ) does not hold for any @xmath31 ; that is , @xmath32 now fix some pair @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "partition the set @xmath12 further into two disjoint sets as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 thus , @xmath37 and @xmath38 contain those points of @xmath12 that are mapped to @xmath13 and those that are not mapped to @xmath13 , respectively , by the function @xmath14 .",
    "note that by definition @xmath39 , that is , @xmath38 avoids @xmath13 under @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 by ( [ qq31 ] ) , and @xmath41 because otherwise we would have @xmath42 , which would imply @xmath43 ( since @xmath12 and @xmath13 are disjoint sets by assumption ) , which would contradict ( [ qq31 ] ) .",
    "hence , we can define a new partition of @xmath44 nonempty and mutually disjoint sets@xmath45 which is obtained from the original one by replacing @xmath12 by @xmath37 and adding @xmath38 , in which the set @xmath38 avoids @xmath13 .",
    "the same argument can be used to construct self - avoiding sets : assume @xmath46 ( otherwise further partition @xmath12 to obtain a set which is not invariant under @xmath14 , which is possible except for the trivial case when @xmath14 is the identity map . )",
    "define @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath38 is a self - avoiding set in the new partition ( [ qq32 ] ) .",
    "hence , it is possible to modify a given partition so that the sequence @xmath17 ( or @xmath49 ) never occurs in the symbolic dynamics .",
    "the above arguments apply equally well to discrete - time inclusions @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a set - valued function in @xmath2 .",
    "this case arises , e.g. , when the actual function @xmath14 is not precisely known or is constructed from data , or when measurements are contaminated with noise , so the value @xmath52 can only be determined up to some error bound .",
    "for instance , the point - value @xmath52 plus the `` error disc '' could be used to define the set - value @xmath53 .",
    "we define avoiding sets for set - valued functions @xmath51 in the same way through ( [ av ] ) , which similarly yield forbidden sequences for ( [ eq : inclusion ] ) .",
    "hence , all results we present here remain valid when equalities are replaced by set inclusions .    to apply the above ideas to delayed dynamics , we first consider the following extension of ( [ system ] ) , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the time delay and @xmath56 $ ] is a parameter measuring the relative weight of the past in determining the next state .",
    "the significance of eq .",
    "( [ delayed ] ) is that it governs the behavior of the synchronous solutions of coupled map networks with transmission delays @xcite , which are studied in section [ sec : network ] .",
    "the domain @xmath1 of the map @xmath14 is required to be a convex set in order for the iterations ( [ delayed ] ) to be meaningful",
    ". clearly , for @xmath57 ( [ delayed ] ) reduces to ( [ system ] ) .",
    "the symbolic dynamics is defined as before , but we define avoiding sets slightly differently .",
    "we say the set @xmath12 _ convexly avoids _",
    "@xmath13 under @xmath14 if @xmath58 , where `` conv '' denotes the convex hull of a set .",
    "such sets give rise to forbidden sequences as follows : if @xmath12 convexly avoids @xmath13 under @xmath14 , then the symbolic sequence @xmath59 is not possible for the delayed system ( [ delayed ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of ( [ delayed ] ) and the observation that if @xmath60 and @xmath61 are both in @xmath12 , then any convex combination of @xmath62 and @xmath63 belongs to the convex hull of @xmath64 and so lies outside of @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath12 is convexly self - avoiding , then any sequence of @xmath65 symbols that begin and end with @xmath24 can not be followed by another @xmath24 .",
    "an important observation is that , although the dynamics of ( [ delayed ] ) can vary greatly with @xmath66 @xcite , the forbidden sequences ( [ forbidden ] ) are independent of the value of @xmath66 .",
    "thus , ( [ forbidden ] ) remains a forbidden sequence for the symbolic dynamics of the time - dependent equation @xmath67 where @xmath68 $ ] is allowed to be a function of time .",
    "finally , we generalize to equations with multiple delays of the form @xmath69 where the coefficients @xmath70 are nonnegative and satisfy @xmath71 .",
    "such equations govern the synchronous solutions of coupled maps with multiple delays , as will be shown in section [ sec : multiple ] .",
    "note that the right hand side of ( [ delayed2 ] ) lies in the convex hull of the set @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath12 convexly avoids @xmath13 under @xmath14 , then the sequence @xmath73 is forbidden for ( [ delayed2 ] ) ; that is , a sequence of consecutive @xmath24 s of length @xmath74 can not be followed by a @xmath25 .",
    "again , this result is independent of the values of the coefficients @xmath70 , so the latter can be allowed to vary with time , subject to the constraint that they remain nonnegative and sum up to 1 .",
    "further restrictions are obtained if some @xmath75 is identically zero , in which case ( [ forbidden2 ] ) will be forbidden even when the symbol at position @xmath76 is replaced by an arbitrary symbol in the alphabet .",
    "the additional condition of convexity of the sets in case of the delayed dynamics does not present an extra restriction in many practical situations .",
    "in fact , one often measures a single component , say the first one , of the @xmath77-dimensional vector @xmath78 . in this case , a simple partition of @xmath1 given by the disjoint union @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath28 is a scalar threshold value , which can be chosen to make both @xmath81 and @xmath82 nonempty .",
    "it is easy to see that both @xmath81 and @xmath82 defined in this way are convex whenever @xmath1 is convex .",
    "such partitions are almost surely non - generating , so the corresponding symbol sequences do not capture all features of the dynamics .",
    "( for a discussion of obtaining partitions in a simple setting , see ( * ? ? ? * section vii ) . ) nevertheless , it will be seen that they still contain important information that can be utilized to study some important aspects about the delayed dynamics .",
    "we now move from single maps to networks of coupled maps , in the context of a model which is sometimes referred to as the coupled map lattice @xcite .",
    "we consider a general form allowing arbitrary coupling topology , directed and weighted connections , as well as time delay along the connections : @xmath83 .",

    "( it is understood that the summation term is set to zero in ( [ cml ] ) for any unit for which @xmath89 is zero . )",
    "the delay @xmath90 is the time it takes for the information from a unit to reach its neighbors and be processed .",
    "the system is said to synchronize if @xmath91 as @xmath92 for all @xmath31 and all initial conditions from some open set . in this case",
    ", the state of every node asymptotically approaches the same _ synchronous solution _",
    "@xmath60 , whose dynamics is governed by ( [ system ] ) and ( [ delayed ] ) , respectively , depending on whether the delay @xmath90 is zero or nonzero . in the absence of delays , various aspects of the network",
    "have been studied using symbolic dynamics @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on the delayed case .",
    "it is known that the network ( [ cml ] ) can synchronize even under delays , where the units are unaware of the present states of their neighbors but still can act in unison @xcite .",
    "the important distinction from the undelayed case , however , is that the synchronous dynamics @xmath60 is no longer identical to the isolated dynamics ( [ system ] ) of the units , but is governed by the delayed equation ( [ delayed ] ) .",
    "a consequence is that the overall system ( [ cml ] ) can exhibit a much wider range of behavior than its constituent units through the coordination of their actions @xcite .",
    "an important problem is to determine whether a large network is synchronized using information from just a few nodes . as a first application",
    ", we study this problem in delayed networks .        normally the symbol sequences observed from a node of a network can vary widely between the nodes .",
    "however , in the synchronized state @xmath93 for all @xmath24 , so that the symbolic sequences observed from a node will be subject to the same constraints as that generated by ( [ delayed ] ) .",
    "the choice of the node is arbitrary so long as the network is capable of chaotic synchronization ( which is the case for the choice of parameters in our example systems ) .",
    "this gives a method of detecting synchronization of the network by choosing an arbitrary node and calculating the transition probabilities of symbol subsequences : from the relative frequencies of occurrence of subsequences of the form ( [ forbidden ] ) in the measured time series , one estimates the transition probabilities @xmath94 , that is , the conditional probability that a sequence of length @xmath65 starting and ending with @xmath24 is followed by @xmath25 . letting @xmath95 denote the average squared difference between the observed transition probabilities of the network and those of ( [ delayed ] ) , synchronization is signaled when @xmath96 .",
    "[ fig1n ] illustrates the relation between synchronization and forbidden sequences , for the chaotic tent map @xmath97 and the partition @xmath98,\\quad s_{2}=(x^{\\ast},1],\\label{partition}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the fixed point of @xmath14 .",
    "note that @xmath82 is a ( convexly ) self - avoiding set under @xmath14 .",
    "we evolve ( [ cml ] ) starting from random initial conditions and estimate the transition probabilities using time series of length 1000 from a randomly selected node .",
    "( we note that the length of the time series used is independent of the network size . )",
    "synchronization occurs when the variance @xmath100^{2}\\right\\rangle _ { t}$ ] drops to zero , where @xmath101 denotes the average over the nodes of the network and @xmath102 denotes an average over time . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1n ] , the region for synchronization exactly coincides with the region where the transition probabilities for the network are identical to those of eq .",
    "( [ delayed ] ) .",
    "hence , regardless of network topology and size , both synchronized and unsynchronized behavior can be detected over the whole range of coupling strengths using only measurements from an arbitrarily selected node .",
    "moreover , figure [ fig1n](g - h ) show that the `` crudeness '' introduced by using symbolic sequences also provides some robustness against noise .    as a second application",
    ", we consider the reverse problem of determining the value of the delay @xmath90 in ( [ delayed ] ) from observed symbolic dynamics .",
    "for this purpose , we check the presence of subsequences of the form ( [ forbidden ] ) of various lengths , knowing that such a sequence of length @xmath103 would be forbidden . plotting the occurrence frequencies of ( [ forbidden ] ) against @xmath90 ,",
    "the actual value of the delay is found at the point where the frequency drops to zero ( or attains its minimum , in the presence of small noise ) .",
    "similarly , the value of the delay in the network ( [ cml ] ) can be found from a knowledge of its synchrony .",
    "a practical situation is when the value of @xmath90 is unknown but the network is known to be synchronized or can be made to synchronize by the adjustment of control parameters .",

    "the true value of @xmath90 corresponds to the point where the probability drops to zero .",

    "this is a consequence of the observation that the synchronized solution does not depend on the network topology and its forbidden sequences ( [ forbidden ] ) are independent of @xmath66 .",
    "the conditions for synchronization , of course , depend on the connection structure . in the undelayed case ,",
    "synchronization conditions involve the existence of spanning trees of the union graphs and can be quantified in terms of the hajnal diameter of infinite sequences of connection matrices @xcite . on the other hand , the precise conditions for synchronization of delayed time - varying networks is a more involved problem .",
    "a further generalization is to allow delays that change with time ; @xmath111 . in this case",
    ", sequences such as ( [ forbidden ] ) will be forbidden at some time point @xmath85 for the corresponding value of @xmath112 .",

    "even the precise time dependence @xmath112 is not known , one can still obtain useful information by studying such subsequences .",
    "thus , if @xmath112 often assumes some value @xmath18 , then the @xmath117-symbol block @xmath118 will correspondingly appear more seldom ; hence , rather than being forbidden within the whole symbolic history , it will have reduced frequency of occurrence .",
    "this observation helps determine the unknown values of the time - varying delay . to illustrate , we return to our example of coupled tent maps used for figs .  [ fig1n ] and [ fig2n ] , this time considering a time - varying connection delay @xmath90 whose value at each time step is chosen randomly from the set @xmath119 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : time - var - delay ] we plot the occurrence frequencies of the sequences ( [ forbidden ] ) for various values of @xmath90 .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "[ fig2n ] , the frequency does not drop to zero but displays two marked dips at the values @xmath120 and @xmath121 , agreeing with the fact that the delay was randomly switching between 5 and 7 .     with equal probability at each time step .",
    "the observed probability @xmath104 is plotted against @xmath90 , displaying marked dips at the true values of the delay .",

    "the foregoing ideas can be extended to systems with multiple delays , e.g. , to the coupled map network @xmath125,\\label{cml2}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 denotes the transmission delay from @xmath25 to @xmath24 . whereas the network ( [ cml ] ) with a constant delay always admits a synchronous solution",
    ", one needs additional conditions in the case ( [ cml2 ] ) of multiple delays .",
    "namely , eq .  ( [ cml2 ] ) has non - constant synchronized solutions provided that the fraction of weighted incoming connections having a given value of delay is the same for every vertex . to see this ,",
    "suppose @xmath93 for all @xmath24 . substituting into ( [ cml2 ] ) and rearranging , we have @xmath127 where we have used the fact that @xmath88",
    ". one can decompose the summation further over the delay values since the delays @xmath126 are integers , thus obtaining @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the maximum delay in the network and @xmath130 is the index set of the connections to @xmath24 that are subject to a delay of precisely @xmath90 .",
    "now if @xmath14 is constant over the synchronous trajectory @xmath131 , then the term @xmath132 ) ) can be taken outside the summation and the double summation adds up to 1 , reducing the equation to ( [ delayed ] ) .",
    "this case happens , in particular , when the synchronous solution is constant . in general , however , for non - constant synchronous solutions , @xmath14 will not be constant over @xmath133 . in this case , since the left hand side of ( [ qq21 ] ) is independent of @xmath24 , we require that the quantity @xmath134 be also independent of @xmath24 . in other words , for any given value of delay , the weighted fraction of incoming links having that delay value should be the same for each node .",
    "we let @xmath135 denote this common fraction , and define@xmath136 note that @xmath137 ; therefore , @xmath138.thus ( [ qq21 ] ) becomes @xmath139 which is the same as eq .",
    "( [ delayed2 ] ) considered in section [ sec : map ] . thus the synchronous solution @xmath60 of the system ( [ cml - multi ] ) with multiple delays obeys ( [ delayed2 ] ) , and by the results of section [ sec : map ] , symbolic sequences of the form ( [ forbidden2 ] ) are forbidden for the synchronous dynamics .",
    "such symbol sequences can thus be used to determine whether a delay value of @xmath30 is present in the network ( [ cml2 ] ) , yielding a systematic way of finding the values of all delays from a knowledge of synchrony .",
    "conversely , synchronization can be detected by comparing the transition probabilities of symbolic sequences from an arbitrary node to those of ( [ delayed2 ] ) if the delays are known .",
    "as an example of networks with multiple delays , we consider a network of four nodes arranged on a circle , where each node is coupled to its nearest neighbors on its left and right with delay equal to 1 and to its far neighbor on the opposite side with delay equal to 2 .",

    "hence , from ( [ forbidden2 ] ) , symbol sequences containing @xmath146 consecutive 2 s are forbidden .",
    "one can then check the lengths of uninterrupted subsequences of 2 s ( or 3 s ) from a node of the synchronized network and determine the largest value of the delay .",
    "[ fig : multiple - delay ] shows that subsequences of four consecutive 2 s are not observed , implying that @xmath147 is indeed equal to 2 .",

    "in this paper we have used symbolic dynamics to study discrete - time systems and networks with time delays .",
    "we have derived forbidden symbol sequences for the delayed system from the properties of the undelayed map .",
    "although the partitions used are usually non - generating , the forbidden sequences are related to certain characteristics of the dynamics , and in particular to delays .",
    "consequently , the value of the delay in the system can be determined by the presence and absence of such sequences .",
    "conversely , a knowledge of the delays enables one to detect synchronization ( or phase locking ) in the network using measurements from a single node .",
    "the method has the advantage of being based on a phase - space partition that is much easier to obtain than a generating partition .",
    "furthermore , it can utilize rather short measurements from a single node of the network .",
    "the computations are therefore fast and independent of the network size , and do not require knowledge of the connection structure . as such , they can complement or be an alternative to existing techniques for detecting synchronization based on phase - space reconstruction @xcite and methods for estimating delay times @xcite .",
    "although we have restricted our discussion to complete synchronization , the ideas apply also to some other types of collective behavior , for instance to _ phase - locked solutions _ and _ traveling waves_. in such collective states , the symbol sequences of all nodes in the network are identical except for a time shift ( that depends on the particular node ) , which does not change symbol statistics .",
    "hence , the forbidden sequences can be derived as before from the properties of the local map , with the same implications as in the applications presented here .    beyond the coupled map lattice model ( [ cml ] ) ,",
    "there is also a growing interest in more general coupling schemes such as @xmath148 synchronized solutions @xmath149 of ( [ general ] ) satisfy @xmath150 where the function @xmath151 is defined by @xmath152 thus , for instance ( [ delayed ] ) becomes a special case with @xmath153 .",
    "the notion of avoiding sets can be extended to the more general case : we say that the set @xmath12 avoids @xmath13 under @xmath151 if @xmath154 if ( [ av - general ] ) holds , then the symbol sequence ( [ forbidden ] ) is a forbidden sequence for the dynamics ( [ sync - general ] ) . more generally , if @xmath155 for some sets in the partition , then the symbol sequence@xmath156 will be forbidden . with a knowledge of forbidden sequences",

    "the difficulty is of course not unique to the symbolic - dynamics approach , since the dynamics of the system ( [ general ] ) , with more parameters in its structure , is not easy to characterize in its full generality , although there has been some recent progress in this direction .",

    "@xcite has shown the range of rich dynamics such systems can exhibit at synchrony .",

    "only a time series of measurements is available without any detailed knowledge of the dynamical process generating it . in the absence of",

    "<S> we use symbolic dynamics to study discrete - time dynamical systems with multiple time delays . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the concept of avoiding sets , which arise from specific non - generating partitions of the phase space and restrict the occurrence of certain symbol sequences related to the characteristics of the dynamics . in particular , we show that the resulting forbidden sequences are closely related to the time delays in the system . </S>",
    "<S> we present two applications to coupled map lattices , namely ( 1 ) detecting synchronization and ( 2 ) determining unknown values of the transmission delays in networks with possibly directed and weighted connections and measurement noise . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applicable to multi - dimensional as well as set - valued maps , and to networks with time - varying delays and connection structure .    _ </S>",
