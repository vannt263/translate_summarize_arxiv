    "there has been much recent interest in calculating the motion of astrophysical systems which emit gravitational waves in anticipation of data from a new generation of detectors .",
    "full three - dimensional numerical simulations are required in order to produce useful results for many of the most promising observational candidates , such as colliding black holes .",
    "however , there also exists a large class of systems which can be accurately modelled by a small isolated body moving in the fixed background created by a much larger body ( e.g. ,  a solar mass star falling into a supermassive black hole ) .",
    "for such a system , we might hope to produce useful results by treating the smaller object as a point particle and introducing the effects of its fields and internal structure as perturbations to the background geodesic orbit .",
    "the perturbations due to the particle s own fields , commonly called `` radiation reaction '' or `` self force '' effects , are particularly important because they include the forces responsible for the decay of the body s orbit . if both the background spacetime and the unperturbed orbit of the body possess enough symmetry , it is possible to infer the effects of these forces on the orbit from global conservation principles : one calculates the energy and/or angular momentum radiated to infinity by a particle in geodesic motion , and then modifies the orbit to reflect this energy and angular momentum loss in a time - averaged fashion .",
    "( obviously , this procedure can be iterated if greater accuracy is required . ) some justification for this method is provided by quinn and wald  @xcite . however , in the absence of such symmetries , it is necessary to directly calculate the effects of the local fields in the neighborhood of the particle .",
    "unfortunately , this problem is ill - posed , since the fields diverge in the neighborhood of the particle s world line , so that any such local calculation must include a rule for extracting the appropriate finite part of these divergent fields .",
    "there is an extensive literature devoted to this regularization problem . in 1938",
    ", dirac  @xcite reproduced the force expression ( originally given by abraham  @xcite ) for a point particle coupled to an electromagnetic field in minkowski spacetime by imposing local energy conservation on a tube surrounding the particle s world line and subtracting the infinite contributions to the force through a `` mass renormalization '' scheme . in 1960 , dewitt and brehme  @xcite generalized this approach to an arbitrary curved background spacetime .",
    "( a trivial calculational error in their paper was later corrected by hobbs  @xcite . ) more recently , mino et al .",
    "@xcite further adapted this approach to produce a force expression for a point particle coupled to a linearized gravitational field on a vacuum background spacetime , and quinn and wald  @xcite rederived both the electromagnetic and gravitational forces using an axiomatic approach which , in effect , regularizes the forces by comparing forces in different spacetimes .",
    "there has emerged from this work a consensus regarding the correct equation of motion for a particle coupled to electromagnetic fields on an arbitrary curved background and for a particle coupled to linearized gravitational fields on a vacuum background . in principle",
    ", the latter equation allows one to calculate the dynamics of the astrophysical systems of interest described above . in practice , however , very little progress has been made in applying either equation of motion to concrete physical examples for two reasons .",
    "first , given a world line in an arbitrary spacetime , the calculation of the associated retarded fields is a complex and difficult problem .",
    "second , once these fields are calculated , the equations of motion require one to identify that portion of the retarded field at each point of the world line which arises from source contributions interior to the light cone .",
    "this part of the field is often called the `` tail term , '' and most approximation schemes for calculating the retarded field entangle the tail and non - tail contributions to the field .",
    "nevertheless , some progress has been made , notably in the electromagnetic case . in 1964 ,",
    "dewitt and dewitt  @xcite calculated the tail term for an electromagnetic particle in a circular orbit on a schwarzschild background to leading order in the background curvature and the velocity of the particle . in 1980 ,",
    "smith and will  @xcite calculated the force on an electromagnetic particle held static on a schwarzschild background , essentially by repeating dewitt and brehme s local stress - energy conservation argument .",
    "neither result has been generalized to the case of a massive particle coupled to gravitational fields , nor has there been any direct progress on the more complex systems which are of interest to the gravitational wave astronomy community .",
    "however , several new ideas have emerged in recent years which may lead to further progress .",
    "ori  @xcite has suggested an alternative regularization scheme involving averaging of multipole moments which is better adapted to concrete calculations , while others have suggested a hybrid scheme in which the tail term is calculated through a combination of hadamard expansion techniques for small distances and multipole techniques for larger distances  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to test these ideas . in particular",
    ", we must know whether these schemes are equivalent to the equations of motion discussed above .",
    "because of its mathematical simplicity , one natural system in which to explore all of these questions is that of a point particle coupled to a scalar field",
    ". motivated by this , several researchers have begun to apply the ideas discussed above to the scalar system . in particular , ori s method has been applied to the motion of scalar particles in the kerr spacetime  @xcite and in the schwarzschild spacetime  @xcite , and wiseman  @xcite has adapted the calculation of smith and will in order to calculate the force on a scalar particle held static in the schwarzschild spacetime . in the present paper , we generalize the axiomatic approach of quinn and wald  @xcite in order to produce the general equation of motion for a point particle coupled to a scalar field on an arbitrary background spacetime .",
    "it is hoped that this general expression will be useful in evaluating the validity of the calculational schemes described above for the scalar case , and that this comparison will ultimately help to clarify the relationship between the various methods which have been proposed for the electromagnetic and gravitational cases .    in sec .",
    "[ force ] , we derive an expression for the force on a particle following an arbitrary trajectory in curved spacetime . then , in sec .",
    "[ eom ] , we explore the equations of motion which follow from this expression in the absence of non - scalar forces .",
    "given a spacetime containing a particle world line and a klein - gordon field sourced by the particle , we wish to define the total scalar force @xmath0 on the particle at each point of the world line , including so - called self - force or radiation reaction effects .",
    "for an electromagnetic point particle in flat spacetime , an expression of this sort was first given by abraham  @xcite in 1905 , was later rederived in a relativistic context by dirac  @xcite , and is often found in textbooks ( e.g. ,  jackson  @xcite ) . however , since there are no classical point particles in nature , and the theoretical status of such objects is problematic at best , it is important to ask how any such prescription is constrained by physics .",
    "our view is that the force law should reflect the force on an extended body coupled to a scalar field in the limit of small spatial extent . in particular , fix the background spacetime and consider a family of extended bodies and corresponding scalar fields parameterized by @xmath1 , the spatial size of the bodies . for each body in the family , we define a center of mass world line @xmath2 ( e.g. , by the methods of beiglbck  @xcite ) and calculate the charge , @xmath3 , and mass , @xmath4 , of the body with respect to this world line , as well as the force @xmath5 $ ] exerted by the scalar field on the body .",
    "( for the definition of the force exerted on a small body by a field to which it is coupled , see quinn and wald  @xcite . )",
    "we further require that @xmath4 and @xmath3 vanish as @xmath1 goes to zero .",
    "for such a one - parameter family , quinn and wald  @xcite argue that it is possible to specify some set of conditions on the internal structure and composition of the extended bodies such that the limit of @xmath5 $ ] for small @xmath1 is independent of their internal details .",
    "we would like our expression for @xmath0 to correctly the describe the order @xmath3 and @xmath6 contributions to @xmath5 $ ] which are independent of the internal structure of the body under these conditions .",
    "( other corrections which arise from the internal structure , such as multipole effects and spin effects , have been derived elsewhere and should simply contribute additively at this order . )",
    "unfortunately , the limit described above is quite delicate , and the task of specifying conditions to ensure its convergence appears to be formidable .",
    "( the analysis of dixon  @xcite demonstrates the degree of complexity which arises even without considering self - field effects . ) nevertheless , certain properties of this limit are strongly suggested by the nature of the divergences in the scalar field . following quinn and wald  @xcite",
    ", we will introduce these properties as axioms , and then give the unique prescription for @xmath0 which satisfies these axioms .",
    "in the next subsection , we will motivate our crucial comparison axiom by considering the point particle limit described above and develop the expansions required to state the axiom .",
    "then , in the following subsection , we state both axioms and give the unique prescription for @xmath0 that satisfies them , which is the main result of this paper .",

    "the klein - gordon field @xmath10 satisfies the equation @xmath12 with stress - energy @xmath13 assuming that the total stress - energy is conserved , so that @xmath14 then the force density exerted on the body by the scalar field is given by @xmath15    therefore , naively taking the point particle limit , we would expect the force on a scalar particle of charge @xmath3 to be given by @xmath16 unfortunately , this expression is meaningless as it stands , since @xmath17 diverges on the world line of the particle .",

    "that is , @xmath22 ( here , the average over a sphere of radius @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath24 , is introduced to allow for the possibility that the @xmath25 limit of the difference is finite , but direction - dependent . )",
    "quinn and wald  @xcite give plausibility arguments which suggest that the counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ subtract ] ) is indeed a property of the point particle limit in the electromagnetic and gravitational cases .",

    "( [ subtract ] ) as an axiom and investigate the consequences for @xmath0 .",

    "we wish to expand @xmath10 in @xmath23 , the spatial distance from the world line @xmath2 .",

    "consider a small body in minkowski spacetime with a center of mass world line @xmath2 .",
    "the rest mass of such a body is given by @xmath122 where @xmath44 is the four - velocity of @xmath2 ( defined away from the world line by global parallelism ) , @xmath43 is the surface perpendicular to @xmath44 , and @xmath123 is the volume element compatible with the ( flat ) metric .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath124 \\nonumber\\\\    & = & - \\int_\\sigma u_a \\nabla_b { t_{\\rm body}}^{ab } w^c \\epsilon_{cdef},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath125 is the vector field which connects successive time slices @xmath126 . for a body coupled to a scalar field",
    ", we have @xmath127 , so that @xmath128 which is clearly , in general , nonvanishing . by contrast , in the electromagnetic case , we have @xmath129 , so that @xmath130 for typical models of charged matter , @xmath131 and @xmath44 will become collinear as we take the point particle limit , and @xmath132 will vanish .",
    "perhaps because it is tempting to generalize from the more familiar electromagnetic case , this time variation of the mass in the scalar case has largely been ignored in the literature .",
    "some authors use the equation of motion @xmath133 ( e.g. ,  shapiro and teukolsky  @xcite ) .",
    "this equation is clearly inconsistent , and therefore in general has no solutions , since @xmath82 is perpendicular to the four - velocity while @xmath134 , in general , is not .",

    "( [ accel ] ) above in order to obtain the acceleration of the particle , but then simply ignore the component of @xmath134 which points along @xmath44 and assume that the mass is constant ( e.g. , ori  @xcite ) .",
    "while such an equation of motion is mathematically consistent , it violates global conservation of stress - energy .",
    "( see quinn and wald  @xcite . )    in the discussion above , we have motivated our point particle equations of motion by imposing local stress - energy conservation on continuum matter and taking the point particle limit , using our axioms to extract the appropriate finite part of the divergent fields .",
    "the time variation of the mass arises as a direct consequence of this local stress - energy conservation . in the literature on point particles",
    ", one sometimes sees an alternative derivation which makes no reference to the continuum theory .",
    "instead , the author defines an action for the point particle system and then formally minimizes this action with respect to variations of the fields and the world line in order to produce equations of motion . for completeness",

    "therefore , no solutions of these equations exist .",
    "however , we may view this as a formal derivation of our equations from an action principle .",
    "note that , if we had assumed from the outset that @xmath4 was constant , the only change to the equations would have been to set @xmath141 in eq .",
    "( [ eompoint ] ) . clearly , the resulting equation is inconsistent , since @xmath134 does not , in general , point along the four - velocity .",
    "still , one might wonder , despite the stress - energy conservation arguments given above , whether the above action can be modified to produce the equation of motion @xmath142 since this equation would have the immediate consequence that @xmath143 , as in the electromagnetic case .",
    "wiseman  @xcite has considered a large class of possible coupling terms and has found that , within this class , one can not produce eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) without introducing a nonlinear coupling on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ kgpoint ] ) .",
    "based on this work and the stress - energy considerations discussed above , we conjecture that there exists no action which produces eq .",
