    "observations of shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) provide us evidence for electron acceleration at snr shocks , and in some cases the maximum energy of the electrons exceeds @xmath010  tev @xcite .",

    "however , these previous works are based on 1d simulations , in which configuration of shock magnetic fields can not be modified . since charged particles can easily drift along magnetic fields ,",
    "it is important to take into account the modification of shock magnetic fields and the free motion of particles along shock magnetic fields .",
    "hence , multi - dimensional simulations are necessary .    in the present study",
    "we perform a 2d full particle simulation of a high mach number and low - beta perpendicular collisionless shock .",
    "the preliminary result shows that the electron surfing acceleration is suppressed in a 2d system .",
    "generally speaking , it is difficult to perform multi - dimensional simulations of collisionless shocks even with present - day supercomputers . in the previous simulations of high mach number shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a collisionless shock is excited by interaction between injected and reflected plasmas .",
    "thus , the simulation domain is taken in the downstream rest frame , and the excited shock wave propagates upstream .",
    "it is necessary to take a very long simulation domain in the propagation direction of the shock wave in order to study long - time evolution of moving shock waves .",

    "the heating of electrons along the ambient magnetic field is due to electromagnetic whistler mode waves excited by temperature anisotropy .",
    "in addition , the current - driven instability due to reflected ions does not lead to formation of coherent electrostatic solitary structures because of the free motion of electrons along the ambient magnetic field . as a result of these consequences",

    "this process is independent of shock parameters such as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "even with the realistic parameters , there would be less surfing acceleration in purely perpendicular shocks , because there is no guiding magnetic field to stabilize coherent electrostatic structures .",
    "however , the surfing acceleration might be effective in an oblique shock in which a guiding magnetic field could allow the formation of large - amplitude electrostatic structures .",
    "it is noted that @xcite have also shown that electron surfing acceleration becomes absent by a simplified 2d simulation with different shock geometry .",
    "that is , their simulation domain has been taken in a plane perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field ( which corresponds to the @xmath17-@xmath71 plane in the present model ) .",
    "thus , electrostatic solitary structures generated by the current - driven instability lose coherency by a quite different mechanism .",
