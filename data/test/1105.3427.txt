    "this paper deals with the efficient calculation of approximate solutions to a sequence of problems of the form [ eq : param_prob ] where the parameter @xmath4 is varying slowly . in other words , for a sequence @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is small , we want to solve problem @xmath9 in an efficient way without requiring too much accuracy in the result .    in practice",
    ", sequences of problems of the form [ eq : param_prob ] can be solved in the framework of nonlinear model predictive control ( mpc ) .",
    "mpc is an optimal control technique which avoids computing an optimal control law in a feedback form , which is often a numerically intractable problem . a popular way of solving the optimization problem to calculate the control sequence is using either interior point methods @xcite or sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) @xcite .",
    "a drawback of using sqp is that this method may require several iterations before convergence and therefore the computation time may be too large for a real - time implementation . a solution to this problem",
    "was proposed in @xcite , where the real - time iteration ( rti ) technique was introduced .",
    "extensions to the original idea and some theoretical results are reported in @xcite .",
    "similar nonlinear mpc algorithms are proposed in  @xcite .",
    "rti is based on the observation that for several practical applications of nonlinear mpc , the data of two successive optimization problems to be solved in the mpc loop is numerically close .",
    "in particular , if we express these optimization problems in the form [ eq : param_prob ] , the parameter @xmath4 usually represents the current state of the system , which , for most applications , does nt change significantly in two successive measurements .",
    "the rti technique consists of performing only the first step of the usual sqp algorithm which is initialized using the solution calculated in the previous mpc iteration .    0.1 cm * contribution . * before stating the main contributions of the paper we need to outline the ( full - step ) sequential convex programming ( scp ) algorithm framework applied to problem @xmath10 for a given value @xmath11 of the parameter @xmath4 :    1 .   choose a starting point @xmath12 and set @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   solve the convex approximation of @xmath9 : @xmath14 to obtain a solution @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the jacobian matrix of @xmath17 .",
    "if the stopping criterion is satisfied then : stop . otherwise , set @xmath18 and go back to step 2 .",
    "the real - time sequential convex programming ( rtscp ) method proposed in this paper combines the rti technique and the scp algorithm : instead of solving with scp every @xmath9 to full accuracy , rtscp solves only one convex approximation @xmath19 using as a linearization point @xmath20 , which is the approximate solution of @xmath21 calculated at the previous iteration . therefore , rtscp solves a sequence of convex problems corresponding to the different problems @xmath9 .",
    "this method is suitable for the problems that contain a general convex substructure such as nonsmooth convex cost , second order or semidefinte cone constraints which may not be convenient for sqp methods .    in this paper",
    "we provide a contraction estimate for rtscp which can be interpreted in the following way : if the linearization of the first problem @xmath22 is close enough to the solution of the problem and the quantity @xmath8 is not too big ( which is the case for many problems arising from nonlinear mpc ) , rtscp provides a sequence of good approximations of the sequence of optimal solutions of the problems @xmath9 . as a byproduct of this result",
    ", we obtain a new proof of local convergence for the scp algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ se : rtscp ] proposes a description of the rtscp algorithm .",
    "section [ se : estimates ] proves the contraction estimate for the rtscp method .",
    "the last section shows an application of the rtscp method to nonlinear mpc .",
    "-0.3 cm as mentioned in the previous section , scp solves a possibly nonconvex optimization problem by solving a sequence of convex subproblems which approximate the original problem locally . in this section ,",
    "we combine rti and scp to obtain the rtscp method .",
    "the method consists of the following steps :    * * initialization . *",
    "find an initial value @xmath23 , choose a starting point @xmath12 and compute the information needed at the first iteration such as derivatives , dependent variables ,  .",
    "set @xmath24 . *",
    "* iteration . * 1 .",
    "solve @xmath25 ( see section [ se : estimates ] ) to obtain a solution @xmath26 .",
    "2 .   determine a new parameter @xmath27 , update ( or recompute ) the information needed for the next step .",
    "set @xmath28 and go back to step 1 .",
    "one of the main tasks of the rtscp method is to solve the convex subproblem @xmath25 at each iteration .",
    "this work can be done by either implementing an optimization method which exploits the problem structure or relying on one of the many efficient software tools available nowadays .",
    "[ re : init_point ] in the rtscp method , a starting point @xmath29 in @xmath30 is required .",
    "it can be any point in @xmath30 .",
    "but as we will show later [ theorem 1 ] , if we choose @xmath29 close to the true solution of @xmath22 and @xmath31 is sufficiently small , then the solution @xmath32 of @xmath33 is still close to the true solution of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , in practice , problem @xmath22 can be solved approximately to get a starting point @xmath29 .",
    "[ re : sqp ] problem @xmath10 has a linear cost function .",
    "however , rtscp can deal directly with the problems where the cost function @xmath35 is convex .",
    "if the cost function is quadratic and @xmath30 is a polyhedral set then the rtscp method collapses to the real - time iteration of a gauss - newton method ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    [",
    "re : measure ] in mpc , the parameter @xmath4 is usually the value of the state variables of a dynamic system at the current time @xmath36 . in this case , @xmath4 is measured at each sample time based on the real - world dynamic system ( see example in section [ se : example ] ) .",
    "-0.3 cm the kkt conditions of problem [ eq : param_prob ] can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 if @xmath39 and @xmath40 if @xmath41 , is the normal cone of @xmath30 at @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is a lagrange multiplier associated with @xmath44 .",
