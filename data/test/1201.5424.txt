    "roughly one - third of _ kepler _ s planet candidates announced by @xcite are associated with targets that have more than one candidate planet .",
    "false positives ( fps ) plague ground - based transit searches , but the exquisite quality of _ kepler  _ photometry , combined with the ability to measure small deviations in center of light during transits @xcite , have been used to cleanse the sample prior to presentation in @xcite .",
    "accounting for candidates on each one s individual merit , @xcite estimated the fidelity of _ kepler _ s planet candidates ( fraction of the candidates expected to be actual planets ) to be above @xmath0 .",
    "yet the fidelity of multiple planet candidates is likely to be higher than that for singles @xcite .",
    "we show herein that the vast majority of _ kepler _ s multiple planet candidates are true multiple planet systems .",
    "the majority of _ kepler  _ planet discoveries announced to date have been confirmed dynamically , using radial velocity variations of the target star or departures of observed transit times from a linear ephemeris ( transit timing variations , ttvs ) .",
    "however , three of the first sixteen _ kepler  _ planets do not have dynamical evidence supporting the discovery , but rather these planets have been `` validated '' by showing that the probability that the observed signal is produced by a planet around the host star is at least 100 times as large as that of a false positive @xcite .",
    "for these three planets , the validation process was based on the results of the blender code , which performs detailed comparisons between the observed _",
    "kepler  _ lightcurve and the lightcurves predicted for an ensemble of theoretically conceivable fps to reject fp models that are not consistent with the observations .",
    "blender then sums the _ a priori _ probability for the allowed false positives and compares that to the _ a priori _ probability for the planet model .",
    "blender validates a planet when the resulting odds ratio very strongly favors the planet model . although all three of these planets orbit stars that also have dynamically - confirmed planets , planetary multiplicity was not used quantitatively to aid in their validation .",
    "@xcite do a more cursory analysis , but one that is far easier , enabling them to perform it for all of the candidate planets ( `` candidates '' , henceforth ) that are listed in the @xcite paper .",
    "the study by @xcite assumes a flat 20% planet occurrence rate as a prior for their bayesian analysis ( i.e. , the average number of planets per star is assumed to be 0.2 ) , and they do not consider planets orbiting background stars to be fps .",
    "@xcite use the depth and period of the transit , together with the magnitude , stellar properties and galactic latitude of the target star ( henceforth `` target '' ) to provide an upper bound on the fp prior ; for high snr transits , this upper bound on the fp prior can be much higher than the one computed using detailed lightcurve matching by blender to rule out many fp scenarios @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite do not examine _ kepler  _ lightcurves , but rather assume for their calculations that various false - positive vetting procedures using _",
    "kepler  _ photometry have been done , such as elimination of candidates with v - shaped lightcurves or where the centroid of light received on the _ kepler  _ focal plane is in a different position during a transit than it is outside of transit , and that the planet candidates show no evidence for being fps .",
    "however , these cuts were not applied to all of the candidates listed in @xcite .",
    "some candidates were not vetted as extensively as assumed by @xcite , and other candidates did not pass one of the cleanness tests but still remain viable , if somewhat more suspect , planetary candidates ( e.g. , grazing planetary transits , as well as grazing stellar eclipses , produce v - shaped lightcurves ) , and thus remain on @xcite s candidate list .",
    "we develop herein a quantitative method to estimate the true planet fraction of the overall sample of _ kepler  _ candidate multiple planets that is based upon the observation that there are far more multiples than would be expected for a random distribution of candidates among _",
    "kepler  _ targets @xcite .",
    "this `` overabundance '' of multiples is illustrated by the fact that fewer than 1% of targets have a candidate on @xcite s candidate list , whereas more than 15% of targets with at least one candidate have multiple candidates , and more than 25% of targets with at least two candidates have a third candidate .",
    "such a result is expected if planets often appear within systems of planets , especially if such systems tend to be flat in the distribution of inclinations .",
    "high multiplicity , low inclination , planetary systems are consistent with _",
    "kepler  _ observations @xcite .",
    "we describe an approach to validation of specific multiple planet system candidates that is intermediate between those of @xcite and blender , and we apply these techniques to validate the very flat and dynamically - packed koi-707 system . in this approach ,",
    "applied herein exclusively to koi-707 , we examine the target and candidates individually , supplementing the _ kepler  _ input catalog ( kic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with spectroscopic observations of the target and high - resolution imaging , including keck guider camera exposures and speckle imaging @xcite and/or adaptive optics @xcite , to search for other stars in the target aperture .",
    "we check the lightcurve for a shape consistent with a transit .",
    "we verify that the centroid motion is nil or consistent with a transit around the target star and not a transit/ eclipse of any other stars observed nearby .",
    "but we do not perform detailed matching of observed lightcurves to fp scenarios .",
    "we then use multiplicity to effectively increase the planet priors and allow for validation in a bayesian sense . note that for candidate giant ( @xmath1 1 jupiter radius ) planets",
    ", one would need to consider the possibility of the transit signal being produced by a late m star partially eclipsing the target star ( perhaps with dilution ) ; for smaller candidates , the possibility of transits of fainter stars by larger planets must be taken into account .",
    "the probability of a candidate in a multiple system being a false positive is contrasted to that of a single candidate in section 2 .",
    "other factors involved in validating transiting planet candidates are discussed in section 3 .",
    "we apply our method to the koi-707 candidate multi - planet system in section 4 .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a summary of our results and a discussion of their implications .",
    "_ kepler  _ has found far more multiple candidate systems than would be the case if candidates were randomly distributed among target stars @xcite .",
    "false positives are expected to be nearly randomly distributed among _",
    "kepler  _ targets , whereas true transiting planets could be clustered if planets whose sizes and periods are adequate for transits to be detected often come in multiples , as is the case for planets detected by radial velocity variations @xcite , and/or if planetary systems tend to be flat , so geometry leads to higher transit probabilities for other planets if one planet is seen to transit @xcite .",
    "we quantify the excess of multiples and its implications for the overall fidelity of the sample of multiple candidates in this section .",
    "we use the following notation and input parameters : the number of planet candidates is @xmath2 , the number of targets with two or more candidates , i.e. , the number of candidate multiple planet systems , is @xmath3 , and the number of targets from which the sample is drawn is @xmath4 = 160,171 .",
    "these numerical values are taken from @xcite , who removed from the 1235 candidates listed in @xcite those objects that were estimated to have radii greater than twice that of jupiter , those for which only one transit had been observed , and those identified as fps by @xcite .",
    "we denote the number of actual planets among the candidates as @xmath5 , the number of false positives as @xmath6 , and the fidelity of the sample ( fraction of candidates that are planets ) as @xmath7 , so @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    for our calculations in equations ( 19 ) , we make the following two assumptions :    \\i ) fps are randomly distributed among the targets ;    \\ii ) there is no correlation between the probability of a target to host one or more detectable planets and to display fps .",
    "in contrast , we do not assume that planets are randomly distributed among the targets .",
    "the previous verifications of the two - planet kepler-10 system @xcite , the three - planet kepler-9 @xcite and kepler-18 systems @xcite , and especially the six - planet kepler-11 system @xcite , provide strong evidence of the non - random distribution of transiting planets among _",
    "kepler  _ target stars .",
    "the above two assumptions , together with observed values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath4 and an assumed lower bound on @xmath7 , allow us to estimate lower bounds on the fidelity of candidates in various classes of candidate multi - planet systems using simple algebra .",
    "for example , assumption ( 1 ) implies that the expected number of targets with @xmath12 false positives , @xmath13 , is given by a poisson distribution of @xmath4 members whose mean is given by the average number of false positives per target , @xmath14 .",
    "this expectation value is given by the following formula :    @xmath15    where the approximation in equation ( 1 ) is valid for @xmath16 .",
    "we next compute the expected number of _ kepler  _ targets with multiple candidates at least one of which is a fp . in some cases ,",
    "we make approximations that yield conservative estimates of the expected numbers of true planets ( i.e. , overestimate the expected number of fps ) .",
    "our results , presented in equations ( 27 ) , are given first as general formulae , then as a function of the fraction of candidates that are true planets , @xmath7 , for the observed values of 160,171 targets , 1199 candidates , and 170 multiple candidate systems stated above , and finally these value if @xmath7 = 0.5 or 0.9 because we consider it to be a reasonable estimate of the actual planet fidelity rate , and @xmath17 to show that even for an overall fp rate far higher than studies suggest , the expected number of fps among the multis is remarkably low . ] .",
    "these final numbers are to be compared to the observation that there are 115 candidate 2-planet systems , with a total of 230 planet candidates , and 55 candidate systems of 3 or more transiting planets , with a total of 178 planet candidates .",
    "equation ( 1 ) yields estimates of the number of targets with two or three false positives :    @xmath18    @xmath19    the number of targets expected to have four or more false positives is very small and can be neglected for our purposes .",
    "equation ( 1 ) also yields the expected number of targets with a single fp under the same assumptions , 597.3 or 119.8 .",
    "the assumed lack of correlation between the propensity of a target to have false positives and true planets implies that the probability that a given target hosts both a planet and one or more false positive is equal to the product of these individual probabilities .",
    "the probability of a target having a detected transiting planet is given by @xmath20 , and the probability of it showing a false positive is given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "thus , the estimated numbers of targets with at least one planet as well as one or more false positives are given by :    @xmath21    @xmath22    the number of targets expected to have both a planet and three or more false positives is very small and can be neglected for our purposes .",
    "somewhat lower estimates of the number of multi- candidate systems with one planet and at least one fp than given by equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) can be derived by noting that the observed multiplicity implies fewer ( than @xmath10 ) targets with a nonzero number of planet candidates .    to derive an estimate of the expected number of targets with multiple true planets as well as at least one fp ,",
    "replace the term in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) that represents the probability of a given target having a true planet , @xmath20 , with a term representing the probability of a given target having a multi - planet system , @xmath23 .",
    "( assuming all multis are multi - planet systems to estimate of this term is conservative in the sense that it may lead to an overestimate in the number of false positives in multi - candidate systems . )",
    "@xmath24    @xmath25    the number of targets expected to have both multiple planets and three or more false positives is extremely small and can be neglected for our purposes .",
    "adding up the above estimates of fps of different types yields expected totals of 4.5 or 0.9 fps ( for assumed fp rates of 50% and 10% , respectively ) in doubles ( compared to a total of 230 candidates ) and 0.65 or 0.13 fps in systems with three or more candidates ( compared to a total of 178 candidates ) .",
    "these numbers suggest that validation of doubles at the 99% level by this method alone is marginal .",
    "triples and higher multiplicity candidates are more strongly validatable , enough so that the one dynamically - unstable candidate triple system noted by @xcite , koi-284 , which has a pair of candidates with a period ratio @xmath26 , should be viewed as somewhat surprising ( but see section 2.4 ) .",
    "it is of interest to compare the ( low ) false positive rates for multis estimated in the previous paragraph with the presumed fp rates for singles upon which their calculations are based . for 50% fps in singles , our estimates above correspond to 2% fps in doubles ( compare the first numbers at the end of equations 2 and 4 with the 230 candidates in _",
    "kepler  _ candidate 2-planet systems ) and 0.4% fps for targets with three or more candidates ( compare the first numbers at the end equations 3 and 57 with the 178 candidates in _",
    "kepler  _ candidate 3 or more planet systems ) ; for 10% fps in singles , we estimate 0.4% fps in doubles ( compare the final numbers at the end of equations 2 and 4 with the 230 candidates in _",
    "kepler  _ candidate 2-planet systems ) and 0.1% for targets with three or more candidates ( compare the final numbers at the end equations 3 and 57 with the 178 candidates in _",
    "kepler  _ candidate 3 or more planet systems ) .",
    "these values are consistent with a `` multiplicity boost '' in the bayesian prior for planets of @xmath1 25 for a system with one additional candidate and of @xmath1 100 for a system with more than one additional candidate .",
    "the probability that a target hosts a planet candidate , 1/150 , can be compared to the probability of a target that hosts one candidate hosts another , 1/6 , and that an additional candidate has been found for higher multiplicity systems , 1/3 .",
    "these latter values , together with the assumption that fps and true planets are uncorrelated , lead to an estimate of the multiplicity boost for candidate doubles of 30 , slightly larger than the value of 25 computed above , and to a somewhat reduced estimate of @xmath1 50 for candidates in systems of higher multiplicity .",
    "the multiplicity boost introduced in the previous paragraph can be used to quantify the increased probability that a set of transit - like signatures represent a real transiting planet if one or more additional set of transit - like signatures are detected for the same _ kepler  _ target ; i.e. , to compute an estimate the probability of a particular candidate in a multiple candidate system being a true planet from an estimate of that candidate being a planet that does not account for multiplicity .",
    "we denote the probability of planethood of the candidate in question computed without factoring in multiplicity by @xmath27 and the probability of it being a planet accounting for multiplicity by @xmath28 if it is in a two candidate system and by @xmath29 if it is a member of a three or more candidate system . in our formulation ,",
    "multiplicity effectively increases the bayesian estimate of the planet prior but leaves the fp prior unchanged .",
    "thus the probability of the planet interpretation accounting for multiplicity is related to that neglecting multiplicity according to the following approximate formulae : @xmath30 @xmath31 where in each case we use the smaller value computed in the previous paragraph .",
    "rough estimates for the planet probabilities of individual _",
    "kepler  _ candidate multis can be obtained by applying expressions ( 8) and ( 9 ) to the estimates of planet probability by @xcite ; the @xcite planet probabilities are given by @xmath27 in the above formulae since their numbers do not account for multiplicity .",
    "note that this multiplicity boost incorporates self - consistently both the coplanarity boost discussed in @xcite and the systems boost ( that planets tend to come in systems ) without need to disentangle these effects .",
    "the above calculations of the multiplicity boost do not assume that any of the candidates of the target under consideration have been confirmed or validated as planets .",
    "does validating one or more candidate as a true planet(s ) substantially increase the probability that other candidates of the same target are also planets ? for realistic estimates of fp rates ( e.g. , 10% ) , the equations above show that most fps in multis are likely to be combinations of 1 fp with one or more true planets , so validating one candidate does not substantially increase confidence in the others from a statistical viewpoint .",
    "nonetheless , validating one candidate does eliminate some of the non - statistical issues raised in the following three subsections .",
    "in particular , if that validated candidate is shown to not only be a planet but also to orbit the _ kepler  _ target star , then the probability that the other candidates are physically - associated with the target increases .      to examine the validity of the three assumptions stated above , we divide fps into two classes , ( i ) chance - alignment blends such as background eclipsing binaries ( bgebs ) and ( ii ) physical triple stars ( pts ) , where grazing eclipses of the target star by a stellar companion are considered together with pts for this purpose .",
    "we note that it is a matter of choice how to count cases where the transit signal is produced by a planet transiting a star other than the _",
    "kepler  _ target .",
    "larger planets transiting stars that are not physically associated with the star providing most of the target s flux can be considered to fall within the chance - alignment blends / bgeb class of fps ( as they must be for _ kepler _ s statistical census of planets , because background stars are not in the denominator of the ratio taken to calculate the fraction of stars with planets , so their planets must not be included in the numerator ) , or alternatively not be regarded as fps when assessing individual candidates and the reliability of the sample .",
    "planets transiting physical companions to the star providing most of the flux can either be viewed as members of the pt class of fps or not classified as fps ; how these planets are categorized for _ kepler _ s statistical census of planets is also a matter of choice .    assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) lead to the following caveats :    ( i ) : the expected number of bgebs ( chance - alignment blends ) that can cause fps varies with the magnitude and galactic latitude of the target star , whereas those of pts do not ( except to the extent that the distribution of stellar types among _",
    "kepler  _ targets depends somewhat on magnitude ) .",
    "the variations in expected bgebs act to increase the expected total number of systems with 2 or more fps compared to the value given by the above formulae .",
    "when looking at individual candidate systems , the fp probability of those around faint targets and at low galactic latitude is larger , whereas the planetary interpretation becomes more likely for brighter targets and those at higher galactic latitude .",
    "however , the distributions in galactic latitude of the planet candidates and of the multiple candidate systems both track that of all _ kepler  _ targets , whereas the distribution of expected bgeb fps is quite different ( figure 1 ) ; this suggests that the fraction of candidates ( both singles and multis ) that are produced by bgebs is small .",
    "binomial variation ) of each of the planet candidate curves at quartile points in their distributions .",
    "the basic shape of the three solid curves is governed by the orientation of the _ kepler  _ field on the sky , where the amount of area covered increases from a point at galactic latitude @xmath32 to a region spanning @xmath33 in longitude at @xmath34 in galactic latitude and then decreases to a point at @xmath35 latitude ; the second most important factor is a weighting towards the galactic plane because of the higher spatial density of target stars in that portion of the field .",
    "the dashed curve is more heavily weighted towards the galactic plane because , to first approximation , it is weighted quadratically in the spatial density of stars ( more precisely , the product of the spatial densities of target stars and background stars ) , whereas the other curves are only weighted linearly .",
    "the spatial density of background stars drops by a factor of 17 from the lowest latitude _",
    "kepler  _ observes to the highest latitude .",
    "the similarity of curves for targets , planets and multis , and the difference of these from the curve estimating bgeb fps , suggests that the fraction of candidates that are produced by bgebs ( as well as that resulting from planets transiting background stars ) is small . ]    the statistical analysis that we presented above does not discriminate between multiple candidates resulting from multiple planets orbiting a background star and a single candidate resulting from a single planet orbiting a background star .",
    "however , the correlations and lack thereof between the curves shown in figure 1 also imply that the fraction of kois caused by single or multiple planets transiting a background star is small . in some cases , it is especially unlikely that a multiple candidate system is produced by several planets orbiting a background star , either because its largest member would be greater than planetary in size , or because the requirement of dynamical stability would imply implausibly small densities for the larger planets orbiting the fainter star . additionally , as the fraction of giant planets among the multis is smaller than it is for the singles @xcite , the probability of a multi being a system of larger planets orbiting a fainter star is less than that of a single candidate orbiting a star fainter than the target .",
    "a second class of multiple fps can be produced from a single physical system , either a triple star with two sets of eclipses or a background star with multiple transiting planets .",
    "triple star systems are unstable for small period ratios and produce large eclipse timing variations for moderate period ratios , so if large timing variations are not detected , we do not need to consider triple star system fps ( nor grazing eclipsing binary stars with a transiting planet ) unless period ratios are large .",
    "quadruple star systems consisting of two pairs of eclipsing binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could produce a small excess probability of a pair of fps .",
    "such systems , as well as line of sight pairs of physically - unrelated ebs , also might be more likely to mimic planetary - depth transits because of mutual dilution of the fraction of light in the _ kepler  _ aperture .",
    "we note also that fps are inherently more likely among both small ( earth - size and smaller ) and large ( jupiter - size and larger ) candidates than among intermediate ( neptune - size ) candidates , independent of multiplicity .",
    "most small candidates produce low - amplitude transits that reduce our ability to remove false positives from the candidate list on the basis of the shape of the lightcurve or from differences in the centroid of the location of the dip relative to that of the target .",
    "small candidates , including multis , are more likely to be planets orbiting stars fainter than the target simply because the neptune - size planets that could produce such signals are far more common according to _",
    "kepler  _ observations than are giant planets @xcite , and this difference in abundance is even larger for the multis than for the singles @xcite . at the other extreme of the planet size distribution ,",
    "giant candidates appear to be more contaminated by stellar false positives @xcite of the type which plague ground - based surveys than do neptune - size candidates .",
    "( ii ) : planets and fps of both types are more easily detectable for quieter targets ; planets and pts are more detectable for brighter targets , but bgebs that are bright enough to mimic observable transits of the target star are more likely for fainter targets . a grazing eclipsing binary with a circumstellar or circumbinary transiting planet analogous to kepler-16",
    "@xcite would violate our assumption of a lack of correlation between planets and fps , but such a configuration requires a large period ratio for stability and an even larger period ratio for the planet to have modest ttvs .",
    "the assumption of no correlation between planets and fps would be violated if the orientations of orbital planes of pts with one star having a planet are not random .",
    "alignments of planetary orbital planes for binary stars for which both stars possess planets also violate this assumption , although members of this class are true planets that are all physically associated ( albeit less directly ) with the target star and thus would for many purposes not be classified as fps .",
    "the numbers quoted in equations ( 29 ) do not incorporate the caveats noted in this subsection .",
    "correlations between the propensity of a target to have one or more fps and to host one or more identified true planets ( ii ) are likely to be at most a factor of a few .",
    "false positives of the bgeb class are likely to be concentrated among faint target stars that are located at low galactic latitude @xcite ; this concentration increases the expected number of targets with two ( or more ) fps , but also points to a substantial portion of _ kepler _ s target list whose members have _ a priori _ fp likelihood that is lower than or comparable to those given by the numbers above .",
    "the distribution of candidate period ratios exhibits spikes near strong mean motion resonances , which implies that candidates with such period ratios are more likely to be true planets than those candidates not in or very near such resonances @xcite .",
    "this clustering can be used to increase confidence in candidates with periods near resonances ; such a `` near - resonance boost '' can be quantified using the measured values of the normalized distance from resonance computed from the distribution of planet period ratios in @xcite .",
    "candidate resonant planets can , however , arise from period aliases in analysis of light curves ; such aliases are not of the form of the astrophysical fps considered in this paper , and we note that special care to search for them is an important aspect of validating candidate resonant planets ( see the discussion of koi-730 and the note added in proof in @xcite )",
    ".    resonant period ratios increase confidence in various candidates , and as mentioned at the beginning of section 2.1 , one of the candidate systems , koi-284 , is highly suspect because two of the candidates have periods that differ from one another by @xmath36 , which would rapidly lead to a dynamical instability on a very short time scale ( but see the discussion of this system in section 2.4 ) .",
    "do non - resonant periods reduce the confidence in individual multis and do stable systems produce an increase in our confidence ?",
    "the answers to both parts of this question are yes , but in most cases these effects are minor .",
    "while resonances are overpopulated , a substantial majority of multis are not in nor near such resonances @xcite . and",
    "while drawing planetary periods randomly from the observed ensemble of transiting planet periods gives many more nominally unstable systems than are observed , the fraction of unstable configurations from such a random draw is still small .",
    "nonetheless , in high - multiplicity densely - packed systems , wherein most configurations with the same number of planets randomly spread over the same range in period would likely be unstable , the boost in confidence from stability can be significant .",
    "note that special period ratio boosts and stability boosts are in addition to the standard multiplicity boost , i.e. , they can be applied together as two multiplicative factors in the planet prior for appropriate systems .      a very rough estimate of the expected number of multiple candidate systems that orbit different members of a binary / multiple star system ( rather than a single system of planets orbiting the same star ) can be made by assuming that half of _ kepler _ s targets are binaries , that each star within a binary is as likely to host both single and multiple transiting planets as are single stars , and that the probability of one star within a binary hosting transiting planets is uncorrelated with that of its binary companion .",
    "these assumptions imply @xmath10 planets spread around @xmath37 stars , and thus @xmath38 planets per star and @xmath39 cases in which multis are composed of planets transiting differing members of a stellar binary .",
    "positive correlations between the propensity of stars in a binary to have transiting planets ( resulting from the abundance of planets and/or alignment of orbital planes ) would increase this number , but the fact that a significant majority of binaries are composed of stars of substantially differing surface brightness combined with the paucity of giant planets transiting low luminosity stars should reduce the number of multis comprised of two planetary systems because of the difficulty of detecting planets around secondary stars .    as mentioned above , koi-284 , with three planetary candidates having periods of 6.18 , 6.42 , 18.0 days and nominal sizes of @xmath1 2 r@xmath40 ( earth radii ) , is the only one of 170 multi - candidate system identified in @xcite that would be clearly dynamically unstable if all of the planets orbited the same star @xcite 0.0012 days .",
    "the revised period places the planets much farther apart , and the system is stable with the updated parameters . ] .",
    "analysis of a mcdonald observatory spectrum of this bright ( _ kepler  _ magnitude @xmath41 ) target yields a temperature of @xmath1 6250 k and log@xmath42 , which suggest a f7v star that is twice as luminous as the sun .",
    "speckle images of koi-284 obtained on 24 june 2010 revealed two stars differing in brightness by less than one magnitude and separated from one another by slightly less than 1@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of each individual star obtained at keck in 2011 show the two stars to have nearly identical spectra and have a difference in radial velocity of 0.94 @xmath44 0.1 km / s .",
    "the nearly identical velocities are consistent with their being gravitationally bound .",
    "their separation of @xmath45 at a distance of roughly 500 pc implies a projected separation of 450 au ; the relative orbital velocities for two 1 @xmath46 stars on a circular orbit with semimajor axis @xmath47 = 450 au is 2 km / s .",
    "these observations suggest that the three candidates may well all be transiting planets in the same stellar system , with one of the stars hosting one of the six day period planets and the other two planets orbiting the other star in the binary .",
    "thus , this system would not call into question the statistical arguments presented in section 2.1 . a detailed analysis of both _",
    "kepler  _ and ground - based data to test this hypothesis and elucidate particulars is currently underway @xcite .",
    "the numbers derived in section 2 suggest that the sample of multi - planet candidates identified by @xcite is likely to include only a small fraction of false positives , of order 1% .",
    "but because of the uncertainties associated with the caveats discussed in section 2 , as well as any factors that we may have omitted , we do not consider it appropriate to view all of _ kepler _ s multi - planet candidates to be validated planets at the 99% level .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible to identify candidates with various favorable characteristics as detailed below , and to examine the available data for systems individually for signs of potential inconsistencies with the planet hypothesis .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of transit characteristics .",
    "the shape and duration of a candidate transit can be used to distinguish events produced by planets from false positives produced by known astrophysical sources .",
    "the blender code @xcite compares the observed lightcurve to synthetic lightcurves of both a planet transiting the target star and a vast array of possible astrophysical false positives involving binary stars and larger planets transiting fainter stars .",
    "if the planet hypothesis does not provide an acceptable fit to the data , the candidate is not viable ; candidates for which the planet fit is marginal are called into question , and such candidates are not considered further herein .",
    "astrophysical false positives are considered credible if they provide an acceptable fit ( 3@xmath48 ) to the data .",
    "then the _ a priori _ likelihoods of the planet hypothesis and that of a false positive are compared , and a probability that the apparent transit is caused by a blend is computed .",
    "the process can be very involved , especially for candidates with orbital periods long enough that astrophysical false positives could plausibly be produced by objects with eccentric ( not tidally - damped ) orbits @xcite .",

    "the five planetary candidates of koi-707 are extremely likely to represent a true 5 planet system orbiting the target star .",
    "there are several lines of evidence that support this conclusion .",
    "first , the analysis presented in section 2 implies that the overwhelming majority of _ kepler  _ multiple - planet candidates are true planets and bound within the same physical system .",
    "second , the planetary system is already closely - packed dynamically for the sizes of planets around an undiluted target star ( see section 4.4 ) . were the planetary system to orbit another star that is not seen because it is significantly fainter than the target",
    ", the larger planets required to match the observations would necessitate implausibly low densities for the planetary system to be stable .",
    "third , the spatial location analysis presented in section 4.1 , combined with the galactic latitude distribution of targets and planet candidates shown in figure 1 and the relatively high galactic latitude of koi-707 ( 15@xmath91 ) , together imply that it is unlikely that the signals are due to a source not physically associated with the target star .",
    "fourth , the long durations of the transits relative to the planets orbital periods imply that they are produced by light being blocked from a star whose density is significantly less than those of cool dwarfs , and/or they are produced by apocentric transits of objects with substantial orbital eccentricity .",
    "substantial orbital eccentricities would make the system unstable if the planets orbited the same star .",
    "it is highly implausible that two stars in an unresolved stellar binary would be so similarly coeval to have nearly equal densities characteristic of a somewhat evolved star .",
    "fifth , the remarkable similarity of the transit durations when appropriately scaled to orbital periods ( expression ( 10 ) and figure 8) can be understood as the consequence of an ensemble of planets transiting the same star with similar impact parameters , but would otherwise be an unlikely coincidence .",
    "the above characteristics of koi-707.0105 , combined with the overall high validity of _ kepler  _ multis , imply that these candidates have a well above 99% probability of composing a true multi - planet system , hence we consider these candidates to be validated planets and name the system kepler-33 .",
    "numerical integrations to test stability of the system were performed using masses of the planets from the nominal mass - radius relationship based upon planets within our solar system presented in @xcite .",
    "this relationship is given by :    @xmath92    where r@xmath40 and m@xmath40 are the radius and mass of the earth , respectively .",
    "in previous work , @xcite integrated the koi-707 system using parameters based on the data presented by @xcite and assuming planar initially circular orbits ; the model system survived intact for the entire @xmath93 years simulated .",
    "all of our integrations also assume that the system is planar .",
    "for all planets having zero initial eccentricity , all three models of the system listed in tables 2 and 3 survived intact for the entire @xmath94 years simulated .",
    "of the three kepler-33 planetary system models that we integrated , the one based directly on the spectroscopic stellar parameters had the largest planetary sizes and thus largest estimated planetary masses , with the fractional differences in estimated planetary masses from one model to another being larger than those for stellar mass .",
    "thus , the spectroscopic parameters yielded the largest interplanetary perturbations , and presumably the largest ttv signatures .",
    "we examined distributions of ttv signals over 2 year periods during the first 2 myr of this simulation .",
    "these theoretical ttvs for the inner planet were smaller than 30 seconds , and those for kepler-33c less than 90 seconds , both values below current measurement capabilities .",
    "the outer three planets exhibited far larger ttvs , 9  18 minutes for kepler-33d , 23  38 minutes for kepler-33e and 23  35 minutes for kepler-33f , roughly consistent with variations detected .",
    "while this model used relatively high mass estimates , the integration began with circular orbits , which produce smaller ttvs , so the results do not yield a preference between the three models of planetary sizes listed in table 3 .",
    "a detailed analysis of planetary ttvs is beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that it may well soon be possible to derive estimates of the masses of some or all of the outer three planets using observed ttvs .",
    "the properties of the 5 planet kepler-33 system are analogous to those of the 6 planet kepler-11 system @xcite .",
    "both systems include 4 planets with orbital periods between 13 and 47 days that are comparable in radius to , or somewhat smaller in size than , neptune , as well as a smaller planet closer to the star .",
    "both systems are thus very closely - packed in a dynamical sense .",
    "the kepler-11 system is slightly more dynamically close - packed than is the kepler-33 system , both in the sense that the ratios of the orbital periods of neighboring planets are a bit larger for kepler-33 s planets @xcite and as evidenced from smaller ttvs detected in the kepler-33 system .    in some aspects",
    ", the kepler-33 system can be viewed as a less extreme cousin of kepler-11 , with 5 known transiting planets rather than 6 and spacing that not quite as close , yet dynamically much tighter than most systems @xcite . however , the new system s inner planet , kepler-33b , is smaller and closer to its star than is its counterpart , kepler-11b .",
    "the high density of kepler-11b relative to its brethren , coupled with its smaller size , indicates a composition richer in heavy elements @xcite . while the mass and thus the density of kepler-33b is not known , it is unlikely that a planet this small ( @xmath95 ) and close ( 0.07 au ) to its bright star ( 3 l@xmath68 ) could have retained a substantial h / he atmosphere .",
    "this lends support to the suggestion by @xcite that planets such as kepler-11b may have once had atmospheres of light gases that subsequently escaped as a result of stellar irradiation .",
    "the slightly shorter normalized duration of the small inner planet kepler-33b suggests that this planet has somewhat larger inclination and/or eccentricity than do the outer four planets .",
    "we note that mercury , the innermost and smallest planet in our solar system , also has the largest eccentricity and inclination of the 8 planets known to orbit our sun .",
    "stability of the kepler-33 planetary system excludes large eccentricities of the four outer planets , although interplanetary perturbations must cause eccentricities to be non - zero . the remarkable similarity in the normalized transit durations of the five planets",
    "orbiting kepler-33 would be very unlikely if the eccentricities and inclinations of planetary orbits are significant ( figure 9 ) .",
    "moreover , the consequent similarity in computed impact parameters despite the planets differing orbital distances requires that either the system is viewed near edge - on , with impact parameters @xmath96 , or a very fortuitous coincidence producing an anticorrelation between inclinations and orbital periods .",
    "we view such a coincidence as unlikely , and therefore prefer the planetary parameters closer to those listed in final two columns of tables 2 and 3 ( the `` flat '' fits ) than to those listed in the second column of tables 2 and 3 .     case .",
    "the blue triangles , yellow diamonds and red squares show results from simulations in which the eccentricity assigned to each planet was drawn form a rayleigh distribution with mean value @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the addition of even a small range of eccentricities greatly reduces probability of highly correlated transit durations . ]",
    "the calculations presented in section 2 show that the vast majority of _ kepler _ s multi - planet candidates are indeed planets .",
    "the essence of our argument is that fewer than 10@xmath100 of _ kepler  _ targets have a planet candidate listed in @xcite . if 10% or fewer of these candidates are fps , then fewer than 10@xmath101 of _ kepler  _ targets have a false positive , and if fps are not correlated with other planet candidates , then fewer than 10@xmath102 of _ kepler _",
    "s @xmath1 160,000 targets , i.e. , a total of at most 2 targets , are expected to have a false positive as well as another transit - like signature that makes them a candidate multi - planet system .",
    "this number can be compared to 170 candidate multi - planet systems with a total of 408 planet candidates announced by @xcite .",
    "accurate estimates of the false positive rate in this population require detailed analysis of both _",
    "kepler  _ and ground - based data to account for the caveats expressed in section 2.2 .",
    "nonetheless , we expect that @xmath103 of the 408 planet candidates in multis that were announced by @xcite are indeed exoplanets , although a small fraction of these planets orbit stars other than their nominal _ kepler  _ target star .",
    "note that the smallest planet candidates are most prone to false positives , because low snr limits the restrictiveness in parameter space of tests of lightcurve shape and location of the centroid of the transit signal on the sky plane , and the abundance of astrophysical signals that are capable of producing lower amplitude events is greater",
    ". also note that stellar parameters , and thus planetary sizes , are prone to large uncertainties for candidates that have no high - snr spectroscopic observations from the ground .    from a bayesian statistical perspective",
    ", multiplicity effectively allows us to increase the planet prior , and thus enables the validation of candidates as being true planets at a specified high probability level without going to the extreme lengths often required to provide a very small upper bound on the fp prior .",
