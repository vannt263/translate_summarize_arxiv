    "what has been available to eso up to now are efficiency curves provided by the vimos consortium that are averaged over the four quadrants and were determined with laboratory measurements , not by observing standard stars .",
    "prompted by user requests to have separate efficiency estimates for each quadrant , two spectrophotometric standard stars were observed in 2006 : hiltner 600 for all filters , and ltt7379 for the u and b band .",
    "these observations were performed with the broadest possible slit ( 5@xmath0 ) and the grisms lr - blue ( for u , b , and v ) and lr - red ( for r , i , and z ) . under the assumption that the total star - light is contained in the slit , the efficiency curve is derived from the measured flux .",
    "the required input consists of the tabulated standard star flux , the extinction curve , and the grism transmission as provided by the vimos consortium .",
    "the resulting curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ smieske : fig1 ] .",
    "they are also available from the public vimos web - pages .",
    "there is good agreement between the newly derived efficiency estimates and those from the consortium .",
    "the substantial sensitivity drop in quadrant 3 for the u - band is found independently for both ltt 7379 and hiltner 600 ( note that the measurement for hiltner 600 was not used for the efficiency estimate in the u - band since it suffered from flux loss in all four quadrants , due to a slight misalignment of the standard within the slit ) . since the u - band photometric zero - points for q3",
    "do not show such a strong drop , a centring problem due to instrument flexure is a possible reason for this lack of measured flux .",
    "in addition , the consortium estimate of the grism transmission in q3 for l@xmath13800  may be too high .",
    "we suggest that the efficiency estimates especially in the u - band be always re - scaled to the ( integrated ) photometric zero - points .",
    "in addition to the total instrument+telescope efficiency estimates , we used the continuum lamp screen flats taken with and without inserted filter to measure the filter transmissions for each quadrant .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ smieske : fig3 ] and compared with the consortium estimates .",
    "there is very good agreement for the v , r , i , and z filters . for the u - band ,",
    "the consortium estimates are about 20% above those derived from the screen flats . also for the b - band , the consortium estimates are about 5 - 10% higher .    unlike in the consortium filter transmission curves from fig .",
    "[ smieske : fig3 ] , we do _ not _ detect a red leak of the u - band filter around 4200  . only in q4 , there is a very minor leak at about 4850  ( see fig .  [",
    "smieske : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the measured telescope+instrument efficiency curves for the vimos broad band filters agree very well with the consortium estimates . a discrepancy in the u - band",
    "is observed for one quadrant , possibly due to flexure and low grism transmission at short wavelengthes .",
    "the filter transmissions also agree very well , except for the b and especially u - band , where the newly measured transmission is about 20% lower ."
