    "@xcite have observed spontaneously generated delocalized magnetic flux in what they call asymmetric @xmath0 grain boundaries in yba@xmath1cu@xmath20@xmath3 ( ybco ) .",
    "they have explained the existence of this flux in terms of a superconducting order parameter having @xmath4 symmetry and grain boundaries which are faceted .",
    "the geometry of their experiment and of their explanation is indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "in the words of ref .",
    "@xcite , `` for a @xmath5-wave superconductor , a lobe of the order parameter is normal to the boundary on one side , while a node is normal on the other .",
    "faceting of the grain boundary produces slight variations of the grain boundary angle , rocking the local normal from the positive lobe to the negative lobe , varying the local critical current from positive to negative , producing a series of 0 and @xmath6-junctions and spontaneous magnetization . ''",
    "@xcite notes that the variation of the magnetic flux along the grain boundary is described by the equation  @xcite @xmath7 \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the distance measured along the grain boundary , @xmath9 is the gauge - invariant phase difference across the boundary at point @xmath8 , and @xmath10 is the josephson penetration depth .",
    "the idea that the variations of the grain boundary angle cause the local critical current to vary from positive to negative is incorporated into this equation by taking @xmath11 to be zero when the critical current is positive , and @xmath6 where the critical current is negative .",
    "the flux in the grain boundary , integrated from one end of the grain boundary up to the point @xmath8 , is given by @xmath12 where the @xmath13 is the elementary flux quantum . in a realistic model of a grain boundary , @xmath10 would be a function of @xmath8 ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) but this dependence is neglected in the present article .    the purpose of this article is to present an alternative physical model which also leads to spontaneous flux generation in asymmetric 45@xmath14 twin boundaries , and which could thus also account for the experimentally observed behavior . in this alternative model , which also leads to eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , the changes of @xmath11 from 0 to @xmath6 occur where twin boundaries from one side of the grain boundary contact the grain boundary ( twin boundaries on the other side of the grain boundary do not cause @xmath11 to change ) .",
    "the details of how this twin - boundary mechanism works depend on the fact that ybco is orthorhombic , and also on the assumption that the twin boundaries in ybco have odd reflection symmetry ( _ e.g. _ see refs .",
    "the essential idea is that , given these assumptions , the point @xmath15 of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) can be viewed as a meeting point of three josephson junctions , an odd number of which must be @xmath6 junctions . under these circumstances",
    ", it is known from the work of refs .",
    "@xcite that the superconducting ground state will have a vortex containing a flux @xmath16 at the meeting point of the junctions .",
    "consider the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . on the left side of the grain boundary",
    "there are two distinct twins separated by a twin boundary and characterized by their ginzburg - landau order parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively ; the superconductor on the right side of the grain boundary is characterized by the order parameter @xmath19 . in a ginzburg - landau model for the grain boundary ,",
    "the relevant contribution to the superconducting free energy per unit area of the grain boundary is @xmath20 for points @xmath8 on the positive @xmath8 axis , and @xmath21 for points on the negative @xmath8 axis ( _ e .",
    "g. _  see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . now consider a new state obtained by reflecting the sample of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) in a plane normal to the plane of the figure and containing the twin boundary . assuming that the ybco superconducting order parameter is of the @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 orthorhombic symmetry type ( _ e.g. _  see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the new order parameters are related to the old by @xmath24 and @xmath25 . since the total free energy is unchanged by such a reflection , @xmath26 in eqs .",
    "[ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] .",
    "the interpretation @xcite of josephson experiments @xcite on twinned crystals has shown that the superconducting state of ybco has odd symmetry with respect to a reflection in a twin boundary , _",
    "i.  e. _  that @xmath27 .",
    "the argument is as follows . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the superconducting order parameter can either be continous or change sign at a twin boundary ; for ybco these two cases correspond to the superconducting state having either even or odd symmetry with respect to a reflection in the twin boundary .",
    "now , josephson experiments on twinned crystals determine what is called the macroscopic symmetry of the superconducting state of the twinned crystal ( which is different from the microscopic symmetry of the superconducting state of a single twin ) .",
    "it can be shown that , if the twin boundaries have even reflection symmetry , the macroscopic symmetry of the superconducting state of the twinned crystal is that of a tetragonal s - wave superconductor . on the other hand ,",
    "if the twin boundaries have odd reflection symmetry , the macroscopic symmetry is that of a tetragonal d@xmath28 superconductor .",
    "since the josephson experiments on twinned crystals @xcite show macroscopic d@xmath28 symmetry , the superconducting twin boundaries must have odd reflection symmetry .",
    "further details of this argument can be found in @xcite .    a twin boundary at which the superconducting state has odd reflection symmetry ( i.e. for which @xmath29 ) can be viewed as a @xmath6 josephson junction ( a @xmath6 junction because of the change of sign of the order parameter there ) with a very high critical current density .",
    "because of the very high value of the critical current density ( which is much greater than the current densities occuring in the superconductor ) the phase difference of the order parameter across the junction is always locked to @xmath6 .",
    "now note that the point @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) can be viewed as the meeting point of three josephson junctions . because @xmath26 in eqs .",
    "[ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] the grain boundary josephson junctions along @xmath30 and @xmath31 are either both normal junctions or both @xmath6 junctions .",
    "also , as discussed above , since @xmath32 along the twin boundary , the twin boundary can be viewed as a @xmath6 junction .",
    "clearly , an odd number of @xmath6 junctions converge at the meeting point .",
    "thus , the stable superconducting ground state will contain a vortex with flux @xmath16 at the point @xmath15 in agreement with the arguments and experimental observations of @xcite and @xcite .    as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the designation of a josephson junction as a normal junction or a @xmath6 junction is a matter of convention ( the total number of @xmath6 junctions which meet at a point is however fixed ) . in the above ,",
    "the given transformation properties of the order parameter under a reflection in the twin boundary are what imposed the particular convention adopted .",
    "if the substitution @xmath33 is made , then the twin boundary will become a normal junction and the grain boundary junction for @xmath34 will become a @xmath6 junction . note that this substitution produces an extra minus sign in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] ; it is this additional minus sign that leads to @xmath35 for @xmath30 in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] , while @xmath36 for @xmath31 .",
    "it is also important to note that twin boundaries on the other side of the grain boundary , as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , are not expected to lead to variations of @xmath11 .",
    "as above , the superconducting free energy per unit area of the grain boundary above and below the point zero can be written @xmath37 and @xmath38 the assumption that the superconductivity of ybco is predominantly of the type @xmath4 implies that @xmath39 and @xmath40 have opposite signs .",
    "in addition , for the reasons stated above , @xmath41 .",
    "the combination of these two sign changes means that there will be no effect on the net contribution to @xmath11 when crossing a twin boundary of the type indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the arguments just given show that the superconducting grain boundary free energy can be written @xmath42 \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath43\\ , \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] @xmath44 is the critical current density , @xmath45 is the thickness of the superconducting film in the direction normal to the plane of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and @xmath46 is the speed of light . also , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the magnetic thickness of the grain boundary , @xmath49 being the london penetration depth . the quantity proportional to @xmath50 represents the magnetic and surface current energy in the grain boundary.@xcite    the free energy of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) has the form of a lagrangian describing the motion of a particle of mass @xmath51 in a potential @xmath52 ; here @xmath53 represents the particle displacement , and @xmath8 is time .",
    "thus , it is clear that the condition for @xmath54 to be a minimum is the equation of motion ( 1 ) , where the force on the particle is @xmath55 . since the particle velocity , @xmath56 , is proportional to the magnetic induction @xmath57 in the junction , _ i.  e. _",
    "@xmath58 it will be continuous across the twin boundaries where @xmath59 changes by @xmath6 ; also , since @xmath56 is continuous , @xmath60 will also be continuous .",
    "this interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) as describing the motion of a particle in a potential @xmath52 allow a simple intuitive description of the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "first consider the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] for @xmath61 , _ i.  e. _  no twin boundaries present .",
    "@xcite there will be a solution corresponding to a particle starting at the potential maximum ( point @xmath62 of fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) with zero velocity , accelerating down the hill to reach its maximum velocity at point @xmath63 , and then gradually decelerating as it climbs the hill to come to rest again at point @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding graph of displacement versus time ( or @xmath60 versus @xmath8 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the total change in @xmath60 of @xmath64 gives a flux associated with this vortex of @xmath13 ( recall @xmath65 ) . since the magnetic induction in the grain boundary is proportional to the particle velocity @xmath56 , it has its maximum value at the point @xmath15 of fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . for this example , the solution @xmath9 and the free energy can be evaluated analytically.@xcite the free energy of this vortex ( relative to the state with @xmath66 ) is positive , which means that the vortex is not stable in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "now consider the case of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) where the grain boundary is contacted by a single twin boundary at @xmath15 , and there are no other twin boundaries within a distance of many josephson penetration depths @xmath10 . here , @xmath61 for @xmath31 and @xmath67 for @xmath30 .",
    "the relevant potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , and the solution of interest corresponds to a particle starting at point @xmath62 with zero velocity , accelerating down the hill to point @xmath63 , decelerating up the hill from @xmath63 and coming to rest at @xmath46 . as noted above , the particle velocity is continuous at point @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding graph of @xmath60 as a function of @xmath8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "the change of @xmath60 by @xmath6 corresponds to the vortex containing a flux of @xmath16 .",
    "this vortex is confined to be centred on the twin boundary , since moving the vortex away from the twin boundary will increase its free energy by an amount which , at large distances , is proportional to the distance it is displaced .",
    "it is also clear that the state with no vortex ( _ i .",
    "@xmath68 ) is unstable with respect to the formation of the @xmath16 vortex state .",
    "a related problem is that in which there are an odd number of twin boundaries like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) which contact the grain boundary in a region @xmath69 , but where there are no changes of @xmath59 ( _ i .",
    "e. _  no twin boundaries ) for several josephson penetration depths for @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this case",
    "also , the state with no net flux in the region @xmath69 will be unstable with respect to the formation of a state with a flux of @xmath16 ( states with flux @xmath72 , @xmath73 an integer , are also possible ) .",
    "suppose the grain boundary contains only two twin boundaries of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , and that these are separated by a distance @xmath74 .",
    "the appropriate potential is shown in fig .",
    "again the particle begins at @xmath62 with zero velocity , accelerates downhill , passes the points @xmath63 and @xmath46 corresponding to the location of the two twin boundaries , and eventually comes to rest at @xmath5 . in passing point @xmath63 ,",
    "the phase @xmath59 jumps by @xmath6 ; because @xmath56 must be continuous at @xmath63 , the kinetic energy is continuous at @xmath63 ; the potential energy of the particle in the region from @xmath63 to @xmath46 is therefore taken to be @xmath75 $ ] where the constant @xmath76 is chosen so that the potential energy , and hence the total energy , will be conserved when the particle passes point @xmath63 . because of the time the particle spends in the region from @xmath63 to @xmath46 , its free energy is lowered relative to what it would be in the absence of twin boundaries by an amount which is approximately @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the vortex will be pinned by the region between the two twin boundaries .",
    "suppose the separation between twin boundaries is random and typically has a magnitude less than the josephson penetration depth @xmath10 .",
    "al._@xcite have discussed a stochastic approach to the estimation of the variations of @xmath9 in this case , and have shown how a flux of @xmath13 can be spread out over a large distance ( _ i .",
    "e. _ a distance of many times @xmath10 ) as is observed in their experiments .",
    "this spreading out of the flux can also be understood in terms of the dynamical picture discussed above .",
    "consider , for example , a particle beginning with zero velocity at @xmath62 in the potential of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and accelerating downhill to @xmath63 where it encounters a twin boundary ; the particle then climbs from @xmath63 to @xmath46 ; at @xmath46 the particle velocity goes to zero ( the potential energy at @xmath46 is the same as at @xmath62 ) and the particle then rolls back downhill past @xmath63 , @xmath46 and comes to @xmath78 , where another twin boundary is encountered , and then continues towards @xmath79 .",
    "it is seen that the particle can spend a lot of time rolling back and forward in the various potentials it encounters each time a twin boundary is crossed .",
    "this time is equivalent to distance measured along the twin boundary .",
    "this shows how a small amount of total flux can be spread out over a large distance .",
    "the fundamental process which is at the origin of spontaneous flux generation in asymmetric @xmath0 grain boundaries in the mechanism advanced in this paper is the stabilization of a vortex with flux @xmath16 at points where a twin boundary such as that shown in fig.[fig2](b ) intersects a grain boundary .",
    "the existence of such half integral vortices is a consequence of the fact that the superconducting state of ybco has odd symmetry with respect to a reflection in a twin boundary , and the observation of such vortices would thus constitute an experimental test of this odd reflection symmetry .",
    "furthermore , this conclusion is independent of whether the @xmath22 orthorhombic - symmetry order parameter of ybco is predominantly @xmath4 or s - wave .",
    "in contrast to the above , the point where the twin boundary of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) intersects the grain boundary should not support the existence of a vortex containing a flux of @xmath80 . in this case , the assumption that the ybco superconductivity is predominantly @xmath4-wave has been combined with the assumption that the twin boundaries have odd reflection symmetry to arrive at this conclusion .    the fundamental process which is at the origin of spontaneous flux generation in the mechanism of mannhart _ et.al._@xcite and moler _",
    "et.al._@xcite is the stabilization of a vortex with a flux of @xmath16 at the vertex @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] of the intersection of two distinct facets of a grain boundary .",
    "it is possible that both the faceting mechanism and the twin boundary mechanism play a role in grain boundaries studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    although the materials and sample preparation problems are no doubt formidable , it would be of interest to prepare samples having isolated twin boundaries , and an isolated intersection of two facets [ such as shown in figs  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2](a ) and ( b ) ] and to observe directly the presence or absence of vortices with a flux of @xmath16 in these idealized cases .",
    "the superconductor on the right hand side of figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2](a ) , and on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , does not necessarily have to be ybco , but could be an isotropic superconductor such as lead .",
    "an interesting special case of the faceting mechanism for the stablization of a @xmath16 vortex occurs in the corner junction such as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite . to obtain the @xmath16 vortex",
    ", the junction would have to be long in comparison with the josephson penetration depth .",
    "the actual experimental conditions of ref .",
    "@xcite correspond to the short junction case .",
    "note also that in c - axis tunneling from a twinned crystal of ybco to pb ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the josephson junctions formed by the two different types of twins must be , one a @xmath6 junction and the other a normal junction ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "thus , a necessary condition for spontaneous flux generation is satisfied here also .",
    "for example , for a ybco crystal which consists of only two twins , a vortex containing a half a flux quantum would form along the line where the plane containing the single twin boundary contacts the junction .",
    "the fact that the junctions@xcite are `` fabricated on a broad surface normal to the @xmath46 axis '' however means that the normal and @xmath6 junctions are distributed over a two - dimensional surface .",
    "this is different from the situation of refs . @xcite where the normal and @xmath6 junctions are distributed along a one - dimensional grain boundary .",
    "the degree of orthorhombicity of the superconductivity of ybco plays a role in the mechanisms just described . for example , for a tetragonal @xmath4  superconductor , the critical current for an ideal asymmetric @xmath0 twin boundary ( such as @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is zero , and the critical currents on the grain boundary facets @xmath82 and @xmath83 have opposite signs . for a superconductor which has some orthorhombicity but is nevertheless approximately @xmath84 , the critical current on @xmath81 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is not zero , and the angle @xmath85 ( or @xmath86 ) will have to exceed some nonzero critical value in order for the critical currents of the two facets to have opposite signs . similarly , some orthorhombicity is necessary for the critical current not to be zero on the grain boundaries of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "one measure of the degree of orthorhombicity of the superconductivity in ybco , is the ratio of the penetration depths , @xmath87 , measured along the crystallographic @xmath62 and @xmath63 directions , in untwinned single crystals.@xcite this ratio is approximately 1.5 to 2.0 in high quality crystals @xcite thus indicating a considerable degree of superconducting orthorhombicity .",
    "the result @xmath88 obtained in an earlier measurement @xcite has been attributed @xcite to the presence of disorder in the cuo chains . since the degree of orthorhombicity appears to depend on crystal quality , and since the orientation @xmath85 of the grain boundary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) at which the critical josephson current vanishes is also a measure of the orthorhombicity , the crystal quality is expected to play some role in the detailed understanding of spontaneous flux generation in asymmetric @xmath0 grain boundaries .",
