    "for all four methods a variable timestep yields errors that are 12 orders of magnitude smaller than a fixed timestep ( at the same number of function evaluations per unit time ) .",
    "the explicit multistep method performs much better than the implicit methods , in part because the implicit methods require 38 force evaluations per step to iterate to convergence .",
    "however , even if the convergence of the implicit multistep methods could be achieved in 23 iterations they would not perform significantly better than the explicit method on this test .",
    "a surprising result is that there is a range of the horizontal axis in which the multistep methods with variable timestep integrate eccentric orbits with smaller energy error than circular orbits .",
    "toomre ( 1990 , private communication ) and quinlan ( 1999 ) showed that multistep  for the special second - order differential equation ( [ eq : fff ] ) suffer instabilities at unlucky timesteps at which there is a resonance between the oscillation frequencies of the solution and the method .",

    "[ eq : gerry ] in practice these resonant instabilities are never a concern for our zero - growth multistep .",
    "this is because the timesteps ( [ eq : gerry ] ) lie outside the interval of periodicity for nearly circular keplerian orbits .",

    "this is the most susceptible to resonant instabilities of the zero - growth methods we have examined , both because it has the largest interval of periodicity and because , as @xmath260 , two of the spurious roots coalesce as @xmath261 .",

    "figure [ fig : final ] shows the locations of the potentially troublesome timesteps @xmath9 , together with the maximum possible timestep ( already presented in figure [ fig : periodkepler ] )",
    ". the resonant instabilities always occur at timesteps that are outside the interval of periodicity for keplerian orbits .",
    "similar results hold for the methods sz5 and sz6e .",
    "the generic instabilities of multistep  for first - order differential equations identified by cano & sanz - serna ( 1998 ) are a grave problem and render many of these methods unusable .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the elaboration of a class of multistep   the zero - growth methods  that successfully evade the instabilities .",
    "this select group includes two familiar second - order multisteps , namely the trapezoidal method ( [ eq : trap ] ) and the explicit midpoint method ( [ eq : mid ] ) , as well as entirely new multistep . in particular , we have identified three one - parameter families of zero - growth , fourth - order   namely , the five - step implicit method sz5 defined by equations ( [ eq : l5pm ] ) and ( [ eq : s5pm ] ) , the six - step implicit method sz6i defined by ( [ eq : l6ppm ] ) and ( [ eq : s6ppm ] ) , and the six - step explicit method sz6e defined by ( [ eq : l6mpm ] ) and ( [ eq : s6mpm ] ) . of these , the explicit method sz6e eliminates the need to iterate to convergence at each timestep without a major sacrifice in the interval of periodicity .",
    "the stability of the zero - growth methods has been understood at a theoretical level and confirmed at a practical level by integrations of circular and eccentric keplerian orbits .",
    "there are several advantages of multistep  for first - order differential equations over the multistep  for special second - order differential equations examined by lambert & watson ( 1976 ) , quinlan & tremaine ( 1990 ) , and fukushima ( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "they permit the introduction of variable timesteps without spoiling reversibility or long - term energy conservation .",
    "they are also more general , since any ordinary differential equations can always be reduced to a system of first - order equations ; thus , for example , the methods described here can be used to follow orbits in rotating frames of reference or the motions of rotating rigid bodies .",
    "a third advantage is that they are less susceptible to timestep resonances .",
    "the price paid for these attractive features is that ( i ) the interval of periodicity of the higher order methods such as sz5 , sz6i and sz6e is rather small , forcing the use of smaller timesteps than other methods ; ( ii ) more steps are needed for a method of given order ; there are no fourth - order methods with fewer than five steps and no fifth or sixth - order methods with 8 or fewer steps ( the limit of our explorations ) .",
    "nonetheless , the six - step explicit method ( sz6e ) remains a competitive option for problems in which it is critical to have variable timesteps and to avoid irreversible numerical errors : examples include long - term integrations of asteroid or comet orbits , or orbits near the centers of galaxies .      1 .",
    "are there zero - growth  with more than @xmath224 steps that have higher order or a larger interval of periodicity ?",
    "we have explored all @xmath263 but have found no  of order greater than 4 .",
    "gautschi ( 1961 ) developed a class of methods closely related to the linear multisteps .",
    "just as a linear multistep is defined by the requirement that the operator ( [ eq : linearoperator ] ) annihilate all algebraic polynomials of order @xmath264 , so the gautschi multisteps annihilate certain trigonometric polynomials up to a given degree .",
    "these methods are particularly appealing when the solution is known to be periodic and a reasonable estimate for the period of the orbit can be guessed in advance ",
    "requirements that are often satisfied in solar system integrations .",
    "can we find reversible gautschi multisteps ?",
    "integration methods are generally designed to maximize the order @xmath63 , defined so that the one - step error in following a system with characteristic frequency @xmath116 is proportional to @xmath265 .",
    "perhaps it is more sensible to `` economize '' the error , by minimizing the maximum value of the error over a range of frequencies @xmath266 . in this case",
    "the error would be nearly proportional to a chebyshev polynomial @xmath267 with argument @xmath268 and degree @xmath269 , instead of @xmath270 .",
