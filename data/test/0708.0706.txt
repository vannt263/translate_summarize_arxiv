    "recently , interests have been generated on cooling techniques for mechanical systems at nano- and micron - scales @xcite . among them ,",
    "the typically employed is the feedback cooling technique where an external feedback circuit is responsible for detecting the motion of the target and feeding a counteracting force against this motion ; through a general decrease of magnitude in the density noise spectrum , it was shown that the feedback can effectively reduce the fluctuation of the target and provide a cooling mechanism @xcite .",
    "some experiments based on the models that contain the feedback loops have been carried out in the past few years .",
    "a few are directed towards the cooling of micron- to nanometer - size mechanical resonators , aiming to reach a macroscopic quantum mechanical ground state and serving as a powerful manifestation of quantum mechanical effects @xcite .",
    "other experiments succeed in slowing down the motion of micron - size mirrors through the radiation pressure of an optical field in a fabry - prot ( fp ) cavity , aiming to reach a noise level and equivalently an effective temperature that are pertinent to the employment of high - precision detection of gravity waves @xcite .",
    "the forementioned implementations of feedback cooling through reduction of noise fluctuations invariably rely on an electrical circuitry external to the target system to be cooled .",
    "the controller here is usually fixed and attracts or repels the resonator through either electrostatic coulomb force or lorentzian force .",
    "if such an external detection - control unit could be eliminated in favor of a mechanism with self - detection of and self - adjustment to the target s thermal motion , we call the mechanism `` self - cooling '' @xcite . devices implementing this self - cooling use less components and are free from the reliance on an external circuitry and hence prone to less noise sources .    in one case @xcite , an augmented cavity along with an extra optical cavity field is established on the other side of the mirror , in addition to the regular fp cavity , so as to counteract the radiation pressure from the original cavity field .",
    "this extra field cushions the motion of the pressure mirror and plays the role of feedback . in another case",
    "@xcite , a set of josephson junctions behaving as a qubit , serially connected to a mechanical resonating beam , serves delayed supercurrent into the circuit according to the magnetic flux through the circuit loop .",
    "the magnetic flux is controlled by the vibrating motion of the beam , which in turn is controlled by the magnetic field generated by the current feed .",
    "such a mutual dependence furnishes a self - feedback mechanism .",
    "it should be pointed out that both of the self - feedback setups require delayed feedback , which assumed _ a priori _ a non - markovian approximation that explicitly depends on the history of the target s motion . in these phenomenological treatments , the cooling target either couples itself to a static controller and makes itself prone to the noise stemmed from the feedback , or couples to a mechanically static detection construct and receives manually delayed feedback .    hereby , we present a dynamic model based on an intrinsic mechanism with non - markovian feedback , which is obviously free from an external feedback loop and does not rely on a presupposition of historical dependence .",
    "this mechanism is illustrated by a simple mechanical system in which the target is modeled by a harmonic oscillator and attached to a dynamic controller , which is a relatively heavier resonator , through a spring .",
    "the target is controlled by an intrinsic feedback through the dynamics of coupling : earlier positions and velocities of the target affects the motion of the controller and this influence is subsequently fed back to the target .",
    "consequently , the accumulation of earlier states of the target will affect the state of itself later . with proper parameter setup",
    ", the target essentially experiences a resistance and decelerates its motion ; its displacement variance is shrunk , noise suppressed and effective temperature cooled down . the lack of a specific detection device for the motion of the target resonator and an external feedback circuit characterizes the intrinsic nature of the mechanical feedback .",
    "our numerical analysis shows the existence of a noise suppression capability of our scheme , e.g. the variance of displacement can be reduced to @xmath0 , and therefrom a cooling capability under a practical setting accessible in current experiments .",
    "we note that the scheme is theoretically illustrative through its simple model setup yet widely applicable because the general oscillator systems can be extended to quantum bosonic systems and other cases .",
    "in fact , a similar model and mechanism has been proposed to actively cool down the torsional vibration of a nanomechanical resonator through spin - orbit interactions @xcite .",
    "the model will be explained in sec.[sec : model ] and its delay function then derived _ a posteriori _ to examine its non - markovian dependence .",
    "the complete solution of the system dynamics is given in sec.[sec : exact_soln ] , with which we will derive the density noise spectrum and calculate the theoretical noise suppression rate .",

    "@xmath5 is the harmonic driving force.,width=288 ]",
    "our model setup ( see fig.[fig : model ] ) comprises two masses and three springs .",
    "the two masses are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the mass @xmath1 is the target and typically lighter whereas the mass @xmath3 serves as an ancillary controller and is relatively heavier .",
    "the three springs are denoted by their hooke s constants @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the spring of constant @xmath6 attaches the lighter mass @xmath1 to the fixed wall on the left and the spring of constant @xmath4 attaches the heavier mass @xmath3 to the fixed wall on the right .",
    "the spring of constant @xmath2 strings the two masses together .",
    "such a setup , intuitively , grants the heavier mass @xmath3 the function of a suspension system and a medium for the feedback .",
    "the symbol @xmath5 represents an external driving force which is necessary for the discussion of cooling but can be deemed zero for the present .",
    "the connected springs will give rise to mechanical vibrations of the masses .",
    "we let @xmath7 denote the effective mechanical resonance frequency for the mass @xmath1 , assuming the other mass @xmath3 is fixed , and @xmath8 the equivalent for the mass @xmath3 , assuming the mass @xmath1 is fixed .",
    "besides these mechanical vibrations , we assume each of the masses experience a frictional damping and we let @xmath9 denote the damping coefficient for the mass @xmath1 and @xmath10 that for mass @xmath3 .    then according to the setup above ,",
    "the coordinates of the two masses obey a coupled system of classical langevin equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coordinate of the mass @xmath1 and @xmath13 that of the mass @xmath3 . @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the right hand side of the equations denote the random thermal noise generated by the mass @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively , due to their frictional damping .",
    "the frictional damping terms as dissipation and the random noise terms as fluctuations constitute the total brownian thermal force in the classical langevin formalism .",
    "this thermal force induces an thermal environment , the effect of which is divided among the two terms @xmath16 and @xmath17 according to the fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite @xmath18 for now we assume the two masses are independently interacting with two thermal environments .",
    "that is , there are no correlations between the fluctuations of the two masses    actually , we can realize from eq.([eq : langevin_x ] ) and eq.([eq : fd - relation ] ) that the motion of the mass @xmath1 is resisted by a frictional force @xmath9 , which in turn is transduced into thermal energy and heats up itself .",
    "this process , however , is mediated by the mass @xmath3 that stands between @xmath1 and the fixed wall through the term @xmath19 .",
    "if there were not the mass @xmath3 , the kinetic oscillation of @xmath1 would be instantly reacted by the surrounding springs of hooke s constant @xmath6 and @xmath4 . with the presence of the mass @xmath3 and the extra spring of constant @xmath2",
    ", the oscillation of the mass @xmath1 will first squeeze the spring of constant @xmath2 , and then the squeezed spring will release and push the mass @xmath3 to the right .",
    "it follows that the spring of constant @xmath4 will be squeezed successively .",
    "the mediating mass @xmath3 breaks the original single spring into two and permits these two springs to stay in different states , squeezed and released , and hence essentially delays the reaction of the springs .",
    "this cascaded process is then reflected by the wall and executed in a reversed order to the left ; the delayed reaction of the springs of constant @xmath2 and @xmath4 acts back onto the oscillating mass @xmath1 .",
    "the delayed reaction depends on the oscillating velocity of the target mass @xmath1 and can thus be considered a feedback onto itself .",
    "the entire process can be regarded as a feedback loop from the view of control theory through the flow diagram shown in fig.[fig : feedback_flow ] .",
    "the target resonator @xmath1 is the system to be controlled and the ancillary resonator @xmath3 becomes the controller which detects the signal @xmath20 as its input and feeds the signal @xmath21 as its output .",
    "the cycle time of the loop corresponds to the delay of the controller - to - system reaction .",
    "the dependence of this delayed reaction on the tunable parameters , mainly those spring constants , allows us to control this self - feedback precisely to counteract the oscillating motion of the target mass",
    ".     receives signal @xmath20 and outputs signal @xmath21 according to the motion of the target @xmath1.,width=302 ]    the weakened motion is converted to a reduction of effective temperature of the target mass through an equivalent relation between the autocorrelation of the target s displacement and temperature , derived from the fluctuation - dissipation relation eq.([eq : fd - relation ] ) . under normal circumstances , that is , when the coupling mass @xmath3 were not present , this equivalent relation can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath9 is defined as in eq.([eq : langevin_x ] ) and @xmath23 is a function to be given explicitly .",
    "experimentally , the statistical variance of the coordinate is measured and the above relation is used to compute an effective temperature .    increasing the damping coefficient @xmath9 will certainly increase the enveloping rate of the oscillating motion of @xmath20 .",
    "however , this reduction of motion can not lead to an equivalent noise suppression effect upon the target mass @xmath1 because of the constraint imposed by the friction - induced fluctuation relation described above .",
    "in fact , according to this relation , increasing damping rate leads to more thermal dissipation of the system .",
    "that is to say , simply enlarging frictional force merely results in a heating effect upon the target system .",
    "our aim , therefore , is to reduce the temperature of the target mass by reducing its coordinate variance through the feedback that does not simultaneously increase the damping coefficient .",
    "after we derive the explicit feedback response below , we will show the feedback is actually shrinking the variance in sec.[sec : exact_soln ] .",
    "generally , a feedback external to an oscillating system has the effect of adding an extra driving force term on the right hand side of the equation of motion , i.e. @xmath24 where we have let @xmath25 denote the coordinate of a general dynamic system , @xmath26 the feedback force , and @xmath9 , @xmath27 , @xmath14 terms of similar meanings to those defined in eq.([eq : langevin_x ] ) .",
    "if the target were to be cooled , the motion of the system should be slowed down .",
    "in other words , behaving as a function of the target s velocity , the force @xmath26 should have an equivalent effect of increasing the damping coefficient , but do not increase the fluctuations .",
    "besides , the feedback force should be dependent on the target s position and the noise source .    summing up these requirements , we expect @xmath26 to be a function of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath14 . to overcome the generic fluctuation - dissipation relations and hence accomplish an efficient noise suppression , we shall use a non - markovian type feedback : @xmath26 not only depends on the current value of the velocity and the position of the target , but also their historical values at past times .",
    "if we represent the historical dependence by a time - derivative @xmath30 and weigh the contribution of the histories by a delay function @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for the current time and @xmath33 for the time in the past , the feedback force can be written as an integral with respect to @xmath33 , @xmath34    the above formula shows the mathematical character of a general feedback force .",
    "inversely , any function that can express the same character should be considered a feedback force .",
    "therefore , we can verify the dynamic response of the coupling mass @xmath3 in our model as an effective feedback mechanism by finding the corresponding specific expression for @xmath35 and @xmath31 .",
    "to do so , we solve eq.([eq : langevin_q ] ) by using fourier transforms and integration by parts ( the detailed derivation is given in appendix [ sec : derv_delay ] ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the inhomogeneous part of the equation , i.e. the external driving force to @xmath3 .",
    "in the solution , @xmath38\\left\\ { \\sqrt{4\\bar{\\omega}^{2}-\\gamma^{2}}\\times\\right.\\label{eq : delay}\\\\   &   & \\left.\\cos\\left[\\frac{\\xi}{2}\\sqrt{4\\bar{\\omega}^{2}-\\gamma^{2}}\\right]+\\gamma\\sin\\left[\\frac{\\xi}{2}\\sqrt{4\\bar{\\omega}^{2}-\\gamma^{2}}\\right]\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the delay function that we look for and @xmath39 correspondingly shows the historical dependence .",
    "if we plug the solution ( [ eq : soln_q ] ) into eq.([eq : langevin_x ] ) , i.e. reduce the degree of freedom of the variable @xmath21 in the equation by substituting with its formal solution , we arrive at an integro - differential equation of only a single variable @xmath20 , which is comparable to the feedback - containing equation of motion that appears in previous literature @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter case the delay function is assume to be a non - markovian approximation @xmath40 and @xmath41 is left unknown . here",
    ", we have explicitly implemented a self - feedback mechanism that exerts force back onto the mass @xmath1 after certain delay through the use of the coupling mass @xmath3 . the sinusoidal factor in the delay eq.([eq : delay ] ) illustrates the damped oscillating motion of the mass @xmath3 .",
    "the implicit time derivative of @xmath20 within the integrand implies up to an equivalent effect an additional friction to the motion of the mass @xmath1 , which damps the oscillation without increasing the target s fluctuation .",
    "the non - integral term is markovian and has the same order as @xmath42 . though it does not appear in eq.([eq : feedback_form ] ) , this term effectively reduces the oscillating frequency and shall not counteract the feedback effect .",
    "therefore , both terms impose noise suppression effect to our target .",
    "the only limitation , however , is the thermal fluctuation @xmath17 from the coupling mass @xmath3 itself and it will result in a limit for the suppression because of the competition between this fluctuation and the effective feedback .",
    "in order to examine the validity of the above proposed mechanism and verify the efficacy of the cooling rate , we find the analytic solutions of the langevin equations ( [ eq : langevin_x ] ) and ( [ eq : langevin_q ] ) to reflect the displacement of the target @xmath1 as a response to its own thermal noise , the motion of the ancillary mass @xmath3 and the thermal noise of mass @xmath3 . from the response function",
    ", we shall derive the effective damping coefficient and vibrating frequency of the target mass @xmath1 as well as the autocorrelation function of its coordinate . the noise spectrum and the total noise fluctuation",
    "are then defined upon these derived quantities .",
    "the displacement spectrum can be written as the sum of responses of the noise terms ( the derivation is given in appendix [ sec : derv_soln ] ) @xmath43 note that the two different susceptibilities @xmath44 and @xmath45\\left[\\bar{\\omega}_{e}^{2}-\\omega^{2}+i\\omega\\gamma_{e}\\right]}\\label{eq : response_f}\\ ] ] reflect the system s different responses to thermal fluctuations from the mass @xmath1 and the mass @xmath3 . here , we have defined the effective vibrating frequency of the mass @xmath1 to be @xmath46 and the effective damping coefficient of the mass @xmath1 to be @xmath47 eq.([eq : fourier_x ] ) means that the mechanical susceptibility or response function of the target @xmath1 is adjusted because of the dynamic coupling of the target mass @xmath1 to the ancillary mass @xmath3 .",
    "the first term represents the direct effect of the thermal bath acting on the target mass @xmath1 ; whereas the second term represents the indirect effect of the thermal bath onto the mass @xmath1 through the mediating mass @xmath3 and the coupling between the two masses .",
    "the positivity of the second term in eq.([eq : damp_eff ] ) has asserted our expectation of increasing the damping rate without increasing thermal force .",
    "we shall also note that an additional noise source @xmath48 is imposed onto the adjusted susceptibility eq.([eq : response ] ) due to the dynamic coupling . but seeing that it is divided by a frequency - squared term , we expect it to be negligible when the target mass @xmath1 is not resonating at a frequency close to that of the mass @xmath3 .",
    "the density noise spectrum ( dns ) , which is defined by the equation@xmath49 can thus be computed from eq.([eq : fourier_x ] ) @xmath50 comparing the above equation with the case when @xmath3 is absent , i.e. when @xmath51 is degenerated to @xmath9 , we observe a general suppression at the noise peak and spreading of the noise spectrum .",
    "the observable effect of the noise sources on the motion of the mass @xmath1 is equivalent to the variance of the displacement of the mass @xmath1 in time domain , which is defined as the average of the entire noise spectrum , i.e. the integral of the dns of @xmath12 , @xmath52 the integral is computable after we approximate the effective damping rate and vibrating frequency by truncating their expansions shown in appendix [ sec : derv_var ] . as a result ,",
    "the variance is a variable of temperature and the spring constants @xmath53    the noise fluctuation depends on the three spring constants @xmath6 , @xmath4 and @xmath2 as its parameters , and is independent of the masses @xmath1 and @xmath3 and the damping rate @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the resonators . we shall notice that the noise suppression effect for the target resonator is always present for all values the spring constant @xmath2 takes .",
    "this ideal result is due to the non - markovian feedback we derived in sec.[sec : model ] , which always increases the effective damping while retaining the same fluctuations .",
    "eq.([eq : supp_noise ] ) shows a complex relation between itself and its three parameters of spring constants . to illustrate its behavior ,",
    "we focus on its relation with the spring constant @xmath2 .",
    "it is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath2 and its two limiting values are @xmath54 which coincides with our expectation that enlarging the constant @xmath2 will render the feedback more effective due to the enlarged feedback amplitude eq.([eq : phi(x , t ) ] ) .",
    "the symmetry between the target mass and the ancillary mass in the model setup allows us to compute the variance of the ancillary mass following the same methodology @xmath55 the limiting value of @xmath56 at @xmath57 is identical to that of @xmath58 , which shows that under the extremal case where the two oscillating masses combines into one by a rigid body the limiting behaviors of the two bodies become the same .",
    "to show completely the noise suppression behavior of the two oscillating masses , the numerical analysis is separated into two parts with each part for each extremal end of the values of the spring constants whereas the other parameters are set to laboratory accessible values for common micromechanical resonators .",
    "the first case , the identical case , is where the springs attaching the two masses to the walls share the same hooke s constant , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "we examine how the noise suppression behavior is affected by varying the value of the constant @xmath2 of the middle spring .",
    "the second case , the large detuning case , occurs when the springs attaching the two masses to the walls take vastly different values of their hooke s constant .",
    "again we examine the noise suppression limit for different values taken for the constant @xmath2 of the middle spring .",
    "we assume the springs with one end fixed to walls have @xmath60 .",
    "the lighter target mass has @xmath61 and its frictional damping rate @xmath62 .",
    "the heavier ancillary mass has @xmath63 and its frictional damping rate @xmath64 .",

    "the low frequency group , the rescaled along peak center plot shown on the left of fig.[fig : dns_of_x_case1 ] , shares exactly the same peaking frequencies as those of the ancillary mass and we expect this behavior takes place when the target mass is resonating with the ancillary mass .",

    ", this harmonic force appears as an extra term in the equation of motion of the ancillary resonator @xmath3 .    following the above arguments , we rewrite the coupled system of classical langevin equations eq.([eq : langevin_x ] ) and eq.([eq : langevin_q ] ) as@xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote , respectively , the momenta of the target resonator and the ancillary resonator .",

    "eq.([eq : dns_mo ] ) is also not analytically integrable , numerical integration shows the integral takes value similar to the case when the spring constant @xmath116 .",
    "that means the feedback is only effective in the displacement domain but not in the momentum domain .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a theoretical model to demonstrate the general self - feedback type noise suppression technique through the coupling between the target resonator and an adjuvant system . in particular ,",
    "such a self - feedback is achieved through the dynamics of the adjuvant system .",
    "the explicit delay function has been given and its efficacy in reducing the noise spectrum verified .",
    "we have also used numeral results to confirm our observations .    before concluding this paper , we add some remarks as follows :    first , the theory of thermal equilibrium state can be used to explain why the system comprising two resonating masses has its noise reduced to a limit when the spring constant @xmath2 tends from zero to infinity .",
    "if @xmath2 were zero , the stringing spring between the two masses would disappear and the system would comprise two independent resonators , each of which will attain its thermal equilibrium over time . in this case",
    ", the system has two degrees of freedom . according to the energy equipartition theorem",
    ", the system must contain twice as much energy as @xmath117 .",
    "for the other limit , when @xmath2 tends to infinity , the two resonators become a rigid body and possess only one degree of freedom , which means the system would contain only @xmath117 of energy .",
    "this explicit picture clarifies how the combined system reduces its energy over the increasing value of @xmath2 .",
    "however , how each resonator in the combined system reduces its own energy is an open question though we can intuitively think the heat bath may play crucial role in the asymmetric thermalization of the two resonators as tow open system .",
    "another remark is that the energy equipartition theorem is applicable only after the system enters thermal equilibrium state . when interaction occurs between the two degrees of freedom contributed by the two masses ,",
    "such an illustration is not appropriate .",
    "this is the reason why the nonlinear character of the noise suppression rate can not be explained by the energy equipartition theorem alone .",
    "in addition , we have assumed there does not exist correlation between the two noise sources for the two masses , i.e. @xmath118 .",
    "however , when the two masses oscillate very closely with each other , the above assumption based on independent thermal environments will not hold and we need to consider the case where @xmath119    another setting we shall consider is when the motions of the two masses are quantized : we need to change the fluctuation - dissipation relations eq.([eq : fd - relation ] ) and eq.([eq : fd - relation_f ] ) to @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are not simply @xmath123-functions and depends on the planck constant @xmath124 .",
    "we will present the general investigation on the case with quantum fluctuations and thermal bath correlations , but here we have concentrated on the simple case .",
