    "for source extraction and photometry , we used the sextractor tool ( bertin & arnouts 1996 , version 2.5 ) .",
    "this tool is able to identify sources via a tree structure algorithm , provide their total magnitudes , and , if a saddle point is present in their profile , to deblend components via a multi - isophotal analysis .",

    "close neighbours are found , the components are iteratively deblended , with the photometric uncertainty of the faint companion reaching 25% in the worst cases ( beard et al .",
    "1991 ) .    in a first step we adjusted the sextractor parameters for each image ( single - image mode ) .",
    "the parameters are , for instance , noise threshold and minimum number of connected pixels defining a source .",

    "@xmath1 m and 17 at 8.0  @xmath1 m .",
    "typical kron radii of the sources ( containing 90% of the flux ) are about 34 arcsec in all filters ( except 24  @xmath1 m ) , so that the psf differences play a minor role ( @xmath74 ) , and the @xmath2- and @xmath3-band photometry  as computed by sextractor  needs no aperture correction .- band photometry was calibrated with the z - band image of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , dr6 ) , including a ( very small ) color term to account for the similar but nonetheless different bandpasses .",
    "our @xmath3-band photometry was calibrated with interpolated total magnitudes from sdss and 2mass . ] for the irac photometry , however , the absolute photometric calibration refers to an aperture of 12 , so we applied standard aperture corrections ( 530% ) to derive the final photometry of the sources , all of which are essentially unresolved .",
    "the very few sources detected at 24  @xmath1 m are well separated , so that clean photometry could be derived without need for aperture correction .    in a second step ,",
    "we ran sextractor in double - image mode on the 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  irac maps , using as primary the 3.6 @xmath1 m map because it contains more sources than any other irac map .",
    "the double - image mode mode is able to identify , for instance , for a 3.6  @xmath1 m detection also the corresponding 4.5  @xmath1 m source , even if it was not detected in single - image mode .",
    "the double - image mode enabled us to detect essentially all 3.6 @xmath1 m sources at 4.5  @xmath1 m ( 272 of 274 sources ) .",
    "the detection rate at 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m was lower ( 202 and 212 sources , respectively ) .",
    "we determined the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath1 m upper flux limits ( @xmath757@xmath1jy ) from the break of the flux histograms of the detections . in case of non - detections and clean regions we used this flux value as the 3@xmath6 upper limit .",
    "sextractor was run separately on the @xmath2 image , and the @xmath2 and irac source lists were matched with a search radius of 1.5 .",
    "this should produce good identifications because no two irac sources are closer together than 3 . to check further",
    "how far confusion plays a role , we counted the number of mmt sources within a radius of 3  around each irac source . by far most sources ( @xmath1290% )",
    "are unambiguously matched to a single @xmath2 source .",
    "of 274 irac sources in the quasar field , 18 ( 6.6% ) have two @xmath2 counterpart , and one even has three .",
    "the control fields show about the same statistics : 9 double @xmath2 counterparts ( 4.4% ) out of 205 irac sources in the 3.6  field and 10 double counterparts ( 6.0% ) out of 167 irac sources in the 4.5  field .",
    "thus , the fraction of confused sources is small and comparable for control and quasar fields , and therefore we do not expect that the clustering results are significantly affected by confusion . to avoid any possible complication , we have omitted from the analysis all sources ( 47% ) with two or more @xmath2 counterparts found by sextractor .",
    "the starburst cluster candidate galaxy ( object number 3 in table  [ table_1 ] ) remained in the sample because sextractor treated it as a single source .",
    "most likely the saddle between the two components is not deep enough for sextractor to split them despite the source s visual appearance on the @xmath2 image as a 08 double .",
    "the quasar field has photometry in six filters , two mmt and four irac bands .",
    "but the two control fields have photometry in only three filters , in @xmath2 and two irac bands : 3.6 and 5.8  @xmath1 m in control field 1 , 4.5 and 8.0  @xmath1 m in control field  2 .",
    "this makes the uncertainties on the photometric redshifts larger , and therefore comparison within the same redshift bin appears not to be straightforward .",
    "furthermore , in the central field , the source detection rate at 4.5  @xmath1 m is lower than at 3.6  @xmath1 m , so that for a fair comparison the number of candidates in control field  2 has to be corrected for . in order to facilitate the comparison",
    ", we used the colors @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] and counted the number of candidates in the respective color bins .",
    "control field 1 : the colors of the elliptical and starburst template , when redshifted to @xmath0 , are @xmath77 = 25 and 39 , respectively . in the color range",
    "@xmath52 we found 28 and 17 sources for the quasar and the control field , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cm ] ) . with regard to the low number statistics , these values are consistent with the 29 and 16 sources in the quasar and the control field , having @xmath40 ( denoted as sed candidates in fig .",

    "this leaves an excess of 11 colour and 13 sed  selected sources in the quasar field .",
    "control field 2 : the colors of the elliptical and starburst template , redshifted to @xmath0 , are @xmath78 = 24 and 43 , respectively .",
    "guided by these `` expectation values '' and the actual @xmath76 $ ] distribution of the candidates in the quasar field , we selected a color range of @xmath79 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cm_2 ] , top ) .",
    "now we considered the fields , where the 4.5  @xmath1 m source list was created using the single - mode sextractor option , i.e. , not making use of the 3.6  @xmath1 m information in the quasar field .",
    "we found 24 and 14 color - selected candidates for the quasar and the control field , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cm_2 ] , middle and bottom ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the corresponding numbers for sed - selected candidates of 23 and 12 in the quasar and the control field , respectively . because the quasar field contains more cluster galaxy candidates , 29 via color and 29 via @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cm_2 ] , top ) , we have scaled up the number of candidates in the control field by the factors 29/24 for the color - candidates and",
    "29/23 for the sed - candidates .",
