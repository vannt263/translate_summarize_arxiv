    "recently it has become clear that type i - heterotic duality @xcite can be extended to @xmath3 cases in four dimensions @xcite . in particular , two cases with @xmath0-branes",
    "( but no @xmath5-branes ) have been worked out in detail .",
    "thus , ref @xcite studied type i - heterotic duality matching for the @xmath8-orbifold model of ref @xcite .",
    "there it was realized that although naively there is a discrepancy between the type i and heterotic spectra at the orbifold points , it disappears once orbifold singularities are blown - up and ( anomalous ) gauge symmetries are broken .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is the following .",
    "if the type i orbifold model contains only @xmath0-branes , then the open string sector gives rise to charged matter fields identical to those in the untwisted sector of the corresponding heterotic dual .",
    "the heterotic untwisted sector also contains gauge singlets which are geometric moduli .",
    "these are found in the untwisted closed string sector of the type i model .",
    "since heterotic strings are closed strings , the heterotic orbifold model also contains twisted sectors .",
    "these give rise to certain singlets charged under @xmath1 factors in the gauge group , but neutral under the non - abelian symmetries .",
    "their duals are found in the twisted closed string sectors of the type i model .",
    "the heterotic twisted sectors also contain matter fields charged under the non - abelian gauge groups .",
    "these have no type i counterparts .",
    "this is precisely the descrepancy between the type i and heterotic spectra mentioned above .",
    "the descrepancy is resolved by the fact that in the heterotic string model , there always is a _ perturbative _ superpotential such that after appropriate higgsing the extra twisted matter fields ( charged under non - abelian gauge groups ) become heavy and decouple from the massless spectrum .",
    "this higgsing always involves blowing - up orbifold singularities , and can sometimes also involve breaking of ( anomalous ) gauge symmetries .",
    "thus , in the @xmath8-orbifold case @xcite studied in ref @xcite the relevent terms in the superpotential are _ renormalizable _ yukawa couplings of the form @xmath9 ( this is only a symbolic way of writing these couplings as certain indices are suppressed ) , where @xmath10 are the orbifold blow - up modes , whereas @xmath11 are the extra twisted matter fields . in ref @xcite we worked out another chiral @xmath3 type i model on @xmath12 orbifold .",
    "there the couplings responsible for making the extra twisted matter fields heavy were _ non - renormalizable _ couplings of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 stands for untwisted matter fields acquiring vevs in order to break anomalous @xmath1 gauge symmetry present in that model .    in this paper",
    "we give a prescription ( following from tadpole cancellation conditions given in appendix [ tadpoles ] ) for contructing type i models with only @xmath0-branes on general abelian orbifolds ( the latter have odd order or else @xmath5-branes would be present ) . constructing their heterotic duals",
    "is not difficult . for",
    "a given type i model on @xmath15 symmetric abelain orbifold ( of odd order ) , one works out the chan - paton matrices @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) according to the prescription given in appendix [ tadpoles ] . then the heterotic dual",
    "is constructed by compactifying the @xmath18 heterotic string on @xmath15 with gauge connection ( shift ) in each twisted sector ( labeled by ) @xmath19 given by @xmath16 .",
    "the duality matching always goes as described above . to illustrate the rules and duality matching , we consider type i compactification on @xmath2 orbifold ( which is not a @xmath20 orbifold ) .",
    "we also generalize the rules of appendix [ tadpoles ] to a certain class of orbifolds with both @xmath0- and @xmath5-branes ( the orbifold has even order in this case ) . to illusterate the rules we construct a type i compactification on @xmath6 orbifold .",
    "the model has @xmath3 supersymmetry , @xmath21 gauge group coming from the 99 strings , @xmath21 gauge group coming from the 55 strings , and chiral matter coming from all three open string sectors ( 99 , 55 and 59 ) .",
    "this model has anomalous @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "in section vi we construct type i compactification on @xmath6 orbifold . in section",
    "vii we give conclusions and remarks .",
    "appendix [ tadpoles ] contains the rules for constructing type i compactifications with only @xmath0-branes on general abelian orbifolds ( of odd order ) .",
    "appendix [ d5tadpoles ] generalizes these rules to certain type i orbifolds ( of even order ) with both @xmath0- and @xmath5-branes .",
    "in this section we discuss the construction of the type i model on @xmath22 orbifold .",
    "let us start from the type iib string model compactified on the six - torus @xmath23 , where each of the two - tori @xmath24 has a @xmath25 rotational symmetry .",
    "this model has @xmath26 supersymmetry .",
    "let us now consider the symmetric @xmath22 orbifold model generated by the twists @xmath27 here @xmath28 is a @xmath29 rotation of a complex boson ( we have complexified the six real bosons into three complex bosons ) .",
    "the double vertical line separates the right- and left - movers of the string .",
    "the resulting model has @xmath30 space - time supersymmetry .",
    "this model has the following moduli .",
    "there are 8 ns - ns fields @xmath31 , and 8 r - r fields @xmath32 .",
    "let us now consider the orientifold projection of this model .",
    "the closed string sector ( which is simply the subspace of the hilbert space of the original type iib spectrum invariant under the orientifold projection @xmath33 ) contains the @xmath3 supergravity multiplet , and 3 untwisted ( the ns - ns fields that survive the @xmath33 projection are @xmath34 , whereas the r - r fields that are kept are @xmath35 ; note that the ns - ns field @xmath36 and the r - r field @xmath37 also survive and , enter in the dilaton supermultiplet ) and 81 twisted chiral supermultiplets ( which are neutral under the gauge group of the model ) . for consistency ( _ i.e. _ , tadpole cancellation ; see appendix [ tadpoles ] for details ) , we must include the open string sector .",
    "note that in this model we only have @xmath0-branes but no @xmath5-branes since the orbifold group does not contain an order two element .",
    "thus , we only have @xmath38 open strings .",
    "the gauge group consistent with tadpole cancellation then is @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath38 open strings also give rise to the following chiral matter fields : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , there are fields that can be obtained by permuting the three @xmath43 s ( this permutation must be accompanied by changing the irrep of the second and the third @xmath43 to its complex conjugate ) . here",
    "the first four entries in bold font indicate the irreps of the @xmath44 subgroup , whereas the @xmath45 charges are given in the parenthesis .",
    "the subscript @xmath46 indicates the space - time helicity of the corresponding fermionic fields .",
    "the massless spectrum of this model is summarized in table i.    note that the @xmath45 gauge symmetry is anomalous .",
    "we can form a linear combination of these @xmath1 s such that only one of them is anomalous ( this combination is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 are the first , second and third @xmath1 charges , respectively ) .",
    "the total @xmath1 anomaly is @xmath49 . by the generalized green - schwarz mechanism @xcite some of the fields charged under @xmath1",
    "will acquire vevs to cancel the fayet - illiopoulos @xmath50-term .",
    "in this section we give the construction of the heterotic string model that is ( candidate ) dual to the type i model considered in the previous section .",
    "let us start from the narain model with @xmath51 space - time supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "let the momenta of the internal ( 6 right - moving and 22 left - moving ) world - sheet bosons span the ( even self - dual ) narain lattice @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 is the @xmath18 lattice , whereas the lattice @xmath54 ( that corresponds to a two - torus @xmath24 ) is spanned by the momenta @xmath55 with @xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are integers , @xmath59 is the constant background metric , and @xmath60 .",
    "note that we could have included the constant anti - symmetric background tensor field @xmath61 , but for now we will set it equal to zero .",
    "this narain model has the gauge group @xmath62 .",
    "the first factor @xmath63 comes from the @xmath53 lattice ( the @xmath64 roots of length squared 2 ) , and 16 oscillator excitations of the corresponding world - sheet bosons ( the latter being in the cartan subalgebra of @xmath63 ) .",
    "the factor @xmath65 comes from the oscillator excitations of the six left - moving world - sheet bosons corresponding to @xmath66 .",
    "note that there are also six additional vector bosons coming from the oscillator excitations of the right - moving world - sheet bosons corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "these vector bosons are part of the @xmath51 supergravity multiplet .",
    "next consider the @xmath22 orbifold model ( with non - standard embedding of the gauge connection ) obtained via twisting the above narain model by the following @xmath25 twists : @xmath68 here @xmath28 is a @xmath29 rotation of a complex boson ( we have complexified the original six real bosons into three complex ones ) .",
    "thus , the first three entries correspond to the @xmath25 twists of the three right - moving complex bosons ( coming from the six - torus ) .",
    "the double vertical line separates the right- and left - movers .",
    "the first three left - moving entries correspond to the @xmath25 twists of the three left - moving complex bosons ( coming from the six - torus ) .",
    "the single vertical line separates the latter from the sixteen real bosons corresponding to the @xmath53 lattice .",
    "the latter are written in the @xmath63 basis .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath69 is a root of @xmath63 with length squared two .",
    "there are @xmath64 roots like this in the @xmath53 lattice , and they are descendents of the identity irrep of @xmath63 .",
    "the lattice @xmath53 also contains one of the spinor irreps as well .",
    "thus , we will choose this spinor irrep to contain the momentum states of the form @xmath70 with even number of plus signs .",
    "now we are ready to discuss the orbifold model generated by the twists @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this model has @xmath3 space - time supersymmetry , and gauge group @xmath39 , the same as the type i model discussed in the previous section .",
    "the untwisted sector gives rise to the @xmath3 supergravity multiplet coupled to the @xmath3 yang - mills gauge multiplet in the adjoint of @xmath39 .",
    "the matter fields in the untwisted sector are the same as those in the open string sector of the type i model .",
    "there are also chiral multiplets neutral under the gauge group : @xmath73 .",
    "note that these contain 6 scalar fields that are the left - over geometric moduli whose vevs parametrize the moduli space @xmath74 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "( this is the subspace of the original narain moduli space @xmath75 that is invariant under the twist . ) actually , the ( perturbative ) moduli space of this model is larger , and we will return to this point later on .",
    "next , consider the twisted sector .",
    "since both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are of order @xmath76 , their respective contributions to the one - loop partition function can have a non - trivial relative @xmath25 phase between them which we denote as @xmath77 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath78 ) .",
    "the states that survive the @xmath71 projection in the @xmath72 sector have @xmath71 phase @xmath77 , and the states that survive the @xmath71 projection in the inverse twisted sector @xmath79 have @xmath71 phase @xmath80 .",
    "string consistency requires that the states that survive the @xmath72 projection in the @xmath71 sector must have @xmath72 phase @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , the states that survive the @xmath72 projection in the inverse twisted sector @xmath81 must have @xmath72 phase @xmath77 .",
    "the twisted sector field content depends on the relative phase @xmath77 and so it gives rise to three different heterotic string models .",
    "it turns out that the model with @xmath82 is dual to the type i model described in the previous section . here , we list out the twisted sector field content of this model .",
    "we have the following chiral supermultiplets : @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 together with fields obtained by permuting the three @xmath43 s ( this permutation must be accompanied by changing the irrep of the second and the third @xmath43 to its complex conjugate ) .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath86 and @xmath87 coming from @xmath88 sector ( and its conjugate ) . here",
    "we note that the factors `` 9 '' and `` 27 '' come from the number of fixed points in different sectors of the @xmath89 orbifold we are considering .",
    "the @xmath90 singlets and the @xmath90 @xmath91 of @xmath92 are all projected out in the other two models ( @xmath93 ) , and hence their spectra do not match with the type i model .",
    "we summarize the massless spectrum of the heterotic string model which is the candidate dual of the type i model in table ii .",
    "note that the @xmath45 gauge symmetry is anomalous .",
    "again , only one linear combination of the three @xmath1 s is anomalous .",
    "thus , the contributions of the untwisted and twisted sectors into the trace anomaly are @xmath49 and @xmath94 , respectively , so that the total trace anomaly is @xmath95 . by the generalized green - schwarz mechanism",
    "@xcite some of the fields charged under @xmath1 will acquire vevs to cancel the fayet - illiopoulos @xmath50-term .",
    "in this section we discuss the perturbative superpotentials for the type i and heterotic string models discussed in the previous sections .",
    "studying the couplings and flat directions in these superpotentials will enable us to make the type i - heterotic duality map more precise .",
    "let us start from the type i model of section ii .",
    "we refer the reader to table i for the massless spectum as well as our notation .",
    "note that perturbatively the 81 chiral singlets coming from the closed string sector are flat .",
    "this can be explicitly seen by computing the scattering amplitudes for these modes within the framework of the conformal field theory of orbifolds @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the matter fields coming from the @xmath38 open string sector have three ( and , of course , some higher ) point couplings .",
    "the lowest order superpotential can be written as ( the calculation of the type i superpotential is completely analogous to that of the heterotic one in the untwisted sector ) @xmath96 due to the presence of the anomalous @xmath1 , some of the fields that are charged under this @xmath1 must acquire vevs to cancel the fayet - illiopoulos @xmath50-term .",
    "this results in breakdown of gauge symmetry , yet the space - time supersymmetry is preserved .",
    "now let us turn to the heterotic string model .",
    "the superpotential of this model is more involved than that of the type i model as there are non - trivial couplings between the twisted sector fields .",
    "the superpotential for the heterotic string model thus reads ( here we are only interested in the general structure of the _ non - vanishing",
    "_ terms ) : @xmath97 ( the notation for the fields is given in table ii . ) the couplings @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are non - vanishing if the orbifold _ space group _ selection rules are satisifed .",
    "these rules read as follows .",
    "@xmath102 if and only if @xmath103 or @xmath104 , and similarly for the @xmath105- and @xmath106-indices .",
    "@xmath107 if and only if @xmath103 or @xmath104 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the selection rules for the @xmath100 and @xmath101 couplings are similar to those for the @xmath99 couplings . here",
    "we note that , say , couplings @xmath110 with @xmath104 , and similarly for the @xmath105- and @xmath106-indices , are exponentially suppressed in the limit of large volume compactification , whereas the couplings with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are not suppressed .",
    "this is because in the former case , the corresponding fields are coming from different fixed points so that upon taking them apart ( in the limit of large volume of the orbifold ) their coupling becomes weaker and weaker .",
    "similar statements hold for the @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 couplings as well .",
    "notice that upon the singlets @xmath114 ( which are 27 blow - up modes ) acquiring vevs , the states @xmath115 and @xmath116 become heavy and decouple from the massless spectrum .",
    "thus , after blowing up the orbifold singularities on the heterotic side ( combined with some of the untwisted charged matter fields acquiring vevs to cancel the @xmath50-term ) , we can match the massless spectrum to that of the type i model ( where the charged matter must acquire vevs to cancel the effect of the anomalous @xmath1 ) .",
    "note the crucial role of the perturbative superpotential in this matching .",
    "it is precisely such that all the extra fields on the heterotic side can be made massive by blowing up the orbifold .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the moduli spaces for the type i and heterotic models considered in the previous sections .",
    "let us start with the heterotic model .",
    "the ( perturbative ) moduli space of the corresponding narain model before orbifolding is @xmath117 .",
    "after orbifolding we have two types of moduli : those coming from the untwisted sector , and those coming from the twisted sector .",
    "the untwisted sector moduli parametrize the coset @xmath118 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "the subspace @xmath119 ^ 3 $ ] of this moduli space is parametrized by @xmath120 neutral singlets @xmath121 that correspond to the left - over geometric moduli ( coming from the constant metric @xmath122 and antisymmetric tensor @xmath61 fields ) .",
    "the other @xmath123 moduli correspond to the flat directions in the superpotential for the fields @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "( these are the left - over moduli coming from the @xmath127 wilson lines @xmath128 , @xmath129 , in the original narain model . )",
    "next , we turn to the twisted moduli of the heterotic string model . in the twisted sectors , we have the chiral superfields @xmath130 , @xmath116 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . at a generic point",
    "( upon giving appropriate vevs to the @xmath114 fields ) , the fields @xmath116 and @xmath115 become massive ( according to the couplings in the superpotential ) and there is no superpotential for the singlets @xmath130 and @xmath114 ( the blow - up modes of the @xmath22 orbifold ) . the singlets @xmath130 are not charged under the anomalous @xmath1 .",
    "hence , all of them survive the higgsing process and they match with the corresponding singlets in the type i spectrum .",
    "however , the fields @xmath131 are charged under the anomalous @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , a linear combination of them will be eaten in the super - higgs mechanism .",
    "so , naively , not all the @xmath90 chiral fields survive after higgsing .",
    "this would pose a problem for matching of the type i and heterotic models .",
    "note , however , that the type i model has anomalous @xmath1 , and to cancel the @xmath50-term one needs to give vevs to the corresponding charged fields .",
    "so , generically , the fields @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 will acquire vevs ( on the type i side ) to break the anomalous @xmath1 .",
    "thus , to match the type i and heterotic models we have to give vevs to the @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 fields on the heterotic side as well .",
    "then , we will have @xmath90 neutral chiral superfields ( which , after higgsing , are a mixture of the original fields @xmath131 and the untwisted matter fields ) on the heterotic side , which do correspond to the @xmath90 neutral chiral superfields coming from the twisted closed string sector of the type i model . thus",
    ", the matching is complete after giving appropriate vevs to _ both _ twisted _ and _ untwisted fields on the heterotic side , as well as giving appropriate vevs to open string sector matter fields , and @xmath90 twisted closed string moduli . upon breaking the anomalous @xmath1 , the dilaton may mix with other gauge singlets @xcite . _ a priori _",
    ", the mixing is different on the type i and the heterotic side . to make the matching precise",
    ", one generically has to appropriately tune the dilaton plus @xmath121 geometric moduli on both sides .",
    "thus , the moduli spaces ( at generic points ) of both type i and heterotic models are the same ( at least at tree - level ) .",
    "they are described by the untwisted moduli of the heterotic string , or equivalently , the moduli coming from the untwisted closed string sector and the open string sector of the type i model ( these parametrize the coset @xmath118 ^ 3 $ ] ) , plus the @xmath132 twisted moduli in the heterotic string model , or equivalently , the moduli coming from the twisted closed string sector of the type i model . the ( perturbative ) moduli space ( of the heterotic model )",
    "is schematically depicted in fig.1 .",
    "it is worth noticing the role of anomalous @xmath1 in @xmath3 type i - heterotic duality . to cancel the fayet - illiopoulos @xmath50-term , fields that are charged under the anomalous @xmath1",
    "will generically acquire vevs . as a result",
    ", the extra twisted matter fields in the heterotic model are higgsed away and the matching of the massless spectra of the type i and heterotic models is precise .",
    "the appearance of massless twisted matter fields @xmath115 and @xmath116 on the heterotic side is a perturbative effect . on the type",
    "i side this effect is non - perturbative , and reflects the fact that from type i point of view there is a ( non - perturbative ) singularity in the moduli space ( or , more precisely , a singular subspace of the full moduli space ) .",
    "notice that the fields @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the heterotic model get heavy via couplings in the _ perturbative _ superpotential .",
    "this indicates the importance of perturbative superpotential in @xmath3 type i - heterotic duality .",
    "in this section we discuss the compactification of type i strings on @xmath6 orbifold . since @xmath6 has an order two element , we have to include both @xmath0- and @xmath5-branes .",

    "the heterotic dual of this model would correspond to a non - perturbative vacuum with small instantons .",
    "the @xmath148 sector gauge group can not be higgsed away completely ( due to the presence of a tree - level superpotential ) , but an @xmath158 gauge group ( with no charged matter ) remains .",

    "there are two kinds of constraints we need to consider .",
    "the first one comes from the cancellation of the untwisted tadpoles for the @xmath0-branes .",
    "this constraint is the same in all dimensions and leads to the statement that there are @xmath163 @xmath0-branes _ not _ counting the orientifold images .",
    "( this last statement is only correct if the ns - ns antisymmetric background @xmath61 is set equal to zero @xcite ; see below . )",
    "the other constraint comes from the cancellation of the twisted tadpoles for the @xmath0-branes .",
    "the twisted tadpoles have been computed for certain cases in six dimensions @xcite , and in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "the cases of @xmath164 orbifolds ( odd prime @xmath165 ) in general @xmath50 dimensions have been discussed in @xcite . here , we generalize these tadpole cancellation conditions to general abelian orbifolds with no order two element .",
    "consider compactification on @xmath15 where @xmath166 for odd integers @xmath167 .",
    "let @xmath168 be the generators of @xmath169 respectively .",
    "the corresponding twists are given by @xmath170 here @xmath171 are fractional numbers taking values in @xmath172 .",
    "a given @xmath171 corresponds to a twist of the @xmath173-th complex boson by a @xmath174 rotation .",
    "( we have complexified the @xmath175 real bosons into @xmath176 complex bosons . )",
    "the double vertical line separates the right- and left - movers of the string . because we are considering symmetric orbifold , the right- and left - moving twists are the same .",
    "the elements @xmath177 of the the orbifold group @xmath178 can be written as @xmath179 , where @xmath180 . the corresponding twist @xmath181 is defined by @xmath182 , so that @xmath183 .",
    "we note that the consistency of the orbifold requires that for each element @xmath177 the expression @xmath184 where the factors with @xmath185 are not included in the product , be an integer .",
    "in fact the latter is nothing but the number of fixed points ( tori ) in the @xmath181 twisted sector .",
    "the orbifold action on chan - paton factors is described by the unitary matrices @xmath186 that act on the string end - points . in our case",
    "@xmath186 is a @xmath187 matrix ( note that it is _ not _ a @xmath188 matrix because we have chosen _ not _ to count the orientifold images of the @xmath0-branes ) .",
    "since the orbifold is abelian , we can simultaneously diagonalize the matrices @xmath186 for each @xmath189 .",
    "then , the most general form of @xmath186 is given by @xmath190^{\\ell_1 ( \\alpha)},[\\omega ( \\alpha)]^{\\ell_2 ( \\alpha ) ] } , \\dots ,   [ \\omega ( \\alpha)]^{\\ell_{16 } ( \\alpha ) } ) ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath191 . here",
    "@xmath192 is the order of @xmath193 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the smallest integer such that @xmath194 for @xmath195 .",
    "the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions are thus @xmath196 for each @xmath189 .",
    "let us illustrate the above constraint by the @xmath22 orbifold considered in this paper : @xmath197 the tadpole cancellation conditions read : @xmath198 the conditions for all other @xmath199 can be derived from the ones above .",
    "the solutions for @xmath200 and @xmath201 are then : @xmath202 where @xmath203 denotes the @xmath204 unit matrix .",
    "thus , the gauge group is @xmath205 .",
    "here we also list a few non - supersymmetric models ( that have never been discussed previously to the best of our knowledge ) : + @xmath206 6d @xmath2 orbifold .",
    "the twists read : @xmath207 the gauge group is @xmath208 .",
    "+ @xmath206 4d @xmath2 orbifold .",
    "the twists read : @xmath209 the gauge group is @xmath210 .",
    "+ @xmath206 4d @xmath211 orbifold .",
    "the twists read : @xmath212 the gauge group is @xmath213 .",
    "+ @xmath206 4d @xmath214 orbifold .",
    "the twists read : @xmath215 the gauge group is @xmath213 .",
    "+ @xmath206 4d @xmath216 orbifold .",
    "the twist reads : @xmath217 the gauge group is @xmath213 .",
    "finally , we would like to consider the cases with non - zero ns - ns antisymmetric background @xmath61 .",
    "although there are no massless scalars corresponding to these in type i theory ( recall that there @xmath61 fields are projected out of the spectrum after orientifolding ) , @xmath61 can have certain quantized values .",
    "the quantization is due to the fact that to have a consistent orientifold the corresponding type iib spectrum must be left - right symmetric . at generic values of @xmath61 this symmetry is destroyed .",
    "there are , however , certain discrete @xmath61 backgrounds compatible with the orientifold projection @xcite .",
    "the effect of non - zero @xmath61 background is that the rank of the gauge group coming from the @xmath63 ( _ i.e. _ , chan - paton ) factor is reduced , depending on the rank @xmath218 ( which is always even ) of the matrix @xmath61 .",
    "that is , the number of the @xmath0-branes required by the tadpole cancellation condition is no longer @xmath163 but @xmath219 .",
    "all of the above formulas then get modified in the presence of rank @xmath218 @xmath61 in an obvious way via replacing the factor @xmath163 everywhere by @xmath219 .",
    "in this section we generalize the tadpole cancellation conditions discussed in appendix [ tadpoles ] to the cases with both @xmath0- and @xmath5-branes present . in order to have @xmath5-branes ,",
    "the orbifold group @xmath178 must contain an order two element @xmath161 .",
    "in general , there may be more than one order two elements @xmath220 in the orbifold group @xmath178 . then there will be corresponding @xmath221-branes for each of these elements . once the case with only one order two element is understood , the generalization to more general cases is relatively straightforward .",
    "let us , therefore , concentrate on the case where we have only one order two element @xmath222 .",
    "in fact , for now let us take the orbifold group @xmath223,where @xmath165 is odd .",
    "note that @xmath224 .",
    "we can write the group elements as @xmath225 ( note that @xmath226 ) .",
    "the orientifold group element @xmath33 gives rise to @xmath0-branes , whereas the element @xmath162 gives rise to @xmath5-branes .",
    "let us denote the open string chan - paton matrices as @xmath227 for the @xmath0-branes , and as @xmath228 for the @xmath5-branes . here",
    "@xmath229 , and the matrices with index @xmath230 even correspond to the @xmath231 twists , whereas those with the index @xmath230 odd correspond to the @xmath232 twists .",
    "note that the untwisted chan - paton matrices are given by @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is a @xmath187 identity matrix .",
    "this latter fact follows from the untwisted tadpole cancellation conditions that require presence of 16 @xmath0-branes and 16 @xmath5-branes ( we are not counting the orientifold images here ) .",
    "next , we need to understand the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions . here",
    "we will write the general form of these conditions .",
    "the contributions to the twisted tadpoles come from the klein bottle @xmath235 , cylinder @xmath236 and mbius strip @xmath237 ( the total twisted tadpole is the sum @xmath238 ) : @xmath239 here @xmath240 .",
    "note that in the klein bottle @xmath235 and mbius strip @xmath237 tadpoles we must _ not _ include the terms with @xmath241 .",
    "the klein bottle contributions @xmath242 , as well as the coefficients @xmath243 , are given by certain numerical factors independent of the chan - paton matrices .",
    "note that according to the composition algebra for the matrices @xmath244 and @xmath245 we have : @xmath246 where @xmath247 and @xmath248 take values @xmath249 .",
    "next note that since @xmath250 , we can rewrite the total twisted tadpole @xmath251 as a sum of two pieces @xmath252 , where @xmath253 here @xmath254 , and similarly for @xmath255 . from the above expressions it is clear that in order for the twisted tadpoles to cancel it must be the case that they cancel in @xmath256 and @xmath257 independently .",
    "in fact , the tadpoles must factor into sums of perfect squares .",
    "thus , for @xmath256 we have @xmath258 where we have used the identity @xmath259 which follows from the @xmath11-duality of @xmath0- and @xmath5-branes .",
    "the @xmath11-duality also implies that we can set ( up to an irrelevant overall phase ) @xmath260 , and as an immediate consequence we get the following twisted tadpole cancellation conditions : @xmath261 the rest of the twisted tadpole cancellation conditions are for the chan - paton matrices @xmath262 , @xmath263 . these tadpole cancellation conditions are exactly the same as for the @xmath20 orbifold with @xmath165 odd , and we have already discussed them in the previous section .",
    "it is clear now how to construct the chan - paton matrices for @xmath264 orbifolds ( @xmath165 is odd ) .",
    "the chan - paton matrices for the @xmath0- and @xmath5-branes are the same .",
    "thus , we will confine our attention to the @xmath0-brane matrices .",
    "those for the twists @xmath231 are given in the previous section .",
    "the matrix @xmath265 . also , @xmath266 .",
    "the form of @xmath267 is then fixed ( up to equivalent representations ) by the constraints on @xmath268 ( this fixes the diagonal elements up to certain permutations ) and @xmath269 ( this fixes the positions of the diagonal elements in @xmath267 in the basis where @xmath265 ; there is still a residual permutational symmetry , but the latter is irrelevant ) .",
    "let us illustrate the above conditions by the @xmath6 orbifold considered in this paper .",
    "the twists read : @xmath270 we have the following chan - paton matrices : @xmath271 thus , the gauge group is @xmath21 in the 99 sector . it is the same in the 55 sector if all the @xmath5-branes are located at the same fixed point .",
    "note that although so far we have discussed only the case of @xmath264 orbifolds ( @xmath165 is odd ) , the tadplole cancellation conditions are staightforward to generalize to @xmath272 orbifolds , where @xmath273 are odd integers .",
    "( here we imply type i orbifolds with @xmath0- and @xmath5-branes only . )",
