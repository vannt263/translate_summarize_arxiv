    "while a complete understanding of quantum entanglement and correlations in an atomic lattice model remains a significant challenge even in theoretical terms @xcite , much has been understood for an important type of correlation , the so - called spin squeezing , or pseudo spin squeezing . for those systems that undergo quantum phase transitions , the presence and",
    "the measure of entanglement is important not only at the transition point , but also for the different phases of the system .",
    "these systems show various behaviors , entanglement and disentanglement , coherent and squeezed spin states , mode and particle entanglement for different phases that can be controlled by interaction types and strengths as well as lattice configurations .    squeezed spin states are states whose spin fluctuation in one of the transverse spin components is below the standard quantum limit .",

    "spin squeezing can occur in many models with a variety of atom - atom interactions @xcite , for atomic condensates inside external traps @xcite , and for atoms inside optical lattices @xcite .",

    "the interaction term in the bose - hubbard model for the optical lattices , e.g. the interaction terms in ( [ bh - ham ] ) , is due to atom - atom collisions which can happen only locally , so that it is an on - site interaction .",

    "a generalization of the method is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . at non - zero temperatures it is more crucial to test predictions of mft for low dimensional systems against numerical tests . for spin-1 systems ,",
    "detailed numerical studies became only very recently available  @xcite ; but they have ensured that similar level of agreement between the mft predictions and numerical studies as in spinless systems do occur for the case of spin-1 systems .    in order to test the validity of mft that we use in our model , we studied a simple lattice model having two sites .",
    "we used the bose - hubbard hamiltonian in ( [ bh - ham ] ) and @xmath19 runs from 1 to 2 with the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the purpose of this calculation is to investigate the effect of inter - site interaction on the single - site state .",
    "the exact ground state calculations were done by using those parameter values corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath26 mott phases in the phase diagrams both for the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regimes in the case of @xmath27 and for a small @xmath21 value .",
    "once the exact two - site ground state is determined , we calculate the one - site density matrix by tracing out the other site . following this procedure ,",
    "the overlap of ground states from mft and exact two - site model can be computed .",
    "our results show that most of these overlap values are above 0.95 , confirming the success of mft in calculating one - site ground states and so that using it to quantify correlations among particles in a single site .    in general , many - body wave functions are too complicated to express explicitly , but mft allows for writing down analytical wave functions of the ground states and hence one can gain valuable insights into the quantum correlations in such complex many - body systems such as spinor condensates in optical lattices .",
    "this insight should serve as a guide even for comprehending quantum correlations among the lattice sites which require beyond mft calculations , but can still be performed through perturbative examinations of mean field ground states .",

    "particle entanglement thus exists for atoms in the non - degenerate ground state modes , which become degenerate for the special case of a lattice with @xmath27 .",
    "squeezed spin states defined by kitagawa and ueda @xcite is widely used in atomic physics , especially in the context of particle correlation and entanglement .",
    "a criterion was found recently connecting many atom entanglement and correlation originally from atoms in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite . if the squeezing parameter @xmath44 is smaller than 1 , the two mode bosonic many atom state under consideration is spin squeezed along the direction of @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 is the total pseudo spin operator , while @xmath45 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 denote three orthogonal axes .",
    "the condition for @xmath49 coincides with the non - separability criterion of a density matrix for @xmath50 two state boson @xcite .",

    "our results show clearly the existence of quantum correlations between atoms on the same lattice site .    to identify pairwise entanglement in our many - body system , we can make use of a direct relationship between concurrence @xcite , which is well - known and represents a widely accepted measure of bipartite entanglement , and spin squeezing criterion @xcite .",
    "thus , we take ( [ squ - cri ] ) as an indicator for two - particle entanglement .",
    "we will in addition also calculate the concurrence and compare the results with the squeezing parameter ( [ squ - cri ] ) .    in view of the significant difficulties of measuring spin squeezing along any arbitrary direction @xmath45 , our investigation will focus on the simplest case of a single orthogonal configuration with three fixed axes .",
    "other orthogonal axes configurations may be sequentially searched for if the optimal squeezing is to be found . for this aim",
    "we only need to rotate the coordinate system about each of the axes by an angle @xmath53 .",
    "for example if the rotation is about the axis-3 , @xmath54 remains the same , while the squeezing parameters for the new axis-1 and axis-2 become @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",

    "on the other hand , the interaction term dominates so that the ground state exhibits minimal number fluctuation and corresponds to a product of atom fock number states at each lattice site , which in turn gives @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "we have performed numerical diagonalization of the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ mf - ham ] ) by using a set of states expanded in terms of the product of individual atom number states @xmath60 while performing this diagonalization , two different regimes with respect to the same parameter @xmath13 must be carried out .",
    "one is for a positive antisymmetric coupling , with a corresponding antiferromagnetic ground state , where individual spins are anti - aligned due to spin - exchange interaction .",
    "the other case is ferromagnetic for a negative spin exchange interaction .",
    "in addition , we explore the dependence of our results on the small , but non - vanishing lattice parameter @xmath21 , which introduces a spin dependent lattice potential .",
    "we study the parameter regions corresponding to those considered in ref .",

    "this procedure is iterated to reach a self - consistent solution , with which it becomes straightforward to calculate the expectation values and the second moments of the operators in ( [ operators ] ) .    to conveniently calculate the squeezing parameter @xmath67 ( [ squ - cri ] )",
    ", we use the average total occupation number @xmath68 for each type of interactions to label the different phases instead of relying on the total number of atoms @xmath50 ( per site ) .",
    "this implicitly assumes that the squeezing parameter ( [ squ - cri ] ) remains a valid criterion of quantum entanglement even for non - integer occupation numbers such as in the superfluid phase .",
    "this assumption does not introduce any inconvenience in a mott phase since the ground state consists of fock states with equal total number of particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , definite spin and thus @xmath68 becomes an integer . in the superfluid phase ,",
    "we justify the use of a non - integer @xmath68 in the following manner . in this section , we calculate the squeezing parameter in two different ways for each case .",
    "the first method uses @xmath69 directly for the entanglement measure .",
    "the second method is analogous in form , but only uses integer values of @xmath68 . for the superfluid phase , instead of talking about separability for states with different total number of particles , we focus on the subspace @xmath70 block and investigate its correlation .",
    "this becomes a meaningful measure when the block we use is the one with the nearest integer total number of particles to @xmath68 .",
    "this method has a similar nature as the superselection rules mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite since the projection of the hilbert space onto a subspace of fixed particle number is considered .",
    "both methods are found to give similar behaviors for the superfluid and the mott insulator phases .",
    "we provide results from the first method in our discussion because they respect the collective nature of the superfluid state and emphasize particle number fluctuations .",
    "there also exist states for which spin squeezing parameter can not be readily used to characterize their correlation properties .",
    "an example is the maximally entangled states ( mes ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are not squeezed spin states according to the criterion in ( [ squ - cri ] ) . in this case",
    ", it is inadequate to talk about squeezing , since the uncertainty in the perpendicular components to the mean isospin vector are meaningless as the denominator for the squeezing measure ( [ squ - cri ] ) vanishes for all axes .",
    "in addition , there exist other states , although whose averaged mean isospin are nonzero , the expectation values for the two components in the denominator might vanish , also making the spin squeezing parameter @xmath71 not well defined . in our studies , we find that these states happen only in certain mott phases , where exact wave functions are available either analytically in the spin @xcite or fock basis @xcite . as such , their quantum entanglement properties can be discussed directly using other criteria .    in order to quantify the pairwise quantum correlations both in the superfluid and mott - insulator regimes , in addition to the squeezing parameter , we use the well - known criterion called concurrence @xcite . for a given two - party state @xmath72 ,",
    "this measure is equal to @xmath73 where @xmath74 s are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath75 in decreasing order where @xmath76    for the @xmath25 mott - insulator phase , this measure is trivial since there is only one particle present .",
    "when it comes to the @xmath26 mott phase , concurrence clearly quantifies pairwise correlations between the two atoms at the same lattice site . in the superfluid phase ,",
    "the ground state is a superposition of fock states with different number of atoms or isospin states with different isospins , we again focus on the subspace with the nearest integer total number of particles @xmath70 .",
    "if the nearest integer is smaller than two , then concurrence is zero .",
    "if it is equal to two , the concurrence is simply calculated . when it is equal to three , the three - particle ground state is symmetrized in the first quantization picture and we use reduced two - body density matrix to calculate concurrence .",
    "we report below our investigation of quantum entanglement in our model system for the two regimes : antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions .      for ferromagnetic interaction with @xmath40 , for @xmath27 , and a fixed @xmath61 value , the dependence of the order parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 on the quantity @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
