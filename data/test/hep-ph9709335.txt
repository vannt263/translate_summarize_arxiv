    ", it addressed the following questions :    * can one identify a signal for new physics ? *",
    "if so , can one tell that the new physics is supersymmetry ? * if it is supersymmetry , can one distinguish between various models and measure the underlying parameters ?",

    "the mssm couplings are assumed to respect @xmath2-parity , which implies that superparticles must be pair produced and that the lightest supersymmetric particle must be stable .",
    "the mssm contains two types of parameters .",

    "[ rng ] .",
    "= 3.2 in    the msugra scenario involves several bold assumptions , any one of which might well be wrong @xcite , but it has the tremendous advantage that it reduces the parameter space to just five new parameters : a universal scalar mass , @xmath7 , a universal gaugino mass , @xmath8 , a universal trilinear scalar coupling , @xmath9 , a higgs mass , @xmath10 , and the supersymmetric higgsino mass , @xmath3 .",
    "it is also consistent with all experimental data to date .",
    "the msugra scenario has the additional attraction that radiative corrections from the heavy top quark drive electroweak symmetry breaking , as shown in fig .",
    "this allows one to trade @xmath11 and @xmath10 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the ratio of higgs vevs .",
    "therefore , in the msugra scenario , the final parameter space is simply : @xmath14 together with the sign of @xmath3 .",

    "according to its design specifications , the lhc is a 14 tev @xmath0 collider , capable of achieving an annual integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath31 . for the snowmass study",
    ", it proved sufficient to consider a low - luminosity option , with just 10 fb@xmath31 per year .",
    "crudely speaking , the lhc provides two intense beams of quarks and gluons which collide with a center - of - mass energy in the range of a few tev .",
    "therefore , a classic supersymmetry signature is given by @xmath32 where one gluino decays to two jets and missing energy and the other decays to two jets , a lepton , plus missing energy .",
    "this suggests that a supersymmetry search start with events which contain one lepton , jets and missing energy .",

    "the reach is only weakly sensitive to this choice . in the figure , the bricked ( hatched ) region",
    "is excluded by theoretical ( experimental ) constraints .    from the figure",
    "we see that the lhc gives a gluino reach of between 1.5 and 2.5 tev , with just 10 fb@xmath31 of luminosity .",
    "in fact , the lhc subgroup showed that the same cuts and luminosity can be used to detect squarks and gluinos with masses of up to 1 tev in supersymmetry _ without _",
    "@xmath2-parity @xcite .",
    "( with optimized cuts , the lhc can do even better . )",
    "taken together , these statements form the basis for the assertion that the lhc will probe the entire parameter space of interest for weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "= 3.2 in    the nlc , of course , is at an earlier stage of development , so its specifications are less certain . for the snowmass workshop ,",
    "the nlc was _ defined _ to be a linear @xmath1 collider with a center of mass energy between 500 gev and 1.5 tev .",
    "the luminosity was assumed to be 50 fb@xmath31 per year at 500 gev and up to 200 fb@xmath31 at 1.5 tev .",
    "it was also assumed that the electrons could be 80% polarized .    at the nlc , two classic supersymmetry signatures are chargino and selectron production , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in each case ,",
    "the strategy is to tune the beam energy and search for central events .",
    "the corresponding reach plot is shown in fig .  [",
    "reach ] @xcite . from the figure",
    "we see that the reach of a 1.2 @xmath39 1.5 tev nlc is comparable to that of the lhc .",
    "it is important to note , though , that at each machine , the quoted reach is achieved through different channels .",
    "the lhc reach relies on gluinos , while that of the nlc derives from charginos and sleptons . in the msugra scenario",
    ", the lighter mass of the charginos and sleptons tends to compensate the lower energy of the nlc machine .",
    "while this is a reasonable guess , it is by no means assured that supersymmetry works out this way .",
    "the issue of reach is important , but it is just the first step in the experimental analysis of supersymmetry .",
    "one would like to go further and test the expected relations between the supersymmetric parameters and measure the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters . in this way one can establish whether an observed signal is actually supersymmetry and examine whether it is compatible with msugra or some other supersymmetric framework . to see what can be done",
    ", one needs to work with a complete model in which one can analyze a variety of experimental signatures .    at snowmass",
    "the supersymmetry working group studied representative points in the msugra parameter space , five for each machine .",
    "one point , the snowmass comparison point , was chosen to be the same for each : @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 gev , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and sign(@xmath44 . for this choice , @xmath45 gev , with the first two generations of squarks about 20  gev heavier .",
    "the slepton masses range between 206 and 216 gev .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath20 masses are 96 and 97 gev , while the @xmath18 mass is 45 gev .",
    "the heavier charginos and neutralino masses are between 260 and 270 gev .",
    "the lighter stop ( sbottom ) mass is 264 ( 278 ) gev , while the corresponding heavier states are more massive than the gluino .    note that at the comparison point , all the superparticle masses are rather light .",
    "this affects the analysis in at least two ways .",
    "the light masses help the lhc because they increase the supersymmetry cross sections .",
    "this allowed the lhc subgroup to make hard cuts to isolate pure samples of supersymmetric events .",
    "the light masses help the nlc as well because they decrease the energy requirements .",
    "in particular , at the comparison point , a 500 gev nlc is able to access much of the supersymmetric physics .",
    "note too that in this scenario , the higgs mass is just 68 gev , so the higgs would probably have been discovered after snowmass but before susy97 !",
    "the analyses at the comparison point take advantage of the following decay chains .    1 .",
    "the lightest neutralino is primarily bino and the lightest chargino is mostly wino , so the decay into a charged lepton @xmath46 , @xmath47 has a branching ratio of 22% . likewise , the decay into jets , @xmath48 has a branching ratio of 66% .",
    "the second - lightest neutralino is primarily wino .",
    "its decay into charged leptons @xmath49 has a branching ratio of 33% .",
    "3 .   because @xmath50 , but @xmath51 for the first two generations , the decay chain @xmath52 has a branching ratio of 25% . this gives rise to spectacular signatures with multiple @xmath53 jets , leptons and missing energy .      at the lhc ,",
    "the analysis of supersymmetry is likely to be quite complicated because all the superpartners are produced at once .",
    "indeed , it is often said that at the lhc , the  background to supersymmetry is supersymmetry . \"",
    "this suggests a systematic approach , perhaps along the following lines :    1 .",
    "determine the supersymmetry scale ; 2 .",
    "study the clean decay chains ; and 3 .   test specific models by performing global fits to the data .",
    "at snowmass , the lhc subgroup carried out such an analysis for the comparison point @xcite .",
    "= 3.1 in    the first step is to determine the overall scale of supersymmetry , which can be defined as the smaller of the squark or gluino mass , @xmath54 the lhc subgroup proposed the following technique .",
    "one first selects a sample of events with at least four jets , no leptons and substantial missing energy .",
    "one then computes the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the four hardest jets , plus the missing energy , @xmath55 for each event .",
    "it turns out that the peak in the @xmath56 distribution is closely correlated with @xmath57 , at least in the msugra scenario @xcite .",
    "the lhc subgroup illustrated this procedure for 100 msugra models ( with the same higgs mass ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ meff ] , where one sees that the ratio @xmath58 is essentially constant .",
    "indeed , one finds @xmath59 to within 10% , at least within the class of msugra models discussed here @xcite .",
    "the lhc subgroup then turned its attention to the clean decay chains .",
    "such an analysis is easiest if one starts with a relatively pure sample of supersymmetry events . for the snowmass comparison point , there are 13.5 _ million _ supersymmetry events per 10 fb@xmath31 of luminosity .",
    "this permits hard cuts to isolate pure samples of supersymmetric decays .    as discussed above , at the snowmass point , the decay @xmath60 has a branching ratio of 25% . with 10 fb@xmath31 of luminosity and a tagging efficiency of 60% ( and @xmath61 misidentification of 10% ) per @xmath53-jet , this gives rise to 272k events which contain four @xmath53 jets and two pairs of opposite - sign same - flavor leptons .",
    "moreover , if one of the @xmath20 is allowed to decay hadronically , there are another 694k events with four @xmath53 jets , two non-@xmath53 jets and one pair of opposite - sign same - flavor leptons .",
    "this suggests that the supersymmetry sample be selected to contain four or more jets , with at least two tagged as @xmath53-jets and one or more pairs of opposite - sign same - flavor leptons .",
    "the lhc subgroup collected such a sample and plotted the dilepton mass distribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ chi2-chi1 ] @xcite . by fitting the sharp edge of the distribution",
    ", they determined that the mass difference @xmath62 can be measured to @xmath63 mev !",
    "this incredible precision follows from the fact that the measurement is systematics limited and the dilepton mass can be calibrated against @xmath15 .",
    "= 3.1 in    the subgroup then used the technique of partial reconstruction , first developed for @xmath64 decays @xcite , to show that the difference @xmath65 can be measured to @xmath66 gev @xcite .",
    "the technique goes as follows .",
    "one first selects events near the edge of the @xmath67 mass distribution .",
    "since the leptons come from the decay chain @xmath68 the events near the edge originate in decays in which the @xmath18 and the @xmath67 pair are at rest in the rest frame of the @xmath69 .",
    "if one then _ assumes _ some mass for the @xmath18 , one can boost back to the lab and reconstruct the entire event .",
    "about 6000 gluino and sbottom events can be reconstructed in this way per 10 fb@xmath31 of luminosity at the lhc .",
    "= 3.1 in    = 3.1 in    using this technique and assuming a value for @xmath70 , one can measure the mass of the @xmath71 , as well as the mass difference @xmath72 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ bsquark ] and [ gluino - bsquark ] . by varying the value of @xmath70",
    ", one can show that @xmath73 is essentially independent of the assumption , up to an error of @xmath66 gev .",

    "the final step in the analysis is to try to determine the soft supersymmetry - breaking parameters . at the lhc ,",
    "this might be accomplished by performing a global fit to the data .",
    "if one is lucky , and the soft parameters originate in some simple model , such as msugra or gauge mediation , the fit will agree with the data . if not , and all 100 parameters need to be measured independently , the global fit will not work and one will be forced to try something else .",
    "for the case at hand , the global fit works very well . the measured inputs @xmath76 ( where the higgs mass measurement comes from lep , and the error is purely theoretical ) , imply @xmath77    the fit works as follows : since the @xmath20 and @xmath18 are effectively wino and bino , the value of @xmath8 is fixed by @xmath78 .",
    "this , in turn , gives @xmath70 in the msugra scenario .",
    "partial reconstruction then determines @xmath79 , hence @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath80 is sufficient to fix @xmath13 .    given this global fit , one can carry out many cross checks to test the consistency of the solution .",
    "for example , once @xmath8 is known , the gluino mass can be predicted and compared with experiment .",
    "similarly , the event rates and branching ratios can be used to test the fit .",
    "supersymmetry studies at the nlc exploit the facts that the beam energy is adjustable , the electron polarization can be varied , and signal events are central .",
    "the adjustable energy helps one to produce just the particles of interest , while the polarization and event shape help to separate the signal from the background .",
    "operation near threshold permits accurate mass measurements , while precise knowledge of the collision energy greatly facilitates the reconstruction of events with undetected particles in the final state .",
    "these facts are illustrated in fig .",
