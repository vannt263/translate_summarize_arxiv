    "the experimental realization of quantum condensation of quasiparticles with finite lifetimes has opened the possibility to study situations where the steady states of the condensate are not just controlled by energetics , but involve also consideration of pumping and decay , leading to steady states with quasiparticle currents .",
    "the exploration of the possible behavior exhibited in these systems is driven particularly by recent experimental progress in microcavity polaritons@xcite and magnons@xcite ( as well as more exotic realizations in helium@xcite ) .",
    "microcavity polaritons are the quasiparticles that result from strong coupling between photons confined in planar semiconductor microcavities and excitons confined in quantum wells .",
    "the photons are confined by bragg reflectors to a two - dimensional cavity , and for small in - plane momentum have an effectively quadratic dispersion , with a mass of the order of @xmath0  @xmath1 of the free electron mass . from strong coupling between these photon states and exciton states in quantum wells ,",
    "new normal modes arise : polaritons .",
    "these are hybrid light  matter particles , which have both a light effective mass , as well as sufficient interactions to allow a quasi - equilibrium particle distribution to be established . however , the distribution is only quasi - equilibrium , since the photon component is not perfectly confined , so polaritons have a finite lifetime , and to maintain a steady state population , continuous pumping is required . even when the energy distribution of polaritons looks reasonably thermal , this does not mean effects of finite lifetime may be neglected , as one may have thermalized energy distributions on top of steady state flows driven by the pumping and decay .",
    "experimentally , it is observed that above a threshold pumping strength , an accumulation of low energy polaritons is accompanied by : a significant increase in temporal coherence , spatial coherence that extends over the entire cloud of polaritons@xcite , the appearance of quantized vortices@xcite , suggestions of changes to the excitation spectrum@xcite , and a robustness of polariton propagation to disorder@xcite . of these , the observation of spontaneous vortices@xcite in polariton condensates provides a strong hint that the steady states of the system are affected by the flow of particles . for a more general introduction to microcavity polaritons , their condensation , and the physical systems studied there exist several reviews or books , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "the aim of this article is to investigate the rich varieties of behavior that come from combining spatial profiles driven by particle flow with the dynamics due to the spin degree of freedom that microcavity polaritons also possess .",
    "the effects of this spin degree of freedom have been previously considered in equilibrium : due to the weak attractive interaction between opposite spin polarizations , a condensate is expected to be linearly polarized@xcite , i.e. , to have an equal density of left- and right - circularly polarized components . applying a magnetic field",
    "can then lead to a phase transition , as the density of one circular polarization increases , and the other decreases , leading through an elliptically polarized phase to a single circularly polarized condensate@xcite . in the absence of further symmetry breaking , the linear or elliptically polarized phase has two gapless modes , corresponding to two broken symmetries : the overall polariton phase , and the direction of linear polarization ( i.e. , orientation of elliptical polarization ) .",
    "the transition to a circular polarized state is thus a phase transition , as such a phase has only a single broken symmetry , and a single gapless mode .    assuming no other symmetry breaking terms",
    ", the linearly polarized condensate can have independent vortices of the left- and right - circularly polarized components@xcite ; such polarization - dependent phase winding has recently been observed@xcite .",
    "these two vortices are not completely independent . even in the absence of any further symmetry breaking ,",
    "there is a short - range density - density interaction between vortices of opposite polarizations@xcite , however such a term does not depend on the circulations of the two vortices .",
    "if one also takes account of te - tm splitting of the electromagnetic modes@xcite , this leads to a term that splits linear polarization states according to whether the polarization is parallel or perpendicular to the polariton momentum ; as such , this provides a circulation dependent interaction between vortices of the two polarizations@xcite .",
    "in addition , real materials are expected to possess a small splitting between linear polarization states due to asymmetry of the quantum - well interfaces in non - centro - symmetric crystals@xcite ; such a splitting can also be controlled by applying electrostatic fields@xcite or stress@xcite .",
    "such terms will again induce interactions between vortices of the left- and right - circular polarization , and if strong enough , will lead to a pinning of the polarization of a polariton condensate , as has been observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "considering the splitting of linear polarizations as a phase - locking term between the two circular polarization components , and combining this with a magnetic field that favors one or other circular polarization , one has a josephson problem@xcite , where the energy favoring linear polarization is a josephson coupling , and the magnetic field leads to a bias between the two fields .",
    "@xcite have considered the interplay between these spinor josephson oscillations , and josephson coupling between two different spatial modes of a trapped polariton condensate , showing that complex behavior can arise in this four - mode system without pumping and decay .",
    "a similar problem has also been studied in the context of spinor condensates of cold atoms in double well potentials@xcite .",
    "if one does include pumping and decay then even the two - mode system ( i.e. , just the dynamics of the spin component ) can show a rich variety of behavior @xcite .",
    "due to dissipation , the dynamics settles on an attractor , which may either correspond to a phase - locked ( i.e. , linearly polarized ) state , or may correspond to a limit cycle , in which the phase difference between the two polarization components continually increases , with the cyclic nature arising from @xmath2 periodicity in the phase difference .",
    "there also exist parameter ranges where there is bistability , so that which attractor the system settles on depends on the initial conditions . in this article , we will both review this two - mode dynamics , and then extend to the case of including many spatial modes in addition to the spin dynamics .    to describe multiple spatial modes in a trapped , pumped , decaying condensate , a mean - field approach to this problem leads to a complex gross  pitaevskii equation@xcite .",
    "it is also possible to include fluctuations beyond mean - field theory within such a formalism by quantum stochastic approaches@xcite . as well as describing the spatial structure of nonequilibrium condensates ,",
    "the complex gross  pitaevskii equation has also been applied in a wide range of areas , see for example refs .  .",
    "one application which is very closely connected to microcavity polaritons is the dynamics of lasers propagating through strongly nonlinear materials , where combinations of cubic and quintic nonlinearities can produce a state with a preferred density , sometimes referred to as `` liquid light''@xcite .",
    "the results in this article suggest that consideration of polarization dynamics in such materials may also provide interesting results .    by considering the spinor complex gross  pitaevskii equation to describe the spinor condensate in an harmonic trap ,",
    "several new classes of attractors are seen to occur in addition to those present for the two - mode system .",
    "there are limit cycles describing small oscillations of the phase difference between the two components , and limit cycles with @xmath3 periodicity of the phase difference .",
    "in addition , the different dynamical attractors correspond to different spatial profiles , in which the presence or absence of vortex lattices can be influenced by the applied magnetic fields .    as well as describing the steady state profiles",
    ", the complex gross  pitaevskii equation can describe the normal modes for small fluctuations about such steady states . in the absence of a spatial trap , one notable consequence of including pumping and decay",
    "is that the long - wavelength modes of a dissipative condensate are modified , to become diffusive@xcite ; similar results are seen both for incoherent pumped condensates , and for optical parametric oscillation , where scattering of pumped polaritons into signal and idler states is modified by bosonic enhancement due to the population of the signal@xcite . from this standpoint , another purpose of this article is to address how the combination of pumping , decay , and symmetry - breaking terms modify the spectrum of the spinor condensate . while a diffusive mode for the overall polariton density and phase always exists , the long - wavelength modes for spin modes can show a range of behaviors : diffusive , linearly dispersing , or gapped , dependent on the balance of decay and symmetry - breaking terms .",

    ", @xmath27 determines whether the system forms vortices spontaneously@xcite .",
    "in order to provide a basis from which to understand the behavior observed in the trapped system , it is first useful to review the results that occur in the `` two - mode model '' , where spatial variation of each component is neglected , so the coupled complex gross  pitaevskii equation reduces to two equations for the variables @xmath29 .",
