    "however , the range of voltages where switching is important , is narrow .",
    "since the nanotube is attached to the electrodes by tunneling contacts , it is in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "we define the energy to add the @xmath55th electron to the tube as @xmath72 .",
    "then , if the nanotube contains @xmath73 electrons , the conditions that current can not flow ( is coulomb blocked ) are @xmath74 . in quantum dots , @xmath75 depends linearly on the bias @xmath0 and gate @xmath76 voltages .",

    "their size is also not the same and decreases with @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the mechanical degrees of freedom _ affect _ the coulomb blockade diamonds .",

    "1 again presents the schematic setup , but the suspended tube is placed between two gates , labeled up ( u ) and down ( d ) . since up and down capacitances are connected in parallel , their sum @xmath80 matters . assuming that the distance of the straight tube to both gates is the same , we write @xmath81 expanding this for @xmath19 and calculating the electrostatic force , we arrive at an equation similar to eq .",

    "multiple solutions emerge ; the ones with the lowest energy are @xmath86 thus , the tube in the strong - bending regime can oscillate between the two symmetric positions .",
    "this creates a basis for observation of quantum effects , as discussed in ref . .",
    "we emphasize once again , that within this model , the multi - stability is due to the charging of the tube in combination with the non - linearity .",
    "the eigenfrequency of a particular eigenmode is an important directly measurable@xcite property . in future experiments on suspended tubes",
    "we expect that the eigenmodes influence tunneling ( `` phonon - assisted tunneling '' ) in a similar way as observed for a single @xmath87 molecule  @xcite .",
    "below , we demonstrate that the effect of the electrostatic interactions on the elastic properties ( specifically , eigenfrequencies ) is strong and changes the behavior qualitatively .    to find the eigenmodes , we apply a gate voltage with a large dc ( single gate ) and a small ac component .",

    "the self - consistency procedure is essentially the same and again leads to eq .",
    "( [ stress2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the dc component of the gate voltage determines the stress @xmath12 and it therefore controls the eigenmodes .",
    "the frequencies of the ( transverse ) eigenmodes are found from the requirement that the equation @xmath94 with the boundary condition @xmath95 has a non - zero solution .",

    "furthermore , one should realize that frequency quantization is only observable if the frequency itself is greater than the inverse tunneling time for electrons .",

    "it further drops to zero at the euler instability threshold .",
    "the qualitative difference between the various regimes means that by measuring the gate voltage dependence of @xmath98 one can determine the sign of @xmath11 and get a quantitative estimate . on the other side ,",
