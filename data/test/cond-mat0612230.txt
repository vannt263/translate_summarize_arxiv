    "the kondo necklace ( kn ) type models are useful to discuss the quantum phase transitions between kondo singlet and antiferromagnetically ordered states such as found in heavy fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "they have been originally proposed by doniach @xcite for the one - dimensional case as a simplified version of the itinerant kondo lattice ( kl ) models @xcite . thereby the kinetic energy of conduction electrons is replaced by an intersite exchange term . for a pure xy - type intersite exchange",
    "this may be obtained by a jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "however in higher d the replacement can not be justified easily .",
    "the intuitive argument is that at low temperatures the charge fluctuations in the kondo lattice model are frozen out and the remaining spin fluctuation spectrum can be simulated by an antiferromagnetic inter - site interaction term of immobile @xmath1 spins coupled by a kondo interaction to the local noninteracting spins * s*. recent exact diagonalisation studies on finite clusters for both kondo lattice and kondo necklace models have indeed found that the competition between on - site kondo singlet formation and af inter - site correlations are very similar in both models @xcite .",
    "a more formal way to get rid of charge fluctuations in the kl model is an inclusion of a hubbard term for conduction electrons ( klu model ) which leads to the isotropic kn model in the large u limit at half filling",
    ".    nevertheless one should consider the kondo necklace model for d@xmath22 as a model in its own right which is suitable for studying quantum phase transitions between a kondo singlet ( ks ) and an antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase . in its original form",
    "the local kondo exchange is isotropic while the intersite exchange is of xy - type .",
    "this model has u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "later more general models with arbitrary anisotropy of kondo as well as intersite exchange terms have been considered @xcite . indeed compounds which exhibit the ks to af quantum phase transition have mostly uniaxial symmetries .",
    "a full account of the influence of uniaxial anisotropies of both terms in the kondo necklace hamiltonian on the quantum critical point has been given in ref . .",
    "the d=2 kn model without any anisotropy may also be understood as a special case of a bilayer heisenberg model @xcite where the intersite bonds are cut in one of the layers .",
    "a reintroduction of holes in this case leads to the kntj model which is related to the klu model away from half filling @xcite .    in the general anisotropic kn model the quantum phase transition",
    "is achieved by varying the ratio of hopping t , i.e. , the intersite interactions of @xmath1 spins to the on - site kondo interaction j. in practice this is achieved by varying pressure ( hydrostatic or chemical ) .",
    "an alternative way to arrive at the qcp is to apply an external magnetic field which breaks the local kondo singlets and leads to a field dependence of the critical t@xmath0 . starting from a noncritical or above critical t at zero field the system",
    "may then be tuned to the qcp by varying the field strength .",
    "this is indeed a practical method frequently applied @xcite . to investigate field - induced quantum phase transitions from kondo singlet to",
    "af ordered state or vice versa we have extended our previous work to include the effect of the magnetic field within the kondo necklace model .",
    "however , this introduces an additional parameter , namely the ratio of effective g- factors for the local kondo spins and the interacting spins",
    ". they can be different due to the different strength of spin - orbit coupling and crystalline electric field effects involved in the formation of the @xmath1 and * s * ( pseudo- ) spins . a mainly numerical study of the itinerant isotropic kl model in a magnetic field has been given previously @xcite .    in sec .",

    "[ sec3 ] we perform the transformation from spin to bosonic variables and in sec .

    "to investigate field induced quantum critical behaviour we start from the anisotropic kondo necklace ( kn ) model with u(1 ) symmetry @xcite where the field is applied along the anisotropy ( z ) direction : & = & _ t+_j+_z + & = & t_<n , m > ( _ n^x _ m^x + _ n^y _ m^y +",

    "the local anisotropy parameter @xmath8 is defined by the relation j@xmath9=@xmath8j@xmath10 between the z - axis and in - plane ( xy ) local exchange .",
    "the hopping parameter of the itinerant electrons is proportional to @xmath11 with the anisotropy in the z - direction given by @xmath12 .",
    "the present model has three control parameters : @xmath13 and the anisotropy parameters ( @xmath12,@xmath8 ) . in the zeeman term we defined @xmath14 and @xmath15 with h = @xmath16h where h is the strength of the applied field .",
    "furthermore @xmath17 and g@xmath18 are the gyromagnetic ratios for localised ( @xmath6 ) and itinerant ( @xmath3 ) spins respectively .",
    "they are determined by the combined effect of spin - orbit coupling and crystalline electric fields which depends on the degree of localisation or itineracy of electrons .",
    "therefore g@xmath19 and g@xmath18 in general need not be equal .",
    "we shall consider two extreme cases , namely ( @xmath20)=(2,0 ) and ( @xmath20)=(2,2 ) .",
    "the former is more realistic , since in real heavy fermion compounds most of the magnetic response is due to the localised electrons with pseudo - spin * s*. as in previous work @xcite the present study of field induced quantum phase transitions in the anisotropic kn model is based on the bond operator formulation .",
    "its hilbert space is spanned by local singlet - triplet states of ( @xmath21 ) spin dimers represented by bosonic degrees of freedom . in applying this technique to the finite field case",
    "we will largely use the same or similar notations as in the previous zero field case @xcite for consistency .",
    "before we perform the transformation to bosonic variables it is useful to have a clear understanding of the local singlet-triplet level scheme as function of anisotropy and magnetic field because certain tendencies of the quantum critical behaviour are correlated with the splitting of the ground state and the first excited state of a local bond .",

    "although there is no mapping or exact equivalence of the two models the agreement of their qualitative features by simply identifying the intersite interaction ( kn ) and hopping ( kl ) energies ( both given by t ) is generally quite good . as discussed in @xcite the 1d kondo necklace model does not exhibit quantum critical behaviour , this agrees with earlier numerical work on the kl model @xcite where the disordered spin gapped state always prevails @xcite .",
    "+ we discuss the more interesting 2d case where quantum phase transitions in the kn model are possible @xcite .",
    "one can compare the values of the quantum critical t@xmath0/j ( we set j@xmath200 j@xmath10 in this section to comply with literature conventions ) obtained for the kn model from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with those for the kl model obtained in mc simulations obtained previously @xcite . in the spirit of doniach s replacement in 1d we should compare with the kn model for xy - type interactions , i.e. with the @xmath201 case in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] which has a t@xmath0/j=0.7 .",
    "the mc simulations for the 2d su(2 ) fermionic kl model lead to quantum critical parameters ( average values ) t@xmath0/j= 0.71 @xcite , 0.69 @xcite and 0.68 @xcite , very close to the appropriate value in fig .  [ fig3 ] ( upper panel : center of full line ; lower panel : left corner of full line ) . note that the critical t@xmath0 s corresponding to full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are obtained from a simple analytical formula within the bond - operator mean field approach @xcite .",
    "further support for this scenario comes from exact diagonalisation ( ed ) results for the kl model on small clusters @xcite using open boundary conditions .",
    "the total average local moment @xmath202 calculated as function of j / t shows a reduction to half of the free moment size due to kondo singlet formation in the lattice for the value t@xmath0/j = 0.67 . if it is interpreted as the critical value in the thermodynamic limit this is again close to the above results .",
    "this near equality of analytical kn and numerical kl results seems to suggest that even in 2d the su(2 ) kl model is better described by the u(1 ) xy - type kn model with ( @xmath44)=(0,1 ) since the su(2 ) kn model with ( @xmath44)=(1,1 ) has a considerably larger critical value @xmath203 .",
    "+ the fermionic kl model is obtained from the periodic anderson model ( pam ) by a schrieffer - wolff transformation which eliminates charge fluctuations of f - electrons .",
    "the resulting kondo coupling j is then given in terms of the anderson model parameters by @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the f - level position with respect to the fermi level at zero energy , u is the on - site f - electron repulsion and v their hybridisation strength with conduction electrons .",
    "the periodic anderson model may be studied with the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite .",
    "this method has been used more recently to investigate its quantum critical properties @xcite which should be related to those of the kondo lattice and hence also kn models .",
    "the method is formally a d=@xmath42 approximation but has nevertheless been used for studying electron correlations in finite dimensional lattices such as the 3d pam in @xcite . using the value of j from the schrieffer - wolff transformation the extrapolated t=",
    "0 phase diagram suggests that the critical hopping strength at the qcp is given by @xmath206 .",
    "this is again in reasonable agreement with the mean - field bond operator result for the 3d kn model which predicts @xmath207 @xcite .",
    "+ while the quantum critical behaviour as function of control parameter t / j is well presented , there are few microscopic investigations concerning the field induced quantum critical behaviour of kl / kn type models such as provided here .",
    "the fermionic 2d kl model in an external field with equal g - factors corresponding to ( g@xmath19,g@xmath18 ) = ( 2,2 ) was studied in ref . by using variational and mc methods .",
    "the numerical results for j / t =3 suggest that the transition between kondo and af ordered regime takes place in a field region ( b@xmath208 in notation of ref .  ) between b@xmath209/t = 1.0 and n b@xmath210/t = 2.25 .",
    "in this regime both kondo - like features and transverse magnetic order coexist . from the present calculations of the 2d kn model again with ( @xmath44)=(0,1 ) , g - factors as above and using the data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3],[fig5 ] one obtains b@xmath0/t = 1.86 ( b@xmath0/j=0.62 ) which is close to the average 1.63 of the above b@xmath211 values . this value for the critical field",
    "was also confirmed by exact diagonalisation ( ed ) results for the kl model on small clusters @xcite where the breaking up of on - site singlet formation was observed above the value b@xmath0/j @xmath212 .",
    "we conclude that kl and kn models also seem to exhibit similar field induced quantum critical behaviour . another matter is the scaling behaviour of singlet gap and staggered magnetisation around the critical field .",
    "the present mean field type theory does not give sufficient insight into that issue .",
    "it has sofar been treated within continuum field theories involving order parameter fluctuations around the critical field @xcite . + the present bond operator mean field results for the kn model are apparently consistent with known numerical results for the fermionic kondo lattice models .",
    "it is less clear whether they are useful for the interpretation of experimental results , especially for the field induced quantum phase transitions . since charge degrees of freedoms are eliminated in the kn model it is strictly speaking more appropriate for the kondo - insulator compounds which have a hybridisation gap due to half filled conduction bands .",
    "however we ignore this subtlety in the following and also apply it to the magnetism of metallic kondo compounds . the zero field quantum critical behaviour as function of the control parameter",
    "t / j can experimentally be mimicked by applying hydrostatic or chemical pressure ( by substitution of elements ) .",
    "this changes mostly the hybridisation and hence the kondo coupling j. in the accessible pressure regime one may assume that t / j varies linearly with pressure . in this manner",
    "it is feasible to drive af ordered heavy fermion systems to the quantum critical point where they become nonmagnetic heavy fermi liquids .",
    "since hydrostatic ( positive ) pressure generally increases j it tends to suppress the af phase while with suitable substitution of elements ( negative ) chemical pressure may decrease j which favors af order . thus the af qcp may be approached from both sides .",
    "there are many examples to be found especially among ce- compounds , for a review see @xcite . in most cases of ce - compounds , however , the af qcp may not be reached directly because it is enveloped by a dome of the superconducting phase and the critical pressure has to be obtained from extrapolation to t=0 . while the kl / kn type models discussed above naturally suggest the af qcp there is no direct way of experimental determination of the critical ( t / j)@xmath0 since its relation to the experimentally accessible critical pressure p@xmath0 ( or critical concentration of substituent ) is unknown .",
    "in fact most of the interest on pressure induced qcp s focuses more on the scaling exponents of various quantities with respect to the distance ( p - p@xmath0 ) to the qcp .",
    "this is extensively discussed in the reviews cited in the introduction .",
    "+ for the field induced quantum phase transition much less experimental results are available .",
    "a review of materials investigated is given in ref . .",
    "a recent example of a field induced destruction of af order is the tetragonal ybrh@xmath41si@xmath41 compound @xcite . at ambient pressure and zero field",
    "it has an af order which is indeed of the easy plane ( xy)-interaction type ( @xmath12=0 ) .",
    "the af order is destroyed at 0.66 t for field along the hard c - axis and a nonmagnetic fermi liquid state appears above the critical field . if one assumes that the local kondo interaction which results from the schrieffer - wolff mechanism is more of the isotropic nature ( @xmath8=1 ) it qualitatively corresponds to the af - ks scenario shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . as mentioned before the reentrant scenario shown also in this figure exists only in a narrow parameter range and it is perhaps understandable that no such example is known .",
    "what is really surprising is the following observation : most of the parameter cases in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] would predict the ks - af sequence , i.e. the field - induced af order out of the kondo phase .",
    "this is a natural consequence that in most cases a field reduces the singlet - triplet gap and supports the onset of magnetic order as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "we would like to stress that this is also the only phase sequence found in the fermionic kl model @xcite .",
    "however field induced af magnetic order is not easily found in heay fermion compounds .",
    "for example ceni@xmath41ge@xmath41 at ambient pressure and zero field is in the kondo singlet phase and rather close to the af quantum phase transition which may be achieved by appropriate substitution of ni .",
    "thus it is a complementary case to ybrh@xmath41si@xmath41 .",
    "however in an external field there is no field induced transition to transverse af order as one might naively expect from the model discussion , rather it is driven further away from the af qcp as specific heat and resistivity measurements suggest @xcite .",
    "there is however one known example of a heavy fermion system which exhibits field induced af order , though complicated by the appearance of superconductivity .",
    "the compound cerhin@xmath213 is already an af at ambient pressure @xcite .",
    "application of hydrostatic pressure moves it to the nonmagnetic ( ks ) side where it also becomes superconducting .",
    "additional application of a magnetic field destroys the superconductivity and leads to the reestablishment of a field induced af order in a wide range of pressure form 1.4 to 2.4 gpa @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the ks - af sequence of phases corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( top ) which appears in the majority of cases studied here .",
    "experimentally , however , it seems to be the one most rarely encountered .",
    "+ these examples suggest that while the kondo lattice or necklace type models have some qualitative and instructive properties which are relevant for magnetic quantum phase transitions they may not be able to explain some experimental observations in heavy fermion compounds .",
    "it is well possible that the complete elimination of charge degrees of freedom is too radical by suppressing hybridisation effects of moments with conduction electrons and thus favoring the magnetic phases .",
    "therefore the more fundamental pam model , including appropriate local and conduction electron zeeman terms may be a more promising starting point for future investigations of field induced quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion compounds .",
    "in this work we have investigated the general anisotropic kondo necklace model and its quantum phase transition from paramagnetic singlet phase to af phase and vice versa in an external field .",
    "we have derived a bosonic hamiltonian using the bond operator representation of local and interacting spins and diagonalised the bilinear part by a generalised bogoliubov transformation to circular polarised modes to include the effect of the external field .",
    "higher order parts of the hamiltonian were found to be insignificant for the quantum critical behaviour . in mean field approximation one",
    "obtains a total ground state energy that depends on the singlet amplitude @xmath65 , staggered and uniform triplet amplitudes @xmath214 and the chemical potential .",
    "minimization leads to two sets of selfconsistent equations for kondo singlet and af phase , respectively .    from their numerical solution",
    "we find that in most investigated cases the t@xmath0 value of the quantum critical point decreases monotonously with field strength leading to the kn - af phase sequence for increasing field . in the case of unequal g - factors and ( @xmath8,@xmath12 )",
    "= ( 1,1 ) it levels off at a plateau value t@xmath195/t@xmath215 0.4 while for ( @xmath8,@xmath12 ) = ( 0,0 ) it continues to decrease at larger field .",
    "however for the genuine kn case with ( @xmath8,@xmath12 ) = ( 1,0 ) the t@xmath0(h ) curve is nonmonotonic with a minimum at @xmath216 0.275 at small fields and continues to increase for larger fields .",
    "depending on the size of t this implies two possibilities : for above critical t a suppression of af and the opening of a spin excitation gap for @xmath217 ( af - kn sequence ) or the reentrance behaviour ( kn - af - kn sequence ) of the gapped singlet phase for slightly subcritical t ( as compared to t@xmath0(0 ) ) . for equal g - factors",
    "a crossing of local levels occurs due to a conserved s@xmath67 and the critical t@xmath0 reaches zero already at relatively small fields for all investigated cases of ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "since our treatment is of mean - field type we will get mean - field exponents for the spin gap e@xmath84 and magnetisation m@xmath19 at the field - induced qcp .",
    "this is apparent from fig.[fig4 ] and has not been discussed further .",
    "improvement for the critical exponents will require a selfconsistent renormalisation theory for the triplet excitations close to the quantum critical point .",
