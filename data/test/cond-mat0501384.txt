    "attractors for dynamical systems are traditionally viewed as being asymptotically stable invariant sets which have a neighbourhood that absorbs all sufficiently close initial conditions . as a consequence",
    "the basins of such attractors contain open sets .",
    "whereas this concept works very well for simple attractors of ordinary differential equations , for more complicated attractors the smallest asymptotically stable attractor may contain much more than the asymptotic dynamics of ` typical ' initial conditions .",
    "partly in response to this problem , milnor introduced a concept of measure attractor ( now usually called _ milnor attractor _ ) @xcite .",
    "this is a compact invariant set whose basins of attraction has positive measure in phase space .",
    "examples of riddled basins @xcite show that , even for smooth invertible dynamics , one can find milnor attractors with riddled basins ; i.e. such that any open set that intersects the basin has positive measure in the basin of a different attractor ; see @xcite for a recent review of riddled basins .    in the absence of smoothness or invertibility , it is clear that more exotic attractors may appear .",
    "recent work @xcite",
    "on globally coupled networks of oscillator with delayed pulse interactions @xcite indicates that extreme cases of riddled basin attractors , _ unstable attractors _ , can appear , where there is a neighbourhood @xmath1 of the attractor such that almost all points exit from @xmath1 under the dynamics .",
    "even more surprisingly , numerical simulations @xcite seem to indicate that these attractors can appear in a robust way as long as there are sufficiently many oscillators in the system .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to give a rigorous explanation for the appearance and robustness of unstable attractors in such systems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ secunstableatts ] examines the general problem of unstable attractors in a systematic way .",
    "we give some necessary conditions for the appearance of unstable attractors and some motivating examples .",
    "subsequently , we address the relationship between networks of unstable attractors and robust heteroclinic cycles , and present a simple recipe of how to perturb a smooth flow with a robust heteroclinic cycle to a smooth semiflow with a network of unstable attractors .",
    "in section  [ secpulsecos ] we consider the system of globally pulse coupled oscillators with delayed interactions studied in @xcite , including a generalization of the set of possible response functions .",
    "because the system combines continuous time evolution with discrete time events , it is strictly speaking a hybrid system @xcite with delay .",
    "the main result of this section is theorem  [ thmfinite ] which shows that the dynamics reduces , after a finite time , to a finite dimensional hybrid system .",
    "it gives an explicit upper bound on the number of remaining dimensions in the system .",
    "in section  [ secuasforpulsecos ] we prove that the system discussed in section  [ secpulsecos ] exhibits unstable attractors ( theorem  [ thm : uasexist ] ) and that these persist for an open set of parameter values ( theorem  [ thm : uasrobust ] ) .",
    "the proof has two parts ; firstly we show ( by following an appropriate open set of initial conditions ) that a certain periodic orbit is a milnor attractor ; secondly we show that this orbit is a saddle .",
    "we discuss this mechanism as being an effect of ` dimension jump ' in the system .",
    "section  [ secdiscuss ] discusses obstacles to proving the existence and robustness of unstable attractors in a more general setting . for convenience some of the details of the proofs have been placed in appendices : appendix  [ app : k=1 ] describes the system in the case that the delay is short enough that only one delayed pulse can influence the future dynamics of the system .",
