    "instability of an unstable d - brane or a pair of d - brane - anti - d - brane is manifested by a tachyonic mode and , in the context of effective field theory , decay of the unstable brane is depicted by condensation of tachyon  @xcite . as the tachyon approaches its true vacuum where brane tension is dissipated away ,",
    "open string degrees of freedom disappear and correspondingly perturbative plane - wave type excitations are completely absent in the effective field theory .",
    "the classical decay process is described by the so - called rolling tachyons which are constructed as a family of spatially - homogeneous but time - dependent classical solutions in open string theory  @xcite .",
    "this rolling tachyon has been mainly applied to various topics in cosmology in the very early universe , e.g. , inflation , dark matter , and reheating  @xcite . in tachyon cosmology or other applications , inclusion of bosonic string degrees",
    "looks indispensable , e.g. , gauge field , graviton , dilaton , antisymmetric tensor field , or rr - field . in relation with string dynamics ,",
    "u(1 ) gauge field on the brane has played an important role  @xcite , of which dynamics is given by born - infeld type gauge kinetic term in the effective action on the brane  @xcite since one of two u(1 ) gauge symmetries remains unbroken in the decaying d@xmath4-system despite of tachyon condensation  @xcite .",
    "in pure rolling tachyon background , perturbative electromagnetic waves stop propagating around the tachyon vacuum as expected  @xcite . in the presence of both the rolling tachyon and a uniform electric field",
    ", there exists a critical value of the uniform electric field and perturbative waves on it propagate along electric flux lines , of which speed is given by magnitude of the background electric field  @xcite .",
    "though final remnants after decaying may be composed of uniformly stretched fundamental strings ( f1 s ) and tachyon matter , dynamical process including confinement is not understood yet .    an intriguing question worth asking at the present stage is to look for general homogeneous configuration of the effective field theory of the tachyon with a runaway potential and born - infeld type u(1 ) gauge field , and to study properties of perturbative excitations on such background . for the system of unstable d3-brane",
    ", we showed that the most general homogeneous solution is the time - dependent rolling tachyon with constant electric and magnetic fields . under a reasonable shape of the runaway tachyon potential",
    ", we find an exact form of the classical rolling tachyon solution , which may make further study more tractable in the scheme of effective field theory .",
    "a family of tachyonic vacua constructed at infinite vacuum expectation value of the tachyon is characterized by magnitude of the constant background electric and magnetic fields @xmath5 and the angle @xmath6 between them .",
    "the configuration has nonvanishing momentum along the direction perpendicular to @xmath7 and @xmath8 . by an appropriate lorentz boost and a rotation",
    "we show that it is a pressureless fluid of fundamental strings made by turning on electric and magnetic fields and stretched along one direction in the rolling tachyon background , which will be called string fluid with electric and magnetic fields .",
    "there is however a subtle point .",
    "since the momentum density is nonvanishing in the frame that fields are homogeneous , it is not the rest frame of the whole configuration . in the rest frame obtained by a suitable lorentz boost ,",
    "the tachyon field is no longer homogeneous in the sense that @xmath9 is not zero . in other words , the rest frame of the system and the frame where the tachyon field is homogeneous are different",
    "this fact makes the configuration rather nontrivial and in general the electric field and the magnetic field are not completely ( anti-)parallel though they form fluid of strings stretched along one direction .",
    "the angle @xmath6 between them may then be interpreted as encoding the relative motion between stretched strings along one direction and the rolling tachyon flowing in the perpendicular direction to the strings .    in order to reach the above interpretation we investigate the small fluctuations around the homogeneous configuration of the rolling tachyon and the electromagnetic fields @xmath10 . after a lorentz boost and a rotation ,",
    "the fluctuations are shown to propagate along the direction of the electric field with the propagation velocity equal to the electric field . roughly , the whole situation in this frame is then as follows .",
    "the tachyon has a nonzero momentum since it is lorentz boosted ; the electric field and the magnetic field still make a nonzero angle and have their own momentum .",
    "then these two contributions cancel each other , making the total momentum zero .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the fact that the only nonzero components of the energy - momentum tensor are @xmath11 and the diagonal component along the direction of the electric field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", the most general homogeneous solution of rolling tachyon with constant electric and magnetic field is obtained . in section 3 ,",
    "propagation of small fluctuations on the obtained configuration is analyzed .",
    "then via a suitable lorentz boost and a rotation , we identify the background configuration as a fluid of strings with electric and magnetic fields stretched along the direction of electric field and rolling tachyon . in section 4 ,",
    "we conclude with discussion . finally in appendix",
    ", detailed description of perturbative electromagnetic waves is given in the pure tachyon background .",
    "in this section we introduce the system of tachyon coupled to an abelian gauge field and find the most general homogeneous solution which turns out to be constant electric and magnetic fields together with rolling tachyon configuration .",

    "to find more detailed behavior of the solution , we need to know the explicit form of @xmath211 . with the tachyon potential ( [ v3 ] ) and the tachyon background ( [ ts ] ) , it becomes @xmath212 in this case we solved eq .",
    "( [ beq ] ) numerically and the result is shown in fig .",
    "note that the electric field goes to a constant value , while the magnetic field linearly diverges .",
    "also both @xmath213 and @xmath214 vanish after some time , which means that electromagnetic wave freezes and does not propagate after the tachyon rolling .",
    "in addition , one can see from the last figure of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that waves with short wavelengths are frozen earlier than those with long wavelengths .",
    "finally @xmath213 tends to vanish faster than @xmath214 , i.e. , the electric field is frozen more quickly than the magnetic field .",
    "this is because @xmath213 in ( [ espeed ] ) contains extra @xmath215 compared with @xmath214 in eq .",
    "( [ bspeed ] ) .    for the onset behavior",

    "this can be confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "at late time , the value of the potential ( [ vtt ] ) decays exponentially to zero @xmath226 so that eq .",

    "therefore @xmath193 increases linearly in time and then the propagation speed decreases according to eq .",
    "( [ bspeed ] ) ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath232 linearly increases , our linear approximation of the equation of motion is not valid as @xmath233 becomes large .",

    "( [ e - b1 ] ) . of course",
