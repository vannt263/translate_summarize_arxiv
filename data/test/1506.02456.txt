    "problems of the percolation theory are widely used both in fundamental physics  @xcite and in applications .",
    "the fundamental interest in the percolation theory is associated with studies of the conformal field theory , probability theory , statistical physics , and theory of random graphs  @xcite . in applied problems , models of the percolation theory",
    "are used to describe granulated and composite materials  @xcite , propagation of illnesses  @xcite , and reliability of networks  @xcite .",
    "models of the percolation theory are the main models for the description of processes in structurally disordered porous media filled with liquids and gases  @xcite .",
    "the states and properties of such systems have been actively studied in recent years  @xcite .",
    "phenomena beyond the traditional notions were detected for such systems .",
    "in particular , the disordered system of pores of a porous medium filled with a nonwetting liquid can undergo a dispersion transition , when the nonwetting liquid transits to an effectively < < wetting > > state at the variation of the temperature and degree of filling of the porous medium  @xcite .",
    "the state of such a system can be nonergodic with an anomalously slow relaxation of nonequilibrium states  @xcite .",
    "a physical reason for the dispersion transition is the appearance of the collective < < multiparticle > > interaction of liquid nanoclusters in neighboring pores with various sizes  @xcite owing to the formation of the ground state in the form of the percolation cluster of liquid - filled pores inside the percolation cluster of empty pores of the porous medium .",
    "the relaxation of the system is a process of its successive transition through the local maxima of the energy of local configurations of clusters of empty and filled pores and depends on the degeneracy of the ground state  @xcite , which is determined by the percolation cluster of filled pores .",
    "it is known that continuum percolation models  @xcite are used to describe the behavior of a liquid under the confinement conditions in disordered porous media .",
    "for this reason , the problem of the universality and properties of the percolation cluster in the case of continuum percolation arises , including the problem of the degeneracy of the percolation cluster in this case .",
    "we note that similar problems of the universality of various characteristics in two - dimensional percolation theory were previously studied both analytically and numerically  @xcite for a sphere  @xcite , a torus  @xcite , and a mbius strip  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the problem of the possible degeneracy of the percolation cluster in the case of continuum percolation is solved by the numerical monte carlo simulation . to this end , we calculate the wrapping probability @xmath0 in the two - dimensional problem of percolation on a klein bottle and compare with the results of the known calculation of percolation on the torus  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the percolation thresholds and scaling exponents for the torus and klein bottle coincide with each other , whereas the quantities @xmath0 are significantly different",
    ". the last circumstance can be due to the degeneracy of the percolation cluster on one or both surfaces .",
    "the monte carlo calculations were performed on square systems of various sizes with the newman ",
    "ziff algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is currently the fastest algorithm of the search for the percolation threshold and ensures the calculation time proportional to the number of objects in a system ( e.g. , the calculation time in the hoshen ",
    "kopelman algorithm  @xcite is proportional to the _ square _ of the number of objects in the system ) .",
    "the main idea of the algorithm is that objects are added to the system one - by - one ; after that , the conditions of the overlapping of an added object with already existing objects are verified , objects are joined into clusters , and , finally , percolation conditions are verified .",
    "the linear dependence on the number of objects is reached owing to the use of the _ union find with path compression _",
    "algorithm  @xcite for the joining of clusters .    in this work ,",
    "completely permeable disks with the unit diameter @xmath1 are used as objects . according to the newman ",
    "ziff algorithm , the following actions are performed in each calculation iteration :    1 .   the addition of a disk to the system .",
    "2 .   the test of the conditions of overlapping of the added disk with the disks already existing in the system and joining of disks into clusters . 3 .   the test of the percolation conditions .",
    "the addition of a disk to the system is reduced to the generation of two random numbers determining the position of its center .",
    "the random numbers were generated according to the mersenne ",
    "twister algorithm having a period of @xmath2 .",
    "the test of the conditions of overlapping of the added disk with the disks already existing in the system is complicated because the number of neighbors of the disk in the case of continuum percolation is unknown . in order to ensure the effective operation of the algorithm",
    ", we used an approach proposed in  @xcite ; the essence of this approach is as follows .",
    "the calculation domain ( a square with a certain size ) is divided into squares with a side equal to the diameter of a disk , i.e. , with a unit side .",
    "a disk located in a certain cell can overlap only with disks located in the same cell or in eight cells surrounding the given cell .",
    "thus , the condition of overlapping is verified only for disks in the given cell and eight neighboring cells .",
    "disks are joined into clusters according to the newman ",
    "ziff algorithm  @xcite .",
    "for the subsequent test of the percolation conditions , the shifts over two axes from the given disk to the root disk of the cluster are calculated in the process of joining .",
    "this path is formally a floating - point number , but it is easier to use the method proposed in  @xcite and to calculate the path from the square cell containing the disk to the cell of the root disk , rather than the path from the disk to the root of the cluster .",
    "this method allows using integers in the calculation of the path and in the test of the percolation conditions .",
    "particular attention should be paid to the formulation of boundary conditions , because they determine the topology of the surface on which the calculation is performed .",
    "the standard periodic boundary conditions correspond to percolation on the torus : the points of the boundaries in the vertical and horizontal directions are identified as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bc ] on the left .",
    "this corresponds to the < < gluing > > of a square sheet providing the torus . the gluing according to fig .  [",
    "fig : bc ] on the right provides the klein bottle . in terms of boundary conditions",
    ", this means that points on the upper and lower sides of the square are identified in the < < mirror > > manner , which creates additional difficulties for the test of the percolation conditions .    in order to verify the percolation conditions in each of the directions",
    ", we used the method proposed in  @xcite adapted for continuum percolation  @xcite ; the essence of this method is as follows .",
    "each addition of a new disk to the system is accompanied by the procedure of joining of clusters .",
    "if the added disk ( disk 1 ) overlaps with another disk ( disk 2 ) and both disks belong to one cluster , there are two paths to their common root disk : through disk 1 and through disk 2",
    ". if the sum of these paths in each of the directions is no more than unity , percolation does not occur .",
    "if the sum of these paths in a certain direction is larger than or equal to the size of the system in this direction , the wrapping cluster in this direction appears",
    ".    however , it is noteworthy that the described method can be used to verify the percolation conditions only in the case of periodic boundary conditions and percolation on the torus .",
    "this method is inapplicable to the klein bottle because gluing in one of the directions is mirror and the path to the root disk at the transition through the corresponding boundary can change by a value different from @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this difficulty is overcome as follows . instead of the calculation in the square calculation domain with the size @xmath5",
    ", we performed the calculation in a rectangular calculation domain with a vertical size of @xmath6 and a horizontal size of @xmath5 , i.e. , in a rectangle consisting of two squares in the vertical axis .",
    "when adding a new disk , two random numbers @xmath7 , @xmath8 were generated in the interval @xmath9 , the disk was added to the lower square of the calculation domain , clusters were joined , and percolation conditions were verified . after that , a < < copy > > of this disk was added to the upper square with allowance for mirror reflection in the vertical axis , i.e. , with the coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; then , clusters were joined , and the percolation conditions in the axes were verified .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] exemplifies the used square calculation domain for the size @xmath12 .",
    "digits and blue color mark disks in the lower square , whereas primed digits and red color indicate their reflections in the upper square with allowance for mirror reflection in the vertical axis .",
    "the use of the rectangular calculation domain increases the calculation time with the algorithm as compared to the calculation in the square calculation domain , but eliminates the problem of verifying the percolation conditions , because the rectangular calculation domain has periodic boundary conditions in both axes and makes it possible to applied a method based on the summation of paths to the root disk .",
    "if each calculation ends at the number of disks @xmath13 that results in the first appearance of the wrapping cluster , the probability of the existence of the wrapping cluster in the canonical ensemble @xmath14 is equal to the fraction of the calculations ending at the number of disks no more than @xmath13 .",
    "the wrapping probability @xmath15 in the grand canonical ensemble is a function of the dimensionless concentration ( degree of filling ) @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the area of one disk ) and is obtained by the convolution of the probability @xmath18 with the poisson distribution with the mean value @xmath19",
    "@xcite : @xmath20    at a fixed size of the system @xmath5 , each calculation was performed until percolation occurred in both axes and the number of disks resulting in the first appearance of the wrapping cluster in each of the axes was fixed .",
    "using these data and relation  , we calculated six different probabilities @xmath15 of the appearance of the wrapping cluster :    1 .   in any of the axes @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   in both axes",
    "simultaneously @xmath22 .",
    "3 .   in the horizontal axis",
    "@xmath23 independently of the presence of a cluster in the vertical axis .",
    "4 .   in the vertical axis @xmath24 independently of the presence of a cluster in horizontal axis . 5 .   in the vertical axis , but not in the horizontal axis",
    "6 .   in the horizontal axis , but not in the vertical axis @xmath26 .",
    "it is worth noting that the vertical and horizontal axes are not equivalent in contrast to percolation on the torus .",
    "consequently , in the general case , the probabilities are not equal to each other : @xmath27 and @xmath28 . at the same time , only three of six probabilities are independent because of the obvious relations @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31    the main problem in the simulation of percolation processes is the calculation of the percolation threshold @xmath32 .",
    "the simulation of percolation on the klein bottle is complicated because the asymptotic values of the probabilities @xmath0 are unknown in contrast to percolation on the torus . as a result",
    ", the relation @xmath33 can not be used to determine the dependence @xmath34 , which approaches @xmath32 in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "a method for the determination of the percolation threshold @xmath32 based on a nonmonotonic behavior of the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the positions of the maxima of the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 should approach the percolation threshold @xmath32 with an increase in the size of the system @xmath35 . some other authors  @xcite use the expression @xmath36 to calculate the critical concentration at a given @xmath5 value .",
    "the sequence of critical concentrations @xmath37 thus obtained should converge to the percolation threshold in the limit @xmath35 . in this work , we used both methods to estimate the critical concentration .    to test the proposed simulation method",
    ", we calculated continuum percolation on the torus with the use of the reflection of the disk placed in the lower square to the upper square . in this calculation , in order to obtain the torus after gluing , reflection in the vertical axis of the disk in the upper square was not performed .",
    "the resulting critical concentration @xmath32 and probabilities of the percolation transition @xmath0 are very close to the results of work  @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed for 21 sizes of systems in the range from @xmath38 to @xmath39 . for each size , we performed @xmath40 computer experiments : @xmath41 for sizes @xmath42 , @xmath43 for sizes @xmath44 , @xmath45 for sizes @xmath46 , and @xmath47 for sizes @xmath48 . wrapping probabilities @xmath49 for some sizes from @xmath38 to @xmath39",

    "it is seen that @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rl]a , b ) and @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rl]e , f ) because of the aforementioned nonequivalence of the vertical and horizontal axes in the case of the klein bottle .",
    "since the percolation threshold @xmath32 for percolation on the klein bottle is unknown , this threshold was calculated with the use of the dependences @xmath15 . in order to determine @xmath32",
    ", we obtained the dependence of the critical concentration on the size of the system @xmath34 , which approaches the percolation threshold in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 was determined by two methods : from the position of the maximum of @xmath52 and @xmath53 and from relation  .",
    "the rate of convergence @xmath37 to the percolation threshold @xmath32 is determined by two factors : the characteristic width of the percolation transition region and the rate of convergence of the transition probability @xmath15 to its asymptotic value @xmath0 .",
    "the characteristic size of the transition region depends on the size of the system as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the universal critical exponent for two - dimensional percolation .",
    "our calculations show that , in the case of percolation on the klein bottle , the characteristic size of the percolation transition region , which is determined by the derivative @xmath56 , decreases really with an increase in @xmath5 as @xmath57 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdiff ] , where @xmath58 is plotted together with the straight line @xmath59 .",

    "the rate of convergence of the probability of the percolation transition @xmath15 to @xmath63 is determined by the boundary conditions  @xcite and for percolation on the torus depends on @xmath5 as @xmath64 .",
    "it will be shown below that the dependence @xmath64",
    "@xcite is also valid for percolation on the klein bottle .",
    "thus , the rate of convergence of the critical concentration @xmath37 to the percolation threshold @xmath32 in the case of percolation on the klein bottle is determined by the dependence @xmath65 .",
    "the semi - log plots of the critical concentrations @xmath34 derived from the maxima of @xmath53 ( open diamonds ) , @xmath52 ( closed diamonds ) and from   for four probabilities : @xmath21 ( upward pointing triangles ) , @xmath22 ( circles ) , @xmath23 ( squares ) , and @xmath24 ( downward pointing triangles ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pc ] .",
    "it is seen that all dependences with an increase in the size approach the same value .",
    "the percolation threshold obtained in this work is @xmath66 , which almost coincides with the percolation threshold in the case of continuum percolation of permeable disks on the torus  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the percolation threshold @xmath32 is independent of the topology of the surface and is a topological invariant .",
    "the situation with the asymptotic probabilities of the percolation transition @xmath0 is different .",
    "these probabilities for percolation on the torus were calculated in  @xcite from the conformal field theory and were confirmed in the numerical calculations  @xcite for continuum and lattice percolation : @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 these relations are invalid for percolation on the klein bottle",
