    "the search for the exotic states ( tetraquarks , hybrids , hadronic molecules , etc ) in the observed hadron spectrum has been a subject of both theoretical and experimental investigations for decades .",
    "the exact pattern , how these states emerge , should be strictly determined by the underlying theory and should therefore contain important information about the behavior of qcd at low energies . in practice , however , extracting such information from the data encounters certain challenges , which are in part of a conceptual nature . in the present paper we wish to focus exactly on this issue .",
    "in general , a state is called `` exotic '' if its quark content does not correspond to the `` standard '' constellation given by the non - relativistic quark model ( @xmath2 for mesons and @xmath3 for baryons ) .",
    "consequently , one needs to use a particular model as a reference point to define how the exotic states are meant ( note that the very notion of constituent quarks is , strictly speaking , model - dependent ) .",
    "putting it differently , one has to _ agree _ on certain _ criteria _ formulated in terms of certain hadronic _ observables _ :",
    "if these observables are measured , or calculated on the lattice , and the results do not follow the pattern predicted by the quark model , this then should be interpreted as a signature for exotica .",
    "a standard example for the exotic state candidates is given by the scalar nonet with the masses around 1  gev .",
    "as it is well known , the observed mass hierarchy in this nonet is reversed as compared to , e.g. , the pseudoscalar or vector multiplets .",
    "such a mass ordering is counter - intuitive from the point of view of the naive quark model , but can be easily understood , if the scalar mesons were interpreted as tetraquark states ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is , however , not the only possible interpretation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 were considered as hadronic molecules , whereas in refs .",
    "@xcite these states were described as a combination of a bare pole and the rescattering contribution . in the jlich meson - exchange model",
    ", the @xmath5 appears to be a bound @xmath6 state , whereas the @xmath4 is a dynamically generated threshold effect @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were inferred in ref .",
    "@xcite from the calculations in the unitarized chpt with explicit resonance states .",
    "finally , the investigations carried out within the framework of qcd sum rules are also indicative of the non-@xmath2 nature of @xmath4  @xcite . given these multiple interpretations , it is natural to look for the clear - cut criteria based on the _ observables _ in order to minimize the _ model - dependence _ of the statements about the nature of the hadronic states in question .",
    "in fact , such criteria are known for quite some time already .",
    "the `` pole counting '' method , considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , relates the number of the @xmath7-matrix poles near threshold to the molecular nature of the states corresponding to these poles .",
    "namely , it has been argued that the loosely bound states of hadrons ( hadronic molecules ) correspond to a single pole , whereas the poles corresponding to the tightly bound quark states ( of standard or exotic nature ) always come in pairs .",
    "a closely related criterion goes under the name of weinberg s compositeness condition  @xcite , which uses the quantity called the wave function renormalization constant @xmath0 , where @xmath8 , to differentiate between the loosely bound states and tight qcd composites , the values @xmath9 corresponding to the molecular states and _ vice versa . _",
    "the application of these methods for the analysis of the data on scalar mesons are considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the recent review on the subject may be found in ref .",
    "moreover , _ theoretically , _ one may study the dependence of the pole positions on the number of the colors @xmath10 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) or the quark masses ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) . from the above studies",
    ", one can judge about the precise structure of these states beyond the simple alternative between a molecule and a tight quark composite .",
    "recent years have seen a renewed interest in the field , which is partly related to the progress in the lattice calculations of the qcd spectrum at the quark masses close to the physical values .",
    "it should be realized that the lattice studies have powerful tools at their disposal to analyze the nature of the states that emerge in qcd .",
    "apart from the information about the dependence of the spectrum on quark masses , a valuable information comes from the volume dependence of the calculated spectrum as well as its dependence on the twisting angle in case of twisted boundary conditions , see refs .",
    "note that all this information is obtained from the first - principle calculations on the lattice and is thus in principle devoid of any model - dependent input .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nature of the scalar states in the sector with one charm quark that is a natural generalization of our treatment of the light scalar mesons .",
    "we mainly focus on the case of the @xmath11 meson  @xcite , albeit the formalism , which we develop here , can be straightforwardly applied to the other cases where a bound state close to the elastic threshold emerges ( note that , in this paper , we do not consider the generalization of the approach to the inelastic case .",
    "this forms a subject of a separate investigation . ) .",
    "the @xmath11 does not fit very nicely to the quark - model picture , and its structure is still debated , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review . the molecular picture , due to the closeness of the @xmath1 threshold and a large coupling to the @xmath1 channel looks most promising among other alternatives",
    ". it would be highly desirable to verify this conjecture in a model - independent manner , on the basis of the lattice calculations .",
    "to this end , one may use the fact that the dependence of the bound - state energy on the kaon mass is very different for a molecule and a standard quark - model state , see ref .",
    "another possible method to address this issue has been described , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the authors propose to study the volume - dependence of the spectrum in order to apply the weinberg s compositeness criterion on the lattice .",
    "the exploratory study of light pseudoscalar mesons @xmath12 of @xmath13 in full lattice qcd has been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite . in some isospin channels",
    "the study is plagued by the presence of disconnected contributions .",
    "the implementation of the method from refs .",
    "@xcite , which implies carrying out calculations at different volumes , could be therefore quite expensive . in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative , which requires calculations at one volume , albeit with twisted boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , we show that , in the study of @xmath11 , one may use _ partially twisted _ boundary conditions , despite the fact that the quark annihilation diagrams are present .",
    "the method used in the proof is the same as in ref .",
    "generally , one may expect that the simulations with partially twisted boundary conditions could be less expensive than working at different volumes , while they provide us the same information about the nature of the bound states in question .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ compositeness ] , we briefly review weinberg s argument for the compositeness of particles . in sect .  [",
    "sec : mass - shift ] we describe the procedure of extraction of the parameter @xmath0 from the data with twisted boundary condition .",
    "further , in sect .  [ models ] we use some models and produce synthetic lattice data in order to check the procedure of the extraction in practice .",
    "the error analysis has also been carried out . separately , in sect .  [ partially ] ,",
    "we discuss the use of the partially twisted boundary conditions and show that they are equivalent to the full twisting in our case .",
    "[ conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "as mentioned before , in view of the plethora of candidates of exotic hadrons , it is very important to make model - independent statements on the nature of these states .",
    "model - independence requires that we can only study the physical observables which can be defined in terms of the matrix elements between asymptotic states .",
    "in particular , we would like to ask a question , whether a given particle , corresponding to the @xmath7-matrix pole , can be regarded as `` elementary '' or rather as a bound state ( molecule ) of other hadrons .",
    "the central place in this identification belongs to the so - called wave function renormalization constant @xmath0 , which has been used to distinguish composite particles from elementary ones since the early 1960 s  @xcite . to see its role ,",
    "we will first discuss a non - relativistic quantum mechanical system , following the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this section",
    ", we will restrict our discussion to the infinite volume .",
    "let us consider a two - body system with a hamiltonian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the free hamiltonian , and @xmath16 specifies the interaction . both @xmath17 and @xmath15 have a continuum spectrum .",
    "let us assume that there is a bound state solution of the schrdinger equation with a binding energy @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath15 also has a discrete spectrum which are the bare elementary particles . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that there is only one such state , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "in the hilbert space spanned by the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian , the completeness relation is thus given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced mass .",
    "thus , the probability for the physical state @xmath23 overlapping with the elementary state @xmath20 which , by definition , equals to @xmath0 , is given by @xmath24 ^ 2 } , \\label{eq : bb0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where eq .",
    "is used . the quantity",
    "@xmath25 then describes the probability of the physical state not being the elementary state or finding the physical state in the two - particle state . in other words",
    ", @xmath26 corresponds to a mostly elementary state whereas a state with @xmath9 can be interpreted as a predominately molecular one .    in general , the above integral depends on the matrix element @xmath27 , which is not directly measurable .",
    "however , for loosely bound states , the quantity @xmath0 can be related to the observables .",
    "consider , for instance , an s - wave bound state with a small binding energy .",
    "the binding energy should be much smaller than the inverse of the range of forces so that the matrix element @xmath27 can be approximated by a constant @xmath28 .",
    "we get from eq .",
    "@xmath29 note that , in the past , this equation has been often applied to distinguish composite particles from elementary ones , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic coupling constant @xmath30 coincides with the residue of the non - relativistic scattering matrix at the bound state pole .",
    "this can be immediately seen , considering the low equation @xmath31 in the vicinity of the pole  @xcite . here , @xmath32 .",
    "finally , we would like to relate the quantity @xmath0 to the physical observables , namely , to the scattering length @xmath33 and effective range @xmath34 . here , we are closely following the path of ref .",
    "it is important to note that these relations can be derived when the binding energy is much smaller than the inverse of the range of forces .",
    "we start with the twice - subtracted dispersion relation for the inverse of @xmath35 @xmath36 where the two subtraction constants have been determined from eq .  .",
    "the s - wave transition matrix element is related to the non - relativistic s - wave scattering amplitude @xmath37 $ ] as @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the s - wave phase shift .",
    "thus , one gets @xmath41 . inserting this into eq .",
    ", we obtain @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the characteristic distance between the constituents in the two - body bound system . comparing the above expression with the effective range expansion @xmath44 , and using eq .  , one can express the scattering length and effective range in terms of the binding energy and compositeness  @xcite @xmath45 therefore , for an s - wave shallow two - body bound state , the compositeness can be measured by measuring the low - energy scattering parameters .",
    "next , we turn to the compositeness condition within the framework of the quantum field theory . for simplicity ,",
    "let us first consider the situation when a scalar particle described by a field @xmath46 with the bare mass @xmath47 couples with two scalars @xmath48 with the masses @xmath49 .",
    "the interaction lagrangian takes the form @xmath50 .",
    "consider now the two - point function of the field @xmath46 @xmath51 summing up one - loop bubble diagrams to the two - point function , one arrives at the expression ( see fig .  [",

    "( [ eq : low ] ) . comparing now this relation with eq .  , one immediately sees that the wave function renormalization constant @xmath0 is the same as its non - relativistic counterpart and thus the compositeness condition for an s - wave bound state can be written as @xmath77 one might treat the above argumentation with a grain of salt , since it is based on certain approximations .",
    "namely , the amplitude is given as a sum of one - loop diagrams only .",
    "it is , however , clear that the result is valid beyond this approximation , if bound states close to an elastic threshold are considered .",
    "the justification is provided by the statement that such bound states can be consistently described within a non - relativistic effective field theory , which is perturbatively matched to the underlying relativistic theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on the subject ) .",
    "such an effective theory is equivalent to the non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( the number of particles is conserved ) and hence the compositeness can be rigorously defined along the lines discussed above .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the quantity @xmath0 , which is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : zrel ] ) , is ultraviolet finite , since the quantity @xmath78 is defined through the residue of the _ renormalized _ scattering amplitude .",
    "as stated above , the wave function renormalization constant , @xmath0 , gives an overlap of the physical state with the elementary state and hence could be used as a parameter that describes the compositeness of a given state .",
    "lattice calculations provide a model - independent way to determine @xmath0 from the volume dependence of the spectrum  @xcite , or  as we propose in this paper  from the dependence on the twisting angle . in this section",
    "we set up a finite - volume formalism , which describes the dependence of the bound - state mass on the volume or twisting angle .",
    "we consider elastic scattering of particles with the masses @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the s - wave .",
    "then , generally , a unitary partial - wave amplitude in infinite volume is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82[s-(m_1-m_2)^2]$ ] is the relative momentum squared in the center of mass ( c.m . ) frame .",
    "further , the function @xmath83 ( `` the inverse potential '' ) is a regular function in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "the notation used here is reminiscent of that of unitarized chiral perturbation theory , but eq .",
    "may in fact describe any elastic unitary amplitude , with the particular dynamics encoded in the function @xmath84 . the loop function @xmath85 is given by eqs .   and .",
    "this function contains a unitarity cut . across this cut",
    ", we have @xmath86 .",
    "other ( distant ) cuts that may be also present are included in @xmath84 .",
    "the loop function @xmath85 is divergent and has to be renormalized .",
    "here we do the renormalization with a subtraction constant . as it will be seen below",
    ", the extension to the finite volume is independent of any regulator .    when the particles are put in a finite box of size @xmath87 , their momenta become discretized due to boundary conditions .",
    "so , the continuum spectrum , which gives rise to the cut in the infinite volume , becomes a discrete set of two - particle levels . in order to obtain the spectrum in a finite volume",
    ", one should replace the momentum integrals by the sums over the discretized momenta in the expression of the scattering amplitude .",
    "then , the `` finite volume scattering amplitude '' @xmath88 contains poles on the real axis that correspond to the discrete two - particle levels .",
    "it should be noted that the finite - volume effects in @xmath84 are exponentially suppressed ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , so the the finite volume scattering amplitude can be obtained just by changing the loop function by its finite volume counterpart @xmath89  @xcite , where @xmath90\\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath91 denotes the integrand in eq .  , and @xmath92 the allowed momenta in a finite volume , whose value depends on the box size @xmath87 and the boundary conditions used . for the periodic boundary conditions we have @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "in case of twisted boundary conditions , the momenta also depend on the twisting angle @xmath95 according to @xmath96 . using the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite , it can be shown that @xmath97 can be related to the modified lscher function @xmath98 , see appendix  [ appendix - deltag ] , @xmath99 where @xmath100 and the dots stand for terms that are exponentially suppressed with the volume size @xmath87  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to apply lscher formalism to study shallow bound states , where the finite - volume effects are exponentially suppressed .",
    "since , for such states , the binding momentum @xmath101 is presumed to be much smaller than the lightest mass in the system , the exponentially suppressed corrections emerging , e.g. , from the potential @xmath84 could be consistently neglected as compared to the corrections @xmath102 that arise from @xmath103 .",
    "note however that , if masses of the constituents increase for a fixed binding energy , then the magnitude of the binding momentum also increases and , for the bound states of heavy mesons , may become comparable to the pion mass . in this case , further study of the problem is necessary .",
    "a recent example of such a study ( albeit in the light quark sector ) is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper",
    "this issue is not addressed .",
    "finally , note that the divergences arising at @xmath104 in eq .",
    "cancel between the sum and the integral , so we can safely send the cutoff to infinity .",
    "thus , @xmath97 does not depend on any regulator . in appendix  [ appendix - deltag ]",
    "we show in detail , how @xmath105 could be calculated below threshold for different types of boundary conditions .",
    "bound states show up in the scattering amplitude as poles on the real axis below threshold .",
    "namely , if we have a bound state with the mass @xmath60 in the infinite volume , the scattering amplitude should have a pole at @xmath106 , with the corresponding binding momentum @xmath107 , @xmath108 . from eq .",
    ", it is clear that @xmath60 and @xmath109 satisfy the equation @xmath110 = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 is the analytic continuation of @xmath112 for arbitrary complex values of @xmath113 , which is needed since the bound state is located below threshold , @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrete levels in a finite volume are obtained as the poles of the finite - volume scattering amplitude @xmath88 and , in particular , the bound state pole gets shifted to @xmath115 , with binding momentum @xmath116 , given by @xmath117 note that , below threshold , both @xmath118 and @xmath97 are real , so the pole position is real .",
    "the discrete scattering levels above threshold are real as well ( as they should be ) , since the imaginary part of @xmath97 cancels exactly with that of @xmath118 .",
    "next , we relate the finite - volume pole position with the infinite - volume quantities as the bound state mass , @xmath60 , and the coupling , @xmath119 ( defined as the residue of the scattering amplitude at the pole @xmath106 ) . to this end",
    ", we expand @xmath120 around the infinite - volume pole position , @xmath121 , @xmath122 where the prime denotes a derivative respect to @xmath113 .",
    "then , evaluating the residue at @xmath123 in eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath124 where the derivative @xmath125 is to be evaluated at @xmath106 . finally , using eqs .   and",
    ", we obtain for the pole position shift @xmath126\\ ] ] this equation gives the bound state pole position , @xmath127 ( or , equivalently , @xmath128 ) as a function of the infinite - volume parameters @xmath119 and @xmath101 .",
    "it is worth noting that , within the approximation  , the position of the bound state pole in a finite volume depends only on these two parameters .",
    "this approximation works remarkably well in all cases considered in this paper .    if the difference @xmath129 is small enough , eq .",
    "can be solved iteratively . for periodic boundary conditions , with the use of eq .",
    ", it can be shown that the lowest - order iterative solution reads @xmath130 which coincides with the result given in refs .",
    "however , it will be shown below that , for shallow bound states , where @xmath101 is very small , one should take more than just the first term in the sum  .",
    "moreover , in some cases , the iterations converge very slowly , if at all .",
    "therefore , in our opinion , it is safer to consider solving eq .   numerically , without further approximations , in order to obtain the finite volume pole position @xmath127",
    "this is the way we proceed .    using eq .",
    ", it is possible to fit the infinite - volume parameters @xmath60 and @xmath119 from the bound state levels @xmath127 , obtained through lattice simulations at different @xmath87 or @xmath95 .",
    "this , in turn , allows one to determine the compositeness parameter from eq .  .",
    "however , in actual lattice simulations , the measured energy levels have some uncertainty , and the number of different volumes or different twisting angles might be not very large .",
    "therefore , it is important to know in advance , at which accuracy should be the lattice measurements carried out , in order to render the extraction of the parameter @xmath0 reliable .",
    "we address this question in some exactly solvable models with a given @xmath84 , producing `` synthetic lattice data , '' adding random errors and trying to extract back the infinite volume parameters @xmath131 and @xmath0 from data .",
    "the potential in this model is given by a `` bare state pole '' , @xmath132 which depends on two parameters : a bare pole position @xmath133 and a bare coupling constant @xmath134 . by appropriately choosing the value of the bare parameters",

    "this model can describe a bound state with any given value of the wave function renormalization constant .",
    "next , we study the finite volume effects in the bound - state mass . in the actual calculations ,",
    "we take @xmath138 , @xmath139 and choose the mass of the bound state to be @xmath140 mev .",
    "this is a shallow bound state at 20  mev below threshold , which corresponds to a binding momentum @xmath141 mev . for the mainly molecular state",
    "we take @xmath142 , and @xmath143 is chosen for the mainly elementary one . for each of these two states",
    ", we calculate their finite - volume mass @xmath115 as the subthreshold pole position in the finite - volume scattering amplitude .    in the left panel of fig .",

    "these are obtained from the solution of the exact equation  .",
    "it is easy to see that the finite volume effects are much bigger in the case of the molecular state with @xmath142 than in the case of an elementary state with @xmath143 .",
    "this was of course expected in advance , since small finite - volume effects point on a compact nature of the state in question .",
    "here we also plot the solutions of eq .",
    ", using the known values of @xmath60 and @xmath78 , taken from the infinite volume model . in this way we can test the validity of the approximation in eq .  , used to derive eq .   from eq .  , which basically states that all relevant dynamics is encoded only in the two parameters @xmath60 and @xmath78 .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ toy - dependence ] , eq .",
    "is able to reproduce the synthetic lattice results very accurately . on the other hand , note",
    "that for shallow bound states the binding momentum @xmath101 is small , so no wonder that the expansion in @xmath97 converges rather slowly .",
    "consequently , retaining only the leading - order term and constructing iterative solution , see eq .  , might not be sufficient in all cases .    in the right panel of the same figure",
    "we show the dependence of the bound - state mass on the twisting angle @xmath144 for the fixed value of @xmath145 .",
    "we see that , for such a choice of twisting , the size of the effect of twisting for a fixed @xmath87 is almost the double of the maximal effect caused by the variation of @xmath87 from the same value to infinity ( periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "thus , using ( partially ) twisted boundary conditions to determine @xmath0 , besides being cheaper , could give more accurate results than a method based on the study of the volume - dependence of the energy level .",
    "note also that , for the above choice of the twisting angle , the twisting effect is maximal .",
    "other choices , e.g. , @xmath146 lead to a smaller effect .",
    "now we turn our attention to the realistic case of the hadronic bound state @xmath11 in the @xmath1 scattering channel with isospin @xmath147 and strangeness @xmath148 . when isospin symmetry is exact , this state is stable under strong interactions , since it does not couple to the lighter hadronic channels ( the observed decay @xmath149 breaks isospin symmetry ) .",
    "thus , the formalism above , tailored for stable bound states , does apply in this case .",
    "the case of quasi - bound states , which are coupled to inelastic channels , requires special treatment and is not addressed here .",

    "the calculation yields @xmath161 . hence , in this model",

    "next , we study this model in a finite volume and consider twisting of different quarks , from which the @xmath150 and @xmath163 mesons consist .",
    "the net effect is that these mesons get different momenta as a result of such twisting , so the expression for @xmath164 changes .",
    "note that this issue is important in view of the fact that partial twisting is allowed only for certain quarks ( see section  [ partially ] for more details ) .    in fig .",
    "[ dk - l - dependence ] , we display the volume dependence of the bound state mass for different twisting angles which are again chosen as @xmath144 . in the left panel",
    ", we plot the @xmath87-dependence for three different values of the twisting angle , when twisted boundary conditions are applied to the @xmath154-quark . in the right panel ,",
    "twisted boundary conditions are applied to the @xmath71-quark .",
    "as we shall see later , in the latter case the use of partial twisting gives the same results as using fully twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the size of the finite volume effects , using twisted boundary conditions for the @xmath165-quark , is very small , so we do not discuss this case . in this model",
    ", we test again that the predictions obtained from eq .  , using the values of @xmath60 and @xmath78 from the infinite - volume model , reproduce very well the exact solution .",
    "consequently , all relevant dynamics of the model near threshold is encoded in just two parameters @xmath78 and @xmath60 . on the other hand",
    ", we see that retaining only the leading exponential in the expansion of @xmath164 will have a large impact on the accuracy .",
    "consequently , the first few terms should be retained .",
    "we see that the convergence is satisfactory : e.g. , taking @xmath166 , where @xmath167 denotes the number of terms retained in the expansion , we see that the largest difference between the synthetic data and the prediction from eq .   is less than 0.1  mev .    analyzing fig .",
    "[ dk - l - dependence ] , we again come to the conclusion that the use of ( partially ) twisted boundary conditions can provide a better way to extract the compositeness parameter @xmath0 from lattice results",
    ". this can already be seen by comparing the curves for @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "one namely observes that the size of the effect due to twisting at a fixed volume is almost twice as big as due to changing the volume for periodic boundary conditions .    in fig .",
    "[ dk - theta - dependence ] , for three different volumes , we show the dependence of the bound - state mass on the twisting angle both for @xmath154- and @xmath71-quark twisting . on the other hand , taking the results of the @xmath170-dependence ( like in fig .  [ dk - theta - dependence ] ) at a fixed volume for granted , one could fit the value of the infinite - volume mass and coupling constant to these data , using eq .  .",
    "after this , it is straightforward to obtain the value of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , producing four synthetic lattice data points at a fixed @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( either for @xmath154- or @xmath71- quark twisting ) , we were able to obtain values for @xmath60 and @xmath78 that differ less than 1% from those calculated from the infinite volume model by fitting the solution to eq .",
    "( with @xmath173 ) to the synthetic data .",
    "real lattice simulations , however , produce results which carry uncertainties .",
    "hence , the question arises , how big these errors could be in order to be still able to determine @xmath0 with a desired accuracy .",
    "since , as seen from the figures , the finite volume effects ( for reasonable volume sizes , say , above @xmath171 ) are at most around 10 mev , one expects that a relatively high accuracy will be needed in the measurement of the bound - state energy . in order to determine , how high this accuracy should actually be",
    ", we assign an uncertainty to the synthetic data that we generate from our model .",
    "in particular , using the von neumann rejection method , from the `` exact '' data points we generate a new , `` randomized '' data set , where the central values of each data point are shifted randomly , following the gaussian distribution centered at exact data values and with a standard deviation , given by the lattice data error . repeating this process several times , we obtain several sets of synthetic lattice data with errors and central values shifted accordingly .",
    "we then fit each of the randomized data sets and obtain a corresponding value for @xmath60 and @xmath78 ( and therefore , for @xmath0 ) , one for each set , ending up with as many values for the parameters , as many randomized data sets we have generated .",
    "we can obtain then the mean and standard deviation of the distributions for @xmath60 , @xmath78 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for a given data error , we can estimate the accuracy of the parameter extraction .",
    ".the accuracy of the extraction of the parameter @xmath0 from the fits to the synthetic lattice data for different input error @xmath174 .",
    "four or eight data points and two different volumes @xmath171 and @xmath175 were used , see main text for details . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     here , we address the same problem in the context of the @xmath1 scattering . the method is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which the reader is referred for further details .",
    "consider first the scattering in the infinite volume .",
    "we start from building the channel space by tracking the quarks of different species following through the quark diagrams describing the @xmath1 scattering .",

    ". the minus sign on the diagonal of the matrix @xmath176 arises due to fermionic nature of @xmath150 and @xmath163 mesons composed of valence and ( commuting ) ghost quarks .",
    "the crucial point now is that there exist linear symmetry relations between various elements of @xmath55 due to equal valence , sea and ghost quark masses .",
    "note that scattering matrix elements are given by residues of the 4-point green functions @xmath178 of the bilinear quark operators at the poles , corresponding to the external mesonic legs .",

    "we see that the finite - volume spectrum in case of the partial twisting is determined from the lscher equation 1-g_l^(s)=0 , in the same way as in the full - twisting case .",
