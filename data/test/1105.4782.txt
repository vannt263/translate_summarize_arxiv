    "for each excitation studied we used the same criterion considered in the phenomenological approach , i.e. we controlled that the energy eigenvalues of the first low - lying states did not vary by more than 0.1 mev against the enlargement of the configuration space . in order to obtain this numerical accuracy",

    "the strategy of our investigation is analogous to that used in the previous section , i.e. we compare results obtained by using interactions with and without tensor terms . while for the hf calculations this comparison provides a clear indication of the effects of the tensor force , in the rpa case the situation is more complicated . in effect",

    "energies and wave functions provided by the hf results .",
    "we have disentangled the effects produced by these two different sources by presenting results where the tensor force is switched on and off in both hf and rpa calculations . to distinguish the results of the different type of calculations we have indicated with @xmath64 the rpa excitation energies , where the first subindex , a , refers to the interaction used in the hf calculation , and the second subindex , b , to that used in the rpa one .",
    "the a and b labels can be t if the interaction includes the tensor term , i.e. if the d1st or the d1mt interaction has been used , and n otherwise .",

    "our results are compatible with those found in literature @xcite .",
    "the large difference between the theoretical and experimental @xmath67 values of the second state can be attributed to the limitations of the rpa which is unable to describe the large fragmentation of the second 1@xmath68 state .",
