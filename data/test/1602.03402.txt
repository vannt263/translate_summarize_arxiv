    "a special feature of electricity markets is the mean reverting behaviour of the spot prices . here , we want to investigate the role of this mean reversion on the pricing and hedging problem of european options on forwards . as the underlying forwards typically deliver the commodity over a period",
    ", one may expect that the effect averages out in the option price , depending on the speed of the mean reversion and on the length of the delivery period . in this paper , we want to quantify this effect , and determine upper and lower bounds for the pricing error if one or some mean reverting components of the electricity spot price are not taken into account .",
    "electricity spot prices are known to exhibit various characteristics that are rarely observed in other markets .",
    "one of these features is the multi - scale mean reverting behaviour .",
    "well known are the so - called spikes , large price shocks , which mean revert very fast towards the original price level and have a half life of about two days",
    ". however , slower mean reverting components are observable in the electricity markets , too .",
    "meyer - brandis and tankov @xcite find that at most european exchanges the autocorrelating structure of the spot prices can be described very well with a weighted sum of exponentials .",
    "this autocorrelation structure arises precisely for spot price models that include a sum of independent mean reverting processes , where the mean reversion takes place with different rates . as a consequence , they suggest a spot price model based on a sum of independent ornstein - uhlenbeck processes , and find for the eex that two or three mean reverting factors are suitable . now , the classical two - factor model after gibson and schwartz @xcite and schwartz and smith @xcite consists of only one mean reverting component , giving the short term variations of the spot price .",
    "additionally , a non - stationary long term component plays the role of a stochastic level of mean reversion and reflects long term expectations , as for example of political developments . combining the two approaches",
    ", we assume a multi - factor spot price model consisting of one non - stationary process and a sum of independent ornstein - uhlenbeck processes .",
    "when fitting multi - factor models to data , the question arises of how to filter from the observed time series the different , itself not observable components .",
    "this is essential step for pricing derivatives . in the literature , there are several approaches that consider models with two factors .",
    "many of them focus on filtering the spike component , see meyer - brandis and tankov @xcite , benth and schmeck @xcite , or filtering jumps ( borovkova and permana @xcite , at - sahalia @xcite ) . also , barlow et .",
    "al @xcite apply the technique of kalman filtering to electricity markets .",
    "nevertheless , if three or more factors are involved , the problem becomes even more challenging and it is therefore natural to investigate the impact of the factors on option pricing and hedging .    for this purpose , we consider options of european type , where the underlying is a forward . the standard way to price forwards is to define its price at time @xmath0 with delivery at @xmath1 as conditional expectation of the spot price @xmath2\\;,\\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq t,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for some pricing measure @xmath3 .",
    "though , electricity forwards typically deliver the underlying over a period , as a month , three months or a year . one alternative approach is therefore to incorporate the delivery period by defining the forward as expected average spot @xmath4\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we take , as we",
    "do in this paper , an exponential model for the spot price , we do not obtain closed form expressions for the forward price , which is a significant drawback when analysing option prices .",
    "however , we aim to use an exponential model since it is convenient in option pricing .",
    "indeed , a suitable exponential framework leads to black s formula @xcite , used in practice e.g. by eex @xcite . in order to meet the previous aim",
    "while still having a good analytical tractability , we thus follow the approach to model the delivery period by its midpoint and define the forward price by .",
    "if we take additionally into account that for energy options the delivery period starts at ( or shortly after ) the time @xmath5 of the exercise of the option , the length of the delivery period is given by @xmath6 .",
    "now , we would like to consider delivery periods of different length .",
    "fixing @xmath0 and @xmath5 , the delivery period increases considering the limit @xmath7 .    in this",
    "setting , benth and schmeck @xcite show that a fast mean reverting component does not significantly influence the price of an option . there , focusing on the spikes , they assume that the innovations of the fast mean reverting component are given by a pure jump lvy process . by introducing jumps to the model , the option price is no longer given by black s formula .",
    "nevertheless , the authors provide in @xcite an upper bound for the error one makes when pricing an option and neglecting the spike component .",
    "this bound is exponential and depends on the speed of mean reversion and the length of the delivery period .",
    "hence , for a big mean reversion parameter and a reasonable long delivery period , the error is very small such that the fast mean reverting jumps in the spot price dynamics are not relevant for option pricing . as a consequence ,",
    "black s formula gives a good approximation to the option price .",
    "here , we are concerned with the role of slow mean reversion in the underlying spot price dynamics to option pricing .",
    "although it is hard to justify that the innovations of the spikes are gaussian , one can always describe the drivers of the slower mean reverting components by brownian motions . since a slowly mean reverting component does not average out so fast in the forward price , one may expect to make an error in the option price , when the delivery period is comparably short .",
    "we are therefore interested in quantifying the minimum pricing error one has neglecting slowly mean reverting components . to this end",
    "we determine a lower bound for the error .",
    "we are even able to find an explicit analytical function for the asymptotic behaviour of the pricing error by providing both lower and upper bounds for it .",
    "we show that the pricing error takes the form of a sum of exponentially decaying terms , where the speed is determined through the mean reversion rate , as well as the parameters of the long term component .",
    "furthermore , we are interested in how the error in the option price transfers to the delta hedging component . + this paper is organized as follows . in chapter",
    "[ ch : prep ] we introduce the model for the spot price dynamics , we derive the forward price dynamics and the option price .",
    "we then determine the pricing error of the option when neglecting some mean reverting components in chapter [ ch : pricingerror ] .",
    "finally , delta hedging is considered in chapter [ ch : hedging ] .",
    "consider a filtered probability space @xmath8 and an equivalent probability measure @xmath3 .",
    "let the electricity spot price under @xmath3 be given by a multi - factor model in the spirit of the two factor model after gibson and schwartz @xcite , schwartz and smith @xcite and lucia and schwartz @xcite , and a sum of mean reverting factors as in benth et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a deterministic and bounded seasonality function .",
    "the non - stationary component is assumed to be a drifted brownian motion @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a standard brownian motion and @xmath13 are constant .",
    "the stationary factors are supposed to be ornstein - uhlenbeck processes @xmath14 for independent standard brownian motions @xmath15 , also independent of @xmath12 , and constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 . in",
    ", we choose the drivers of the stationary components to be gaussian in contrast to benth and schmeck @xcite , who use pure jump lvy processes .",
    "there , the main target are the spikes .",
    "those are big sudden upwards movements that mean revert quickly and it is therefore essential to choose a driver that allows for big price movements , that is jumps . in this paper ,",
    "the emphasis is on slowly mean reverting components and the drivers we choose here fulfil this task .",
    "+ the stationary factor @xmath19 can be interpreted as a long term factor , giving the general level of the prices and reflecting long term expectations towards political decisions , improving technologies or the storage level in case of storable commodities .",
    "the stationary factors @xmath20 , @xmath21 reflect the every day price variations due to supply and demand , and thus play the role of short term components .",

    "electricity forwards deliver the underlying energy usually over a period @xmath53 $ ] , as for example a month , a quarter of a year or a year .",
    "the delivery period smooths the effect of the mean reversion in the forward price and should thus also lower its influence in the option price .",

    "therefore , we consider additionally to a spot price dynamics where we neglect some of the mean reverting components in @xmath64 .",
    "for this purpose choose a subset @xmath65 of components and approximate by    @xmath66    the neglected mean reverting factors are then given by the set @xmath67 .",

    "the initial curve is explicitly given at time @xmath0 , while the volatility has to be estimated .",
    "therefore it it is reasonable to consider options with the same initial curve , but different volatilities .",
    "also , the more refined structure for the forward curve implied by more mean reverting components is assumed to be the most fitting one .",
    "hence , in the option price the chosen mean reverting components are reflected by the different volatilities @xmath76 and @xmath77 only .",

    "furthermore , it is possible to bound the volatilities by constants independent from @xmath47 @xmath83 with @xmath84 given as in .",

    "for option prices given by black s formula as in proposition [ prop : black ] , the delta hedge , the derivative of the option price with respect to the initial value , is given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 ( see for example benth et al .",
