    "the roadmap for fundamental physics in space issued by the european space agency ( esa ) in 2010  @xcite put an emphasis on gravitation tests in the solar system with missions to the outer planets . in this framework",
    ", it recommends the development of accelerometers compatible with spacecraft tracking at the 10 pm.s@xmath0 level at low frequencies .",
    "indeed , interplanetary probes can be used as test masses whose trajectories are to be compared to theoretical predictions . such a test has been performed by nasa with the pioneer 10 and 11 probes : the outcome was a discrepancy with respect to the predictions of general relativity @xcite .",
    "but these two probes lacked an instrument which could disentangle gravitational effects from non - gravitational ones . in order to improve the experiment made by the pioneer probes ,",
    "several space missions have been proposed @xcite , many of them embarking an accelerometer .",
    "the oss mission @xcite relies , for its fundamental physics objectives , on the gravity advances package @xcite .",
    "it is an instrument composed of an electrostatic accelerometer called microstar , based on onera expertise in the field of accelerometry and gravimetry with champ , grace , and goce missions  @xcite , and a rotating platform , called bias rejection system  ( brs ) . in orbit technology",
    "is used with technological upgrades aiming at reducing power consumption , size and mass .",
    "this instrument aims at measuring the non - gravitational acceleration of the spacecraft with a precision compatible with esa requirement and with no bias .",
    "thus , it provides an additional observable and allows removing , during the orbit restitution process , the effect of the non - gravitational forces on the trajectory , enhancing deep space gravitation tests as well as gravity field recovery  @xcite . the measurements made by microstar or any other electrostatic accelerometer always include an intrinsic bias which may vary with time or temperature .",
    "it calls for an additional subsystem able to remove the bias through the modulation of the signal of interest .",
    "this is the role of the bias rejection system . in order to remove properly the bias of microstar ,",
    "the bias rejection system rotates the accelerometer following a carefully designed periodical pattern  @xcite . in terms of measurement noise",
    ", this operation selects the noise of microstar around the modulation frequency .",
    "after post - processing and for a modulation period of @xmath1  min , it allows making absolute measurements with a white noise whose power spectrum density ( psd ) level is @xmath2  m.s@xmath0.hz@xmath3 with a cut - off frequency equal to @xmath4  hz .",
    "this corresponds , for an integration time of @xmath5  h , to a precision of @xmath6  pm.s@xmath0 and an exact measurement accuracy  @xcite .",
    "when taking into account the integration of the instrument in the spacecraft , and in particular the alignment accuracy ( @xmath7 @xmath6  mrad ) , the positioning accuracy and the spacecraft self - gravity , a global precision of 10  pm.s@xmath0 is expected .    the spacecraft of the oss mission has been specifically designed to reach this level of precision .",
    "the three main drivers taken into account are to ( i ) provide the lowest and most axisymmetrical gravitational field as viewed from gap , ( ii ) make coincide the dry mass center of gravity , the propellant center of gravity , the radiation pressure force line and the gap , and ( iii ) ensure a stable and reliable alignment between the gap and the high gain antenna to ensure consistency between radio science data and non - gravitational acceleration measurements .",
    "this led to the architecture presented in  @xcite : the platform is built as a flat ring and the gap is on a settable plate at the center , held by thermally stable struts .",
    "in addition , four hydrazine tanks are distributed symmetrically around the gap , with fluidic interconnections .",
    "it allows balancing the quantity of propellant and thus controlling the position of the center of mass of the spacecraft .",
    "the goal of the research project presented in this article is to validate experimentally the data processing method developed in @xcite .",
    "first , it will be shown that it is experimentally possible to completely remove the bias from the measurements .",
    "then , the precision on the unbiased acceleration obtained after post - processing will be compared to the predicted precision given the noise of the devices used in this experiment .",
    "these results will demonstrate the possibility to make unbiased acceleration measurements in real conditions using in space technology .",
    "therefore , they are a key milestone toward embarking the gravity advanced package on an interplanetary mission .    since the gravity advanced package is not available yet , commercial devices were used to mimic it : the `` measurement device '' which replaces the gravity advanced package and the overall experimental setup is described in section  [ section : materials ] . in section",
    "[ section : methods ] , the experimental methodology as well as the data processing is presented .",
    "finally , the results are discussed in section  [ section : results ] .",
    "the overall experimental setup is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : experimentalsetup ] shows .",
    "the `` measurement device '' , used to mimic the gravity advanced package , is described in section  [ subsection : accelerometer ] .",
    "a pendulum controlled by an electrostatic accelerometer , called dm1 , is used to impose a monitored external acceleration to the measurement device ( cf .",
    "section  [ subsection : pendulum ] ) .",
    "the measurement device is composed of :    * a rotating platform rgv100bl from newport @xcite which acts as the bias rejection system .",
    "the axis of rotation is called @xmath8 and is vertical",
    ". the rotation is parameterized by an angle called @xmath9 .",
    "the angle repeatability is equal to @xmath10. given the noise of the q - flex ( cf .",
    "[ fig : psd_qflex ] ) , the rotating platform does not introduce uncertainty in the measurement process . *",
    "two q - flex qa-700 accelerometers from honeywell @xcite .",
    "they are mono - axial accelerometers and are positioned orthogonally so as to have bi - axial measurements . the q - flex a and b measure local gravity along , respectively , the @xmath11 and @xmath12 axis of the frame attached to the rotating part of the rotating platform .",
    ".measured scale factor of the q - flex a [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the effect of the sampling frequency has also been investigated . because the harmonics of the calibration signal in the frequency domain decreases rapidly ,",
    "it is expected that the precision does not depend on the sampling frequency as far as it is two order of magnitude larger than the modulation frequency .",
    "that is why the sampling frequency does not appear in the approximated formula . in these experiments ,",
    "the larger modulation frequency is @xmath13  hz and the explored sampling frequencies are 10 , 100 and 200  hz , which are two orders of magnitude larger than 0.0167  hz . the results are summarized in table  [ table : frequency ] and show that the precision does not depend significantly on the sampling frequency for the range explored in these experiments .",
    "the set of experiments presented in this article was designed to validate the data processing scheme developed in order to remove the bias from the measurements made with an electrostatic accelerometer .",
    "to do so , two q - flex accelerometers mounted on a rotating platform were placed on a pendulum whose inclination was precisely controlled via a high - precision electrostatic accelerometer .",
    "the data gathered provided an experimental validation of the method .",
    "first , the ability to recover , after post - processing , the mean and the slope of the bias and of the unbiased acceleration has been demonstrated with experimental data . then , concerning the precision of the unbiased acceleration measurement , the experimental precisions have been compared to the theoretical predictions and a solid agreement has been obtained .    the experimental validation of this method devised to make unbiased acceleration measurement with an electrostatic accelerometer opens new opportunities .",
    "it will allow improved orbit restitution of interplanetary probes using an instrument with a strong heritage .",
