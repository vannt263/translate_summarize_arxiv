    ", the falling velocity and size of the fragments can be easily and accurately achieved .",
    "since an accurate prediction of the radius of curvature and vorticity magnitude are essential to the breakup process , these parameters are considered as refinement criteria , while the latter is also important to resolve the local turbulent eddies generated in the continues phase and close to the interface .",
    "in this part , the detailed mechanism of thin liquid sheet breakup is shown where the instability growth over the interface generates several punctures .",
    "the retraction of punctures produces a network of ligaments rapidly disintegrates into several number of small droplets .",
    "a video presenting the results obtained via direct numerical simulation is presented .",
    "outcomes demonstrates the capability of the current numerical methods to investigate the complex problem of falling droplets ."
