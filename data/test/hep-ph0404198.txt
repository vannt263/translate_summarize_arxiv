    "( throughout this paper , `` slepton '' denotes a charged slepton . ) both the gravitino and the nlsp have weak - scale masses .",
    "the nlsp freezes out as usual with a relic density near the observed value .",
    "however , after time @xmath0 , it decays through @xmath1 the gravitino then inherits much of the relic density of the slepton or sneutrino  @xcite , and its relic density is naturally of the right magnitude without the introduction of new scales .",
    "this is in contrast to other gravitino dark matter scenarios , where the gravitino is a thermal relic and the desired density is obtained by an appropriately chosen gravitino mass @xmath2  @xcite , or the gravitino is produced during reheating  @xcite , where the desired dark matter density is obtained only for a fine - tuned reheat temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the decays of eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) occur well after big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "an immediate concern , therefore , is that they might destroy the successful light element abundance predictions of bbn .",
    "in fact , bbn is not the only worry  the planckian spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the diffuse photon background , and bounds on late time entropy production from the coincidence between bbn and cmb baryometry all impose significant constraints . as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , these constraints on the electromagnetic ( em ) energy released in the decays of eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) exclude some of the weak scale parameter space , but leave much of it intact .",
    "of course , at the border between the excluded and allowed regions , slight deviations from standard cosmological predictions are expected , providing possible signals in future observations .",
    "in fact , the existing anomaly in the @xmath4li abundance prediction of standard bbn may already be interpreted as a signal of superwimp dark matter  @xcite .",
    "such signals are particularly welcome , since superwimp dark matter is so weakly interacting that it is impossible to detect through conventional direct and indirect dark matter searches .",
    "the previous work , however , neglected hadronic energy produced in wimp decays .",
    "this was natural , as the wimp decays of eq .",
    "( [ decay ] ) contribute only to electromagnetic energy , as we will discuss below .",
    "however , the three - body decays @xmath5 produce hadronic energy when the @xmath6 or @xmath7 decays hadronically .",
    "hadronic energy release is very severely constrained by the observed primordial light element abundances  @xcite , and so even subdominant hadronic decays could , in principle , provide stringent constraints .",
    "these three - body decays may be kinematically suppressed when @xmath8 , but even in this case , four - body decays , such as @xmath9 , contribute to hadronic cascades and may be important . in this paper , we determine the hadronic branching fractions and compare them to bbn constraints on hadronic energy release .",
    "although we focus on the supersymmetric case , our results may be extended straightforwardly with minor numerical modifications to the case of graviton superwimps in extra dimensions .    in evaluating the constraints",
    ", there are two possible approaches .",
    "as the superwimp relic abundance is automatically in the right range , a natural assumption is that superwimp gravitinos make up all of the non - baryonic dark matter , with @xmath10 this is the approach taken here .",
    "note that @xmath11 need not be identical to @xmath12  not all relic gravitinos need be produced by nlsp decays .",
    "our assumption therefore requires that the other sources of gravitinos be insignificant . for the supersymmetric case ,",
    "this typically implies an upper bound on reheat temperatures of @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "higher reheat temperatures may also be allowed  @xcite and are desirable , for example , to accommodate leptogenesis . for the universal extra dimension case ,",
    "the requirement of insignificant kaluza - klein graviton production during reheating implies @xmath14 to @xmath15 , depending , in part , on the number of extra dimensions  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the universe has proven to be remarkably baroque , and there is no guarantee that dark matter is composed of only one component .",
    "one might therefore relax the constraint of eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) on the superwimp energy density and assume , for example , that the nlsp freezes out with its thermal relic density @xmath16 .",
    "the superwimp gravitino density is then @xmath17 . in this approach",
    ", the gravitino density may be low and even insignficant cosmologically . from a particle physics viewpoint , however , the viability of the gravitino lsp scenario is still worth investigation , as it has strong implications for the superpartner spectrum and collider signatures , independent of its cosmological importance .",
    "these approaches differ significantly , not only in the viewpoint taken , but also in their implications .",
    "suppose , for example , that the gravitino and nlsp masses are both parametrized by a mass scale @xmath18 .",
    "the nlsp number density then scales as @xmath19 if one assumes eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) , but scales as @xmath18 if one assumes a thermal relic nlsp density , since @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the thermally - averaged nlsp annihilation cross section .",
    "low masses are excluded in the former case , while high masses are disfavored in the latter .",
    "we consider both approaches to be worthwhile , but defer discussion of the thermal relic density approach , along with its very different consequences for the superpartner spectrum and implications for collider physics , to a separate study  @xcite .    assuming a fixed @xmath11 here , we find that gravitino superwimps provide a viable solution to the dark matter problem .",
    "we determine the allowed masses for the nlsp and gravitino . at the same time , we find that the hadronic energy constraint is significant and does in fact provide the leading constraint in natural regions of parameter space . we conclude that the analysis below must be done in any scenario with similar late decays .",
    "given any standard cosmology , a significant thermal relic abundance of nlsps will be generated , these nlsps will eventually decay to superwimps , and the hadronic constraints we discuss below must be analyzed before the scenario may be considered viable .    in passing ,",
    "we note that another possibility is that the nlsp is the lightest neutralino . for a general neutralino",

    "given the stringency of constraints on hadronic energy release , the neutralino nlsp case is highly constrained .",
    "assuming that @xmath11 makes up a significant fraction of the dark matter , natural regions of parameter space are excluded  @xcite . in the current paper , we therefore focus on the more promising possibilities of slepton and sneutrino nlsps .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "hadronic energy release , and its effects on bbn , has also been considered  @xcite .",
    "although we are most interested in energy release at times @xmath52 , we summarize here what is known for @xmath53 for completeness .",
    "as we will show below , for the decay times of interest , mesons decay quickly and so contribute to em energy . only protons and neutrons",

    ", the constraints do not simply depend on the product , because the total number of secondary hadrons created by an injected hadron is not always proportional to the injected hadronic energy .",
    "the dominant constraint is from secondary baryons destroying @xmath26he to overproduce d.    quantitative analyses on the bbn constraints of the hadronic energy injection have been performed in refs .",

    "however , the most recent analysis  @xcite finds that for decay times @xmath67 , when the hadronic constraint is most important , the constraints depend on the product @xmath68 to within a factor of 2 for @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "we will therefore assume this behavior and apply the hadronic constraint to times @xmath70 , where it is stronger than the em constraint in the superwimp scenario .",

    "the ratio of @xmath28li/@xmath4li has been observed in low metallicity halo stars and might also constrain late decays .",
    "the implications for em cascades have also been explored in refs .",
    "again , however , there are arguably significant systematic uncertainties arising from the higher depletion of @xmath28li relative to @xmath4li as a result of its smaller binding energy  @xcite . a better understanding of the connection between the primordial and observed abundances of @xmath28li and @xmath4li could provide a very powerful constraint on late decaying particles  @xcite .",
