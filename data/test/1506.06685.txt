    "one of the most important methods used in characterizing young stars , and the only method that can establish membership in specific nearby young moving groups , is their kinematics .",
    "kinematics exploits the property that young stars ( at ages less than a billion years ) are still tracing the space motion of the gas from which they formed .",
    "several membership identification codes are available publically : banyan ( * ? ? ? * ( malo et al . 2013 ) ) , banyan ii ( * ? ? ? * ( gagne et al . 2014 ) ) ; a convergence code ( * ? ? ? * ( rodriguez et al . 2013 ) ) ; and ( soon ) , lacewing ( * ? ? ? * ( riedel et al . in prep ) ) .",
    "these codes use the six basic kinematic elements ( ra , dec , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and rv ) to predict probabilities of membership in nearby young moving groups , and can handle incomplete data .",
    "it is , however , important to know how to use and interpret the results of lacewing ( and codes like it ) to obtain the most accurate results .",
    "the lacewing code computes membership probabilities in 10 moving groups ( @xmath3 chameleon , tw hydra , @xmath4 pic , octans , tucana - horologium , columba , argus , ab doradus , hercules - lyra , and ursa major ) and 4 open clusters ( @xmath5 chameleon , the pleiades , coma berenices , and the hyades ) .",
    "the groups are represented as freely oriented triaxial ellipsoids , which are computed from new lists of bona - fide ( high confidence ) members taken from existing lists ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* malo et al . 2013 ) ) , and filtered using epicyclic tracebacks to limit membership to only the stars that were plausibly within the group s boundaries at the time of formation .",
    "the lacewing code matches stars to groups by computing up to four metrics of membership , matching the proper motion , distance , radial velocity , and spatial location of the star to those estimated for a group member at the same ra and dec .",
    "those metrics are combined into a single numerical goodness - of - fit value .",
    "the goodness - of - fit values are transformed into membership probabilities by creating a large simulation ( using 32 million stars ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* riedel et al . submitted ) ) of the solar neighborhood , which is then binned by goodness - of - fit value relative to a group .",
    "this is shown for @xmath4 pic and coma ber in fig.[fig : beta_pic ] , where all seven different possible combinations of data ( ra and dec are assumed to be known ) are given as different colors .",
    "curves are fit to those distributions to provide membership probabilities .",
    "pictoris moving group ( left ) and coma berenices open cluster ( right ) , showing the percentage of stars in each bin that are genuine members of the group / cluster .",
    "curves fit to these histograms ( dotted lines ) are used to translate the lacewing code s goodness - of - fit parameters to actual membership probabilities .",

    "some groups ( like the coma berenices open cluster ) have very distinctive uvw space velocities and space positions ( fig.[fig : ellipses ] ) , which translate into uniquely identifying proper motion and radial velocity estimates for any given star .",
    ", width=480 ]    as an example , the large simulation of stars in fig.[fig : beta_pic ] shows us that for the case in which all kinematic elements are available ( ra , dec , plus proper motion , distance , and rv ) , a goodness - of - fit value of 0.75 relative to @xmath4 pic yields a roughly 50% probability that the object is a member of @xmath4 pic .",
    "the stars matched to coma ber show that , for the equivalent case using all available data , a goodness - of - fit of 0.75 yields a nearly 100% probability that the object is a member of coma ber .",
    "fig.[fig : beta_pic ] shows the seven different data availability scenarios lacewing expects : ra and dec plus all combinations of proper motion , radial velocity , and distance . for @xmath4 pic , the proper motion method",
    "( red dashed line ) demonstrates that even in the best possible case of a goodness - of - fit = 0 , the probability of membership is only 35% , i.e. 65% of those perfect matches to @xmath4 pic are actually ( simulated ) members of other moving groups and the generic field population . adding a radial velocity ( pink triangles ) increases the best - case probability to 80%/20% contamination .",
    "another good reason to obtain more kinematic information is to reduce the false positive contamination ( fig.[fig : beta_pic_falsepositive ] ) of a survey . with only proper motion and a fixed cutoff of 20% probability , over 80% of the objects in a survey",
    "will be contaminants ( to be weeded out by some other technique , such as spectroscopy ) .",
    "having complete data for the star of interest reduces the contamination rate to just above 40% .",
    "virtually all lithium is primordial and easily fused by objects over roughly 60 jupiter masses .",
    "therefore , a low mass object with detectable lithium must either be a brown dwarf , or a young star .",
    "* riedel et al . ( submitted ) ) assembled a sample of roughly 500 lithium - detected nearby stars and used those stars as a test sample for lacewing , reasoning that these should be the best nearby young moving group members .",
    "however , nearly half the sample did not match any of the known nearby young moving groups lacewing tests for . the same lithium - detected sample was run through other moving group codes - banyan i and ii , and the convergence code - with similar results . some lithium - detected stars were not sorted into moving groups ( fig.[fig : nongroup ] ) .",
    "20 m ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( murphy & lawson 2015 ) ) , a proper motion , a radial velocity , and no distance .",
    "if we generate a range of reasonable distances for the star , it could spatially be within the octans ( cyan ) moving group , but it can not possibly share the space velocity of octans , and can not be a member ( as previously noted by murphy ) [ fig : nongroup],width=326 ]    there are three potential reasons for this : 1 . )",
    "there are additional nearby young stellar groups not currently known or accounted for ; 2 . ) there is a young field population not part of any previously identified groups ; 3 . )",
    "our current understanding of the kinematics of moving groups is incomplete .",
    "the fact that multiple moving group codes ( each with a different algorithm and kinematic model of the nearby young moving groups ) could not identify large numbers of stars as members of nearby young moving groups suggests that the explanation probably involves some combination of the first two points .",
    "ultimately , the message is clear : young stars do not need to be members of a known nearby young moving group .",
    "`` none of the above '' can be a correct answer .",
    "as we enter the third decade of nearby young star research , there is much more to be done from the standpoint of membership statistics . moving group identification codes such as lacewing",
    "will continue to provide essential tools in studies of stellar and planetary formation and evolution , but care must still be taken in interpreting their results ."
