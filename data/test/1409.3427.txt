    "in  @xcite barot and marsh provided presentations of finite weyl groups in terms of arbitrary quivers or diagrams of finite type . in brief , the construction works as follows : one needs to consider the underlying unoriented labeled graph of a quiver ( or diagram ) as a coxeter diagram of a ( usually infinite ) coxeter group , and then impose some additional relations on this group that can be read off from the quiver / diagram .",
    "it is proved in  @xcite that the resulting group depends on the mutation class of a quiver / diagram only , see section  [ group ] for the details .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use these presentations to construct hyperbolic manifolds , in particular ones of small volume .",
    "the most common way to construct hyperbolic manifolds is by considering finite index torsion - free subgroups of cofinite hyperbolic reflection groups ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the approach used in the present paper is completely different : we start with a _ symmetry group _ of a manifold , more precisely , we are looking for a manifold whose symmetry group contains a given finite weyl group . in  @xcite everitt and maclachlan",
    "describe an algebraic framework for this approach , and in  @xcite kolpakov and slavich explicitly construct an arithmetic hyperbolic @xmath0-manifold with given finite isometry group .",
    "we use quite different techniques based on _ mutations of quivers and diagrams _ defined by fomin and zelevinsky in the context of cluster algebras .",
    "this technique allows us to obtain manifolds having large symmetry groups and , at the same time , relatively small volume , i.e. two properties of quite opposite nature .",
    "mutation classes of quivers and diagrams of finite type are indexed by finite weyl groups .",
    "our interpretation of the result of  @xcite is that , starting from a quiver or diagram @xmath1 of finite type , one can present the corresponding finite weyl group @xmath2 as a quotient of some ( usually infinite ) coxeter group @xmath3 by the normal closure @xmath4 of additional relations .",
    "if this coxeter group @xmath3 is hyperbolic , then the weyl group @xmath2 acts properly on the quotient of the hyperbolic space by the group @xmath4 .",
    "_ a  priori _",
    ", this quotient may have singular points .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "the group @xmath4 is torsion - free .    as a corollary ,",
    "if the coxeter group @xmath3 is hyperbolic and cofinite , we obtain a hyperbolic manifold of finite volume , and the symmetry group of this manifold contains @xmath2 .",
    "we list the manifolds that we found in this way in tables  [ hyp ] and  [ hyp - n ] . in dimension",
    "@xmath0 we construct a manifold with euler characteristic @xmath5 , i.e. it has the second minimal volume amongst all @xmath0-dimensional manifolds .",
    "the symmetry group of this manifold contains the group @xmath6 as a subgroup .",
    "we note that , since this manifold has small volume and large symmetry group at the same time , it does not appear in  @xcite .    in  @xcite we generalized the results of  @xcite to quivers and diagrams of affine type and certain other mutation - finite quivers and diagrams . in particular , every affine weyl group also admits presentations of a similar type with slightly more complicated groups @xmath4 . using this result , in section  [ aff ] we provide the following theorem .",
    "the manifold property holds for quivers and diagrams of affine type .    for quivers and diagrams originating from unpunctured surfaces or orbifolds",
    "@xcite , as well as for exceptional mutation - finite quivers and diagrams  @xcite , the construction in  @xcite also provides a group assigned to a mutation class .",
    "in contrast to the finite and affine cases , this group is not a coxeter group , however , it also has presentations as a quotient of a coxeter group @xmath7 ( with more types of generators for @xmath8 required ) .    using these presentations , for every quiver or diagram @xmath1 of all types discussed above",
    ", we construct a cw - complex ( actually being a quotient of the davis complex of a coxeter group @xmath3 ) with a proper action of the group @xmath9 , where the group @xmath10 depends on the mutation class of @xmath1 only . we also define mutations of these complexes , the mutations agree with quiver ( or diagram ) mutations .",
    "all the manifolds discussed above are partial cases of these complexes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ background ] contains basic definitions and some essential facts on coxeter groups and quiver mutations . in section  [ group ]",
    "we recall the construction from  @xcite assigning to a quiver of finite type a presentation of the corresponding weyl group . for simplicity , in sections  [ group][davis ] we restrict ourselves to simply - laced weyl groups ( and thus , we work with quivers rather than diagrams ) , we then consider the general case in section  [ sec diagr ] . in section  [ various actions ]",
    "we describe the construction highlighted above of various actions of a given finite weyl group . in section  [ examples ]",
    "we first treat in full details our construction applied to the group @xmath11 ; then we list other geometric manifolds with weyl group actions resulted from the algorithm described in section  [ various actions ] .",
    "in particular , table  [ hyp ] contains the list of hyperbolic manifolds we obtain . in section  [ davis ] , after defining the davis complex of a coxeter group , we prove the manifold property .",
    "we also define mutations of quotients of davis complexes agreeing with quiver mutations .",
    "section  [ sec diagr ] is devoted to generalizations of the results to all finite weyl groups .",
    "finally , in section  [ inf ] we describe how the construction generalizes to affine weyl groups and some other infinite groups related to quivers and diagrams of finite mutation type .",
    "we briefly remind some basic properties of coxeter groups . for the details see  @xcite .      a group @xmath2",
    "is called a ( finitely generated ) _ coxeter group _ if it has a presentation of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 for all @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 means that there is no relation on @xmath17 . a pair @xmath18 of a coxeter group @xmath2 and its set of generators @xmath19",

    "given a coxeter system @xmath22 , one can write a symmetric @xmath29 matrix @xmath30 as follows : @xmath31    an @xmath29 matrix @xmath32 is _ decomposable _ if there is a non - trivial partition of the index set as @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 whenever @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",

    "action by reflections _",
    "we mean an action where the reflections of @xmath2 are represented by orthogonal reflections with respect to hyperplanes ) .",
    "more precisely , there are three cases of interest :    * @xmath37 is positive definite : then @xmath2 is a finite group and @xmath2 acts on a sphere @xmath38 ; * @xmath37 is indecomposable and has signature @xmath39 : then @xmath2 acts cocompactly on euclidean space @xmath40 ; * @xmath37 is indecomposable and has signature @xmath41 : then @xmath2 acts on an @xmath42-dimensional hyperbolic space @xmath43 .",
    "see  @xcite for the details .",
    "a fundamental domain of such an action is a connected component of the complement to the set of all hyperplanes fixed pointwise by reflections of the group .",
    "this fundamental domain is a polytope ( which may be of infinite volume ) with facets indexed by generators @xmath44 and all dihedral angles equal to @xmath45 ( if @xmath16 the corresponding facets do not intersect ) . such polytopes are called _",
    "coxeter polytopes_.    [ root ] if a coxeter group @xmath2 is a finite or affine weyl group , then the outer normal vectors to the facets of the fundamental polytope can be identified with the simple roots of the corresponding root system .",
    "in the three cases listed above the group @xmath2 is called _ geometric _ ( note that our class of geometric coxeter groups is wider than in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) ) .",
    "in fact , every coxeter group acts properly cocompactly by reflections on some specially constructed space  @xcite , we will discuss this action in section  [ davis ] .",

    "we deal with quivers of finite mutation type only .",
    "in  @xcite barot and marsh show that for each quiver of finite type there is a way to explicitly construct the corresponding weyl group .",

    "it is shown in  @xcite that these generators of @xmath65 can be found inductively in the following way :    * for @xmath75 the generators @xmath76 are standard coxeter generators ( indeed , dynkin diagrams contain no cycles , so , we will get no cycle relations and obtain standard presentation of the coxeter group ) .",

    "the group @xmath81 depends on the quiver @xmath64 chosen in the mutation class of @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , depending on the choice of @xmath64 , the group @xmath81 may be finite or infinite . as a consequence , it may act naturally by reflections on different spaces ( sphere , euclidean space , hyperbolic space or , in general , the davis complex of the group @xmath81 , see section  [ davis ] ) . since @xmath86 , this results in actions of the initial coxeter group @xmath2 on different spaces .    in section  [ davis ]",
    "we show that the group @xmath83 is torsion - free ( we call this _ manifold property _ ) .",
    "in particular , this implies that if the coxeter group @xmath81 acts properly on a space @xmath87 or @xmath88 by isometries with a fundamental domain of finite volume , then the quotient @xmath89 is a finite volume manifold with a symmetry group containing @xmath2 . in the next section",
    "we show examples of the construction of hyperbolic manifolds in this way , as well as of actions of weyl groups of type @xmath90 on flat tori .",
    "we now present the first ( and the easiest ) example showing how different actions of the same coxeter group may by produced via mutations of quivers .",
    "we start with the quiver @xmath46 of type @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ stereo](a),(b ) ) .",
    "the corresponding dynkin diagram of type @xmath11 determines a finite coxeter group @xmath2 acting on the @xmath5-dimensional sphere by reflections : @xmath91 the fundamental domain of this action is a spherical triangle with angles @xmath92 , see fig .",

    "the group @xmath94 is the group generated by reflections in the sides of a regular triangle in the euclidean plane ( the corresponding dynkin diagram is of type @xmath95 ) , see fig .",

    "note that the plane is tessellated by infinitely many copies of the fundamental domain , each copy @xmath96 labeled by an element @xmath97 . to see the action of the initial group @xmath98 we need to take a quotient by the cycle relation @xmath99 which means that in the tessellated plane we identify @xmath100 with the fundamental triangle labeled by the @xmath101 .",
    "now , let us see what the transformation @xmath102 means geometrically .",
    "the element @xmath103 acts on the plane as the reflection in the side @xmath104 of @xmath100 , @xmath105 is the reflection with respect to the line @xmath106 parallel to @xmath104 and passing through the vertex of @xmath100 not contained in @xmath104 . denote by @xmath74 the distance between @xmath104 and @xmath106 .",
    "then the transformation @xmath107 is a translation of the plane by the distance @xmath108 in the direction orthogonal to @xmath104 .",

    "this implies that we also need to take a quotient of the plane by the actions of the elements @xmath112 and @xmath113 , i.e. by the translations by @xmath109 in directions orthogonal to the lines @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the quotient of the plane by the group @xmath83 generated by three translations @xmath116 and @xmath117 is a flat torus , see fig .",
    "[ plane](c ) .",
    "thus , we obtain an action of the quotient group @xmath98 on the torus : the fundamental domain of this action is a regular triangle , @xmath118 copies of this triangle tile the torus ( as @xmath118 copies tile the hexagon ) .",
    "[ non - reflection ] the action described above is not an action by ( topological ) reflections : the fixed sets of the generators @xmath119 are connected , so they do not divide the torus into two connected components ( cf .",

    "recall from section  [ pres ] that the presentation for @xmath65 is obtained from the presentation for @xmath120 by the following change of generators @xmath121 in the above sections we considered the action of the @xmath122-generators on the sphere and of the @xmath123-generators on the plane and the torus .",
    "however , the @xmath123-generators may be also considered directly on the sphere .",
    "namely , let @xmath124 be the reflections with respect to the corresponding sides @xmath125 of the fundamental spherical triangle @xmath126 , see fig .",

    "the element @xmath103 is also a reflection as it is conjugate to the reflection @xmath129 ; more precisely , @xmath103 is a reflection with respect to the ( spherical ) line @xmath130 ( see fig .  [ cover](b ) ) .",
    "consider the triangle @xmath131 bounded by @xmath132 , and @xmath133 ( there are 8 possibilities to choose such a triangle , see remark  [ rem choice ] for the justification of our choice ) .    in contrast to the triangle @xmath126 bounded by @xmath125 ,",
    "the triangle @xmath131 is not a fundamental triangle for the action : @xmath131 has angles @xmath134 , and the group generated by @xmath127 and @xmath128 has order 6 , but the whole neighborhood of the vertex @xmath135 is tiled by @xmath136 copies of @xmath131 only .    to resolve this inconsistency we consider a @xmath5-sheet covering of the sphere branched in @xmath137 and in all @xmath2-images of @xmath137 ( the four bold points in fig .",
    "[ cover](b ) ) .",
    "clearly , the covering space is a torus ( moreover , one can easily see that the covering is given by weierstrass @xmath138-function ) .",
    "it is also not difficult to see that the action of @xmath11 on this covering torus is exactly the same as its action on the torus in section  [ torus ] : the covering torus consists of @xmath118 triangles , and every vertex is incident to exactly six triangles .    [ rem choice ] consider the outer normals @xmath139 to the sides of @xmath126 ( cf .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath21 is a genus @xmath136 surface .    similarly to section  [ sph to tor ] describing @xmath11 case , one can see that @xmath21 can be obtained as a ramified degree @xmath0 covering of the sphere branching at six points composing the orbit of the `` central point '' ( see fig .

    "the result of  @xcite allows to generalize the construction to infinite groups .",
    "more precisely , it is shown in  @xcite that to a diagram @xmath1 of finite mutation type that either is exceptional ( see  @xcite ) or arises from a triangulation of a unpunctured surface or orbifold ( see  @xcite ) one can assign a coxeter group @xmath3 ( using exactly the same rule as above ) .",
    "this implies that we can repeat verbatim the construction of actions on factors of the davis complex @xmath394 , so that we get an action of an ( infinite ) group @xmath395 on the quotient space @xmath396 .",
    "furthermore , as before , a mutation of @xmath1 induces a mutation of @xmath397 .      a diagram @xmath1 is called a diagram of _ affine type _ if @xmath1 is mutation - equivalent to an orientation of an affine dynkin diagram different from an oriented cycle .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1 is of affine type , the group @xmath398 is an affine coxeter group .",
    "mutation classes of diagrams of affine type may be rather complicated ( see  @xcite for the detailed description of mutation classes of non - exceptional diagrams of finite and affine type ) .",
    "in particular , a diagram @xmath1 in the mutation class may contain one arrow labeled by @xmath0 ( this corresponds to two reflections in a coxeter system of @xmath3 generating an infinite dihedral group , or , equivalently , to two non - intersecting facets of a fundamental chamber of @xmath399 ) .",
    "we are currently unable to drop the assumption that @xmath1 is of affine type .",
    "our proof of manifold property uses an induction on the number of mutations one needs to perform to obtain a diagram without oriented cycles ( such diagrams are called _ acyclic _ , and diagrams from their mutation classes are _ mutation - acyclic _ ) . if @xmath1 is not of finite or affine type , then either @xmath1 is not mutation - acyclic , or it is not mutation - finite ( see  @xcite ) .",
