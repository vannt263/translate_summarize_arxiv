    "it is well known that the fiber optical parametric amplifiers ( fopas ) , employing @xmath0 nonlinearity based four wave mixing ( fwm ) to transfer energy from one or two strong pump fields to a weak signal field , can be used in the conventional optical communication systems for signal - processing applications , such as optical amplification , phase conjugation , optical limiters , 3r generators , and time - domain de - multiplexer etc .",
    "in fact , similar to the @xmath1 crystals based optical parametric amplifiers ( opas )  @xcite , fopas are also candidates for generating non - classical light for quantum communication  @xcite .    in quantum communication",
    ", information can be encoded discretely on each photon or continuously in quadrature - phase amplitudes of an optical field .",
    "the former requires single - photon sources that can be generated with weak nonlinear interaction  @xcite , but the latter relies on strong interaction to generate quantum correlation between the amplitudes of optical fields for entanglement  @xcite .",
    "moreover , continuous variable ( cv ) entanglement offers several advantages over its discrete variable counterpart .",
    "the main advantage is the experimental feasibility in unconditional production of entangled states which in turn enables quantum information protocols to be accomplished unconditionally  @xcite .",
    "the past decade has seen the growing interest in developing nonclassical light sources via the fwm in fibers , because they are compatible with the fiber network  @xcite . in order to enhance the fwm and to suppress the raman scattering  @xcite ,",
    "a pulse pumped fopa is preferred because the peak power of pulsed laser is very high even at a modest average power . however , for the majority of the experiments performed to date , the fwm in fiber is in the low gain regime , and the fiber based nonclassical light sources with vacuum injection are in the domain of a few photons and thus can be only employed for discrete variable information encoding . in order to develop the fiber based source of the cv nonclassical light , the pulse pumped fopa needs to be operated in the high gain regime .    up to now , only a couple of experiments reported the generation of cv nonclassical light via the pulse pumped fwm in fibers @xcite . in 2001 , sharping and co - works realized the pulsed twin beams by using the fopa for the first time @xcite . the amplified signal and",
    "generated idler beams bear a strong quantum correlation in intensity ( photon - number ) fluctuations in the sense that the quantum noise level of their intensity difference is lower than the shot - noise limit ( snl ) . in that experiment ,",
    "the gain of fwm is less than 3 and the observed intensity difference noise of twin beams is only about 1.1 db ( 2.6 db after correction for losses ) lower than the snl .",
    "recently , using the fopa with photon number gain of about 16 db , our group demonstrated the twin beams with the intensity - difference noise below the snl by 3.1 db ( 10.4 db after correction for losses ) @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that compared with its @xmath1 crystal counterparts  @xcite , the pulse pumped high gain fopa is a simple and promising system for generating the cv nonclassical light , which has the potential applications in realizing the quantum communication protocols and in performing the high precision measurement .",
    "there have been a few theoretical papers analyzing the generation of pulsed cv nonclassical light via the high gain @xmath1 crystals based opas  @xcite . for the pulse pumped high gain fopas",
    ", however , the investigation is mostly within the domain of classical characteristics  @xcite and the quantum theory has not been worked out yet .",
    "this is different from the case of continuous wave ( cw ) or quasi - cw pumped high gain fopas  @xcite . in order to understand the high gain fopa for further reducing the intensity difference noise of pulsed twin beams",
    ", we focus on developing a multi - mode quantum theory in this paper .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly introducing the quantum description of a single - mode fopa in sec .",
    "ii , we deduce a multi - mode quantum theory of a pulse pumped non - degenerate fopa in sec .",
    "the evolution of non - degenerate signal and idler beams is described by the bogoliubov transformation in a multi - frequency mode form . according to the hamiltonian of fwm in fibers ,",
    "we derive the four transformation functions of the bogoliubov transformation in the analytical form of infinite series .",
    "the calculation shows that the noise performance of the high gain fopa highly depends on the joint spectral function ( jsf ) . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that the fopa with factorized jsf can be described by a quantum model of single - mode fopa , which is similar to the model given in sec .",
    "ii , because both signal and idler beams can be in single temporal mode , respectively .",
    "the results illustrate the validity of the multi - mode theory . in sec .",
    "v , we focus on analyzing the fopa with a very broad gain bandwidth . in this situation , the jsf is non - factorable .",
    "the calculated results show that although the pulse pumped high gain fopa generally has a noise figure greater than the 3 db quantum limit , the intensity difference noise of the twin beams , weakly depends on the jsf , can be significantly reduced to lower than the snl . to closely resemble the real experimental situation ,",
    "the dependence of the intensity difference noise of twin beams is numerically studied by considering the influences of experimental imperfections , including the quantum efficiencies of detectors , the collection efficiency of twin beams , and the excess noise of input signal .",

    "therefore , a high gain fopa is desirable for improving the noise reduction of twin beams .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed the multi - mode quantum theory for analyzing the noise characteristics of a non - degenerate phase insensitive fopa pumped by a pulsed laser .",
    "the calculation shows that both the noise figure and the intensity difference noise of twin beams depend on the jsf . in the high gain regime ,",
    "the noise figure is generally greater than the 3db quantum limit unless the jsf is factorable and the spectrum of the injected signal well matches the gain spectrum in signal band ; while the intensity difference noise can be significantly less than the snl . to closely resemble the experiments , the quantum noise of twin beams generated by a broadband fopa",
    "is numerically studied by taking the real experimental conditions into account .",
    "in addition to the influences of the quantum efficiency of detectors and the excesses noise of input signal , the influence of the collection efficiency of the twin beams , determined by the ratio of the pump bandwidth to signal bandwidth @xmath303 and the ratio of the signal bandwidth to filter bandwidth @xmath361 , are carefully analyzed as well .",
    "our theoretical investigation is of practical importance , it not only serves as a guideline for optimizing the measured noise reduction of the twin beams , but also helps for understanding the quantum noise preformance of pulse pumped fopa .    instead of using the bloch - messiah reduction or schmidt decomposition of the jsf , which has been exploited to theoretically analyze the pulsed cv nonclassical light via the high gain spontaneous parametric down conversions in refs .",
    "@xcite , our transformation functions of the bogoliubov transformation are expressed in the infinite series of the gain coefficient @xmath269 .",
    "the accuracy of our numerical simulation can be controlled by the two parameters : one is the precision of the jsf determined by the step size of the frequency range , the other is the order of the series determined by the gain of fwm .",
    "so our method has a greater flexibility .",
    "we believe our theory can be extended to a more generalized opa , including the degenerate opa and the phase - sensitive opa .",
    "moreover , our theory can also be used to study the quantum noise of other quantities , such as the noise correlation between the quadrature amplitudes of the signal and idler beams .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that the fopa in our model is simplified as a linear amplifier , and we only considered the fwm process . therefore , our calculation only quantitatively explains the results obtained under the condition of negligible pump depletion  @xcite . to model the fopa system",
    "more accurately , other effects like raman effect , higher - order fwm and gain saturation effect should be included as well  @xcite .",
