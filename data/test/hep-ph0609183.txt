    "multi - particle equations are a traditional basis for a quantum - field description of bound states in particle physics .",
    "a well - known example of these equations is the two - particle bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for the two - particle amplitude and for the two - particle bound state @xcite.the multi - particle ( three or more particle ) generalizations of the bse have been also studied .",
    "a straightforward generalization of two - particle bse has been intensively studied in sixties - seventies of last century .",
    "a best exposition of these studies can be found in the work of huang and weldon @xcite . + an essential imperfection of the original bethe - salpeter approach to multi - particle equations was a full disconnection of the approach with the field - theoretical equations for green functions ( which are known as schwinger - dayson equations ( sde ) ) .",
    "this imperfection has been eliminated by dahmen and jona - lasinio , which had included the bse to the field - theoretical lagrangian formalism with the consideration of functional legendre transformation with respect to bilocal source of fields @xcite .",
    "then this approach has been generalized for multi - particle equations with consideration of legendre transformation with respect to multi - local sources @xcite .",
    "+ however , these theoretical constructions had not solved the principal dynamical problem of quantitative description of real bound states ( nucleons , mesons etc . ) .",
    "a solution of bse - type equations has been founded as a very complicated mathematical tool even for simple dynamical model .",
    "there is a main reason of a comparatively small popularity of the method of multi - particle bse - type equations among the theorists .",
    "much more popular approach to the problem of hadronization in qcd is based on the t hooft s conjecture that qcd can be regarded as an effective theory of mesons and glueballs @xcite .",
    "subsequently , it was shown by witten that the baryons could be viewed as the solitons of the meson theory @xcite .",
    "futher development of these ideas has been successful and has leaded to the prediction of pentaquark states in baryon spectrum @xcite .",
    "+ nevertheless , the investigations of multi - quark equations are of significant interest due to the much less model assumptions in this approach in comparison with the chiral - soliton models . the solutions of multi - quark equations will provide us almost exhaustive information about the structure of hadrons .",
    "there is basic motivation of present work .",
    "+ we shall investigate nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with quark content which is one of the most successful effective models of qcd in the non - perturbative region ( for review see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in overwhelming majority of the investigations , the njl model has been considered in the mean - field approximation or in the leading order of @xmath0- expansion . however , a number of perspective physical applications of njl model is connected with multi - quark functions ( for example : meson decays , pion - pion scattering , baryons , pentaquarks etc . ) .",
    "these multi - quark functions arise in higher orders of mean - field expansion(mfe ) for njl model . to formulate mfe",
    "we have used an iteration scheme of solution of sde with fermion bilocal source @xcite .",
    "+ we have considered equations for green functions of njl model in mfe up to third order .",
    "the leading approximation and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of mfe maintain equations for the quark propagator and the two - quark function and also the nlo correction to the quark propagator .",
    "the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) of mfe maintains the equations for four - quark and three - quark functions , and next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order(nnnlo ) of mfe maintains the equations for six - quark and five - quark functions .",
    "we consider njl model with the lagrangian    @xmath1 . \\label{lsu2}\\ ] ]    the lagrangian is invariant under transformations of chiral group @xmath2 , which correspond to u - d quark sector .",
    "a generating functional of green functions ( vacuum expectation values of @xmath3-products of fields ) can be represented as the functional integral with bilocal source : @xmath4 @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the bilocal source of the quark field .    the n - th functional derivative of @xmath7 over source @xmath8 is the n - particle ( 2n - point ) green function : @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 translational invariance of the functional - integration measure gives us the functional - differential sde for the generating functional @xmath7 :    @xmath12}\\ ] ] @xmath13}\\big\\}\\ ] ]    @xmath14    we shall solve this equation employing the method which proposed in work @xcite .",

    "the unique connected green function of the leading approximation is the quark propagator .",
    "other connected green functions appear in the following iteration steps .",
    "the quark propagator in the chiral limit is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dynamical quark mass , which is a solution of gap equation .",
