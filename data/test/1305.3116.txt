    "nonlinear globally coupled systems under the influence of noise have been an active field of research over the last few decades @xcite . for additive noise",
    "there is a natural and far - reaching analogy to equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "we consider an array of @xmath1 harmonically coupled overdamped anharmonic oscillators subject to additive noise which is governed by the system of langevin equations @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "each of the oscillators is harmonically coupled to all the others ( global coupling ) , the total strength of the coupling is @xmath4 .",
    "the additive noise @xmath5 is a zero mean gaussian white process with autocorrelation @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the noise strength .",
    "the steady state of an isolated system without noise ( @xmath8 ) undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation if the control parameter @xmath9 changes the sign .",
    "the isolated system ( @xmath10 ) describes diffusion in a potential with one or two minima depending on the sign of @xmath9 which is thoroughly studied since @xcite . in the limit",
    "@xmath11 the array exhibits a continuous phase transition with a critical point @xmath12 and the mean field critical exponent @xmath13 such that for @xmath14 the stationary probability density @xmath15 is symmetric with respect to @xmath16 , and for @xmath17 it is non - symmetric such that the order parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on the other parameters has been investigated already by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "kometani and shimizu @xcite closed the equation of motion for the moments using a decoupling which is correct for gaussian distributed variables .",
    "the critical point is determined by the occurrence of a non - trivial solution .",
    "this yields , in our notation , @xmath19 which is asymptotically correct for weak noise , see below .",
    "desai and zwanzig @xcite described the system by a self - consistent dynamic mean field theory .",
    "they evaluated numerically the correct phase transition condition and observed that the critical point deviates from the result of a gaussian approximation .",
    "dawson @xcite correctly claimed existence and uniqueness of the critical parameter .",
    "we show that he used a wrong argument and give a different proof of uniqueness .",
    "he proved in the limit of infinitely many oscillators that the fluctuations at the critical point are non - gaussian and occur at a slower time scale than the noncritical fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , he observed that for @xmath20 the critical point can be computed up to a quadrature .",
    "van den broeck and collaborators",
    "@xcite also gave numerical results for the parameter dependence of @xmath0 in mean field theory and compared this with simulations for a system with nearest neighbor coupling in @xmath21 .",
    "implicitly they state that for strong coupling ( @xmath22 ) the critical point is @xmath23 , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "shiino @xcite proved a @xmath24-theorem showing thus that the stationary state is asymptotically reached for long times and analyzed the stability of the trivial and the symmetry breaking solutions .",

    "@xmath25 represent velocities rather than coordinates and the system can be regarded as an early example of a canonical - dissipative system @xcite , which have been proposed to describe , e.g. , swarm dynamics @xcite .",
    "the harmonic coupling between nearest neighbors of a regular lattice can be conceived as discretization of the laplace operator .",
    "thus , in the continuum limit there is a relation to mean field solutions of a class of models described by stochastic partial differential equations , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "there is further a relation to the discretized version of the @xmath26-ginzburg - landau model , in different context also known as soft - spin ising model .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors studied spin glasses , where the coupling strength for each pair of coordinates @xmath25 , @xmath27 is an independent gaussian distributed random variable .",
    "noise induced phenomena in a double - well potential are still a topic of recent research .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors investigated a fokker - planck equation driven by dynamical constraints , modeling many - particle storage systems .    for a similar system driven by multiplicative noise instead of additive noise also continuous phase transitions",
    "the critical exponent of the order parameter @xmath28 undergoes a transition from a constant ( though non - mean field ) value towards a parameter - dependent value when @xmath29 exceeds a threshold @xcite .",
    "also higher moments @xmath30 show such transitions @xcite .",
    "it is a natural question whether this behavior is robust against additive noise , since in natural systems additive noise is apparently unavoidable .",
    "although many papers study systems with additive and multiplicative noise ( for early refs .",
    "see @xcite ) this question has not been explicitly addressed . to determine critical exponents it is advantageous to know analytically the parameter dependence of the critical manifold .",
    "besides our general interest this is an additional motivation to study the present system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we reformulate the model in the fokker - planck picture and explain the self - consistent mean field approach which becomes exact in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "we show that the self - consistency condition is equivalent with the stationarity condition for the center of mass variable .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : critmnf ] we prove the existence of a well - behaved critical manifold in the parameter space which separates the regime with @xmath31 from the regime with broken symmetry .",
    "the critical manifold is determined by an implicit integral equation , the phase transition condition ( ptc ) . to show its wellbehavedness it is necessary to know that the critical parameter @xmath12 is bounded by values which are asymptotically reached in the limits of strong and weak noise , respectively .",
    "the wellbehavedness of the critical manifold allows to reduce the number of parameters by rescaling and implies that @xmath32 is only a function of the ratio @xmath33 .",
    "thus it exhibits the same behavior for strong coupling as for weak noise , and for weak coupling as for strong noise .    exploiting that the critical manifold is well - behaved ,",
    "together with exact relations of moments on this manifold we derive an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for @xmath32 as a function of @xmath34 . to determine a solution for small and large values of @xmath34 we use a series expansion .",
    "the results from the ode are the same as from an evaluation of the ptc using the laplace method but easier to obtain .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the series agrees with that of the numerical solution of the ptc .",
    "we were not able to prove convergence of these series , but for small @xmath34 a pad approximant agrees well with the numerical solution .",
    "we also give results for a series expansion around @xmath35 which is analytically treatable .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : critbeh ] we determine the behavior of the order parameter and the susceptibility near the critical manifold .",
    "thanks to the boundedness of @xmath0 the existence of a tricritical point is excluded and the critical exponents are the mean field exponents , as expected .",
    "we derive the amplitudes of the power laws of order parameter and susceptibility in closed form in terms of @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude ratio of the susceptibilities just above and below the critical point is universal as expected by analogy with equilibrium second order phase transitions .",
