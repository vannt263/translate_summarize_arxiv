    "while new algorithms  @xcite are pushing the frontier of quantum computation , their practical implementation requires novel ideas for the design of qubits which can cope with the contradictory constraints of scalability and long decoherence time .",
    "solid state electronics offers scalability but involves macroscopic elementary blocks which usually interact strongly with the environment and , thus , suffer from a short decoherence time .",
    "in contrast , atomic scale designs ( trapped atoms , photons in cavities , nuclear spins ) can be easily decoupled from the environment but are difficult to combine into large and complex devices .",
    "the ideal system for a qubit implementation is a macroscopic device with two quantum states decoupled from the environment which can be manufactured and combined with others by conventional techniques .",
    "this ideal is closely approximated by the superconducting phase qubit ( scpq ) that consists of a frustrated josephson junction circuit @xcite with two states distinguished _ mostly _ by their superconducting phases .",
    "the simplest example of such a circuit is a _ low inductance _",
    "squid loop consisting of three ( or more ) josephson junctions frustrated by a magnetic field that creates a flux @xmath2 through the loop@xcite , see fig .  1",
    ". the two states of the qubit are defined by the phase changing clockwise or counterclockwise around the loop .",
    "the advantage of an  all phase \" design is that the superconducting phase is not directly coupled to the classical environment ; furthermore , superconductors themselves have a gap such that the environment has a low density of low energy modes potentially leading to decoherence and the charge fluctuations are screened such that the electric coupling to the environment is negligible .",
    "the magnetic coupling to the environment can not be completely avoided as the phase changing around the frustrated loop is coupled to an induced current , however , the latter can be made small if the josephson junctions are weak and the loop inductance is small . in particular",
    ", we shall show that the interaction of these currents with the environment leads to a small decoherence even if the environment includes potentially dangerous normal wires .",
    "finally , we note that the coupling with the frustrating magnetic field present in the simplest design can be eliminated in designs involving @xmath3-wave superconductors@xcite or @xmath4junctions@xcite .",
    "the first problem to be addressed in the development of a scpq is the implementation of a convenient probe which tests whether the device produces coherent rabi oscillations .",
    "it is obviously difficult to test a system which is decoupled from the environment and it is even more difficult to check that it remains in the phase coherent state without disturbing it . here",
    "we suggest an experiment to probe the state of such qubits and to determine their decoherence time . the idea is to measure the andreev conductance between the ground and a normal wire in the geometry of a fork with the two prongs connecting to two separate islands of the qubit ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "if the qubit phase is fixed ( classical regime ) , the low-@xmath5 conductance exhibits a contribution from processes in which electrons from the normal metal are reflected as holes from the qubit boundary , diffuse to the bulk superconductor boundary and are reflected from it as electrons .",
    "such a phase coherent electron diffusion in the normal metal prongs of the `` fork '' leads to periodic conductance oscillations ( with period @xmath6 ) as a function of the magnetic flux penetrating through the @xmath7 region of the fork.@xcite this is due to the fact that the magnetic field controls the superconducting phase difference between the two ns contacts of the fork [ ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig .  1 ] and thus influences the electron interference picture .",
    "a similar mechanism controls the experiment discussed in the quantum regime when the phase of the qubit fluctuates .",
    "qualitatively , at small bias voltage the quantum phase acquired by the reflected electrons fluctuates and the resulting contribution to the conductivity averages out . at larger voltages",
    "the phase fluctuations become slow compared with the electron tunneling time and the contribution to the conductivity is restored . below",
    "we describe the specific device parameters and derive quantitative formulas describing this effect .",
    "a similar proposal  to probe the josephson splitting of levels in a superconducting single cooper - pair transistor by measuring the andreev conductance  was put forward in ref .  .",
    "consider the squid loop with four junctions shown in fig .  1 .",
    "two degenerate states naturally appear in such a loop if the flux @xmath8 of the external field through the qubit loop is exactly @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , in a gauge with @xmath10 , @xmath11 the classical minima of the josephson energy correspond to the phase drops @xmath12 or @xmath13 around the loop ; in these states the phase of the island @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is @xmath15 ( relative to the phase at point @xmath12 ) ; below we refer to these states as @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in order to reduce the parasitic coupling to the environment ,",
    "the inductance @xmath18 of the loop should be sufficiently small so that @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the critical current . in the absence of any charging energy in the junctions the system prepared in one of these states",
    "will stay put forever ; quantum effects are due to the small but finite charging energy @xmath21 determined by the capacitances @xmath22 of the junctions , which should be smaller than the josephson energy @xmath23 .",
    "the tunnelling frequency between the two classically degenerate ground states is estimated as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the josephson plasma frequency of the contacts ; the coefficient @xmath26 was found by a numerical evaluation of the saddle - point trajectory in the space of the three phase variables @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "we assume values of @xmath20 in the range @xmath30 a , and capacitances of order of a few ff , resulting in @xmath31 ghz and a tunneling frequency @xmath32 in the range of few ghz .",
    "our choice of parameters is limited by the following constraints : ( a ) the system should be sufficiently small to fulfill the condition @xmath33 , but not too small , since ( b ) we need @xmath34 ; finally , ( c ) @xmath35 should not be too small , in order to keep the decoherence time @xmath36 much longer than @xmath37 .",
    "once tunnelling is taken into account , the true eigenstates become @xmath38/\\sqrt{2}$ ] and @xmath39/\\sqrt{2}$ ] and are separated by the energy gap @xmath40 ( here and below we shall use the  spin \" notation to describe the _ classically _ degenerate states ) .",
    "the deviation of the magnetic flux @xmath41 through the loop from the point @xmath42 removes the degeneracy of the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "thus the intrinsic hamiltonian of our qubit written in the basis @xmath43 is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46 .",
    "all operations on the qubit can be performed if one is able to vary the effective fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the variation of @xmath47 can be achieved by changing the flux @xmath8 in the loop , while the variation of @xmath48 can be implemented by two means : the variation of the gate potential applied to the island @xmath14 changes this field smoothly ( c.f . , ref .  ) , while switching a capacitor @xmath49 in parallel blocks the tunneling abruptly .",
    "the coupling of a two - level quantum system to the environment is usually described by the caldeira - leggett  spin - boson \" model where the  spin \" ( i.e. , two - level system , tls ) is linearly coupled to an ensemble of oscillators.@xcite actually , our tls originates from the dynamics of a continuous phase variable @xmath50 with a potential energy @xmath51 strongly favoring values @xmath50 around @xmath52 . then the term that describes the coupling to the environment can be written , upon integration over environmental modes , in the form of a non - local imaginary - time action @xmath53 ^ 2 $ ] . while in a superconducting system we can hope the low energy spectrum of the environment to be gapped providing favorable conditions for a long coherence time , here , we analyze the ( worst case ) situation where the coupling of low lying modes survives to produce a finite ohmic dissipation with @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the generalized  friction coefficient \" in the equation of motion @xmath56 .",
