    "in recent years , several studies have been carried out on the radio spectral properties of extra - galactic high - frequency selected radio sources .",
    "sadler et al . ( 2006 ) presented the general properties of a sample of radio sources with flux densities above 100 mjy obtained as part of the pilot 20  ghz survey ( at20 g ) undertaken with the australia telescope compact array ( ricci et al .",
    "2004 ) . with the use of a radio `` two - colour diagram '' , first used in the radio band by kesteven et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , they characterized the spectral properties of the high - frequency radio sources and confirmed the diversity of the radio spectra and the difficulty of predicting high - frequency properties by extrapolating the results of surveys observed at lower frequencies ( see also tucci et al . 2008 and massardi et al .",
    "2008 ) . considering the two classical radio source populations ( extended steep - spectrum and compact flat - spectrum sources ) , sadler et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that roughly 87 per cent of the high - frequency selected sources are flat - spectrum and 13 per cent are steep - spectrum .",
    "tucci et al . ( 2008 ) performed a multifrequency spectral analysis of a sample of radio sources observed with the very small array ( vsa ) at 33 ghz exploiting existing data at different frequencies down to 1.4 ghz .",
    "one of the most interesting results they found is that the majority of 33  ghz - selected sources show flatter spectra going to higher frequency ( about 50 per cent of the sample ) or become inverted ( about 19 per cent of the sample ) .",
    "this contradicts the standard models for high - frequency source spectra , which predict a spectral steepening due to the ageing of high - energy electrons .",
    "the result they found is completely consistent with the `` unified model '' for agn : the steep - spectrum component , which arises from extended radio lobes , rapidly decreases with frequency , while the compact emission starts to dominate at frequency @xmath2 1  ghz if the radio jet axis lies enough close to the line of sight .",
    "the difficulty of predicting high - frequency flux densities from the extrapolation of lower frequency data is testified by the significant number of sources found at high frequency that were not predicted .",
    "the percentage of these `` unexpected '' sources is observed to steadily increase with frequency : 10 per cent at 15  ghz ( taylor et al .",
    "2001 ) , 18 per cent at 20  ghz ( sadler et al . 2006 ) and 32 per cent at 33 ghz ( tucci et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the analysis of the radio spectral properties of 320 bright extragalactic radio sources with flux density @xmath3500  mjy at 20  ghz extracted from the at20 g was discussed in massardi et al .",
    "in this sample , spectral steepening is a common feature that becomes more prominent at higher frequencies , even if flat and inverted spectrum objects still dominate the sample .    in a more recent paper , prandoni",
    "et al ( 2010 ) studied the radio properties of a faint sample ( s @xmath30.6 mjy ) , selected at lower frequency ( 5  ghz ) and associated with early - type galaxies , finding strong spectral similarities with the massardi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) sample and suggesting that faint radio galaxies are mostly counterparts of the brighter ones , with no significant influence introduced by different flux limits and frequency selection .",
    "massardi et al .",
    "( 2011a ) analysed the full sample release ( fsr , murphy et al .",
    "2010 ) of the at20 g survey , which is 91 per cent complete above 100  mjy and 79 per cent complete above 50  mjy , and found that the high - frequency bright source sample is dominated by flat - spectrum sources , while the fraction of steep - spectrum sources increases with decreasing flux density .",
    "these results have also been confirmed by procopio et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who observed 263 sources , selected at 23  ghz in the wmap maps , at 5 , 8 and 22  ghz almost simultaneously to the observations performed between 30 and 857  ghz by the european space agency planck satellite ( tauber et al .",
    "the optical properties of the at20 g full sample presented in mahony et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who used supercosmos ( hambly et al . 2001 ) for optical identification and the 6df galaxy survey ( jones et al . 2009 ) or the literature for redshifts , showed that the sources which accrete cold gas have steeper radio spectral indices with respect to the sources that accrete hot gas .",
    "this behaviour suggests that the radio emission in sources with cold - mode accretion is dominated by the jets .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of flat- and steep - spectrum sources for the objects with no identification ( blank field ) is very different to that observed in the spectroscopic sample ; in fact the percentage of blank fields increases dramatically at steep spectral indices .",
    "the authors suggested that this increase could indicate a population of high - z ultra - steep - spectrum sources .    in recent papers ,",
    "massardi et al . ( 2011b ) and bonavera et al .",
    "( 2011 ) presented the planck australia telescope compact array co - eval observations ( paco ) , which provided two complete samples of flux density - selected sources : a bright sample ( @xmath4 500 mjy ) and a faint sample ( @xmath4 200 mjy ) with extensive multi - frequency coverage ( 540  ghz ) .",
    "the spectral analysis showed no significant differences between the two samples .",
    "the steepening of the sources at high frequencies is confirmed .",
    "the main difference is a larger fraction of steep - spectrum sources in the faint sample , mostly at the expense of peaked- and flat - spectrum sources . in a subsequent paper , bonaldi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) presented a detailed analysis of a complete sample of 69 sources spectrally - selected from the at20 g sample as those having inverted or upturning spectra and observed in the framework of the paco project .",
    "most of the source spectra ( 85 per cent ) are smooth and well described by a double power - law , while the remaining sources have complex spectra .",
    "the majority of the radio sources are likely blazars probably caught during a bright phase at 20  ghz .",
    "gawroski et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also investigated the dependence of spectral index distribution on flux density for a sample of 57 sources detected at 30  ghz with the ocra prototype receiver at the 32-m toru radio telescope above a flux density limit of 5 mjy .",
    "they found that the proportion of steep spectrum sources increases with decreasing flux density .",
    "they found no evidence for an unexpected population of sources above their completeness limit of 10 mjy whose spectra rise towards higher frequencies .    peel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) measured the 30  ghz flux densities of 605 radio sources from the combined radio all - sky target eight - ghz survey ( crates ) with the same instrumentation as gawroski et al .",
    "they studied the radio spectra between 1.4 and 30  ghz and found that 75 per cent have steepened at @xmath5 compared with @xmath6 , 6 per cent of the sources show a ghz - peaked spectrum shape with a peak between 4.8 and 8.4  ghz , 10 per cent of the sources are flat or rising and another 10 per cent are inverted .",
    "kurinsky et al .",
    "( 2013 ) reported the multi - frequency observations ( 4.843.3 ghz ) of 89 sources with 37  ghz flux density @xmath3 1 jy carried out with the vla / jvla .",
    "the sample contains a much higher fraction ( 42 per cent ) of flat - spectrum sources compared to 510 per cent of sources found in other samples selected at lower frequency .",
    "this sample extends the radio spectral energy distribution of the radio sources in the 5857  ghz regime .    in this paper",

    "during the years 20102011 , the medicina 32-m dish hosted the seven - feed 1826.5  ghz receiver built for the sardinia radio telescope , with the aim of performing its commissioning .",
    "this opportunity was exploited to carry out a pilot survey at 20  ghz over the sky region north of @xmath11 .",
    "this survey produced a catalogue of 73 confirmed sources down to a flux density limit of 115 mjy , which can be considered complete above 200 mjy .",
    "the 73 confirmed sources come from a selected list of 151 candidates chosen from the brighter and more reliable targets for the 20  ghz follow - up .",
    "for this reason the sample analysed in this paper is referred to as the knows 20  ghz bright sample .",
    "a more detailed description is provided in paper  i.    precise 20  ghz flux densities and position measurements were derived for all sources through 20  ghz follow - up observations , carried out at the 32-m medicina telescope , in the framework of the multi - frequency ( 5 , 8 , 20 , 30  ghz ) study of the sample .",
    "the medicina 20  ghz follow - up observations are described in detail in paper  i. here we focus on the 5/8  ghz medicina observations and on the 30  ghz observations carried out at the toru telescope .",
    "follow - up observations of the knows bright sample were performed with the 32-m medicina telescope on dec 11@xmath12 , 12@xmath12 and 13@xmath12 2010 in the frequency ranges 55.15  ghz and 8.188.33  ghz .",

    "for comparison , the angular resolution at 20  ghz is 1.7 arcmin .",
    "data were recorded into fits files .",
    "they were then flagged in order to discard scans clearly affected by radio frequency interference and/or severe atmospheric disturbances .",
    "the data were flux - calibrated according to the absolute flux density scale by ott et al .",
    "the ra and dec cross - scans were then stacked for each target source in order to improve the s / n ratio of the detections by decreasing the rms noise .",
    "the stacked cross - scan was gaussian - fitted in order to obtain flux density and positional offsets in ra and dec .",
    "the positional offsets were then used to correct the flux density for the signal attenuation caused by the primary beam profile . a thorough description of the aforementioned calibration and fitting procedures ( performed with the data reduction package oscar , procopio et al . 2011 ) , together with the error analysis for the flux density measurements are provided in paper  i.    of the 73 sources , 60 ( 82 per cent ) and 57 ( 78 per cent ) were detected at 5 and 8  ghz respectively .",
    "non - detections at 5/8  ghz were mainly due to the limited sensitivity of the receivers , which were not properly cooled down at the time of observations .",

    "the long time lag between the 1.4 ghz observations and the higher frequency ones ( 17 years ) is not troublesome because at lower frequencies most of the emission comes from radio lobes which are more stable than radio cores .    in this paper",
    "we are interested only to the statistical behaviour of spectral indices in the sample . in this case",
    "positive and negative variations caused by short - term variability tend to cancel out .",

    "the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ; _ http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/_ ) was then used to identify the radio source optical counterparts , to find redshifts and to obtain optical types within a search radius of 1 arcmin to the 20  ghz knows follow - up positions . in cases of multiple counterparts we chose the one which matched the nvss flux density and position information .",
    "we also extracted the information on the optical class , b@xmath25 and r@xmath26 magnitude from the supercosmos sky surveys database ( sss ; _ http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/index.html_ ) .",
    "we again allowed for a 1-arcmin wide search box and in cases of multiple counterparts we chose the entry with the minimum distance from the follow - up 20  ghz radio position .",
    "the optical and redshift information of the knows sample is summarized in table  [ tab : optid ] .    according to ned we have 36 qsos ( 49 per cent ) , 17 galaxies ( 23 per cent ) and one planetary nebula , while 19 objects ( 36 per cent ) have no optical types . in supercosmos , 18 objects ( 25 per cent ) show galaxy appearance ( class 1 ) , 51 ( 70 per cent ) a stellar appearance ( class 2 ) , one ( the planetary nebula ) is noisy ( class=4 ) and 3 objects ( 4 per cent ) have no supercosmos identification .",
    "for the 19 sources that have no optical type in ned we use the supercosmos classification , when available .",

    "the comparison with the paco bright sample ( massardi et al .",
    "2011b ) , estimated with the source selection applied here to the spectral indices calculated on their best epoch fit of the sed between 4.5 and 40 ghz , clearly shows the higher fraction of flat spectrum sources dominating the population of sources selected above 200 mjy , while at our flux density limit the steep spectrum objects become more significant .",
    "the fractions in the remaining sub - populations are comparable .",
    "it is also worth noticing that all the remaining sources in the up - turn quadrant are classified as flat in table  [ tab : at20 g ] .",
    "in this paper we presented the results of the multi - frequency follow - up observations of the k - band northern wide survey ( knows ) pilot project .",

    "16 objects have a counterpart in the 30 ghz planck ercsc .",
    "planck and toru 30 ghz flux densities are in reasonable agreement , indicating that our flux densities are not systematically biased .",
    "the objects were identified through ned and supercosmos as radiogalaxies ( 27 per cent ) and qsos ( 68 per cent ) in agreement with previous works ( e.g. sadler et al .",
    "two objects have no optical i d and one is a planetary nebula .    42 ( 58 per cent ) out of the 72 extragalactic objects have a redshift measurement : 30 are qsos and 12 are radiogalaxies . for 34 objects ( 24 qsos and 10 radiogalaxies )",
    "we computed the optical and radio luminosity .",
    "as expected , qsos are found on average at higher redshift than radiogalaxies and are intrinsically brighter both in the radio and the optical band .",
    "four spectral indices in four contiguous frequency ranges were calculated : @xmath47 ; @xmath39 ; @xmath38 and @xmath48 . a clear steepening trend is visible both in the mean and median of the spectral indices when moving from lower to higher frequency ranges , a behaviour that is in agreement with what was found by massardi et al .",

    "we used radio colour - colour plots to compare the radio spectral properties of radio sources of different populations with the ones found in other high - frequency selected catalogues .",
    "radiogalaxies mostly appear in the two lower quadrants ( corresponding to the steep - spectrum and gps - like classes ) while qsos are more scattered around the centre of the diagram indicating a prevalent flat radio spectrum : qsos are therefore more easily singled out in high frequency selected surveys .",
    "our sample appears to be in substantial agreement with the at20 g fsr source population statistics when the latter sample is cut to the same flux density limit ( 100 mjy ) .",
