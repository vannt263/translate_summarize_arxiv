    "a standard assumption underlying evolutionary game dynamics , regardless of whether a player is social agent or gene , is that players tend to imitate successful others . in actual social evolutionary dynamics",
    ", however , there may be zealous players that stick to one option according to their idiosyncratic preferences regardless of the payoff that they or their peers earn .",
    "collective social dynamics in the presence of zealots started to be examined for non - game situations such as the voter model representing competition between two equally strong opinions ( i.e. , neutral invasions ) @xcite .",
    "zealots seem to be also relevant in evolutionary game dynamics .",
    "for example , voluntary immunization behavior of individuals when epidemic spreading possibly occurs in a population can be examined by a public - goods dilemma game @xcite . in this situation",
    ", some individuals may behave as zealot such that they try to immunize themselves regardless of the cost of immunization @xcite .    in our previous work",
    ", we examined evolutionary dynamics the prisoner s dilemma and snowdrift games in infinite populations with zealots @xcite .",
    "specifically , we assumed zealous cooperators and asked the degree to which the zealous cooperators facilitate cooperation in the entire population .",
    "we showed that cooperation prevails if the temptation of unilateral defection is weak or the selection strength is weak . for the prisoner s dilemma",
    ", we analytically obtained the condition of cooperation .    in the present paper ,",
    "we conduct a finite population analysis of evolutionary dynamics of a general two - person game with zealots .",
    "evolutionary games in finite populations have been recognized as a powerful analytical tool for understanding properties of evolutionary games such as conditions of cooperation in social dilemma games .",
    "in addition , the outcome for finite populations is often different from that for infinite populations @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of this method to understand evolutionary dynamics of games with zealots for general matrix games .",
    "it should be noted that the fixation probability , i.e. , the probability that a given strategy eventually dominates the population as a result of stochastic evolutionary dynamics , is a primary quantity to be pursued in evolutionary dynamics in finite populations .",
    "in contrast , fixation trivially occurs in the presence of zealots if all the zealots are assumed to take the same strategy ; the zealots strategy always fixates .",
    "for example , if there is a single zealous cooperator in the population , cooperation always fixates even in the conventional prisoner s dilemma game .",
    "however , in this adverse case , fixation of cooperation is expected to take long time ; the relevant question here is the fixation time @xcite . in this study",
    ", we examine the mean fixation time of the strategy selected by the zealots .",
    "this quantity serves as a probe to understand the extent to which zealots influence non - zealous players in the population .",
    "the fixation time would be affected by the payoff matrix , population size , number of zealous players , strength of selection .",
    "mathematically , we extend the approach taken in @xcite to the case with zealots .",
    "we assume a well - mixed population of @xmath0 players under evolutionary dynamics defined as follows . in each discrete time unit",

    "each player plays a symmetric two - person game with all the other @xmath3 players in a unit time .",
    "the payoff matrix of the single game for the row player is given by @xmath4 the fitness of a player on which the selection pressure operates is defined as the payoff summed over the @xmath3 opponents .",
    "we assume that @xmath5 players may flip the strategy according to the moran process @xcite .",
    "we call these players the ordinary players .",
    "the other @xmath6 players are zealots that never change the strategy irrespectively of their fitness . because our primary interest is in the possibility of cooperation in social dilemma games induced by zealous cooperators",
    ", we assume that all the zealots take strategy @xmath1 ; @xmath1 is identified with cooperation in the case of a social dilemma game .",
    "we also assume that @xmath7 for the moran process to be well - defined .",
    "because we have assumed a well - mixed population , the state of the evolutionary process is specified by the number of ordinary players selecting @xmath1 , which we denote by @xmath8 . in each time step",
    ", we select an ordinary player with the equal probability @xmath9 . the strategy of the selected player is updated .",
    "then , we select a player , called the parent , whose strategy replaces that of the previously selected player . the parent is selected with the probability proportional to the fitness among the @xmath0 players including the zealots and the player whose strategy is to be replaced .",
    "the population size @xmath5 is constant over time .",
    "it should be noted that a player is updated once on average in time @xmath5 .    because the zealots always select @xmath1 , the moran process ends up with the unanimous population of @xmath1 players ( we impose @xmath10 for this to be true ) . in other words ,",
    "fixation of @xmath1 always occurs such that the issue of fixation probability is irrelevant to our model .",
    "we calculate the mean fixation time and its approximation in the case of a large population size by extending the framework developed in @xcite ( also see @xcite ) .",

    "we extended the results for the fixation time under the moran process @xcite to the case of a population with zealous players .",
    "similar to the case without zealots @xcite , we identified three regimes in terms of the payoff matrix , number of zealots , and selection strengths .",
    "in one regime , the fixation time is small ( i.e. , @xmath127 ) . in the other two regimes , it is large ( i.e. , @xmath226 with @xmath140 ) .",
    "we illustrated our results with representative games including the prisoner s dilemma game , snowdrift game , and coordination game .",
    "zealots have several impacts on evolutionary dynamics in finite populations .",
    "first , fixation of one strategy @xmath1 always occurs with zealots because we assumed that all zealots permanently take @xmath1 .",
    "second , there is a case in which fixation is fast if the fraction of @xmath1 players is sufficiently large , whereas fixation is slow if the fraction of @xmath1 is small .",
    "this scenario occurs for the coordination game . in the absence of zealots ,",
    "the same game shows bistability such that the fixation to the unanimity of @xmath1 or that of @xmath2 occurs fast @xcite .",
    "third , for a selection strength smaller than a threshold value , the fixation is fast for any payoff matrix . in the absence of zealots ,",
    "the dependence of the mean fixation time on @xmath5 for large @xmath5 values is completely determined by the signs of @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the scaling of the mean fixation time on @xmath5 is independent of the selection strength because manipulating the selection strength does not change the sign of the effective @xmath92 or @xmath93 value .",
    "if the payoff matrix is given in the slow fixation regime , the fixation is exponentially slow even for a small selection strength .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of zealots , slow fixation can be accelerated if we lessen the selection strength .",
    "mobilia examined the prisoner s dilemma game with cooperation facilitators @xcite .",
    "a cooperation facilitator was assumed to cooperate with cooperators and not to play with defectors .",
    "the cooperation facilitator and zealous cooperator in the present study are common in that they never change the strategy .",
    "however , they are different . first , zealous cooperators are embedded in a well - mixed population such that they myopically cooperate with defectors as well as cooperators .",
    "second , the ordinary players may imitate the zealous cooperator s strategy ( i.e. , cooperation ) .",
    "in contrast , players do not imitate the cooperation facilitator s strategy ( i.e. , cooperation ) in mobilia s model . as a consequence , cooperation does not always fixate in his model .",
    "examination of the case of imperfect zealots , in which zealots change the strategy with a small probability @xcite , warrants future work .",
