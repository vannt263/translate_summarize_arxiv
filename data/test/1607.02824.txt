    "consensus seeking over complex networks has played a foundational role in the development of distributed computation and networked control systems @xcite . how a set of isolated processors communicating only by means of two - party messages reach a common state in the presence of faulty nodes was a prior concern for fault - tolerant distributed computation @xcite .",
    "distributed controller design that drives a network of autonomous agents to certain consensus state such as the network average or some leader s state @xcite turned out to be a primary step towards control , estimation , and optimization of networked control systems @xcite . in the past decades , tremendous research efforts have been devoted to efficient design and convergence analysis of consensus and synchronization algorithms motivated by various social , engineering , and physical systems , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "in particular , consensus over quantum networks where node states are in quantum space and algorithms must be implemented by feasible quantum means has drawn attention @xcite .",
    "quantum particles ( subsystems ) can be interconnected by local environments which are by themselves also quantum systems , the resulting state evolution will lead to a symmetric state consensus over such a quantum network , a concept introduced in @xcite .",
    "the reduced states of the nodes will in turn asymptotically tend to the average of the nodes initial reduced states , in the almost sure sense along the discrete algorithm proposed in @xcite and deterministically along the master equation approach proposed in @xcite .",
    "such methods are essentially coherent quantum control for open quantum systems @xcite , where the involved local environments can only be engineered at a small scale . on the other hand , many types of quantum networks , especially quantum communication networks , are hybrid in the sense that both quantum and classical parts co - exist @xcite . quantum operations ( often being measurements ) can be performed locally and then the outcomes of the measurements are exchanged via classical communications , leading to the so - called local - operation classical - communication ( locc ) networks which have served as protocols for quantum cryptography or potential tools for engineering complex quantum states @xcite .",
    "measurement - based quantum control has also been demonstrated as effective means of manipulating quantum states both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a consensus seeking problem over a quantum hybrid network consisting of a number of nodes each holding a qubit , where projective measurements are applied and the measurement results are exchanged . the problem of centralized optimal path planning for the network with all - to - all classical communications is shown to be a stochastic optimal control problem , whose computation and communication complexities are analyzed .",
    "we also develop a distributed pairwise qubit projection ( pqp ) algorithm , where pairs of nodes meet at a given time and respectively perform measurements at their geometric average .",
    "the qubit states are driven to a consensus almost surely along the proposed pqp algorithm .",
    "the expected qubit density operators actually converge to the average of the network s initial values , consistent with the work of @xcite for open quantum networks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] presents some basic preliminaries on quantum states and measurements , and then introduces the considered hybrid quantum network model .",
    "section [ sec3 ] and section [ sec4 ] investigate centralized and distributed solutions to the considered qubit agreement problem , respectively . finally a few concluding remarks are given in section [ sec5 ]",
    "in this section , we first present some preliminaries on quantum states and quantum measurements @xcite , and then introduce the hybrid quantum network model under investigation .",
    "the state space associated with any isolated quantum system is a complex vector space with inner product , i.e. , a hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "the system is completely described by its state vector , which is a unit vector in the system s state space and often denoted by @xmath1 known as the dirac notation . for an open quantum system , its state",
    "can also be described by a positive ( i.e. , positive semi - definite ) hermitian density operator @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the inner product equipped by the hilbert space @xmath0 .",
    "under dirac notion this inner product is written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the dual vector of @xmath7 .",
    "a quantum state @xmath1 , induces a density operator , namely @xmath8 by @xmath9 density operators provide a convenient description of _ mixed states _ as ensembles of pure states : if a quantum system is in state @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 where @xmath12 , its density operator is @xmath13 any positive and hermitian operator with trace one defines a proper density operator describing certain quantum state , and vice versa .",
    "a projective measurement is described by an _",
    "observable _ being a hermitian operator over the state space @xmath0 of the system being observed .",
    "let the dimension of @xmath0 be @xmath14 and let @xmath15 be an observable with nondegenerate spectrum , i.e. , the eigenvalues @xmath16 of @xmath15 are distinct .",
    "let @xmath17 be the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath16 of @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "as @xmath15 is hermitian , @xmath17 form a complete basis of the hilbert space @xmath0 . consequently",
    ", @xmath18 can be written as @xmath19 where the @xmath20 are complex numbers satisfying @xmath21 .",
    "let a system be prepared in state @xmath18 where the measurement @xmath15 is performed .",
    "then the outcome of such measurement is random taking value in @xmath22 , for which the probability of observe outcome @xmath23 is @xmath24 moreover , the state after the measurement becomes @xmath25 if @xmath23 is observed .",
    "let a network of nodes be indexed in the set @xmath26 .",
    "each node holds a qubit , i.e. , a quantum system whose state space @xmath0 is a two - dimensional hilbert space .",

    "projective measurements can be performed at the individual qubits , respectively .",
    "an available projective measurement @xmath29 is described by its two eigenstates @xmath30 and @xmath31 we assume that the measurements are in the set @xmath32 the outcomes of a measurement @xmath29 are indexed by @xmath33 , corresponding to eigenstate @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , corresponding to eigenstate @xmath36 . for the ease of presentation we will sometimes identify a measurement in the set @xmath37 with its angle @xmath38 since there is a natural one - to - one correspondence between the elements in @xmath37 and angles in the interval @xmath39 .",

    "we give an example of the considered hybrid quantum network with @xmath50 nodes in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "in this section , we investigate the scenario when the nodes are equipped with all - to - all classical communications and derive the optimal rules for measurement sequence selections at the qubits .",
    "we stack the states of the qubits into an @xmath51 dimensional column vector by @xmath52 .",

    "the measurement selection decision is denoted by @xmath59 where the @xmath60 assigning the value of @xmath61 .",
    "the decision @xmath60 can depend on all information available by the time slot @xmath62 : @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "formally we have @xmath67 with @xmath68 can be an arbitrary function that takes values in @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "all such decisions @xmath71 are put in a set @xmath72 .    for any fixed measurement decision @xmath71 , the agreement displacement at time @xmath73 is characterized by the expected network fidelity : @xmath74 where @xmath75 captures all randomness generated by the quantum measurements as well as possible random measurement decisions .",
    "the evolution of node states is governed by the quantum measurement principles and can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 . by plain calculation",
    "we can further write @xmath81 here we have identified @xmath82 and @xmath48 with their angles .",
    "note that , the value and distribution of @xmath83 is fully determined by @xmath84 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is to say @xmath85 is markovian .",
    "finding the policy @xmath71 that miximizes @xmath86 is a stochastic optimal control problem @xcite .",
    "the optimal policy @xmath87 that maximizes @xmath86 can be obtained as follows .",
    "clearly @xmath87 is markovian in the sense that @xmath65 depends only on @xmath85 for all @xmath88 in the decision profile @xmath87 .",
    "introduce @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "define a function @xmath91 by @xmath92 if @xmath78 and @xmath93 if @xmath80 .",
    "introduce the cost - to - go function @xmath94 defined by @xmath95 then by a standard dynamic programming argument there holds @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the boundary condition of ( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath99 the optimal decision @xmath87 is given by @xmath100 for @xmath88 .",
    "next , we consider an infinite horizon scenario when the optimality criteria is given by the minimal steps in expectation required for reaching a perfect agreement in the network .",
    "let @xmath101 be a measurement selection policy for the entire time horizon , where for any @xmath102 , @xmath60 maps to @xmath69 from all available information up to time @xmath103 .",
    "all such decisions are put in the set @xmath104 .",
    "consider the expected number of steps of reaching agreement at the qubits : @xmath105 clearly there exist simple policies in @xmath104 under which @xmath106 will be a finite number .",
    "we are interested in the optimal one that minimizes @xmath106 .",
    "recall the definition of @xmath107 .",
    "similarly , the optimal policy @xmath87 that minimizes @xmath106 is markovian .",
    "in fact , it is also stationary in the sense that @xmath108 for all @xmath109 .",
    "define cost - to - go function @xmath110 in this case the function @xmath111 satisfies the following equation @xcite @xmath112 the optimal decision @xmath87 is given by @xmath113      we would like to point out that the derived optimal network - level rules are conceptually equivalent to the single qubit framework presented in @xcite . although the centralized optimal solutions are clear in theory for both finite and infinite time horizons , it is important to understand the amount of computation and communication resources required for implementing them in practice for a considerably large network .",
    "the bellman equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) involve a continuous action set @xmath69 .",
    "usually this is approximated by a proper discretization of @xmath37 into a finite set .",
    "for example , we can let the measurements be selected from @xcite @xmath114 this of course means that the resulting policy becomes potentially suboptimal due to smaller action space .",
    "however it is reasonable to believe that a large @xmath115 would produce policies that can approximate the optimal solution .",
    "suppose @xmath37 has been discretized into a finite set with @xmath115 elements .",
    "note that this means that the state space @xmath46 for each qubit is also discretized with @xmath116 elements .",
    "we now discuss the finite horizon case in detail . from the computational side , solving the bellman equation ( [ 1 ] ) relies on recursively along the equation ( [ 1 ] ) computing @xmath117 ( and therefore obtain the optimal @xmath118 ) from @xmath119 for all @xmath120 and all @xmath97 , starting with the boundary condition @xmath121 the number of algebraic operations required in such process inevitably grows faster than @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , practically it is almost impossible to numerically solve the bellman equation ( [ 1 ] ) and obtain the optimal policy for a large network .",
    "in fact , even if the computation can be done off line , preserving the optimal policy relies on @xmath123 bits of memory . since each node relies on the states of all other nodes to carry out the optimal policy , the network requires all - to - all communications with @xmath124 bits of transmissions per step .",
    "in this section , we discuss distributed solutions to the considered qubit consensus problem in the sense that nodes communicate with a few neighbours locally and then make measurement selection decisions individually .",
    "we assume that there is a connected underlying graph @xmath125 with node set @xmath126 and edge set @xmath127 representing the classical communication links among the nodes , where a link @xmath128 specifies that nodes @xmath43 and @xmath129 can exchange information their states .",
    "we denote @xmath130 as the neighbour set of node @xmath43 .",
    "we also define @xmath131 and @xmath132    we propose the following algorithm .    * pairwise qubit projection ( pqp)*. ( i ) at each @xmath44 , a node @xmath43 is drawn uniformly at random from the set @xmath126 , and then node @xmath129 is selected uniformly at random from the set @xmath133 ; ( ii ) the selected pair of nodes @xmath43 and @xmath129 exchanges their current states @xmath48 and @xmath134 ; ( iii ) nodes @xmath43 and @xmath129 apply projective measurements @xmath135 and all other nodes keep their current states .",
    "we remark that the above algorithm is clearly inspired by the class of gossiping algorithms for classical communication networks and open quantum networks @xcite .",
    "this proposed algorithm can be realized in fully distributed manner in the sense that nodes even need not to share a common clock and can simply follow independent poisson processes to wake up @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pair section process can also be made deterministic and multiple disjoint pairs can be selected at a given time , which will not change the nature of the algorithm and actually can speed up the algorithm .",
    "the involved projective measurements introduce new type of randomness in the algorithm , which makes the pqp algorithm differ from the previous algorithms @xcite at a fundamental level .",
    "let @xmath85 be driven by the proposed pqp algorithm .",
    "suppose node pair @xmath136 is selected at time @xmath44 .",
    "then from the quantum measurement postulate , independently among @xmath137 we have @xmath138 with probability @xmath139 , and @xmath140 with probability @xmath141 .",
    "the following result holds .",

    "all the outcomes of the projective measurements have to be read out for carrying out the algorithm .",
    "nonetheless @xmath152 describes the distribution of @xmath146 under the measure @xmath151 .",
