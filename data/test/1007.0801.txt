    "galactic black hole candidates ( bhcs ) are ideal objects in studying how accretion disks and coronae evolve due to changes in the accretion rate , thanks to their high photon statistics and frequent state transitions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "they are characterized by transient behavior , such as a sudden x - ray brightening caused by instabilities originating in the outer accretion disk . during the outburst , which typically lasts a few months",
    ", they may go through several distinct spectral states , initial low / hard state ( lhs ) , intermediate or very high state ( ims / vhs ) , high / soft state ( hss ) , lhs , then go back to quiescence .",
    "these states are believed to reflect changes in the geometry of the accretion disk and corona ( @xcite ) , as well as jet ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "bhcs sometimes show powerful radio jets in their outbursts in association with state transitions from the lhs to the hss .",
    "hence , study of the spectral transition and the disk - jet interaction is important in clarifying jet production mechanisms ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the new x - ray transient xte j1752223 was first detected at the 30 mcrab flux level in the 210 kev range on october 23 , 2009 during the galactic bulge monitoring with the proportional counter array ( pca ) of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) @xcite .",
    "on october 24 , the source also triggered the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) at a 100 mcrab flux in the 1550 kev range @xcite .",
    "the position was determined to ( ra , dec)=(17@xmath052@xmath115@xmath2.14 , 22@xmath32033.8 ) with 5 arc - sec uncertainty by a follow - up swift x - ray telescope ( xrt ) localization @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum is consistent with a power - law with photon index 1.38@xmath40.01 and the power spectrum shows band - limited noise with a total rms of @xmath530 percent , suggesting that the source was in a typical lhs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optical @xcite , near - infrared @xcite , and radio counterparts @xcite were also discovered within the x - ray error circle during the initial phase .",
    "possible double - sided jets were detected on february 11 , 2010 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; however , the bh mass , inclination angle , and distance have not been determined yet .    since august 3 , 2009 , the highly sensitive all - sky monitor , monitor of all - sky x - ray image , maxi(@xcite ) , has been activated on the exposed facility of the japanese experimental module `` kibo '' of the international space station ( iss ) . soon after the discovery of xte j1752223 , when the maxi was still in the commissioning phase , the source was found at the 30 mcrab level in an x - ray image of the maxi gas slit camera ( gsc ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "maxi / gsc also observed a rapid spectral softening on 2010 january 22 due to a spectral transition from the lhs to the hss ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maxi initial results are described in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we report on maxi gsc observations of xte j1752223 during its outburst since october 2009 . in the observation and result section , we demonstrate maxi s spectral performance for such a bright source .",
    "finally , we discuss the origin of the rather unusual behavior of xte j1752223 in the light curve and spectral hardness .",
    "the maxi carries two scientific instruments : the gsc and the solid state camera ( ssc ) .",
    "the gsc consists of twelve one - dimensional position - sensitive proportional counters operated in the 220 kev range , while the ssc is composed of 32 x - ray ccd cameras with an energy range of 0.512 kev .",
    "the gsc observes two different directions ( horizontal and zenithal direction ) with an instantaneous field of view of 3@xmath6160@xmath3 each covered by six cameras .",
    "it covers 70 percent of the whole sky in every orbit 32 times per day at maximum .",
    "both instruments have been working properly in orbit , but four out of the twelve gsc cameras are turned off due to discharges in the proportional counters .",
    "see @xcite for more details of the maxi . in this paper",
    ", we use only the gsc data , which offer a larger sky coverage and effective area than those of the ssc .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows two 1-month integrated x - ray sky images with a radius of 10 degrees centered on xte j1752223 in the 220 kev band .",
    "these false - color images are produced by superposing red ( 24 kev ) , green ( 410 kev ) , and blue ( 1020 kev ) images .",
    "data from all the counters were combined , and two images were made for two separate periods ( from december 20 , 2009 to january 19 , 2010 , and january 20 , 2010 to february 28 , 2010 ) .",
    "xte j1752223 is clearly detected in both gsc images .",
    "because of its location near the galactic center ( l , b)=(6.42 , 2.11 ) , many bright x - ray sources such as gx 9 + 1 , gx 51 , and gx 3 + 1 are visible in this field . the point spread function ( psf ) of the maxi / gsc",
    "is estimated at about 2.0 degrees ( fwhm ) in this energy range .",
    "the position of xte j1752223 determined by the gsc was consistent with the swift / xrt localization .",
    "we calculated net source counts by subtracting the background from the on - source data . to avoid the source contamination from the nearby bright sources gx 9 + 1 ( 2.82@xmath3 away ) and sax j1748.92021 in the globular cluster ngc 6440 ( @xcite ; 2.13@xmath3 away ) , we carefully selected the source and background regions as circles of 1.17-degree and 2.48-degree radius , respectively ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the extracted source counts were normalized by dividing by a total exposure ( in unit of @xmath7s ) obtained with a time integral of the collimator effective area .",
    "the crab nebula was analyzed in the same way , and the count rates of xtej 1752223 were normallized by the crab unit ( 1.30 , 1.25 , and 0.32 counts @xmath8 s@xmath9 in the 24 , 410 , and 1020 kev range ) .",
    "the 1-day averaged light curve of xte j1752223 thus obtained is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the gsc scans were performed approximately 10 times per day .",
    "a data gap from december 7th to 23th was due to solar avoidance limitation ( the current solar protection is set at above 4@xmath3 from the sun ) .",
    "the x - ray light curve shows the following notable features .",
    "there are two initial plateau phases that lasted for @xmath525 days and @xmath540 days , respectively , and the spectral hardness between them is slightly different : the second phase ( phase d in figure [ fig2 ] ) has a softer spectrum than the first one ( phase b ) . the source could not be observed during phase d by any other x - ray instruments except for rxte / asm and swift / bat due to the sun constraints .",
    "the time scales of the rising phases a and c were about 5 days and 15 days , respectively .",
    "another notable feature is the anti - correlated behavior around the peak : the 24 kev flux rapidly increased after january 20 , 2010 ( mjd : 55216 ) while fluxes in the other two bands and the swift / bat 1550 kev flux decreased ( phase e for @xmath5 9 days ) .",
    "the anti - correlation between the soft and hard bands indicates a spectral transition .",
    "this fact means that it took a very long time of @xmath5 90 days for the source to complete the transition after the onset of outburst .",
    "the 220 kev flux reached a peak on january 23 , 2010 ( mjd : 55219 ) at about the 430 mcrab level , then gradually decreased ( phase f ) .",
    "the emissions during phase f are dominated by the soft bands ( @xmath10 kev ) ( see also the lower panel of figure [ fig1 ] ) . around march 28 ( mjd : 55283 ) ,",
    "hard x - rays and the hardness ratio again increase ( phase g and h ) .",
    "the outburst continues at the time of writing this paper ( the end of may 2010 ) , and the current duration for the outburst is about 210 days .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a hardness - intensity diagram for the currently on - going outburst in xte j1752223 .",
    "because of the anti - correlated behavior between the soft and hard x - rays during phases e and g , the data points track the q - shaped curve , i.e. hysteresis behavior , as seen in other bhcs ( @xcite ) . the two plateau phases b and d",
    "correspond to the lhs , while the softer phase f corresponds with the hss .",
    "thus , the state transition from the lhs to the hss can be clearly identified with the maxi / gsc data alone .",
    "a color - color diagram is also shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "a line is plotted for a power - law spectral model with a photon index ( @xmath11 ) ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 modified by the absorption ( equivalent hydrogen column density n@xmath12=0.72@xmath1310@xmath14@xmath8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that the current gsc energy response gives systematic uncertainties of about 0.5@xmath15 @xmath8 and 0.1 in @xmath16 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "as the outburst proceeds , the @xmath11 continuously varies from @xmath51.5 to @xmath55.0 .",
    "the spectral shape during phases b+d and f are is approximated by a power - law with photon indices of 1.52.0 and above 3.5 , respectively .",
    "these estimated photon indices are roughly consistent with typical values found from bhcs in the lhs ( phase b+d ) and the hss ( phase f ) .",
    "the power - law index in phase e shows an intermediate value ( 2.03.0 ) between these seen in the lhs and the hss .",
    "an rxte - pointed observation carried out on january 19 , 2010 ( mjd : 55215 ) during phase e shows that the source was at least in the ims ( @xcite ) .",
    "detailed spectral parameters and their evolution in this outburst will be reported in a forthcoming paper ( yamaoka et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "we have presented the first results on the black hole candidate xte j1752223 in the current outburst from the maxi / gsc on the iss . judging from the light curve and spectral hardness ,",
    "we have found that the source was initially in the lhs with two long plateau phases ( b and d ) .",
    "after the long stay ( @xmath590 days ) in the lhs , it exhibited a spectral transition via the ims ( phase e ) into the hss around january 22 , 2010 ( phase f ) .",
    "the source came back to the lhs around april 3 , 2010 ( phase h ) , and the source flux is gradually declining toward the quiescent state .",
    "it should be noted that a relatively high level of radio emission was detected by the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) on january 21 , 2010 ( @xcite ) , just corresponding to the beginning of the spectral transition from the lhs to the hss . the gsc spectrum on this date is roughly represented by a power - law with a photon index of 2.53.0 ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) , suggesting that the source was probably in the ims .",
    "later , two separate radio sources were identified with high resolution imaging by the european vlbi network ( e - evn ) ( @xcite ) . if we interpret it as plasma ejection , it is consistent with the scenario that large - scale jets are produced in association with the spectral transition from the lhs to the hss .",
    "another important result is that the luminosities during the transition from the hss to the lhs , and from the lhs to the hss were not the same : the hard - to - soft transition happened at a 220 kev flux higher by a factor of about 7 than that at the soft - to - hard transition .",
    "such hysteresis behavior was first noticed for gs 112468 and gx 3394 ( @xcite , ) and has been well established for many bhcs .",
    "it means that the spectral transition is not controlled by the mass accretion rate alone , but depends on its history .",
    "most of the bhcs show a rapid flux rise within a few days that causes the near - instantaneous spectral transition ( @xcite ) , and then their fluxes decay with an e - folding time of several ten days into quiescence ( some bhcs show a secondary flare ) .",
    "it is known that the spectral state begins with the initial lhs , then evolves through the vhs / ims , hss , and lhs during an outburst .",
    "however , about 8 bhcs such as xte j1118 + 480 and gro j0422 + 32 remained in the lhs throughout their previous outbursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "the very long duration of the initial lhs in xte j1752223 and the two long plateau phases are rather uncommon for the bhc outbursts .",
    "meyer - hofmeister ( @xcite ) points out that systems with short orbital periods like xte j1118 + 480 ( 4.1 hours ) and gro j0422 + 32 ( 5.1 hours ) tend to have low peak luminosities in their outbursts ( and hence do not show state transition ) because smaller accretion disks have less accumulated matter .",
    "the long lhs observed in xte j1752223 might be related with a short orbital period . from our observations , however , xte j1752 - 223 also resembles gx 339 - 4 , which remained in the lhs for a long period before transition into the hss ( @xcite ) .",
    "gx 339 - 4 has a relatively long orbital period ( 1.7 days ) among bhcs categorized in low - mass x - ray binaries , indicating a larger accretion disk size . in this case , the unusually long duration of the lhs before the state transition would result from gradual change in the accretion rate .",
    "it is still unclear what causes the slow increase of the accretion rate in contrast with other x - ray novae .",
    "therefore , the determination of orbital period of xte j1752223 should be important to clarify the nature of the long lhs period .",
    "let us explain the overall picture of the light curve of the xte j1752 - 223 outburst .",
    "we assume the generally accepted disk truncation scenario in the lhs never though some other scenarios have been proposed for the lhs , e.g. @xcite , where the innermost radius of the disk ( @xmath17 ) is basically determined by the balance between the accretion rate and gas evaporation rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the lhs is the state where the accretion disk is truncated at a larger radius than the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco =3 schwarzschild radii for a non - rotating bh ) , due to a low accretion rate . as the accretion rate increases ( thin begins in an outer part of the accretion disk )",
    ", @xmath17 decreases .",
    "when the radius decreases , the corona around the disk cools down via efficient inverse compton scattering of the soft disk photons and exhibits softer x - ray spectra .",
    "thus , the two phases in the lhs ( b and d ) can be interpreted with a slightly higher accretion rate in phase d than that in phase b. furthermore , when the accretion rate eventually exceeds a critical rate required for the state transition , the gas evaporation will not be strong enough to truncate the disk .",
    "thus , @xmath17 reaches the isco , and the intense thermal radiation from the accretion disk , i.e. ultra - soft component , appears in soft x - rays ( phase f in the hss ) .",
    "the disk truncation scenario does not predict any time evolution of @xmath17 during the hss . as seen in the light curve with a very smooth decay during the hss ,",
    "the local accretion rate smoothly decreases with time .",
    "when it falls below the critical rate again , the source comes back to the lhs ( phase h ) .",
    "the significant increase mainly in the 24 kev band suggests that the disk innermost temperature ( @xmath18 ) is relatively low .",
    "preliminary fits of the maxi gsc data with the disk blackbody model ( @xcite ) during phase f revealed that @xmath18 was 0.40.7 kev including a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 kev . the swift xrt observation taken on february 4 , 2010 also showed that the blackbody temperature is about 0.5 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "this temperature is lower than those of other bhcs such as gro j165540 and xte j1550564 whose @xmath18 in the hss exceeds 1 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the vary of @xmath18 is determined by how much the accretion rate exceeds the critical rate , hence a low @xmath18 indicates that the accretion rate in the hss is above the critical rate .",
    "it is known that the spectral transition from the lhs to the hss will occur at around 1020% eddington luminosity , but with large uncertainties ( @xcite ) .",
    "the k@xmath19 for the schwarzschild bh can be estimated to be @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath21 is the spectral hardening factor ( @xcite ) , @xmath22 is the eddington ratio ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 is the mass of the central object . assuming that the maximum @xmath18 is 0.6@xmath50.7 kev and @xmath22 is 0.1@xmath50.2 , the black hole mass can be roughly estimated at 8.632 m@xmath25 . the gsc flux in the 210 kev range at the outburst peak ( 2010 january 23 ) was 9.7@xmath1310@xmath26 erg @xmath8 s@xmath9 with a @xmath520% absolute flux uncertainty .",
    "assuming that 1 ) the 210 kev flux is 2128 % of the bolometric flux based on the disk blackbody model , and that 2 ) the eddington luminosity is 1.5@xmath1310@xmath27 erg s@xmath9 , the distance to the source can be estimated as 510 kpc .",
    "the authors are indebted to many other members of the maxi team and the iss / maxi operation team for their efforts during the data acquisition and the daily maxi operation .",
