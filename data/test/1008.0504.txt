    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice , has attracted a lot of research interest due to its remarkable electronic properties and its potential applications novoselov2004,zhang2005,novoselov2005a , berger2006,katsnelson2006,reviews . inside the pristine graphene",
    ", the low - energy charge carriers can be formally described by a massless dirac equation , and near dirac point one has discovered many intriguing properties , such as the unusual energy dispersion , the chiral behavior @xcite , ballistic charge transport @xcite , klein tunneling cheianov2006 , and unusual quantum hall effect novoselov2005a , purewal2006,neto2006 , bipolar supercurrent heersche2007 , frequency - dependent conductivity @xcite , gate - tunable optical transitions @xcite , and so on .",
    "however , for applications of graphene to nanoelectronics , it is crucial to generate a band gap in dirac spectrum in order to control the electronic conductivity , such as a channel material for field - effect transistor . for realizing this purpose , several approaches are studied both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "one of them is using the quantum confinement effect in graphene nanoribbons @xcite and graphene quantum dots @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the size of the gap increases as the nanoribbon width decreases and it also strongly depends on the detailed structure of the ribbon edges .",
    "an alternative method is spin - orbit coupling , which also leads to generate a small gap due to both intrinsic spin - orbit interaction or the rashba interaction kane2005,min2006,yao2007 .",
    "another approach is substrated - induced band gaps for graphene supported on boron nitride @xcite or sic zhou2007,kim2008 by making the two carbon sublattices ( a and b sublattices ) inequivalent ; and with this approach , a gap of 260mev is experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "therefore the quasiparticles in the graphene grown on a sic or boron nitride substrate behave differently from those in the graphene grown on sio@xmath1 .",
    "the effect of sublattice symmetry breaking on the induced gap is also systematically investigated @xcite .",
    "there are also theoretical works to engineer the tunable bandgap by periodic modulations of the graphene lattice via the hydrogenation of graphene @xcite , and a recent experiment demonstrates that patterned hydrogen adsorption on graphene induces a bandgap of at least 450mev around the fermi level @xcite .    since superlattices are very successful in controlling the electronic structures of many conventional semiconducting materials ( e.g. see ref .",
    "tsu2005 ) , the devices of graphene - based superlattices has attracted much attention .",
    "it can be the periodic potential structures generated by different methods , such as electrostatic potentials bai2007,park2008b , barbier2008,park2008a , barbier2009,tiwari2009 and magnetic barriers @xcite . in gapless",
    "graphene - based superlattices , researchers have found that a one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic - potential superlattice possesses some distinct electronic properties , such as the strong anisotropy for the low - energy charge carriers group velocities @xcite , the formation of the extra dirac points and new zero energy states @xcite , and the unusual properties of landau levels and the quantum hall effect for these extra dirac fermions @xcite . from the previous studies",
    "barbier2008,barbier2010,lgwang2010,arovas2010,ho2009 , one has known that for the gapless graphene superlattices there is no gap opening at the normal incidence due to the klein tunneling .",
    "most recently , the new electronic properties in gapped graphene - based devices are discovered since the klein tunneling is suppressed due to the presence of a gap gomes2008,soodchomshom2009,jiang2010,esmailpour2010,guinea2010 .",
    "all the above investigations stimulate us to study how the electronic properties and bandgap structures of the grapped graphene superlattices are affected due to a gap opening at the dirac point , and what properties are derived for the gapped graphene superlattices that are different from the gapless graphene superlattices . in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we have found that a new dirac point is formed at the energy which corresponds to the zero averaged wave - number inside the gapless graphene - based superlattices . in this paper",
    ", we will continue to investigate the electronic band structures and their transport properties for the gapped graphene superlattices with 1d periodic potentials of square barriers .",
    "we find that a zero averaged wave - number ( zero-@xmath0 ) gap is formed inside the gapped graphene - based superlattices , which is very similar to the zero - averaged refractive - index gap in 1d photonic crystals consisted of left - handed and right - handed materials @xcite .",
    "the properties of this zero-@xmath0 gap are detailed studied , and the related electronic transmission , conductance and fano factor near the zero-@xmath0 gap in the finite graphene superlattices are further illustrated .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in sec .",

    "in this section , first we will discuss the electronic band structures for the infinite periodic - barrier systems , and then we will discuss properties of the electronic transmission , conductance and fano factor for the finite periodic - barrier systems with or without the structural disorder .",
    "first , let us investigate the electronic bandgap structure for an infinite gapped graphene - based periodic - barrier systems , i.e. , ( @xmath93)@xmath94 , where the symbols @xmath95 and @xmath96 from now on denote the different barriers @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the electrostatic potentials @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the widths @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively , and @xmath41 is the periodic number .",

    "the distinct difference between the gapless and gapped graphene superlattices is that for the gapless case ( @xmath60 ) this zero-@xmath123 gap is close at the normal incidence sine @xmath124 , while for the gapped case ( @xmath125 ) it is open even at normal incidence from eq .",

    "actually the above condition ( [ cond2 ] ) is the same as that in 1d photonic crystals consisted of left - handed and right - hand materials @xcite",
    ".    figures 2(a ) to 2(d ) show clearly the dependence of the electronic band structures on the lattice constant @xmath134 for the gapped graphene superlattices with equal barrier and well widths ( i.e. , the ratio @xmath135 ) . here",
    "we take the parameter @xmath136mev .",
    "it is clear seen that the center of a band gap is exactly at energy @xmath137mev , where the condition , @xmath138 , is satisfied , see figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) .",
    "the location of this zero-@xmath123 gap is independent of the lattice constant [ see figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) ] ; while other upper or lower band gaps are strongly dependent on the lattice constant , and they are shifted with the changing of the lattice constant .",
    "the width of the zero - averaged wave - number gap depends on the lattice constant , therefore it can be tunable by changing the lattice constant .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "2(a ) , this zero-@xmath139 gap has the smallest width of @xmath140mev , which is larger than the value of @xmath141 but smaller than @xmath142 ; and in fig .",
    "2(b ) it has the smallest width of @xmath143mev , which is smaller than the value of @xmath141 . with the increasing of the lattice constant ,",
    "the slopes for both the band edges of the zero-@xmath123 gap become smaller and smaller [ see fig .",
    "2(a - c ) ] , and furthermore the gap is open or close with the change of the lattice constant [ see figs .",
    "2(e - f ) ] . in the case",
    "when the condition ( cond2 ) is valid , the gap is close for the normal incidence ( @xmath133 ) [ see fig .",
    "2(c ) ] or it is close for the inclined incidence ( @xmath144 ) and a pair of two zero-@xmath123 states appear [ see fig .",
    "actually , such kind of the crossed points is termed as the extra dirac points in the gapless graphene superlattices @xcite .",
    "compared with fig .",
    "2(e ) and 2(f ) , it is found that for the inclined cases , the zero - averaged wave - number gap is enlarged and the extra dirac points are occurring at the same energy with those of the touching points in the normal case .",
    "similarly , figure 3 shows the change of the electronic band structure for the gapped graphene superlattices with unequal barrier and well widths ( i.e. , the ratio @xmath145 ) . from figs .",
    "3(a ) to 3(c ) , it is clear that the position of zero-@xmath123 gap is still independent of the lattice constant , and in this example it is located at @xmath146mev , i. e. , the one of roots for the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) or ( [ cond11 ] ) . by the way , another root of the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) or ( [ cond11 ] ) is unphysical since it is outside of the interval @xmath147 .",
    "meanwhile , the width of this zero-@xmath123 gap could be still adjusted by changing its lattice constant with the fixed ratio @xmath148 .",
    "however for the other upper and lower band gaps are strongly shifted due to the change of the lattice constant . in fig .",
    "3(c ) , it is also occurring the touching effect of the upper and lower bands due to that the condition ( cond2 ) is satisfied at @xmath133 .",
    "different from the above case with equal barrier and well widths ( @xmath127 ) , in fig .",
    "3(d ) , when the lattice constant increases larger , the touch points move down for the inclined incidence ( @xmath144 ) in the cases with @xmath149 . in the cases with @xmath150 , one can find that the touching points move up for the inclined incidence [ see fig .",
    "this property of the touch points , depending on the ratio of widths  @xmath148 , is similar to that in the gapless graphene superlattices @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that the touch effects in figs .",
    "2(c ) and 3(c ) is very similar to the cases of zero - width band gap associated with the zero - averaged refractive index in photonic crystals containing left - handed materials lgwang2010b , diosleyva2009 .",
    "now let us turn to discuss the properties of the transmission , conductance and fano factor in the finite periodic - barrier systems . in order to know the information of the band structures for the finite systems",
    ", we have to calculate the transmission as functions of the incident electron energy and the incident angle .",
    "figure 4 shows the transmission properties of an electron passing through @xmath151 under different values of @xmath141 .",
    "figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) show the changes of electronic conductance and fano factor for those cases corresponding to different situations in fig .",
    "it is clear seen that when @xmath60 , the electronic transmission at normal incidence is always equal to unit , see fig .",
    "this property is a reflection of `` klein tunneling '' in the systems of gapless graphene superlattices barbier2008,barbier2009,barbier2010,lgwang2010,arovas2010 . from fig .",
    "4(a ) , one can also find that there is a band gap opening up at all inclined angles around the energy of @xmath137mev .",
    "actually this gap is already termed as the zero-@xmath123 gap , which is associated with the new dirac point , in our previous study on the gapless graphene superlattices @xcite . in fig .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , the conductance is largest and the fano factor is equal to 1/3 at the new dirac point ( @xmath137mev ) for the case of @xmath60 , which recovers the result for the diffusive behavior near the new dirac point . with the increasing of @xmath141 ,",
    "this band gap gradually opens up at the normal incidence , see figs .",
    "4(b)-4(d ) .",
    "therefore the conductance becomes smaller and smaller when the gap is open at the normal incidence , and the fano factor is enhanced to be larger than 1/3 . from fig .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , one can see that when the gap is completely open for the larger value of @xmath152 , the fano factor is close to unit because there is no allowed states for the electrons in this zero-@xmath123 gap .",
    "another remarkable property is that near the edges of the zero-@xmath123 gap the fano factor is also larger than 1/3 for the larger value of @xmath141 , which does not happen in the cases for smaller values of @xmath141 .",
    "it means that for the gapped graphene superlattices the electron s transport has a distinct difference from the cases of gapless graphene superlattices .",
    "it should also be pointed out that the differences for the conductances of the higher band gaps in fig .",
    "5(a ) are much small due to that the passing band is highly shifted to the higher energy for the inclined incident angles [ see figs 4(a ) to 4(d ) ] , and the fano factor for the higher band gap in fig .",
    "5(b ) is larger than 1/3 even for the case of @xmath60 .    at last , we consider the effect of the structural disorder on the transmission of an electron passing through a finite gapped graphene - based periodic - barrier structure with the width deviation . here",
    "we consider the periodic - barrier structure @xmath153 , as an example , with @xmath136mev and @xmath154 nm , where @xmath155 is a random number .",
    "figure 6 shows the effect of the structural disorder on electronic transmitivities , conductances and fano factors .",
    "it is clear seen that the zero-@xmath123 gap is insensitive to the structural disorder , while the other band gaps are destroyed by strong disorder , see fig .",
    "the robustness of the zero-@xmath132 gap comes from the fact that the zero-@xmath123 solution remains invariant under disorder that is symmetric ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 equally probable ) , see eq . ( [ dispersion11 ] ) .",
    "these results are very similar to that cases in the gapless graphene superlattices @xcite , and the unique difference is that at the normal incidence the zero-@xmath123 gap is close for the gapless case while it is still open for the gapped case . from figs .",
    "6(b ) and 6(c ) , one can find that the structural disorder does strongly affect on the properties of the electronic conductance and fano factor when the incident electron s energy @xmath27 is far away from the zero-@xmath123 gap . in figs .",
    "5(b , c ) , it is clear that the curves of the conductances and fano factors are much different from each other for those energies far away from @xmath158mev .",
    "therefore , the zero-@xmath123 gap and its related properties are very insensitive to the structural disorder while the other bands and gaps are highly affected by the structural disorder .",
    "in summary , we have studied the electronic band structures and its transport properties for the gapped graphene superlattices consisted of 1d periodic potentials of square barriers .",
    "we have found that there is a zero-@xmath159 gap inside the gapped graphene - based superlattices , and the location of the zero-@xmath0 gap is independent of the lattice constant but depends on the ratio of the barrier and well widths .",
    "furthermore we have shown that the width of the zero-@xmath0 gap could be controllable by changing the lattice constant of the gapped superlattices , and under the certain condition the zero-@xmath0 gap could be close at the case of normal incidence and the band - crossing phenomena ( the extra new dirac points ) occurs at the case of inclined incidence inside the gapped graphene superlattices , which are similar to the cases of the gapless graphene superlattices @xcite .",
    "finally it is revealed that the properties of the electronic transmission , conductance and fano factor near the zero-@xmath0 gap are insensitive to the structural disorder inside the finite periodic - barrier systems .",
    "our analytical and numerical results on the electronic band structures and their related properties of the gapped graphene - based superlattices are hopefully of benefit to more potential applications of graphene - based devices .",
