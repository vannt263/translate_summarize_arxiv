    "recently , kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) have been discovered in eleven low - mass x - ray binaries ( see van der klis @xcite for a review ) .",
    "often , the x - ray power spectra show twin khz peaks moving up and down in frequency together .",
    "sometimes a third khz peak is detected near a frequency equal to the separation frequency of the twin peaks , or twice that , suggesting a beat - frequency interpretation , with the third peak near the neutron star spin frequency ( or twice that ) .",
    "however , in sco  x1 the twin peak separation varies , which is not consistent with a simple beat - frequency interpretation ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the x - ray burster ( swank et al . @xcite ; brandt et al .",
    "@xcite ) and suspected atoll source ( singh & apparao @xcite ) 4u  0614 + 09 twin khz peaks occur ( ford et al .",
    "the peaks move between 480 and 800  hz and 520 and 1150  hz , respectively .",
    "their separation is consistent with being constant near 323  hz . there has been one 3.3@xmath10 detection of a third peak near 328  hz ( in the persistent emission , whereas in the three other sources where a third peak occured it was seen during x - ray bursts ) .",
    "it is yet unclear how the properties of the khz qpo relate to type and state of the sources in which they have been observed . in this paper",
    "we analyze new x - ray timing and spectral data on 4u  0614 + 09 ( preliminary reported previously in van der klis et al .",
    "we point out a number of correlations between the qpo properties and those of the broad - band noise and the x - ray spectra , and present for the first time an analysis of the photon energy spectrum of the oscillating flux in khz qpo .",
    "we observed 4u  0614 + 09 with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board nasa s rossi x - ray timing explorer ( bradt , rothschild , & swank @xcite ) three times , in february , march , and april 1996 ( table  [ tabpow ] ) .",
    "we simultaneously collected 260  kev data with a time resolution of 8  @xmath11s in 8 energy bands , and 16  s in 129 bands .",
    "the background and deadtime corrected count rates were 235 , 571 , and 256 c / s , respectively . a change in pca gain between march and april affected these values only slightly . in april ,",
    "only 3 out of the 5 pca detectors were active ; the 5 detector count rate was 426  c / s .",
    "we observed no x - ray bursts .",
    "we calculated power spectra of the 8  @xmath11s data and subtracted the poisson noise and the very large event window contribution ( zhang et al .",
    "@xcite ; zhang @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained background measurements from slew and earth occultations data , and used them to renormalize all power spectra to fractional rms squared per hertz ( see van der klis @xcite ) , and to correct the x - ray spectra obtained from the 16  s data .",
    "all power spectra ( fig .  [ figpow ] ) show strong ( @xmath030% rms ) band - limited noise , which we fitted with a broken power law . in two cases we observed khz qpos .",
    "these we fitted with lorentzian peaks .",
    "the fit results are listed in table  [ tabpow ] . the power - law break frequency varied from 0.7  hz in february , via 15.4  hz in march to 6.6  hz in april .    during march and april strong qpo",
    "are present near 727 and 629  hz , respectively .",
    "the qpo properties did not vary significantly within each observation .",
    "we detect no other khz qpo peaks .",
    "in particular , any peaks 323  hz above or below our detected peaks are 3 to 14 times weaker than these ( table  [ tabpow ] ) . the upper limit on any 328  hz peak is 3.5% ( rms ; 95% confidence ) .",
    "countrates in march were sufficient to study the photon energy dependence of the qpo .",
    "we fitted power spectra in 5 energy bands ( 1.14.36.88.415.569.8  kev ) with the break frequency , the power law slopes , and qpo frequency and width fixed to the 260  kev values ( none of these varied significantly with photon energy ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2a the rms amplitude of the qpo rose from 11% at 3.3  kev via 20% at 11  kev to ( 37@xmath912)% at 22.8  kev .",
    "similar energy dependencies were seen in other sources .",
    "the fractional rms amplitude of the band - limited noise did not vary significantly as a function of photon energy .",
    "2b shows the energy spectrum of the oscillating flux ( qpo rms amplitude in units of c / s / kev vs. photon energy ) . for reference , we quote the results of a blackbody fit : the best fit ( @xmath12 with 3 dof ) has a temperature of ( 1.56@xmath13  kev ) and a radius of ( 500@xmath14  m ) ( at 3  kpc , brandt et al .",
    "the resolution of the spectrum is low and many spectral models are consistent with it . for example , the data can be fitted by a @xmath15% temperature variation in a @xmath16  kev blackbody spectrum with a radius of 10  km , or ( @xmath17 with 4 dof ) by @xmath18% optical depth variations in an unsaturated comptonization spectrum .",
    "( this latter result was obtained by fitting the fractional rms spectrum . )    to convert count rates to fluxes , we fitted the 250  kev energy spectra with a blackbody plus a power law modified by interstellar absorption ( table  [ tabpow ] ) . in april and during a dip in soft color in march ( below ) , a power law alone could fit the spectrum .",
    "the inferred 210  kev fluxes were 0.4 , 1.0 , and 0.75 @xmath19 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 in february , march , and april , respectively ; the 250  kev fluxes are 50 , 30 , and 40% higher , respectively . as @xmath20 is low absorbed and `` unabsorbed '' fluxes are the same .",
    "we tried various other spectral shapes , with no effect on the derived fluxes .",
    "count rate , flux nor power spectra were affected by the soft color dip .    to compare 4u  0614 + 09 to confirmed atoll sources ( cf . hasinger & van der klis @xcite ) , we produced an x - ray color - color diagram using the three spectral bands 251050  kev ( fig  [ color ] ) .",
    "we corrected for detector gain changes by comparing the count rate ratios with incident flux ratios obtained in the same bands from the spectral fits .",
    "once again we tried different spectral shapes and found negligible effects on the color corrections .",
    "there was a @xmath21  s dip in soft color starting 5200  s into the march observation . apart from this",
    ", the colors within each observation show no significant changes , with upper limits on any intrinsic color variations of @xmath010% . except for the march excursion , this is entirely consistent with atoll - source island - state behavior .",
    "from color - color diagrams singh & apparao ( @xcite ) suggested 4u  0614 + 09 to be an atoll source .",
    "our color - color diagrams and spectral fits , and simultaneous strong band - limited noise with 0.715  hz cutoff frequencies confirm that the correlated x - ray spectral and timing properties of 4u  0614 + 09 are those of an atoll source , in the island state during our observations . the large fractional amplitude and low cut - off frequency of the band - limited noise and the relatively hard x - ray spectra make the source similar to the atoll sources 4u  160852 and 4u  170544 in the island state ( hasinger & van der klis @xcite ; langmeier , hasinger , & trmper @xcite ; yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite ; berger & van der klis @xcite ) , which in turn resemble the black hole candidates cyg  x1 and gx  3394 in the low and intermediate states ( van der klis @xcite ; berger & van der klis @xcite ; belloni et al .",
    "@xcite ; crary et al .",
    "@xcite ; mndez & van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "all these sources are quite hard .",
    "their energy spectra fit a soft component with @xmath22  kev plus a power law with photon index 1.62.5 . their power spectra show band limited noise with a @xmath23  hz cut - off frequency that is anticorrelated with the level of the flat top ( belloni & hasinger @xcite ; mndez & van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "this anti - correlation holds also for our power spectra of 4u  0614 + 09 .",
    "break frequencies and fractional rms at the break are fully consistent with the existing relation between these quantities from other sources ( c.f . fig . 3 of mndez & van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "if as proposed ( van der klis @xcite ; mndez & van der klis @xcite ) , the break frequency of the band limited noise component here is an indication for @xmath8 , then @xmath8 increased from february to march , and then decreased to an intermediate value in april .",
    "this is consistent with the variations in x - ray flux among our three observations .",
    "note , that this is not always the case in similar sources ( e.g. , 4u  160852 ; yoshida et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this picture",
    ", we observe no khz qpo ( @xmath66% rms ) , when @xmath8 is lowest , and 1115% amplitude qpos at higher inferred @xmath8 .",
    "although khz qpos often get stronger when inferred @xmath8 drops ( in 4u  163653 , wijnands et al .",
    "@xcite ; ks  1731260 , wijnands & van der klis @xcite ; 4u  182030 , smale , zhang , & white @xcite ) , apparently in 4u  0614 + 09 there is a value of @xmath8 below which the qpo becomes weaker .",
    "we now turn to the identification of our qpo peaks . in our data at most one peak is present at each time , whereas for similar count rates ford et al .",
    "( @xcite ) usually find twin peaks .",
    "the count rate vs. qpo frequency relations do not clearly identify our peaks as either the higher- or the lower - frequency ones ( fig .",
    "[ qporate ] ) .",
    "the qpos amplitudes _ do _ give a clue .",
    "ford et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found the lower - frequency peak to have an rms amplitude 0.250.75 times that of the higher - frequency peak when the count rate was near 400  c / s , and 0.51.5 that at 600700  c / s . if our peaks are the higher - frequency ones , these ratios are @xmath60.3 to @xmath24 in our data . if they are the lower - frequency ones , these values are @xmath252.4 to @xmath253.5 .",
    "as our countrates are 400600  c / s , our peaks are probably the higher - frequency ones .",
    "then , in our data we have a positive correlation between qpo frequency and count rate , but one that does not fit either of the relations observed previously ( see fig .  [ qporate ] ) .    the qpo frequency vs. count rate diagram of 4u  0614 + 09 ( fig .  [ qporate ] )",
    "shows that there is no single relation that describes the correlation between those two quantities .",
    "this means that either countrate or frequency ( or both ) does not track @xmath8 well .",
    "we suggest that count rate is not a good measure of @xmath8 . both spectral changes and variations in the anisotropy of the emission",
    "can destroy the expected correspondence between these two quantities . to the extent that bolometric corrections can be accurately performed",
    ", a conversion to energy flux adjusts for the spectral changes .",
    "however , the experience from the z sources ( at admittedly much higher @xmath8 ) shows that even derived bolometric x - ray fluxes do not always track @xmath8 well . in 4u  160852 , in a very similar series of island state observations as the present ones of 4u  0614 + 09 , yoshida et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that the bolometric flux did not exhibit a one - to - one correspondence to cutoff frequency of the band - limited noise .",
    "whereas there are many processes that can quite easily change the observed x - ray count rates , colours , spectral parameters , and even bolometric fluxes from their original values , the noise cutoff frequency is not so easily affected .",
    "the noise cutoff can , in principle , be lowered by scattering delays .",
    "the khz qpo frequency , on the other hand , is very likely a direct diagnostic of the dynamics of the inner flow and is therefore very hard to modify by any propagation effect .",
    "it is possible , then , that qpo frequency _ is _ well correlated to @xmath8 , but countrate is not",
    ". it will be of great interest to see if the correlation suggested by the joint decrease of the noise cutoff frequency and qpo frequency from march to april ( see table  [ tabpow ] ) will hold up in future analyses of other data , or whether a qpo frequency vs. flux relation will turn out to be the more reproducible , as this may provide clues to both the best measure of @xmath8 in atoll sources in extreme island states ( and perhaps black - hole candidates ) and to the physical origin of khz qpo and broad - band noise in these systems .",
    "we observed a very strong energy dependence in the khz qpo but no energy dependence in the band - limited noise",
    ". one plausible interpretation of this , namely , that the low energy photons undergo scattering with a characteristic delay time scale intermediate between the qpo time scale ( 1  ms ) and that of the noise ( 0.110  s ) , can probably be excluded on the basis of the extremely small ( 20  @xmath11s and @xmath650  @xmath11s ) time lags between the khz qpo signals at different photon energies recently reported by vaughan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "( of course , scattering with shorter characteristic time scales can not be excluded and is in fact likely on other grounds . ) the khz qpo spectrum which resembles a blackbody shape with a characteristic temperature of 1.6  kev and radius of 500  m , might indicate an origin associated with a relatively small area on the neutron star surface , whereas the band - limited noise may have a _",
    "different _ site of origin , perhaps in the inner disk . this would be in accordance with the observation that band - limited noise is a common trait among neutron stars and black holes ( van der klis @xcite ) , whereas correlated twin khz qpo peaks are so far unique to neutron star systems .",
