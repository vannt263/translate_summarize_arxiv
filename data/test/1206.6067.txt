    "the large - scale halo of hot gas provides a unique way to measure the baryonic and gravitational mass of galaxy clusters .",
    "the baryonic mass can be measured directly from the observation of the hot x - ray emitting intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , and of the associated stellar component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while measurements of the gravitational mass require the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium between the gas and dark matter .",
    "cluster cores are subject to a variety of non - gravitational heating and cooling processes that may result in deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium , and in inner regions beyond the core the icm is expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter potential . at the outskirts , the low - density icm and the proximity to the sources of accretion results in the onset of new physical processes such as departure from hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , clumping of the gas @xcite , different temperature between electrons and ions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and flattening of the entropy profile @xcite , leading to possible sources of systematic uncertainties in the measurement of masses .",
    "the detection of hot gas at large radii is limited primarily by its intrinsic low surface brightness , uncertainties associated with the subtraction of background ( and foreground ) emission , and the ability to remove contamination from compact sources unrelated to the cluster .",
    "thanks to its low detector background , _ suzaku _  reported the measurement of icm temperatures to  and beyond for a few nearby clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "we report the _ chandra _  detection of x - ray emission in 1835  beyond , using three observations for a total of 193  ksec exposure time , extending the analysis of these _ chandra _  data performed by @xcite .",
    "the radius @xmath1 is defined as the radius within which the average mass density is @xmath2 times the critical density of the universe at the cluster s redshift for our choice of cosmological parameters . the virial radius of a cluster is defined as the equilibrium radius of the collapsed halo , approximately equivalent to one half of its turnaround radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for an @xmath3-dominated universe , the virial radius is approximately @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "1835  is the most luminous cluster in the @xcite sample of clusters at @xmath5 selected from the _ bright cluster survey_. the combination of high luminosity and availability of deep _ chandra _  observations with local background make 1835and ideal candidate to study its emission to the virial radius .",

    "figure  [ fig : a1835 ] is an image from the longest observation ( i d 6880 , 118ks ) in the soft x - ray band ( 0.7 - 2 kev ) .",
    "in addition to a large number of compact x - ray sources that were excluded from further analysis , the data show a clear detection of diffuse x - ray emission associated with two additional low - mass clusters identified from the _ sloan digital sky survey _ , maxbcg j210.31728 + 02.75364 and whl j140031.8 + 025443 .",
    "the cluster maxbcg j210.31728 + 02.75364 is the only cluster in the vicinity of 1835reported in the maxbcg catalog of @xcite , and it has a measured photo-@xmath11 of 0.238 , while the catalog of @xcite reports a photo-@xmath11 of 0.269 for the same source ; given the uncertainties associated with photometric redshifts , it is likely that the cluster is in physical association with 1835  ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the @xcite catalog also reports another optically - identified cluster in the area , whl j140031.8 + 025443 , with a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath12 .",
    "the association of these two groups with 1835  is confirmed by redshift data provided by c. haines ( personal communication ) , who measures a redshift of @xmath13 for whl j140031.8 + 025443 , and @xmath14 for maxbcg j210.31728 + 02.75364 .    since the goal of this paper is to study the diffuse emission associated with 1835 , we excise a region of radius 90  arcsec around the position of the two clusters ( black circles in figure  [ fig : a1835 ] ) , and study their emission separately from that of 1835(see section  [ sec : low - mass - clusters ] ) .",
    "the reduction of the _ chandra _  observations follow the procedure described in @xcite and @xcite , which consists of filtering the observations for possible periods of flaring background , and applying the latest calibration ; no significant flares were present in these observations .",
    "the reduction was performed in ciao  4.2 , using caldb 4.3 ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : robustness ] we discuss the impact of calibration changes on our results .",
    "one of the calibration issues that can affect the measurement of cluster emission is the uncertainty in the contamination of the optical blocking filter , which causes a reduction in the low energy quantum efficiency of the _ chandra _  detectors .",
    "the spatial and time dependence of this contaminant affects primarily the effective area at @xmath150.7 kev  , with an estimated residual error of @xmath15 3% at higher energy .",
    "we therefore limit our spatial and spectral analysis to the @xmath160.7  kev band .",
    "the superior angular resolution of the _ chandra _  mirrors @xcite results in a point - spread function with a 0.5  arcsec fwhm , and therefore there is negligible contribution from the bright cluster core to the emission in the outer annuli , and from secondary scatter ( stray light ) by sources outside the field of view .",
    "the subtraction of particle and sky background is one of the most crucial aspects of the analysis of low surface brightness cluster regions .",
    "we use _ chandra _  blank - sky background observations , rescaled according to the high- energy flux of the cluster , to ensure a correct subtraction of the particle background that is dominant at @xmath17  kev , where the chandra detectors have no effective area .",
    "the temporal and spatial variability of the soft x - ray background at @xmath18  kev also requires that a peripheral region free of cluster emission is used to measure any local enhancement ( or deficit ) of soft x - ray emission relative to that of the blank - sky fields , and account for this difference in the analysis .",
    "this method is accurate for the determination of the temperature profile , but may result in small errors in the measurement of the surface brightness profile .",
    "in fact , the blank - sky background is a combination of a particle component that is not vignetted , and a sky component that is vignetted . to determine the surface brightness of the cluster and of the local soft x - ray background ,",
    "a more accurate procedure consists of subtracting the non - vignetted particle component as measured from _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations in which the acis detector was stowed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , after rescaling the stowed background to match the @xmath17  kev cluster count rate , as in the case of the blank - sky background .",
    "point sources are identified and removed using a wavelet detection method that correlates the cluster observation with wavelet functions of different scale sizes ( _ wavdetect _ in ciao ) .",
    "subtraction of point soures from the blank - sky observations were performed by eye , with results that closely match those of the wavelet method .",
    "the surface brightness profile obtained using this background subtraction is shown in figure  [ fig : sx ] , in which the red line represents the average value of the background at radii @xmath16  700 arcsec , where the surface brightness profile is consistent with a constant level . to determine the outer radius at which _",
    "_  has a significant detection of the cluster , we also include sources of systematic errors in our analysis .",
    "one source of uncertainty is the error in the measurement of the background level , shown in figure  [ fig : sx - closeup ] as the solid red lines .",
    "the error is given by the standard deviation of the weighted mean of the datapoints at radii greater than 700  arcsec , to illustrate that each bin in the surface brightness profile beyond this radius is consistent with a constant level of the background .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the amount by which the stowed background is to be rescaled to match the cluster count rate at high energy .",
    "the stowed background dataset applicable to the dates of observation of 1835  has an exposure time of 367  ksec , and the relative error in the rescaling of the background to match the cluster count rate at high energy is 0.7% , as determined by the poisson error in the photon counts at high energy .",
    "moreover , @xcite has shown that the spectral distribution of the particle background is remarkably stable , even in the presence of changes in the overall flux , and that the ratio of soft - to - hard ( 2 - 7 kev to 9.5 - 12 kev ) count rates remains constant to within @xmath152  % .",
    "we therefore apply a systematic error of 2  % in the stowed background flux , to account for this possible source of uncertainty , in addition to the 0.7% error due to the uncertainty in the rescaling of the background .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sx - closeup ] the green error bars represent the cumulative effect of the statistical error due to the counting statistic , and the sources of errors associated with the use of the stowed background ; the systematic errors were added linearly to the statistical error as a conservative measure .",
    "this error analysis shows that the emission from 1835  remains significantly above the background beyond  and until approximately a radius of 600 arcsec , or approximately 2.4  mpc .",
    "the significance of the detection in the region 450 - 600 `` ( the five datapoints in figure  [ fig : sx - closeup ] after the @xmath19 marker ) is calculated as 5.5@xmath20 , and is obtained by using the larger systematic error bars for the surface brightness profile ( in green in figure  [ fig : sx - closeup ] ) , added in quadrature to the error in the determination of the background level from the @xmath21 '' region ( red lines in figure  [ fig : sx - closeup ] ) .    to further test the effect of the background subtraction , we repeat our backround subtraction process using the @xmath22 `` region ( instead of the @xmath21 '' region ) . the background level increases by less than 1@xmath20 of the value previously determined ( e.g. , the two levels are statistically indistinguishable ) , and the significance of detection in the region 450 - 600 \" is 4.7@xmath20 .",
    "therefore we conclude that it is unlikely that the excess of emission beyond  and out to the virial radius is due to errors in the background subtraction process .",
    "a similar result can be obtained including the 2 - 7 kev band , but the signal - to - noise is reduced because at large radii this band is dominated by the background due to the softening of the cluster emission .",
    "we estimate  and the virial radius ( @xmath23 ) from the _ chandra _  data in section  [ sec : r500 ] .",
    "_ rosat _  observed 1835  on july 34 2003 for 6  ks with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) , observation i d was 800569 .",
    "the pspc has a 99.9% rejection of particle background in the 0.2 - 2  kev band @xcite and an average angular resolution of @xmath2430  arcsec that makes it very suitable for observations of low surface brightness objects such as the outskirts of galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we reduce the event file following the procedure described in @xcite and @xcite , which consists of corrections for detector gain fluctuations , and removal of periods with a _ master veto _ rate of @xmath15170 counts  s@xmath7 in order to discard periods of high background .",
    "these filters result in a clean exposure time of 5.9  ks .    since the pspc background is given only by the photon background , we generate an image in the 0.2 - 2 kev band and use the exposure map to correct for the position ",
    "dependent variations in the detector response and mirror vignetting .",
    "we masked out the two low - mass cluster regions as we did for the _ chandra _  data and all visible point sources , and obtained and exposure - corrected surface brightness profile out to a radial distance of @xmath2420 arcmin , which corresponds to the location of the inner support structure of the pspc detector .",
    "the _ rosat _  surface brightness profile therefore covers the entire azimuthal range . in figure",
    "[ fig : rosat ] we show the radial profile of the surface brightness in the 0.2 - 2 kev band , showing a @xmath242  @xmath20 excess of emission in the 400 - 600 `` region using the background level calculated from the region @xmath16700 '' , as done for the _ chandra _  data .",
    "the _ rosat _  data therefore provide additional evidence of emission beyond  and out to the virial radius , although the short _ rosat _  exposure does not have sufficient number of counts to provide a detection with the same significance as in the _ chandra _  data .",

    "despite its higher background , _ chandra _  provides a superior angular resolution to image and remove emission from unrelated sources . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : a1835 ] , there are approximately 100 point - like sources that were automatically detected and removed , and we were also able to identify two low - mass clusters that are likely associated with 1835 .",
    "_ chandra _  therefore has the ability to constrain the emission of clusters to the virial radius , especially for higher - redshift cool - core clusters for which the _ suzaku _  point - spread function would cause significant contamination from the central signal to large radii .",
    "it is not easy to interpret the emission at the outskirts as an extension of the hot gas detected at radii @xmath15  .",
    "in fact , as shown in section  [ sec : hse ] , the steepening of the temperature profile is incompatible with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium at large radii .",
    "we also showed in section  [ sec : entropy ] that the gas has a negative entropy gradient beyond this radius , rendering it convectively unstable . therefore , if the temperature profile of figure  [ fig : kt-0 - 600-fit ] originates from a single phase of the icm , convection would transport hotter gas towards the outskirts , flattening the temperature profile within a few gyrs .",
    "cooling of the gas by thermal radiation can not be responsible for off - setting the heating by convection , since the cooling time ( @xmath74 ) is longer at the outskirts than in the peak - temperature regions due to the higher density .      a possible interpretation for the detection of emission near the virial radius and its steep temperature profile is the presence of a separate phase at the cluster outskirts that is not in hydrostatic equilibrum with the cluster s potential .",
    "in this case , cooler gas may be the result of infall from filamentary structures that feed gas into the cluster , and the temperature of this _ warm - hot _ gas may in fact be lower than that shown in figure  [ fig : kt-0 - 600-fit ] ( i.e. , @xmath75  kev for the region @xmath76 \" ) if this gas lies in projection against the tail end of the hotter icm .",
    "we estimate the mass of this putative warm - hot gas assuming that all of the emission from the outermost region is from a uniform density gas seen in projection .",
    "this assumption may result in an overestimate of the emission measure ; in fact , the extrapolation of the gas density profile in the hydrostatic or convective scenarios may yield a significant amount of emission in the last radial bin .",
    "we were unable to perform a self - consistent modelling of the emission in the full radial range , since the low signal - to - noise ratio does not allow a two - phase modelling in the last radial bin . in this simple uniform density warm - hot gas scenario ,",
    "the gas is in a filamentary structure of length @xmath77 and area @xmath78 , where @xmath79 \" and @xmath80 ; this is the same model also considered in @xcite for the cluster _",
    "abell  s1101_. since the length @xmath77 of the filament along the sightline is unknown , we must either assume @xmath77 or the electron density @xmath81 , and estimate the mass implied by the detected emission .",
    "the emission integral for this region is proportional to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is measured in xspec from a fit to the spectrum , @xmath84 is the angular distance in cm , @xmath11 is the cluster redshift , and the volume is @xmath85 . for this estimate",
    "we assume for simplicity that the mean atomic weights of hydrogen and of the electrons are the same , @xmath86 .",
    "using the best - fit spectral model with @xmath87 kev , we measure @xmath88 .",
    "if we assume a filament of length @xmath89  mpc , then the average density is @xmath90  @xmath91 , and the filament mass is @xmath92  @xmath52 .",
    "alternatively , a more diffuse filament gas of @xmath93  @xmath91 would require a filament of length @xmath94  mpc , with a mass of @xmath95  @xmath52 , comparable to the entire hot gas mass within .",
    "the fact that a lower density gas yields a higher mass is given by the fact that , for a measured value of @xmath83 we obtain @xmath96 , and therefore the mass is proportional to @xmath97 . for comparison , the gas mass for this shell inferred from the standard analysis , i.e. , assuming that the gas is in the shell itself , is @xmath98  @xmath52 , as can be also seen from table  [ tab : vikh - masses ] .",
    "if the gas is cooler , then the mass budget would increase further .",
    "in fact , the bulk of the emission from cooler gas falls outside of the _ chandra _  bandpass , and for a fixed number of detected counts the required emission integral increases .",
    "we illustrate this situation by fitting the annulus to an emission model with a fixed value of @xmath99  kev , which result in a value of @xmath100 ( the fit is significantly poorer , with @xmath101 for one fewer degree of freedom ) . accordingly",

    "using the _ rosat _  soft x - ray position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) detector ",
    "better suited to detect the emission from sub - kev plasma  we have already reported the detection of a large - scale halo of emission around the _ coma _ cluster out to @xmath24  5 mpc , well beyond the cluster s virial radius @xcite .",
    "it is possible to speculate that the high mass of 1835 , one of the most luminous and massive clusters on the _ bright cluster survey _ sample @xcite , is responsible for the heating of the infalling gas to temperatures that makes it detectable by _ chandra _ , and that other massive clusters may therefore provide evidence of emission to the virial radius with the _ chandra _  acis detectors .",
    "the infall scenario is supported by the _ herschel _ observations of @xcite , who measure a galaxy velocity distribution for 1835that does not appear to decline at large radii as in most of the other clusters in their sample .",
    "a possible interpretation for their data is the presence of a surrounding filamentary structure that is infalling into the cluster .",
    "masses and entropy measured in this paper assume that the gas has a uniform density at each radius . to quantify the effect of departures from uniform density , we define the clumping factor @xmath65 as the ratio of density averages over a large region , @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "clumped gas emits more efficiently than gas of uniform density , and the same surface brightness @xmath105 results in a lower estimate for the gas density and mass , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a distance along the sightline . from figure",
    "[ fig : entropy - profile ] we see that the entropy drop from approximately 400 `` to 600 '' would be offset by a decrease in @xmath108 by a factor of 3 , or a decrease in @xmath81 by a factor of 5 .",
    "we therefore suggest that a clumping factor of @xmath109 at 600 \" would in principle be able to provide a flat entropy profile , and even higher clumping factors would provide an increasing entropy profile in better agreement with theory ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite suggest values of the clumping factor @xmath110 near , with significantly higher clumping possible at larger radii .",
    "use of the @xcite model in the analysis of a large sample of galaxy clusters by @xcite results in better agreement of observations with numerical simulations .",
    "clumping can also affect the measurement of hydrostatic masses .",
    "in particular , gas with an increasing radial profile of the clumping factor could result in a steeper gradient of the density profile , when compared with what is measured assuming a uniform density . according to equation  [ eq : hse ]",
    ", this would result in larger estimates of the hydrostatic mass , in principle able to reduce or entirely offset the apparent decreas of @xmath111 reported in figure  [ fig : mass-0 - 600 ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that a radial increase in the clumping of the gas can in principle account for the apparent decrease of the mass profile and of the entropy profile reported in this paper ( figures  [ fig : mass-0 - 600 ] and [ fig : entropy - profile ] ) , and therefore it is a viable scenario to interpret our _ chandra _  observations .",
    "clumping of the gas at large radii has also been suggested based on _ suzaku _  observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we have reported the detection of emission from 1835  with _ chandra_out to the cluster s virial radius .",
    "the cluster s surface brightness is significantly above the background level out to a radius of approximately 10 arcminutes , which correspond to @xmath242.4 mpc at the cluster s redshift .",
    "we have investigated several sources of systematic errors in the background subtraction process , and determined that the significance of the detection in the outer region ( 450 - 600 \" ) is @xmath112  @xmath20 , and the emission can not be explained by fluctuations in the background .",
    "detection out to the virial radius is also implied by the _ xmm - newton _  temperature profile reported by @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _  superior angular resolution made it straightforward to identify and subtract sources of x - ray emission that are unrelated to the cluster .",
    "in addition to a large number of point sources , we have identified x - ray emission from two low - mass clusters that were selected from the sdss data , maxbcg j210.31728 + 02.75364 @xcite and whl j140031.8 + 025443 @xcite .",
    "the two clusters have photometric and spectroscopic redshifts that make them likely associated with 1835 .",
    "these are the only two sdss - selected clusters that are in the vicinity of 1835 .",
    "the outer regions of the 1835  cluster have a sharp drop in the temperature profile , a factor of about ten from the peak temperature .",
    "the sharp drop in temperature implies that the hot gas can not be in hydrostatic equilibrium , and that the hot gas would be convectively unstable .",
    "a possible scenario to explain the observations is the presence of _ warm - hot _ gas near the virial radius that is not in hydrostatic equilibrium with the cluster s potential , and with a mass budget comparable to that of the entire icm .",
