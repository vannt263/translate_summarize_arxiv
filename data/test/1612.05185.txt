    "discovery of the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model ( sm ) by the atlas and the cms experiments became the moment of triumph for particle physics @xcite .",
    "such a historic discovery together with decades of eletroweak precision data have well established the validity of sm up to accessable energies .",
    "however , there is no verified explanation of the origin of the small neutrino masses and no viable candidate for the dark matter in the sm . due to these unwavering issues",
    ", various extensions of sm have been proposed .",
    "the secret of neutrino masses may lie in some form of seesaw mechanism , where a sm singlet right - handed neutrinos with large majorana masses cause the light neutrino masses ( type - i seesaw ) @xcite or a sm weak scalar triplet with a tiny induced vacuum expectation value ( vev ) generates the small neutrino masses ( type - ii seesaw ) @xcite .",
    "if neutrino masses are generated as loop corrections , the masses will naturally be suppressed and such extensions of sm are both theoretically well motivated and phenomenologically viable @xcite .",
    "searches for a stable dark matter candidate have also been motivation for various extensions of the sm .",
    "some form of symmetry usually stabilizes the dark matter .",
    "simple discrete symmetries such as r - parity in supersymmetric models @xcite can perform an excellent job of preventing the particle from decaying .",
    "kaluza - klein parity @xcite in universal extra dimension models and t - parity in the littlest higgs models @xcite can stabilize the lightest particle ; turning them into promising dark matter candidates .",
    "a similar role is played by a @xmath5 symmetry for the case of inert doublet models @xcite or scotogenic models @xcite .",
    "sm extended by a scalar singlet carrying a discrete @xmath5 parity is yet another example for a simple dark matter model . instead of being an adhoc symmetry , this @xmath5 symmetry can be a remnant of the @xmath6 generator of @xmath7 grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 guts provide one of the most lucrative frameworks , where one can incorporate many of the aforementioned extensions of sm along with a beautiful unified picture of sm gauge couplings . among the classes of @xmath7 guts , supersymmetric versions have multiple features such as successful unification of gauge couplings and natural dark matter candidate owing to an automatic r - parity , while it solves the gauge hierarchy problem based on symmetry principle .",
    "in addition , supersymmetric models offer a mechanism for triggering electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) via radiative effects @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the positive mass parameter of the higgs boson at high energy becomes negative at low energy due to the renormalization group flow which dictates how the parameters evolve with scale .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility of radiative ewsb breaking in non - supersymmetric ( non - susy ) extensions of the sm .",
    "since this is an attractive mechanism to trigger ewsb , checking its viability in non - susy models is of great interest .",
    "as we argue below , such a radiative ewsb may be necessary in certain unified theories which have two stages of symmetry breaking . in a general context a positive mass parameter for the higgs boson turning negative",
    "also enhances the available parameter space .    in some extensions of sm ,",
    "the higgs boson is a part of the larger multiplet , which breaks some higher symmetry .",
    "this occurs in trinification models based on @xmath8 gauge symmetry @xcite broken by two @xmath9 higgs multiplets .",
    "these multiplets contain sm singlet components which acquire large vevs breaking the gauge symmetry down to sm .",
    "the same @xmath9 multiplets also contain the higgs boson of the sm which should develop a negative squared mass to trigger ewsb .",
    "consistency of the high scale symmetry breaking , however , would demand that all physical higgs bosons , including the sm higgs , have positive squared masses at a high energy .",
    "one could introduce new higgs fields to break the electroweak symmetry in which case the model looses its minimality and predictivity .",
    "for such class of models one might employ radiative loop corrections to turn higgs mass parameter negative at low energy from positive value it obtained at high energy and thus cause eletroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "a second example is provided by a class of @xmath7 models with the symmetry breaking sectors containing @xmath10 along with either a @xmath11 or a @xmath12 @xcite where flavor mixing is induced by vector - like fermions in the @xmath13 representation . in such models ,",
    "the sm singlet from @xmath10 acquires a gut scale vev , breaking @xmath7 down to @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath10 also contains a sm higgs doublet which must have positive squared mass at the gut scale .",
    "this positive mass term can turn negative at low energy due to renormalization group flow .",
    "similar arguments can be applied for the case where a sm singlet of @xmath15-representation breaks @xmath7 down to sm @xcite .",
    "the higgs doublet is also part of @xmath15 , which should have a positive squared mass at the gut scale .    in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in several popular extensions of the sm .",
    "the mechanism fails in the sm , as reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sm and type - i ] . in type - i seesaw models which includes right - handed neutrinos to the spectrum of sm",
    ", radiative ewsb is not achieved - in fact the effect of @xmath16 fields is to provide _ positive _ corrections to the higgs mass parameter in evolving from high to low energies .",
    "the situation is different in type - ii seesaw models which contain a weak scalar triplet , if the mass of the triplet is around the tev scale .",
    "the key difference is the cross coupling between the sm higgs boson and an additional scalar field in the higgs potential .",
    "the need for this additional scalar field to be at the tev scale arises from the needed magnitude of the @xmath17 parameter : @xmath18 . as the correction to @xmath17 from the scalar cross coupling grows as @xmath19 of the new scalar",
    ", this scalar should not be much heavier than a tev , assuming that the quartic cross couplings are not extremely weak .",
    "radiative mass generation is a popular mechanism for neutrino masses where one assumes new scalars at the tev scale for lepton number violation .",
    "such models are amenable to radiative ewsb .",
    "dark matter models employing a scalar singlet or an inert doublet also exhibit radiative ewsb .",
    "finally , we propose and analyze a universal seesaw model wherein a new @xmath0 symmetry is broken at tev scale , which also shows radiative ewsb .    in non - supersymmtric extensions of the sm such as the ones studied here , the gauge hierarchy problem has to be somehow solved .",
    "here we simply assume that this is done by fine - tuning .",
    "the dimensionful parameters of the sm extensions are given by @xmath20 where the @xmath21 donate mass parameters for additional scalar fields that may be present and @xmath22 is the cosmological constant .",
    "these dimensionful parameters may take , for reasons not understood , special values , rather than their  natural values \" which are of order the planck scale .",
    "once the scalar masses are set at these special ( or fine - tuned ) values , we assume that the corrections to @xmath17 arising from other particles present in the model do not exceed the physical mass of @xmath23 .",
    "a positive mass parameter turning negative via rge flow leads to dimensional transmutation as can be seen in a coleman - weinberg @xcite analysis of the effective potential .",
    "the rge evolution that we employ is in one to one correspondence with the effective potential , where the minimization is performed at a momentum scale close to the mass of the higgs scalar .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sm and type - i ] , we discuss the absence of such radiative ewsb in sm and type - i seesaw model . even though such a mechanism fails for type - i seesaw models , in sec .",

    "[ sec : universal seesaw ] , we study the radiative ewsb for a universal seesaw model . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "the mechanism of radiative ewsb occurs when the renormalization group flow of higgs mass parameter @xmath24 receives enough negative contribution from various parameters of the model turning the positive quantity into a negative one while evolving from high to low energies .",
    "unfortunately such can not be the case in the sm .",
    "the higgs potential of the sm is given by : @xmath25 and the renormalization group equation ( rge ) of mass parameter @xmath24 is given by @xcite : @xmath26 the evolution of the higgs mass parameter @xmath24 is dominated by the gauge couplings and the top quark yukawa couplings .",
    "however , these corrections are proportional to @xmath17 itself , which implies that a positive @xmath17 can not turn into negative @xmath17 in rge evolution making radiative ewsb an impossibility within sm .    for type - i seesaw models ,",
    "the additional lagrangian is given by : @xmath27 this part of the lagrangian manages to contribute in the renormalization group flow as it adds a new term to the rge of higgs mass parameter : @xmath28 unfortunately , the contributions coming from the @xmath16 fields make the situation worse as they only strengthen the positivity of the mass parameter as it evolves from high to low energies .",
    "one should also notice that if we want to use the criterion of naturalness , ie .",
    "the correction to the higgs mass parameter @xmath29 the scale of the majorana mass of the right - handed neutrino should not exceed @xmath30 @xcite .    in supersymmetry , the radiative ewsb becomes successful @xcite as the scalar partners of the fermions contribute significantly in the renormalization group flow of the higgs mass parameter in the right direction , making the positive term negative as it evolves from high to low energies .",
    "similar incidents occur in other extensions of sm such as type - ii seesaw models where tev scale particle(s ) manages to dominate the renormalization group flow and turn the positive value of the higgs mass parameter into negative value triggering radiative ewsb .",
    "a common feature of these extensions is the presence of new scalar(s ) at the tev scale as we show in the next five sections .",
    "while type - i seesaw needs right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos which are neutral under the standard model gauge group with large majorana masses , the minimal type - ii seesaw mechanism requires the existence of a weak scalar triplet .",
    "the most natural source for such triplets is provided by the left - right symmetric theories which can be realized either at low energy or can be embedded in grand unified theories ( guts ) such as @xmath7 or @xmath31 . here",
    "we study the potential radiative ewsb scenario of the type - ii seesaw extension of the sm .",
    "we consider the possibility that the weak scalar triplet @xmath32 is the only low - energy remnant of the new physics beyond the sm and the neutral component @xmath33 acquires a very small induced vev at low energy .",
