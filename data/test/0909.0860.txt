    "compared to convection in ordinary one  component fluids the spatiotemporal properties of binary fluids are far more complex .",
    "the evolution of the concentration field is governed by the interplay of typically strong nonlinear convective transport and mixing , weak dissipative solutal diffusion , and the soret effect @xcite .",
    "the soret effect generates concentration gradients in response to the externally applied temperature difference and to local temperature gradients .",
    "the strength of the soret coupling is measured by the dimensionless separation ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the driving mechanisms are therefore controlled by the rayleigh number @xmath1 , measuring the temperature stress , and by the separation ratio , i.e. the solutal driving .    in the present paper we focus on 2dimensional ( 2d )",
    "convective structures consisting of straight parallel rolls in one lateral direction , and 3dimensional ( 3d ) structures that look like a nonlinear superposition of two perpendicular roll sets .",
    "these structures exist at positive separation ratios @xmath2 and arise from a stationary supercritical bifurcation either directly out of the ground state or out of a primary convective state .    at onset , the convection is driven mainly by the solutal gradient established via the soret effect",
    ". therefore this regime is called soret regime in the literature , see e.  g.  @xcite .",
    "the stable convection structure is typically a 3d pattern with square symmetry .    for larger rayleigh numbers the concentration homogenizes and the fluid behaves more like a pure fluid .",
    "convection is now driven mainly by temperature gradients .",
    "the stable convection pattern is a 2d roll pattern .    in the intermediate regime , where the stability changes from stationary squares to stationary rolls",
    ", there exists another 3d structure , the so  called crossroll pattern .",
    "this structure bifurcates out of the stable square branch and merges with the roll branch at higher @xmath1 .",
    "finally , for slow solutal diffusion , the competition between rolls and squares leads to an oscillating behavior in an interval of heating rates around the bifurcation point from squares to crossrolls .",

    "the numerical analysis @xcite elucidating the influence of the spatiotemporal behavior of the concentration field on various properties of convective states for negative and positive separation ratio has clearly shown that the success of a model description sensitively hinges upon the representation of the concentration field .",
    "the representation has to capture the essence of the spatiotemporal structures following from the combined action of strong nonlinear advection and weak diffusion on one hand and the generation of soret induced concentration currents by temperature gradients on the other hand .    for @xmath2 a model with few degrees of freedom that reproduces all essentials of the bifurcation behavior of the flow amplitude",

    "[ fig : bif_diagram_few ] , results for the few  mode model are plotted for three different lewis numbers in the interesting range of heating rates where the transition between small  amplitude stable squares in the soret regime and higher  amplitude stable rolls in the rayleigh regime takes place .",

    "are thus represented by two curves marked by up and down triangles respectively .",
    "the crossrolls bifurcate out of the square branch with equal amplitude but their difference grows with growing @xmath76 until @xmath98 meets the roll branch and @xmath99 becomes zero . the plot has been calculated for @xmath100 but it does not change qualitatively and hardly quantitatively for the values of @xmath101 considered below .    the second plot shows the real eigenvalues tied to the stationary instabilities for the same value of @xmath101 .",

    "the stationary bifurcation properties of the few  mode galerkin model , and in particular the sequence of stable squares , stable crossrolls , and stable rolls agree well with experimental and theoretical results for the system @xcite for not too small @xmath101 .",

    "compared to the ebc results the ranges of existence for all occurring patterns are nearly the same . only the phase space boundary between rolls and crossrolls that sensitively hinges on the model size",
    "is shifted significantly .",
    "there is no qualitative difference in the location of the oscillatory region as found in the few  mode model .",

    "this paper presents results of a new few  mode galerkin model for rayleigh  bnard convection in binary mixtures with positive separation ratio . with only 16 modes it is able to produce bifurcation and phase diagrams similar to those found in experiment or stemming from much more extensive simulations .",
    "in particular , it reproduces a sequence of stable squares , crossrolls , and rolls .",
    "the success of this model is based on and is due to a carefully chosen concentration field ansatz .",
    "this ansatz was obtained from comparisons with multi  mode simulations .",
    "we used an approximation to the impermeability boundary condition allowing us to keep the number of temperature field modes at a minimum .",
    "the concentration field ansatz then fulfills the impermeability condition at the plates in a strict sense only for the quiescent conductive state .",
    "comparisons between results of multi  mode galerkin simulations for rolls and squares using exact and approximated boundary conditions show that both lead to essentially the same concentration field in the bulk .",

    "this is an interesting result as former theoretical models with permeable boundary conditions lead to very different features .",
    "it appears that the impermeability condition for the conductive state is the most important condition to fulfill .    in the few  mode model",
    ", we found stable squares and unstable rolls bifurcating out of the quiescent conductive state for a wide range of parameters .",
    "a transition to stable rolls at higher temperature differences ( rayleigh regime ) happens via a crossroll pattern .",
    "this pattern bifurcates forward out of the squares and merges with the rolls at larger @xmath76 .",
    "previous few  mode models also show an intermediate regime between soret and rayleigh regime , but the behavior of the system was different from the simulations .",
    "the results for the phase diagrams prove the success of our model , as we have found qualitatively similar stability domains for the stationary structures . while our model fails to generate oscillating crossrolls as they appear in multi ",
