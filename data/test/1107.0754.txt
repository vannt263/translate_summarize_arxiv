    "on the whole , measurements of observables in the @xmath3 system agree with the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "however , some cracks have started to appear .",
    "there are now several quantities whose measured values differ from the predictions of the sm .",
    "although these disagreements are not statistically significant  they are typically at the level of @xmath4  they are intriguing since there are a number of different @xmath3 decays and effects involved , and they all appear in @xmath5 transitions .",
    "because of this , there have been numerous papers examining new - physics ( np ) flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) contributions to the various @xmath5 processes .",
    "these analyses have been performed in the context of specific np models , or model - independently .    in general",
    ", such np can also contribute to fcnc processes involving the top quark .",
    "this has been looked at , though much less so than in @xmath3 decays .",
    "however , given that the lhc will produce a large number of top quarks and will be able to measure flavour - changing @xmath6 decays , it is important to explore the possibility of np contributions to fcncs in the top sector . in the past , analyses have focused on rare top decays such as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "other top decays where np effects have been examined include @xmath10  @xcite and @xmath11  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the decay @xmath12 . in the sm",
    ", this decay occurs at tree level , via @xmath13 . on the other hand , because it involves the small element @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix , the amplitude for this process is also rather small , and is therefore quite sensitive to np .",
    "for example , there could be np contributions to this decay in models with a charged higgs boson  @xcite , or via @xmath16 , where @xmath17 corresponds to some neutral particle ( such as a @xmath18 or a non - sm higgs boson ) .",
    "such processes could interfere with the sm process , leading to observable consequences , even if the intermediate np particle were heavier than the top quark . rather than restricting our attention to any one particular model , we examine np contributions to @xmath19 model - independently ( i.e. ,  using an effective lagrangian ) .",
    "our model - independent treatment of @xmath12 takes into account the effects of the 10 possible four - fermi operators .",
    "these operators contribute to both cp - conserving and cp - violating observables . for the cp - even observables",
    ", we consider the cp - averaged partial width , a forward - backward - like asymmetry , and an asymmetry that depends on the spin of the top quark .",
    "for the cp - odd observables , we note that the decay @xmath19 is dominated by one amplitude in the sm ; i.e. , there is only one weak phase involved . as such",
    ", all cp - violating asymmetries are very suppressed in the sm , so the observation of a non - zero asymmetry would be a smoking - gun signal of np . in this paper , we discuss two types of cp - odd asymmetries : the partial - rate asymmetry ( pra ) and a triple - product asymmetry ( tpa ) .",
    "pras require a strong phase in order to be non - zero .",
    "strong phases can arise due to gluon exchange , but it is expected that such phases will be small since the energies involved are so large .",
    "another source of a strong phase is the width of the @xmath20 . in our calculation",
    ", we ignore qcd - based strong phases and assume that the required strong phase is due entirely to the width of the @xmath20 .",
    "this means that only sm - np interference can lead to a pra . on the other hand ,",
    "in contrast with pras , tpas do not require a strong phase in order to be non - zero .",
    "thus , np - np interference terms can give rise to tpas .",
    "as we will see , tpas generated by sm - np interference tend to be small , but np - np tpas can be large . these are particularly interesting .    we show that the measurement of the partial width by itself can reveal the presence of np .",
    "however , if the np exists , we will want to know its identity , i.e. ,  which of the 10 operators is responsible , and the partial width measurement does not give us this information . in order to do this , it is necessary to measure the other quantities mentioned above .",
    "since the various observables depend differently on the operators , the knowledge of their sizes will give us an idea of which np operators are present .",
    "this will allow us in turn to deduce which model(s ) might be responsible for the observed effects .",
    "although we confine our attention to @xmath12 in this work , we note that most of our results are easily transferable to @xmath21 by the replacement @xmath22 in feynman diagrams and expressions .",
    "since @xmath1 , the branching ratio for @xmath21 is similar to that for @xmath12 , and the two processes would apriori have similar sensitivities to np effects .",
    "one difference between @xmath0 and @xmath21 is that the `` cpt '' correction to the pra would be significant for @xmath21 , whereas it is miniscule for @xmath12 ( see the discussion in sec .",

    "the latter two asymmetries are both constructed in such a way that they are zero within the context of the sm .",
    "we close this section with a brief numerical study , noting that the cp - even asymmetries could reasonably be of order 10 s of percent .",

    "however , the sm amplitude involves the small cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa element @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , and is therefore suppressed . as a result , the decay is quite sensitive to np . rather than working within the context of any one particular extension of the sm , we parameterize the np couplings by an effective lagrangian that includes the 10 possible four - fermi operators .",
    "we show that the sm and np contributions to @xmath12 can indeed be about the same size .",
    "we first compute the @xmath149 partial width in the presence of np . the ratio @xmath43 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rcal ] ) , provides a quantitative measure of the deviation of the partial width from its sm expectation ( @xmath150 in the sm ) .",
    "this shows clearly that this observable is excellent for showing that np is present  significant deviations of @xmath43 from 1 are possible .    on the other hand ,",
    "the partial width is not a good observable to _ identify _ the new physics ",
    "all 10 np operators contribute to @xmath43 in a similar way . in order to get an idea of the type of np present ,",
    "it is necessary to consider other quantities . to this end , we construct two cp - conserving and two cp - violating observables : ( i ) cp - even : a forward - backward - like asymmetry [ @xmath140  eq .",
    "( [ eq : arhobarsq ] ) ] and a top - quark - spin - dependent asymmetry [ @xmath141  eq .",
    "( [ eq : aparallel ] ) ] , ( ii ) cp - odd : the partial rate asymmetry [ @xmath151  eq .  ( [ eq : pra1 ] ) ] and a triple - product asymmetry [ @xmath152  eq .  ( [ eq : atpcpnon - suppressed ] ) ] . in each case , the observable is formulated in such a way that it is zero within the context of the sm .",
    "the key point is that these observables depend on differing combinations of the np parameters .",
    "this gives them different sensitivities to the various lorentz structures present in the np effective lagrangian .",
    "the allowed values of these four observables vary greatly depending on the values of the np parameters , but results in the 10 - 20% range are possible ( see tables [ tab : acpeven ] and [ tab : acptpnpnp ] )",
    ". if np is present , it may well produce measurable values of these observables .",
    "taken together , the measurements of these quantities will give a good indication of the type of np present .",

    "the cpt theorem requires the total decay width for the top to be equal to that for the anti - top .",
    "an apparent violation of the cpt theorem arises , however , if the np contributions in fig .  [ fig : feynman_diagram1 ] ( b ) are the only ones that are kept . that this is the case is straightforward to see , since the diagram in fig .",
