    "with these gas surface density maps , spatial variations of the x - factor were estimated .",
    "in addition , we investigated the relationship between the gas surface density and that of the star formation rate .",
    "these are dealt with in more detail below .",
    "the most important results of this work regarding the x - factor are the following :    1 .",
    "the average x - factor for each galaxy can be estimated from the current observations , even if crudely .",

    "the latter two results are robust to a range of adopted @xmath33 values .",
    "the variation of the x - factor spatially and from source to source could be due , in part , to variations in metallicity .",
    "theoretical work using the observational data also support a dependence of @xmath14 on metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , @xcite do not find a strong correlation of @xmath14 with metallicity .",
    "however , their sample only had a metallicity range of 0.5 - 0.8 dex within factors of  3 of solar .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) typically had metallicities much less than solar , sometimes only a few percent of solar , and found x - factors an order - of - magnitude or more higher than the standard value .",
    "so a strong @xmath14-metallicity relation may exist for galaxies with strongly sub - solar metallicities .",
    "for galaxies with roughly solar metallicities , while metallicity alone is apparently insufficient in constraining @xmath14 , it is still relevant .",
    "for example , using the data points for ngc4321 from the left panel of figure  10 in @xcite yields a correlation coeffient of @xmath510.6 .",
    "this suggests that each galaxy has its own @xmath14-metallicity relationship .",
    "given that sub - solar metallicities imply larger x - factors , perhaps the interarm regions of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  have sub - solar metallicities , while being at solar - level in their arms.51 .",
    "whether this implies the same metallicity in both regions is unclear .",
    "] the models of @xcite , as well as their figure  1 , suggest that the metallicity in the interarm regions would be systematically lower by a factor of @xmath522 - 3 in order to increase @xmath14 by a factor of 2 with respect to that in the spiral arms ( see their equation  # 8) . while observations of metallicity in the ism of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  apparently do not support such a systemically lower metallicity between their spiral arms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they also do not rule it out : such observations are toward hii regions and are heavily biased toward the spiral arms .",
    "this could , in turn , affect the results of studies of the effects of the spiral arms on star formation .",
    "@xcite , for example , looked at whether the sfr normalized to the molecular gas surface density is higher in the spiral arms of three galaxies .",
    "they adopted a spatially constant x - factor , which , to within a factor of 2 , is likely correct .",
    "this will be discussed further in section  [ sfrgsd ] .",
    "the modelling by @xcite mentioned above suggests that the x - factor depends mainly on the metallicity of the gas in a galaxy and , to a lesser extent , on the average co surface brightness .",
    "using the roughly solar metallicities of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the observed co brightnesses from the data used here , and applying expression  ( 8) of @xcite yields @xmath53 for m@xmath051  and @xmath54 to 6@xmath55 for m@xmath083 ; this is much higher than the observed values found in the current work .",
    "admittedly , our estimates are uncertain by factors of about 2 .",
    "nevertheless , our estimate of @xmath56 for m@xmath051  agrees with the result of @xcite who find @xmath57 from using the observed extinction in hii regions .",
    "accordingly , the theoretical models need further adjustments .",
    "as mentioned previously , there is evidence that adopting a spatially constant x - factor does not account for co - dark gas .",
    "for example , table  [ tab3 ] suggests that about half the total gas mass is unaccounted for when using the co  @xmath9 and hi  21-cm spectral lines ( see section  [ xfac ] and appendix  [ appgsdm ] ) . if we adopt a threshold for co - dark gas that corresponds to an @xmath14 that is a factor of 4 higher than the average for each galaxy , then some of the edges of the shaded regions of figures  [ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] indicate such gas .",
    "it is worth noting that these edges are well within the boundaries of the co maps .",
    "of course , possible alternative interpretations for the high x - factor or its high lower limits are not entirely ruled out .",
    "these include the following :    * an extended low surface brightness artifact in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum maps of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . * insufficient mapping of co  @xmath9 in the outer disks of these galaxies . * dust with unusual properties such as unusually high dust - mass absorption coefficient ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) and/or a high dust - to - gas mass ratio . * optically thick hi 21-cm emission",
    "each of the above could mimic the presence of co - dark gas .",
    "the first alternative is unlikely given that the simulations of the _ aztec _ 1.1@xmath0 mm observations have accurately accounted for any constant offsets in the m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  maps .",
    "the second alternative is unlikely because there is evidence for such co - dark gas seen at radii well within the boundaries of the existing co maps , as mentioned previously .",
    "the third alternative is unlikely because having a combination of high @xmath31 and high @xmath58 would not be sufficient for positions with @xmath14 two orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the fourth alternative is a partly valid explanation for co - dark gas in our galaxy according to the @xcite .",
    "they estimated that up to half of the dark gas could be due to optically thick hi 21-cm emission . even if that were the case for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083",
    ", it would not account for lower limits to @xmath14 that are one or two orders of magnitude higher than the average inner disk value .    in short ,",
    "none of the alternatives mentioned above are likely to entirely rule out co - dark gas .",
    "nevertheless , these alternatives themselves are _ not _ entirely ruled out either and could partly account for some of the high x - factor values inferred . in any event ,",
    "_ more and deeper mapping of co and other gas tracers of the outer disks of these galaxies is essential for understanding the nature of the dust and gas at these large galactocentric radii . _",
    "the existence of co - dark gas in our galaxy has been known for a while ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and has been confirmed recently by the @xcite .",
    "they find @xmath59 for our galaxy .",
    "also , as mentioned previously there is much additional evidence for such gas in the galaxy and external galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "so it is quite likely that there is co - dark gas in both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 .",
    "indeed , the current observations suggest that such gas is present in the outer disks of both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083",
    ". the co - dark gas could account for as much as half of the total gas mass , although the alternative interpretations given above could reduce that fraction by roughly 50% .      in section  [ sfvgsd ]",
    ", we examined how the sfr varied with the gas surface density in a number of ways .",
    "comparing between the continuum and spectral line tracers given in figure  [ fig18 ] , all show higher slopes for the continuum tracers than for the spectral - line tracers .",
    "figures  [ fig5a ] and [ fig6a ] illustrate that the continuum - derived radial profile of the gas surface density is flatter than that for the spectral - line derived gas surface for large galactocentric radii . having a smaller range of gas surface densities",
    "will naturally increase the slope in the sfr versus gas surface density plots .    even though @xcite used far - uv and 24@xmath35 data to estimate the sfr , whereas we used h@xmath60 and 24@xmath35 ,",
    "that is unlikely to account for the difference between their fitted slopes and ours ; their figure  9 makes such a comparison and the difference in fitted slopes between the two sfr tracers is 10% or less .",
    "so if differences in sfr tracers can not explain the difference between the slope obtained by @xcite and those obtained in the current work , then it must be the difference in gas surface density tracer .",
    "the continuum tracer used here gives slopes of @xmath61 , which is consistent with the eyeball inspection of the far upper right panel of figure  8 of @xcite for the inner @xmath62 radius of m@xmath083 .",
    "estimation of gas surface or column densities is problematic because , as exemplified in the current work , different tracers can yield different results .",
    "there are systematics that affect the column density estimates using co  @xmath9 and different systematics when using infrared and millimetre continuum .",
    "these systematics yield the differing slopes and also the observed scatter , which is sometimes quite large with _ reduced _ chi - square as high as @xmath63 to 70 .",
    "this scatter is partly intrinsic , because the sfr depends on more physical conditions than on just column density . but",
    "systematic errors in estimating surface densities also play a role .",
    "corrections applied systematically to those errors would represent a smooth gradient with galactocentric radius and not simply corrections to a few individual points .",
    "for example , observations have inferred x - factor values that are factors of about 5 or more lower than the standard value ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the centres of external galaxies as well as in the central region of our own galaxy @xcite .",
    "but these centres only represent the central few hundred parsec radii and would thus represent very few points in the plots of figure  [ fig18 ] . only a large , smooth gradient in parameters like the x - factor or",
    "@xmath33 would change the slope uniformly in those plots , and there is no evidence for such .",
    "nevertheless , there is evidence of a weak dependence of the x - factor on the sfr .",
    "@xcite explored this possibility with their physical models of molecular clouds , finding that @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "the systematically different power - law indices for the dust tracers from those for the gas tracers are reconcilable by adopting that relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath19 .",
    "the computation of appendix  [ appxfsfr ] yields @xmath66 and @xmath67 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , respectively .",
    "these have uncertainties of 3 - 4% and are thus significantly different from that of the models of @xcite .",
    "these are more consistent with the models of @xcite(see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that the m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  @xmath68 values are significantly different from each other argues that there is no universal relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is not surprising given that both of those quantities have complex dependences on the physical structure within the molecular gas .",
    "the value of the slope of the surface densities of sfr versus those of the molecular gas is an indication of the large - scale evolution of a galaxy . as briefly alluded to previously , following",
    "the `` stream '' of points in each of the panels of figure  [ fig18 ] from low to high surface densities is equivalent to travelling from large to small galactocentric radii .",
    "the @xmath69 ( or alternatively @xmath70 $ ] ) ratio is really the inverse depletion time of the molecular gas . for slope @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the gas",
    "is depleted uniformly throughout a galaxy , as pointed out by @xcite and found by them and @xcite",
    ". however , _ all _ the panels of figure  [ fig18 ] have slopes @xmath73 , strongly supporting an inside - out depletion of molecular gas in both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 .",
    "the panels of figures  [ fig19 ] and [ fig20 ] yield molecular gas depletion times from their centres out to radii of about 8@xmath0kpc for m@xmath051  and 6@xmath0kpc for m@xmath083 . for m@xmath051 ,",
    "the continuum tracers give molecular gas depletion times of about 1.2@xmath0gyr in the centre to 20@xmath0gyr in the outer disk and , with the co line tracer , these times are 0.8 to 2.5@xmath0gyr .",
    "for m@xmath083 , the continuum tracers suggest depletion times of about 0.7@xmath0gyr in the centre to 10@xmath0gyr in the outer disk and , again for co , these times are about 0.4 to 5@xmath0gyr .",
    "this inside - out evolution of the star formation in the disks of galaxies is supported by the visible - light observations of @xcite .    at radii from about 8@xmath0kpc to 11@xmath0kpc for m@xmath051 , the molecular gas depletion times at these radii extend by nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the 20@xmath0gyr estimate for galactocentric radius of 8@xmath0kpc . for m@xmath083",
    ", this extension of the gas depletion time occurs for radii slightly beyond 6@xmath0kpc and is by about 1.5 orders of magnitude .",
    "figures  [ fig19 ] and [ fig20 ] are equivalent to figure  5 of @xcite , displaying the inverse depletion times of the molecular gas in the form of images of entire galaxies . those images in the current paper ( and , to some extent , those of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are suggestive of spiral structure .",
    "such spiral structure implies an enhancement of the sfr due to the spiral arms beyond that of arms simply collecting and compressing gas and dust .",
    "accordingly , we subjected these images to spiral arm fourier analysis and found only a weak spiral structure with arm / interarm ratios usually within factors of 2 of unity .",
    "the right panels were found to have a spiral structure with high _ interarm _ values of @xmath69 and lower arm values , which is corrected when accounting for the higher interarm @xmath14 ( see section  [ xfac ] ) . in contrast , the left panels were found to have a spiral structure with high @xmath74 $ ] on the arms and lower values between the arms ; the arm / interarm ratios are 1.3 for m@xmath051  and 2.0 for m@xmath083 .",
    "these arm / interarm ratios are at least partly explained by the higher @xmath33 between the arms than in the arms ( see appendix  [ appgsdm]) 18% higher for m@xmath051  and 8% higher for m@xmath083 .",
    "so , conservatively speaking , even the continuum tracer in our work _ confirms the work of @xcite that spiral arms only enhance the star formation rate because of increasing the surface density of gas and dust with _ no _ additional enhancement .",
    "_ the uncertainties in the current work do not permit completely ruling out such an enhancement , but suggest that any such enhancement would be small ( i.e. , a factor of @xmath75 ) .",
    "that enhancement , should it be real , could be accounted for by orbit - crowding in the spiral arms raising the inverse depletion time of the gas in those arms ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "the other reason is that multi - wavelength far - ir data at the long wavelengths ( i.e. @xmath78 ) at which the bulk of the dust mass radiates is not available for the outer disks of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , other than the 160@xmath35 data of _",
    "spitzer_.    another model - independent approach was to constrain , at least roughly , the @xmath33 at 1.1@xmath0 mm by the observations , rather than simply adopting a dust mass absorption coefficient , @xmath79 .",
    "gas column densities were estimated by calibrating against hi - dominant positions to estimate the dust optical depth to gas column density ratio @xmath33 .",
    "the method of calibrating against the hi - dominant positions was improved by crudely estimating the effects of the co - dark gas ( see below ) .",
    "neither galaxy has a strong radial variation in the gas surface density beyond galactocentric radii of about 3@xmath0kpc .",
    "out to a galactocentric radius of 14@xmath0kpc , the best estimate of the mass of gas in m@xmath051  is @xmath4 . out to 12@xmath0kpc in m@xmath083 , this best estimate is @xmath5 .",
    "( see adopted distances in table  [ tab1 ] . )",
    "pre - existing maps of co  @xmath9 permitted the creation of maps of the @xmath6 or x - factor for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083out to galactocentric radii of 6 - 8@xmath0kpc . both galaxies have x - factor values that are higher in the _ inter_arm than in the arms by a factor of @xmath7 - 2 . in the central few kiloparsecs of m@xmath051 ,",
    "this interarm / arm ratio rises to @xmath80 . in m@xmath051",
    ", there is no significant radial variation of @xmath14 . in m@xmath083 , however , there is evidence at the many-@xmath81 level of radial variation of the x - factor by factors of 2 to 3 , where the central 2@xmath0kpc radius has a roughly flat x - factor which declines to a minimum at about 4@xmath0kpc . within galactocentric",
    "radii @xmath82 - 8@xmath0kpc , the spatially averaged x - factor is about 1@xmath55 .",
    "beyond the outer radius of the x - factor map for each galaxy , comparison of the radial profile of the gas surface density derived from the continuum with those of the surface brightnesses of co and hi permits estimates of lower limits of the x - factor that reach one to two orders of magnitude higher than the inner disk values .",
    "this suggests the existence of co - dark molecular gas in the outer disks of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , although alternative explanations are only partly ruled out .",

    ". a two - dimensional fourier analysis of the spiral structure at 1.1@xmath0 mm and at visible ( or near visible ) wavelengths revealed that the spiral structure in red light and that in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum and were the same in m@xmath051 .",
    "for m@xmath083 , the spiral structure in @xmath46-band compared with that in the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum showed that the bar s effect in m@xmath083  is conspicuous in @xmath46-band and not at 1.1@xmath0 mm .",
    "these results suggest that the spiral density wave in m@xmath051  is influencing the interstellar medium and stars similarly , while the bar potential in m@xmath083  has a different influence on the interstellar medium from that on the stars .",
    "log - log plots of the star formation rate surface densities against those of the gas traced by spectral lines ( i.e. , of hi and co ) had slopes of @xmath7 whether total gas or just molecular gas surface density . for the plots with gas surface densities traced by the continuum emission ,",
    "the slopes were @xmath61 whether total gas ( using continuum only ) or just molecular ( using continuum with hi subtracted ) gas surface densities .",
    "these plots , especially with the continuum tracers , show a threshold gas surface density at which the sfr rises by two or more orders of magnitude .",
    "the existence of this threshold gas surface density is insensitive to within a factor of @xmath523 for the adopted @xmath33 .",
    "the value of this threshold density is @xmath83 .",
    "this threshold is somewhat less conspicuous in the spectral line tracers than for the continuum tracers .",
    "the fitted slopes suggest that the depletion of the molecular gas occurs first at small galactocentric radii and then at increasing radii in an inside - out galactic evolution .",
    "this is seen more clearly in maps of the ratio of the surface densities of the sfr to that of the molecular gas .",
    "for both these galaxies and the continuum tracer , the molecular gas depletion time in the centres is about 1@xmath0gyr , rising at radii of 6 - 8@xmath0kpc to around 10 - 20@xmath0gyr .",
    "further out , the depletion times rise by one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "the spectral line tracer , i.e. co  @xmath9 , suggests molecular gas depletion times in the outer disks that are appreciably less than 10 - 20@xmath0gyr .",
    "the images of the inverse depletion time show signs of spiral structure . superficially",
    ", this suggests that spiral arms effect the sfr beyond just heightening the gas surface density .",
    "however , correcting for the x - factor spatial variation and for the spatial variation of the @xmath33 removes or nearly removes such spiral structure .",
    "this apparently confirms the result of @xcite that the arms merely heighten the sfr in the same proportion as they heighten the gas surface density .",
    "greater spatial resolution is required for confirming this result .",
    "in the future , we need deeper mapping of molecular tracers in the outer disks of these spiral galaxies . as well , a better method of calibrating the @xmath33 at millimetre wavelengths is needed .",
    "so far , the method employed in the current work is functional , but only crudely .",
    "either a new method or refinement of the method described here is necessary .",
    "consultations with rich rand , divakara mayya , daniel rosa are greatly appreciated .",

    "the outer edge to the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum emission of m@xmath051  lies at a galactocentric radius of about 14@xmath0kpc and for m@xmath083  it is about 12@xmath0kpc .",
    "the derived fluxes are @xmath84 for m@xmath051  and @xmath85 for m@xmath083  to those outer edges .",
    "the uncertainties include the calibration uncertainty of 13% and the uncertainties due to the somewhat arbitrary choices for outer boundaries .",
    "the simulations were used to check for systematics in the flux determination , thereby providing correction factors for the derived fluxes . for m@xmath051 , this correction factor was 1.5 for m@xmath051  and 0.9 for m@xmath083 .",
    "these corrections were included in the previously quoted flux values .",
    "the 1.1@xmath0 mm continuum surface - brightness maps of figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] were ratioed with the _ spitzer / mips _ 160@xmath35 , effectively 155.9@xmath35 , maps of m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  @xcite to produce temperature maps under the assumption that the dust emissivity index , @xmath32 , was 2.0 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , this was the most appropriate value for @xmath32 as found from the observations of @xmath86 by @xcite .",
    "_ in practice , the adopted value for @xmath32 will have only a small effect on the derived gas column densities , provided that those derived column densities are calibrated against observed gas column densities . _ by using those positions where atomic gas dominated the column densities to calibrate the @xmath33 for the continuum - derived column densities , it was found that the column densities derived from the continuum data for @xmath87 to 2.5 did not deviate by more than 30% from those for @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , observations at only two wavelengths are necessary for a reasonable approximation of the gas surface density map .",
    "the @xmath33 derived from the hi comparisons are 2.2-@xmath89 for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 , respectively . these values lead to gas mass estimates that appear to be too low ( see sections  [ xfac ] , [ xfsv ] , and below in this appendix for details ) .",
    "@xcite simply adopted the dust mass - absorption coefficient of @xcite and @xcite , which is a factor of @xmath90 smaller than the values determined here .",
    "@xcite also determined a higher dust - to - gas mass ratio than that adopted here .",
    "this is equivalent to adopting a @xmath33 that is factors of 5.0 - 5.3 smaller than that derived from the hi comparisons .",
    "because we adopt a constant dust - to - gas ratio , the two @xmath33 cases are referred to as the high-@xmath31 ( from hi comparisons ) and low-@xmath31 @xcite cases .",
    "given the low masses that result from the high-@xmath31 case , the hi comparisons must be appropriately modified .",
    "the hi comparisons were repeated after removing upper outliers that are apparently unreliable due to possible undetected gas .",
    "this results in an intermediate case , where a @xmath33 that is a factor of two lower than that from the simple atomic gas calibration method is found . unless otherwise stated , all masses and surface densities quoted are for this intermediate-@xmath33 ( most realistic ) case .",
    "this approach yields a roughly 50% uncertainty in column density and mass estimates , using @xmath91 .",
    "the surface brightness at frequency @xmath92 , @xmath93 , is related to the dust - derived gas column density , @xmath94 , by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the mean atomic weight per hydrogen atom , @xmath97 is the mass of a hydrogen atom , @xmath58 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio , and @xmath31 is the dust mass absorption coefficient .",
    "the mass - absorption coefficient varies with frequency as follows : @xmath98 in which @xmath99 is dust mass - absorption coefficient at a reference frequency @xmath100 .",
    "the dust temperature , @xmath101 , is of course estimated by evaluating expression  ( [ eq1 ] ) at frequency @xmath102 , corresponding to the wavelength of 1.1@xmath0 mm for the _ jcmt / aztec _ observations , and again at frequency @xmath103 , corresponding to the wavelength of 155.9@xmath35 for the _ spitzer / mips _ observations , and taking the ratio of the two . as well as using the maps at the two wavelengths ( i.e. the _ jcmt / aztec _ at 1.1@xmath0 mm and the _ spitzer / mips _ map at 155.9@xmath35 ) , there are many additional details involved in estimating the column densities , @xmath94 .",
    "these include estimating the value of @xmath33 ( or the product of @xmath58 and @xmath31 ) , convolving the _ aztec _",
    "1.1@xmath0 mm map to the resolution of the _ spitzer / mips _ 155.9@xmath35 map , estimating the noise levels in the maps , characterizing any systematic effects introduced into the @xmath101 and @xmath94 maps due to the observations and processing of the _ aztec _ data , and any relevant colour corrections to the continuum data . in particular , a constant offset correction of @xmath104-@xmath105 must be added to the column densities for m@xmath051  as dictated by the simulations to correct for inadequately recovering the large - scale emission ( but was not applied to the figures ) .",
    "there are a couple issues that should be addressed in discussing the reliability of gas surface densities and masses as inferred from dust emission in the current work .",
    "one issue is to what level calibration differences between that of _ spitzer / mips _ and that of _ herschel / pacs _ for their 160@xmath35 data would affect the results and conclusions of the current work ( see * ? ? ?",
    "another issue is the validity of the simple approach used here instead of using a more detailed dust model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as for the former issue , @xcite compared the 160@xmath35 data for both instruments and characterized their systematic differences .",
    "depending on the calibration scheme used , the _ herschel / pacs _ 160@xmath35 intensities were either 1.6% or 25% systematically higher than those for _",
    "spitzer / mips_. scaling up the 160@xmath35 intensities used in the current work by 25% would increase the computed dust temperatures , but by differing amounts depending on initial computed temperature .",
    "most of the those temperatures were determined to be between 10@xmath0k and 23@xmath0k .",
    "after the hypothetical correction , those would be 10.3@xmath0k and 25@xmath0k .",
    "if there were no calibration of the column densities against other data , those corrected temperatures would require the column densities to be corrected downwards by 5% and 11% , respectively .",
    "the warmer positions in both galaxies tend to have higher column densities .",
    "so the higher column densities would be corrected downwards by more than the lower column densities , on average .",
    "this reduces the dynamic range of the determined column densities by roughly 6% .",
    "the overall scaling of those column densities would remain unchanged because of the calibration against hi column densities .",
    "so , such a correction , were it necessary , would not appreciably change the current results .    as for the second issue",
    ", the models of @xcite combined with data at mid - ir and far - ir wavelengths can provide estimates of a number of parameters .",
    "for the current work , however , there are two reasons why such an approach was not used .",
    "one reason is that , as mentioned in the introduction , the _ aztec _",
    "1.1@xmath0 mm map has more spatial coverage than the _ herschel _ data for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 . _",
    "spitzer _ does have sufficient spatial coverage for comparison with the _ aztec _ data , but does not have the long - wavelength data that probes the bulk of the dust mass , other than at 160@xmath35 .",
    "so , to consistently treat each entire galaxy , the _ aztec _",
    "1.1@xmath0 mm data were combined with the _ spitzer _ 160@xmath35 data for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 .",
    "another reason that the more model - dependent approach was not used is that we need to have model - independent tests that can confirm or refute the validity of the models , as stated recently by @xcite .",
    "the current work , for example , finds a dust opacity to gas column density ratio @xmath33 at 1.1@xmath0 mm that is about double that inferred from @xcite .",
    "but temporarily adopting the @xmath33 of @xcite and adopting the appropriate distance yields nearly identical masses for both the more sophistocated approach ( i.e. , in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the simpler approach ( i.e. , the current work ) for the ngc@xmath05194 field .",
    "this strongly suggests that the simpler approach of the current work is reasonable at recovering some basic dust properties .",
    "the dust optical depth to gas column density ratio , @xmath33 , and especially the dust mass absorption coeffient , @xmath31 , can be quite uncertain , ranging from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "( see the following for examples of disparate values : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . accordingly ,",
    "attempting to measure @xmath33 observationally could narrow the uncertainty .",
    "this is most easily observed in gas dominated by atomic hydrogen because the gas column densities are easy to determine .",
    "another approach was followed by @xcite for observations of the galaxies m@xmath099 and m@xmath0100 in which they plotted the star formation rate surface density , @xmath19 , against gas surface density and against that for dust , adjusting the @xmath31 until both surface densities agree at large @xmath19 .",
    "this resulted in a @xmath31 value corresponding to the unusually low @xmath108 mentioned above .",
    "the large @xmath33 initially derived in the current work was from comparing the observed optical depths at 1.1@xmath0 mm with the observed gas column densities in regions dominated by atomic gas .",
    "the @xcite observed @xmath34 at 857@xmath0ghz and @xmath36 at 250@xmath35 in the dust associated with the hi gas within the galaxy .",
    "the @xcite also observed @xmath109 at 250@xmath35 for the dust associated with molecular gas , which is about double that observed for dust associated with atomic gas , remembering that the @xmath110 is the column density of hydrogen _",
    "nuclei_. at a wavelength of 1.1@xmath0 mm , these numbers correspond to @xmath111 and @xmath112 for dust associated with hi and @xmath113 for that associated with h@xmath41 ( using a spectral emissivity index of @xmath38 for the galaxy , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the current work initially finds @xmath114 for m@xmath051  and @xmath115 for m@xmath083  for dust along lines of sight with gas column densities dominated by @xmath116 .",
    "this is more than double the values observed in our galaxy and are even 40% larger than the dust associated with @xmath117 in our galaxy .",
    "this large @xmath33 is suspect and requires a re - evaluation of the calibration of @xmath33 at 1.1@xmath0 mm .",
    "one explanation for the observed large @xmath33 would be co - dark gas . the presence of such gas can be crudely tested .",
    "this is done by starting with dust - derived gas column densities , @xmath94 , that are only roughly calibrated ",
    "i.e. , to within a factor of a few .",
    "the difference @xmath118 then provides a rough measure of molecular gas column density .",
    "the ratio @xmath119 ( where the @xmath14 is the average used for each galaxy ) is a crude measure of the amount of dark gas  a _ dark _ ratio .",
    "then @xmath33 can be recomputed using only those positions with dark ratios less than some upper limit . choosing a dark ratio upper limit as high as 100 reduces the derived @xmath33 by a few percent , while choosing unity yields a @xmath33 that is a factor of about 4 lower .",
    "the latter is risky given that this could unnecessarily exclude too many positions with very little dark gas .",
    "accordingly , a more conservative correction factor would be around 2 .    reducing the @xmath33 value by this factor scales up the column densities by the same factor and the x - factor scales in proportion to @xmath118 , or up by a factor of @xmath523 for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 .",
    "the best estimates of these values are hence @xmath120 , corresponding to @xmath121 for @xmath122 for both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 .",
    "these are well within a factor of 2 of the values found by the @xcite for our galaxy .",
    "the best estimates for the x - factors for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  are around 1@xmath55 .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] displays the best estimated values for the gas masses and the x - factors .",
    "that table shows that roughly half of the total mass of the gas is unaccounted for using spectral lines .",
    "this is discussed further in section  [ xfsv ] .",
    "possible spatial variations in @xmath33 should also be considered .",
    "both m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  show _",
    "de_creases in @xmath33 by about 15 - 20% in going from galactocentric radii of 1 or 2@xmath0kpc to about 6 or 7@xmath0kpc . correcting for the co - dark gas changes this result .",
    "the problem is that the numbers of points used in the comparisons becomes very small ( i.e. @xmath123 ) when the upper limit to the dark ratio is reduced .",
    "such small numbers do not give reliable estimates of @xmath33 .",
    "so the radial spatial variation of @xmath33 is uncertain , although there is no clear evidence that it has a strong radial variation . in going from interarm positions to spiral arm positions , the @xmath33 in m@xmath051  decreases by 18% . in m@xmath083",
    ", this decrease is 8% .",
    "again , correcting for the co - dark gas changes these results to 25% for m@xmath051  and an 11% _ in_crease for m@xmath083 , although the number of points available for the estimation is not really sufficient .",
    "the x - factor , @xmath14 , can be straightforwardly computed from @xmath124 given that @xmath94 , @xmath11 , and @xmath125 are all maps , @xmath14 is also a map , but not a very extended map because of the mounting uncertainties that result from the numerous computations with pre - existing data required to reach @xmath14 .",
    "both the m@xmath051  and m@xmath083  @xmath14 maps do not extend beyond about 7@xmath0kpc from the centre of each map , mostly because the co maps do not extend further than that .",
    "figures  [ fig13 ] , [ fig13a ] , [ fig14 ] , and [ fig14a ] show the x - factor maps and radial profiles for m@xmath051  and m@xmath083 .",
    "the mean values of the x - factor listed in table  [ tab5 ] , which we call @xmath126 , are the @xmath127-weighted means of each @xmath14 map and only really applies to the central 7@xmath0kpc radius in each galaxy .",
    "given that the co  @xmath9 emission falls to the noise level at a radius of about 7 to 8@xmath0kpc , we are unable to compute @xmath14 beyond that in the outer disks .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the radial curves of figures  [ fig5a ] and [ fig6a ] to infer rough lower limits on @xmath14 in the outer disks .",
    "the radial variation of @xmath14 with respect to the mean value in the inner disk , @xmath126 , is a simple variation on expression  ( [ eq5 ] ) : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the molecular gas column density estimated from a spatially constant x - factor : @xmath130 .",
    "this measure of the column density is very noisy in these observations of the outer disks and a useful proxy is necessary for inferring some crude lower limit on @xmath131 for radii beyond 8@xmath0kpc .",
    "the proxy adopted for @xmath132 was a pessimistic estimate of the 3-sigma uncertainties of the gas column density , i.e. , @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "this gives the most conservative ( i.e. least extreme ) estimates for @xmath131 beyond a radius of 8@xmath0kpc .",
    "for m@xmath051 , even in the high-@xmath31 ( low-@xmath31 ) case , the above proxy yields lower limits to @xmath14 of roughly @xmath134 to @xmath135 ( @xmath136 to @xmath137 ) depending on the radius in the outer disk . for m@xmath083 , even in the high-@xmath31 ( low-@xmath31 ) case , these rough lower limits to @xmath14 are @xmath138 to @xmath139 ( @xmath140 to @xmath141 ) .",
    "the logarithm of the sfr surface density is plotted against that of the gas surface density for different tracers of that gas surface density .",
    "the plots of the surface densities of sfr versus gas are displayed in figure  [ fig18 ] .",
    "the uncertainty of each fitted slope is the formal error of the fit and was scaled by the square - root of the reduced chi - square in order to give a more conservative and more realistic estimate of this formal error .",
    "one important consideration in these fits is that the spatial resolution of the m@xmath051  data is limited to 38@xmath42 , because of the _ spitzer _ 160@xmath35 resolution . for m@xmath083",
    "this resolution is 55@xmath42 resolution due to the co observations . given that each point in these plots represents a single pixel , the effective number of independent points in each plot is the number of pixels divided by 20 for m@xmath051  and by 55 for m@xmath083 .",
