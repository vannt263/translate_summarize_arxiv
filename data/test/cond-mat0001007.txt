    "when holes are introduced into the copper oxide planes of high t@xmath3 cuprates , spin and charge correlations change dramatically .",

    "magnetization @xmath0 , measured by @xmath4sr @xcite on e.g. @xmath5 , reveals a qualitative difference between the insulating and superconducting phases : @xmath0 is rather insensitive to doping in the poorly conducting regime @xmath6 , but drops precipitously above the onset of superconductivity at @xmath7 , becoming undetectable at optimal doping @xmath8 .",
    "theoretically , holes can cause _ dilution _ and _ frustration _ in the heisenberg antiferromagnet , which create spin textures : either random ( `` spin glass '' ) or with ordering wavevector away from @xmath9 ( sometimes called `` stripes'')@xcite .",
    "however , the apparent reduction of local magnetization by the onset of superonductivity , is a novel and poorly understood effect .",
    "theory must go beyond purely magnetic models , and involve the superconducting degrees of freedom .",
    "we find that this problem is amenable to a variational approach , using hole - doped resonating valence bonds ( rvb ) states .",
    "the rvb states were originally suggested by anderson to describe the spin and charge correlations in the high @xmath10 cuprates@xcite .",
    "they are excellent trial wave functions for the doped mott insulators , with large hubbard repulsion @xmath11 since:(i ) configurations with doubly occupied sites are excluded.(ii ) marshall s sign criterion for the magnetic energy@xcite is satisfied , and heisenberg ground state energy and antiferromagnetism at zero doping is accurately recovered@xcite .",
    "the hole - doped rvb state is a new class of variational states , in which spin and charge correlations are parameterized independently , without explicit spin nor gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "such parameterization allows states with magnetic and independently d or s - wave superconducting ( off - diagonal ) order or disorder , thus permit an _ unbiased _ determination of ground state spin and charge correlations appropriate for the cuprates .",
    "these are important advantages over commonly used spin density wave , hartree - fock and bcs wavefunctions .",
    "a comprehensive study of the state is performed using monte carlo and mean field calculations .",
    "phenomenological low energy effective hamiltonian is proposed , with two major components : heisenberg interaction for spins , and single or cooper pair hopping kinetic energy for fermion holes .    regarding this model our key results are:(i ) for the magnetic energy alone ,",
    "the local magnetization @xmath0 is _ weakly dependent _ on doping concentration .",
    "this holds independently of inter - hole correlations for either randomly localized or extended states.(ii ) in contrast to ( i ) , @xmath0 is strongly reduced by the kinetic energy of _",
    "cooper pair hopping _ , which correlates the reduction of @xmath0 with the rise of superconducting stiffness , and hence@xcite the transition temperature @xmath10 .",
    "these results agree with the experimentally reported correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath10@xcite .",
    "this relation appears to be _ weakly _ dependent on the precise hole density .",
    "we also find that rvb states have the following properties:(i ) the magnetic energy is correlated with the average loop density:@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the linear size off the lattice.(ii ) the gutzwiller mean field approximation ( ga ) for magnetic correlations is in good agreement with the monte carlo results.(iii ) long range magnetic correlations in rvb states are extremely sensitive to changes in the singlet bond amplitude @xmath14 .",
