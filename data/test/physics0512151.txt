    "the field of atom optics  @xcite has undergone a dramatic expansion in the last two decades , largely as a consequence of the development of laser - cooling techniques  @xcite , and the routine production of atoms at microkelvin temperatures  @xcite .",
    "paramagnetic cold atoms can be manipulated with the stern - gerlach force  @xcite .",
    "to date , the stern - gerlach force has been used to realise a variety of atomic mirrors for both cold @xcite and bose condensed atoms  @xcite .",
    "this paper , however , concentrates on the formation of magnetic lenses for cold atoms . in comparison to a ballistically expanding unfocused cloud",
    ", a magnetically focused cloud can lead to density increases ( or conversely temperature decreases ) of many orders of magnitude .",
    "applications include : atom lithography  @xcite ; transferring cold atoms from a magneto optical trap ( mot ) to a remote vacuum chamber of lower background pressure  @xcite ; cold low - density atomic sources for fountain clocks @xcite .",
    "the first demonstration of 3d focusing with pulsed magnetic lenses was conducted by cornell  _ et al . _",
    "the group of gorceix have made experimental and theoretical studies of cold atom imaging by means of pulsed magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "however , neither work addressed the optimum strategy for achieving a compact focused cloud , nor the limiting features for the quality of their atom - optical elements .",
    "recently we provided a theoretical analysis of 3d focusing of weak - field - seeking cold atoms using a single magnetic pulse  @xcite .",
    "lens designs for 1d and 3d were presented that minimise aberrations due to the lens potential s departure from the perfect parabolic case .",
    "single - impulse 3d focusing has been experimentally achieved at durham university , the results of which can be seen in a forthcoming publication  @xcite .",
    "the scope of this paper is to investigate theoretically and numerically the limiting factors to the quality and size of the final image obtained in double - impulse magnetic focusing experiments ; to identify the sources of aberration ; and to discuss schemes for minimising their effect .",
    "we will show that both single- and double - impulse lenses yield a magnetically focused cloud with a bimodal distribution consisting of a highly diffuse outer cloud , as well as a core cloud which can be orders of magnitude denser than the initial atomic sample .",
    "this core cloud is therefore ideal for remotely loading tight traps with relatively small depth , e.g. miniature magnetic guides  @xcite , atom chips  @xcite and optical dipole traps @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : section 2 outlines the theory of how to achieve the desired magnetic fields ; section 3 contains an analysis of magnetic imaging and minimising the final cloud size ; section 4 describes and contrasts the spatial performance of different magnetic lenses ; section 5 considers experimentally relevant parameters for alternate gradient lenses ; section 6 contains a discussion and concluding remarks .",
    "an atom in a magnetic field of magnitude @xmath0 experiences a magnetic dipole interaction energy of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the projection of the atom s magnetic moment onto the field direction .",
    "provided that majorana spin - flip transitions @xcite occuring in field zeros are avoided and the rate of change of direction of the field is less than the larmor frequency the magnetic moment adiabatically follows the field .",
    "the stern - gerlach force is @xmath3 .",
    "the ensemble ( of alkali metal atoms ) can be optically pumped into either a strong - field - seeking state with @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the bohr magneton ) , or into a weak - field - seeking state with @xmath6 . in low field ,",
    "where the quantum numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 are good , these states are the stretched states @xmath9 .",
    "atoms in these states have a magnetic moment which is independent of field , consequently the stern - gerlach force takes the simpler form @xmath10  i.e. the focusing of the atoms is governed by the gradient of the magnetic field magnitude only .    the choice of whether atoms in weak or strong - field seeking states are launched depends on the particular application .",
    "we discussed extensively in  @xcite the focusing of atoms in weak - field - seeking states .",
    "this was because single - impulse 3d imaging of strong - field - seeking states requires a maximum of the magnetic field in free space , which is forbidden by earnshaw s theorem @xcite .",
    "in this paper magnetic lenses centred on the point @xmath11 are considered , with a second order magnetic field magnitude of the form : @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the bias field and the field curvature , respectively . substituting this into the stern - gerlach force expression results in an atom of mass @xmath15 experiencing a harmonic acceleration about @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a measure of the power of the lens .",
    "the axial curvature is twice the magnitude of , and opposite in sign to , the radial curvature , @xmath19 .",
    "note that lens curvature in all three spatial dimensions is reversed if the sign of either @xmath2 or @xmath20 is reversed .",
    "for simplicity from this point on , only the case @xmath21 i.e. weak - field - seeking atoms will be used and lens curvature is modified solely via @xmath20 .",
    "we refer to a lens with a field expansion of the form @xmath0 as a one - dimensional lens , as it can be used either to focus axially ( with simultaneous radial defocusing ) , when @xmath20 is positive , or to focus radially ( with simultaneous axial defocusing ) when @xmath20 is negative . in order to achieve a 3d focus with the lenses of equation  ( [ force1d ] )",
    ", an axially converging lens pulse must be followed by an appropriately timed axially diverging lens ( or vice versa ) .",
    "this is referred to as the  alternate gradient \" focusing method , and has the advantage of being able to focus both weak - field and strong - field seeking atoms .",
    "this method is used extensively in particle accelerators  @xcite , for focusing polar molecules  @xcite , and is shown schematically in figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "useful parameters for describing the evolution of a gaussian atomic cloud are the axial @xmath22 and radial @xmath23 rms cloud radii ( the standard deviations ) , as well as their aspect ratio @xmath24    =    as shown in reference  @xcite there exist optimal configurations for realising radial and axial focusing lenses . these are achieved with a pair of separated coaxial coils , where both coils have equal current with the same sense .",
    "an important lens parameter is the relative separation @xmath25 of the coils in units of the coil radius .",
    "the harmonicity of a radially - focusing lens is optimized if @xmath26 ( red lenses in figure  [ schematic ] ) ; whereas the harmonicity of an axially - focusing lens is optimized if @xmath27 ( blue lenses in figure  [ schematic ] ) . in the remainder of this work",
    "it is assumed that these optimized lenses are used .",
    "the separable equations of motion for an axially and cylindrically symmetric coil system lead to a lens that is harmonic in 3d with an acceleration given by equation ( [ force1d ] ) , which allows the motion in each cartesian dimension to be treated as a separate simple harmonic equation . the influence of a magnetic lens can be described by @xmath28 matrices , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "the initial and final position and velocity of an atom along a given cartesian axis , say @xmath29 , are related via the equation : @xmath30    a ` thick ' converging lens of strength @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 and physical duration @xmath33 is actually equivalent to the ` thin ' lens @xmath28 transformation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and is pre- and post - multiply by a translation matrix of half the effective pulse width @xmath36 the notation of primes is used to denote times in the ` thin ' lens representation . to model a diverging lens",
    "make the transformation @xmath37 in equation ( [ thincon ] ) ",
    "i.e.  @xmath38 and @xmath39 the ` equivalent time ' of the lens @xmath40 is not the same as the real experimental pulse duration of @xmath33 .",
    "a double lens system , see figure  [ timings ] , comprising lenses of strength and duration @xmath41 @xmath42 ( starting after a time @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 @xmath45 ( starting a time @xmath46 after the first lens ) is modelled by using the following @xmath28 matrix sequence : @xmath47 i.e. a @xmath48 translation , then a strength @xmath49 thin lens , a @xmath50 translation , then a strength @xmath51 thin lens followed by a @xmath52 translation , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55",
    ". the total physical duration of the focusing , @xmath56 is fixed , and the effective total time of the double lens system is @xmath57 .    =    by multiplying the matrices of equation ( [ doublelens ] ) together , the final @xmath28 system matrix is obtained . an image ( i.e. a one - to - one map of position between the initial and final cloud ) is formed if the condition @xmath58 is maintained . in this case",
    "the spatial magnification @xmath59 is the inverse of the velocity magnification @xmath60 ; a manifestation of liouville s theorem .",
    "the cloud extent along @xmath29 in a given plane is given by : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the initial position standard deviation and @xmath63 is the initial velocity standard deviation",
    "image _ is formed for the condition @xmath58 , but the _ smallest cloud size _ occurs when one minimises the product of the cloud extent for all 3 spatial dimensions ( i.e.  @xmath64 ) . for single- and double - impulse lens systems , the cloud size at the image plane and the minimum cloud size do not correspond exactly , but they are usually very similar . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will consider the cloud size at the image plane @xmath65 , and thus @xmath59 corresponds to the magnification .",
    "the important entries of the system matrix in equation ( [ doublelens ] ) are @xmath59 and @xmath66 : @xmath67 which are both second order in @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( and hence also second order in @xmath43 and @xmath70    to obtain an atom cloud which is focused in all 3 dimensions requires that the first lens is axially converging ( radially diverging ) and the second lens is axially diverging ( radially converging ) , or vice versa .",
    "moreover , the radial ( subscript @xmath71 ) and axial ( subscript @xmath72 ) spatial dimensions have different @xmath59 and @xmath66 coefficients .",
    "if the two axial lens strengths are @xmath73 and @xmath74 then equation ( [ force1d ] ) yields @xmath75 and @xmath76 a 3d image is formed when equation  ( [ ab ] ) is set equal to zero for both the radial and axial directions .    in reference",
    "@xcite the density increase from a single - impulse isotropic 3d harmonic lens , @xmath77 was characterised by @xmath78 the equivalent time of the thin lens , @xmath79 relative to the total equivalent focus time @xmath80 note that for the anisotropic lenses in this paper the _ equivalent _",
    "( i.e. thin lens ) timing of a lens in the radial and axial direction is different .",
    "for this reason we will characterise alternate - gradient lensing with the parameters @xmath81 corresponding to the mean times of the first and second magnetic impulses relative to the total experimental lensing time @xmath82 we use this labelling of @xmath83 if @xmath84 is real ( the first lens is radially converging ) , and we swap the definitions of @xmath85 and @xmath86 if @xmath84 is imaginary ( the first lens is radially diverging ) .    modelling an experiment being conducted at durham university @xcite , we fix @xmath87",
    ". the cold atom cloud has an isotropic initial spatial and velocity distribution with 1d standard deviations of @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( i.e. a temperature of  @xmath90 ) respectively .",
    "the coils are assumed to have a @xmath91 radius with 10,000 amp - turn current in each coil .",
    "the two lens combinations in figure  [ schematic ] are shown in the table below with the resulting angular frequencies .",
    ".the two different alternate - gradient strategies modelled .",
    "the @xmath31 s are the lens strengths , @xmath25 s are the coil separations and @xmath92 is the cloud aspect ratio . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that the monte carlo relative density increases in table  [ foctab ] are lower than those in figure  [ altgrad ] by a factor of @xmath93 , but the fraction of atoms in the focus are higher by a factor of @xmath93 .",
    "in figure  [ altgrad ] the density is estimated by measuring the fraction of atoms arriving at the harmonic focus . here , a 6-dimensional gaussian phase - space fit to the narrow central peak of the bimodal focus was made to explicitly obtain @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 the fraction of atoms in this gaussian focus was used for @xmath98 here .",
    "an interesting result of table [ foctab ] is that the aberrations of ` real ' lenses work to our advantage , to some extent , in that the atoms can be loaded into a trap with a shallower depth than atoms focused by a purely harmonic lens , and phase - space density loss is reduced during rethermalisation .",
    "this is due to the reduced anisotropy of the spatial and velocity distributions at the focus .",
    "the focused atoms have a relatively high temperature and one needs a trap depth of @xmath99mk to trap the focused atoms . for an atom with a magnetic moment of one bohr magneton @xmath100",
    "this corresponds to a magnetic trap depth @xmath101 g .",
    "the main application of interest for the magnetically imaged atoms will be loading a magnetic microtrap or optical dipole trap , for which alternate gradient imaging is well - suited .",
    "if the trap that is being loaded is harmonic , with a large capture volume , then the rms size of the cloud will be linked to the equilibrium temperature after elastic collisions rethermalise the initially bimodal image distribution . in order to keep the high density core of the atomic cloud",
    ", the high energy atoms must be removed on a time scale that is rapid compared to rethermalisation - this could be achieved with strong rf evaporative cooling or by shining resonant dark spot beams @xcite at the focal region .",
    "a trap with a small capture volume , e.g. an atom chip @xcite or a focused optical dipole beam trap @xcite , is ideal as only the high density core of atoms will be captured in the trap .",
    "the timescale needed to remove the shell of hot diffuse atoms from the central core will actually be much longer than the time it takes for the dense core atoms ( which are anisotropically focused in space and velocity ) to thermalise to a uniform temperature in 3d .",
    "the higher the anisotropy of the focused atomic cloud , the more phase space density is lost during the thermalisation .",
    "this loss could be mitigated to some extent if the radial and axial trap frequencies were varied to remain in equilibrium with the changing radial and axial cloud temperatures during the ( short ) thermalisation time .    in this paper",
    "we have used experimentally realistic parameters to compare the limiting focal size of a launched cold cloud of weak - field seeking atoms subject to either a single or double magnetic lens impulse .",
    "the @xmath28 matrix formalism was convenient for giving an estimate as to the parameters needed for magnetic focusing , but numerical simulations were necessary to detect the effects of aberrations in real magnetic lenses .",
    "if one wishes to minimise the rms image volume of a launched cloud then a single - impulse lens is preferable .",
    "if , however , one can selectively capture the central core of the bi - modal image , a double - impulse ( alternate gradient ) lens can lead to orders of magnitude relative density increases for both pancake- and sausage - shaped image clouds .",
    "although we have only considered cold thermal atomic clouds in this paper , the effects of aberrations will also be important for tight focusing of coherent matter waves @xcite .",
    "this work is supported by epsrc , the ukcan network and durham university .",
    "we thank charles adams , simon gardiner and kevin weatherill for fruitful discussions .",
    "this paper has only discussed parabolic lenses with constant strength @xmath102 pulsed on with a top - hat pulse of duration @xmath33 . in experiments",
    "the lens strength is a function of time , partly because the current in a real coil is not a top - hat pulse , and partly because the centre - of - mass of a launched atomic cloud changes as it goes through a lens and thus ( to second order in position ) will experience a time - varying parabolic lens . in practice",
    "it was unnecessary to adjust the timing or lens coil positions to allow for these effects in the simulations , however we briefly discuss ways around this issue should it become problematic .    a harmonic lens with arbitrary time variation @xmath103 ( where @xmath103 and its derivatives are zero outside the experimental pulse time @xmath104 ) , is equivalent to an infinite product of infinitesimal @xmath105 translation and thin lens matrices , resulting in a single @xmath105 matrix that is itself independent of the initial velocity and position of an atom .",
    "on solving @xmath106=-\\omega^2[t ] y[t]$ ] from @xmath107 to @xmath108 with the initial conditions @xmath109,y'[t_1]\\}=\\{dy,0\\}$ ] to get @xmath110,y'[t_1+\\tau_1]\\}=\\{\\mathcal{a},\\mathcal{c}\\ } dy$ ] , then use initial conditions @xmath109,y'[t_1]\\}=\\{0,dv\\}$ ] to get @xmath110,y'[t_1+\\tau_1]\\}=\\{\\mathcal{b},\\mathcal{d}\\ } dv$ ] , ( with small values for @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) results in the general @xmath113 matrix for any initial position and velocity from ( numerically or analytically ) solving the differential equation for only two different initial conditions .",
    "as this @xmath113 matrix has determinant 1 ( it is a product of determinant 1 matrices ) it can be expressed as a ( translation matrix)-(thin lens)-(translation matrix ) combination .",
    "one can then use an iterative 4d newton - raphson method with four input parameters ( the @xmath72 positions of the two alternate gradient lenses and the times @xmath43 and @xmath114 such that the @xmath72 centre - of - mass velocity of the atoms is not altered by either lens , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 are identical to zero .",
