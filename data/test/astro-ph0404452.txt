    "one of the most important developments in the field of interstellar gas dynamics during the last half - century was the renewed perception that most processes and structures are strongly affected by turbulence .",
    "this is a paradigm shift unparalleled in many other fields of astronomy , comparable perhaps to the discovery of extrasolar planets and cosmological structure at high redshift .",
    "interstellar turbulence and its implications were commonly discussed in the 1950s , but without the range of observations that are available today , the theory of the interstellar medium ( ism ) drifted toward increasingly detailed models based largely on a preference for thermal and dynamical equilibria .",
    "standing apart were two subfields that continued to include turbulence as the primary driver of all observations : radio scintillation and cosmic ray transport .",
    "the connections between these subfields and the prevailing picture of the ism were mostly ignored because of the large discrepancy in scales .",
    "consequently , two other small - scale processes got lost in the equilibrium paradigm of the large - scale models : mixing of the elements and molecular chemistry . in this review ,",
    "we discuss these four subfields in some detail .",
    "all have a well - established observational base going back several decades , but because of the complexity of turbulence and the infancy of the relevant theory , all of them are now in a state of rapid evolution .    our previous review _",
    "interstellar turbulence i _",
    "( this volume ) , emphasized observations in the dense neutral ism and discussed in detail the various theoretical approaches to this field .",
    "the degree to which turbulence and other transport processes mix or homogenize the gas in the face of repeated local pollutions by supernovae and other sources of fresh metals could provide an important constraint on the hydrodynamics of the ism .",
    "this general problem is called passive scalar turbulence because the particles being transported have no effect on the velocity field .",
    "a review of experiments involving incompressible turbulent scalar transport can be found in warhaft ( 2000 ) , who emphasized that passive scalar probability density functions ( pdfs ) usually have strong exponential tails .",
    "a review focussing on a particular class of theoretical approaches has been given by falkovich , gawedzki & vergassola ( 2001 ) , whereas reviews of methods to calculate the concentration pdf and its moments are in dopazo ( 1994 ) and obrien ( 1980 ) .",
    "briefer and more specialized treatments can be found in shraiman & siggia ( 2000 ) and pope ( 2000 , section 12.4 ) .    here",
    "we summarize observations of abundance variations in stars and gas , and we review recent theoretical work on interstellar turbulent mixing .",
    "we do not discuss star - to - star variations in globular clusters that may be affected by stellar evolution ( yong et al . 2003 ) .",
    "recent observations of metallicity dispersions in stars of the same age and in interstellar gas suggest that the ism is very well mixed on average , with typical fluctuations about the mean of only 520% .",
    "this low value is a challenge to explain considering the spotty pollution of new elements from supernovae and other sources .",
    "in addition , there are much larger observed fluctuations in a few places , suggesting the overall distribution function for abundance has a long , non - gaussian tail .",
    "both the low dispersion and the long tail might be explained by interstellar turbulence .",
    "stars of a similar age have often shown large variations in metallicity ( a term usually referring to iron abundance relative to the sun ) .",
    "for example , edvardsson et al . ( 1993 ) and chen et al . ( 2000 ) found factor - of - four abundance variations in several elements for f and g main sequence stars . after correcting for selection effects , edvardsson et al .",
    "estimated that the dispersion at a given age is about 0.15 to 0.20 dex , i.e. , 4060% , whereas garnett & kobulnicky ( 2000 ) suggested it is smaller than 0.15 dex for the same sample",
    ". a large unbiased sample of over 550 hipparcos stars with homogeneous chromospheric age estimates and photometric metallicities showed a dispersion at a given age of only 0.13 dex ( rocha - pinto et al .",
    "reddy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied 27 elements in 181 f and g stars and found a dispersion at a given age that is somewhat smaller than in edvardsson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and chen et al .",
    "feltzing & gonzales ( 2001 ) used an inhomogeneous sample of 5828 stars and found a larger scatter in the metallicity at a given age of 0.2 to 0.3 dex , which exceeds the observational errors .",
    "a major problem is that the ages of the stars used in these studies have large uncertainties .",
    "considering that the stellar orbits probably migrated and led to additional abundance variations from galactic radial gradients ( e.g. , wielen et al .",
    "1996 ) , the stellar results are consistent with a dispersion in the gas of 2030% or less , the upper limit set by uncertainties inherent in field star samples .",
    "other evidence for homogeneity among field stars comes from elemental abundance ratios .",
    "reddy et al . ( 2003 ) estimated the intrinsic scatter in the ratio [ x / fe ] for element x by fitting a gaussian curve to the histogram of deviations between [ x / fe ] and the linear fit of [ x / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "the standard deviations in the gaussian for 26 elements in 181 stars varied between 0.03 and 0.10 dex .",
    "these deviations are comparable to the errors , so the result is an upper limit to the intrinsic scatter .",
    "it does not depend on stellar age , as do the absolute abundances .",
    "reddy et al . noted that because the elements come in differing proportions from different sites of stellar nucleosynthesis , the lack of scatter implies all the ejecta were well - mixed in the gas before the stars formed .",
    "abundance fluctuations of 0.050.15 dex had also been found in studies of open clusters ( e.g. , friel & boesgaard 1992 , twarog et al . 1997 , carraro et al . 1998 ) , b stars in star - forming regions ( e.g. , cunha & lambert 1994 ) and clusters ( rolleston et al . 1994 ) , the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , olszewski et al .",

    "1998 ) , galactic _",
    "regions ( deharveng et al .",
    "2000 ) , and _ h ii _ regions in disk ( see review in henry & worthey 1999 ) and dwarf irregular ( e.g. , thuan et al .",
    "1995 ) galaxies",
    ".    however , f stars in nearby open clusters ( friel & boesgaard 1992 and references therein ) show no evidence for star - to - star abundance variations at the level of detectability .",
    "cluster - to - cluster variations are also small , including clusters of all ages , and essentially zero ( less than 1020% ) for the four clusters younger than @xmath0 years .",
    "the latter result implies that the ism is mixed , at least to this level , for scales between @xmath11 pc ( the size of the clumps from which clusters form ) and @xmath1100 pc ( the distances between clusters ) on a timescale less than @xmath0 years .",
    "even more stringent constraints were found from the photometric metallicity study of 76 clusters by twarog et al .",
    "comparison of high - precision photometry with stellar evolution models suggested a metallicity spread less than @xmath10.03 dex in the hyades cluster ( quillen 2002 ) .",
    "paulson , sneden & cochran ( 2003 ) derived the same small [ fe / h ] spread , excluding three outlier stars , using spectroscopic abundance determinations for individual stars .",
    "these results imply fluctuations of less than @xmath17% in the gas from which the hyades cluster formed .",
    "interstellar absorption studies suggest equally low dispersions .",
    "meyer et al . ( 1998 ) , moos et al.(2002 ) , and andre et al . ( 2003 ) found oxygen abundance dispersions over distances of around one kpc that are only a few percent .",
    "a recent study of interstellar kr / h by cartledge , meyer & lauroesch ( 2003 ) found a spread about the mean of only 0.06 dex for lines of sight within the local orion spur ; this was less than the measurement error .",
    "we conclude that the most recent evidence , based on field stars of a given age , cluster stars , and the ism , suggests a metallicity dispersion that is very small , less than 20 to 30% and perhaps as small as a few percent .",
    "this small galactic dispersion is consistent with the study of 41 _ h ii _ regions in m101 by kennicutt & garnett ( 1996 ) .",
    "there are notable exceptions , though , including : ( _ a _ ) the existence of old super - metal - rich stars ( e.g. , feltzing & gonzalez 2001 ) , and a large range in abundance ratios among metal - poor stars ( fields et al .",
    "2002 ) ; ( _ b _ ) the lack of an age - metallicity relation for five nearby clusters , which led boesgaard ( 1989 ) to conclude that local abundance fluctuations of @xmath10.20.3 dex must persist for at least @xmath2@xmath3 years ( but see friel & boesgaard 1992 for a revised result ) ; ( _ c _ ) the factor of 2 to 3 fluctuations in [ o / h ] among subgroups in orion ( cunha & lambert 1994 ) , which , however , may be a result of self - pollution ; ( _ d _ ) the study of b stars in several clusters at galactocentric distance @xmath113 kpc that indicates one cluster has [ fe / h ] larger than the rest by a factor of @xmath15 ( rolleston , dufton & fitzsimmons 1994 ) , ( _ e _ ) two stars in the carina nebula ( andre et al .",
    "2003 ) that are separated by only a few hundred parsecs but have line - of - sight oxygen abundances different by about 40% , and ( _ f _ ) outlier stars in the cluster studies discussed earlier .",
    "these examples suggest a metallicity pdf with a small variance and possibly large higher moments , i.e. , a fat tail at large metallicities .",
    "such a pdf is similar to that found for the pdf of passive scalars in incompressible turbulence ( warhaft 2000 ) .",
    "the analogous pdf for a compressible , magnetic , and self - gravitating ism is unknown .",
    "theoretical investigations of abundance fluctuations have until recently nearly all been based on order of magnitude arguments involving characteristic spatial scales and timescales for various processes .",
    "two of the more thorough discussions are in roy & kunth ( 1995 ) and tenorio - tagle ( 1996 ) .",
    "regarding spatial scales , elmegreen ( 1998 ) pointed out that for a hierarchically structured ism with star formation operating on a local dynamical time , the size of an o and b star association is usually larger than the supernovae remnants it produces .",
    "unless there is some immediate mixing , as in hot ionized or evaporating flows , the new elements should be spotty and variable for subsequent generations of stars ( self - enrichment ) .",
    "the point about timescales was highlighted by reeves ( 1972 ) : the mean time for a gas element to get reincorporated into a star is shorter than the time for its dispersal by supernova mixing , so abundance fluctuations should be large .",
    "both results contradict the apparent uniformity of abundances inside and between clusters and in the general ism .",
    "estimates for mixing times have changed since reeves ( 1972 ) paper .",
    "edmunds ( 1975 ) found that the timescale for mixing of gas by turbulence and galactic shear is relatively short compared with the star formation time , provided the sources of metals do not cluster together making the dispersion more difficult ( kaufman 1975 ) .",
    "bateman & larson ( 1993 ) also derived a short mixing time , considering diffusion by cloud motions , as did roy & kunth ( 1995 ) , who applied the diffusion approximation to galactic shear , radial flows , turbulent diffusion , supernovae , and gas instabilities .",
    "similarly short timescales can be derived using structure functions by considering the separation of initially nearby lagrangian fluid particles ( frisch 1995 ) .",
    "this latter procedure is often used to derive the richardson 4/3 law of superdiffusive incompressible turbulence .",
    "the implication of these short mixing times is that the ism should be homogeneous .",
    "the expectation of large spatial fluctuations may be viewed in a different way too , by considering the number of overlapping regions of contamination .",
    "edmunds ( 1975 ) showed that @xmath4 supernovae in a local volume should lead to inhomogeneities of order @xmath5 if there is no subsequent mixing .",
    "adopting an average of @xmath6 , he suggested that fluctuations would be relatively small .",
    "more detailed models for overlapping contaminations were studied by roy & kunth ( 1995 ) , argast et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and oey ( 2000 ) .",
    "oey ( 2003 ) used turbulent dispersal from bateman & larson ( 1993 ) to enlarge the effective sizes and reduce the average metallicities in the overlapping regions .",
    "low metallicity stars and galaxies should have large metallicity dispersions because the numbers of contaminating events are small ( audouze & silk 1995 ) .",
    "a problem with most of the timescale arguments is that they apply to turbulent transport and not homogenization .",
    "moving clouds around or shredding them with fluid instabilities does not homogenize the gas at the atomic level or change the frequency distribution of abundance concentrations ; viscosity and molecular diffusion are required for that .",
    "the same is true for incompressible turbulence imagined as a cascade of vortices .",
    "unless the advection process creates steep gradients on small scales , molecular diffusion can not occur in a reasonable time .",
    "the situation changes when there are large - scale gradients in the mean concentration ; then advection from distant regions can change the concentration distribution locally ( see equation  [ eq : zave ] below ) .",
    "even so , homogenization requires molecular diffusion .",
    "thus , a small transport time in the ism does not imply the gas will homogenize enough to remove abundance differences before it forms stars and clusters .",
    "the size and placement of each protostellar core within the complex spatial pattern of abundance fluctuations will determine its metallicity .",
    "releasing metals into the interstellar turbulent gas is similar in basic respects to dropping a blob of ink into a turbulent fluid .",
    "figure [ fig : mix ] shows such a release into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) incompressible forced chaotic velocity field ( jullien et al .",
    "advection spreads the scalar out in space , while concentrating it locally through stretching and folding , shearing it into thin ribbons until the spatial gradients are large enough that molecular diffusion becomes significant in the third frame . by the final frame , diffusion has smeared out most of the striated structures .",
    "how does turbulence deliver gradients to small enough scales for molecular diffusion to cause homogenization in a reasonable time ?",
    "de avillez & mac low ( 2002 ) found a surprisingly long timescale for the decay of the variance in a passive scalar field that had an initial checkerboard pattern and was mixed by supernovae .",
    "their time scaled to a galaxy ( at least a few times @xmath2 years ) is larger than previous estimates and still is a lower limit because they did not include sources of new metals .",
    "de avillez & mac low also found that the mixing time is independent of the mixing length , unlike mixing modeled as diffusion , and that the mixing time decreases with increasing supernova rate as a result of the increased velocities",
    ".    there may be ways other than turbulence to get gradients on small enough scales for molecular diffusion to homogenize . in tenorio - tagle s ( 1996 )",
    "`` fountain with a spray '' model , metal - rich droplets falling onto the disk are subject to rayleigh - taylor instabilities that reduce their size even further ; diffusion will be very effective in such a situation .",
    "there are many methods for studying passive scalar turbulent transport . here",
    "we describe two approaches : prescribed artificial velocity fields and closure methods for studying restricted properties of turbulent transport .",
    "most of what is known about passive scalar turbulence comes from models using an idealized velocity field that is not a rigorous solution to the hydrodynamics equations ( see review by falkovich et al .",
    "an example would be a time - uncorrelated velocity field with gaussian statistics , a prescribed spatial correlation function , and a constraint of incompressibility .",
    "this is called a kraichnan velocity field ( e.g. , shraiman & siggia 2000 ) .",
    "the advantages of such a field are that the equations for the concentration field and its statistical properties can in some cases be solved analytically without a closure assumption , and the generic properties of the result might be valid for any velocity field that has the same variance and conservation constraints . however , there is a large danger in assuming a delta function for the time correlation function .",
    "large intermittency in the velocity gradient field means that a large fraction of the fluid contains large gradients compared with a gaussian . in incompressible turbulence",
    "( and the ism  see _ interstellar turbulence i _ ) , this fraction gets larger on smaller scales .",
    "this implies that intermittency should homogenize the gas faster than purely gaussian motions , because molecular diffusion depends on large velocity gradients at small scales .",
    "decamp & le bourlot ( 2002 ) used another model velocity field that was obtained from a wavelet reconstruction with statistical properties similar to the ism velocity field , including motions correlated in space and time .",
    "they solved the continuity equations and showed that the correlated velocity field has a faster dispersion and a larger standard deviation for passive scalars ( by factors of 2 to 4 ) than an uncorrelated gaussian velocity field .",
    "the spatial distributions for species undergoing chemical reactions were also different , suggesting a mechanism for molecular segregation in dense clouds ( section [ sect : chem ] ) .",
    "further work on turbulent mixing using synthetic velocity fields is in elliott & majda ( 1996 ) , fung & vassilicos ( 1998 ) , and boffetta et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .      for some purposes",
    ", it may be sufficient to understand how the mean , variance , and skewness of a metallicity distribution depend on the source terms and large - scale gradients .",
    "this is the moment approach , and it has the advantage that some of its results can be obtained analytically . the moment approach might explain , for example , why there is an inverse square root scaling on the supernova rate for the decay timescale of the abundance variance ( de avillez & mac low 2002 ) .",
    "the evolution equation for the one - point probability distribution of metallicities was derived rigorously for incompressible turbulence by dopazo , valino & fueyo ( 1997 ) , who also derived the moment equations for incompressible flow ( see also obrien 1980 ; chen & kollman 1994 ; dopazo 1994 ; pope 1994 , 2000 ) .",
    "perhaps the simplest question that can be asked about scalar turbulence concerns the way in which the average relative concentration @xmath7 of a local patch of contaminant ( relative to hydrogen , for example ) will spread in space as a function of time .",
    "the usual place to start is to examine the mean square distance , @xmath8 , traveled by a marked lagrangian fluid particle .",
    "this distance can be related to an integral over the lagrangian correlation function , assuming only statistically stationary and isotropic turbulence . without knowing the correlation function , however , this relation is of little use .",
    "an approximation is to use the fact that the correlation is unity at time zero and approaches zero for large separations .",
    "then for times much smaller than the correlation time @xmath9 , @xmath10 whereas at @xmath11 , @xmath12 . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the two - time correlation function at a given point in the flow for lag @xmath14 ; i.e. , @xmath15 for flow speed @xmath16 and the average @xmath17 is over all pairs of points separated by @xmath14 .",
    "normalization to the variance , @xmath18 , makes @xmath13 dimensionless with values between @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in this formulation",
    ", the particle behaves ballistically at short times and has an uncorrelated random walk at large times .",
    "these results are usually referred to as taylor s theorem ( taylor 1921 ; see mccomb 1990 ; pope 2000 ) .",
    "the result is important for illustrating the nature of turbulence as a correlated random walk and the analogy between turbulent and molecular diffusion , where in the latter case @xmath21 would be the mean collision time .",
    "klessen & lin ( 2003 ) recently showed that taylor s theorem is correct in 3d - compressible turbulence .",
    "mccomb ( 1990 ) , piterbarg & ostrovskii ( 1997 ) and others have pointed out that taylor s theorem does not solve the problem of turbulent dispersal and transport , even for the mean field because what is required is information in the lab frame , not following the particle .",
    "klessen & lin ( 2003 ) suggest that the result can be used to develop a phenomenological mixing - length or diffusion model for turbulent transport in the ism in which the integral correlation time is related to the mean time between shock passages .",
    "another fundamental relationship is richardson s law ( richardson 1926 ) for the rate at which pairs of points separate in space in the inertial range of turbulence .",
    "one form of this law states that the time dependence of the rms separation is @xmath22 ( falkovich et al .",
    "2001 , boffetta & sokolov 2002 , nicolleau & vassilicos 2003 ) .",
    "work on pair dispersion using synthetic velocity fields has resulted in at least two important insights : ( _ a _ ) the dynamics of particle pairs is sensitive to initial conditions but their rms separation increases algebraically , not exponentially ( unlike low - dimensional chaotic systems ) .",
    "( _ b _ ) particle pairs travel together for long times and then separate explosively when they encounter straining regions around hyperbolic points in the flow ( e.g. , nicolleau & vassilicos 2003 ) .    a traditional approach that could be applied to the spreading of newly produced elements from sources in the ism",
    "is to ignore the detailed dynamics and use an equation for the evolution of the mean concentration field alone . in general",
    ", the concentration @xmath23 of an element evolves in a given velocity field @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass diffusivity and @xmath27 is the rate at which sources inject the element . the second term on the left represents the effect of the turbulent velocity field in advecting the concentration field .",
    "for the interstellar medium this velocity field will consist of complex compressions and vortical motions .",
    "the first term on the right represents molecular diffusion , which operates only on small scales in regions where the gradient of the concentration field is large .",
    "this equation illustrates how turbulent advection of a passive scalar spreads it out in space while increasing the local gradients through stretching , compressing , and folding .",
    "molecular diffusion then operates where the gradients are high .",
    "timescales for molecular diffusion have been discussed recently by oey ( 2003 ) for a uniform gas .",
    "the result is sensitive to temperature , so most of the homogenization of elements in the ism may occur in the hot regions , like superbubbles ( silich et al .",
    "2001 ) , as well as those with the steepest velocity gradients .    to obtain the time evolution of the average concentration",
    ", one might choose to ignore all the details of the turbulence and spatially average equation [ eq : z ] .",
    "ignoring also the molecular diffusion and source terms , we get @xmath28 for mean concentration and velocity @xmath7 and @xmath29 and fluctuating parts @xmath30 and @xmath24 .",
    "the last term is zero for incompressible turbulence , leaving only @xmath31 , which contains the unknown ensemble average of the scalar flux , @xmath32 , representing interactions between the fluctuating parts of the velocity and concentration fields .",
    "this is a classic closure problem .",
    "we could derive a differential equation for the scalar flux , but it would contain more unknown correlations , including triple correlations , and further manipulation only leads to higher and higher order unknowns .    in the incompressible case ,",
    "the simplest treatment is to imagine that the turbulent transport behaves diffusively , like molecules in a gas .",
    "then the scalar flux is proportional to the mean concentration gradient and given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a scalar diffusivity given by some timescale times the square of some velocity .",
    "often these are taken to be the correlation time and the rms velocity , although a variety of other forms have been used to fit specific experimental results ( piterbarg & ostrovskii 1997 ) . using equation  [ eq : flux ] , equation",
    "[ eq : zave ] becomes the usual diffusion equation , and the patch of concentration , if initially a point source , would spread according to a gaussian whose width grows @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , turbulent transport can not be described by classical diffusion because triple correlations are as important as quadratic correlations , or , more physically , turbulent motions are not random independent steps but correlated bulk transports over a wide range of scales .",
    "there have been many attempts , all unsuccessful to various degrees , to develop closure techniques for passive scalar turbulence .",
    "many of these are described in reviews by obrien ( 1980 ) and dopazo ( 1994 ) .",
    "perhaps the most popular in the physics community is the mapping closure suggested by chen , chen & kraichnan ( 1989 ) .",
    "a more complicated closure method is based on the eddy - damped quasinormal markovian approximation ( lesieur 1990 ) .",
    "an application of this closure to the passive scalar problem with reference to earlier work is in herr , wang & collins ( 1996 ) .",
    "a promising approach that is not too complex yet captures the importance of the triple correlations was proposed by blackman & field ( 2002 ) in connection with turbulent dynamo theory and then applied to the scalar turbulence problem ( blackman & field 2003 ) .",
    "the idea is to model the time derivative of the scalar flux as a normal diffusion term with an eddy viscosity plus a damping term @xmath36 , where @xmath14 is a relaxation time .",
    "this approach is similar to a closure method used in terrestrial atmospheric turbulent transport ( lewellen 1977 ) . when this is substituted in the equation for @xmath7 , a little manipulation results in a damped wave equation for the mean concentration .",
    "brandenburg , kapyla & mohammed ( 2004 ) did extensive comparisons with numerical simulations of passive scalars in mildly compressible turbulence ( rms mach number @xmath10.2 ) and found good agreement with this model for the time evolution of the spreading size and the non - gaussianity ( kurtosis ) of @xmath7 .",
    "the moment approach can derive the variance of the abundance distribution directly from equation  [ eq : z ] by writing the velocity , abundance , and source fields as the sum of mean and fluctuating parts ( e.g. , @xmath37 ) , multiplying the resulting equation for @xmath38 by @xmath30 , and then ensemble averaging to obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fluctuating part of the source term ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the first term on the right shows how the scalar flux ( @xmath42 ) interacts with any large - scale gradient in the abundance , increasing variance if @xmath42 is proportional to a mean gradient ( as in equation  [ eq : flux ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to how stellar orbit diffusion in the presence of a radial gradient produces fluctuations in the stellar abundances .",
    "the second term indicates that any gradient in the mean square fluctuations will be advected with the mean flow ( e.g. , radial flows or infall ) .    the third term in equation  [ eq : z2 ] shows how turbulence can affect a concentration variance even with no gradient in @xmath7 , zero mean velocity , and without diffusion .",
    "writing this term as @xmath43 shows that it consists of the mean divergence of the flux of scalar variance , as might be expected , minus a term that is only nonzero in the presence of compressibility .",
    "differentiation and ensemble averaging commute , so the first term of these two is zero for a homogeneous fluid because ensemble averages do not depend on spatial position .",
    "the fourth term represents the net production of scalar variance by the fluctuating nucleosynthetic sources .",
    "`` diffusion '' in this context is shorthand for the fairly complex set of second - order derivatives involving mass diffusion at the molecular level .    as a simple illustration ,",
    "assume there are no large scale flows and the abundance is linear in galactocentric distance with constant of proportionality @xmath44 .",
    "for a general gradient term , we would have the triple correlation whose closure is discussed by blackman & field ( 2003 ) and brandenburg , kapyla & mohammed ( 2004 ) .",
    "then we can also derive an equation for the correlation @xmath42 by multiplying equation  [ eq : z ] by @xmath24 and ensemble averaging .",
    "the result is , for @xmath45 , @xmath46 the first term on the right , which is @xmath47 for an isotropic velocity field , represents the production of correlations by interaction of the velocity fluctuations with the mean metallicity gradient .",
    "we can assume that we are given some steady - state isotropic turbulent velocity field so that @xmath48 is constant .",
    "the second term on the right , often called pressure scrambling , is a serious closure problem for compressible turbulence .",
    "the source term is important if the metals come from young stars whose formation is associated with the turbulence itself , but for type i supernovae or any other source that has time to decorrelate from the flow , @xmath49 .",
    "this indicates the importance of using a consistent model for the formation of metal - producers from the turbulent field .",
    "equations [ eq : z2 ] and [ eq : zu ] can now be solved to give the evolution of the standard deviation of the abundance distribution for a particular velocity and source field .",
    "if we neglect pressure scrambling in equation  [ eq : zu ] and the compressibility term in equation  [ eq : z2 ] , and also replace the triple correlation term with a simple gradient - diffusion closure , then the result would show that the concentration fluctuation variance increases @xmath50 , even in the absence of sources .",
    "the turbulence is transporting high - z gas into low - z gas ( and vice versa ) due to the existence of the gradient . obviously ,",
    "after some time the large fluctuations imply steep gradients at very small scales , and so the microscopic diffusion term will cause the variance to level off .",
    "in addition , the gradient itself will be washed out by the turbulence unless there is some mechanism continually producing it . without a sustained mean gradient ,",
    "such equations could be used to understand how the variance in elemental fluctuations should decrease with time under the action of only advection and diffusion , giving a simplified model to understand the numerical decay results of de avillez & mac low ( 2002 ) . with some assumed closure for the source terms , or with prescribed velocity field statistics",
    ", the solution of equation  [ eq : z2 ] would show how the abundance variance depends on the source rate .",

    "begelman & fabian ( 1990 ) and slavin , shull & begelman ( 1993 ) proposed that such turbulent layers could mix hot and warm gas , but they could just as well mix freshly - produced metals .",
    "tenorio - tagle ( 1996 ) suggested that superbubbles blow out of the disk and rain down metal rich droplets that break apart by rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "this process could disperse metals over several kpc in the disk with no assistance from disk turbulence .",
    "these processes are also relevant for the redistribution of elements ejected by galactic blowout into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . several papers ( e.g. , ferrara et al . 2000 , aguirre et al",

    "early estimates for the efficiency of this process were given by cameron ( 1973 ) , burke & silk ( 1976 ) , scalo ( 1977 ) , and draine ( 1985 ) , but the conception of how grain advection occurs differs greatly in these papers .",

    "more recent theoretical investigations ( e.g. , sigurgeirsson & stuart 2002 , lopez & puglisi 2003 ) have demonstrated several interesting properties of this clustering .",
    "all of this work relies on synthetic velocity fields because inertial particle advection in real turbulent flows would require resolution much finer than the dissipation scale .",
    "nevertheless , the essential physics of particle drag is becoming more clear .",
    "the particle motion is dissipative even if the advecting flow is incompressible , and hence , dissipationless ( balkovsky , falkovich & fouxon 2001 ) .",
    "this leads to simplified treatments in which the stokes drag effect is modeled as a small compressible component to the velocity field of the inertial particles .",
    "a detailed study of inertial particle dynamics in incompressible flows ( bec et al . 2003 ) shows that particles smaller than a critical size form fractal clusters whereas larger sizes fill space with a nonuniform density .",
    "an extension to highly compressible flows is desirable .    the motion of charged dust grains in anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence was considered by yan & lazarian ( 2002 ) , who made a distinction between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the field .",
    "grains with a gyration time around the field that is shorter than the gas drag time will follow the turbulent field fluctuations in the perpendicular direction .",
    "yan & lazarian ( 2003b ) calculated the acceleration of charged grains that resonate with mhd fluctuations .",
    "another reason to study stirring by interstellar turbulence is to understand the origin of galactic radial abundance gradients ( carraro et al .",
    "1998 , hou et al .",
    "2000 , rolleston et al .",
    "2000 ) . models typically account for these gradients using a radially dependent timescale for infall and star formation ( e.g. , chiappini et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a problem is that turbulence should reduce large - scale gradients , so studies of this turbulent washout could give an estimate of the timescale on which the gradient must be replenished .",
    "order of magnitude estimates along the lines of those mentioned in section [ sect : howlarge ] indicate replenishment timescales larger than characteristic infall times , suggesting that contributions from a radially dependent stellar initial mass function ( imf ) or other effects are not required .    a peculiar abundance gradient has been observed in the outer galaxy , where clusters ( twarog et al . 1997 ) and cepheids ( caputo et al . 2001 , andrievsky et al . 2002 , luck et al . 2003 ) suggest a sudden decrease in metal abundance by about 0.2 dex setting in at 10 kpc .",
    "this discontinuity appears over a radial distance less than 1 kpc .",
    "it is hard to see how such a feature could survive turbulent washout for more than @xmath2 years using timescale arguments of the type summarized earlier .",

    "the coupling of interstellar chemistry to the dynamics of interstellar gas has focused for a long time on collapsing or slowly contracting clouds ( e.g. , gerola & glassgold 1978 ; prasad , heere & tarafdar 1991 ; shematovich et al .",
    "2003 ) and single shocks or mhd waves ( e.g. , hollenbach & mckee 1979 , 1989 ; draine & katz 1986 ; charnley 1998 ; flower & pineau des forts 1998 ) .",

    "1991 ; nejad & wagenblast 1999 ; but see turner et al .",
    "the result that nondynamical time - dependent abundances agreed with observations for different ages is a strong motivation for the influence of turbulence because turbulent timescales are often smaller than the chemical equilibrium times .",
    "turbulent transport can prevent the chemistry from attaining a steady state ( e.g. , phillips & huggins 1981 ; xie , allen & langer 1995 ; willacy , langer & allen 2002 ) .",
    "turbulence can affect ism chemistry in three ways : ( _ a _ ) by continually transporting material between regions with different physical conditions , like ambient ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation flux , temperature , and density , ( _ b _ ) by creating localized heating where temperature - sensitive reactions , especially those involving endothermic reactions , will be enhanced , and ( _ c _ ) by magnetically forcing ions to move faster than the thermal speed where they can enhance the temperature - sensitive ion - neutral reactions .",
    "progress in this field is difficult because of limitations in the dynamical models and because of the large number of nondynamical chemical effects that may occur , like neutral - neutral reactions at low temperature , variable c and o depletion , three - body channels for dissociative recombination , the presence of cosmic - ray - induced uv photons , chemical phase transitions , and many more , as reviewed by herbst ( 1999 ) , hollenbach & tielens ( 1999 ) , van dishoeck & hogerheijde ( 1999 ) , and langer et al .",

    "boland & dejong ( 1982 ) proposed that turbulent circulation could explain this discrepancy by bringing grains to the outer layers for uv desorption .",
    "modern observations ( kramer et al . 1999 ) show more depletion , however , and photodissociation region ( pdr ) models suggest carbon comes from clump surfaces at a range of depths ( howe et al .",

    "pijpers ( 1997 ) considered a diffusive model of turbulent grain transport and obtained a long migration time .",
    "ragot ( 1998 ) pointed out that turbulent transport is probably neither ballistic nor diffusive , and used a model based on levy flights to return to the smaller timescales .",
    "this transport effect is important because the degree to which co is released from grains into the gas can affect the rest of the chemistry ( co deactivates much chemistry by depleting the h@xmath51 ion ; nejad & wagenblast 1999 ) .",
    "a detailed study of turbulent transport including 87 species and 1100 reactions was given by xie et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who assumed that radial flux is proportional to the spatial gradient of a species and used a mixing length model for turbulent diffusion .",
    "they found that most carbon - bearing species and several other important molecules were strongly affected by turbulence .",
    "the model was extended recently by willacy , langer & allen ( 2002 ) , who showed how the _",
    "h i_/h@xmath52 ratio could provide a sensitive signature of turbulent transport .",
    "this occurs because h@xmath52 forms when h reacts on dust grains .",
    "the formation rate depends on the density of atomic h and the total dust cross section , whereas the destruction rate depends on the uv field .",
    "if turbulence cycles material between regions with different uv optical depths on a timescale comparable to the formation time , then h will penetrate deeper into the cloud and h@xmath52 will be closer to the surface .",
    "because many other simple molecules are formed from h@xmath52-based intermediaries ( especially h@xmath51 ) , turbulent transport could control the chemistry for many species .",
    "timescales for reaching chemical equilibrium depend on density , temperature , and ionization fraction , and are typically @xmath53@xmath54 years ( van dishoeck & hogerheijde 1999 ) . for the atomic part of a photodissociation region , the longest part of the cycle c@xmath55 ch@xmath56 co@xmath57 c @xmath58c@xmath59 is the formation time of ch@xmath60 through radiative association ( tielens & hollenbach 1985 ) with a timescale @xmath110@xmath61 years for @xmath62 particle density in units of @xmath63 @xmath64 . for turbulent transport ,",

    "the chemical and transport timescales are comparable at @xmath63 @xmath64 , but the transport time becomes larger than the chemical time at higher density and then turbulence would seem to have little effect . because cosmic ray ionization drives the chemistry , and each ionized h@xmath52 molecule eventually forms co or some other important molecule ,",
    "the chemical timescale in the cores of dense clouds is the ratio of the relative abundance of co , @xmath110@xmath69 , to the cosmic ray ionization rate , @xmath14@xmath70 s@xmath71 ; this gives @xmath110@xmath72 years ( d.j .",
    "hollenbach , private communication ) .",
    "another way in which turbulence may affect chemistry is through localized heating in shocks ( flower & pineau des for@xmath73ts 1998 ) , vortices ( joulain et al . 1998 ) , ambipolar diffusion ( padoan , zweibel & nordlund 2000 ) , and magnetic reconnection ( lazarian & vishniac 1999 ) .",
    "there are many reactions that seem to require higher than normal temperatures .    for diffuse clouds ,",
    "the large abundance of ch@xmath59 and molecules like hco@xmath59 that can form from ch@xmath59 , and the large abundance of oh ( gredel 1997 , lucas & liszt 1997 ) , all suggest that high temperature ( @xmath110@xmath74 k ) reactions take place , as in shock fronts ( elitzur & watson 1980 , draine & katz 1986 )",
    ". however , the correlation between ch@xmath59 and the lower - temperature molecule c@xmath52 ( gredel 1999 ) , and the similar radial velocities of ch@xmath59 and ch rule out ch@xmath59 production in single large shocks or cloud surfaces .",
    "instead , ch@xmath59 could be made in numerous unresolved shocks that blend on a line of sight with cooler gas at the same average velocity ( gredel , pineau des for@xmath75ts & federman 2002 ) .",
    "part of the appeal of turbulence is its great range of scales that can yield such an effect .",
    "temperature fluctuations of several hundred degrees could play a major role in the chemistry of many species because of the inverse temperature dependence of radiative association and the range of activation energies for collisional dissociation , neutral - neutral reactions , and some ion - molecule reactions .",
    "neutral - neutral reactions may be important even in dark clouds ( bettens et al .",
    "prasad & huntress ( 1980 ) long ago pointed out the importance of temperature variations in radiative association reactions and some ion - molecule reactions . also , in dense shielded clouds , warm regions drive most of the o , oh , and o@xmath52 to h@xmath52o through reactions like o + h@xmath76 oh@xmath77h and oh+h@xmath76h@xmath52o+h ( e.g. , charnley 1998 ) , not only enhancing the h@xmath52o abundance , but also preventing the formation of molecules like so@xmath52 , which rely on the oxygen species for their formation . the cn abundance should be enhanced because its destruction by reaction with o and o@xmath52 is suppressed ; this can lead to enhanced production of hc@xmath78n through reaction of cn with c@xmath52h@xmath52",
    ".    there have been several attempts to model the effects of local turbulent heating on chemistry .",
    "black & van dishoeck ( 1991 ) pointed out that if turbulence extends down to the collisional mean free path , then the tail of the particle velocity distribution could be enhanced .",
    "reaction rates are averages over the particle relative velocity distribution , so energy - dependent cross - sections could have greatly enhanced rates . spaans ( 1996 ) noted that the distribution of velocity differences in turbulent flows at small scales has a large tail and suggested this could result in non - maxwellian relative speeds between molecules , especially those involved with ch@xmath59 production .",
    "this assumption is questionable because the reaction scales are the mean free paths , of order 1au@xmath79 , and these are smaller than the viscous dissipation scale of incompressible turbulence .",
    "the validity of the fluid approximation for neutrals is also questionable at these scales ( see _ interstellar turbulence i _ ) , although mhd turbulence in the ionic component could enhance the ion - neutral collision rate .",
    "another approach to the problem was presented in a series of papers by falgarone and coworkers .",

    "species that do not normally peak at the same time for a nonturbulent model can coexist in a turbulent model , which means that the age of a region can not be inferred from the abundances .",
    "the issue of chemical differentiation is important because it is well - established and unexplained in a number of starless cores such as tmc-1 , l134n , and l1544 , and observed as 110 au variations in co , h@xmath52co , and oh relative to h@xmath52 toward extragalactic background sources ( marscher , moore & bania 1993 ; moore & marscher 1995 ; for more recent work , see pan , federman & welty 2001 ; rollinde et al . 2003 ; stanimirovic et al .",
    "although some of these variations may be attributed to freeze - out of molecules on dust grains ( bergin et al .",

    ". the observed variations at scales so small that gravity is unimportant seem to favor turbulence .",
    "the calculations by decamp & lebourlet also develop a bistable chemical pattern in which dual equilibria are possible .",
    "however , it is not known how many of the effects result from the imposed artificial velocity field , which is not able to react to the changing density field through pressure .",
    "the only truly hydrodynamical turbulence simulation that included a small but relevant chemical reaction subset was by pavlovski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who generalized previous work by mac low and coworkers to include a large number of coolants and a wide range of possible temperatures and densities .",
    "the reaction network in pavlovski et al . included h , c , o , and five molecules formed from them , and it included h@xmath52 formation on grains .",
    "they followed the decay of hypersonic turbulence without self - gravity in a dense ( @xmath81 @xmath64 ) , small ( @xmath82 cm ) region . their surprising result was that after h@xmath52 dissociated in a shock , the molecules reformed in a pattern of filaments , clumps , and diffuse gas yet the abundances were fairly uniform after only 100 years .",
    "there are probably other processes that produce localized regions of hot chemistry .",
    "for example , ambipolar diffusion heating depends on a high - order derivative of the magnetic field and so can produce heating rates that exceed the average rate by orders of magnitude on very small scales ( padoan , zweibel , & nordlund 2000 ) . magnetic reconnection ( lazarian & vishniac 1999 ) is another possibility for localized hot gas .",

    "the field line fluctuations that scatter cosmic rays could be coherent waves , stochastic turbulence , or shock fronts .",
    "one common view of waves is that they are weak fluctuations compared with the mean field , with wave travel times much longer than an oscillation period and a well - defined dispersion relation between frequency and wavenumber .",
    "particles in such a wave field interact successively with many crests , travelling rapidly along the field until their cumulative pitch angle deviation becomes large and they begin to interact with a different wave train .",
    "a turbulent medium is not so regular but particle interactions with a broad wave spectrum can be similar as long as the particle sees a magnetic perturbation with the right wavelength after each gyration . in both cases the field can be treated as static for the fast - moving particles .",
    "much of the history of cosmic ray theory is based on observations of the solar wind , which contains a mixture of weak and strong fluctuations , depending on frequency ( drge 1994 ; goldstein , roberts & matthaeus 1995 ) .",
    "perhaps @xmath115% of it is in the form of slab - like alfvn waves ( @xmath131 ) and @xmath185% is two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetic turbulence ( @xmath132 , bieber , wanner & matthaeus 1996 ) . here",
    ", @xmath133 and @xmath134 are wavenumbers perpendicular and parallel to the mean field .",
    "the solar wind observations led to the quasilinear theory of cosmic ray propagation ( jokipii 1966 ) , which assumes the field is uniform in space and unchanging in time over a particle gyration .",
    "interstellar applications of this theory may be appropriate at high spatial frequencies where weak electron perturbations scatter radio waves ( section [ sect : scint ] ) , or near shock fronts where weak waves on either side scatter relativistic particles back and forth ( section [ sect : cracc ] ) , or for waves that are excited by the cosmic rays themselves ( chandran 2000a ) .",
    "the waves cause cosmic rays to diffuse in both momentum and space ( e.g. , schlickeiser 1994 ) .",
    "momentum diffusion means that velocities change and isotropize ; space diffusion means that cosmic rays spread out slowly to more uniform densities .",
    "the two diffusion coefficients are inversely related : higher momentum diffusion means lower spatial diffusion as the particles isotropize their velocities more easily .",
    "there are two types of waves that could be important for cosmic ray scattering .",

    "their group and phase velocity parallel to the mean field is the alfvn speed @xmath138 for ion density @xmath139 .",

    "when @xmath142 , the phase speed of the fast mode can be large along the field lines : @xmath143 in the low @xmath144 limit ( @xmath144 is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures , @xmath145 ) and @xmath146 in the high @xmath144 limit .",
    "this speed is important for cosmic rays because they also move quickly along the field lines and will resonate with the magnetic fluctuations in these waves .",
    "oblique magnetosonic waves also have a magnetic pressure that varies slightly along the field as a result of the successive convergences and divergences of the velocity and field , which are in phase for fast waves and out of phase for slow waves .",
    "these field line changes create magnetic mirrors that enhance the scattering ( schlickeiser & miller 1998 , ragot 2000 ) .",
    "the condition for resonance between a cosmic ray and a wave is ( jokipii 1966 , hall & sturrock 1967 , hasselmann & wibberenz 1968 ) @xmath147 this expression says that the doppler shifted frequency of the magnetic wave , as viewed by the particle moving parallel to the field at speed @xmath148 for pitch angle @xmath101 , equals an integer number , @xmath4 , of the gyration frequency . for an alfvn wave , @xmath149 , and for a fast mode at low @xmath144 , @xmath150 . the case @xmath151 is gyroresonance . for wave spectra that decrease with @xmath26 as a power law ,",

    "such a particle slows down when it hits the compressive part of the wave ahead of it ( by the mirror effect ) , and it speeds up if the compressive part hits the particle from behind . as a particle oscillates between crests , it can have a parallel velocity that resonates with another wave moving faster along the field , and then jump over to become trapped between two new crests . for a broad wave spectrum ,",
    "the particle jumps from one wave to the next , gaining energy on average . this process is called transit time acceleration of particles or transit time damping ( ttd ) of waves ( miller 1997 , schlickeiser & miller 1998 ) .",
    "ttd increases the parallel component of cosmic ray momentum by mirror scattering in the wave frame .",
    "the mirror force depends on the square of the perpendicular component of the velocity ( section [ sect : mirror ] ) , so ttd must operate with the pitch - angle scattering of gyroresonance to maintain momentum isotropy ( miller 1997 ) .    a particle that interacts with an alfvn wave can resonate only with the wavelength that is equal to the parallel gyrolength in the doppler shifted frame , @xmath154 .",
    "a particle that interacts with magnetosonic waves can respond to the whole wave spectrum because it can choose the wave direction @xmath137 where the parallel wave speed equals its own ( schlickeiser & miller 1998 , schlickeiser & vainio 1999 ) . in practice , such a wave field may not have the appropriate @xmath137 because wave damping is larger at higher @xmath137 .",
    "ttd was originally thought to be such an important energy loss for the waves that the fast mode would not be important for cosmic rays ( schlickeiser 1994 , minter & spangler 1997 , tsap 2000 ) .",
    "damping is large for high @xmath144 because the thermal particles resonate with the waves and only highly parallel modes exist ( holman et al .",

    "however , @xmath155 in the solar wind and in much of the cool dense phase of the ism , and observations of the solar wind show that oblique and fast modes dominate over plane - parallel alfvn waves ( tu , marsch & thieme 1989 ; bieber , wanner & matthaeus 1996 ; matthaeus , goldstein & roberts 1990 ) . thus , ttd particle acceleration could be important in parts of the ism where @xmath144 is small",
    ". the waves still have to be nearly isotropic to get effective scattering , though , and they should not be damped by other processes , such as ion - neutral or viscous friction .",
    "such damping is important in most of the neutral medium where @xmath156 is otherwise favorable for ttd ( kulsrud & pearce 1969 , felice & kulsrud 2001 ) .",
    "this leaves few places where wave damping is low enough that ttd might be important .",
    "alfvn wave scattering is questionable too because of the extreme anisotropy of the fluctuations that may cascade down from pc scales to the gyroradius .",
    "anisotropic turbulence produces tiny perpendicular irregularities that average out over a particle gyration ( chandran 2000a , 2001 ; lerche & schlickeiser 2001 ; yan & lazarian 2002 ; teufel , lerche & schlickeiser 2003 ) . the result is a scattering coefficient that is many orders of magnitude less than in the isotropic case . for this reason",
    ", yan & lazarian ( 2003a ) reconsidered ttd scattering by fast modes at moderate @xmath144 , emphasizing the isotropy of the fast waves and considering ism regions where wave damping at particular cosmic ray energies is relatively small .",
    "the resolution of this damping problem for wave scattering is far from clear .",
    "the energy of fast cosmic ray gyrations is adiabatically invariant during slow changes in the magnetic field amplitude , so an increasing field puts more energy into the gyromotion while removing it from the parallel motion .",
    "this change , combined with momentum conservation , causes fast particles with high pitch angles to bounce off converging field lines .",
    "the mirror force is @xmath157 for magnetic moment @xmath158 with particle mass @xmath94 .",
    "this type of scattering involves very long wavelengths parallel to the field ( ragot 1999 , 2000 ; felice & kulsrud 2001 ; lu et al .",

    "electric fields can also scatter cosmic rays .",
    "the flow of plasma at speed @xmath159 transverse to a magnetic field generates an electric field , @xmath160 , that can be important in the parallel direction when the magnetic field has at least 2d structure , and it is convected around by turbulent motions ( fedorov et al .",

    "this is important for radial diffusion in the solar wind , which has a spiral field ( chen & bieber 1993 ) , for diffusion in oblique shock fronts ( duffy et al .",
    "1995 ) , and for diffusion in the vertical direction out of the galaxy . magnetic fields with irregularities smaller than the gyroradius cause particles to skip over field lines , giving anomalous diffusion ( parker 1964 ; chuvilgin & ptuskin 1993 ; casse , lemoine & pelletier 2002 ; otsuka & hada 2003 ; erlykin et al .",
    "braided field lines can lead to sub - diffusion ( getmantsev 1963 ) , when the mean squared particle position in the cross field direction increases as the square root of time , instead of directly with time as in normal diffusion .",

    "the cross - field diffusion coefficient is 0.10.2 of the parallel coefficient ( chandran & maron 2004a ) .",
    "shocks provide another site for cosmic ray scattering .",
    "blandford & ostriker ( 1980 ) considered an ism made of cleared hot cavities from supernovae and showed how the resulting shocks could scatter and accelerate cosmic rays .",
    "bykov & toptygin ( 1985 ) extended this model to include secondary shocks that arise in the turbulence caused by the supernovae .",
    "klepach , ptuskin & zirakashvili ( 2000 ) included stellar wind shocks .",
    "the composite spectrum of cosmic rays from an ensemble of shocks in a supersonically turbulent medium was determined by schneider ( 1993 ) .",
    "in such a medium , the summed energy distribution for cosmic rays from all of the shocks is close to a power law , but there can be flat parts or bumps , unlike the energy distribution from a single shock ( see also achterberg 1990 , bykov & toptygin 1993 ) .",
    "cosmic rays gain energy as they scatter off randomly moving parts of the ism ( fermi 1949 ) .",
    "this is momentum diffusion and called the second - order fermi mechanism because the energy gained per collision depends on the second power of the rms turbulent speed .",
    "it is reminiscent of the thermalization of a star cluster with the light particles gaining speed as they approach equilibrium with the heavy particles .",
    "scott & chevalier ( 1975 ) first applied this mechanism to supernova remnants , using random motions inside the remnant for scattering sites .",
    "supernovae are a likely source for cosmic rays because the cosmic ray energy density , @xmath11 ev @xmath64 , divided by a @xmath115 my lifetime in the galaxy , is about 5% of the total supernova power ( baade & zwicky 1934 , ginzburg & syrovatskii 1964 ) .",
    "cosmic ray acceleration by momentum diffusion occurs throughout a compressibly turbulent ism , not just in supernova remnants ( kulsrud & ferrari 1978 , ptuskin 1988 , dolginov & silantev 1990 , bykov & toptygin 1993 , webb et al .",

    "also get accelerated every time these regions are compressed ( jokipii 1987 ) .",
    "multiple shock crossings at the edge of a supernova remnant also accelerate cosmic rays ( see review in blandford & eichler 1987 ) . if the field is parallel to the shock direction , then magnetic turbulence created ahead of the shock by the outward streaming particles ( wentzel 1974 , skilling 1975 ) scatters these particles back into the shock where they encounter more turbulence .",
    "the post - shock turbulence was formerly pre - shock turbulence that got compressed and amplified ( schlickeiser , campeanu & lerche 1993 ; vainio & schlickeiser 1998 ) . if the field is oblique to the shock direction , then gyromotions ( jokipii 1987 ) and field line wandering cycle particles through the front ( ragot 2001 ) .",
    "each time a particle cycles through the front it gains energy from the converging flow .",
    "this is called the first - order fermi mechanism ( fermi 1954 ) because the energy gained per crossing depends on the first power of the shock velocity .",

    "observations of the edge sharpness of supernova remnants suggest the amplitude of mhd waves near the shock is @xmath160 times the average ism value ( achterberg , blandford & reynolds 1994 ) .",
    "simonetti ( 1992 ) observed a factor of at least 10 in the magnetic wave amplitude from faraday rotation irregularities in a supernova remnant compared with the adjacent line of sight .",
    "the x - ray synchrotron emission from supernova remnants is direct evidence for acceleration of relativistic electrons ( koyama et al .",

    "a collection of particles with a high enough density can not stream along a magnetic field much faster than the alfvn speed because they generate magnetic irregularities that scatter them ( lerche 1967 ; wentzel 1968a , 1969 ; kulsrud & pearce 1969 ; tademaru 1969 ) .",
    "the growth rate of the instability at wavenumber @xmath26 for isotropic wave generation is ( cesarsky 1980 ) @xmath163 the first term in the parenthesis represents the stabilizing effect of wave damping from ion gyromotions .",
    "the second term drives the instability with a rate proportional to the ratio of the streaming speed to the alfvn speed .",
    "the influence of collective effects is in the ratio of the density of those cosmic rays that resonate with wavenumber @xmath26 to the background density of thermal ions .",
    "the size of the magnetic irregularity produced is about @xmath164 times the particle gyroradius ( @xmath110@xmath165 cm for gev energy and @xmath166gauss field ) , so more energetic particles make larger - scale field distortions .",
    "these distortions are not at the bottom of a turbulent cascade , so they should not be anisotropic ( chandran 2000a ) .",

    "1997 ) .",
    "hall ( 1980 ) suggested that waves generated by cosmic rays would damp quickly and proposed instead that scintillation - scale structures result from mirror and firehose instabilities in the hot ism phase .",
    "both require pressure anisotropies , which hall notes should arise at the level of 0.01 - 0.1 if the hot medium is turbulent .",
    "the firehose instability requires @xmath167 for parallel and perpendicular pressures @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( lerche 1966 , wentzel 1968b ) , and the mirror instability requires @xmath170 .",

    "one of the earliest indications that the ism is turbulent came from scintillation observations of electron density fluctuations on very small scales .",
    "these fluctuations cause diffraction and refraction of radio signals from pulsars and a few extragalactic sources .",
    "diffraction broadens pulsar images , spreads out the pulse arrival times , and narrows the frequency interval over which the pulses have a coherent behavior .",
    "the relative motion of the diffracting medium also modulates the pulsar intensity on a timescale of minutes .",

    "still , the origin of this turbulence is not clear .",
    "because the scales are very small , typically @xmath83 cm or below , it could be part of a cascade from larger structures past the viscous length and down into the collisionless regime of mhd turbulence ( section 4.11 in _ interstellar turbulence i _ ) , or it could be generated locally by cosmic ray streaming or other small - scale instabilities or by low - mass stellar winds and wakes ( sections 3 and [ sect : cr ] in _ interstellar turbulence i _ ) .",

    "the correlation at 610 mhz for 28 sources fit kolmogorov scaling ( @xmath192 ) better than a shock - dominated model ( @xmath261 ) model but at 100 mhz the kolmogorov fit was not as good .",

    "rickett , lyne & gupta ( 1997 ) suggested this excess scattering could be from au - sized ionized clumps at cloud edges .",
    "an inner scale of @xmath266 cm was found by spangler & gwinn ( 1990 ) after noting that interferometer baselines shorter than this had scintillation with @xmath2674 whereas longer baselines had @xmath101 near the kolmogorov value , @xmath268 .",
    "they suggested the inner scale is caused by a lack of turbulence smaller than the ion gyroradius , @xmath269 for thermal speed @xmath270 , or by the ion inertial length , @xmath271 , whichever is larger .",
    "this value of the inner scale is consistent with an origin of the scattering in the warm ionized medium or in _ h ii _ regions , but not in the hot coronal medium , which has much larger minimum lengths .",

    "1994 , lazio et al .",
    "2000 ) , in support of the shock model .",

    "1987 , clegg et al .",

    "the amplitude , slope , and anisotropy of the power spectrum of interstellar electron density fluctuations have been observed by scintillation experiments .",
    "estimates for the inner scale of these fluctuations range from @xmath54 cm to @xmath262 cm or more .",
    "the shorter of these lengths is about the ion gyroradius in the warm ionized medium ( spangler & gwinn 1990 ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the mean free path for electron collisions so the fluctuations are collisionless ( see _ interstellar turbulence i _ ) .",
    "a lower limit to the largest scale of @xmath110@xmath282 cm was inferred from rotation measures assuming a continuous power law for fluctuations , but this assumption is uncertain .",
    "the slope of the power spectrum is usually close to the kolmogorov value , @xmath268 , and distinct from the slope for a field of discontinuities , which is @xmath283 .",
    "deviations from the kolmogorov slope appear in some studies , and may be from a large inner scale , @xmath284 cm , an excess of scattering sites having size @xmath1110 au , or a transition in the scaling properties of the turbulence .",
    "scintillation arises from both the low - density , diffuse , ionized ism and the higher - density _ h ii _ regions , ionized cloud edges , and hot shells , where the amplitude of the power spectrum increases . on average ,",
    "the relative fluctuations are extremely small , @xmath285 on scales that dominate the diffraction at ghz radio frequencies , @xmath286 cm ( cordes et al .",
    "1985 ) . for a kolmogorov spectrum",
    ", they would be larger on larger scales in proportion to @xmath287 ; if the spectrum is continuous up to pc scales , the absolute fluctuation amplitude there would be @xmath11 ( lee & jokipii 1976 ) .",
    "anisotropy of scattered images is at the level of 50% , which is consistent with extremely large intrinsic anisotropies ( @xmath288 ) from mhd turbulence ( sections 4.11 and 4.13 in _ interstellar turbulence i _ )",
    "if many orientations on the line of sight are blended together .",
    "the turbulence that is observed directly on resolvable scales in the ism also has important effects on very small scales , down to the level of atomic diffusion , mixing , and viscosity , and continuing far below to the thermal ion gyroradius .",
    "the resolvable turbulence in the neutral medium was reviewed in the first part of this series ( _ interstellar turbulence i _ ) , along with general theory and simulations .",
    "the smaller scale implications were reviewed here .",
    "turbulence helps to disperse the elements made in supernovae and other stellar sources by stretching and folding the contaminated gas until the gradient length approaches the collision mean free path .",
    "then atomic diffusion does the final step of interatomic mixing .",
    "this mixing and homogenization may occur partly at the source , in the shock fronts and contact discontinuities around the expanding flow following dynamical instabilities , and it may occur partly in the ambient ism after the expansion subsides .",
    "observations suggest that the dispersion in elemental abundances among stars inside clusters and field stars of the same age , and the abundance differences between hii regions and diffuse clouds , are only a few percent up to perhaps 30% .",
    "observations of clusters also suggest that most of the mixing occurs within several times @xmath2 years .",
    "this homogenization has to occur between the injection scale of supernovae and superbubble explosions and the star formation scale containing on the order of a solar mass .",
    "the corresponding range of spatial scales is @xmath289 for gas at the ambient density .",
    "homogenization can not be significant on scales much larger than a superbubble , because then it would diminish the galactic radial abundance gradient over a hubble time .",
    "these gradients enter the problem in another way too because turbulence mixes the gas over galactic radius to increase the elemental dispersion locally at the same time as it mixes this gas locally and leads to homogenization .",
    "while the distribution of elemental abundances appears to be fairly narrow , with a dispersion on the order of 10% , it may also have a fat tail caused by occasional odd stars and diffuse clouds with very different abundances .",
    "this tail is reminiscent of other fat tails in the distribution functions for turbulent media , and these other tails seem to originate with intermittency . in the case of elemental dispersion",
    ", this means that the homogenization process is spotty so some regions survive for long periods of time with very little mixing .",
    "several methods for studying turbulent mixing have been employed .",
    "because of the wide range of scales involved , these studies often employ simplifying assumptions that appear to capture the essential physics .",
    "they include artificial stochastic velocity fields and closure methods using moment equations .",
    "direct numerical simulations of ism elemental dispersion have only just begun .",
    "the theory suggests that a turbulent medium mixes passive scalars like elemental abundances faster than a gaussian velocity field because of the long - range correlations that are associated with turbulence .",
    "turbulence affects interstellar chemistry by mixing regions with different properties , heating the gas intermittently on the viscous scale , and enhancing ion - neutral collisions in regions with strong magnetic field gradients .",
    "turbulent mixing is more far - reaching than diffusive mixing because of long - range correlated motions in a turbulent flow . such mixing spreads out each chemical species over a large radial range inside a cloud .",
    "turbulent heating promotes temperature - sensitive reactions inside otherwise cold clouds .",
    "applications to the formation of ch@xmath59 and oh in diffuse clouds look promising .",
    "chemical reaction networks that include these turbulent processes are only beginning to understand some of the implications , and direct simulations of chemistry in a turbulent medium are limited to only a few studies so far .",
    "the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays depends strongly on the presence of turbulence in the ism .",
    "the scale for this turbulence is the gyroradius , which is less than the collisional mean free path for most cosmic rays , which have energies less than 1 gev .",
    "thus , scattering relies entirely on magnetic irregularities in collisionless plasma turbulence .",
    "cosmic ray acceleration is by two processes , both of which involve turbulence : the first - order fermi mechanism accelerates cosmic rays by cycling them through shock fronts where they pick up a relative velocity kick comparable to the shock speed at each passage .",
    "this cycling occurs because magnetic irregularities on each side of the front scatter the out - streaming cosmic rays back into the front .",
    "the second - order fermi mechanism accelerates cosmic rays through turbulent diffusion .",
    "each collision with a randomly moving magnetic irregularity turns the cosmic ray around with a reflection speed in the moving frame that is comparable to the incident speed . over time , the result is a transfer of energy from the turbulence to the cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic ray scattering occurs in several ways . fast moving particles",
    "can interact weakly but resonantly with numerous magnetic irregularities , and successive interactions of this type can randomly change the pitch angles of their helical motions along the field .",
    "this eventually leads to a complete reversal in the direction of motion .",
    "cosmic rays can also interact strongly with large magnetic irregularities , as would occur in shock fronts and at the edges of dense cloud complexes .",
    "these interactions change the particle directions significantly each time .",
    "the nature of cosmic ray diffusion in both momentum and space is not understood well because the structure and strength of the important magnetic irregularities are not observed directly .",
    "if mhd turbulence is highly anisotropic on the scale of cosmic ray scattering , with transverse irregularities much stronger than parallel as suggested by theory , then resonant scattering processes during motions along the mean field can be very weak .",
    "the structure of magnetic waves below the mean free path is also unclear , as the usual fast and slow magnetosonic modes do not exist .",
    "cosmic rays can also generate turbulence by streaming instabilities following particle - wave resonances or by fire - hose and mirror instabilities that operate even without resonances .",
    "the expected anisotropy of alfvn wave turbulence diminishes the first of these mechanisms significantly , however .",
    "the others are problematic because they require strong cosmic ray pressure anisotropies . as a result ,",
    "the impact of cosmic rays on turbulence is currently not understood .",
    "radio wave scintillation is indirect evidence for interstellar plasma turbulence .",
    "these radio observations span a very wide range of spatial scales through a combination of diffraction and refraction effects .",
    "the scales are mostly below the collision mean free path , and they are far below the limits of angular resolution .",
    "the first of these limits makes it difficult to understand the origin of the density irregularities . unlike the turbulence that scatters cosmic rays , which requires only magnetic irregularities and no density structure , the turbulence that causes scintillation requires small - scale density irregularities in the ionized medium .",
    "the associated magnetic irregularities are not observed , and the connection to cosmic ray scattering is unclear , even though the length scales are about the same .",
    "the origin of density structures below the collision mean free path is unknown .",
    "atomic diffusion should smooth them out on a sound crossing time unless magnetic field irregularities hold them in place . in that case",
    "they could be the result of slight temperature variations , with the cooler regions having higher electron densities , all divided up and mixed together by transverse magnetic motions .",
    "the nature of these motions below the mean free path is unclear , because , as mentioned above , the usual fast and slow compressional modes do not exist , nor do the usual thermal and pressure - regulated processes .",
    "the second of the two limits on spatial scale imply that the geometrical properties of scintillation turbulence are difficult to observe .",
    "the scintillation is clearly anisotropic , but whether it is in sheets or filaments , for example , is unknown .",
    "the importance of scintillation observations for studies of ism turbulence is that they give the power spectrum of electron density fluctuations fairly accurately .",
    "this is usually close to the kolmogorov spectrum of incompressible turbulence .",
    "rarely are the spectra so steep that the medium can be interpreted as a superposition of sharp edges , like shock fronts .",
    "one recent observation with fairly high precision obtained the relatively shallow iroshnikov - kraichnan power spectrum , leading to the conjecture that the slope varies from region to region .",
    "as discussed in _",
    "interstellar turbulence i _",
    ", this variation may arise from a variation in the relative strength of the magnetic field compared to the turbulent motions , with the iroshnikov - kraichnan spectrum present in regions of relatively strong fields .",
    "observations suggest that scintillation arises in a distributed fashion from the ambient ionized medium and also from discrete high - density places like the edges of local bubbles , ionized molecular clouds , and hii regions .",
    "these discrete regions are likely to be highly turbulent and they also have a juxtaposition of hot and cool gas , which is necessary for isentropic mixing and electron density structure .",
    "there are evidently many uncertainties in the nature of ism turbulence on small scales , even though the evidence for this turbulence is pervasive .",
    "part of the problem is that none of the features of this turbulence have been observed directly : not the densities , magnetic fields , temperatures , or motions .",
    "still , the density irregularities are revealed indirectly through scintillation , the magnetic field irregularities through cosmic ray scattering , the temperature fluctuations through chemistry , and the motions through elemental and chemical mixing .",
    "an additional problem is that many small scale effects of ism turbulence rely on details of the theory that are independent of the usual scaling relations , such as viscous heating and elemental diffusion , which arise at the bottom of the cascade in the neutral medium .",
    "turbulence in the ionized medium is also below the collisional mean free path , where pressure and thermal effects are relatively unimportant .",
    "moreover , the small scale ism processes are often strongly dependent on the large scale processes , such as turbulent shock formation , energy and metal injection , and galactic - scale gradients .",
    "this means that direct simulations of small scale turbulence are impossible without simplifying assumptions about the large - scale medium ",
    "assumptions that require more knowledge about ism turbulence on the large scale than is presently available .",
    "while the observations and theory of ism turbulence have come a long way from the first efforts in the 1950s , the details of this new information have led to a growing awareness that the complete problem is far too large to solve any time soon .",
    "we rely on future generations of astronomers and physicists to continue this work , and hope that they find this field as intriguing and challenging as we do today .",
