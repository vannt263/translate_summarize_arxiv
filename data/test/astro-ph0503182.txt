    ".    long - period variables such as iktau often exhibit circumstellar maser emission in one or more molecular species ( i.e. oh , h@xmath5o or sio ) .",
    "iktau is one such star that has maser emission in all three species .",
    "the oh and h@xmath5o masers toward iktau have been mapped using connected element and radio - linked interferometers @xcite revealing the structure of the circumstellar envelope ( cse ) on both large scales ( @xmath11 traced by the oh masers ) and intermediate scales ( 200350 mas traced by the h@xmath5o masers ) .",
    "such studies have been useful in determining the structure of the cse on these scales .",
    "the sio masers , which lie close to the star , provide a unique probe of the morphology of the cse and the velocity of the gas in a region just a few stellar radii from the photosphere .",
    "previous very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations of long - period variables have demonstrated the various morphologies that exist in the sio maser region . some stars exhibit ring - like sio maser distributions @xcite , while others ( e.g. nmlcyg ) show more elliptical distributions @xcite .",
    "previous sio maser studies have also revealed the velocity structure of the nearby cse to be complex showing elements of contraction @xcite , expansion @xcite , and even rotation @xcite . in this article",
    ", we present the results from our vlbi observations of the sio maser emission toward the long - period variable iktau .",
    "we discuss how these observations fit into the overall picture of the cse as traced by the various maser species and the possibility of axial symmetry and rotation in the envelope of iktau .",
    "we observed the @xmath0 , sio maser emission toward iktau ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , j2000 ) on 1996 april 5 from 20:00 to 24:00 ut .",
    "based on a period of 470 days @xcite and a maximum at jd2439440 @xcite the stellar phase of iktau was @xmath20.85 during the epoch of our observations .",
    "iktau and a continuum calibrator ( 0423 - 013 ) were observed using the 10 stations of the vlba plus a single antenna of the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "both the vlba and vla are operated by the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) . a reference frequency of 43.122027ghz",
    "was used for the @xmath0 sio transition .",
    "data were recorded in dual circular polarization using a single 4-mhz ( 27.8kms@xmath4 ) band centered on the local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity of 34.0kms@xmath4 .",
    "system temperatures and point source sensitivities were on the order of @xmath2150k and @xmath211jyk@xmath4 respectively .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator operated by the nrao in socorro , new mexico .",
    "auto and cross - correlation spectra consisting of 128 channels with channel spacings of 31.25khz ( @xmath20.2kms@xmath4 ) were produced by the correlator .",
    "calibration was performed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) maintained by nrao .",
    "total intensity ( stokes @xmath14 ) data were calibrated in accordance with the procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "the bandpass response was determined from scans on the continuum calibrator and used to correct the target source data .",
    "the time - dependent gains of all antennas relative to a reference antenna were determined by fitting a total - power spectrum ( from the reference antenna with the target source at a high elevation ) to the total power spectrum of each antenna .",
    "the absolute flux density scale was established by scaling these gains by the system temperature and gain of the reference antenna .",
    "errors in the gain and pointing of the reference antenna and the atmospheric opacity contribute to the error in the absolute amplitude calibration , which is accurate to about 1520% .",
    "residual group delays were determined by performing a fringe fit to the continuum calibrator sources and were applied to the spectral line data .",
    "residual fringe - rate solutions were obtained by fringe - fitting a strong reference feature in the channel at @xmath15kms@xmath4 and were applied to all channels in the spectrum .",
    "an iterative self - calibration and imaging procedure was performed to map the reference channel at 36.2kms@xmath4 .",
    "the resulting phase solutions were applied to all channels in the band .",
    "images of the sio maser emission consisting of @xmath16 pixels ( @xmath2@xmath17mas ) were generated using a synthesized beam of @xmath18mas in natural weighting .",
    "images were produced for spectral channels from 28.8kms@xmath4 to 41.6kms@xmath4 forming an image cube of 60 planes .",
    "off - source rms noise estimates in the spectral channel images range from 10mjybeam@xmath4 in planes with weak or no maser emission to 80mjybeam@xmath4 in dynamic - range limited planes containing strong ( @xmath1915jybeam@xmath4 ) maser emission .",

    "the dashed circle in the figure represents the stellar photosphere with a diameter of 20.2mas .",
    "this diameter was determined from a uniform disk ( ud ) diameter fit to combined keck aperture - masking data and infrared - optical telescope array ( iota ) data in the near infrared @xcite .",
    "it is apparent from figure [ iktau_isum ] that the sio masers toward iktau form an elongated ring roughly @xmath20mas across oriented in the ne ",
    "sw direction .",
    "if the star is assumed to be in the center of the distribution , maser distances range from @xmath21.62.8 stellar radii .    in order to identify and parameterize maser components , two - dimensional gaussian functions were fit to the emission in each spectral ( velocity ) channel using the aips task sad .",
    "image quality was assessed using the off - source rms noise and the deepest negative pixel in the image . a cutoff , above which emission features were fit , was conservatively set to the greater of 10@xmath21 or 80% of the absolute value of the deepest negative pixel in the plane .",
    "errors reported by sad were based on the source size divided by twice the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the image and ranged from 5@xmath6as for features with high snr , to 371@xmath6as for features with lower snr .",
    "the emission features identified by sad are represented by the circles in figure [ iktau_spot ] . in the figure ,",
    "point sizes are are proportional to the logarithm of the fitted flux density which ranged from 0.2 to 18.3jy . comparing figures 1 and 2 , we see that the identified features accurately represent the emission summed over all velocity channels in the image cube .",
    "figures [ iktau_isum ] and [ iktau_spot ] show that the distribution of the 43.1-ghz sio maser emission toward iktau was clearly not circularly symmetric during the epoch of our observations .",
    "instead , the distribution appears to be elongated along an axis running from the northeast to the southwest in the images .",
    "we characterized this morphology by performing a least squares fit of an ellipse to the distribution of masers weighted by the flux density of each component .",
    "the resulting ellipse is plotted in figure [ iktau_spot ] .",
    "the lengths of the semimajor and semiminor axes were found to be 29mas and 16mas respectively with the semimajor axis of the ellipse oriented at 59@xmath3 measured east of north . at the assumed distance to iktau of 250pc , the distribution of sio masers is approximately @xmath22au .",
    "the sio maser distributions of @xmath2320 late - type stars have previously been imaged with angular resolutions provided by vlbi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of these stars , ik tau , with an axial ratio of @xmath21.8:1 , appears to have one of the most elongated sio rings yet observed .",
    "as mentioned previously , @xcite were able to separate the near - infrared stellar and dust contributions and determine a ud diameter of 20.2mas for the photosphere of iktau .",
    "however , they found that the longest ( 27 m ) iota baseline data were inconsistent with this fit , and the data were thus ignored .",
    "possible explanations for this deviation are departures from uniform photospheric brightness ( e.g. stellar hot spots or extended molecular emission ) , or the presence of a binary companion @xcite .    the circumstellar dust shell , typically outside the sio maser region , has been observed for iktau using long baseline interferometers operating at mid - infrared @xcite and near - infrared @xcite wavelengths .",
    "@xcite found that their infrared spatial interferometer ( isi ) 11@xmath6 m visibilities were best fit by a three spherically symmetric concentric dust shells .",
    "however , @xcite state that their keck - iota data , which includes multiple late - type stars , suggest that the popular strategy of incorporating multiple spherically symmetric shells to model deviations from simple uniform outflow might be misguided and that clumpiness and global asymmetry should be considered more seriously .",
    "in fact , @xcite report that the visibility data for iktau shows signs of asymmetries for the dust shell but the data are not of sufficient quality to make a definitive determination .    beyond the regions of the sio masers and circumstellar dust shell",
    ", there is evidence for axisymmetric structures in the cse of iktau . on large angular scales",
    ", @xcite found that the 1612-mhz oh masers form an elongated ring @xmath23.5@xmath24 with a nw  se orientation of the long axis .",
    "the axisymmetry is especially apparent at high velocities ( @xmath25kms@xmath4 ) where nearly all of the emission originates to the se and nw of the star .",
    "observations of the 22-ghz h@xmath5o masers with the vla @xcite and the multi element radio linked interferometer network ( merlin ) @xcite show similar axial symmetry with respect to the nw ",
    "se direction .",
    "vla observations by @xcite show that the low - velocity masers have a ring - like distribution , while the high - velocity masers have a flattened distribution with a nw  se orientation .",
    "the overall size of the shell was roughly 330mas .",
    "the vla data of @xcite show the h@xmath5o maser distribution to be @xmath2220mas across with a similar elongation in the nw ",
    "se direction .",
    "the merlin images of @xcite show bright blue- and red - shifted emission distributed over an elliptical region approximately 100@xmath26  200mas superimposed on a fainter spherical region of emission from all spectral channels .",
    "the observed ne  sw orientation for the elliptical sio maser distribution is roughly orthogonal to elongations of the h@xmath5o and oh maser distributions .",
    "@xcite suggest that the axisymmetric structures seen in the oh and h@xmath5o maser shells for certain late - type stars are a result of the density distribution of gas and dust in the cse .",
    "they conclude that the density distribution is latitude dependent with the total density decreasing as the latitude increases from the rotationally defined equatorial plane . in stars in which both the oh and h@xmath5o masers",
    "are axially symmetric ( e.g. iktau ) @xcite suggest that the distributions should be aligned parallel along the equatorial plane since the density enhancement is conducive to the formation of the h@xmath5o masers ( assuming these masers are collisionally pumped ) and since the oh masers are the result of the photodissociation of the h@xmath5o by the surrounding uv radiation .",
    "@xcite state that their merlin data are also supportive of a nw  se equator for iktau with the brightest h@xmath5o masers observed along this axis as expected . assuming this nw  se axis is parallel to the equator of iktau as suggested by the oh and h@xmath5o maser observations , then the elongation we observe in the sio maser distribution is along an axis roughly perpedicular to the equator and possibly parallel to the polar axis of the star .",
    "the importance of this geometry will become apparent in the discussion of the velocity structure of the sio masers in the next section .",
    "the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity information derived from our vlba data is shown in figure [ iktau_vel ] .",
    "the top panel shows the spectrum of sio maser emission from 2842kms@xmath4 color coded by los velocity in increments of 1.5kms@xmath4 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ iktau_vel ] shows the sio masers plotted in the same velocity color coding as the top panel , with the color of the maser spot representing its corresponding velocity in the spectrum .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that there is a symmetry axis for the velocity structure of the sio maser emission toward iktau with the northwestern side of the shell dominated by blue - shifted masers ( relative to the assumed stellar velocity of 35kms@xmath4 ) and the southeastern side of the shell dominated by red - shifted masers .",
    "such velocity distributions in which blue and red - shifted sio masers occur on opposite sides of the star have previously been observed for nmlcyg @xcite , raqr @xcite , oh231.8 + 4.2 @xcite . for nmlcyg and raqr , the maser velocity distributions suggested rotation of their respective maser shells . in the case of oh231.8",
    "+ 4.2 @xcite concluded that the maser distribution could be modeled by a rotating , contracting torus of emission .",
    "the ring - like distributions typically observed in vlba studies of sio masers indicate the masers are amplified in a direction perpendicular to the radial direction ( i.e. tangential amplification ) @xcite .",
    "this amplification occurs along the longest path lengths parallel to the observers line of sight . assuming this is the case for iktau , then the velocity structure shown in figure [ iktau_vel ] suggests a nw to se rotation of the maser shell with the axis of rotation near the elongation axis of the distribution .",
    "such a rotation axis is in agreement with a ne  sw equator for iktau as indicated by the previous oh and h@xmath5o maser observations mentioned above .",
    "rotation is not a new concept with regards to the masers in the cse of iktau .",
    "@xcite considered models with radial expansion combined with keplerian rotation to explain the axisymmetric geometries observed for the 1612 mhz oh masers .",
    "they concluded that although rotation could not unequivocally be ruled out , the data did not support rotation as a primary component in the kinematics of the oh shell .",
    "additionally , @xcite found that the plot of radius versus velocity for their h@xmath5o maser data was reminiscent of models of accelerating or axisymmetric outflow with a possible rotational component .    to better characterize the velocity structure of the sio emission",
    ", we investigated a number of models with velocity components including rotation and expansion / contraction .",
    "modeling the three - dimensional velocity structure of the sio masers toward iktau is complicated by the elliptical distribution of the masers and by a lack of knowledge of the shell structure along the observer s line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the elliptical distribution of the masers could be modeled by either a ellipsoidal shell or an inclined torus similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we chose an ellipsoidal shell based on the assumption that the masers are tangentially amplified and the fact that nearly a full ring of emission is observed . in the case of a torus with tangential amplification",
    "one would expect to see only two regions of emisison on opposite sides of the star as was observed by @xcite .",
    "models developed for iktau are based on a prolate spheroid with the long axis oriented at a position angle of 59@xmath27 ( as suggested by the elliptical fit shown in figure [ iktau_spot ] ) .",
    "since the true three - dimensional shape of the maser shell is unknown , the axis of the ellipsoidal model along the observers los was assumed to be the same size as the minor axis of the model in the plane of the sky .",
    "additionally , the inclination of the ellipsoid was assumed to be zero .",
    "the models were compared  by eye \" to the actual data to determine how well they reproduced the true maser spatial and velocity distributions . to make the comparison easier we plotted the data and the models in a manner similar to that presented in @xcite with three different views .",
    "figure [ iktau_model ] shows the vlba data plotted in the three panels on the left .",
    "the top panel plots the maser distribution with the same color - coding as that of figure [ iktau_vel ] along with a set of axes ( @xmath28,@xmath29 ) determined from the elliptical fit of figure [ iktau_spot ] .",
    "the middle panel plots the component los velocity versus its position along the equatorial ( @xmath28 ) axis .",
    "the bottom panel plots the component los velocity versus its position along the polar ( @xmath29 ) axis .",
    "the right three panels of figure [ iktau_model ] plot the equivalent distributions derived from the model .",
    "the size and shape of the model shell ( i.e. major axis , minor axis and shell thickness ) were chosen to approximate the spatial distribution of the sio masers as seen in figure [ iktau_vel ] and the top - left panel of figure [ iktau_model ] .",
    "maser velocities were first modeled with a general form of rotation given by : @xmath30 it quickly became apparent that models including only rotation do not sufficiently approximate the maser data . in the middle - left panel of figure [ iktau_model ] , we see that there is a significant variation in position along the @xmath28-axis for masers with small ( @xmath312kms@xmath4 ) los velocities .",
    "it is this spread in position for low - velocity points that is difficult to model assuming only rotation .",
    "for example , solid - body rotation ( @xmath32 ) yields a simple linear variation of los velocity with position along the @xmath28-axis regardless of distance along the @xmath29-axis .",
    "keplerian rotation ( @xmath33 ) gives a greater variation in @xmath28-axis position for higher velocity masers , however , at lower velocities the positions are still confined to a narrow region in the @xmath34 vs. @xmath28 plot ( see figure 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "one way to produce the observed spread in position at small los velocities is to add an expansion term to the equation describing the motion of the masers in the shell .",
    "the los velocity for an elliptical shell which is in rotation and also has a component of constant velocity expansion , @xmath35 , can be written : @xmath36 where the rotational term is similar to that of @xcite ; note that the exponent @xmath37 allows for sub- or super - keplerian rotation . in equation 2",
    ", @xmath38 represents the mass of the star , @xmath39 is the stellar velocity , the angle @xmath40 is measured in the equatorial plane of the shell and the angle @xmath41 is the latitudinal coordinate of the shell .",
    "since the mass of iktau is unknown , 1@xmath42 was assumed for the model .",
    "the stellar velocity , @xmath39 , was assumed to be 35kms@xmath4 consistent with velocities determined from the midpoints of the spectra of the 1612 mhz oh masers , 33.2kms@xmath4 @xcite and the h@xmath5o masers 35.4kms@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "similar to the models of @xcite maser gain length was approximated by considering the distance along the path in which the los velocity changes by less than three times the doppler width of the line .",
    "amplification becomes negligible for velocity shifts greater than this limit @xcite .",
    "for sio we estimated a doppler line width @xmath43kms@xmath4 for a typical temperature of 1500k in the sio maser region @xcite .",
    "the maser gain length was further constrained to be greater than the minimum path length of @xmath44 cm necessary for sio maser emission @xcite and to be less than or equal to the physical los path length through the shell .    in practice ,",
    "a random point is chosen within the region determined by the geometric parameters of the shell ( i.e. size , orientation , thickness ) .",
    "the los velocity for this point is computed from equation 2 . from this point ,",
    "distances forwards and backwards along the observers line of sight are computed for which the los velocity changes by 1.5 times the doppler line width .",
    "thus , we have a line of points , with the chosen random point as the center , for which @xmath45 is within three times the doppler line width .",
    "if both ends of the line reside within the maser shell and the total length of the line is greater than the minimum path length required for maser emission , then the center point is kept and is color - coded according to its @xmath45 .",
    "otherwise , the point is rejected . in this manner ,",
    "the model builds up a distribution of points mapping both the structure of the shell and the maser velocity distribution .    the model shown in figure [ iktau_model ]",
    "is meant to provide a qualitative match to the iktau sio maser distribution .",
    "the parameters for the model are presented in table 1 .",
    "inner distances of 16mas and 28mas were used for the semiminor , @xmath46 , and semimajor , @xmath47 , axes respectively with a shell thickness of 3 mas . as mentioned previously the position angle for the ellipse",
    "was set to 59@xmath3 .",
    "the model is not particularly sensitive to this angle , and changes of @xmath235@xmath3 do not change the results significantly .",
    "the two parameters which affect the velocity structure are the exponent @xmath37 and the expansion velocity @xmath35 . through an iterative process of adjusting parameters and qualitatively comparing the model to the data",
    ", values of @xmath48 and @xmath49kms@xmath4 were determined . coincidentally , the value for @xmath37 is equivalent to that found for raqr by @xcite . as in the model for raqr ,",
    "the model for iktau is sensitive to small ( @xmath20.01 ) variations in the value of @xmath37 . unlike the raqr case , the mass of iktau is not well constrained , and variations in the assumed value for @xmath38 could allow for slight variations in the value of @xmath37 . to produce a similar model to that shown in figure [ iktau_model ] with pure keplerian motion ( @xmath50 ) would require a stellar mass @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , the model is sensitive to the the expansion velocity @xmath35 .",
    "changes on the order of @xmath21.0kms@xmath4 produce significant changes in the velocity distributions of the masers .    additionally , there is a trade - off between the model expansion velocity , and the quenching of the masers caused by the doppler line width limitation .",
    "larger values for @xmath35 tend to spread the distribution in the middle panel of the model plot , but only if @xmath52 is increased to allow the greater change in velocity and resulting longer gain lengths .",
    "the longer path lengths , in turn , create more masers in front of and behind the star , a characteristic which is clearly not evident in these or any other sio maser observations of which we are aware . as the top - right panel of figure [ iktau_model ] shows , the density distribution of masers resulting from the path length considerations is characterized by tangentially amplified masers along the limb of the shell . in order to limit maser emission along the line of sight to the star",
    ", the maser shell thickness must be @xmath23 the maser minimum path length . since we assumed a minimum maser path length of @xmath44 cm ( @xmath22.7mas at the assumed distance to iktau ) , the shell thickness was set to 2.6mas . without increasing the minimum required path length , increasing the maser shell thickness",
    "will produce masers along the line of sight to the star , thus filling in the distribution in the top - right panel of figure [ iktau_model ] .",
    "the expansion velocity @xmath49kms@xmath4 used in the model is consistent with observational evidence as found in proper motion studies of sio masers .",
    "@xcite measured the proper motions of the sio masers toward raqr and found an overall infall of the masers ( shell contraction ) with a velocity of @xmath24kms@xmath4 over stellar phases @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite , in an extensive study of the mira variable txcam , determined the dominant mode to be expansion of the sio masers , with radial proper motion magnitudes of @xmath2510kms@xmath4 between stellar phases @xmath54 .    from our single epoch of sio maser observations , it is difficult to tell whether the model expansion term represents a physical expansion or contraction of the maser shell .",
    "this is because both expansion and contraction produce nearly identical distributions in the both the middle- and lower - right panels of figure [ iktau_model ] .",
    "the only difference between a positive or negative expansion term is observable in the top - right panel of figure [ iktau_model ] .",
    "for example , if we consider only rotation of the shell , we find that all of the red - shifted masers occur along the positive @xmath28-axis ( the se side of the shell ) , and all of the blue - shifted masers occur along the negative @xmath28-axis ( nw side of the shell ) and the velocities are symmetric about the plane of the sky .",
    "the addition of a positive expansion term ( as was done for our model ) serves to rotate the blue - shifted velocities out of the plane of the sky toward the front of the shell closest to the observer and red - shifted velocities away from the observer .",
    "however , the actual masers are still confined to a region around the plane of the sky , thus the shift in the velocity structure is most easily observed near the poles along the @xmath29-axis where we see in the top - right panel of figure [ iktau_model ] that some low - velocity blue - shifted masers ( green ) have been shifted toward the positive @xmath28-axis .",
    "contraction of the shell has the opposite effect rotating the red - shifted velocity structure out of the plane toward the front of the shell and the blue - shifted velocities toward the back of the shell .",
    "it is practically impossible to tell from our maser data whether expansion or contraction is the case for the iktau shell .",
    "there seems to be a slight preference for blue - shifted masers in general and a tendency for some blue - shifted masers along the positive @xmath28-axis in the top - left panel of figure [ iktau_model ] , but this is highly dependent on the assumed stellar velocity of 35kms@xmath4 and the choice of position angle for the major axis of the ellipse .    the maser shell rotational velocities produced in the model are not considered extraordinary .",
    "the equatorial velocity at the distance of the mean semiminor axis of 16mas is @xmath23.6kms@xmath4 with a corresponding rotational period of @xmath233yr . at the ud photospheric distance of 10.1",
    "mas the equatorial velocity is @xmath24.6kms@xmath4 with a corresponding rotational period of @xmath216yr .",
    "these rotational velocities are consistent with observational measurements for raqr ( @xmath235kms@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and slightly lower than measurements for nmlcyg ( @xmath211kms@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and oh231.8 + 4.2 ( @xmath2710kms@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "significant stellar rotation velocities ( 10s to 100s of kms@xmath4 ) during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase have been invoked in theoretical studies of chemical mixing and the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in convective envelopes @xcite .",
    "stellar rotation is also factor in models describing the shaping of bipolar and elliptical planetary nebulae , and @xcite propose that agb stars above @xmath21.3@xmath55 can spin up their extended circumstellar envelopes to rotational speeds on the order of a kms@xmath4 .",
    "stellar rotation velocities of @xmath237kms@xmath4 are used in such models that result in equatorial density enhancements and eventually bipolar nebulae @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the collective maser observations of ik tau , which suggest rotation , axial symmetry , and equatorial density enhancement , may be indicating that ik tau is on its way to becoming such a bipolar planetary nebula .",
    "we have imaged the @xmath56 , sio maser emission toward the mira variable iktau .",
    "we find that the sio masers are distributed in an elongated ring roughly @xmath20mas ( @xmath22au at the adopted distance of 250 pc ) with the major axis of the ellipse at a position angle of @xmath259@xmath3 . the ne ",
    "sw elongation of the sio maser distribution is roughly perpendicular to the nw  se symmetry axis previously determined for the h@xmath5o and oh maser distributions .",
    "this elongation axis also provides an axis of symmetry for the los velocity structure of the sio masers .",
    "masers having velocities blue - shifted with respect to the assumed center velocity of 35kms@xmath4 were found to lie on the northwestern side of the shell while the southeastern side of the shell is dominated by red - shifted sio masers . under the assumption of tangentially amplified masers , this velocity distribution implies a nw to se rotation of the sio shell about a ne  sw rotation / polar axis",
    ". such a polar axis would be in agreement with models invoked to explain the h@xmath5o and oh maser geometries which suggest a nw  se equator for iktau .",
    "the inherent transient and irregular nature of sio maser emission in the atmospheres of long - period variables limits the comparison of models to a single epoch of vlbi data .",
    "however , we have attempted to approximate the iktau observations presented here assuming an ellipsoidal model of the sio maser shell .",
    "we favor a model that includes both rotation of the form @xmath57 and constant - velocity expansion / contraction as a representation of the velocity field in the cse of iktau at the distance of the sio maser shell .",
