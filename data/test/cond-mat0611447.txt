    "[ fig:7]a , the differential conductance for @xmath163 does not change monotonically with the angle @xmath9 .",
    "it increases first with increasing @xmath9 , reaches a local maximum , and then drops to a local minimum for @xmath9 close to the antiparallel configuration , and again slightly increases when approaching @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the maximum and minimum differential conductance occur for non - collinear configurations , and not for parallel and antiparallel ones .",
    "the local maximum in @xmath0 at the antiparallel configuration becomes smaller when the effect of exchange field is suppressed ( @xmath161 decreases ) and eventually disappears for @xmath164 by transforming into the global minimum of @xmath0 in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "similarly , the maximum at a non - collinear configuration disappears with decreasing @xmath161 and changes into a global maximum in the parallel configuration .",
    "the most characteristic features of transport characteristics in the presence of exchange field are the enhanced differential conductance at a non - collinear alignment and its rapid drop when approaching the antiparallel configuration .",
    "this is most visible in the curve for @xmath165 in fig .",
    "[ fig:7]a . in this case",
    "the differential conductance increases until the configuration becomes close to the antiparallel one , and then drops rapidly to the value of @xmath0 in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "the key role in this behavior is played by the first - order processes giving rise to the exchange field .",
    "these processes lead to the precession of spin in the dot , which facilitates tunneling processes and leads to an increase in the conductance as compared to the parallel configuration .",
    "when the configuration becomes close to the antiparallel one , the first - order processes become suppressed and the conductance drops to that for antiparallel alignment . for smaller @xmath161",
    "the drop in conductance begins at a smaller angle , which follows from the fact that now the relative role of exchange field decreases due to increased cotunneling rates .",
    "the nonmonotonic behavior of the differential conductance with @xmath9 leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of tmr .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7]b for several values of @xmath161 .",
    "the effects due to exchange field give rise to a local minimum in tmr at a non - collinear magnetic configuration .",
    "moreover , in this transport regime tmr changes sign and becomes negative .",
    "when the magnetic configuration is close to the antiparallel one , tmr starts to increase rapidly reaching maximum for @xmath13 .",
    "the negative tmr and its sudden increase when the configuration tends to the antiparallel one are a consequence of the processes leading to nonmonotonic behavior of the differential conductance , as described above .",
    "( color online ) the differential conductance ( a ) and tunnel magnetoresistance ( b ) as a function of angle between the leads magnetizations for several values of the level position @xmath2 , as indicated in the figure , and for @xmath166 .",
    "the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . ]",
    "to understand more intuitively the above presented behavior of the differential conductance and tmr at low bias voltage and close to the antiparallel configuration , one should consider two different time scales .",
    "one time scale , @xmath167 , is established by the virtual first - order processes responsible for the spin precession due to exchange field , @xmath168 the second time scale , @xmath169 , is associated with second - order processes which drive the current through the system . at low temperature and bias voltage ,",
    "the cotunneling rate can be expressed as @xmath170 the rate @xmath169 depends linearly on the applied voltage , whereas @xmath167 is rather independent of @xmath137 . as a consequence , at low bias and for non - collinear configuration , the exchange field plays an important role leading to a nonmonotonic dependence of differential conductance on the angle between the leads magnetizations .",
    "when magnetic configuration is close to the antiparallel one , the spin precession rate is deceased ( @xmath171 ) and , at certain angle , the rate of spin precession becomes comparable to the cotunneling rate .",
    "this gives rise to a sudden drop ( increase ) in differential conductance ( tmr ) , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:7]a(b ) .",
    "we note that the nonmonotonic dependence of differential conductance and magnetoresistance has also been observed in quantum dots in the strong coupled limit .",
    "@xcite     ( color online ) the @xmath150 ( a ) , @xmath156 ( b ) , and @xmath151 ( c ) components of the dot spin as a function of angle @xmath9 for several values of @xmath2 and for @xmath166 . the other parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . ]    as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : prec_rate ] ) and ( [ eq : cot_rate ] ) , in the low bias voltage regime the influence of the exchange field is mainly determined by the magnitude of departure from the symmetric anderson model , @xmath172 .",
    "the angular variation of the differential conductance and tmr for several values of the level position is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] . when raising the position of the dot level one goes from the symmetric to asymmetric anderson model , increasing the effect of exchange field , which is most visible for @xmath173 .",
    "the influence of exchange field is the same as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] discussed above .",
    "figure  [ fig:8 ] demonstrates that at a certain non - collinear magnetic configuration , by sweeping the gate voltage one can change the differential conductance and also tune the tmr between the positive and negative values .",
    "this can be of some importance for future applications in spintronics .    in the case of symmetric anderson model the dot spin is located in the plane defined by the magnetizations of the leads , i.e. in the @xmath113 plane . on the other hand , in the case of asymmetric anderson model , the exchange field gives rise to the spin precession in the dot , leading to a nonzero @xmath156 component of the dot spin .",
    "the components of the spin in the dot are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] for different position of the dot level .",
    "if we start from a symmetric anderson model , then the conductance and tmr are independent of the sign of the dot level shift ( shifting the dot level up or down by the same amount leads to equal conductance and tmr ) .",
    "the spin in the dot , however , depends on the sign of the shift .",
    "this is due to the fact that changing sign of the shift is associated with a sign change of the exchange field , which is proportional to @xmath174 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , the sign of the exchange field determines the sign of the spin components .",
    "it is also worth noting that the two components , @xmath150 and @xmath156 , disappear in both collinear configurations ( parallel and antiparallel ) . in turn",
    "the @xmath151 component vanishes only in the parallel configuration , while it remains nonzero in the antiparallel configuration due to spin accumulation .",
    "we have considered the cotunneling transport through a single - level quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads with non - collinearly aligned magnetic moments .",
    "transport properties have been calculated with the aid of the real - time diagrammatic technique which has been adapted to the case of deep coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the advantage of the real - time diagrammatic technique is that it takes into account the exchange field resulting from virtual processes between the dot and ferromagnetic leads in a fully systematic way .    in the case of symmetric anderson model",
    ", we have found a monotonic variation of the differential conductance and tmr with the angle between magnetic moments of the leads .",
    "this typical angular dependence is due to the fact that different contributions to the exchange field cancel each other and there is no spin precession of the dot spin  the dot spin remains in the plane defined by the magnetic moments of the leads .",
    "when the system is described by an asymmetric anderson model , the angular dependence of the differential conductance and tmr becomes more complex .",
    "first , the maximum and minimum values of differential conductance occur not for collinear configurations , but when the leads magnetizations are non - collinearly aligned .",
    "second , the conductance is enhanced in a broad range of the angle between the magnetic moments of the leads , and drops to the minimum value when the configuration becomes close to the antiparallel one .",
    "the conductance drop is particularly pronounced for small bias voltages .",
    "this behavior results from the interplay between the first - order processes giving rise to the exchange field and the second - order processes that drive the current .",
    "the exchange field also leads to a nonmonotonic angular dependence of tmr . for magnetic configurations where differential conductance is enhanced as compared to that in parallel configuration ,",
    "the tmr becomes negative .",
