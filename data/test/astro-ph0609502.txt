    "[ intro ]    damped lyman - alpha ( dla ) absorption systems , observed in spectra of quasars ( qsos ) , provide a powerful tracer of the chemical history of high redshift galaxies ( pettini _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) and represent a unique sample for studying the interstellar medium ( ism ) of distant galaxies .",
    "these systems contain mostly neutral gas , with neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath7 n@xmath10 @xmath11 20.3 , and thus provide an important link in our understanding of the star formation history of the universe .",
    "dlas remain the only class of galaxies at cosmologically significant redshifts with detailed measurements of element abundances .",
    "unfortunately , the dla host galaxies are faint and located at small projected distances from the qsos .",
    "the background qsos are much brighter than the dla and thus can contaminate the background at the position of the dla , making spectroscopic studies of the dla galaxies a challenging task .",
    "recent studies combining high angular resolution images and high snr spectra are providing key evidence revealing the nature of dlas .",
    "so far , most imaging studies of high - z and low - z dlas have failed to detect large luminous disks ( e.g. jimenez _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; kulkarni _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , 2001 ; chun _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 and references therein ) . the lack of substantial chemical evolution found in studies of element abundances in dlas ( e.g. kulkarni _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; proux _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 and references therein ) suggests that the currently known population of dlas seems to be dominated by metal - poor objects .",
    "thus dlas may consist of dwarf or low - surface brightness galaxies with modest star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "indeed , most emission - line imaging searches for dlas also indicate low sfr ( e.g. kulkarni _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "it is possible however that the metal - rich dlas are systematically underrepresented because of dust obscuration of background qsos ( e.g. fall & pei 1993 ; boisse _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .",
    "sfrs can be estimated with several different methods .",
    "emission line imaging provides a direct method to determine the sfr in low - z dlas , although it is subject to the possibility of dust extinction .",
    "an alternative method based on cii@xmath12 absorption lines has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "however this method is less direct , since it depends on several assumptions .",
    "furthermore , the cii@xmath12 method is not accessibble for low - z dlas , since the cii@xmath12 absorption lines fall in the uv .",
    "sfrs determined from optical emission lines have been extensively studied in nearby galaxies ( e.g. kennicutt 1998 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) and dlas ( chen _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; kulkarni _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the hydrogen recombination lines are directly related to the uv emission of the shortest - lived stars and thus measuring h@xmath0 in the optical wavelength range provides a good tool to estimate the sfr . assuming that the shape of the initial mass function is known , the main uncertainty in the measurement of optical emission line luminosities is extinction .",
    "however we can estimate the amount of extinction by measuring the balmer decrement ( e.g. pei 1992 ; cardelli _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) .",
    "so far , sfr estimates for most of the absorbers appear to be small : 63% of the detections and about 73% of the limits in the sample studied by @xcite show sfr @xmath13 5 m@xmath8 yr@xmath9 .",
    "this can be explained by one of the following possible cases : 1 ) the sfrs in dlas are in fact low ; 2 ) dust extinction is high preventing the line emission to escape from the hii region ; 3 ) the star - forming regions are too close to the qso line - of - sight masking the true sfrs . in order to distinguish the dominant effect ,",
    "more emission line imaging studies should be undertaken .",

    "the scale factor was set so that the count level at the position of the gap coincided with that of the background just outside the galaxy and qso emissions .",
    "larger scale factors than the one chosen would remove emission from the galaxy , while smaller ones would leave the qso flux dominating the galaxy spectrum .",
