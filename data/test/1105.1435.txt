    "many complex physical systems ( like - wise non - physical , e.g. economic @xcite ) can be satisfactorily described in terms of the dynamics of a certain fictitious particle under the action of random forces ( noise ) , originating from its environment . whenever we can identify a gaussian noise as an emergent property of the environment - particle coupling , the interrelated notions of ( thermal ) equilibrium , boltzmann asymptotic probability density functions ( pdfs ) and detailed balance generically follow .",
    "that is the case in the standard brownian motion picture , based upon kinetic theory derivations , in the presence of ( conservative ) external forces .",
    "however , in many stochastic systems the experimental data show that the description based on the introduction of the gaussian noise is insufficient , since the involved fluctuations turn out to generate have heavy - tailed distributions of lvy - stable type .",
    "those distributions are widespread , in a broad range of systems of varied levels of complexity : physical , chemical , biological @xcite , geophysical , economic @xcite .",
    "that is why a deeper understanding of properties of general complex systems with non - gaussian noises is extremely desirable .",
    "for example , contrary to the case of systems with gaussian fluctuations , in the context of lvy flights the notion of `` equilibrium '' , although natural under confining conditions , has no obvious thermal connotation , see however @xcite .",
    "it is clear that any conceivable `` thermal equilibrium '' concept for non - gaussian jump - type processes needs to be addressed with care and should account for a number of precautions .",
    "in particular , an issue of physically motivated thermalization mechanisms for ( confined ) lvy flights has received only a residual attention in the literature , @xcite and @xcite . the main obstacle here may be that the source of lvy noise is interpreted as extrinsic to the physical system under consideration , with no reliable kinetic theory background , i.e. with no identifiable microscopic channels of an energy exchange with the environment .",
    "lvy flights are pure jump ( jump - type ) processes .",
    "therefore , it seems useful to recall that various model realizations of standard jump processes ( jump size is bounded from below and above ) can be thermalized , by means of a locally defined scenario of an energy exchange with the thermostat , @xcite see also @xcite .",
    "it amounts to a suitable re - definition of transition rates for the jump process which enforces the _ principle of detailed balance _ to be respected by a random motion .",
    "we shall elaborate upon extension of this idea to lvy - stable processes , with a focus on the existence of asymptotic ( large time limit ) invariant pdfs , of the manifest boltzmann form .",
    "our approach is close to that used to analyze the lvy motion in systems with topological complexity like polymers ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , but remains distinctively different from a standard theory of confined lvy flights which is based on the langevin modeling .",
    "there is no known ( additive or multiplicative ) langevin representation for lvy processes respecting the canonical form of detailed balance .",
    "the considered class of confined lvy flights is well suited for the description of jump - type processes that are equilibrated ( eventually , to a thermal equilibrium state ) by a mild spatial disorder of the physical environment in which jumps take place .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the environment is quantified by turning over from the master equation to the affiliated semigroup dynamics .",
    "it is a suitable functional form of the semigroup potential ( which we consider to be a continuous function ) that allows for a unique asymptotic invariant state .",
    "that ensures the existence of an asymptotic invariant pdf for the master equation in question .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we discuss an issue of detailed balance for standard jump processes and next define its immediate generalization to lvy flights ( @xmath2-family of lvy - stable laws with @xmath3 ) , sections ii and iii .",
    "a mapping of the resultant master equation to a fractional version of the generalized diffusion equation follows in section iv . for clarity of presentation",
    ", we make a brownian detour in section v to indicate how the semigroup framework is related to the standard fokker - planck dynamics of diffusion - type processes . in section",
    "vi we describe the lvy @xmath1 - targeting under an assumption that target pdfs are selected from so - called cauchy @xmath4 - family of pdfs . for a computationally advantageous example of @xmath5 and arbitrary @xmath6 we provide analytic formulas for the associated semigroup potentials ( they define the semigroup dynamics which makes the considered pdfs to be genuine asymptotic targets of the jump - type process ) . in section",
    "vii the lvy targeting is considered for gaussian target pdfs .",

    "normalized solutions in the @xmath182-space for different @xmath1 s are reported in fig .",
    "[ f : normk ] .",
    "it is seen that for small @xmath182 and on the tails , the distribution functions for higher @xmath1 s run below those for smaller @xmath1 s , while in the intermediate @xmath182 range the situation is opposite .    the final step of the procedure is to invert the @xmath182-space solutions to the @xmath162-space and square them to obtain the desired terminal pdf . for general @xmath1 this procedure",
    "can be accomplished only numerically .",
    "[ f : xprvo ] displays both the inverted functions @xmath174 , corresponding to square roots of the inferred terminal pdfs ( panel ( a ) ) and those pdfs themselves ( panel ( b ) ) .",
    "the opposite ( if compared to this in the @xmath182-space ) tendency is seen in the @xmath162 space , where the curve corresponding to lowest @xmath1 lies below all other curves in the small @xmath162 region and has slowest decay .",
    "as @xmath1 grows , the central part of the curve rises and tails become steeper .",
    "panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ f : xprvo ] reports a comparison between the shapes of functions @xmath174 and @xmath208 .",
    "the situation here is the same as that for the airy function , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "namely , the function in @xmath182-space decays quicker then in @xmath162-space and its value at the center is larger then that in @xmath162 - space .",
    "we plot here the exemplary case of @xmath209 , the situation for other @xmath1 is qualitatively the same .",
    "the next natural step in our @xmath1-targeting procedure is to obtain ( numerically ) the dynamics of a function @xmath210 for lvy oscillators with different values of @xmath1 .",
    "this can be done both for the semigroup process and for the langevin - driven one ( e.g. fractional fokker - planck dynamics ) .",
    "those patterns of temporal behavior are inequivalent , although both processes may terminate at common pdfs with a predefined decay at infinities .",
    "the latter pdfs may have heavy tails , but generically admit an arbitrary ( finite , eventually infinite ) number of moments .",
    "a more general problem would be that of the existence of terminal pdfs , after passing from the master equation to the ( fractional ) hamiltonian dynamics with an arbitrary potential @xmath211 , in one , two or three spatial dimensions .",
    "we note that in the case of @xmath133 , when fractional hamiltonian reduces to ordinary quantum - mechanical hamiltonian operator . in the standard quantum mechanical setting ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) the above question is equivalent to an issue of the existence of bound states in a given potential .",
    "the quantum mechanical language appears because we can convert the parabolic equation of the fokker - planck type to the generalized schrdinger equation .",
    "the wave function of a bound state should be localized to ensure a normalization of its squared expression , i.e. the corresponding stationary pdf of the fokker - planck equation .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that in 1d case the bound state exist in the potential well @xmath36 of not only finite but an infinitesimal depth .",
    "the only restriction is that the integral @xmath212 should exist .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent to the requirement that @xmath36 should have the same asymptotics at infinities and potential zero point @xmath213 . in the 2d case , when the potential @xmath214 , the situation is similar to that in 1d one , while in 3d ( @xmath215 ) the situation is to some extent opposite - if the potential well is not sufficiently deep ( see ref.@xcite for details ) , the particle can not be `` captured '' , so that bound state does not exist . confining potentials in 3d , where bound states exist ,",
    "form the so - called kato class of potentials .",
    "the presence of fractional derivatives with @xmath3 alters the picture both in 1d ( 2d ) and in 3d . in 1d",
    "they definitely `` spoil '' the bound states .",
    "it is not only that the pdfs ( if in existence ) may have heavier tails if compared to the conventional ( @xmath127 ) case .",
    "the pdfs in question may not exist at all , if a normalizability of the bound state is lost . in 3d and in equations with fractional derivatives",
    "there may typically be no normalizable bound states ( and thus terminal pdfs ) , except for a carefully selected ( kato)-subclass of conceivable potentials .",
    "some peculiarities pertaining to the ( non)-existence of invariant pdfs in the case of lvy drivers ( langevin - driven fractional dynamics ) were discussed for 1d case in ref .",
    "we have encountered the same problem in connection with the cauchy family of pdfs @xcite , see also ref .",
