    "this limit must depend on the degree of mixing of helium and nickel , which may in turn depend on the detailed structure of the progenitor and the energy and asymmetry of the explosion .",

    "the reason for this difficulty is largely related to the dynamical adjustment of the stellar structure of wr stars with mass loss . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kipp1 ] as an example , the size of the helium - burning convective core in a wr star decreases as the wr star loses mass by winds ( fig .",

    "we therefore conclude that observations of early - time light curves and spectra will be an excellent probe into the nature of sn ib / c progenitors .      *",
    "a caveat in the above conclusions is that the predictions summarized in table  [ tab1 ] are mostly based on the models at solar metallicity .",

    "this value is within the ejecta mass range of ordinary sne ib / c by @xcite and @xcite , although it still can not explain sne ib / c having ejecta masses lower than about 3.5  @xmath4 . given that the final amounts of helium must also be smaller than in the case of solar metallicity ( fig .",

    "recent observations indicate very low helium mass ( @xmath113 ) in the ejecta @xcite .",

    "this conflict may be due to our lack of proper knowledge on the mass loss rate from helium stars ( in particular during the post - helium burning phase ; sect .",
    "[ sect : binaryhe ] ) but a rigorous estimate of helium masses for a large sample of sne ib / c is highly required to resolve this issue . the ratio of sn ic to sn ib is another important constraint for progenitor models , which should be better estimated in the future .",

    "* ) would greatly help to clarify the role of mass loss from helium stars in the evolution of sn ib / c progenitors .",
    "it would be particularly important to investigate how the ejecta masses of sne ib / c and the ratio of sn ib / sn ic rate systematically depend on metallicity . * in the discussions above , we did not address progenitors of broad - lined sne ic ( sne ic - bl ) , simply because we do not have a good clue on what makes them .",
    "the association of long grbs and some sne ic - bl  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies the importance of rapid rotation , and attempts have been made to explain long grbs , sne ic - bl and super - luminous sne ic within the single framework of the magnetar scenario  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "future studies should investigate more carefully the evolution of some specific binary systems where the condition of rapid rotation for magnetars can be rather easily fulfilled compared to the standard channels , such as binary systems consisting of a helium star plus a compact object in a very tight orbit  ( fig .",

    "<S> type ib / c supernovae ( sne ib / c ) mark the deaths of hydrogen - deficient massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutionary scenarios for sne ib / c progenitors involve many important physical processes including mass loss by winds and its metallicity dependence , stellar rotation , and binary interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this makes sne ib / c an excellent test bed for stellar evolution theory . </S>",
    "<S> we review the main results of evolutionary models for sn ib / c progenitors available in the literature and their confrontation with recent observations . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the nature of sn ib / c progenitors can be significantly different for single and binary systems , and that binary evolution models can explain the ejecta masses derived from sn ib / c light curves , the distribution of sn ib / c sites in their host galaxies , and the optical magnitudes of the tentative progenitor candidate of iptf13bvn . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the importance of early - time observations of light curves and spectra , accurate measurements of helium mass in sn ib / c ejecta , and systematic studies about the metallicity dependence of sn ib / c properties , to better constrain theories .    </S>",
