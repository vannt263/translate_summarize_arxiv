    "it is well known that in standard model ( sm ) the higgs quartic coupling has a landau pole for a sufficiently heavy higgs mass .",
    "the position of the pole is a function of the higgs boson mass . for light enough mass of the higgs boson , either landau pole is higher than the plank scale or it disappears , and the unitarity of sm is preserved .",
    "however very quickly as @xmath5 approaches @xmath6 the landau pole becomes close to the @xmath7 scale and as a consequence the perturbative unitarity is broken in longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitudes .",
    "this is known as unitarity bound on higgs boson mass @xcite , which relates the higgs mass to the energy scale at which the unitarity is broken in sm .",
    "this scale , as a function of @xmath5 represents a scale at which either some new particles should come in and save unitarity , or otherwise , the sm becomes strongly coupled .",
    "note that in this paper we refer to unitarity of sm in the presence of the higgs boson , not to be confused with analysis of longitudinal gauge boson scattering in the absence of higgs boson , in which case unitarity is violated at much lower scales .    in the standard analysis of unitarity bound on higgs mass for sm the equivalence theorem@xcite",
    "is used to relate the longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitude to the corresponding scalar scattering , including unphysical goldstone boson modes in the @xmath8 gauge . at tree level and high energies",
    "these amplitudes are purely @xmath9waves , proportional to higgs self - coupling @xmath10 .",
    "naive analysis of loop contributions of su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge bosons to say @xmath11 amplitude seems to give very small result , because couplings @xmath12 are small .",
    "however such amplitudes contain sudakov double logarithms@xcite-@xcite , and in a series of recent papers @xcite@xmath13@xcite it was shown how in the effective theory approach one can resum these large logarithms .",
    "the results of @xcite@xmath13@xcite are that at the @xmath7 scale such sudakov resummation leads to decrease in the cross section for processes like @xmath14 up to @xmath15 , a suppression factor that rapidly increases with the center of mass energy . in a recent paper @xcite",
    "it was shown that electroweak sudakov corrections play a significant role in top quark forward backward asymmetry .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to go beyond the traditional tree level unitarity analysis of sm and study how higher order corrections , which are part of sm and can be calculated using existing techniques , modify the unitarity bound of sm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ seq : theo ] we briefly review the approach developed in @xcite@xmath13@xcite to resum electroweak logarithms for high - energy processes . in section [ seq : ww ]",
    "we derive the effect of electroweak large logarithm resummation on the high energy behavior of longitudinal gauge bosons and higgs scattering amplitudes .",

    "soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite@xmath13@xcite is an effective theory for highly energetic quarks and gluons .",
    "recently it has been extended in @xcite@xmath13@xcite to standard model to compute renormalization group improved amplitudes for sm including resummation of sudakov large double - logarithms from loops with su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge bosons .",
    "the computation can be divided in three steps .",
    "first we integrate out the hard modes at the scale of center of mass energy @xmath16 for our scattering process . for @xmath17 process",
    "we match on four - particle contact operators in eft , which is referred to as @xmath18 with massless su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge bosons .",
    "this leaves us with some basis of operators and wilson coefficients , which only contain @xmath19 and can be minimized by scale choice @xmath16 .",
    "next the effective operators in @xmath18 have to be evolved down to the weak scale @xmath20 . in order to relate the wilson coefficients at low scale to the ones obtained by matching on previous step at high scale one needs to exponentiate the anomalous dimension matrix , which consists from collinear and soft parts .",
    "this anomalous dimension has been studied and calculated to one loop order for any process in sm in @xcite@xmath13@xcite . finally at the low scale @xmath21 one has to match onto broken theory where gauge bosons have been removed . as a result one gets the effective amplitude for scattering of gauge bosons and quarks and leptons with resummed large logarithms .",
    "the corresponding amplitude in @xmath18 gets the following factorized form@xcite : @xmath22 \\,p\\exp\\left(\\int_{\\mu_h}^{\\mu_l}\\frac{d\\mu}{\\mu}{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}(\\alpha(\\mu))\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\,\\,\\,\\times{\\boldsymbol{c}}\\left(\\alpha(\\mu_h),\\left\\{\\ln\\frac{p_i{\\!\\cdot\\!}p_j}{\\mu_h^2}\\right\\}\\right),\\label{mresummaster}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the column vector of wilson coefficients obtained from matching at high scale , @xmath24 is the anomalous dimension of effective operator , which is a matrix in the color space , and finally @xmath25 appears as a result of the low scale matching .",
    "the anomalous dimension for a general hard scattering process has the form @xmath26 , where collinear anomalous dimension is a sum of collinear anomalous dimensions associated with each leg and soft anomalous dimension has a non - trivial color structure but is universal in the sense that it only depends on light - cone directions and color flow .",
    "we derive in this section electroweak radiative correction contribution to the amplitude of longitudinal gauge and/or higgs boson scattering amplitude . the corresponding formalism has been developed in @xcite@xmath13@xcite and was briefly reviewed in section [ seq : theo ] .",
    "following these references we use the equivalence theorem to relate gauge boson amplitude to the corresponding unphysical scalar amplitude in @xmath8 gauge .",
    "this method was applied in refs .",
    "@xcite@xmath13@xcite to derive longitudinal gauge boson production at lhc to next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic order(nnll ) , except for scalar contribution at two loops that is missing for some parts .",
    "we work at next - to - leading logarithmic order ( nll ) .      at the scale @xmath27",
    "we integrate out hard modes and leave only collinear modes , corresponding to four external label momenta . for our purpose",
    "the higgs quartic coupling gives the biggest contribution to the matching .",
    "we neglect the gauge boson mediated interactions between the scalars , since they are suppressed by the ratio of weak coupling to higgs self - coupling @xmath28 . the tree level matching is given by higgs quartic term in the sm lagrangian , and is trivial : @xmath29 the higgs quartic coupling has a familiar landau pole at higher energies , and is given at one loop order : @xmath30 while @xmath31 .",
    "equation eq .   is valid approximation for @xmath32 . for lower masses",
    "one has to include contribution of top quark yukawa coupling and the landau pole disappears . we come back to this case at the end of section [ seq : unitarity ] .      from high scale",
    "the wilson coefficients must be evolved to the low scale @xmath34 which is of the order of the electroweak scale @xmath35 .",
    "this is achieved by calculating the anomalous dimension of the four particle operator in the effective theory @xmath18@xcite .",
    "the anomalous dimension for such process can be written as sum of process dependent collinear anomalous dimension , which is simply the sum over the corresponding terms for each leg , and the universal soft anomalous dimension @xcite , which only depends on kinematics and color structure , but is same for say scalars or fermions .",
    "thus the collinear part of anomalous dimension we know from @xcite@xmath13@xcite and the soft part of the anomalous dimension is same as in @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 . for @xmath39 the soft anomalous dimension to one loop",

    "this calculation in sm is tricky and has been performed consistently in ref .",
    "the result is that the scalar doublet has to be matched on physical states below @xmath34 , which are @xmath95 and each component of the doublet gets different matching correction which can be found in @xcite for general case @xmath96 . for nll order and setting @xmath97",

    "to get numerical results one has to plug in @xmath131 and scale variation can be used as usual as an estimate of theoretical uncertainties .    also note that the ll result for the amplitude has no angular dependence ,",
    "the scattering remains @xmath9wave similarly to tree level result .",
    "the non - trivial angular dependence appears only at nll order .",

    "thus in @xmath9 wave analysis , the amplitude @xmath134 including electroweak sudakov logarithms at nll order vanishes .",
    "same is true at tree level : amplitude @xmath134 _ only vanishes in _ @xmath9wave and @xmath135 and @xmath136 _ vanish identically_@xcite .      in this subsection we will use the general @xmath116 matrix derived in the previous subsection at nll order to numerically study the nll order electroweak sudakov logarithms in @xmath138 cross section . this process does not provide the tightest bound for traditional unitarity bound analysis of standard model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we provide this as an illustration to the effect of electroweak logarithms for longitudinal gauge boson scattering cross sections .",
    "as was found in the previous subsection at ll order all other processes are proportional to each other , i.e. to the one considered in this subsection , the only non - trivial difference appears at nll order .    since at ll @xmath9wave analysis is exact , at nll order we expect it to be a good approximation .",

    "the right plot in figure [ fig : numerics1 ] represents the full nll su(2)xu(1 ) sudakov corrections for each function @xmath143 .",
    "it turns out that to this order there are only two non - trivial functions : @xmath144 and @xmath145 as shown in that figure .",
    "the reason @xmath144 has been explained at the end of previous subsection . by the same argument",
    "it is clear that @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "numerically it so happens that they all are the same at this order , which could be explained if one completely ignores the angular dependence in @xmath126 .",
    "the horizontal axis for @xmath148 goes all the way to the planck scale . as expected at low energies the sudakov corrections",
    "are small , however very quickly they reduce amplitude at tree level by a factor of @xmath149 at the cm energy @xmath150 .",
    "having studied the generic behavior of scattering amplitudes of longitudinal gauge bosons ( and higgs ) , we specialize to the case of @xmath151 : @xmath152 where function @xmath153 we calculate by two methods .",
    "first is exact , keeping the full angular dependence in the amplitude , coming from nll order ( see eq .  ):",
    "@xmath154 in the second method we use @xmath9wave approximation : @xmath155 both functions are plotted in the left part of figure [ fig : numerics2 ] . it is comforting to see , that there is a good agreement between the exact and @xmath9wave approximated cross sections , since at leading logarithmic order the entire amplitude is a pure @xmath9wave . while it is interesting that the electroweak corrections reduce the @xmath156 scattering cross section so dramatically at high energies , @xmath157 at the cm energy of @xmath158 , one should keep in mind that depending on the higgs mass @xmath5 , the quartic coupling @xmath159 has a landau pole and extending predictions beyond that scale is meaningless . as an illustration , on the right part of figure [ fig : numerics2 ] we include the higgs coupling and plot the function @xmath160 for different higgs masses . as expected",
    "the cross section blows up at the landau pole , which is unaffected by sudakov corrections .",
    "however for lighter higgs masses ( @xmath161 ) , almost everywhere except the vicinity of the landau pole , the cross section is significantly suppressed due to sudakov double logarithms .",

    "we reproduce correctly the tree level result@xcite : @xmath171.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the tightest bound for unitarity analysis is given by eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to largest eigenvalue .",
    "the eigenvalues in the units of @xmath172 are @xmath173 .",
    "the largest eigenvalue corresponds to eigenchannel @xmath174 .",
    "however in @xcite this state is not used for unitarity bound , since for heavy enough higgs mass the scale @xmath175 where unitarity of sm breaks becomes close to higgs mass , thus the state under consideration is kinematically not allowed .",
    "instead in @xcite the isospin zero state @xmath176 is used and the unitarity bound is a factor of @xmath177 weaker for this state however the problem mentioned above is absent .",
    "now our goal is to re - derive the scale where sm unitarity is broken by extending it from tree level , to including the sudakov double logarithms that we have calculated in section [ seq : ww ] for arbitrary longitudinal gauge or higgs boson scattering to nll order . since we found that at ll , there is a simple multiplicative factor for @xmath116 matrix ( see eq .  )",
    "we can simply make the same choice of the state @xmath176 as in @xcite as our candidate to give the best unitarity bound .",
    "this is not true at nll , but corrections should be small . also it is an apple - to - apple comparison to @xcite , where the tree level amplitude and one - loop higgs quartic running have been included into analysis .",
    "we limit ourself to unitarity bound @xmath178 as in @xcite , although at very high energies as we will see below the imaginary parts and higher harmonics start to play role due to nll effects .    in order to understand the role of higher harmonics @xmath179 which appear due to nll order sudakov double logarithms , as well as the imaginary parts of scattering partial waves , we plotted in figure [ fig : numerics3 ] the real and imaginary parts of first three harmonics : @xmath180 as function of @xmath148 specifically for the @xmath176 channel , which is a simple exercise given eq .   and",

    "we use one - loop beta function for quartic coupling including only self coupling contribution to the beta function , which is a good approximation for heavier higgs masses . the green curve in figure [ fig : numerics4 ]",
    "represents the unitarity bound found in @xcite , i.e. requiring @xmath183 and including higgs quartic coupling one loop running .",
    "including electroweak logarithms into the formula for the amplitude we get the dashed blue curve ( ll ) and solid blue curve ( nll ) .",
    "finally , let us address the role of electroweak logarithms and unitarity scales for the case of light higgs mass which is favorable from current lhc bounds .",
    "simple formula in eq .",
    "considered above is not applicable in this case . in ref.@xcite beta functions of all couplings of sm",
    "are computed to two - loop order .",
    "for simplicity we only use their results constraining ourselves to one - loop , including running of couplings of sm : @xmath184 and ignoring remaining yukawa couplings . note the different normalization(factor of 2 ) between @xcite and us for @xmath28 , and @xmath185 in @xcite",
    "is same as @xmath186 , while @xmath187 are same as our @xmath188 and @xmath189 and @xmath190 . as a result",
    "we get the left plot in figure [ fig : numerics5 ] for higgs masses @xmath191 .",
    "as one can see the qualitative behavior is very much different than for heavy higgs masses . instead of landau pole , we get a fixed point at high energies as well as the change in the sign of the quartic coupling at an energy scale that depends on the mass of the higgs boson . similar behavior of quartic coupling was found for higgs mass around @xmath192 in ref.@xcite , which used state - of - the art analysis , including full two - loop running of all couplings .    as a result for light higgs masses shown in the left part of figure [ fig : numerics5 ]",
    "we see that the coupling remains perturbative to planck scale .",
    "furthermore , as one can see from the red plot in the right part of figure [ fig : numerics5 ] , the tree level @xmath9wave partial amplitude for unitarity constraining scattering of the state @xmath176 is within the unitary limit @xmath193 for all center of mass energies all the way to the planck scale . the electroweak logarithms modify this amplitude by reducing it significantly at high energies .",

    "we have computed to next - to - leading logarithmic order the effect of electroweak sudakov logarithms for any longitudinal gauge or higgs boson scattering amplitude . at",
    "leading - logarithmic order the amplitude gets multiplied by a universal function @xmath196 , independent of the concrete process and with strong dependence on energy .",
    "for example , the high energy behavior of the function @xmath112 for @xmath197reduces the tree level cross section suppressed by a factor ranging from @xmath198 at @xmath199 to @xmath200 at @xmath201 .",
    "this correction does not depend ( at our order ) on higgs mass .",
    "of course the entire approach becomes intractable for energies above the landau pole of the quartic coupling @xmath28 .",
    "this kind of behavior at high energies affects the unitarity bound of sm . despite the sudakov suppression ,",
    "when energy gets close to quartic landau pole , the singularity still wins in the very vicinity of the pole and the unitarity is still broken .    for heavier higgs masses , the landau pole appears very close to the higgs mass , so the electroweak logarithms do not get a chance to contribute significantly , since at those scales the logarithms are small . in this limit",
    "the unitarity bound is unaffected .",
    "however for lighter higgs masses , ( but still @xmath202)when the landau pole gets further and further from the electroweak scale , the electroweak corrections play a dramatic role for the high energy behavior of the longitudinal gauge boson scattering , by pushing the scale where the unitarity of sm is broken very close to the landau pole energy scale , thus restoring unitarity except in the immediate vicinity of the pole .",
    "this qualitative picture can be easily seen in figure [ fig : numerics4 ] .",
    "finally for very light higgs mass around @xmath203 , which is currently phenomenologically favorable , the quartic coupling remains perturbative at all scales and preserves unitarity at all scales , both at tree level and when electroweak logarithms are included , which suppress amplitude and cross section of longitudinal gauge boson scattering significantly at high energies .",
    "this can be seen from figure [ fig : numerics5 ] .",
