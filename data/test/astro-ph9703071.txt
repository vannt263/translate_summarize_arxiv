    "the study of statistical associations between foreground galaxies and background agns has a long and controversial history .",
    "gravitational lensing seems to provide the best explanation for this phenomenon ( see schneider et al 1992 , narayan and bartelmann 1996 , schneider 1996 for recent reviews of both theoretical and observational aspects ) .",
    "the density of a population of flux - limited background sources ( e.g. agns ) , magnified by a factor @xmath5 by a mass perturbation is changed in two ways .",
    "as the angular dimensions of the lensed zone are expanded by a factor @xmath5 , the physical size of a region observed through a fixed angular aperture will be smaller than in the absence of the lens .",
    "this causes a decrease in the agn surface density equal to @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "the lens will magnify faint sources ( which would not have been detected otherwise ) into the sample and increase the number of detected agn .",
    "if the slope of the agn number - counts cumulative distribution is steep enough , the latter effect would dominate over the former and there would be a net excess of agn behind the lens",
    ". the value of the density enhancement @xmath7 of these sources around foreground galaxies would be @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the effective slope of the background source cumulative number counts ( borgeest et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "observations show that there seems to be positive correlations between foreground galaxies and high@xmath4 radio - loud quasar samples ( hintzen et al .",
    "1991 , bartelmann & schneider 1994 , bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1995 , etc . ) , or heterogeneous samples which contain a considerable fraction of radio - loud quasars ( tyson 1986 , thomas et al .",
    "the results for radio - quiet qsos are confuse and often even contradictory .",
    "although at small scales there are both positive and negative results ( see narayan 1992 ) , at large scales there are no detections of radio - quiet qso - foreground galaxy positive correlations but evidences of anticorrelations ( boyle et al .",
    "1988 , bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1997 ) .",
    "this last fact can not be explained in terms of gravitational lensing alone : although stronger correlations are predicted for radio - loud samples due to the existence of a double magnification bias effect ( borgeest et al .",
    "1991 ) , the correlations should also be observed for radio - quiet qso samples .",
    "these results , however , may be understood if we consider small amounts of dust associated with the lensing masses ( bentez & martnez - gonzlez 1997 ) , a phenomenon which may be called dirty or dusty lensing . in that case , and taking into account the double magnification bias , for a radio - loud sample the density enhancement @xmath10 would be @xmath11 , whereas for the radio - quiet sample @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the cumulative number - counts slope in the optical ( @xmath15 ) and the radio bands ( @xmath16 ) respectively and @xmath17 is the optical depth by dust present in the lensing matter .",
    "we have assumed that the absorption is much larger in the optical than in radio , and that the radio flux is approximately independent from the optical magnitude .",
    "then , if e.g. @xmath18 , we have that @xmath19 , independently of the number - counts slope in the optical @xmath13 , and @xmath20 for the radio - quiet qsos .",
    "it is thus specially interesting to determine if the associations with foreground galaxies also occur for other radio - loud agn samples which have very different optical properties from the quasars , as the radiogalaxies . in bentez",
    "et al . 1995",
    "( b95 ) , an excess of apparently foreground galaxies was found around a sample of 5 radiogalaxies with @xmath21 . in this paper",
    "we extend our study to a larger sample ( 21 radiogalaxies ) , and perform it in the @xmath3 band .",
    "this band is a good tracer of old stellar populations and makes easier the identification of foreground mass concentrations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we report the observation and data reduction procedures . in sec .",
    "3 we describe the results and the statistics . sec .",
    "4 discusses our main results and conclusions .",
    "our preliminary sample was formed by all the radiogalaxies from the 3c catalogue with @xmath22 .",
    "we observed 17 sources from this catalogue picking them in function of the availability of their coordinates and completed the final sample with four radiogalaxies with similar characteristics obtained from the literature : 0956 + 475 , 1129 + 35 , 1141 + 354 and 1230 + 349 .",
    "as far as we know there is no bias whatsoever towards the presence of low redshift objects around our sample .",
    "the observations were carried out at the caha 2.2 m telescope at calar alto with the camera magic on the nights of 1995 january 16 - 19 and may 16 - 17 .",
    "magic uses a @xmath23 nicmos3 hgcdte detector array . for the purposes of our investigation it is essential to have a wide field in order to determine accurately the background density , so we used the configuration which provided the largest pixel scale , @xmath24 arcsec / pixel , which gives a @xmath25 arcmin@xmath26 field .",
    "we typically took 27 exposures of 60 sec . for each field .",
    "the telescope was nodded among nine positions forming a 20 arcsec square grid .",
    "both in the january and may runs the weather ranged from bad to awful , and some of the exposures had to be rejected due to clouds .",
    "the images have been reduced in the standard way for near ir observations . a first pass reduction involved forming a flat field for each frame by median combining the closest frames with a sigma - clipping algorithm . after identifying the most extended and saturated objects , we eliminated them from the raw frames and repeated the procedure .",
    "the final , averaged @xmath3 images were trimmed and only contain the intersection zone which was observed in all the exposures .",
    "the median p.s.f . was @xmath27 arcsec .",
    "although the nights were not photometric , the way in which the analysis has been performed ensures that our main results are insensitive to photometric uncertainties .",
    "the package sextractor ( bertin and arnouts 1996 ) was used for image detection and classification .",
    "we accurately determined the p.s.f .",
    "of each field running the routine sexseeing several times until it converged to a stable value and then performed the detection after smoothing the frame with a gaussian close to the p.s.f",
    ". value .",
    "the star - galaxy classification algorithm correctly identifies the brightest , saturated stars . at fainter magnitudes , with our pixel scale it is virtually impossible to distinguish between stars and galaxies . in any case",
    ", any star entering our sample would just tend to dilute any possible excess and lower the significance of our results .",
    "so we form our galaxy sample by taking all the objects to which sextractor assigns a stellar index smaller than 0.9 , which excludes the more conspicuous bright stars .",
    "we have checked that the final results are insensitive to variations in the stellar index threshold .",
    "we set the completeness limit at the magnitude at which the detected galaxies typically have a photometric error of @xmath28 .",
    "this usually corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "the radiogalaxy has been detected in 11 of the fields , but there are several instances in which either it is fainter than the completion limit ( 5 ) or the presence of a bright object close to its position makes impossible either identification or photometry ( 5 ) . when needed we have established its location in the frame with an accuracy of @xmath30 arcsec with the help of reference charts from the digital sky survey , and obtained its magnitude from the literature or estimated it with the @xmath31 relationship ( mccarthy 1993 and references therein )    the distribution of truncated or incomplete objects in the fields shows that there is a 10 pixel wide zone where sextractor loses bright objects because they are too close to the border of the detector .",
    "we have excluded this region from our catalogues and also a 10 pixel radius circle around the radiogalaxy to avoid merged objects .",
    "the useful surface thus defined contains 1944 galaxies and covers a surface of 645.4 arcmin @xmath26 .",
    "to check for the presence of associations due to the magnification bias effect , we have to select a foreground galaxy catalogue and try to avoid the inclusion of any galaxies clustering with the radiogalaxy at its same redshift .",
    "we can make use of the fact that the high@xmath4 3c radiogalaxies are representative of some of the brightest known early type galaxies , so they are very likely to be more luminous than any other object at the same redshift , and redder than almost any foreground galaxy .",
    "therefore , any object which is significantly brighter in @xmath3 than the radiogalaxy is almost certainly in the foreground .",

    "+    we employ a statistical method similar to the one discussed and applied in b95 .",
    "the number of galaxies found in a central region around the radiogalaxies @xmath33 is compared with the expectation @xmath34 determined from the average density on the whole superfield ( including the central region ) . to compare with previous results for radiogalaxies ( b95 ) ,",
    "a 1 radius circle was chosen . in fig .",
    "1 we have plotted histograms for @xmath33 ( continuous line ) and @xmath34 ( dashed line ) binned in @xmath51 mag intervals of @xmath32 , the difference between each galaxy magnitude and the magnitude of the radiogalaxy in its field . an excess of galaxies is clearly seen in the magnitude bins which are brighter than the radiogalaxies . in table 1",
    "we have listed @xmath33 and @xmath34 for galaxies brighter than a given threshold in @xmath32 . in order to have enough galaxies for our statistical analysis we take the objects which have @xmath52 , which is enough to ensure that the objects are brighter than the radiogalaxies .",
    "we find 55 galaxies within the central 1 region which are at least 1 mag brighter than the corresponding radiogalaxy , against an expectation of 34.34 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the density enhancement would be even stronger if we set a brighter threshold ( @xmath54 for @xmath55 ; @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) but the significance levels would be lower due to the smaller total number of galaxies in the samples .    how significant is this result ?",
    "if we placed @xmath58 points at random within a field of surface @xmath59 , the number of points @xmath60 found within a central region of fixed surface @xmath61 would be binomially distributed with average @xmath62 and variance @xmath63 , where @xmath64 . in our case @xmath65 , which gives a @xmath66 difference with respect to poisson that would vanish in the limit when @xmath61 is much smaller than @xmath59 .    if the results of 21 different independent fields were added up together , the resulting distribution would be approximately gaussian with an average @xmath67 and a variance @xmath68 .",
    "we expect that the variance for a real galaxy field @xmath69 will be larger than that of a random distribution @xmath70 because of galaxy clustering ( peebles 1980 ) : @xmath71 baugh et al .",
    "1996 have measured an amplitude @xmath72 for the correlation function @xmath73 of @xmath74 galaxies .",
    "as it is well known , the correlation function approximately scales with depth as @xmath75 , where @xmath76mpc ( peebles , 1980 ) .",
    "thus the amplitude will change with the limiting magnitude as @xmath77 . after calculating the integral of the correlation function with a monte carlo taking into account the shape of our region we found that the total dispersion combining the 21 separate fields would be : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the amplitude of the correlation function corresponding to each field .",
    "thus the expected variance in the number of galaxies within the central region should be @xmath80 .",
    "if we measure empirically the rms from our data we obtain a lower value , @xmath81 , very close to the expectation for a random galaxy distribution . however , this empirical estimation is rather uncertain , because our total surface is only @xmath82 times larger than the central region , and thus the amount of independent data is very limited . for this reason ,",
    "we take as a conservative estimate of the true dispersion the theoretical upper limit , @xmath83 , which yields a significance of at least @xmath84 , equivalent to a @xmath85 significance level .    incidentally ,",
    "if we consider the four fields which are common to our sample and to b95 , namely 0956 + 475 , 3c256 , 3c294 and 3c324 ( 1217 + 36 was excluded from the present sample because it was found to be stellar - like in b95 ) , we found 12 foreground galaxies in the central region against an expectation of 7.26 , a @xmath86 excess close to the obtained for the full sample .    to further check the above mentioned results",
    ", we have measured the central density of objects which are _ fainter _ than our foreground sample .",
    "the sample thus defined contains 1587 galaxies .",
    "no excess is detected : there are 152 galaxies in the central box against an expectation of 153.3 .",
    "there are few deliberate searches for magnification bias effects around high@xmath4 radiogalaxies in the literature . besides",
    ", the comparison of our results with other works is complicated by the fact that as far as we know , this is the first such analysis done in the near ir .",
    "our present result clearly confirms the excess found in b95 .",
    "however , a bootstrap analysis shows that subsamples of 4 fields chosen randomly from our sample yield overdensities ranging from @xmath87 ( @xmath88 confidence limits ) . if the average density enhancement @xmath7 were slightly lower , which could be the case for other galaxy or agn samples , values of @xmath89",
    "could have been obtained in a non - negligible number of cases .",
    "this should be taken into account when working with very small samples , as in fried 1996 .",
    "hammer and le fevre ( 1990 ) claim that there are nine times more high@xmath4 3cr galaxies within five arcsec of @xmath90 galaxies than expected from a random distribution .",
    "although we can not check the excess at those scales because of our pixel scale , our results confirm that samples as the 3cr radio sources may be considerably affected by gravitational lensing .    in a recent paper ,",
    "roettgering et al .",
    "( 1996 ) do not find any excess of bright galaxies @xmath91 around a sample of 11 ultra - steep - spectrum radio galaxies with @xmath92 .",
    "however , the scale of their field is smaller than ours , @xmath93 .",
    "the number of foreground galaxies found within @xmath94 of our radiogalaxies is 129 .",
    "thus , the expectation within the central @xmath95 would be @xmath96 ( the rms has been estimated as above ) .",
    "we found 55 , that is a @xmath97 overdensity with a @xmath98 significance level .",
    "for a sample of 11 galaxies the significance would have been just @xmath99 , against the almost @xmath100 that we obtain in our larger fields . in any case , this comparison is not very conclusive , as far as neither the filter , nor the radiogalaxy type or redshift distribution are the same .",
    "we have determined the existence of an statistical excess of foreground galaxies around a sample of background , high redshift radiosources .",
    "the way in which the foreground sample galaxies have been selected almost excludes the possibility of their being physically associated with the radiogalaxies .",
    "the only consistent explanation  at least qualitatively  for this fact is the magnification bias caused by gravitational lensing by the dark matter perturbations traced by the foreground objects .",
    "the small size of the sample precludes a detailed , quantitative study of the form of the radiogalaxy - galaxy correlation function",
    ". it would be therefore desirable to use larger , well understood radiogalaxy samples with accurately defined properties to obtain a robust estimate of @xmath7 which could be compared with theoretical estimations .",
