    "this is an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the reverse problem , where the eigenvalues are known but the operator is not , is also of interest .",
    "this is the `` inverse scattering problem '' @xcite ( also see _ e.g. _",
    "indeed it is the basis of the famous question : `` can one hear the shape of a drum ? ''",
    "in other words , can the frequencies ( eigenvalues ) of the sound emitted from the drum be used to determine the shape ( operator ) of the drum ? in the quantum mechanics context , the equivalent problem is of reconstructing the schrodinger potential , @xmath1 , from the energy spectrum .",
    "such inverse scattering problems are of interest in a wide variety of applications",
    ".    we will be interested in a class of problems where @xmath2 itself originates from some field interactions .",
    "our aim is not just to reconstruct the schrodinger potential , @xmath2 , but the underlying _ field theory _ interactions that led to that particular schrodinger potential .",
    "the eigenvalue data that we will use to reconstruct the field theory is the excitation spectra of any topological defects that might be present in the system .",
    "the method is widely applicable since topological defects are present in a large class of systems .",
    "they are routinely observed in condensed matter systems , and are inevitable in high energy particle physics models .",
    "topological defects relevant for high energy particle physics are also relevant for the very early universe .",
    "hence the excitation spectra of these topological defects can be a window to the early universe , and in particular , to inflationary cosmology .",
    "a way to understand the usefulness of topological defects in a reconstruction effort is that the core of a topological defect contains a different phase of the theory and so the core holds non - perturbative information about the field theory .",
    "therefore the excitation spectrum of the defect leads to a global reconstruction of the field theory .",
    "this is in contrast to a _",
    "local _ reconstruction that is possible by perturbative methods such as particle scattering .    in",
    "what follows , we assume that we are given a topological defect .",
    "in fact , for actual calculations , we will exclusively work with kinks in 1 + 1 dimensions since this example illustrates the central ideas and also because there are extensive techniques in 1 + 1 dimensions that are not available in higher dimensions .",

    "our scheme yields the sine - gordon field theory when there is only one bound state ( the translation mode ) on the kink .",

    "we assume that we know the spectrum of energy eigenvalues , @xmath3 , for the bound states on a topological defect . for the time being , we will only focus on the bound states . the price we pay",
    "is that there is then a huge degeneracy in the reconstruction . by using scattering information and further physical input",
    "it may be possible to eliminate the degeneracy but we shall not be discussing this issue here .",
    "the general reconstruction scheme is as follows .    * prior to an analysis , a theoretical framework is needed and the appropriate field content should be known . in this discussion we will only consider a single scalar field @xmath4 in one dimension , with standard form of the lagrangian : @xmath5 * the schrodinger equation that determines the excitation spectrum is : @xmath6 \\psi_n = \\omega_n^2 \\psi_n \\label{schrodinger}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the ( unknown ) profile function of the defect  the classical defect solution .",
    "we would like to determine the potential @xmath1 .",
    "inverse scattering methods have been developed precisely to solve this problem .",
    "the answer , however , is not unique , especially if only bound state spectra are taken into account .",
    "however , additional theoretical input can possibly reduce degeneracies . for example , if some interactions are known by perturbative methods , the information might be useful to break some of the degeneracy may also be reconstructed using scattering data _",
    "i.e. _ not just the eigenvalues but the scattering amplitudes .",

    "the scheme employs the idea of supersymmetric quantum mechanics where the hamiltonian operator can be factored , and yields a _ reflectionless _ potential with the desired bound state spectrum .",
    "we now summarize the scheme ; a sketch of how the scheme is derived is given in appendix  [ appendixa ] .",
    "while it may seem that the reconstruction in terms of supersymmetric potentials is overly restrictive , we show in appendix  [ appendixb ] that kinks in one spatial dimension always lead to a supersymmetric form of the potential @xmath1 .",
    "we also show that this is can be true even when we have multi - component fields in more than one dimension .",

    "the solution to the @xmath35 schrodinger equation : @xmath36 \\psi_n = \\omega_n^2 \\psi_n \\label{nthorder}\\ ] ] is simply : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a normalization constant to be determined by other considerations . in particular , since @xmath20 is the smallest eigenvalue , the corresponding eigenfunction must be the translation mode of the defect that does not affect the energy .",
    "therefore @xmath39 and the translation mode is known once we know @xmath40 : @xmath41 where we have dropped the subscript on @xmath42 .",

    "a partial explanation is to be found in section [ appendixb ] , where we show that whenever @xmath1 arises from a field theoretic kink , it must necessarily be of the supersymmetric form ( eq .  ( [ uneqn ] ) ) .",

    "the reconstruction can be continued to the case of three of more bound states .",

    "such methods have not yet been developed .",
    "the inverse scattering technique that we have used only works in one spatial dimension .",
    "problems in more than one spatial dimension require other inverse scattering techniques .",

    "if there was an extended but limited period of superluminal expansion in the early universe , light scalar fields would get excited by the spacetime expansion and create adiabatic perturbations on superhorizon scales .",
    "the prediction of adiabatic perturbations matches observations of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and is the reason for the current confidence in the cosmic `` inflationary '' scenario .",
    "the mechanism driving cosmic inflation is a scalar field called the `` inflaton '' .",
    "the dynamics of both the spacetime and the scalar field is dominated by the inflaton potential energy for the entire duration of cosmic inflation . under certain assumptions ,",
    "this requires the scalar field to lie on top of a very flat potential . with time",
    "the scalar field slowly rolls along the flat potential , eventually reaching the steeper parts of the potential where its kinetic energy becomes significant .",
    "then inflation stops and the subsequent evolution of the scalar field leads to `` reheating '' _ i.e. _ conversion of scalar field kinetic energy into ordinary matter in a thermal state .",
    "one hopes that the scalar fields necessary for cosmic inflation will automatically arise in high energy particle physics models , such as grand unified theories ( guts ) or string theory . on very general grounds",
    ", it is known that such theories contain magnetic monopoles and sometimes other topological defects .",
    "if inflation and the defect are due to separate fields , the study of the defect core can not yield information about inflation .",
    "for the global reconstruction scheme under discussion to work , the inflaton itself should play a role in the structure of the topological defect .",
    "one of the cosmological problems that inflation was designed to solve was the magnetic monopole overabundance problem that arose out of the marriage of guts and cosmology .",
    "if there is a period of inflation during or after the gut phase transition , the magnetic monopole density would get diluted to insignificant amounts , leaving perhaps only a few in the entire visible universe .",
    "however , subsequent work on inflation has shown that topological defects can still be produced in significant numbers toward the late stages @xcite .",
    "if bound states on one of these defects can be studied , it would help in the global reconstruction of the inflaton potential .",
    "the other possibility of using the reconstruction scheme is if future particle physics experiments are able to produce magnetic monopole and antimonopole pairs ( or closed walls or strings ) in the laboratory .",
    "the excitations of these monopoles could then be studied .",
    "there is also the possibility that duality holds in particle physics and the known particles ( _ e.g. _ the electron ) may be dualized magnetic monopoles @xcite .",
    "the internal excitations of the electron , would then be excitations of a magnetic monopole .",
    "perhaps these excitations can tell us something about inflation .    earlier work on reconstructing the inflaton potential ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) worked under the assumption that the cmbr anisotropies are generated by quantum fluctuations of the inflaton .",
    "this results in a _",
    "local _ reconstruction of the potential , the limited range of scales observed being explained entirely by a very small portion of the entire inflaton potential . here",
    "we will consider signatures of _ global _ features of the inflaton potential , such as flatness .    before we proceed to discuss signatures of inflaton potentials in the excitation spectrum ,",
    "it is worth noting that inflation can occur within topological defects , so - called `` topological inflation '' @xcite .",
    "we will , however , not consider this possibility since , if a defect inflates , it is not possible to find it or create it within our horizon while retaining predictability @xcite .",

    "in fact , eq .  ( [ phi0tophat ] ) can be used to find the translation mode @xmath59 for the top hat case : @xmath123 since the translation mode is the lowest energy bound state ",
    "an eigenstate with lower eigenvalue would signal an instability of the defect  all bound states have positive energy and lie above the top of the double well structure in the transition regions .",
    "so we expect the higher bound states to be relatively insensitive to the details of the transition region and mimicking @xmath1 by a finite square well potential may be a reasonable way to start a first analysis .",
    "the finite square well potential is analyzed in virtually every quantum mechanics textbook ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",

    "as is well - known @xcite , a special property of the infinite square well potential is that its eigenvalue spectrum is proportional to @xmath136 where @xmath137 is an integer that labels the eigenstates starting with the ground state .",
    "the same property holds for the low lying eigenstates of the finite square well .",
    "if the potential is shaped like @xmath138 , then it can be shown that @xmath139 ( see appendix  [ appendixc ] ) .",

    "the width of the well is much larger than the distance over which the sides of the well get to their asymptotic levels .",
    "therefore , the sides of the well are very steep ( @xmath141 ) in relation to the width of the wall and so the bound state spectrum @xmath142 should be proportional to @xmath143 .",
    "qualitatively similar arguments may be used in the three dimensional case , in the case when the bound state spectrum on a monopole is known . if the potential , @xmath144 , is spherically symmetric , the density of energy eigenstates with fixed total angular momentum can once again lead to information about the flatness of the inflaton potential .",

    ", we have applied the recipe to the case of one and two bound states on kinks . in the one bound state case ,",
    "the recipe yields the sine - gordon potential and in the two bound state case with a specific set of eigenvalues we obtained the @xmath0 potential .    while implementing the recipe we have relied on the inverse scattering method based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the method yields reflectionless potentials @xmath1 .",
    "other inverse scattering methods may also be used and , in general , they will lead to different @xmath1 with the same bound state spectra .",
    "the non - uniqueness of the reconstruction may be reduced by further inclusion of scattering data and perhaps by using other system - specific information .",
    "our recipe for the reconstruction of @xmath16 is sufficiently involved that , except in the simplest situations , it will have to be implemented numerically .",
    "for example , even in the two bound state case , the solutions of the differential equations in the inverse scattering problem are given in terms of hypergeometric functions , making it very hard to analytically implement the recipe .",
    "the reconstruction in 3 + 1 dimensions is technically even more challenging .",
    "however , we can expect the analysis to be close to the 1 + 1 dimensional case when the problem is spherically symmetric .",
    "the results of this paper are relevant to any system in which topological defects occur .",
    "hence we can expect applications to condensed matter systems , particle physics , and cosmology .",
    "it would be interesting to try out the reconstruction in condensed matter systems where topological defects are readily available .",
    "( or in nuclear physics to the extent that nuclei can be modeled by skyrmions @xcite . )",
    "the reconstruction would yield a landau - ginzburg type of effective interaction potential but would not yield , at least directly , information about the microphysical interactions between the fermions .",
    "the application to particle physics and cosmology is futuristic since topological defects are theoretically expected in these settings but have not yet been experimentally discovered or observed .",
    "just as in the condensed matter case , the scalar field need not be fundamental even in the particle physics context .",

    "the spectrum of bound states in these defects will reflect the properties of the inflationary potential . reversing the argument",
    ", since we know that the inflationary potential must have certain properties , the bound state spectrum must also have some characteristics .",
    "we have discussed these characteristics as a way to probe the inflationary scenario , which is hard to do otherwise @xcite .",
    "if future investigations discover a scalar field with an extremely flat potential , that scalar field will be a prime suspect to be the inflaton , and the defect with its characteristic bound state spectrum will be a `` smoking gun '' from the shot that was fired ten billion years ago .",
    "if the topology of the inflaton vacuum manifold is trivial , no defects will exist and the reconstruction scheme discussed here will not be useful for inflationary cosmology . if , however , inflaton topological defects do exist , experiments may become feasible in the future that can directly probe cosmology in the laboratory .",

    "here we give a check of the iterative scheme for the inverse scattering method described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "suppose we are given a potential @xmath151 that contains @xmath26 of the highest bound states .",
    "then we construct the functions @xmath152 from the equation : @xmath153 this non - linear equation is simplified by setting @xmath154 using which we get the linear equation @xmath155 finally we construct @xmath156 the claim is that @xmath30 has an eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath142 in addition to all the other higher eigenstates .    that @xmath30 admits a state with eigenvalue @xmath142 ,",
    "can be shown explicitly .",
    "the state is given by : @xmath157 then it easy to check that @xmath158 so , indeed , the potential @xmath30 has an ( explicitly constructed ) eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath142 .    for the iterative procedure to work ,",
    "we also need to show that @xmath30 admits eigenstates with the higher eigenvalues @xmath159 for @xmath160 .",
    "this is seen as follows .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath25 are `` partner '' potentials . in other words , we can write the @xmath35 hamiltonian as : @xmath161 where @xmath162 then , the partner hamiltonian is : @xmath163 it is now easy to show that if @xmath164 satisfies @xmath165 then @xmath166 is an eigenstate of @xmath167 with the same eigenvalue : @xmath168 thus , @xmath169 and @xmath167 have a common eigenspectrum , except for the lowest state of @xmath169 that satisfies @xmath170 .",
    "hence @xmath171 has states with eigenvalues @xmath172 , @xmath160 since these are also the eigenvalues of states in @xmath25 , and then it has one extra eigenstate and this has eigenvalue @xmath142 .",
    "here we show all that all kink potentials ( @xmath2 ) have the supersymmetric form . we know that every kink has a translation mode which does not change the energy .",
    "therefore , the schrodinger equation ( eq . ( ( [ schrodinger ] ) ) gives @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the translation mode .",
    "this form of @xmath1 can be rewritten as : @xmath175 where @xmath176'$ ] , and hence @xmath2 is of the supersymmetric form ( eq .  ( [ uneqn ] ) )",
    "@xcite .",
    "this argument can also be extended to higher dimensions with derivatives replaced by higher dimensional derivatives .",
    "then we find : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is a vector valued function and @xmath179 is a translation mode .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath180 where @xmath181    if @xmath164 is a multi - component scalar field , or a collection of several scalar and gauge field fluctuations , in several dimensions , there are circumstances in which @xmath2 is still supersymmetric .",
    "label the many components of @xmath164 by the index @xmath182 .",
    "so @xmath164 may be thought of as a column vector with components @xmath183 .",
    "now in higher dimensions , there will be several zero modes .",
    "for example , translations along any dimension will be a zero mode .",
    "so label the zero modes by the index @xmath184 and denote the translation modes by @xmath185 .",
    "then consider the matrix @xmath186 whose components are @xmath187 .",
    "we can show that @xmath2 is supersymmetric if we assume that @xmath186 is a square matrix that is invertible .",
    "this follows because now : @xmath188 { \\bf m } = 0 \\label{schrodm}\\ ] ] ( @xmath2 itself is a matrix potential . )",
    "then it is easy to show that @xmath189 where @xmath190",
    "we now find the connection between the shape of the potential and the dependence of the @xmath35 eigenvalue , @xmath191 , on @xmath21 for the specific class of potentials : @xmath192 where @xmath184 and @xmath140 are parameters .",
    "we use the wkb approximation @xcite . the quantization condition for a particle of mass @xmath193 in the potential @xmath1 is @xmath194 where @xmath191 stands for @xmath142 in the notation of sec .",
    "[ generalscheme ] . inserting the class of potentials in eq .",
    "( [ genu ] ) , we find : @xmath195      now , @xmath196 @xmath197 denotes the infinite square well potential of width @xmath198 ( see fig .  [ appfig ] ) .",
    "our assumption is that the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the @xmath199 term and that the @xmath200 term can be ignored .",

    "for reasonably large @xmath191 we can expect it to hold , though @xmath191 should still be much smaller than @xmath122  the asymptotic value of @xmath2  so that the finite depth of the well does not play a role ."
