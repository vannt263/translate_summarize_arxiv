    "tremendous experimental progress has been made in the last few years in the real - time measurement of mesoscopic systems .",
    "the development of parametric amplifiers with very low noise  @xcite has allowed single qubits to be observed in real - time  @xcite , culminating recently in the first realizations of continuous - time feedback control of a single mesoscopic qubit  @xcite .",
    "considerable experimental progress is also being made in the feedback control of microscopic systems  @xcite .",
    "it is timely therefore to reflect on the state of the theory of continuous - time measurement - based control of simple quantum systems  @xcite . while progress has been made in understanding the dynamics induced by continuous measurements , and its implications for feedback control  @xcite , except in certain special cases  @xcite it is still unknown how to use feedback to best control a single qubit . a feedback protocol involves continuously measuring an observable of the qubit , and modifying the hamiltonian of the qubit with time . specifically , the `` protocol '' is the rule by which we choose the observable to measure , and the hamiltonian , at each time as a function of the state of the system ( the density matrix ) .",
    "the problem of finding a superior feedback protocol is not in choosing the hamiltonian at each time : although as yet unproven , so long as there is no restriction on what observable can be measured , and the noise is not unusually asymmetric , it is obvious that the optimal hamiltonian is the one that moves the state closest to the desired state at each timestep .",
    "when the only restriction on the hamiltonian is the speed that it can rotate on the bloch sphere , this is achieved by following a geodesic on this sphere .",
    "it is the problem of how to chose the observable to measure as a function of the current state of the qubit that has no obvious answer .",
    "by contrast to open - loop control , the problem of finding optimal feedback protocols is very difficult to solve numerically .",
    "to do so one must solve the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation  @xcite , which involves optimizing at the final infinitesimal time - step , and then stepping back , one time - step at a time , optimizing at each time until we reach the initial time .",
    "the size of the search space is the number of timesteps used to discretize time , multiplied by the number of grid points used to discretize the space of control options for each possible state at each time .",
    "the density matrix for a single qubit has three real parameters , and the measurement has three real parameters , so the space of control options at each time - step is 6-dimensional .",
    "the resulting numerical optimization problem is daunting .",
    "here we address the problem of finding a feedback protocol that is optimal in the steady - state .",
    "we do not concern ourselves especially with the optimality of the protocol in the initial , transient regime .",
    "we also specialize our analysis in two ways , both of which will simplify the problem to some extent .",
    "the first is that we restrict our attention to the regime of good control .",
    "this regime is defined as that in which the control forces are sufficient to keep the system close to the desired state , @xmath0 , during the relevant time interval  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , `` close '' means that the probability of finding the system in a state orthogonal to @xmath0 is much less than unity .",
    "since we are interested here in optimality only in the steady - state , we also require that the protocol is in the regime of good control only in the steady - state .",
    "the initial state of the system may be anything .",
    "our second specialization is that we restrict our analysis to markovian noise processes that are symmetric about the @xmath1-axis of the qubit .",
    "this is a broad class of processes .",
    "in fact , all the commonly considered noise processes have this symmetry : dephasing , decay , thermalization , and depolarizing  @xcite .",
    "this symmetry provides an initial simplification , especially when the state in which we wish to place the qubit  the target state  is also symmetric about the @xmath1-axis ( is an eigenstate of @xmath1 ) .",
    "if the target state is @xmath2 or @xmath3 , then one parameter is eliminated from the density matrix , reducing the number of parameters to five .",
    "we will find that in the regime of good control , the above symmetry allows a further reduction to four parameters .",
    "our method is to show that by focussing on the regime of good control , and analyzing the dynamics under measurement , one can make a number of well - motivated conjectures about the form the optimal protocol should take . assuming these conjectures to be true leaves only a single parameter of the measurement basis to be chosen as a function of a single parameter of the state .",
    "the resulting optimization problem can be tackled readily with numerical simulations . performing this optimization",
    "we find that the numerical results are sufficiently simple that the resulting protocol , can be specified analytically .",
    "this is the first example of a nontrivial protocol for the general control of a qubit under finite control speed , and we conjecture that it is optimal in the regime of good control .",
    "in section  [ setup ] we present the description of the qubit , the hamiltonian , and the continuous measurement , as well as defining the regime of good control in terms of our description . in section  [ args ]",
    "we present the arguments that suggest a form for the optimal feedback protocol . in section  [ nums ]",
    "we perform the numerical optimization , and present our candidate optimal feedback protocol . in section  [ disc ]",
    "we finish by providing some intuitive arguments as to why our candidate protocol has the form it does , in terms of known properties of continuous measurements .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , feedback control involves making a continuous measurement of an observable of the qubit , and modifying the hamiltonian of the qubit with time .",
    "since all observables for a single qubit can be written as a sum of the three pauli operators , we can denote the measured observable by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a real three - dimensional unit vector , and @xmath6 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the density matrix of the qubit can be written in terms of the three - dimensional bloch vector , @xmath7 as @xmath8 since our control problem is symmetry about the @xmath1-axis the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions are equivalent , and we can eliminate the @xmath10 direction . we can then write the density matrix in terms of the length of the bloch vector , @xmath11 , and the angle between it and the ground state , which we will denote by @xmath12 . with these definitions",
    "the density matrix is given by @xmath13 .",
    "\\label{rhoxz}\\ ] ] the evolution of the density matrix under the measurement is given by the stochastic master equation ( sme )  @xcite , @xmath14dt   -k [ \\sigma_{\\mathbf{m}},[\\sigma_{\\mathbf{m}},\\rho]]dt \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\ ; \\sqrt{2k}(\\sigma_{\\mathbf{m}}\\rho + \\rho\\sigma_{\\mathbf{m } } -2\\braket{\\sigma_{\\mathbf{m}}}\\rho)dw , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;    \\label{eqqnofb } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , referred to as the _ measurement strength _ , determines the rate at which the measurement extracts information , and @xmath16 is an increment of wiener noise  @xcite .",
    "the continuous stream of measurement results , @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 it is important to note that since the measured observable , @xmath19 , can have a @xmath10 component , it will not leave the density matrix in the form given in eq.([rhoxz ] ) .",
    "it must therefore be understood that after each time step @xmath20 , a rotation about the @xmath1-axis is applied ( under which our control problem is invariant ) to reduce @xmath21 to zero , and thus keep @xmath22 in the @xmath23-plane .",
    "all hamiltonians for a single qubit can be parametrized by a single direction around which they rotate the cubit , and a size parameter giving the speed of this rotation .",
    "we can write general hamiltonian as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the real , unit norm , three - dimensional vector that gives the axis of ration , and @xmath26 gives the angular speed of rotation .",
    "we choose as our target state the ground state , @xmath2 , for which the bloch vector is @xmath27 .",
    "since the density matrix lies in the @xmath23-plane , the hamiltonian that rotates the qubit closest to the target state in a time step @xmath20 , for a given value of @xmath26 , is @xmath28 \\hbar ( \\mu/2 ) \\sigma_y .",
    "\\label{fbham1}\\ ] ]    _ bounds on the control speed _ : the natural constraints that we place on the speed of the controls are i ) a bound on the speed of the hamiltonian , and ii ) a bound on the rate at which the measurement can extract information .",
    "these bounds are @xmath29 for some positive constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we allow the controller to measure in any basis , and apply a hamiltonian that rotates in any direction .    _",
    "control objective : _ the objective of the control is to maximize the probability , @xmath32 , that the qubit will be found in the target state , @xmath2 , in the steady - state . the regime of good control is defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the error probability . in this regime",
    "we can write the error probability as @xmath35 were we have defined @xmath36 . in the regime of good control , the qubit spends most of its time in states for which @xmath12 and @xmath37 are small parameters .",
    "we will assume our qubit is driven by thermal noise , for which the master equation is  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "here @xmath40 is the lowering operator , @xmath41 is the damping rate , and @xmath42 is determined by the temperature and the energy gap between the ground and excited states of the qubit .",
    "the excited - state population at thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath43 .",
    "thermal noise includes decay as a special case ( @xmath44 ) , and as noted above , the arguments we employ below apply also to dephasing and depolarizing noise .",
    "we now present a number of arguments , each of which suggest that we can eliminate one or more parameters from the control problem , while exactly or approximately preserving the optimality of the protocol . eliminating these parameters",
    "greatly simplifies the control problem .",
    "the first argument is that , since we can measure in any basis and apply any hamiltonian , it is reasonable to expect that we are always in a better position for the purposes of future control when the bloch vector is closer to the state @xmath2 , given that its length is fixed . while intuitively obvious , this statement has not been rigorously proved , to authors knowledge .",
    "nevertheless this suggests that we should choose the hamiltonian at each time - step to rotate the state towards the target at the maximum possible speed , since this achieves the closest state to the target at the end of the time - step , over all choices of the hamiltonian .",
    "this means setting @xmath45 , and choosing the hamiltonian as given in eq.([fbham1 ] ) .",
    "the second argument is that , since we can measure in any basis , it is always best to measure at the maximum strength .",
    "the reason for this is that we can always choose to measure in the eigenbasis of the density matrix , a measurement that is effectively classical . as such it reduces the entropy of the system without introducing any quantum back action , and as such does not change the direction of the bloch vector .",
    "since our goal is to achieve a state that is as pure as possible , this choice of measurement produces a benefit without any detriment to the future control .",
    "this argument suggests that we can set @xmath46 and still maintain optimality , leaving us only with the basis of the measurement undecided .",
    "the third argument concerns the basis of the measurement .",
    "the question is whether we can restrict ourselves to measurements that keep the bloch vector in the @xmath23-plane , or whether we should include measurements of observables that include a component of @xmath47 . while motion in the @xmath10 direction is irrelevant for the purposes of our control protocol , measurements with strength @xmath31 that include a component of @xmath47 will have a different effect on @xmath12 and @xmath48 than those that do not , and the dynamics of these variables is relevant .",
    "we now note that we are most interested in the regime of good control , in which @xmath31 and @xmath30 are large enough that the feedback protocol can keep @xmath49 , and thus @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for small @xmath12",
    "the difference between a measurement along @xmath52 and one along @xmath47 is second order in @xmath12 .",
    "thus in the regime of good control , making a measurement with a component of @xmath47 can only have a minor effect on the performance .",
    "we can therefore restrict ourselves to measuring observables of the form @xmath53 and so are described by a single angle @xmath54 . if @xmath55 then the measurement is `` aligned '' with the state , and thus is in the eigenbasis of the density matrix . in this case",
    "the measurement causes no diffusion in @xmath12 .",
    "-plane at an angle @xmath12 to the @xmath1-axis , and the solid curve is the surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "the measurement basis is at an angle @xmath54 with respect to the @xmath1-axis , and the ground state @xmath56 is at the bottom of the sphere .",
    "the measurement causes diffusion in @xmath12 if @xmath57 . ]",
    "the forth and final argument is that in the regime of good control the measurement basis , defined by @xmath54 , need not depend upon the length of the bloch vector , @xmath48 .",
    "this insight comes from examining the equations of motion for @xmath48 and @xmath12 from a measurement at the angle @xmath54 .",
    "the simplest way to derive these equations is to have the bloch vector point directly upwards , so that @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "since we can always chose the bloch vector as our axis of quantization if we wish , this case provides all the information we need about the dynamics .",
    "we write @xmath22 in terms of the bloch vector , and substitute this in eq.([eqqnofb ] ) to derive the equations of motion for @xmath60 and @xmath61 . from these",
    "we use ito s rule to obtain the equations of motion for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which are @xmath64 when @xmath48 is close to unity , the regime of good control , we can expand these equations as a power series in @xmath65 . keeping terms up to first order in @xmath37 we have @xmath66 we can now easily generalize these equations for @xmath67 if we wish , which is achieved by the replacement @xmath68 .",
    "from these equations we see immediately that the leading order terms in the motion of @xmath12 are of order unity , and it is only the next - to - leading - order terms that depend on @xmath37 , since @xmath69 .",
    "the length of the bloch vector therefore has little effect on the dynamics , and thus the control , of @xmath12 in the regime of good control . examining the equation of motion for @xmath48 we see that to leading order the deterministic part of this equation ( the term multiplying @xmath20 ) is also independent of @xmath37 , and thus @xmath48 , but this is not true of the stochastic part ( the term multiplying @xmath16 ) .",
    "the fact that the stochastic part is proportional to @xmath37 is precisely the diffusion gradient induced by the measurement , and by which the measurement increases the length of the bloch vector ( makes the state more pure ) .",
    "the important fact for our purposes is that as far as this diffusion gradient is concerned , making @xmath54 dependent on @xmath37 has the same action as changing the measurement strength . on physical grounds",
    "it is apparent that modulating the measurement strength ( that is , reducing it below its maximal value ) , is not useful as it can not increase the rate at which the measurement purifies the state .",
    "a more quantitative argument is as follows .",
    "if we choose @xmath54 as a function of @xmath37 , so that the stochastic term is proportional to a higher power of @xmath37 , then we will reduce the diffusion gradient , thus effectively reducing measurement strength .",
    "this argument does not apply for powers of @xmath37 that are less than unity , but numerical simulations show that if we replace @xmath37 with @xmath70 , the rate of purification is reduced  .    with the above simplifications",
    "the state @xmath22 is defined by two parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath12 , and the feedback protocol is completely specified by a function @xmath71 that tells us how to chose the measurement angle based on the location of the bloch vector . finding the optimal @xmath72 is a task that is feasible on a parallel computer .",
    "we depict the geometry of the control protocol in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "once we have reduced a quantum control problem to a set of differential equations that tell us how the controls effect the dynamics of the system ( for example , eqs.([eq::dtheta ] ) and ( [ eq::da ] ) ) then the difference between classical and quantum control is merely in what kind of dynamics arises . in classical control",
    "is it not usual for the measurement to effect the noise that drives the system , and this is the primary difference . for completeness , if we include the feedback hamiltonian that always rotates the state towards the target , then the equations that define our control problem ( having used the first three of the above simplifications ) are @xmath73 ) \\left(3 -   \\frac{2}{a^2 } \\right ) dt + \\sqrt{8k } \\sin(\\alpha-\\theta ) \\left ( \\frac{1}{a } \\right ) dw   \\label{eq::dtheta } \\\\",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this control problem the control parameters @xmath54 and @xmath15 change the noise driving the system as well as the deterministic motion , and the result is a complex nonlinear problem .",
    "in fact , the distinction between classical and quantum control contains a further subtlety that is worth elucidating . since eqs.([eq::dtheta ] ) and ( [ eq::da ] ) describe the evolution of the density matrix , which is the observer s full state of knowledge about the system , these equations are the equivalent of classical equations of motion for a probability density in phase space that gives the observer s state of knowledge about the classical system .",
    "the wiener noise driving the equations is therefore not the noise driving the system that we wish to minimize , but noise that tells us the random change in our state of knowledge due to the stream of measurement results .",
    "this noise necessarily depends on the measurement , and does so also in the classical equation of motion for the probability density .",
    "the real difference between quantum and classical is that , since the classical measurement does not disturb the system , there is a dynamical model underlying the classical probability density in which the system is driven by noise , and controlled by the feedback forces , and this dynamics is not affected by the measurement .",
    "this means that the optimization of the measurement and that of the controls can often be separated . while the controls can affect how much information the measurement obtains ( because this information may depend on the state of the system ) the controls can usually be optimized without reference to the measurement . in the quantum case ,",
    "if it is even possible to construct an underlying model then the noise driving the system does depend on the measurement .",
    "thus in the control problem given by eqs.([eq::dtheta ] ) and ( [ eq::da ] ) we must consider the measurement parameters @xmath54 and @xmath15 as a integral part of the optimization of the control protocol .",
    "to find the function @xmath71 via numerical optimization we must discretize it .",
    "the fact that @xmath12 is small suggests that @xmath72 may be well - approximated by the first few terms of a power series .",
    "we set @xmath74 and perform a gradient search using the bfgs quasi - newton method  @xcite to find the values of @xmath75 that minimize @xmath76 . for these simulations we measure time in units of @xmath15 ( that is , we set @xmath77 ) and use @xmath78 and @xmath79 , so that we are in the regime of good control .",

    "note that the steady - state is given by averaging over the many trajectories , corresponding to the many possible streams of measurement results .",
    "in any given trajectory the state of the qubit continues to evolve under the feedback .",

    "this can be understood from the following property of measurement : the average rate at which the measurement purifies the state ( that is , lengthens the bloch vector ) , is greatest when the diffusion is greatest .",
    "when the feedback hamiltonian is sufficiently fast ( @xmath141 ) it can suppress the unwanted diffusion and thus take advantage of the increased purification . that this would be true for sufficiently strong feedback",
    "was already known  @xcite  what is unexpected is that the optimal value of @xmath82 switches abruptly from @xmath117 to @xmath118 at a given value of @xmath142 .    to summarize , we have obtained a feedback control protocol for a single qubit that gives a nontrivial prescription for choosing the measurement angle as a function of the direction of the bloch vector and the feedback strength .",
    "we conjecture that this protocol is optimal ( to first - order in @xmath12 ) in the regime of good control .",
    "time will hopefully tell if this conjecture is correct .",
