    "galaxy characteristics , like morphology and star - formation rate ( sfr ) , are observed to change with environment where high density regions like clusters are characterized by a larger fraction of elliptical galaxies and a lower star - formation rate than seen in the field @xcite .",
    "these observations are known as the morphology - density and sfr - density relations , although whitmore et al .",
    "( 1991,1993 ) argue that these reflect a tighter and more fundamental morphology - radius relation where the distance from the cluster centre is the independent parameter .",
    "the morphology - density relation shows distinct behavior over three separate regimes which can be characterized in terms of the projected galaxy density or the radial distance from the cluster centre ( in terms of the virial radius , @xmath1 , defined by the @xcite as @xmath2 mpc ) . in the lowest density regions farthest from cluster centres ( with projected densities @xmath3 or radius @xmath4 ) the relation is flat , suggesting that the physical mechanisms responsible for changes in morphology are not effective in this regime .",
    "at a characteristic radius of @xmath5 ( projected densities of @xmath6 ) the fraction of intermediate type ( s0 ) galaxies begins to increase while the late - type disk ( sc ) galaxy fraction decreases and the sfr decreases sharply @xcite .",
    "these trends continue till @xmath7 ( projected density @xmath8 ) where the fraction of intermediate types decreases and the elliptical fraction dramatically increases @xcite . the behavior of these relations over the separate regimes indicates a change in the dominant physical mechanisms influencing the evolution of galaxies across these environments .",
    "there are a variety of physical mechanisms that could be responsible for altering galaxy morphology in dense environments , including ram pressure stripping , tidal interactions , galaxy harassment , strangulation , and major and minor mergers .",
    "the vast majority of galaxies in the universe reside in groups which are small dynamical systems typically containing a handful of large ( @xmath9 ) galaxies and a large number of smaller galaxies .",
    "these systems have velocity dispersions between @xmath10 and intragroup medium ( igm ) densities that are not well constrained .",
    "thus , it has been thought that tidal interactions are likely to dominate in this environment while ram pressure stripping and strangulation are less likely to be important .",
    "galaxy groups , according to the hierarchical scenario of the formation of large - scale structure , are the building blocks of rich clusters of galaxies . since most galaxies exist in groups these are important sites in which to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed morphology and sfr - density relations .",
    "two important questions arise :    * to what extent are field galaxies and intergalactic gas preprocessed by the group environment before they are incorporated into galaxy clusters ? * which physical mechanisms are important in altering the morphology and sfr of galaxies in the group environment ?    here",
    "we present observations of the ngc 4065 group , located in the coma supercluster .",
    "this group is a unique laboratory for studying ram pressure stripping as we have two independent means of measuring the density of the intergalactic gas in this system which also contains an deficient , edge - on , sc galaxy ( ugc 07049 ) .",
    "this group has an average velocity of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , a velocity dispersion of @xmath13 , and extended x - ray emission from the intragroup medium @xcite .",

    "the ngc 4065 group was observed with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at 610 mhz in the standard continuum observing mode in august of 2007 for 8 hours including calibration .",
    "both the upper and lower sidebands of the correlator were used with 16 mhz bandwidth in each . here",
    "we present only upper sideband data .",
    "the group was observed in hi 21 cm line using the gmrt in may of 2008 . at @xmath18 mhz ,",
    "the system temperature and the gain ( k / jy ) of the instrument are 76k and 0.22 respectively . the observations were carried out in the indian polar mode .",
    "the baseband bandwidth used was 16 mhz , giving a velocity resolution of 27 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the on source integration time was 15 hours .",
    "the pointing centre for the hi observations was @xmath20 in j2000 co - ordinates .",
    "the radio data were reduced using aips ( astronomical image processing system ) using standard procedures .",
    "bad data due to dead antennas and radio frequency interference ( rfi ) were flagged and the data were calibrated for amplitude and phase using the primary and secondary calibrators .",
    "the primary calibrator was also used as the bandpass calibrator .",
    "the 20 cm radio continuum maps were made using the self calibrated line free channels of the observations .",
    "the radio continuum was then subtracted from the data using the aips tasks uvsub and uvlin .",
    "the final 3-dimensional deconvolved hi data cubes were then obtained from the continuum subtracted data using the task imagr . from these cubes the total hi images and the hi velocity fields were extracted using the task momnt .",
    "a short archival _ xmm - newton _ observation of the environment of radio source ngc4061 ( observation i d 0112271101 , carried out on 2003 june 30th ) was used to study the x - ray emission from the intragroup medium .",

    "the dataset was affected by background flares , so filtering for good time intervals was applied to ensure that accurate measurements could be made in low surface - brightness regions .",
    "lightcurves in the 10  12 kev ( mos ) or 12  14 kev ( pn ) energy bands were used to identify time periods of high background rate , and thresholds of 0.4 cts s@xmath19 ( mos ) and 0.7 cts s@xmath19 ( pn ) were applied .",
    "the exposure times remaining after gti filtering were 5677 s , 6032 s and 3335 s for the mos1 , mos2 and pn cameras , respectively .",
    "spectral and spatial analysis were carried out using the filtered _ xmm - newton _ events lists .",

    "a background profile was first obtained by extracting a profile matched to the source profile from the weighted background file .",
    "the difference in background level between source and background profiles in the outer regions ( where source emission should be negligible ) was used as a second background component to subtract off the soft x - ray background from galactic and cosmic x - ray components . for spectral analysis an equivalent process",
    "was used : spectra were obtained from the source and appropriate background events lists for both target and local background extraction regions .",
    "the galactic / cosmic x - ray background contribution was modeled by fitting an x - ray background model to the local background spectrum consisting of two _ mekal _ models to account for emission from the galactic bubble and a power - law model absorbed by the galactic @xmath23 in the direction of the target to account for the cosmic x - ray background .",

    "we extracted spectra for the group emission from an annular region of inner radius 2 arcmin ( to exclude any agn - related x - ray emission ) and outer radius 6.7 arcmin .",

    "surface brightness profiles were extracted from the mos1 and pn events lists , which showed evidence for both an inner galaxy - scale halo and a flatter , group - scale component . a single @xmath31-model fit to the profiles was therefore a poor fit .",
    "we fitted the profiles with the projected double - beta model as described in @xcite , which is the surface brightness profile corresponding to a gas density profile of : @xmath32\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the relative normalization of the two @xmath31 model component . before fitting , each model was convolved with the _ xmm - newton _ psf based on the on - axis parameterization described in the _ xmm - newton _ ccf files xrt1_xpsf_0006.ccf , xrt2_xpsf_0007.ccf and xrt3_xpsf_0007.ccf .",
    "the markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method for exploring the 6-dimensional parameter space for this model described in @xcite was used to determined the best fitting model parameters for the gas density profile , with the joint @xmath34 value for the three profiles as the likelihood estimator .",
    "plausible ranges for each parameter were estimated by carrying out extreme fits and these were used as priors for the mcmc method .",
    "quantities derived from the surface brightness model fits , including x - ray luminosity and pressure at a given radius , are obtained by determining that quantity for each model fit and then obtaining the bayesian estimate for the quantity in question .",

    "we rely on the redshift survey of this group performed by @xcite which finds 74 members with an average velocity of @xmath11 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath43 .",
    "the group has two compact subgroups , uzg - cg 156 ( including ngc 4076 ) and uzc - cg 157 ( including ngc 4061 ) , which were identified by the 3d updated zwicky catalog @xcite solely on the criterion of compactness .",
    "these two subgroups are not distinguishable by velocity .",
    "however , there does appear to be an extended tail in the distribution toward lower velocities .",
    "the galaxies in this extended tail are clustered on the sky near uzc - cg 156 and may represent a filament toward nearby ( @xmath44 away ) rich cluster abell 1367 whose velocity is @xmath45 .",
    "if we assume that the extended tail is not significantly dynamically associated with the ngc 4065 group , and we remove those velocities from the sample , then the velocity dispersion becomes @xmath46 .",
    "the errors on this velocity dispersion are determined by generating bootstrap samples .",
    "the lack of simple gaussianity in the distribution of velocities and the strong spatial bimodality in the diffuse x - ray emission indicates that the system is not in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "if we assume the that group potential is deepest at the peak of the velocity histogram then the x - ray gas of this peak is located at a velocity of @xmath47 .",
    "the velocity of ngc 4065 ( @xmath48 ) , the early - type galaxy immediately east of radio galaxy ngc 4061 , puts it likely outside of the core of the group despite its projected appearance .",
    "the velocity of bent - double radio galaxy , ngc 4061 , as measured by @xcite is @xmath49 .",
    "previous radial velocity measurements have given this source a velocity of @xmath50 @xcite and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we follow the method for using bent - double radio sources as probes of intergalactic gas outlined in @xcite with a few additional caveats .",
    "we are assuming that the jet bulk flows have decelerated to non - relativistic speeds on kilo - parsec scales , and certainly by the time they are bent by the motion of the host galaxy ( @xmath52 kpc from the core of the radio galaxy ) .",
    "this assumption is borne out by the symmetric fluxes in the two jets ( see figure [ fig : lgt6800 ] ) , were they still relativistic then beaming effects would produce asymmetric fluxes which would be easily observable in these data .",
    "we also consider additional pressure in the jets from entrained material .",
    "bent - double radio sources can be used to measure the density of intergalactic gas by the application of euler s equation @xcite .",
    "the time - independent euler equation describes the balance of internal and external pressure gradients ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the external ram pressure felt by the radio galaxy as it travels through the igm , @xmath55 is the internal pressure of the jet , @xmath56 is the width of the jet , and @xmath57 is the radius of curvature of the jet . we estimate the speed of the radio galaxy using the group velocity dispersion .",
    "the pressure in the jets is determined at a position in the jet immediately before it bends using the minimum synchrotron pressure as outlined in @xcite .",
    "standard equipartition of energy between relativistic particles and magnetic fields is assumed .",
    "we assume a radio spectral index of @xmath58 in the jets through the point where they bend as is seen in other fri sources with high - resolution , multi - frequency radio data @xcite .",
    "our values for the minimum synchrotron pressure in the jets are in good agreement with other measurements for similar radio sources @xcite .",
    "observations of straight fri sources show that the minimum synchrotron pressure in the jets does not balance the observed external pressure from the intergalactic gas as measured by modeling its x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the standard assumption is that entrained thermal protons are likely responsible for the additional energy density above that provided by the relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the jets .",
    "this entrained material must have a lower temperature than the surrounding hot gas because the x - ray surface brightness decreases at the locations of the radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here we consider both the case without entrained material and the case where entrained material provides five times the energy density of the relativistic electrons .",
    "the ratio of energy density between the relativistic electrons and the entrained material is not well constrained , however , a factor of five is typical on scales of @xmath59 kpc ( croston & hardcastle 2010 _ in prep _ ) .",
    "we find an intergalactic gas density of @xmath60 or @xmath61 when entrained thermal protons provide additional internal pressure in the jets . with the standard equipartition minimum synchrotron pressure from relativistic electrons only ,",
    "the density of the intergalactic gas that ngc 4061 is traveling through is @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "this intergalactic gas density , for the case including entrained protons , is very similar to the density in the model fit to the x - ray emitting intergalactic gas at the projected position of ngc 4061 ( @xmath16 kpc from the x - ray centre ) .",
    "we have good reason to believe that ngc 4061 is located within the x - ray emitting gas because the x - ray contours trace the flaring ends of the jets very closely .",

    "it has a radial velocity of 7551 km s@xmath19 and is of the morphological type sc .",
    "as has been mentioned earlier , this galaxy shows significant deficiency .",
    "additionally , it may be traveling through the x - ray emitting hot gas in the core of this group which makes it an interesting target in which to study how a hot igm affects the neutral gas content of spiral galaxies .",

    "this emission is the result of star formation in the disk of the galaxy.,width=317 ]          figure [ fig : hires ] shows a high resolution ( @xmath68 ) hi column density image of ugc 07049 overlaid on an optical r band image .",
    "the hi distribution in the disk is asymmetric , with a peak in the south of the centre of the galaxy .",
    "a distinct feature is that the hi disk is similar in extent to the optical disk . in normal late type spirals of similar morphological type , typical hi disks",
    "are found to be 1.5 to 2 times larger in extent than the optical disk .",

    "the 0.86 jy km s@xmath19 integrated flux density corresponds to an mass of @xmath71 .",

    "have been used . to take care of the difference in the surface matter density that result from the use of rc3 diameters , a value of 0.08",
    "@xcite has been added to the predicted surface density given by @xcite . assuming a distance of 100.7 mpc , derived using the optical velocity of ugc 07049 and using its rc3 diameter value 0.91@xmath64 , the hi deficiency of the galaxy is found to be @xmath78 0.41 .",
    "this implies that the galaxy is @xmath78 2.6 times deficient in hi .",
    "possible causes for the deficiency include tidal interactions , ram pressure stripping , or a combination of these two processes . in the hi images we do not see any hi tidal extensions ,",
    "although the stellar disk appears to be warped on the north - east end .",
    "recent studies have shown that in groups with x - ray bright igm ram pressure alone or tidally aided ram pressure is capable of removing a considerable fraction of the gas from constituent galaxies @xcite .",
    "the data presented here show the gaseous disk of ugc 07049 to be of similar size to the optical disk , whereas normal galaxies are known to have larger hi disks compared to their optical disks .",
    "truncated hi disks are common in clusters of galaxies and in many cases are thought to result from ram pressure stripping .",
    "the low column density gas from the outer edges of the disk is swept out by the ram pressure offered by the dense intracluster gas , leaving behind a reduced hi disk .",
    "the ngc 4065 group has been detected to have a hot igm and also a bent radio jet indicating resistance from the igm .",
    "the spiral ugc 07049 is located within the projected x - ray emitting gas . using some simple calculations we will explore whether ram pressure in this group is strong enough to strip gas from ugc 07049 .",
    "we have followed the method outlined in @xcite for calculating the possible gas loss from ugc 07049 due to ram pressure .",
    "ram pressure stripping will be effective for a galaxy when the hi surface density , @xmath79 , is less than @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the stellar surface density , @xmath82 is the local igm density and @xmath83 is the velocity with which the galaxy is moving through the medium .",
    "we use the local projected igm density of 4@xmath8410@xmath85 from the x - ray gas profile , and for the velocity of ugc 07049 we consider both the @xmath86 and @xmath87 velocity dispersion . the stellar surface density for ugc 07049 is estimated from its 2mass k - band magnitude and k - j color .",
    "relating the mass to light ratio in the k band ( @xmath88 ) to the k - j colors @xcite along with the relation of @xmath89 to the absolute magnitude in k - band ( @xmath90 ) @xcite , we estimate the stellar surface density to be 0.0194 gm @xmath29 . with this value for @xmath81 , the critical hi surface density @xmath79 beyond which ram pressure can strip gas off the galaxy ,",
    "is estimated to be @xmath91 or 2.3@xmath8410@xmath92 @xmath29 .",
    "we assume the hi surface density distribution inside ugc 07049 to be of constant thickness and with a gaussian profile ,    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the radius within which half the hi mass is present",
    ". for @xmath95 an average value of 20 m@xmath96 pc@xmath97 , as seen in normal late type spirals @xcite in group environments was used .",
    "the central hi column density of ugc 07049 also could have been used but the disk was too disturbed and there was a central hi depletion in the high resolution map and thus the map was not used for estimating the @xmath95 value . integrating the surface density distribution to equal the",
    "entire observed mass allows us to solve for @xmath94 and find a value of @xmath98 kpc .",
    "the radius corresponding to @xmath79 is then @xmath99 kpc ( for the case where @xmath100 ) .",
    "finally the hi mass outside this radius , which would be able to be ram pressure stripped , was estimated to be 7@xmath8410@xmath101 m@xmath96",
    ". a similar estimate of the stripped hi mass was done with the @xmath86 velocity dispersion and , understandably , produced a smaller mass loss .",
    "these calculations assume the galaxy is traveling face - on through the igm and they do not take into account any of the galaxy s orbital history .",
    "compared to the observed hi deficiency the amount of ram pressure stripped is very small , indicating that under the assumed criteria ram pressure alone would not contribute to gas loss in a significant way .",
    "however , tidal interactions have been observed to remove large amounts of gas from galaxies in groups @xcite and can increase the effectiveness of ram pressure stripping . in this scenario , tidal interactions may disturb the gas disk , pull gas out , and reduce the column density enabling even weak ram pressure to strip off low column density gas in large quantities .",
    "it is quite possible that ugc 07049 has undergone such stripping in this group given the richness of the system , a hostile x - ray emitting dense igm , lower than normal gas content , a truncated and asymmetric hi disk , and the disturbed stellar disk .",
    "in addition to these , the possibility of this galaxy to have passed through the group core and thereby experience a higher igm density can not be ruled out .",
    "a trip through the core of this group , experiencing intergalactic gas densities nearly ten times higher , can ram pressure strip enough gas to explain the deficiency only if the galaxy velocity is as high as @xmath0 .",
    "ugc 07049 has a @xmath18 mhz radio continuum flux density of 10.9 mjy . at a distance of 100.7 mpc",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit on the star formation rate of @xmath102 using the simple relation in @xcite .",
    "this assumes a salpeter initial mass function integrated over stars with masses ranging from @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "with a measured mass of @xmath14 and a star formation rate of @xmath102 , ugc 07049 will exhaust its gas in @xmath105 myr .",
    "for comparison , the crossing time for this group , assuming a diameter of 1 mpc , is @xmath106 gyr .",
    "thus , the deficiency seen in ugc 07049 may also be a result of an elevated star formation rate .",
    "we examine two objects in the ngc 4065 group of galaxies : a bent - double radio source and an deficient spiral galaxy .",
    "we use x - ray observations and the bent - double radio source to probe the density of intergalactic gas in this group . for the deficient spiral , ugc 07049",
