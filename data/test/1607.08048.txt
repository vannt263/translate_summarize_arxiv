    "in earlier work we have studied the swimming of linear chain structures , consisting of a number of small spheres and a single large one , in the stokes limit where inertia of the spheres and the fluid is neglected @xcite . a model of this kind with two little spheres pushing a big one",
    "was first studied by golestanian @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to investigate the effects of inertia on the swimming of bodies immersed in an incompressible viscous fluid .",
    "many microorganisms are so small that the stokes limit provides a valid approximation , but for larger bodies inertia becomes important .",
    "the corresponding reactive effects are caused by the dependence of the added mass of the whole structure on its instantaneous configuration .    in models where the structure is approximated as an assembly of spheres the added mass hydrodynamic interactions",
    "are manifested as a dependence of the mass matrix on the instantaneous positions of centers . in principle",
    "the dependence can be found from the theory of potential flow .",
    "elsewhere we have used a dipole approximation to calculate the mass matrix of an assembly of spheres @xcite@xcite .",
    "the approximation is useful when all spheres are far apart , but fails for configurations where some small spheres are close to a large one . for such configurations an approximate method of calculation of the stokes friction matrix",
    "was proposed by ekiel - jeewska and felderhof @xcite . in the following we derive a similar approximation to the mass matrix on the basis of an exact expression for the field of a magnetic point dipole in the presence of a superconducting sphere , as derived by palaniappan @xcite .",
    "the corresponding scalar potential can be used in hydrodynamics if account is taken of convection of the spheres by the fluid . in sec .",
    "ii of this article we present the derivation of the approximate mass matrix in some detail .",
    "subsequently we apply the approximation in a study of the longitudinal swimming of linear chain structures with a single large sphere and a number of small ones . as an example",
    ", we calculate in sec .",
    "iii the mean swimming velocity and power for swimming of a linear chain of three small spheres and one large one on the basis of kinematics , taking into account both friction and added mass effects @xcite .",
    "we assume that the stroke is proportional to the one that is optimal at small amplitude in the stokes limit , as calculated earlier @xcite .    for a linear chain of three identical spheres the optimal stroke ,",
    "as derived from bilinear theory valid to second order in the amplitude of swimming , is nearly independent of the scale number which characterizes the effect of fluid inertia @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv we find that the same is true for chains of three small spheres and an additional large one .",
    "we show also that the bilinear theory provides a good approximation to the results derived from the kinematic approach of sec .",
    "iii .    in sec .",
    "v we calculate the corresponding actuating forces for a chain with harmonic elastic interactions and compare with the swimming of the chain with application of a cargo constraint , implying that the actuating force on the large sphere vanishes .",
    "we use bilinear theory to optimize the actuating forces subject to the cargo constraint .",
    "it turns out that the latter does not lead to a significant decrease of swimming efficiency compared to the optimum value without the constraint .",
    "finally , we study transient effects in swimming by solving the approximate equations of motion for the spheres numerically , for a chain subject to actuating forces with the cargo constraint , starting from the rest situation .",

    "after fifty periods we can repeat the procedure with the final values of coordinates and momenta as initial conditions to get a closer approximation to the asymptotic periodic swimming motion . the final period in the numerical calculation is used to get the mean swimming velocity , the mean rate of dissipation , and the efficiency @xmath285 for that period .",
