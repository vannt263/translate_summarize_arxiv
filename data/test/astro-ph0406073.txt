    "the origin of these modes is still a matter of debate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is anticipated , however , that modeling accurately their origin and physical properties will provide the first measurements of the spins of black holes in the universe as well as direct tests of strong - field general relativity @xcite .",
    "systematic studies of modes in accretion disks around black holes have so far been mostly analytical , performed in the linear regime for flows with an artificial viscosity law ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ; see , however , gammie & balbus 1994 and menou 2003 for studies of mhd disks ) .",
    "these studies have shown the presence of three types of trapped global modes , namely inertial - gravity , corrugation , and inertial - pressure modes , with properties that appear to agree with observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "despite their success , analytical models have several limitations .",
    "first , they rely on a number of approximations , such as the wkb approximation in the radial direction .",
    "second , because only linear terms in perturbations are taken into account , these studies are unable to reproduce resonances and couplings between various modes . however , the detected qpos often have fractional amplitudes as large as 40% of the total x - ray flux , making the linear approximation inaccurate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "answering all the above questions necessitates a systematic , numerical study of accretion disk oscillations .",

    "in fact , no numerical simulation of hydrodynamic disks to date has resulted in solutions that show all three types of accretion - disk modes that were discovered analytically . in this series of papers ,",
    "we perform a systematic study of the oscillatory behavior of hydrodynamic and mhd accretion disks in two and three dimensions . to this end , we have developed a pseudo - spectral numerical algorithm , which we present here . even though spectral methods have been used extensively in the study of hydrodynamic modes in various planetary atmospheres , including the earth s ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their application to the studies of accretion disks has been very limited @xcite .",
    "spectral algorithms are high order numerical methods and are perfectly suited to studying modes of hydrodynamic flows for a number of reasons .",
    "their major advantage is accuracy and economy in the number of degrees of freedom @xcite . in spectral methods ,",
    "only @xmath0 collocation points are needed to resolve one wavelength @xcite , whereas in finite difference methods a lot more grid points are required to reach the same accuracy .",
    "the solution is already expressed as a set of orthogonal modes ; this property improves the accuracy of studies of mode coupling and resonance .",
    "moreover , the dimensionality of the problem can be altered very easily , for investigating the effects of the number of spatial dimensions on the properties of hydrodynamic modes and turbulence . in simulating mhd flows ,",
    "the high order of spectral methods allows for the equations to be solved in terms of the vector potential and not of the magnetic field itself ; this guarantees that the resulting magnetic field is always divergence free . also , super spectral viscosity @xcite , which is one kind of artificial viscosity , is trivial to implement in spectral methods .",

    "we confirm the result of @xcite , which shows that the standard solution of a viscous spreading ring @xcite is unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbation . in  6 , we present our conclusions .",
    "we consider two - dimensional , viscous , compressible flows . in this first paper , we neglect self - gravity and the magnetic fields of the flows .",

    "in our numerical algorithm , we use pseudo - spectral methods to evaluate the spatial derivatives in the partial differential equations and an explicit runge - kutta method to advance the solution in time .",

    "the convective form , on the other hand , is able to reproduce various analytical stability criteria , as shown in ",

    "this method ensure that the spectral coefficients of the perturbed function converge exponentially , and avoids changing the direction of the characteristic at the boundary .    in our calculations",
    ", we require the initial perturbations to be smooth , i.e. , we require the spectrum of the perturbations to converge exponentially .",
    "one simple method to obtain such a perturbation is to generate random noise in spectral space , multiply the noise by an exponential filter , and transform the noise back to physical space .    to formulate this method",

    "unfortunately , these methods do not generally work for spectral methods .",

    "a naive dirichlet or neumann boundary treatment fails to take care of these oscillations between inflowing and outgoing characteristics . when the inflowing boundary conditions are not given , or when the outgoing boundary conditions are not consistent with the solutions in the computation domain , the system of differential equations is ill - posed and the algorithm diverges .",
