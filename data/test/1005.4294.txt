    "measuring the casimir force @xcite has been the aim of an increasing number of experiments in the last years .",
    "the comparison of these measurements with predictions from quantum electrodynamics theory have been applied to put constraints on hypothetical new forces predicted by unification models @xcite .",
    "accurate theoretical computations , accounting for a modeling of experimental conditions , are sorely needed for all comparisons to be reliable @xcite .",
    "the casimir force is indeed very sensitive to experimental conditions . the effect of finite conductivity @xcite plays an essential role in the accurate determination of the force while the contribution of thermal fluctuations gives rise to a remarkable interplay with the latter effect @xcite . in the calculations performed for the geometry of two parallel plates ,",
    "the casimir force computed within the dissipative drude model turns out to be a factor of 2 smaller than the result obtained within the lossless plasma model . as a consequence",
    ", the plasma theory of the casimir effect can not be obtained from the drude one by taking the corresponding relaxation constant to zero . the current experimental results @xcite",
    "do not explore the region where the calculations for lossy and lossless models give large differences but their precision is sufficient to favor the plasma over the drude theory , in spite of the dissipative nature of the metallic plates used in the experiments .",
    "now , the most precise experiments are performed with a spherical metallic surface in front of a plane surface .",
    "the force is usually derived from the force evaluated in the parallel - plate geometry with subsequent averaging over the local separation distances .",
    "this proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite is expected to provide an accurate description in the limit of large sphere radii ( see @xcite for derivations with perfect mirrors at zero temperature ) .",
    "even if spheres used in the experiments are much larger than the typical distance between them , it remains necessary to master the beyond - pfa geometry correction @xcite even for large spheres in order to match the experimental accuracy level .",
    "there is no reason why the thermal , finite - conductivity and beyond - pfa corrections could be expected to be independent .",
    "therefore , an accurate description of the experimental conditions has to take these effects into account simultaneously within a single theoretical model . in this paper , we develop the beyond - pfa scattering approach @xcite for the plane - sphere geometry at finite temperature , with material properties described by either the perfect reflector , plasma or drude models .",
    "we show that the interplay between temperature and material properties is drastically affected when the parallel - plate configuration is replaced by the plane - sphere geometry .",
    "the results obtained from the drude and plasma models are generally closer to each other than in the parallel - plate geometry .",
    "in particular , the factor of 2 between the two models reached at the limit of long distances between parallel plates is reduced to 3/2 for a plate and a sphere , and even less if small spheres are considered .",
    "finally , we find that pfa underestimates the thermal contribution to the casimir force for the drude model at short distances , whereas it overestimates it at all distances for the perfect reflector and plasma models .",
    "we start from the scattering theory of casimir interaction @xcite , which allows one to consider non - trivial geometries at finite temperatures together with a realistic description of the material properties .",
    "the casimir free energy is written in terms of general reflection operators , which describe non - specular diffraction by the material surfaces .",
    "the resulting formula provides a compact way of taking into account the multiple scatterings between the interacting bodies @xcite . in the particular case of parallel plane surfaces ,",
    "the reflection operators are diagonal in the plane - wave basis , so that the casimir free energy is given in terms of specular reflection coefficients @xcite . in the plane - sphere geometry , scattering on the sphere",
    "is easily made explicit in the multipole spherical - waves basis @xcite ( see also @xcite for a treatment of non - retarded interactions ) .",
    "it is also essential to combine the multipole basis with the plane wave basis @xcite well adapted to the treatment of non - ideal reflection by metals . by judiciously employing the two bases at appropriate steps of the derivation",
    ", the scattering formalism thus allows to analyse the interplay between geometry and finite conductivity at zero @xcite and non - zero temperature @xcite .",
    "let us note that several papers have been devoted in the recent years to the study of the casimir effect in non - planar geometries .",
    "besides the already cited papers , let us refer to the following applications of the scattering approach @xcite or of alternative methods @xcite .",
    "the first application of the scattering approach to non - trivial geometries and non - ideal reflectors can be found in @xcite .",
    "an historial overview of the various forms of the multiple scattering method can be found in @xcite . in this paper , we analyse in a detailed manner the full interplay between finite conductivity , finite temperature and plane - sphere geometry , which was only briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : our main goals and basic notations are presented in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we develop the scattering approach for the plane - sphere geometry and derive the formal results used in secs .",
    "iv ( perfect reflectors ) and v ( plasma and drude models ) . concluding remarks",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "we consider the casimir interaction between a metallic sphere of radius @xmath0 and a metallic plate at a distance of closest approach @xmath1 at an arbitrary temperature @xmath2 as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the center - to - plate distance is @xmath3 experimental results for the casimir force in the plane - sphere geometry are usually compared with pfa - based theoretical models @xcite .",
    "the spherical surface is assumed to be nearly flat over a scale of the order of @xmath4 and then the total casimir energy is obtained by adding the contributions corresponding to different local inter - plate distances over the sphere surface . although the casimir energy is not additive , pfa is usually expected to provide an accurate description when @xmath5 the resulting casimir force @xmath6 is @xmath7 @xmath8 is the casimir free energy for two parallel plates of area @xmath9 thus , pfa neglects diffraction due to the sphere curvature and provides a direct connection to the parallel - plates geometry , the force being proportional to the casimir free energy per unit area calculated for this much simpler geometry .     and a flat plate at a distance @xmath1 , with center - to - plate distance @xmath10,width=113 ]    in this paper , we develop an exact theoretical model taking diffraction fully into account .",
    "we first compute the casimir free energy @xmath11 for the plane - sphere geometry from the scattering formula @xcite ( sec .",
    "iii ) and then derive the force @xmath12 and entropy @xmath13 from @xmath14    the latter is at the core of the ongoing debate about a possible violation of the third law of thermodynamics in the dissipative drude model @xcite .",
    "negative casimir entropy values found for parallel plates have been explained in terms of the coupling to a heat bath associated to dissipation @xcite .",
    "but here we find negative entropies even for the perfect reflector model , showing that geometry itself plays a non - trivial thermodynamical role , provided that beyond - pfa diffraction effects are taken into account .",
    "to quantify the deviation from pfa , we define the quantity @xmath15    the ratio @xmath16 represents the temperature correction at a given separation distance and for a given model . in the next sections ,",
    "we calculate @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the perfect reflector , plasma and drude models for metallic surfaces .",
    "the drude dielectric function @xmath19 at imaginary frequencies @xmath20 contains two frequency scales : the plasma frequency @xmath21 and the relaxation frequency @xmath22 the plasma dielectric function is obtained from ( [ drude ] ) in the lossless limit @xmath23 note , however , that there is no continuity in the casimir force from the drude to the plasma model in this limit @xcite . by taking the further limit @xmath24 from the plasma model , we recover the perfect reflector limit ( to be discussed in sec .",
    "iv ) , which corresponds to an infinite dielectric function at all frequencies .    in sec .",
    "v , we provide a detailed comparison between plasma and drude models for the casimir effect . since the dc conductivity @xmath25 diverges in the limit @xmath26 the drude model is expected , in principle , to provide a more realistic description of normal ( i.e. , non - superconducting ) metals .",
    "however , experimental data are surprisingly in better agreement with the plasma model when pfa is employed to analyze the plane - sphere geometry @xcite . here we show that the results from the two models are actually closer than predicted by pfa - based theories , which might help to solve this paradox .",
    "we consider a rich parameter space containing five different length scales : besides the geometrical scales @xmath1 and @xmath0 , our problem contains the thermal wavelength ( @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant ) @xmath28 the plasma wavelength @xmath29 and the wavelength corresponding to the relaxation frequency @xmath30 different orderings of these length scales can in principle be considered , leading to various regimes associated to non - trivial interplays between temperature , geometry , finite conductivity and dissipation .",
    "most experiments are performed with gold at room temperature , hence the numerical results presented in the following sections correspond to @xmath31 @xmath32 ( plasma and drude ) and @xmath33 ( drude ) .",
    "in this section , we apply the scattering approach to the plane - sphere geometry ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) at finite temperature .",
    "the casimir free energy is written as a sum over the matsubara frequencies @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) @xcite : @xmath36 where the primed sum means that the @xmath37 term is counted for a half .",

    "reflection on the plane also preserves all plane wave quantum numbers but the propagation direction , and the non zero elements of @xmath53 are given by the standard fresnel specular reflection amplitudes @xmath54 for an homogenous medium .    on the other hand , the multipole basis @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 denoting the usual angular momentum eigenvalues ( with @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 representing electric and magnetic multipoles , is well adapted to the spherical symmetry of @xmath61 . by rotational symmetry around the @xmath41-axis",

    "hence @xmath62 is block diagonal , and each block @xmath64 ( corresponding to a given subspace @xmath57 ) yields an independent contribution to the casimir energy .",
    "we find its matrix elements in the multipole basis after introducing the spectral resolution of the identity operator in the plane wave basis : @xmath65 this expression has a simple interpretation when read from right to left : a multipole wave @xmath66 is first decomposed into plane waves ( coefficients @xmath67 ) which propagate towards the plane ( factor @xmath68 ) .",

    "the overestimation is , however , clearly smaller than for perfect reflectors . since pfa results for plasma metals are above the values calculated for drude metals , the exact beyond - pfa casimir force values at short distances for drude and plasma models turn out to be much closer than predicted by the pfa - based theoretical models used in the analysis of experimental data .",

    "the fact that @xmath203 depends on @xmath0 is a clear signature of the interplay between geometry , temperature and dissipation .",

    "in this paper , we have used the scattering approach to compute the casimir free energy and force in the plane - sphere geometry , taking into account both the non zero temperature and the metallic nature of reflectors .    for the simpler case of perfect metals at intermediate distances ,",
    "we observe from numerical computations a strong correlation between thermal and geometry effects , and negative entropy values for small spheres , which are clearly not related to dissipation but rather to geometry itself . for small spheres ,",
    "thermal photons provide a repulsive contribution , thus diminishing the total attractive casimir force .",
    "those results are endorsed by analytical derivations in the long distance regime .    for the case of drude metals , evidence of correlations between temperature and dissipation , qualitatively different from those in the parallel plates geometry ,",
    "as a consequence , the results for the loss less plasma and full drude models are closer to each other than in the parallel - plate geometry , with the long distance ratio of 2 reduced to at most 3/2 .",
