    "understanding strong correlation effect away from equilibrium has been one of the most interesting yet challenging problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "a prominent realization of such phenomena is embodied in quantum transport through a nanostructure under finite bias voltage . to understand the interplay of the correlation effect and nonequilibrium nature , nonequilibrium version of the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) and its extensions",
    "have been serving and continue to do so as a central theoretical model .",
    "the siam is indeed considered to be one of the best studied strongly correlated model , and despite its apparent simplicity , it exhibits rich physics already in equilibrium , such as the coulomb blockade and the kondo physics that have been observed in experiments .",
    "equilibrium properties of the siam have been well understood thanks to concerted efforts of several theoretical approaches over years  by perturbative treatment , fermi liquid description , as well as exact results by the bethe ansatz method and numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations  ( see for instance , . ) in contrast , the situation of the nonequilibrium siam is not so satisfactory .",
    "each of the above approaches has met some difficulty in treating nonequilibrium phenomena . a theoretical approach that can deal with the strong correlation effect in nonequilibrium is still called for .    notwithstanding , a number of analytical and numerical methods have been devised to investigate nonequilibrium stationary phenomena : nonequilibrium perturbation approaches  @xcite and its modifications  @xcite , the non - crossing approximation  @xcite , the functional renormalization group treatment  @xcite , quantum monte carlo calculations on the keldysh contour  @xcite , the iterative real - time path integral method  @xcite and so on .",
    "unfortunately those approaches fail to give a consistent picture concerning the finite bias effect on the dot spectral function , particularly regarding a possible splitting of the kondo resonance .    as for the equilibrium siam ,",
    "the second - order perturbation regarding the coulomb interaction @xmath0 on the dot  @xcite is known to capture essential features of kondo physics and agrees qualitatively well with exact results obtained by the bethe ansatz and nrg approaches  @xcite .",
    "such good agreement seems to persist in nonequilibrium stationary state at finite bias voltage .",
    "for the two - terminal particle - hole ( ph ) symmetric siam , a recent study by @xcite showed that the nonequilibrium second order perturbation calculation of the spectral function agrees with that calculated by the diagrammatic quantum monte carlo simulation , excellently up to interaction strength @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the total relaxation rate due to leads ) ; pretty well even for @xmath3 at bias voltage @xmath4 .",
    "a typical magnitude of @xmath5 of a semiconductor quantum dot is roughly @xmath6 depending on the size and the configuration of the dot .",
    "therefore , there is a good chance of describing a realistic system within the validity of nonequilibrium perturbation approach .",
    "the great advantage of semiconductor dot systems is to allow us to control several physical parameters .",
    "those include changing gate voltage as well as configuring a more involved structure such as a multi - terminal dot  @xcite or an interferometer embedding a quantum dot .",
    "theoretical treatments often limit themselves to a system with the ph symmetry where the dot occupation number is fixed to be one half per spin .",
    "although assuming the ph symmetry makes sense and comes in handy in extracting the essence of the kondo resonance , we should bear in mind that such symmetry is not intrinsic and can be broken easily in realistic systems , by gate voltage , asymmetry of the coupling with the leads , or asymmetric drops of bias voltage  @xcite .",
    "the ph asymmetry commonly appears in a multi - terminal dot or in an interferometer embedding a quantum dot .",
    "it is also argued that the effect of the ph asymmetry might be responsible for the deviation observed in nonequilibrium transport experiments from the `` universal '' behavior of the ph symmetric siam  @xcite . to work on realistic systems ,",
    "it is imperative to understand how the ph asymmetry affects nonequilibrium transport .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the second - order nonequilibrium perturbation regarding the coulomb interaction @xmath0 of the multi - terminal siam .",
    "the ph symmetry is not assumed , and miscellaneous types of asymmetry of couplings to the leads and/or voltage drops are incorporated as a generic multi - terminal configuration . our main focus is to provide solid analytical results of the behavior of the nonequilibrium self - energy and hence the dot spectral function for the full range of frequency and bias voltage , within the validity of the second - order perturbation theory of @xmath0 .",
    "the result encompasses fermi liquid behavior as well as incoherent non - fermi liquid contribution , showing analytically that increasing finite bias voltage leads to a crossover from the kondo resonance to the coulomb blockade behaviors .",
    "the present work contrasts preceding perturbative studies  @xcite whose evaluations relied on either numerical means or a small - parameter expansion of bias voltage and frequency .",
    "the only notable exception , to the author s knowledge , is a recent work by @xcite , which succeeded in evaluating analytically the second - order self - energy for the two - terminal ph symmetric dot . intending to apply such analysis to a wider range of realistic systems and examine the effect that the two - terminal ph symmetric siam can not capture , we extend their approach to a generic multi - terminal dot where the ph symmetry may not necessarily be present .",
    "an embarrassing drawback of using the nonequilibrium perturbation theory is that when one has it naively apply to the ph asymmetric siam , it may disrespect the preservation of the steady current .",
    "@xcite as a result , one then needs some current - preserving prescription , and different self - consistent schemes have been proposed and adopted .  @xcite",
    "as will be seen , the current preserving condition involves all the frequency range , not only of low frequency region that validates fermi liquid description but also of the incoherent non - fermi liquid part ( see eq .   below ) .",
    "therefore , an approximation based on the low energy physics , particularly the fermi liquid picture , should be used with care .",
    "the self - energy we will construct analytically is checked to satisfy the spectral sum rule at finite bias voltage , so that we regard it as giving a consistent description for the full range of frequency in nonequilibrium . by taking its advantage",
    ", we also demonstrate a self - consistent , current - preserving calculation of the nonequilibrium spectral function for a system where the ph symmetry is not present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the multi - terminal siam in nonequilibrium .",
    "we review briefly how to obtain the exact current formula by clarifying the role of the current conservation at finite bias voltage .",

    "the total hamiltonian of the system consists of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the dot hamiltonian with the coulomb interaction , the hopping term between the dot and the leads , and the hamiltonian of a noninteracting lead @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "they are specified by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dot electron number operator with spin @xmath16 and @xmath17 are electron operators at the lead @xmath13 . in the following ,",

    "all the effect of the lead @xmath13 is encoded in terms of its chemical potential @xmath8 and relaxation rate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the density of states of the lead @xmath13 . the dot level @xmath20 controls the average occupation number on the dot ; it corresponds roughly to @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the ph symmetry is realized when @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see eqs .   and below ) .",
    "we here briefly summarize how the current through the dot is determined in a multi - terminal setting .",
    "special attention is paid to the role of the current conservation because it has been known that nonequilibrium perturbation calculation does not respect it in general .",
    "@xcite we illustrate how to ensure the current conservation by requiring minimally .",
    "the argument below is valid regardless of a specific approximation scheme chosen , whether nonequilibrium perturbation or any other approach .",
    "following the standard protocol of the keldysh formulation  @xcite , we start with writing the current @xmath29 flowing from the lead @xmath13 to the dot in terms of the dot s lesser green function @xmath30 and the retarded one @xmath31 : @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the fermi distribution function at the lead @xmath13 .",
    "as the present model preserves the total spin as well as charge , the net spin current flowing to the dot should vanish in the steady state , which imposes the integral relation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath34 = 0 .",

    "a general connection between @xmath42 and @xmath43 is not known so far .",
    "it is remarked that , based on the quasiparticle picture , a noninteracting relation @xmath56 is sometimes used to deduce an approximate form of @xmath42 out of @xmath43 for an interacting dot .",
    "such approximation is called the ng s ansatz  @xcite .",

    "contribution to the dot occupation number comes from all range of frequency , including the incoherent part .",

    "the applicability of quasi - particle approaches that ignores the incoherent part is unclear .",
    "in this section , we evaluate analytically the nonequilibrium retarded self - energy up to the second order of interaction strength @xmath0 for the multi - terminal siam .",

    "although there is a consensus that bias voltage starts suppressing the kondo peak , and eventually destroys it with developing the two coulomb peaks when bias voltage is much larger than the kondo temperature , there is a controversy as to whether the kondo resonance peak will be split or not in the intermediate range of bias voltage .",
    "all the results obtained by the second - order perturbation consistently indicate that there is no split of the kondo resonance ; finite bias voltage starts to suppress the kondo resonance , and develops the two coulomb blockade peaks by shifting the spectral weight from the kondo resonance .",
    "we should mention that some other approximations draw a different conclusion . here",
    "we make a few remarks on apparent discrepancy seen in various theoretical approaches as well as experiments , as well as some speculation based on our results .",

    "generally speaking , the spectral function obtained by those approaches does not obey the spectral weight sum rule : ignoring the doubly occupied state typically leads to the sum rule @xmath191  @xcite , rather than the correct value .",
    "therefore only half of the spectral weight can be accounted for in those methods .",
    "simultaneously , such ( false ) sum rule in conjugation with the bias - suppression of the kondo resonance can not hep but lead to a two - peak structure of the spectrum within the range of attention .",
    "splitting of the kondo resonance might be an artifact of the approximation .",
    "not fulfilling the correct sum rule , those approaches may not be able to distinguish whether finite bias will split the kondo resonance or simply suppresses it with developing the coulomb peaks .",

    "the results seem unsettled , though .",
    "while @xcite suggested the fourth - order term may yield the splitting of the kondo resonance in the intermediate bias region @xmath192 for sufficiently large interaction @xmath193 , which the second - order calculation fails to report , another numerical study indicates that the spectral function remains qualitatively the same with the second - order result  @xcite .",
    "experimental situation is not so transparent , either .",
    "while the splitting of the kondo resonance was reported in a three - terminal conductance measurement in a quantum ring system  @xcite , a similar spitting observed in the differential conductivity was attributed to being caused by a spontaneous formation of ferromagnetic contacts , not purely to bias effect  @xcite .",
    "it is also pointed out that it has been recently recognized that the rashba spin - orbit coupling induces spin polarization nonmagnetically in a quantum ring system with a dot when applying finite bias voltage  @xcite ; hence such spin magnetization might possibly lead to the splitting of the kondo resonance .",
    "the kondo resonance is a manifestation of singlet formation between the dot and the lead electrons .",
    "one may naively think that when several chemical potentials are connected with the dot , such singlet formation would take place at each lead _ separately _ , causing multiple kondo resonances . the results of the multi - terminal ph symmetric siam presented in the previous section tempt us to speculate a different picture . let us suppose that ( almost ) the same dot distribution function @xmath194 is realized for a fixed @xmath185 with a different terminal number @xmath180 , as fig .",
    "[ fig : nldos - by - dmu ] ( a ) suggests . note the assumption is fully consistent to the ward identity for low bias , but it invalidates a quasiparticle ansatz @xmath195 that explicitly depends on @xmath180 . in the large @xmath180 limit with a fixed @xmath185 ,",
    "the effective fermi distribution @xmath188 resembles the fermi distribution at finite temperature @xmath196 .",
    "accordingly bias voltage may well give effect similar to finite temperature .",
    "it is seen in low and large bias limit for a dot with or without the ph symmetry .",

    "the present analysis serves as a viable tool that can cover a wide range of experimental situations .",
