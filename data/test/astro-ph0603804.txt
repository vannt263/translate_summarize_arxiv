    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are thought to be stars with masses about 0.5  m@xmath1 with thin ( @xmath2@xmath3m@xmath1 ) hydrogen shells and temperatures from @xmath4 to @xmath5  k ( heber et al . 1984 ; saffer et al . 1994 ) , making them exceedingly blue .",
    "pulsating sdb stars come in two varieties : short period ( 90 to 600 seconds ) named ec  14026 - 2647 stars after that prototype , officially v361  hya stars or sdbv stars , with amplitudes typically near 1% ; and long period ( 45 minutes to 2 hours ) named pg  1716 + 426 stars after that prototype or lpsdbv stars , with amplitudes typically @xmath20.1% . for more on these stars",
    "see kilkenny ( 2001 ) and green et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . for this work , our interest is the ec  14026 ( sdbv ) class of pulsators as their periods are short , so many pulsation cycles can be observed during each run from a single site .",
    "pulsating sdb stars potentially allow the opportunity to discern their interior structure using asteroseismology , obtaining estimates of total mass , luminosity , shell mass , radiative levitation , gravitational diffusion , and helium fusion cross sections .",
    "however , to apply the tools of asteroseismology , the pulsation frequencies ( periods ) must first be resolved .",
    "variable star discovery surveys seldom resolve or detect the complete set of pulsations .",
    "multisite campaigns , because of the complexity of organization , have only observed a few sdb pulsators .    our programme is to resolve poorly - studied sdb pulsators , typically from single - site data .",
    "this method has proven useful for the sdbv stars feige  48 and kpd  2109 + 4401 ( reed et al .",
    "2004 ; zhou et al .",
    "2006 ) . for these observations",
    ", we obtained most of our data at a modest sized telescope ( 1.3  m ) combined with higher signal - to - noise ( s / n ) observations on a 2.4  m telescope .",
    "this combination allows us to effectively resolve the pulsation spectrum of sdbv stars and detect low amplitude pulsations that were below the detection limit of the discovery data .",
    "our high s / n data from larger telescopes can detect pulsation amplitudes as low as 0.5 milli - modulation amplitudes ( mma , equivalent to 0.05% ) , insuring that we do not miss low amplitude modes . our typical temporal resolution is better than 1.5  @xmath6hz .",
    "this paper reports the results of our follow - up observations on the sdbv stars pg  0154 + 182 ( hereafter pg  0154 ) , hs  1824 + 5745 ( hereafter hs  1824 ) , and hs  2151 + 0857 ( hereafter hs  2151 ) .",
    "pg  0154 ( @xmath7=15.3 ) was reported as a pulsator by koen et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter k04 ) who detected a single frequency at 6090  @xmath6hz .",
    "their observations consisted of three @xmath8 hour observing runs which were obtained under less - than ideal conditions and were certainly insufficient to resolve the pulsations . from optical spectroscopy and 2mass infrared data",
    ", they also determined that pg  0154 has a main sequence g5 - k5 companion .",
    "hs  1824 ( @xmath7=15.6 ) and hs  2151 ( @xmath7=16.5 ) were determined to be variable by stensen et al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter 01 ) as part of a four star discovery paper .",
    "( observations of the other two variables will be reported elsewhere . )",
    "they detected a single frequency in hs  1824 and four in hs  2151 .",
    "their observations consisted of three @xmath9 hour runs for hs  1824 and two @xmath9 hour and one 2.5 hour run for hs  2151 . as such , the pulsations were likely unresolved and ideal for follow - up observations .",
    "both hs stars are apparently single with @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 for hs  1824 and hs  2151 , respectively .",
    "data were obtained at mdm observatory s 2.4  m and 1.3  m telescopes using an apogee alta u47 + ccd camera .",
    "this camera is connected via usb2.0 for high - speed readout : our binned ( @xmath14 ) images had an average dead - time of one second .",
    "the observations used a red cut - off filter ( bg38 ) so the effective bandpass covers that of b and v filters and is essentially that of a blue - sensitive photomultiplier tube .",
    "such a setup allows us to maximize light throughput while maintaining compatibility with observations obtained with photomultiplier photometers .",
    "tables  [ tab01 ] through [ tab03 ] provide the details of our observations including date , start time , integration time and run length .",
    "pg  0154 was observed as a secondary target during our fall 2004 kpd  2109 data run ( reported in zhou et al .",
    "we obtained short data runs ( @xmath15 hr ) over nine nights .",
    "hs  1824 was the subject of a concerted effort , with more than 125 hours of data obtained during three different observing runs , two at the 1.3  m and the last at the 2.4  m telescopes .",
    "after the first observing run on hs  1824 , we began observing hs  2151 as a secondary target .",
    "more than 42 hours of data were obtained of hs  2151 during three nights on the 1.3  m and six on the 2.4  m telescopes .",
    "though only the observations of hs  1824 conform to our normal programme ( long time - series observations covering several weeks ) , we feel that we have successfully resolved all of the pulsations .",
    ".observations of pg  0154 + 182 during 2004 on the mdm 1.3  m telescope [ tab01 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for hs  2151 , where we have five frequencies to work with , no two frequency spacings are similar . as such ,",
    "we are left with the following possibilities for the five pulsation frequencies detected : 1 ) rotation is sufficiently slow that all @xmath16 values are degenerate ; 2 ) at most one pair share the same @xmath17 and @xmath0 values with differing @xmath16 , which seems very unlikely ; 3 ) our line of sight is along the pulsation axis , with @xmath18 , making only @xmath19 modes observable because of geometric cancellation ( pesnell 1985 ; reed , brondel , & kawaler 2005 ) ; or 4 ) internal rotation is such that rotationally - induced multiplets are widely spaced and uneven ( kawaler & hostler 2005 ) .",
    "an open question involving sdbv stars is the mode degree @xmath0 of the pulsations . in resolved sdbv stars",
    ", we sometimes observe many more pulsation modes than @xmath0=0 , 1 , and 2 can provide .",
    "higher @xmath0 modes may be needed , but if so they must have a larger intrinsic amplitude because of the large degree of geometric cancellation ( charpinet et al .",
    "2005 ; reed , brondel , & kawaler 2005 ) .",
    "a general guideline would be one @xmath17 order per @xmath0 degree per 1000  @xmath6hz .",
    "as such , the temporal spectrum can accommodate three frequencies per 1000  @xmath6hz without the necessity of invoking high-@xmath0 values .    for pg  0154 , even ignoring the frequency spacing that inter - relates several frequencies , it is still easy to accommodate all the frequencies without the need for @xmath20 modes .",
    "the pulsation spectrum for hs  2151 is slightly more dense and we do not detect any related frequencies .",
    "however , it is still possible to fit the frequencies within the range observed without invoking @xmath20 modes if the 6616 and 6859  @xmath6hz frequencies are related to those near 7725  @xmath6hz . as such",
    ", we can deduce that the pulsations in all three pulsators in this paper _ can _ be accommodated using @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 modes .",
    "however , this by no means implies that they are .",
    "another feature we can examine is the amount of amplitude variability in the pulsations .",
    "if pulsating sdb stars are observed over an extended time period , it is common to detect amplitude variability in many , if not all , of the pulsation frequencies .",
    "such variability can occasionally be ascribed to beating between pulsations too closely spaced to be resolved in any subsets of the data , but often appear in clearly resolved pulsation spectra where mode beating can not be the cause .",
    "figure  [ fig05 ] shows the amplitudes of the pulsations of pg  0154 for individual nights .",
    "the scale is selected ( for all of the amplitude and phase plots ) such that a 10% errorbar occupies @xmath2410% of the panel .",
    "all of the amplitudes are essentially constant to within the errors except for @xmath25 , which triples in amplitude over the course of the run .",
    "we initially suspected it was caused by an unresolved doublet of frequencies , which could still be the case .",
    "however , several other frequencies show the same general trend ( though on smaller scales ) and the amplitude variations do not appear sinusoidal , which would be expected with mode beating .",
    "as such , we doubt our initial interpretation and rather think these variations are intrinsic .",
    "however , the only way to be sure is to obtain more observations .",
    "still , the net result is that five of six frequencies are stable both in amplitude and phase ( not shown as all of the phases are constant to within the errors ) .    of significantly more interest",
    "are the amplitudes and phases of the single frequency present in hs  1824 .",
    "these are shown in figure  [ fig06 ] and indicate that they are quite variable .",
    "between observing days 41 and 45 ( jd=2453531.5 and 2453536.5 ) , the amplitude rises from 0.9 to 4.2  mma while the phases change by @xmath26% between days 42 and 46 .",
    "clearly , hs  1824 is both amplitude and phase variable ; possibly an indicator of stochastic pulsations ( discussed in the next section ) .",
    "note that phases are chosen such that the phase is the time of first maximum since jd=2453279.5 for pg  0154 , jd=2453491.5 for hs  1824 and hs  2151 divided by the period .",
    "figure  [ fig07 ] shows the amplitudes and phases of the three well separated frequencies of hs  2151 .",
    "the doublet near 7725  @xmath6hz is not resolvable on a nightly basis . in this case ,",
    "two of the three frequencies ( @xmath27 and @xmath25 ) have amplitude variations marginally larger than the errors which appear to follow the same trend .",
    "one possible explanation would be if they are two parts of a multiplet sharing an increase in driving power , though such a hypothesis can not be tested using these data .",
    "for all three frequencies , the phases vary over the duration of our observing campaign .",
    "the highest amplitude frequency ( @xmath25 ) is generally the most stable ; varying smoothly by 15% over the first three nights and then remaining essentially constant .",
    "the other two frequencies ( @xmath28 and @xmath27 ) both show an offset between the june and july data runs with @xmath27 essentially constant during the individual month s data .",
    "this points toward a problem with timing rather than intrinsic changes of the star .",
    "we investigated this possibility but ruled it out for the following reasons : the highest amplitude frequency does not show these , the changes are not the same in period ( i.e. , the same amount of difference in timing ) , our observations of hs  1824 , which occurred during the same nights do not show this shift ( though admittedly hs  1824 shows phase variations ) , and the timing setup is the same as we have used during all of our other runs and is checked multiple times during the night . as such , we conclude that these shifts that occurred during the 15 night interval between observations are intrinsic to the star .",
    "we can also use the criterion outlined in christensen - dalsgaard et al ( 2004 ; hereafter jcd04 ) and first applied to sdbv stars in pereira & lopes ( 2005 ) to examine the nature of the excitation mechanism .",
    "if the frequencies are stochastically excited , we can expect to find the standard deviation of the amplitudes , @xmath29 , divided by the average amplitude @xmath30 to have a value near 0.5 ( eqn .",
    "7 of pereira & lopes 2005 ) .",
    "both parameters and their ratios are given in table  [ tab08 ] for all resolved frequencies in our target stars .",
    "for pg  0154 , three of the six frequencies have relatively stable pulsation amplitudes , and their ratios reflect this as non - stochastically excited pulsations .",
    "the two low amplitude frequencies , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , have errors too large to constrain the ratio , which for @xmath25 is in between . in this case",
    "@xmath25 suffers the same problem as it did for mode beating : the time - scale of amplitude variation appears longer than our observations . as such , more data would be required to discern which interpretation is correct for @xmath25 : stochastically driven pulsations , mode beating , or variable amplitudes caused by something else .",
    "surprisingly the ratio for hs  1824 is nearly the same as for @xmath25 of pg  0154 .",
    "however we can suggest that these pulsations do not match the jcd04 criteria for stochastic oscillations as our observations are surely sufficient in duration to include several damping lifetimes , yet @xmath33 is only @xmath34 .",
    "as such , the rather large variation in amplitude and phase remains unexplained .",
    "for the three well - separated frequencies of hs  2151 , none of them have ratios indicating stochastically excited pulsations .",
    "these results indicate that at most one of our ten resolved frequencies have indications of being stochastically excited .",
    "this can be compared to our previous observations of kpd  2109 + 4401 where 50% of the resolved pulsations indicated stochastic excitation and a study of pg  1605 + 072 where _ no _ indications of stochastic excitation were found from 11 resolvable frequencies ( pereira & lopes 2005 ) . it is a bit early to interpret the meaning of such results and it is not clear what impact the discovery of many stochastically driven frequencies ( should that occur ) would mean for the proposed iron driving mechanism of charpinet et al .",

    "from extensive follow - up data acquired at mdm observatory , we are confident that we have resolved the pulsation spectra of three additional pulsating sdb stars .",
    "we are able to confirm all of the previously observed frequencies as well as detect a total of six new frequencies in two of our three targets .    for pg  0154",
    ", we have discovered five new frequencies with the closest spacing between frequencies at @xmath44hz . as such , they are readily resolvable in 1.5 hours of data , however the low amplitude of two frequencies requires high s / n or longer time - base observations to reduce the noise .",
    "we notice an enticing common frequency spacing of @xmath45hz , which could be interpreted as all six frequencies being members of one @xmath46 and one @xmath47 pulsation multiplet .",
    "however , this would require a rotation period near 25 minutes and a rotation velocity of @xmath48  km / s which is clearly ruled out by k04 .",
    "we applied the kawaler scheme to the spacings using a purely numerical fit with good results .",
    "however , as pg  0154 only has six frequencies , there is no unique solution and so we are not convinced that it should be applied in this case . as such , the cause for the large , nearly - equal frequency spacing remains a mystery .",
    "three of the six frequencies are amplitude - stable , while one shows variations that could be indicative of a stochastically excited mode .",
    "of course this would not be possible if it is actually an @xmath16 component of the same degree as other , amplitude - stable frequencies .",
    "as such , it seems we still have some to learn about pg  0154 and additional follow - up observations could still be instructive .    in hs  1824",
    "we confirmed the frequency detected by 01 , but did not uncover any additional frequencies .",
    "however , we were able to measure significant amplitude and phase variations over a long span of time .",
    "as such , once asteroseismology matures to where it can interpret such fluctuations , hs  1824 will be an excellent target .",
    "but until then , all we can readily say is that the variability in the amplitude and phase of pulsation seems unrelated to stochastically excited oscillations .    for hs  2151 ,",
    "we confirm the four previously known frequencies and detect an additional oscillation close to a previously observed one .",
    "however , none of the frequencies appear to have common spacing indicative of multiplet structure and their amplitudes appear stable , indicating non - stochastically excited pulsations .",
    "these three pulsating sdb stars show the variety , and perhaps the complexity , of oscillations observed in sdb stars .",
    "two of the three have several frequencies , while hs  1824 only had one .",
    "of the ten total frequencies , several show amplitude variations , but only one has sufficient variability to even consider stochastic excitation .",
    "several of the phases show small variations with those in hs  1824 being much larger and only one star shows a common frequency spacing that could be used to observationally constrain the pulsation degree , @xmath0 , except it would require a drastically fast rotation velocity which has been ruled out by previous spectroscopic observations .",
