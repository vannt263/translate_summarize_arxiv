    "despite the current trend that many people jumped into the four neutrino scheme ( see @xcite for complehensive references ) , the three - flavor mixing scheme of leptons , together with the three - flavor mixing scheme of quarks , still constitutes the most promising standard model for the structure of the ( known to date ) most fundamental matter in nature .",
    "it is worth to note that the two of the evidences for the neutrino oscillation , one compelling @xcite and the other strongly indicative @xcite , can be nicely fit into the three - flavor mixing scheme of neutrinos .",
    "i want to call the scheme the standard 3 @xmath3 mixing scheme in my talk .",
    "i would like to address in this talk some aspects of the three - flavor mixing scheme of neutrinos which remain to be explored untill now .",
    "while i have started with a brief remark on robustness of the standard 3 @xmath3 mixing scheme , i do not repeat it here because i have described it elsewhere @xcite . in this manuscript",
    "i discuss mainly two key issues , ( 1 ) the sign of @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) how to measure leptonic cp violation .",
    "i will use , throughout this manuscript , the mns matrix @xcite in the convention by particle data group .",
    "let me start by raising the following question ;    `` suppose that the standard 3 @xmath3 mixing scheme is what nature exploits and the atmospheric and the solar neutrino anomalies are the hints kindly provided by her to lead us to the scheme .",
    "then , what is left toward our understanding of its full structure ? ''",
    "it is conceivable that the future atmospheric and solar neutrino observations as well as currently planned long baseline experiments will determine four parameters , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , to certain accuracies .",
    "i then cite four things as in below which will probably be unexplored in the near future :    \\(i ) @xmath8",
    "\\(ii ) the sign of @xmath9 , the normal versus inverted mass hierarchies    \\(iii ) the cp violating leptonic kobayashi - maskawa phase @xmath10    \\(iv ) the absolute masses of neutrinos    i make brief comments on ( i ) and",
    "( iv ) one by one before focusing on ( ii ) and ( iii ) :    measuring @xmath8 is one of the goals of the currently planned long baseline experiments @xcite , and therefore i do not discuss it further . among them the expected sensitivity in jhf , the recently approved experiment in japan , is one of the best examined case @xcite .    measuring absolute masses of neutrinos",
    "is certainly the ultimate challenge for neutrino experiments , but it is not clear at this moment how one can do it . presumably , neutrinoless double @xmath11 decay experiments are the most promising",
    ". we , however , do not discuss it further , but just recommend the interested readers to look into a report at this conference @xcite .",
    "nunokawa and i recently discussed @xcite that the features of neutrino flavor transformation in supernova ( sn ) is sensitive to the sign of @xmath9 , making contrast between the normal ( @xmath12 ) vs. inverted ( @xmath13 ) mass hierarchies .",
    "therefore , one can obtain insight on the sign of @xmath0 by analyzing neutrino events from supernova .",
    "with use of the unique data at hand from sn1987a @xcite , we have obtained a strong indication that the normal mass hierarchy , @xmath14 , is favored over the inverted one , @xmath15 .",
    "the point is that there are always two msw resonance points in sn for neutrinos with cosmologically interesting mass range , @xmath16 ev . the higher density point , which i denote the h resonance , plays a deterministic role .",
    "if the h resonance is adiabatic the feature of @xmath3 flavor transformation in sn is best characterized as @xmath17 exchange , as first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath18 collectively denotes @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are physically indistinguishable in sn .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent complehensive treatment of 3 @xmath3 flavor conversion in sn .",
    "now the question is : how does the sign of @xmath0 make difference ?",
    "the answer is : if @xmath0 is positive ( negative ) the neutrino ( antineutrino ) undergoes the resonance . then , if the inverted mass hierarchy is the case and assuming the adiabaticity of h resonance , the @xmath21 which to be observed in terrestrial detectors comes from original @xmath22 in neutrinosphere .",
    "it is widely recognized that , due to their weaker interactions with surrounding matter , @xmath18 and @xmath22 are more energetic than @xmath23 and @xmath21 . since",
    "the @xmath21 induced cc reaction is the dominant reaction channel in water cherenkov detectors , the effect of such flavor transformation would be sensitively probed by them .",
    "we draw in fig .",
    "1 equal likelihood contours as a function of the heavy to light @xmath3 temperature ratio @xmath24 on the space spanned by @xmath25 temperature and total neutrino luminosity by giving the neutrino events from sn1987a .",
    "the data comes from kamiokande and imb experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition to it we introduce an extra parameter @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 which describes the departure from equipartition of energies to three neutrino species and examine the sensitivity of our conclusion against the change in @xmath26 .    0.5 cm -0.2 cm    0.5 cm 0.6 cm [ fig1 ]    at @xmath28 , that is at equal @xmath29 and @xmath30 temperatures , the 95 @xmath31 likelihood contour marginally overlaps with the theoretical expectation @xcite represented by the shadowed box in fig .",
    "1 . when the temperature ratio @xmath32 is varied from unity to 2 the likelihood contour moves to the left , indicating less and less consistency between the standard theoretical expectation and the observed feature of the neutrino events .",
    "this is simply because the observed energy spectrum of @xmath25 must be interpreted as that of the original one of @xmath33 in the presence of the msw effect in @xmath34 channel .",
    "it implies that the original @xmath25 temperature must be lower by a factor of @xmath32 than the observed one , leading to stronger inconsistency at larger @xmath32 .    the solid lines in fig .",
    "1 are for the case of equipartition of energy into three flavors , @xmath35 , whereas the dotted and the dashed lines are for @xmath36 and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "we observe that our result is very insensitive against the change in @xmath26 .",
    "we conclude that if the temperature ratio @xmath32 is in the range 1.4 - 2.0 as the sn simulations indicate , the inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses is disfavored by the neutrino data of sn1987a unless the h resonance is nonadiabatic , i.e. , unless @xmath37 a few @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the possibility that sn can tell about the sign of @xmath0 is , i think , interesting and in fact it is the unique available hint on the question at this moment .",
    "we , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , feel that our argument and the analysis done with the sn1987a data is reasonably robust .",
    "but , of course , it would be much nicer if we can have independent confirmation by terrestrial experiments .",
    "with regard to the cp violating effect mentioned in ( iii ) it appears , to my understanding , that the best place for its measurement is long ( @xmath39 10 km ) baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we develop an analytic method by which we can explore various regions of experimentally variable parameters to illuminate at where cp violating effects are large and how one can avoid serious matter effect contamination .",
    "actually we formulate below a perturbative framework to have a bird - eye view of at where the sign of @xmath0 is clearly displayed and the cp violating phase manifests itself .",
    "some of the earlier attempts to formulate perturbative treatment to explore the verious regions may be found in @xcite .",
    "we rewrite the schrdinger equation by using the basis @xmath40 defined by ( @xmath41 is a cp phase matrix ) @xmath42_{\\alpha\\beta } \\nu_{\\beta}$ ] , into the form @xmath43 where hamiltonian h contains the following three terms : @xmath44 + a(x ) \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } c_{13}^2 & 0 & c_{13}s_{13 } \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ c_{13}s_{13 } & 0 & s_{13}^2 \\end{array } \\right ] &   \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{\\delta_{12 } } { 2e } \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } s_{12}^2 & c_{12}s_{12 } & 0 \\\\ c_{12}s_{12 } & c_{12}^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{array } \\right]&. \\label { hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we first note the order of magnitude of a relevant quantity to observe the hierarchies of various terms in the hamiltonian : @xmath45 it may be compared with the matter potential @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes electron number density in the earth ; @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electron fraction .    in view of these results",
    "one can identify two typical cases , the high and low energy options with @xmath3 beam energies @xmath2 10 gev and @xmath2 100 mev , respectively , each with a hierarchy of energy scales :    \\(1 ) high energy option @xmath50    \\(2 ) low energy option @xmath51    now let us discuss the high and low energy options one by one .",
    "the focus will be on the sign of @xmath0 in the former and the cp violation in the latter .      in the high energy option",
    "one can formulate perturbation theory by regarding the 1st and the 2nd terms in the hamiltonian in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) as unperturbed part and the 3rd term as perturbation ; solar @xmath52 perturbation theory .",
    "the unperturbed system is essentially the two - flavor msw system and it is well known that it leads to the matter enhanced @xmath8 mechanism in neutrino ( if @xmath53 ) or antineutrino ( if @xmath13 ) channels .",
    "therefore , the high energy option is advantagious if @xmath8 is extremely small .    in leading",
    "order one can easily compute the oscillation probability in matter under the adiabatic approximation .",
    "it reads @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 where @xmath57 refers to antineutrino and neutrino channels , respectively .",
    "let us expand the oscillation probability by the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , it is a small parameter in most of the practical cases ; @xmath59 then , the oscillation probability reads to next to leading order as @xmath60 \\label { prob2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term in ( [ prob2 ] ) is identical with the vacuum oscillation probability @xmath61 under the small @xmath58 approximation .",
    "it is the simplest version of the vacuum mimicking mechanism discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where a much more extensive version including the cp ( or t ) violating piece is uncovered .",
    "if the measurement is done in both neutrino and antineutrino channel , one may obtain the difference @xmath62 if i use @xmath63 ev@xmath64 , @xmath65 for baseline @xmath66 km and energy @xmath67 gev since the first parencesis is of order unity in the high energy option .",
    "thus , the sign of @xmath68 is determined as the sign of @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "my next and the last message about the high energy option is that the cp violating effect is small . it is obvious in leading order that no cp violating effect is induced ; it is a two - flavor problem and hence there is no room for cp violation even in matter .",
    "therefore , we have to go beyond the leading order to have cp violation .",
    "then , the cp and t violating effect is always accompanied by the suppression factor @xmath70 which comes from the energy denominator .",
    "therefore , cp - odd effect is small in the high energy option . which will be achieved by neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "however , it appears that they are actually consistent because the sensitivity is in fact achieved by the cp conserving @xmath71 term not by the cp violating term in the oscillation probability at least for @xmath72 km @xcite . ]",
    "the high energy option is certainly advantagious for the determination of the sign of @xmath0 thanks to larger matter effects by available longer baseline due to better focusing of the @xmath3 beam .",
    "on the other hand , i will show that the low energy option is the natural place to look for genuine cp violation .    because of the hierarchy in the energy scale ( [ leoption ] ) , the first term in the hamiltonian in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is the unperturbed term and the matter and the @xmath5 terms are small perturbations .",
    "it is important to recognize that it is a degenerate perturbation theory because of the degeneracy in the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "then , one must first diagonalize the degenerate subspace to obtain _ zeroth order _ wave function and the first order correction to the energy eigenvalues . then",
    ", the zeroth order wave function contains the cp violating phase effect .",
    "this is the reason why the low energy option allows large cp violation unsuppressed by the hierarchical mass ratio @xmath73 , which is to my knowledge the unique case .    in this",
    "setting one can derive the oscillation probability @xmath74 as follows : @xmath75 \\sin^2 \\left ( \\xi_{le } \\frac{\\delta m^2_{12}l}{4e}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & - & 2j_m ( \\theta_{12}^m , \\delta ) \\sin \\left ( \\xi_{le } \\frac{\\delta m^2_{12}l}{2e}\\right ) \\label{prob3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the matter enhanced jarlskog factor .",
    "the probability ( [ prob3 ] ) represents , apart from the @xmath71 term which is small due to the factor @xmath78 , the vacuum mimicking mechanism in its most extensive form including the cp violating jarlskog term . to check",
    "how well the system mimics vacuum oscillations see ref @xcite .    the number of appearance events in water cherenkov detector for a beam energy e = 100 mev is estimated by assuming 10 times stronger @xmath19 flux at @xmath79 km than the k2k design flux ( despite lower energy ! ) and 100% conversion of @xmath19 to @xmath30 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the assumed flux at a detector at @xmath83 km and the design neutrino flux at sk in k2k experiment , respectively .",
    "the latter is approximately , @xmath84 @xmath85 where pot stands for proton on target .    to estimate the optimal distance we compute the expected number of events in neutrino and anti - neutrino channels as well as their ratios as a function of distance by taking into account of neutrino beam energy spread . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the average energy of neutrino beam @xmath86 = 100 mev and beam energy spread of gaussian type with width @xmath87 mev .",
    "we present our results in fig .",
    "1.4 cm    -0.7 cm 1.0 cm 0.6 cm [ fig2 ]    while this particular proposal may have several experimental problems it is sufficiantly illuminative of the fact that the low energy option is in principle more appropriate for experimental search for cp violating effect .",
    "there is a large cp violation and the matter effect is small or controllable .",
    "the remaining question is of course how to develop a feasible experimental proposal .",
    "a possibility which employs medium energy ( @xmath88 gev ) conventional @xmath3 beam is raised by an eminent experimentalist and triggered much interests @xcite .",
    "there were many debates between supporters of high and low energy options in the workshop .",
    "i have concluded with my personal best three flavor scenario ; we measure cp violation by low energy superbeam in japan , and you measure @xmath10 by neutrino factory in europe , and then let us compare the results !",
    "i express deep gratitude to g. l. fogli for cordial invitation to such a focused and the well - organized workshop , in which i was able to enjoy the stimulating atmosphere of the europian neutrino physics community .",
    "i thank hiroshi nunokawa for collaboration and his kind help in dealing with the elsevier latex format .",
