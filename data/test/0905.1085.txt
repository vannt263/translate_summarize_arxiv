    "interferometers with coherent light are one of the building blocks for high - precision metrology .",

    "<S> with photon - number resolving detectors , we show compression of interference fringes with increasing photon numbers for a fabry - prot interferometer . this feature provides a higher precision in determining the position of the interference maxima compared to a classical detection strategy . </S>",
