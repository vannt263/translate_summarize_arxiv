    "path integral quantization in the lagrangian formulation and canonical quantization in the hamiltonian formulation are two ways to quantize classical systems .",
    "the lagrangian formulation is suitable for numerical simulations on a computer via monte carlo .",
    "the enormous success of lattice gauge theory over the last two and half decades is due to the fact that the monte carlo method with importance sampling is an excellent technique to compute high dimensional ( and even ",
    "infinite \" dimensional ) integrals .    unfortunately , using the lagrangian formulation it is difficult to estimate wave functions and the spectrum of excited states .",
    "wave functions in conjunction with the energy spectrum contain more physical information than the energy spectrum alone .",
    "although lattice @xmath1 simulations in the lagrangian formulation give good estimates of the hadron masses , one is yet far from a comprehensive understanding of hadrons .",
    "let us take as example a new type of hardrons made of gluons , the so - called glueballs .",
    "lattice qcd calculations@xcite predict the mass of the lightest glueball with quantum number @xmath2 , to be @xmath3 . experimentally , there are at least two candidates : @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". the investigation of the glueball production and decays can certainly provide additional important information for experimental determination of a glueball .",
    "therefore , it is important to be able to compute the glueball wave function .    in the hamiltonian formulation ,",
    "one can obtain the ground state energy , but also wave functions and the spectrum of excited states . often , and in particular in the case of many - body systems ,",
    "it is difficult to solve the stationary schrdinger equation . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have suggested how to construct an effective hamiltonian via monte carlo , which allows to compute the low energy spectrum and the corresponding wave functions .",
    "the method has been tested in quantum mechanics in d=1,2 and 3 dimensions , for the free system , the harmonic oscillator and a number of other local potentials . in all cases ,",
    "the exact results were well reproduced @xcite .    if one wants to construct the monte carlo hamiltonian in the case of high dimensional systems or for many - body systems using a regular basis like in quantum mechanics , one runs into serious troubles .",
    "consider , e.g. a 1-d chain of @xmath6 spin @xmath7 particles .",
    "for @xmath8 , the dimension of hilbert space is @xmath9 , which is prohibitively large for numerical computations .",
    "a physical solution of this problem is the construction of a lower dimensional space but retaining the important degrees of freedom .",
    "this principle is realized , e.g. , is the folded diagram technique @xcite . in recent years",
    ", monte carlo methods have been widely used to solve problems in quantum physics .",
    "for example , with quantum monte carlo there has been improvement in nuclear shell model calculations @xcite . a proposal to solve the sign problem in monte carlo greens function method , useful for spin models has been made by sorello @xcite .",
    "lee et al .",
    "@xcite have suggested a method to diagonalize hamiltonians , via a random search of basis vectors having a large overlap with low - energy eigenstates .",
    "in contrast to that , in this work we construct a basis , matrix elements of the transition amplitude and hence the hamiltonian via the path integral starting from the action .",
    "we suggest an extension of the idea of the monte carlo hamiltonian with the purpose to treat many - body problems : we try to mimic the success of the monte carlo method with importance sampling when solving euclidean path integrals in the lagrangian formulation .",
    "there one constructs a ",
    "small \" number ( say 100 - 1000 ) of representative ( equilibrium ) configurations and computes the expectation value of an observable by summing the observable over those configurations . in close analogy to those equilibrium configurations we suggest here to use stochastically chosen representative basis states ( called stochastic basis in the following ) .",
    "this will allow us to construct an effective hamiltonian from transition matrix elements between those stochastic basis states .",
    "the goal is to solve the many - body problem by construction of the effective hamiltonian in such a  model space \" .",
    "one expects the dimension of the effective hamiltonian to be in the same order as the typical number of configurations ( 100 - 1000 ) used in computing path integrals in lattice field theory .",
    "we will present results showing that the effective hamiltonian in conjunction with a stochastic basis works in quantum mechanical many - body systems : as example we consider a chain of coupled harmonic anharmonic oscillators ( scalar @xmath10 model ) , and compute thermodynamical observables .",
    "we find that the monte carlo hamiltonian gives quite accurate results for the spectrum in a finite energy window , and also for thermodynamical observables like free energy , average energy , entropy and specific heat in a finite temperature window .",
    "let us briefly recall the meaning of the monte carlo hamiltonian @xcite . using feynman s path integral formulation @xcite , we consider the transition amplitude in imaginary time from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "using imaginary time makes the path integral mathematically well defined , and renders it amenable to numerical simulations by monte carlo .",
    "because the effective hamiltonian is time independent , its construction in imaginary time should give the same result as in real time .",
    "we consider the transition amplitudes for transitions between position states .",

    "the energy eigenvalues @xmath36 are obtained from the logarithm of the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath30 .",
    "this yields an effective hamiltonian , @xmath37",
    "it is evident that the above basis construction becomes prohibitively large if we intend to apply this to a system with many degrees of freedom ( many - body system ) .",
    "for such situations we desire to construct a small basis which gives an effective hamiltonian and reproduces well observables in a low - energy window .",
    "why should such a basis exist ?",
    "the heuristic argument is the euclidean path integral , which , when evaluated via monte carlo with importance sampling , gives a good answer for the transition amplitude .",
    "this is possible by taking into account a  small \" number of configurations ( e.g. in the order of 100 - 1000 ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "the configurations correspond to basis functions .",
    "thus we expect that suitably chosen basis functions exist , the number of which is in the order of 100 - 1000 , which yields a satisfactory effective low energy hamiltonian .",

    "how can we construct such a  small \" basis ?",
    "let us consider first the most simple case , i.e. , a free particle in @xmath46 dimension .",

    "we draw @xmath59 samples , giving @xmath59 states , where @xmath59 is considerably smaller than @xmath6 , the original size of the basis .",
    "let us give some thought to the question : is such probability density physically reasonable ?",
    "firstly , consider the case when @xmath51 is large .",
    "the boltzmann - gibbs distribution @xmath60\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] projects onto the ground state when @xmath61 . for the free system the ground state energy is @xmath62 .",
    "i.e. , the distribution @xmath63 has a strong peak at @xmath62 ( when @xmath61 ) . on the other hand , when @xmath61 , then @xmath64 given by eq.([eq : gaussian ] ) is large .",
    "thus the density @xmath53 , from which we draw the @xmath65 is a broad gaussian . in the limit @xmath66 , it becomes a uniform distribution .",
    "now we go over from @xmath53 to @xmath67 , related via fourier transformation . if @xmath53 is uniform , then @xmath68 .",
    "thus it gives the energy @xmath69 , which is the correct ground state energy eigenvalue .",
    "thus , in the extreme low - energy regime , the distribution @xmath53 gives a result consistent with the boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "this is a good indication that @xmath53 will generate an effective hamiltonian useful for the computation of thermodynamical observables .    although less relevant for our purpose , it is instructive to look what happens in the opposite situation , i.e. , when @xmath51 is small . in the limit @xmath70 ,",
    "the boltzmann - gibbs distribution is approximately a constant .",
    "all energies occur with equal probability .",
    "thus @xmath64 is also small .",
    "the distribution @xmath53 behaves like @xmath71 .",
    "the fourier transform yields @xmath72 const .",
    ", i.e. a uniform distribution",
    ". then @xmath73 is distributed like @xmath74 .",
    "this is not the same as the boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "but for small @xmath51 , which means large energy @xmath75 , it is qualitatively comparable to that of boltzmann - gibbs .",
    "next we ask : what do we do in the case when a local potential is present ?",
    "the definition of the probability density @xmath53 given by eq.([eq : probability ] ) generalizes to include also local potentials . in order to construct a stochastic basis one can proceed via the following steps : ( i ) compute the euclidean green s function @xmath76 , e.g. , by solving the diffusion equation and compute @xmath53 .",
    "( ii ) find an algorithm giving a random variable @xmath49 distributed according to the probability density @xmath53 and draw samples from this distribution , giving nodes , say @xmath65 . finally , one obtains the stochastic basis by constructing the corresponding characteristic states from the nodes @xmath65 .",
    "the above expression involves @xmath86 , i.e. the volume of the interval @xmath87 . in a 1-dimensional integral the intervals @xmath87 have to be chosen such that they cover the domain filled by the stochastic nodes .",
    "however , in higher dimensions this will be complicated .",
    "how should one choose then the volume of such  interval \" ?",
    "this can be answered by recalling how to compute an integral via monte carlo with importance sampling .",
    "@xmath88 suppose the nodes of integration @xmath89 are drawn from the distribution @xmath53 , normalized to unity .",
    "then the monte carlo estimator of @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 this tells us that the volume of the  intervals \" is given by @xmath92 the result holds in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional chain of @xmath93 coupled harmonic oscillators , with anharmonic perturbation .",

    "we have estimated the error propagation numerically .",
    "we have considered the matrix @xmath105 and diagonalized it and computed correspondingly @xmath106 via eqs.([eq : decompm],[eq : eigenvalvec ] ) .",
