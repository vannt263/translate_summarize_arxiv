    "the transformations have been determined independently on each detector chip in order to maximize the accuracy . at the end of the procedure , for each of the @xmath32 stars we have up to ten position measurements in the first epoch catalog and up to nineteen in the second epoch catalog . to determine the relative pms , we computed the mean x and y positions of each star in each epoch , adopting a @xmath36 clipping algorithm .",
    "the star pms are thus the difference between the mean x , y positions evaluated in the two epochs , divided by @xmath37 years .",
    "the resulting pms are in units of pixels @xmath38 .",
    "since the master frame is already oriented according to the equatorial coordinate system , the x - component of the pm corresponds to a projected pm along the ( negative ) ra and the y - component corresponds to a pm along the dec .",
    "therefore , we converted our pms in units of mas @xmath38 by multiplying the previous values for the acs pixel scale ( @xmath39 ) , and we named @xmath40 and @xmath41 the pms along the ra and dec directions , respectively . to maximize the quality of our results , we built a final pm catalog by taking into account only stars for which at least three position measurements are available in each epoch . at the end of the procedure we counted 4938 stars with measured pms .",
    "the errors in the position of the stars in each epoch ( @xmath42 ) have been calculated as the standard deviation of the measured positions around the mean value .",

    "for both the pm directions , the typical uncertainty for stars with @xmath44 is less of @xmath45 , demonstrating the good quality of our measurements .",

    "as can be seen , the vpd is dominated by two prominent features : the clump in the center with zero relative pm is , by definition , dominated by the cluster population , while the elongated sparse distribution of points extending beyond this clump is dominated by contaminating field stars , mostly from the galactic disk . at first inspection of the vpd",
    "we can see that only @xmath48 of the @xmath32 analyzed stars are likely cluster members .",
    "a high percentage of field contamination is indeed expected in the case of m71 , since it has a quite low stellar density and is located in a crowded field at low galactic latitudes . by selecting in the vpd the likely cluster members ( i.e. the stars with relative pm around 0 both in ra and in dec ) we find that the mean motion is @xmath49 with a standard deviation of @xmath50 both in @xmath19 and in @xmath20 , thus , as expected , consistent with zero .    the effect of decontaminating the cmd from field stars is shown in figure [ cmdmoti ] , where we have separated the objects with pm@xmath51 ( likely cluster members ) , from those with larger pms . the selection of stars in the vpd is shown , per bins of one magnitude , in the left - hand column of the figure , with the objects having pm@xmath52 encircled in red . the effect on the cmd",

    "it is well appreciable the main sequence of the galactic field .",
    "instead , the decontaminated cmd clearly shows a sharp and well defined main sequence , also revealing the binary sequence .",
    "the few stars on the blue side of the main sequence could be cluster exotic objects , such as cataclysmic variables , x - ray binaries or millisecond pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a main sequence companion star is heated by a compact object .",
    "nonetheless , we can not completely rule out the possibility that some of these stars are field objects with pms compatible with those of the cluster members .",
    "to transform the relative pms into absolute ones , we used background galaxies as reference , since they have negligible pms due to their large distances .",
    "this method has been successfully used in several previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , the nasa extragalactic database report no sources in the fov used for the pm estimate .",
    "thus , we carefully inspected our images in order to search for diffuse galaxy - like objects .",
    "we found four galaxies with central point - like structure and relative high brightness , which allowed us to precisely determine their centroid position .",
    "although many other galaxies are present in the fov , they have no point - like structure or are too faint to allow the determination of a reasonable pm value .",
    "moreover , as part of a project aimed at searching for optical counterparts to x - ray sources , we identified two promising active galactic nuclei ( agn ) candidates .",
    "two chandra x - ray sources , named s05 and s41 in @xcite , have high energy and optical properties that can be attributed either to agns or to cataclysmic variables ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more details ) .",
    "in order to distinguish between these two possibilities , we analyzed their pms .",
    "we reported our relative pm reference frame to the absolute cluster pm ( @xmath53 ) previously determined by @xcite and found that these two sources have an absolute pm significantly different from the cluster motion and compatible with zero .",
    "we therefore conclude that these two objects are likely background agns and add them to the list of objects used to determine our reference absolute zero point .",
    "the six selected objects are located very close to each other in the vpd , as expected for extragalactic objects , and their finding charts are shown in figure [ charts ] .",
    "we defined the absolute zero point as the weighted mean of their relative pms and assumed as error the uncertainty on the calculated mean . by anchoring this mean position to the ( 0,0 ) mas @xmath54 value",
    ", we find that the absolute pm of m71 is : @xmath55 this value is in good agreement with ( but more accurate than ) the previous determination @xcite , and it remains unchanged within the errors even if the two candidate agns are excluded from the analysis : in that case we get : @xmath56 , still in agreement with the previous results .",
    "the vpd in the absolute frame is plotted in figure [ motiass ] , with the red and green crosses and circles marking , respectively , the absolute pm and its uncertainty as determined in this study and as quoted in @xcite .",
    "confidence region .",
    "the values previously determined in the literature @xcite are marked with a green cross and a green circle .",
    "the red cross centered on the elongated structure is centered on the field mean pm.,width=321 ]    since every absolute pm measurement is strictly dependent on the accuracy of the absolute reference frame , we need to verify the possible presence of systematic errors in its determination .",
    "one of the possible source of systematic errors is the rotation of the gc on the plane of the sky . indeed , since we used only cluster stars to define the relative reference frame , if the gc is rotating , then our frame will be rotating too .",
    "this would introduce an artificial rotation to background and foreground objects around the cluster center . to quantify this possible effect we followed the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we selected a sample of field stars as those that in the vpd of figure  [ motirel ] have relative pms larger than @xmath57 .",
    "then we decomposed their pm vectors into a radial and tangential component with respect to the cluster center .",
    "if the gc is rotating , we would expect to find a clear dependence of the pm tangential component on the distance from the cluster center .",
    "such a dependence is however excluded by our results , thus that the internal regions of m71 are not rotating , in agreement with the recent findings by @xcite .",
    "we also compared the field star motion to that expected from theoretical galactic models in the analyzed fov . to evaluate the field mean motion , we followed the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "first , we excluded the stars within @xmath58 from the cluster mean motion .",
    "then we iteratively removed field stars in a symmetric position with respect to the gc exclusion region and evaluated the weighted mean motion by applying a @xmath36 algorithm .",
    "we found @xmath59 .",
    "we compared these values with those predicted for the same region of the sky in the besanon galactic model @xcite , simulating a sample of @xmath60 artificial stars distant up to 15 kpc from the galactic center , in a fov centered on m71 , covering a solid angle of @xmath61 , and having v magnitudes ranging 12 from to 25 .",
    "the predicted field mean motion is @xmath62 , in good agreement with our results .",
    "the gc absolute pm , combined with the radial velocity @xmath63 km s@xmath64 from @xcite , can be used to determine 3d space velocity of the cluster in a cartesian galactocentric rest frame .",
    "using the formalism described in @xcite , assuming the local standard of rest velocity equal to @xmath65 @xcite and using the value of the sun velocity with respect to it from @xcite , we obtained @xmath66 , where the major source of uncertainty is the gc absolute pm error .",

    "@xmath67 , to reconstruct its orbit in the axisymmetric potential discussed in @xcite , which has been extensively used to study the kinematics of galactic stellar systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the orbit was time - integrated backwards , starting from the current conditions and using a second - order leapfrog integrator ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) with a small time step of @xmath68 kyr .",
    "since the adopted galactic potential is static , we choose to back - integrate the orbit only for 3 gyr , since longer backward integrations become uncertain due to their dependence on the galactic potential variations as a function of time .",
    "this numerical integration required about 32000 steps and reproduced @xmath69 complete cluster orbits .",
    "the errors on the conservation of the energy and the z - component of the angular momentum never exceeded one part over @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "we generated a set of 1000 clusters starting from the phase - space initial conditions normally distributed within the uncertainties .",
    "for all of these clusters we repeated the backward time integration .",
    "figure  [ orbit ] shows the resulting cluster orbits in the equatorial and meridional galactocentric plane .",
    "as can be seen , the cluster has a low - latitude disk - like orbit within the galactic disk . indeed in the equatorial plane it reaches a maximum distance of @xmath72 kpc from the galactic center and a minimum distance of @xmath73 kpc .",
    "thus , it orbits around the assumed spheroidal bulge , never crossing it .",
    "moreover , it persists on a low - latitude orbit , with a typical height from the galactic plane of about @xmath74 kpc , thus again confined within the disk .",
    "the estimated orbits indicate that , at least during the last 3 gyr , m71 tightly interacted with the inner galactic disk . with respect to the large majority of galactic gcs , which are on large orbits across the ( low - density ) halo ,",
    "these interactions likely induced heavy mass - loss @xcite in m71 , thus supporting the possibility that it lost a significant fraction of its initial mass , as already suggested by its flat mass function @xcite .",

    "* ) , in order to re - evaluate the structural parameters of m71 we used direct star counts . the determination of the stellar density profile ( number of stars per unit area , in a series of concentric annuli around @xmath75 ) has been performed following the procedure fully described in @xcite . also in this case , in order to minimize the differential reddening effect we used the near - infrared wircam data , which covers distances out to @xmath88 from @xmath75 in the south - west portion of the cluster ( see fig .",

    "the projected stellar density in each annulus is the mean of the values measured in each sub - sector and the uncertainty has been estimated from the variance among the sub - sectors . the stellar background has been estimated by averaging the outermost values , where the profile flattens , and it has been subtracted to the observed distribution to obtain decontaminated density profiles . the result is shown in figure [ profwircam ] .",
    "the cluster structural parameters has been derived by fitting the observed density profiles with a spherical , isotropic , single - mass @xcite model .. the single - mass approximation is justified by the fact that the magnitude range chosen to build the profile includes cluster stars with negligible mass differences .",
    "the best - fit model results in a cluster with a king dimensionless potential @xmath90 , a core radius @xmath91 arcsec , a half - mass radius @xmath92 arcsec , a truncation radius @xmath93 arcsec and , thus , a concentration parameter , defined as the logarithm of the truncation to the core radius , @xmath94 .",

    "this implies that the structural parameters quoted in the literature ( which are determined from the light of the most luminous giants only ) are not representative of the overall cluster profile .",
    "the availability of a very wide ( @xmath28 ) sample at optical wavelengths ( the megacam dataset ) with an analogous level of completeness ( comparable to the acs one for @xmath99 ) allowed us to investigate how the derivation of the cluster stellar number density profile from optical observations can be affected by the presence of large differential extinction .",
    "figure [ mapred ] compares the extinction map and the 2d density map of the @xmath100 region of the sky centered on m71 .",

    "the result is plotted in figure [ profmega ] and shows that , indeed , the stuctural parameters of the best - fit king model turn out to be very different from those obtained from the near - infrared ( almost reddening - unaffected ) dataset ( compare with fig .

    "although this method has been developed specifically for open clusters , it can be used also in the case of m71 , since its current mass ( @xmath110 ; from @xcite ) and orbit are consistent with those typical of open clusters ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar implementation of this procedure ) .",
    "the initial mass @xmath111 of the cluster can be expressed as follows : @xmath112^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma } } \\left [    1-q_{ev}(t)\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is the cluster current mass , @xmath114 gyr is the cluster age @xcite , @xmath115 is the dissolution time - scale parameter , @xmath116 is a dimensionless index and @xmath117 is a function describing the mass - loss due to stellar evolution . the dissolution time - scale parameter is a constant describing the mass - loss process , which depends on the strength of the tidal field .",
    "small values of @xmath115 are typically associated with encounters with molecular clouds and spiral arms , while larger values are used to describe the effect of the galactic tidal field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since m71 has an orbit and a structure quite similar to those of open clusters , we assumed @xmath115 in the same range of values ( @xmath118 myr ) constrained in @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath116 depends on the cluster initial density distribution and is usually constrained by the value of the king dimensionless potential @xmath119 .",

    "the function @xmath117 , which describes the mass - loss process due to stellar evolution , can be approximated by the following analytical expression : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 are coefficients that depend on the cluster metallicity .",

    "the resulting initial mass of the cluster is shown in figure [ mini ] as a function of the explored range of values of @xmath115 .",
    "it varies between 1.8 and @xmath130 , which are all values typical of the mass of galactic halo gcs , and is one order of magnitude ( or more ) larger than the current mass . also considering the largest possible value of @xmath115 ( @xmath131 myr ;",
    "see @xcite ) , we find that the cluster initial mass is at least twice its current value . clearly , this estimate is based on a simplified approach and on parameters derived by the average behaviors of open clusters , and different assumptions may lead to different results . however , it is interesting to note that , while such a high mass loss would be unlikely for a halo gc , it can be reasonable for a system moving along an orbit confined within the disk ( see sect .",

    "it turned out that , at least during the last 3 gyr , m71 has been in a disk - like orbit confined within the galactic disk . it therefore seems reasonable to suppose that m71 suffered a number of dynamical processes ( e.g. , with the dense surrounding environment , the milky way spiral arms , various molecular clouds ) that made it lose an amount of mass significantly larger than what expected for the majority of galactic gcs , which are on halo - like orbits . we re - determined the gravitational center and density profile of m71 by using resolved star counts from a wide - field near - infrared catalog obtained with wircam at the cfht . this allowed us to minimize the impact of the large and differential reddening affecting the system .",

    "since this latter depends on the cluster central luminosity density and core radius ( @xmath137 ; @xcite ) , we have re - evaluated it by using the newly determined structural parameters . by adopting the central surface brightness quoted in @xcite and equation ( 4 ) in @xcite , we found @xmath138 ( in units of @xmath139/pc@xmath140 ) . from this quantity and",

    "an accurate investigation of the possible presence of tidal tails around the cluster would be important to confirm such a significant mass - loss from the system .",
