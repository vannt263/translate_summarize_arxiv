    "the remnants of many supernova explosions are bright x - ray sources , with their soft x - ray spectra showing strong metal emission lines , and characteristic temperatures ranging from below 1kev up to a few kev .",
    "thanks to their high x - ray luminosity and their complex spectra , they have been a frequent target for spectroscopic x - ray observations . of particular interest are the remnants in which the ejected remains of the parent supernova are visible in the optical and are recognizable from their very high metal abundance , a class for which the cas  a remnant is often considered the prototype .",
    "x - ray emission is in these systems modeled as being due to two distinct plasma components , i.e.   the ejecta from the supernova explosion , heated to x - ray temperatures by the reverse shock , and the shocked surrounding circumstellar medium ( csm ) , heated by the forward shock ploughing through it . in this simplified view , the two components are expected to have different characteristics , with the ejecta very metal rich , and with abundance values reflecting the results of the nucleosynthesis which took place in the supernova progenitor as well as in the explosion itself . at the same time , the emission from the shocked csm should show abundance values resulting from a mix of the interstellar medium and of the stellar wind from the progenitor .",
    "analysis of the x - ray spectrum can thus be used to derive an estimate of the mass of the shocked material , for both emission components , as well as the metal abundance and the mass fraction of each element in the ejecta .",
    "these parameters can be used to directly verify models of nucleosynthesis in supernova progenitors .    given the young age of the cas  a remnant ( @xmath2yr ) the shocked plasma is not expected to have reached ionization equilibrium , and indeed it is by now accepted that the x - ray emission of supernova remnants is better modeled with non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma emission codes than with codes modeling the emission of a plasma in collisional equilibrium .",
    "at the same time , hard x - ray emission of non - thermal origin has been detected in some of these remnants , extending to energies of @xmath3kev .",
    "such a hard x - ray tail is of course of astrophysical interest by itself , and it is also important since it contributes to the soft x - rays , thus biasing the interpretation of the thermal emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray satellite bepposax ( @xcite ) includes four co - aligned narrow field instruments , with complementary energy band coverage , ranging from 0.1 to @xmath4kev : the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs , @xcite ) , the three medium energy concentrator spectrometers ( mecs , @xcite ) , the high - pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc , @xcite ) and the phoswich detector system ( pds , @xcite ) .",
    "given both its astrophysical interest , and its usefulness as a calibration source , cas  a was included as a target in the science verification phase ( svp ) of the bepposax program . during the svp cas  a was observed at different times . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the spatially - integrated broad - band spectrum of cas  a , obtained using all the narrow - field instruments on board the bepposax satellite . in the present paper",
    "the lecs data have been used to cover the spectral range 0.58.0kev , the mecs data the range 1.510kev , the hpgspc data the range 5.030kev and the pds data the range 2080kev . while the lecs is sensitive down to 0.1kev",
    ", interstellar absorption is such that no source flux is detected below @xmath0kev .",
    "the cas  a remnant is several arcmin in size , and thus is , at the resolution of the lecs and mecs detectors ( @xmath5arcmin ) , an extended source . in the present paper",
    "however only the spatially integrated spectrum of the remnant is discussed .",
    "the data analysis was performed using the sron spex package , following an approach similar to the one adopted by @xcite  vkb in the following  who analyzed the cas  a x - ray spectrum from the asca sis .",
    "the source spectrum was modeled by two distinct nei components , one representing the emission from the ejecta , the other from the shocked csm . in our model",
    "the csm component is assumed to be the hotter one , and the emission from the ejecta is modeled as the cooler component of the spectrum .",
    "in addition , a third component is used , in the form of a power - law , to model the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the power - law component is assumed to extend across the whole x - ray spectrum , i.e. no cut - off was imposed .",
    "the distance to the snr was assumed to be 3.4kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the current residual absolute calibration uncertainties of the various bepposax instruments , the relative normalization of the different data sets has been considered as a free parameter , using the mecs normalization as reference . in practice",
    "the lecs and pds normalizations agree well with each other , as do the mecs and hpgspc ones .",
    "the lecs / pds normalization is @xmath6% lower than the mecs / hpgspc one , in agreement with the values found for other svp sources .",

    "+    given the complexity of the model we have used and thus the large number of parameters , not all the parameters can be derived from the data by a blind fitting procedure .",
    "some choices have been made a priori based on the current physical understanding of the source .",
    "the parent supernova is thought to be a helium star , which had shed all of its hydrogen envelope , and indeed the optical spectrum of the ejecta indicates that they are essentially devoid of hydrogen and rich in oxygen .",
    "we simulate this , in our ejecta model , by imposing a very high , fixed oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen , and thus determining the abundance of the other elements _ relative to o_. the o abundance has been fixed to 10@xmath14 times solar , but the results are not sensitive to the precise value used ( i.e. a value of 10@xmath15 or 10@xmath16 would yield very similar results ) . for the ejecta component , in addition to the normalization , the post - shock temperature and the ionization time , the abundance of all individual elements ( ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , ni ) is initially left free to vary .",
    "one additional parameter is the abundance of the lighter elements relative to oxygen .",
    "he , c and n have no measurable line emission due to the strong absorption , yet the value of their abundance ( specially c ) in the ejecta is important because they contribute to the continuum emission .",
    "thus , more carbon yields a higher continuum and thus lower abundance for the other elements . therefore it is necessary to fix the he , c and n abundance for the fit to some `` reasonable '' value .",
    "our choice has been to use the he / c and o / c values derived from models of nucleo - synthesis in supernovae , and in particular the models of @xcite .    for the csm component , in addition to the normalization , the post - shock temperature and the ionization time",
    ", we have left the _ global _ abundance free to vary , i.e.",
    "we have assumed that the abundance ratios of elements heavier than n in the shocked csm are well modeled by solar values .",
    "the abundance values of he and n were fixed to 10 times the solar value , an estimate in line with optical observations of the emission from the shocked csm ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies a depletion of h in the csm , so that the global abundance of the csm is expected to be non - solar due the influence of the strong stellar wind in the late stages of the progenitor star s life .",
    "the two - component nei plus power - law model discussed above provides a good fit to the observed spectrum across a broad range of energies , i.e. from 0.5 to 80kev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] . given the high signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra used , the uncertainties are likely to be dominated by systematic effects , as for example uncertainties in the ( relative ) calibration of the various detectors . in particular",
    "there is some energy - dependent effective - area inconsistency between the lecs and mecs data ( likely linked to the extended nature of the source ) , which is evident around the fek complex .",
    "additionally , there is evidence for some residual features in the hpgspc spectrum around @xmath17kev , which is likely to be due to residuals in the background subtraction .",
    "the resulting  of the fit , at 1160 with 382 degrees of freedom is formally not acceptable .",
    "however , given the large residual systematics , the nominal  per se can not be used as a measure of the acceptability of the model .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : fitpar ] , while the derived ejecta mass for each species is listed in table  [ tab : mass ] .    while the fit supplies a good phenomenological description of the data some of the best fit parameters are rather peculiar .",
    "most striking are the high ni abundance and the zero ne abundance . while ne has been found to be under - abundant in the optical ( @xcite ) and x - ray ( vkb ) , the ne - k lines fall in the same energy range where the rich fe - l and ni - l line complexes are , so that , at the limited energy resolution of non - dispersive spectrographs , it is difficult to disentangle real ne abundance effects from , for example , modeling problems .",
    "the same applies to the ni abundance , which is derived exclusively from the l - shell line complex , which is modeled , in spex , somewhat inconsistently with respect to the fe - l complex .",
    "the separate contribution of the three components to the cas  a broad band x - ray spectrum is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : decon ] .",
    "the power - law component dominates at the higher energies ( @xmath18kev ) , but it also gives a sizable contribution to the continuum emission at the lower energies , being for example comparable in intensity to the thermal continuum near the fek complex .",
    "such an additional continuum clearly influences the derived metal abundances , in particular making them higher with respect for example to vkb .",
    "possible explanations for the high - energy tail include ( 1 ) synchrotron radiation from shock - accelerated electrons with energies of several tens of tev , similar to the model proposed for sn1006 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) non - thermal bremsstrahlung from electrons with energies of several tens of kev , which have just been accelerated from the tail of the thermal distribution , the so called injection spectrum ; ( 3 ) an additional thermal component .",
    "some of our results depend on the underlying assumptions . modeling",
    "the tail as a power - law extending down to the lowest energies ( as it was done here ) is correct if the tail arises from a physically separate emission component such as synchrotron radiation .",
    "if the emission mechanism is however non - thermal bremsstrahlung the high energy photons arise from the non - maxwellian tail of the overall electron distribution , so that the power - law model will only be a good representation of the emission above @xmath1915kev . in this case",
    "the best fit abundances would be too high and the estimated normalizations of the thermal bremsstrahlung too low .",
    "furthermore , non - thermal electrons can also contribute to the line emission .",
    "also , possible contribution of @xmath20ti at 68kev and 78kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ) to our last bin may alter our best fit model .",
    "the model for the x - ray emission of the cas  a remnant discussed here follows a similar approach to vkb , with the addition of a power - law component which dominates at the higher energies .",
    "some of the vkb asca sis derived parameters are somewhat puzzling , specially when compared to predictions from theoretical models of nucleo - synthesis .",
    "for example , the ejecta appear to be quite deficient in their ne and mg abundances , with a mass fraction one order of magnitude lower than expected from nucleo - synthesis models ( @xcite ) .",
    "the same is true for the fe abundance , which again is lower by almost one order of magnitude .    assuming that the power - law component ( which was not used by vkb in their analysis ) really is a physically separate component of the spectrum",
    ", it significantly influences the mass estimates for the ejecta , because of differences in the estimated abundances as well as in the emission measure . for most elements",
    "the derived abundance estimates relative to o increase , when the power - law component is added , by a factor of about 3 , with the exception of ne and ni ( as discussed above ) , with the mass estimates correspondingly decreasing by @xmath21% with respect to an analysis using only the two nei components .",
    "the apparent lack of ne and mg in the ejecta still stands",
    ". the swept - up mass decreases ( with respect to vkb ) from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , while the ejecta mass decreases from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . the lower derived ejecta mass does not alter the general conclusion of vkb that the progenitor of cas a was a star of low mass ( i.e. which had lost most of its mass ) .",
    "some of the assumptions made in the analysis are derived from a priori considerations about the physics of the remnant , and have therefore to be critically assessed .",
    "changes in the assumption may lead to changes in the derived parameters .",
    "the two perhaps most critical assumptions are ( 1 ) the temperature structure of the thermal emission components and ( 2 ) the nature and thus precise spectral shape , specially at the lower energies , of the hard tail component .",
    "the consequence of these assumptions on the interpretation of the x - ray emission from the remnant will be examined in a future paper , in which we will also make use of spatially resolved spectroscopy in order to study if different components originate from distinct regions ."
