    "spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) produces plenty of fascinating effects in solids which provide broad possibilities for spin current generation and spin manipulation  @xcite .",
    "a noteworthy feature of these effects is that in many cases the soi acting in the bulk of the sample gives rise to effects which manifest themselves near the boundaries and interfaces with other media .",
    "it is enough to mention the following phenomena : ( i ) spin hall effect  @xcite , where the spin current produced by an electric current gives rise to the spin accumulation at side boundaries ; ( ii ) anomalous hall effect  @xcite , where a transverse voltage is generated by electrical current in spin polarized medium in the absence of external magnetic field ; ( iii ) equilibrium edge spin currents in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems  @xcite and edge spin accumulation  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the boundary effects has motivated us to study electronic states appearing at the heterointerfaces in the presence of sois .",
    "the interface states in the systems without sois have been widely investigated using different approaches such as the envelope - function method , tight - binding and first - principle calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of sois the interface states are not well studied yet , though this issue attracts now growing interest stimulated by rapid progress in the studies of topological insulators .",
    "topological insulators are considered to be a new state of solids with inverted conduction and valence bands and strong soi .",
    "@xcite the electron spectrum of topological insulators is characterized by the presence of edge or surface gapless states lying in the energy gap of bulk states .",
    "an essential property of the topological states is their chiral spin texture , due to which these states are protected against the scattering and robust to the variation of system parameters and boundary conditions .    the present paper aims to study the interface states in 2d electron systems with heterogeneous soi , such as a contact of 2d regions with the sois of different kind or strength . specifically , we consider contacts of regions with the rashba and dresselhaus sois and contacts of 2d regions with the soi and the normal 2d electron gas without soi .",
    "interface states are studied within envelope - function approach with using generalized boundary conditions and an effective interface potential .",
    "we restrict ourselves by one - band model which is commonly used for 2d electron gas with soi , in contrast to the case of topological insulators where at least two bands are to be taken into account to describe the edge states .",
    "nevertheless , we find that in this system the interface states exist which are similar to the edge states in 2d topological insulators as regards chiral spin texture , but they are more sensitive to boundary conditions .",
    "depending on the parameters ( such as the ratio of effective masses in adjacent regions and the band - bottom offset at the interface ) the energy of these states can lie either in the forbidden band or in the conduction band for bulk states or in both bands .",
    "an interesting result is that the interface states exist even if the interface potential equals zero .",
    "having analyzed conditions under which the interface states exist , we conclude that in 2d systems with heterogeneous sois there are the interface states that appear due to the bulk properties .",
    "the dependence of the interface - state spectra on the parameters of the effective interfacial potential is studied within a model , in which the potential contains two components : a spin - independent component and a component arising from the soi at the interface .",
    "the first component is shown to produce an energy shift of the spin - split dispersion curves , while the soi component considerably changes the dispersion - curve form and the spin polarization of the states .",
    "we study also the interface states in a 2d strip of finite width and find that the spatial overlap between the interface states at opposite edges of the strip essentially affects the spectrum , in addition to the usual size quantization effect . as a consequence of this effect the interface - state spectrum splits into two bands , the bottom of the lower band changing non - monotonically with the strip width .",

    "the main difference between the spectra of the interface states in the strip structures and in the single rsoi / dsoi contact , lies in the splitting of the interface - state band into two subbands with different distributions of the electron density across the strip .",

    "the lower subband bottom @xmath148 decreases with increasing @xmath150 until @xmath153 .",
    "this is trivially explained by the decrease of the kinetic energy .",
    "however , @xmath148 unexpectedly grows as @xmath154 .    to interpret such a behavior of the quantized energy",
    "let us take into consideration the fact that the electron density is redistributed across the strip with increasing @xmath150 as shown the insets in fig .",
    "[ drdwidth ] .",
    "the electron density in the lower subband is redistributed from the center to the edges .",
    "as it has been discussed above , electrons gain energy near the interface because of the mutual action of the sois in the two regions . in the case of the strip",
    ", there is an additional energy gain caused by the joint effect of two interfaces .",
    "this energy gain decreases with increasing @xmath150 because the interface states overlap less .",
    "it is for that reason @xmath148 grows with @xmath150 . in the case of the upper subband",
    "this effect is much smaller since the electron density in these states is always concentrated closer to the edges .",
    "it is worth noting that this effect results in essential lowering of the interface - state energy down to the forbidden band as compared with the case of a single interface .",
    "this unusual behavior of the quantization energy can manifest itself in the formation of localized states in quantum constrictions whose width varies slowly with the longitudinal distance .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the interface states exist at a boundary between regions with different sois in 2d electron systems and studied their spectra and spin texture .",
    "depending on the system parameters , the energy of these states can lie either in forbidden or the conduction band , or in both bands .",
    "an unexpected result is that the interface states arise even if the effective potential of the interface equals zero .",
    "the interface states are similar to the edge states in 2d topological insulators since they have chiral spin texture and are determined by the bulk properties of materials , such as the soi strengths and the effective mass ratio .    in view of the interest to the robustness of the topological edge states , the persistence of the interface states found here within an one - band model for variation of the boundary conditions has been explored .",
    "we have studied the effect of the interfacial potential , which has two components : spin - dependent and spin - independent ones .",
    "the latter component does not qualitatively affect the interface - state spectrum , while the spin - dependent component changes the states essentially as this potential exceeds a critical value .",
    "the persistence of the interface states for smoothing of the boundary was also investigated .",
    "we studied the system in which the soi strength changes smoothly in the transition layer between the regions with different sois and found that the interface states survive if the transition layer width @xmath155 is small compared to the characteristic length of the soi , @xmath156 . with increasing layer width the energy interval where the interface states are located diminishes and finally the states disappear .",
    "thus , we conclude that the interface states in the system with heterogeneous soi are less robust than the edge states in 2d topological insulators . in addition , their spectrum contains four states in the forbidden band at a given energy and hence there are more possibilities for scattering .    in realistic systems",
    "the sois of the rashba and dresselhaus types often act simultaneously and therefore it is expedient to explore this situation .",
    "when both types of the soi are present the electron spectrum becomes anisotropic in the wavevector space , giving rise to interesting effects .",
    "@xcite particularly , in the case where @xmath145 , the soi is effectively suppressed for electrons moving along the [ 110 ] direction in a zinc - blende crystal .",
    "the detailed study of the interface states in 2d systems with both sois is beyond the scope of the present publication .",
    "here we restrict ourselves by a brief discussion of results obtained for the contact of the ( r+d)soi region with normal electron gas .",
    "the joint action of the rashba and dresselhaus sois turns out to always reduce the energy depth of the interface states below the bottom of the bulk continuum states , the effects of the rashba and dresselhaus sois being not completely balanced at any ratio of @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "the interface state energy depends on the orientation of the interface line .",
    "the maximum energy depth of the interface states is reached when the boundary is parallel to the [ 110 ] direction . for any orientation of the boundary , there is such a ratio of @xmath157 to @xmath158 at which the interface state energy intersects the conduction band bottom . in the particular case where @xmath159 , below the conduction band bottom the interface states are absent .",
    "there is another effect close to that considered in this paper .",
    "it consists in the existence of the edge spin currents in 2d systems with heterogeneous soi .",
    "the mechanism of the edge spin currents is caused by the spin - dependent scattering of bulk electrons on the interface  @xcite .",
    "these currents also exist under the equilibrium .",
    "the estimations show that the spin current of the interface states studied here is small compared to scattering spin current if the fermi energy lies higher than @xmath25 above the conduction band bottom . in opposite case ,",
    "the interface - state spin current is prevailing , especially when the fermi level lies in the forbidden band .",

    "<S> interface states at a boundary between regions with different spin - orbit interactions ( sois ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems are investigated within the one - band effective mass method with generalized boundary conditions for envelope functions . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the interface states unexpectedly exist even if the effective interface potential equals zero . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the system parameters , the energy of these states can lie in either or both forbidden and conduction bands of bulk states . </S>",
    "<S> the interface states have chiral spin texture similar to that of the edge states in 2d topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> however , their energy spectrum is more sensitive to the interfacial potential , the largest effect being produced by the spin - dependent component of the interfacial potential . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the size quantization of the interface states in a strip of 2d electron gas with soi and found an unusual ( non - monotonic ) dependence of the quantization energy on the strip width . </S>"
