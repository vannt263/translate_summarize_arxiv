    "how does the environment of a galaxy influence its evolution ? finding an answer to this question requires extensive comparisons between galaxies in different environments , including those in the most isolated environments .",
    "many studies have sought to compare the global star formation properties of galaxies in field and cluster environments ( see , for example , references in koopmann & kenney 2004a and a review by poggianti 2005 ) .",
    "the selection of isolated comparison samples in these studies is as important as the selection of the primary objects of study . in the case of a study on environmental effects",
    ", the comparison sample should ideally be made up of galaxies completely isolated from their surroundings .",
    "however , the distribution of galaxies in space appears to be strongly clustered , with few , if any , objects outside gravitationally associated structures",
    ". a truly isolated galaxy may not exist ( e.g. , vettolani _ et al . _",
    "1986 , tully 1987b ) .",
    "all is not lost , however . the main requirement for a galaxy to serve as a comparison object in a study of the environmental effects on bright cluster galaxies is that it have a low probability of interaction with another galaxy of similar mass or with a group environment over a hubble time .",
    "such galaxies are not typical ( since 69% of galaxies are located in groups ; tully 1987b ) , but they do exist .",
    "we undertook to observe a sample of isolated galaxies as part of a study to compare the star formation properties of nearly 100 bright isolated and virgo cluster spiral galaxies via broadband r and h@xmath0 images .",
    "we sought the most isolated nearby galaxies for our comparison sample , using the environmental information in the nearby galaxies catalog ( tully 1987a , hereafter nbg ) . because we wished to compare virgo and isolated spirals as a function of hubble type classification , we selected our sample based on hubble type as well as local galaxy density , observing roughly equal numbers of different spiral types , with luminosities , distances , and inclinations as similar as possible to those of virgo spirals .",
    "we use the term ` isolated ' for this sample rather than the more general term ` field ' .",
    "the selection of field samples is generally not subject to the stringent requirements outlined here , and many field galaxy samples contain group members .    since our primary motivation was to find an isolated sample suitable for comparison to virgo cluster galaxies , our selection process was somewhat different from that of other studies which have sought to identify and characterize the most isolated galaxies .",
    "studies such as karachentseva ( 1973 ) and pisano , wilcotts , & liu ( 2002 ) apply more stringent density limitations , but their samples contain relatively few early - type spiral galaxies and are on average further away .",
    "we note that much larger samples of isolated galaxies are being compiled through studies such as allam _",
    "et al . _  ( 2005 ) , who identify a sample of 2980 isolated galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) data release 1 .",
    "the galaxies identified in this survey are on average at much greater distance than virgo , but the sample contains a significant number of early - type galaxies .",
    "a dilemma in selecting isolated galaxies for comparison was deciding whether or not to select only galaxies which had previous measurements at other wavelengths .",
    "for example , it would be useful to have a comparison sample of galaxies also mapped in hi and co. however ,",
    "we decided that such a selection criterion might bias the sample , since galaxies with mapped hi and co were often selected because of their peculiarities .",
    "our final sample contains rather obscure galaxies , but we hope that this will be changed in the future by further observations of these galaxies .    in this paper , we present images and radial profiles in h@xmath0 and r for 29 isolated spiral galaxies .",

    "[ select ] an isolated comparison sample of galaxies should resemble the cluster sample as much as possible in distance and absolute magnitude , but be located in the lowest density regions possible .",

    "were selected .",
    "the luminosity cutoff was set to the same as that of the virgo cluster sample : m@xmath1 -18 .",
    "the local density , distance , and recessional velocity limits were determined by experimentation to obtain sufficient numbers of early - type spirals , which are less common in field environments . to select galaxies with distances comparable to virgo , a cutoff in velocity of 2500 km s@xmath3 and a cutoff in distance of 33 mpc ( as listed by nbg ) were applied .",

    "error bars on the h@xmath0 photometry in this paper are derived from the sky error combined in quadrature with an estimate of a 3% error in the continuum subtraction factor .",
    "even a 3% error in the continuum subtraction factor can result in a large error in the h@xmath0 flux for galaxies with relatively weak h@xmath0 emission , as seen for two galaxies ( from left to right , ngc 5273 and ic 356 ) .",
    "kennicutt & akiyama estimate a typical error in literature values of 5 - 15% ; the error bars shown in the plot are at the 10% level .",
    "cross symbols show those galaxies with one literature measurement .",
    "differences between authors can be much larger than estimated errors , as seen for two galaxies with two measurements in the literature : ngc 7098 ( solid circles ) and ugc 3580 ( asterisks ) . [ haphotcomp ] ]",
    "broadband  r and h@xmath0 images , surface photometry , and quantitative parameters describing central concentrations and star formation rates have been obtained for a sample of 29 isolated s0-scd spiral galaxies .",
    "further analyses of the spacial distribution of star formation in these galaxies are provided in several papers .",
    "the properties of these galaxies are quantitatively compared to those of virgo cluster galaxies in koopmann & kenney ( 1998 ; 2004a ; 2004b ) .",
    "scale lengths are presented and compared to virgo cluster and other field galaxies in koopmann , haynes , & catinella ( 2005 ) .",
    "the funding for the research on the virgo cluster and isolated spiral galaxies was provided by nsf grant ast-9322779 .",
    "we thank r.b .",
    "tully for providing us with the online version of the nearby galaxies catalog and software to access it , p. fouqu for providing us with a list of isolated galaxies , and r. pogge for excellent advice on obtaining the best continuum subtractions .",
    "we are grateful to sydney barnes , shardha jogee , jerry orosz , sally cersosimo , and charles bailyn for obtaining many of the images in this paper during yale service observing runs .",
    "this work was substantially aided by observing support from the kitt peak and cerro tololo staffs .",
