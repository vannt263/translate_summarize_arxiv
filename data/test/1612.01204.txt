    "modern photometric surveys have lead to discovery of hundred thousands of new variable stars , which are subject of robust classification and determination of the main phenomenological parameters , which are necessary for a registration in the general catalogue of variable stars `` @xcite or in the aavso ' ' variable stars index `` @xcite - the type , brightness at maxima and minima , period , initial epoch , duration of eclipse in per cent ( for eclipsing binaries ) , or asymmetry @xmath4 for pulsating variables . in the ' ' remarks \" section for the eclipsing variables",
    ", it is needed to list an amplitude of the secondary minimum , duration of the total eclipse .",
    "one may note previous extensive studies in ukraine of algols @xcite , @xmath0 lyr @xcite @xcite , w uma - type stars @xcite ( for more details , see classical monographs @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recent reviews and monographs are published in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these studies are carried out in a frame of the international campaign `` inter - longitude astronomy '' ( @xcite,@xcite ) and national projects `` ukrainian virtual observatory '' and `` astroinformatics '' ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "one of the most common methods for the analysis of periodic signals is a trigonometric polynomial approximation ( sometimes referred to as a truncated fourier series ) .",
    "statistically optimal degree of trigonometric polynomial is often small for `` almost sinusoidal '' signals ( e.g. pulsating variables @xcite , @xcite ) but increases significantly if the signal has intervals of rapid change @xcite , @xcite . for algols , which are characterized by relatively narrow",
    "eclipses , this is the case , which can be observed in the phase light curves of eclipsing binary systems , especially of the algol type .",
    "the modelling of the light curves of eclipsing binaries using the fourier coefficients was discussed by @xcite ( mainly for ew - type stars ) , @xcite ( mainly for algol - type stars ) and references therein .",
    "although the fourier coefficients may be determined with an excellent accuracy for the theoretical light curves , the accuracy of the coefficients for the really observed light curves is much worse either due to the observational errors , or due to inhomogeneity of coverage of the light curve by observations .",
    "the usual simplified equations for the fourier coefficients should be replaced by complete equations for the least squares ( lsq ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another approach is to use special shapes ( also called `` patterns '' or `` profiles '' ) of the eclipses .",
    "the simplified model of spherical components with a constant brightness distribution is widely used ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for a preliminary determination of the parameters .",
    "also there is an approach to compute `` physical '' models based on the approach proposed by wilson and devinney @xcite realized by various authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , also for more complicated cases with accretion disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the real physical modelling assumes additional spectroscopic observations to determine orbital velocities of the components , the mass ratio , and temperature(s ) .",
    "this is available for @xmath5 of the known objects , so for the rest the phenomenological modelling is the only source of information .",
    "fixing values of some of these unknown parameters ( temperature at the pole of one component and the mass ratio ) , it is possible to compute the rest of them .",
    "however , the ( statistically ) same quality of the approximation may be obtained for a region in the parameter space , rather than at some `` statistically optimal '' point .",
    "such computations need much longer computational time , the error estimates need even much more resources , thus the `` phenomenological '' approximations using simpler functions remain much more effective in a sense `` less computer resources to get a same accuracy '' .",
    "generally , the phenomenological parameters may be determined using two classes of the approximations : the `` local '' and `` global '' ones .",
    "the first class is based on the `` local '' approximations of the extrema , historically starting from `` hand - written '' approximation of the points on a millimeter paper ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . later on ,",
    "the intervals near the extrema were approximated using algebraic polynomials of the user - defined degree ( often an ordinary parabola @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or using the statistically optimal degree ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "other advanced methods were reviewed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the trigonometric polynomial ( also called the `` restricted fourier series '' ) is expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 is an integer part of @xmath9 @xmath10 is phase , @xmath11 is time , @xmath12 is the initial epoch , and @xmath13 is the period ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "if needed , the period may be improved using differential corrections .",
    "the `` symmetrical '' trigonometric polynomial contains only terms with cosines , the coefficients @xmath14 of the terms with sines are suggested to be zero ( e.g. if their deviations from zero are not statistically significant , one may fix these values to zero ) , as realized in the program mcv @xcite .",
    "if they are statistically significant , the maxima are unequal , what is called the oconnell effect ( @xcite ) .    for the light curves of eclipsing variables",
    ", it may be effective to split the trigonometric polynomial into two parts : @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "obviously , their sum corresponds to @xmath16 and the difference  to @xmath17 respectively .",
    "if the oconnell effect is absent , the `` mean '' function @xmath18 describes the out - of - eclipse part of the light curve , and twice - the minima `` of equal depth and shape '' .",
    "the difference between the minima are described by the `` deviation '' function @xmath19 which , in a case of ew - type stars is very close to zero at all phases .",
    "for statistically best approximation , one has to use differential corrections to determine not only the period , but also the initial epoch .    for the algol - type stars , the statistically significant degree of the trigonometrical polynomial @xmath20 computed using the fischer s criterion , may reach 21 , leading to a huge number of parameters @xmath21 ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "another star was best characterized by even larger value @xmath22 ( @xcite ) , showing a strong gibbs phenomemon .",
    "andronov ( @xcite,@xcite ) proposed a non - polynomial spline approximation @xmath23 additionally , we define a particular sum @xmath24 which contains only 5 terms without taking into account the contributions ( to the stellar magnitude ) of the primary ( 6-th term ) and secondary ( 7-th term ) eclipses .    here , for suitability of computations ,",
    "the phase is redefined to be in the interval @xmath25 instead of the usual definition in the main interval @xmath26 moreover , the phase may be corrected as @xmath27 to take into account possible corrections for the initial epoch and the period ( see @xcite for more details ) . here",
    "@xmath28 is the phase corresponding to the initial values of @xmath12 and @xmath29    the basic pattern ( shape ) is @xmath30 where a dimensionless parameter @xmath31 .",
    "so , the parameters have following meanings :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the first 7 parameters may be determined using the linear least squares method , but other 7 `` non - linear '' parameters @xmath32 may be determined using the differential corrections after a `` brute force '' minimization of the test ( target ) function @xmath33 the `` unit weight '' error @xmath34 and the r.m.s .",
    "accuracy of the approximation at the phases of observations is @xmath35=\\sigma_{0m}\\sqrt{m / n}.$ ] in the current version of the program , it is possible to fix some parameters , not permitting corrections to them .",
    "the properties of the test function were discussed in @xcite .    in the previous versions ,",
    "the monte - carlo method was used for the minimization of the test function in the parameter space , but it needs much more computational time as compared to the combination of the `` brute force''@xmath36``differential corrections '' ( @xcite ) .    the light curves of the prototype stars algol , @xmath0 lyr and w uma are shown in figures 1,2,3 , respectively , and the best fit parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have used the published photoelectric observations for these stars , the references are shown in the figure captions . for two stars ,",
    "the observations were obtained in two filters ( b and v for @xmath0 lyr and blue ( `` b '' ) and yellow ( `` y '' ) for w uma ) , so we used our program to these data files separately .",
    "the only parameter , which is expected to be the same for all filters , is @xmath37 for the analysed data , the difference between the estimates obtained for different filters , is not statistically significant for the examined stars . also one may note a significantly narrower eclipse in algol @xmath38 as compared to @xmath0 lyr @xmath39 and w uma @xmath40 as the eclipse duration is dependent on the sum of relative radii of the components and the inclination , the eb and ew - type stars may have small durations , but the ea - type stars typically have @xmath41    for the `` fine tuning '' , one has to minimize the weighted sum of the test functions , which depend on this joint parameter ( the rest are computed to minimize the test function after fixing the trial value of this parameter ) .",
    "such an approach we previously used in @xcite .    in an addition to the best fit parameters , we use additional combinations of them , which are related to the physical parameters of the stars . among them",
    "are @xmath42 and @xmath43 the ratio of the deficit of flux at the eclipse ( primary and secondary , respectively ) to the theoretically expected value assuming that the obscuration is absent .",
    "this may be significantly different from typically used value of the amplitude defined as @xmath44 because we take into accounts the reflection , ellipticity and the oconnell effects , thus @xmath45 @xmath46 the differences in the estimates of the eclipse depths using these methods may reach dozens per cent for the ew - type stars , and , for the elliptic - type stars ( no eclipses ) , our method will indicate @xmath47 and @xmath48 within the error estimates .",
    "the classical amplitude will remain detectable @xmath49    there are two parameters , which are related to @xmath50 @xmath51 namely , their sum @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first one characterizes the presence of eclipse ( @xmath54 if no eclipse , and @xmath55 if both eclipses are total ) .",
    "the brightness ratio @xmath56 indicates the relative temperatures of the components . using these parameters for both filters , and the statistical relationships mass - luminosity - radius , we @xcite estimated the physical parameters of the newly discovered system 2mass j@xmath57 = vsx j@xmath58    six other newly discovered stars show a presence of the contribution of",
    "eclipses not only for the ea - type , but also for the ew @xcite .    for the stars algol and @xmath0 lyr ,",
    "we have used the phases computed by the authors of the corresponding papers , thus no period correction was made , thus the parameter @xmath59 was set to zero . for w uma ,",
    "the corrections are small , but may be determined .",
    "a separate remark should be done on the fixed values of @xmath60 or @xmath61 from the model of spherical stars with uniform brightness distribution , one may expect the minimal limit of @xmath0 in eq.([eq12 ] ) of 1.5 , which corresponds to a coincidence of both inner contacts of equal stars at an inclination @xmath62 in other cases , this value is expected to be larger . if the value of the parameter after any iteration formally goes outside the user - defined limits , this value is set to the corresponding nearest limit ( minimal or maximal ) , and the parameter becomes fixed at the limit , unless next iteration will move it inside the `` permitted '' interval .",
    "however , for the examined stars , the minima are sharp enough to make this parameter be equal to the minimal limit either for algol , or to w uma . for @xmath0 lyr , the parameter @xmath60 is the same within error estimates for both filters , whereas @xmath63 which corresponds to the secondary minimum , has a very large error estimate . analysing the fig 2",
    ", one may suggest that this is due to a shallow minimum and a relatively small number of points . despite this parameter",
    "is unsure , the corresponding depth of the minima is characterized by a better accuracy estimate .",
    "as the shape parameters @xmath0 are often equal to the minimal limit 1.5 for the examined stars , as well as for the previously studied stars , we have applied approximations with additional parameters .",
    "the dozens of modified functions were tested by @xcite , @xcite . in figure 4 ,",
    "there are shown the part of the approximation near the primary minimum with the main set of parameters listed in table 1 , as well as modifications .",
    "one of the modifications is for the value @xmath64 which corresponds to a triangular shape at the center of the eclipse .",
    "this triangle makes an apparent enlarging of the eclipse depth , however , which is not statistically different from the previous approximation .",
    "another modification was found to be the best by @xcite .",
    "it redefines @xmath65 in eq.([eq12 ] ) as @xmath66 where @xmath67 for the primary minimum and @xmath68 where @xmath69 for the secondary minimum .",
    "the obvious restrictions are @xmath70 @xmath71 the depth of the minimum is the same within error estimates , and there is a good approximation of both the ascending and descending branches .",
    "we have applied the algorithm nav ( `` new algol variable '' ) to three prototype stars and obtained phenomenological parameters , which may be used for comparison with that for other stars .",
    "the method is effective not only for the ea - type systems , for which it was mainly elaborated , but also for eb and even ew -type stars .",
    "the revised definition of the depth of the minimum with taking into account effects of proximity ( reflection , ellipticity and oconnell ) leads to more precise determination of the ratio of the mean brightnesses of the eclipsed parts of the components , which is useful for the physical modelling .",
    "the current algorithm may be used for determination of phenomenological parameters of numerous new variables discovered from the ground - based and space surveys .",
