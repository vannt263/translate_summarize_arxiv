    "a large number of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) are believed to harbor neutron stars , rotating rapidly due to accretion - induced angular momentum transfer .",
    "these systems show many complex spectral and temporal behaviors .",
    "one of the main purpose for studying such behaviors is to understand the properties of very high density @xmath0 g @xmath1 matter at the neutron star core .",
    "such high densities can not be created in the laboratory and only the study of these sources can give a possible answer to this fundamental question of physics . here",
    "we calculate the equation of state ( eos ) dependent model spectra of the accretion disks around rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "these models , when fitted to the observed spectra , can in principle help to constrain eos models and hence to understand the properties of core - matter of neutron stars .",
    "we compute the structure of a rapidly rotating neutron star for realistic eos models , gravitational masses and rotational speeds using the same procedure as cook , shapiro , & teukolsky ( 1994 ) .",
    "we use the axisymmetric metric ( see bhattacharyya et al .",
    "2000 for description ) @xmath2    to calculate the metric coefficients and the bulk structure parameters of the neutron star , we solve einstein s field equations and the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium simultaneously . for a thin blackbody disk , we compute the temperature profile ( see bhattacharyya et al . 2000 ) and hence the spectrum ( see bhattacharyya , bhattacharya , & thampan 2001b ) considering the effect of the doppler shift , gravitational redshift and light - bending effects .",
    "we calculate the spectra for different eos models , which therefore gives a way to constrain eoss when fitted to the observed spectra",
    ". however , the computation of the complete spectrum in this manner is rather time - consuming and therefore not quite suitable for routine use .",
    "therefore , in order to make our results available for routine spectral fitting work , we intend to present a series of approximate parametric fits to our computed spectra in a forthcoming publication . as a first step towards this aim , here",
    "we present an analytical function which describes both the relativistic spectra and the newtonian spectra well .",
    "this function with three free parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 is given by ( see bhattacharyya , misra , & thampan 2001a for details ) @xmath5 where , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the energy of the photons in kev and @xmath8 is in units of photons / sec/@xmath9/kev .",
    "the value of @xmath10-parameter is @xmath11 for the newtonian case , while it ranges from @xmath12 to @xmath13 for the relativistic cases ( if the value of inclination angle is not too high ) .",
    "therefore , constraining this parameter by fits to future observational data may indicate the effect of strong gravity in the observed spectrum .",
    "this work is a step forward towards constraining eos models of neutron stars by fitting the observed spectra of lmxbs ."
