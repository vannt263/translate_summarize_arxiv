    "estrogens are essential endogenous hormones that modulate the development and homeostasis of a wide range of target tissues , such as the reproductive tracts , breast and skeletal system @xcite .",
    "estrogenic hormones have multi - faceted and wide - ranging effects in vertebrate animals . for estrogens such as 17@xmath0-estradiol ( e2 ) to exert their biological effects , they must interact with cellular estrogen receptors ( er ) .",
    "studies have shown that ers are part of two distinct estrogenic transduction pathways .",
    "one pathway provides a rapid , nongenomic pathway initiated by membrane bound ers at the cell surface @xcite .",
    "the other pathway provides direct genomic control in which ers act as transcription factors within the cell nucleus @xcite .",
    "these ers are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand - modulated transcription factors @xcite .",
    "there are two different subtypes of these ers , referred to as @xmath3 and @xmath0 , each encoded by a separate gene .    recently , nagler et al @xcite reported the novel er@xmath5 and both er@xmath0 isoforms in the rainbow trout , _ oncorhynchus mykiss _ , and performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis with all other known fish er gene sequences .",
    "their phylogenetic analysis indicates that the duplication leading to the two er@xmath0 isoforms arose prior to the divergence of the ray finned fish attributable to a whole genome duplication that occurred in the teleost ancestor ( see fig [ fig : tree ] ) @xcite .",
    "the er@xmath3 isoforms , on the other hand , appear to have arisen as a result of a second more recent whole genome duplication event that occurred in the salmonid ancestor 25100 million years ago @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the second er@xmath3 isozyme that arose during the earlier genome duplication appears to have been lost subsequently , since no other ray finned fish are known to have a second er@xmath3 isoform .",
    "this also indicates that the expected duplications of er@xmath8 and er@xmath2 were lost subsequent to the salmonid genome duplication .",
    "the purpose of the study is to employ molecular dynamics simulations to determine the binding affinities between e2 and ers of the different isoforms in the rainbow trout and to use the results to provide insight into the underlying evolutionary selection pressure on the ers .",
    "our binding affinity results obtained from insertion and deletion are very similar indicating that our simulations are well converged and that accurate estimates of binding affinities were obtained .",
    "our results show that e2 binds preferentially to er@xmath4 over er@xmath5 .",
    "by contrast , the difference in binding affinity is less significant for the @xmath0 subtype , i.e. , both isoforms bind similarly to e2 .",
    "we also computed @xmath7n/@xmath7s ratios for the er isoforms .",
    "these results suggest that the er@xmath4 gene is evolving under relaxed selection compared to all other salmonid er@xmath3 genes .",
    "the initial coordinates for the estradiol were first extracted from the human er - e2 complexes ( pdb : 1qku ) ( fig [ fig:1qku ] ) .",
    "the topologies were then generated by the prodrg server @xcite with the options of full charges and no energy minimization .",
    "the rainbow trout er _ holo _ structures for the e2 binding domain were generated by swiss - model @xcite using human er as templates ( pdb entries 1a52 for er@xmath3 s and 3ert for er@xmath0 s ) .",
    "sequence identities between trout and human estrogen binding domains are within the range of 7585% .",
    "the estradiol was first docked into the binding pocket of the receptor _ holo _ structure with autodock @xcite . in this protocol ,",
    "the receptor structure is held rigid and the estradiol is free to rotate and explore most probable binding poses using the lamarckian genetic algorithm .",
    "the number of genetic algorithm runs was set to 1,000 with a population size of 5,000 individuals and 5,000,000 generations .",
    "the number of evaluations was set to 2,500,000 for each individual in the population to ensure thorough exploration of the search space .",
    "the mutation rate was set to 0.02 and crossover 0.8 .",
    "two - point crossover was used to generate the offspring at each successive generation .",
    "the genetic algorithm automatically preserved the 10 best - fit individuals to the next generation and the 10 least - fit individuals were not used to generate offspring .",
    "a total of 1,000 independent docking trials were performed for each of the four ers .",
    "the best binding pose from each trial was collected and ranked based on the scores .",
    "these best - fit binding poses were first visually inspected for consistency with human er and the one with the highest score was then used as the starting structure for the simulations .",
    "similar human er structures were used as templates to generate structures for trout ers .",
    "image was rendered using vmd @xcite.,width=345 ]      to estimate e2-er binding affinities we note that , since the free energy is a state function , it permits the selection of an arbitrary path connecting the bound and unbound states .",
    "therefore , we decomposed the binding free energy calculation into several steps in which the e2 is annihilated ( i.e. , decoupled ) from its bound state in the receptor complex and then made to reappear in solution to complete the thermodynamic cycle . for brevity ,",
    "we subsequently define _ deletion _ to be when interactions between e2 and its environment are turned off and _ insertion _ to be when these interactions are turned on .",
    "fig [ fig : cycle ] shows the thermodynamic cycle we used to calculate binding affinities ( see also refs @xcite ) .",

    "re _ represents the solvated complex of the e2 and receptor , and @xmath9 denotes the free energy of restraining the e2 in the binding pocket of the receptor which will depend on the details of restraint .",
    "next , the electrostatic and lennard - jones interactions of the e2 are gradually turned off ( white ) in two separate steps using alchemical simulations .",
    "the free energies @xmath10 and @xmath11 are associated with deleting or inserting electrostatic and lennard - jones interactions respectively . with",
    "the e2 fully decoupled from its environment , the restraint is then removed .",
    "the free energy @xmath12 is associated with the removal of this restraint .",
    "next the e2 interactions are turned back on with no receptor present .",
    "the free energy @xmath13 and @xmath14 are associated with turning on the electrostatic and lennard - jones interactions respectively .",
    "finally , we account for the difference between the standard ( @xmath15 ) and simulation volume ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the binding affinity between the estrogen receptors and e2 is thus the sum of the free energies , @xmath17    -estradiol .",
    "we used six harmonic restraints acting on three anchor atoms in the e2 and three in the receptor .",
    "the restraints consisted of one distance ( @xmath18 ) , two angle ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , and three dihedral ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) restraints that determine the orientation of three carbons in the e2 relative to three @xmath3-carbons in the receptors.,width=384 ]      to facilitate convergence restraints were applied to restrict the positions of e2 relative to the receptors .",
    "boresch et al @xcite and mobley et al @xcite reported that the presence of multiple metastable ligand orientations can cause convergence problems for free energy estimates .",
    "the authors further suggested using a restraining potential to keep the ligand in the binding site during the simulation process .",
    "with such a restraining potential the ligand is no longer required to sample the entire simulation volume ( particularly a problem when ligand is decoupled ) . moreover",
    ", the restraint minimizes the detrimental effects of end - point singularities commonly reported in alchemical simulations @xcite .",
    "mobley et al @xcite also pointed out that the equilibrium geometry of the restraints is arbitrary and will not affect the asymptotic estimate of the binding free energy . in this work , we judiciously selected anchor atoms from the more rigid alpha helices that form the e2 binding pocket .",
    "the restraints included one distance ( with the force constant of 1000 kj / mol/@xmath24 ) , two angle ( 1000 kj / mol / rad ) , and three dihedral restraints ( 1000 kj / mol/@xmath25 ) that determine the orientation of three carbons in the e2 relative to three @xmath3-carbons in the receptors ( see fig [ fig : restraint ] ) .",

    "the simulation systems each contained approximately 16,500 simple point charge ( spc ) water molecules @xcite .",
    "short - range interactions were evaluated using a neighbor list of 1.0 nm updated at every 10 steps .",
    "van der waals interactions used a cutoff with a smoothing function such that the interactions slowly decayed to zero between 0.75 nm and 0.90 nm .",
    "a long - range analytical dispersion correction was applied to the energy and pressure to account for the truncation of the lennard - jones interactions @xcite .",
    "electrostatic interactions were evaluated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) @xcite with a real space cutoff of 1.0 nm , a spline order of 6 , a fourier spacing of 0.1 m , and relative tolerance between long and short range energies of @xmath27 .",
    "all bonds to hydrogen were constrained with lincs @xcite with an order of 12 , and a time step of 2 fs was used for dynamics .    for equilibration , the systems were first minimized using 1,000 steps of l - bfgs ( broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ) @xcite , followed by 1,000 steps of steepest descent minimization .",
    "the system was then subject to 1.0 ns of simulation using isothermal molecular dynamics .",
    "this was followed by another 1.0 ns of simulation using isothermal - isobaric dynamics with the berendsen barostat with a time constant of 1.0 ns .",
    "for all simulations the temperature was maintained at 277 k using langevin dynamics @xcite with a friction coefficient of 1.0 amu / ps .",
    "the coupling time was set to 0.5 ps , and the isothermal compressibility was set to @xmath28 bar@xmath29 .",
    "after equilibration , production simulations were run with isothermal - isobaric conditions using langevin dynamics at the temperature of 277 k. the pressure was maintained at 1.0 atm using the parrinello - rahman algorithm @xcite .",
    "the temperature was chosen as it closely resembles the water temperature for the natural habitat of rainbow trout .",
    "energies were recorded every 0.2 ps during production runs , and trajectory snapshots every 1.0 ps .",
    "the first 50% of each simulation was discarded for equilibration .",
    "we used the formula suggested by boresch et al @xcite to analytically calculate the free energy @xmath12 associated with adding the restraints to e2 when decoupled from its environment .",
    "we also analytically calculated the free energy @xmath30 that accounts for the difference between the standard ( @xmath15 ) and simulation volume ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "the free energies @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , were estimated using the thermodynamic integration ( ti ) method @xcite . to minimize the numerical integration errors we employed the polynomial regression techniques to calculate free energy difference , instead of trapezoidal quadrature @xcite .",
    "separate simulations were performed for changes in the lennard - jones with 21 values of the scaling parameter , @xmath31 = 0.0 , 0.05 , 0.1  0.9 , 0.95 , and 1.0 , and the electrostatics with 11 @xmath31 values , @xmath31 = 0.0 , 0.024 , 0.095 , 0.206 , 0.345 , 0.5 , 0.655 , 0.794 , 0.905 , 0.976 , and 1.0 . for simulations with only lennard - jones ,",
    "all partial charges were set to zero and the soft - core scaling parameter was set to 0.5 . once the neutral atoms were fully grown in the solvent , the second simulations then computed the free energy associated with the electrostatics with a soft - core scaling parameter of 0.0 .",
    "this was accomplished by increasing the partial charges from zero to their final values given by the forcefield .    the free energy associated with the restraints , @xmath9 was calculated using the bennett acceptance ratio approach @xcite .",
    "we performed 1.0 ns equilibrium simulation for the estradiol - receptor complex using each of the harmonic restraining potentials with force constants of 0 , 25 , 40 , 60 , 90 , 150 , 200 , 300 , 450 , 700 , and 1000 kj / mol/@xmath24 for distance , kj / mol / rad for angle , and kj / mol/@xmath25 for dihedral restraints .",
    "the first 0.5 ns of each simulation was discarded for equilibration and the remaining 0.5 ns was used to compute the free energy differences .",

    "<S> molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the binding affinities between the hormone 17@xmath0-estradiol ( e2 ) and different estrogen receptor ( er ) isoforms in the rainbow trout , _ oncorhynchus mykiss_. previous phylogenetic analysis indicates that a whole genome duplication prior to the divergence of ray - finned fish led to two distinct er@xmath0 isoforms , er@xmath1 and er@xmath2 , and the recent whole genome duplication in the ancestral salmonid created two er@xmath3 isoforms , er@xmath4 and er@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the objective of our computational studies is to provide insight into the underlying evolutionary pressures on these isoforms . for the er@xmath3 subtype </S>",
    "<S> our results show that e2 binds preferentially to er@xmath4 over er@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> tests of lineage specific @xmath7n/@xmath7s ratios indicate that the ligand binding domain of the er@xmath5 gene is evolving under relaxed selection relative to all other er@xmath3 genes . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the highly conserved dna binding domain suggests that er@xmath5 may be undergoing neofunctionalization possibly by binding to another ligand . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , both er@xmath8 and er@xmath2 bind similarly to e2 and the best fitting model of selection indicates that the ligand binding domain of all er@xmath0 genes are evolving under the same level of purifying selection , comparable to er@xmath4 . </S>"
