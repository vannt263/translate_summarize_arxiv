    "speculations concerning the existence and frequency of brown dwarfs can be traced to before the introduction of the term @xcite . since then , wide - field surveys have uncovered hundreds of candidates in the field and revealed two new spectral types , the l and t dwarfs @xcite . yet the frequency of brown dwarfs compared to stars has remained a topic of confusion and debate . in a pioneering work ,",
    "@xcite attempted the first census of the substellar initial mass function ( imf ) based on results from the two micron all sky survey @xcite .",
    "they presented evidence for a low - mass imf that was more shallow than a salpeter @xcite slope , suggesting that brown dwarfs were not a significant contributor to dark matter .",
    "@xcite used a bayesian approach to constrain the power - law slope below 0.08 @xmath2 to be in the range @xmath3 with a confidence level of 60% , where a salpeter slope is @xmath4 .",
    "these results indicate that , although brown dwarfs do not contribute significantly to the mass of typical stellar populations , they might still be as abundant as stars @xcite .",
    "the classical approach to deriving the mass function for stars and substellar objects is to take an observed luminosity function and apply a mass - luminosity relationship in order to derive the present - day mass function .",
    "then , corrections , based on the theory of stellar evolution , permit one to estimate an _ initial _ mass function from the present - day mass function ( see e.g. @xcite for complete descriptions of this process ) .",
    "the confounding variable in these analyses is the star formation history of the galactic disk , which is vital for substellar objects whose mass  luminosity relationship evolves with time .    a different approach is to use star clusters of known age as laboratories to measure the imf .",
    "open clusters are in principle good candidates because of their richness .",
    "yet they suffer from the effects of dynamical evolution , mass segregation , and evaporation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "young ( @xmath5 10 myr ) embedded clusters are attractive alternatives as they are compact and rich ( from hundreds to thousands of stars within 0.31 pc ) , and yet to emerge as unbound ob / t associations , and the low mass objects are 101000 times more luminous than their older open cluster counterparts ( 0.116 gyr ) because they shrink and cool as they age .",
    "indeed , embedded clusters have been the targets of aggressive photometric and spectroscopic surveys in an attempt to search for variations in the imf as a function of initial conditions .",
    "@xcite found that the ratio of high - mass ( 110 @xmath6 ) to low - mass ( 0.11 @xmath6 ) stars for an ensemble of young clusters within 1 kpc was consistent with ( 1 ) each other and ( 2 ) having been drawn from the field star imf .",
    "more recent studies have pushed well into the substellar mass regime ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "there have been some claims for variations in the brown dwarf imf between nearby star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite argued that the low - density taurus dark cloud had a dearth of brown dwarfs compared to the rich orion nebula cluster ( onc ) .",
    "however , this preliminary result has been updated as additional data have become available and as the statistics improved for both clusters @xcite .",
    "here we use observations of seven nearby star clusters to constrain the combined brown dwarf imf . in section 2",
    ", we describe the data , illustrate that there is no strong evidence for variation in the substellar imf between the star - forming regions , and outline our approach to constrain the low - mass imf . in section 3 we present our results , and in section 4 we discuss our results in the context of previous work as well as theories of star ( and substellar object ) formation .",
    "we have compiled the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs in nearby , well - studied young embedded clusters and the pleiades .",
    "the regions included in this study are described briefly below , where the ratio of stars ( 0.081.0 @xmath2 ) to brown dwarfs ( 0.030.08 @xmath2 ) is calculated .",
    "for all the regions , we consider the _ system _ imf , uncorrected for multiplicity within 200 au .",
    "the sample is focused on embedded clusters , in which spectroscopy has been used to determine the age of the cluster , field star contamination has been taken into account , and an extinction - limited sample has been defined . furthermore , we have included the pleiades , because it is one of the best - studied open clusters and bacause its substellar imf has been estimated .",
    "the break point at 0.08 @xmath2 has been adopted in accordance with the break point for the @xcite imf , similar to the characteristic mass in the @xcite single object imf .",
    "only a few of the clusters adopted here have the imf derived in an extinction - limited sample reaching 0.02 @xmath2 and we have opted for 0.03 @xmath2 as a lower mass limit to obtain a larger sample of clusters .",
    "_ @xcite imaged a 4 deg@xmath7 region of taurus that focused on the denser filaments , to identify cluster candidates .",
    "candidates were confirmed as cluster members , by use of follow - up intermediate - resolutionoptical spectroscopy , on the basis of their effective temperature , luminosity , and spectral features . in total ,",
    "112 objects were confirmed members with derived masses between 0.03 and 1.0 @xmath2 and extinctions a@xmath8 mag .",
    "some 96 objects were stars and 16 were brown dwarfs .",

    "the sub - sample from 0.03 to @xmath15 @xmath2 includes 24 objects and the ratio @xmath16 was found to be @xmath17 .",
    "_ pleiades . _",

    "here we focus on the survey by @xcite who covered a 6.4 deg@xmath7 region of the pleiades .",
    "the survey had a saturation limit of 0.48 @xmath2 .",
    "for higher masses , the survey was combined with a mass function built using the @xcite database .",
    "the pleiades suffer relatively low ( @xmath18 mag ) , mostly uniform , extinction , with negligible impact on the completeness of this sample , so we did not apply a reddening criterion .",
    "the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs was found to be @xmath19 .    _ the orion nebular cluster . _",
    "the onc has been the subject of extensive studies @xcite .",
    "we take the adopted ratio of stars to substellar objects from the study of @xcite . the total sample , covering the central 5.1@xmath105.1 , contains approximately 200 objects with masses between 0.02 and 0.6 @xmath6 and a@xmath20 mag . using their figure 14 , and extrapolating the slope from 0.080.6 to 1.0 @xmath6 ( one additional bin in their plot ) , we arrive at a ratio of stars to substellar objects of @xmath21 .",
    "_ ngc 2024 . _",
    "the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs in ngc 2024 was found by @xcite from their photometric and spectroscopic study , covering the central 10@xmath1010 .",
    "they assigned masses to the photometric objects on the basis of the mass distribution in each magnitude bin , determined from the spectroscopic sample as in @xcite .",
    "the result was that a total of 148 objects in their survey area has masses between 0.02 and 1 @xmath6 and extinctions a@xmath22 15 mag . based on their figure 9",
    ", we find that there are 27 objects between 0.03 and 0.08 @xmath6 resulting in a ratio of stars to substellar objects of @xmath23 .",
    "table  [ results ] shows the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for nearby embedded clusters and the pleiades , as described above , and the distribution of ratios is shown in fig ,  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the weighted mean of the ratios is found to be 4.3 , and the standard deviation of the weighted mean is 1.6 .",
    "all of the measurements presented are consistent with the weighted mean within 2@xmath24 .",
    "there is thus little evidence for variation in the low - mass imf between the different regions and we have adopted the hypothesis that the imf is universal . under this assumption ,",
    "the complete set of imf determinations can be combined to place constraints that are stronger than for each of the individual measurements .",
    "for each cluster , we have calculated the probability of obtaining the observed ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for a given imf or greater .",
    "the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs drawn from a given sample size with an assumed imf is determined by the binomial theorem .",
    "the predicted distribution of ratios from both segmented power - laws and a ( * ? ? ? * @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) lognormal imf for a cluster of 100 objects with unresolved binaries is shown in the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the peak mass in the lognormal is slightly higher , and the width is slightly more narrow than is presented in @xcite .",
    "the change in the best - fit parameters in @xcite is due to an updated luminosity function @xcite .",
    "a similar increase in the peak mass has been suggested by @xcite .",
    "the slope of the segmented power - law between 0.08 and 1.0 @xmath2 was chosen to be @xmath28 , and the slope has been varied below 0.08 @xmath2 in the range @xmath3 , which is the 60% confidence interval presented by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the rising and flat imfs ( @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively ) are difficult to reconcile with the observed distribution of ratios .",
    "we have quantitatively assessed the likelihood of obtaining the observed ratios from an assumed imf as follows . for each of the seven measurements ,",
    "the probability of obtaining that ratio or higher , assuming an underlying imf , is calculated by adopting the binomial theorem .",
    "the product of the seven probabilities is then calculated .",
    "we find these values , which we refer to as the binomial tail product , or btp , to be @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , for a chabrier , falling , flat , and rising imf , respectively . if each cluster sample was drawn from the assumed underlying imf , and if each cluster had an infinite number of objects , we would expect the combined product of this statistic for a sample of seven clusters to be @xmath35 .",
    "the lognormal imf appears to reproduce the observed ratios best , followed by the falling power - law imf .",
    "how consistent are the measured ratios with a chabrier imf and with what confidence can other imfs be ruled out ?",
    "we have investigated that question by performing monte carlo simulations .",
    "we created an artificial set of seven clusters , each containing 100 objects ( the median number of objects in our sample ) .",
    "the 100 objects are then assigned masses according to the assumed underlying imf , and the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs for each cluster is determined .",
    "for each of the ratios , the probability of observing that value or higher is calculated and the seven probabilities are multiplied , as was done for the observed set of clusters .",
    "the btp for the observed clusters is then compared with the distribution of btps just derived . because each factor in the btp is drawn from a binomial distribution ( of varying shapes ) , each imf gives the same expected distribution of btps .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] shows the cumulative distribution of btps for a set of 10,000 simulations .",
    "overplotted are the probabilities obtained above for the observed set of clusters assuming the four different underlying imfs .",
    "we find that 37% of the simulations have a probability equal to or lower than what was found assuming a chabrier imf , and in only @xmath360.05%-0.1% of the simulations is the probability equal to or lower than found assuming a falling power - law imf . in none of the simulations",
    "did the low probabilities for the flat or rising power - law imfs occur ( p @xmath5 0.01 % ) .",
    "the results indicate that the imf is falling in the brown dwarf regime and that the chabrier imf is consistent with the observations .",
    "the results on the imf presented here are based on the system imf , including binaries unresolved within 200 au . as such , they may be difficult to compare directly with the locally derived ( within 20 pc ) field imf discussed in @xcite that suffers from a much smaller fraction of unresolved binaries . yet the overall binary frequency for ultra - cool dwarfs ( m6 and later ) appears to be low ( @xmath3620% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and furthermore the _ relative _ number of companions with separations @xmath3715 au and mass ratios q @xmath37 0.4 may be extremely low around very cool stars @xmath36 1% ; @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "if the companion mass ratio distribution follows the chabrier imf at wide separations , then one could expect fewer very low mass companions as one surveys progressively lower mass primaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the observations by @xcite . if the imf follows a chabrier imf in the brown dwarf regime below 0.03 @xmath2 ( say , down to the opacity limit for fragmentation of @xmath36 0.001 - 0.004 @xmath2 ; @xcite , then the number of stars below 1 @xmath2 will outnumber brown dwarfs 4.7 to 1 .",
    "the sense of our results , that the mass function is falling in the bd regime , is consistent with various ideas put forward to explain the shape of the imf ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "building on the ideas of @xcite , @xcite produced an imf that is only weakly dependent on the jeans mass through dynamical interactions in the cluster .",
    "however , @xcite show that the turbulent fragmentation models by @xcite predict too few low - mass binary systems .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , suggest that the imf should peak at higher masses in regions with low turbulence ( e.g. taurus ) which would result in a higher ratio of stars to brown dwarfs .",
    "the lack of a strong variations in the ratio of stars to brown dwarfs is a problem for the turbulence models in general ; for example , magnetic turbulence models predict strong variations in the low - mass imf as a function of mach number and density @xcite .",
    "if the preliminary results indicated here are borne out through further observations , then models that depend only weakly on initial conditions would be required ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "possible imf variations at least within 1 kpc are smaller than can be detected by comparing the currently observed clusters .",
    "thus , there are two challenges in detecting imf variations : ( 1 ) one needs clusters with a well - sampled population to minimize the inherently stochastic nature of populating an imf , and ( 2 ) a larger set of clusters is needed to detect even small imf variations with initial conditions .",
    "although it appears that the variations in the imf down to 30 @xmath38 are modest , we still expect that variations will be seen at the lowest masses where the opacity limit for fragmentation can be reached @xcite and the metallicity of the star forming region could be imprinted in the lower mass limit .",
