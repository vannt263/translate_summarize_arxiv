    "shape - memory alloys ( smas ) are active crystalline materials with desirable mechanical properties , exploited in a number of applications from engineering to medicine , as actuators , sensors and dampeners @xcite . in these substances ,",
    "effects such as super- ( or pseudo-)elasticity and shape memory originate from a reversible martensitic transformation triggered by either stress or temperature .",
    "these phenomena are strongly affected by the formation of austenite / martensite microstructures , typically including twins and habit planes in various arrangements which may act as proper avenues for the reversible phase change  @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches have been developed for the analysis of such morphologies , going back to the classical ` crystallographic theory of martensite ' @xcite , based on considerations of kinematic compatibility between phases and variants .",
    "this viewpoint has been much developed in recent decades  @xcite .    in parallel , the experimental investigation of sma microstructure",
    "has adopted a variety of means , primarily optical and electron microscopy , originating an extensive literature , see for instance the references in @xcite . developments in the techniques of full - field measurements have recently also enabled the experimental analysis of the microstructural strain field over extended regions of a sample s surface .",
    "moir interferometry and digital image correlation are typical examples of such techniques , which collect information on the response of the tested sma samples by distinguishing the different phases through their strain amplitude  @xcite .",
    "infrared thermography has also been employed to measure the inhomogeneous temperature distributions associated with the phase change in smas , giving relevant information on the features of the martensitic transformation  @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of the phases and variants over a sample can also be deduced through the grid method @xcite , wherein this information is derived by analyzing the deformation of a periodic grid deposited on the sample , obtaining the strain levels which are generally different among the phases and their variants .",
    "a main advantage of the grid method is that it offers a good compromise between strain resolution and spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "however , this full - field measurement technique have not yet been employed to investigate phase - change intermittency in memory materials .",
    "this inhomogeneity is a fundamental feature of the martensitic transformation in smas , wherein under a smooth thermal or mechanical driving , the strain progresses through a set of discrete avalanche - like events , corresponding to transitions between neighboring metastable states .",
    "such effects have been previously studied through the measurement of calorimetric and/or acoustic signals  @xcite .",
    "these techniques have revealed many aspects of the bursty character of the martensitic transformation , with events exhibiting , in many cases , power - law size distributions , possibly after training  @xcite .",
    "this links reversible sma martensites to other material systems exhibiting intermittent dynamics and scale - free behavior , in magnetism , superconductivity , brittle fracture , crystal plasticity @xcite , in turn framing them within the background of a wide variety of complex systems in nature exhibiting avalanche - mediated behavior , as in turbulence , earthquakes , computer or social networks , and financial markets @xcite .",
    "while recent investigations have examined quantitatively some spatial aspects in the evolution of martensitic transition phenomena @xcite , there is a lack of systematic quantitative information on the strain events derived from the analysis of evolving strain maps during the phase change in smas . in the present study we used the grid method to perform the first full - field investigation of the intermittent progress of the microstructural strain field in a cu",
    "- al - be single crystal across the mechanically - induced martensitic transformation .",
    "this was done through uniaxial force - controlled loading tests , during which we have recorded and analyzed the super - elastic and hysteretic stress - strain behavior of the sample , as well as surface strain data in the forward and reverse transition .",
    "inspired by earlier work on the stress - controlled loading of smas in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , an experimental apparatus based on gravity was used , which applied to the sample a low - rate perfectly monotonic force , controlled by very slow flow water pumps , at almost isothermal conditions .",
    "the loading device was designed to be capable of very small force increments , enabling us to highlight the intermittency in the alloy , through the quantitative analysis of the strain field features measured over the sample .",
    "in contrast to conventional testing machines , as used for instance in  @xcite , in the present apparatus the crystal may freely adjust its orientation in relation to the vertical loading direction .",
    "a main reason for this was obtaining relatively less complex microstructures , developed in the presence of minimal extraneous effects such as external friction , lattice plastification , or thermal inhomogeneity , to enable us to investigate the strain transformation intermittency occurring in the crystal in its most elementary and basic form .",

    "the tank was filled with water during the experiments , enabling us to apply a gravity - load in the vertical direction .",
    "loading and unloading of the tank were controlled by electronic pumps producing a constant and slow flux of water .",
    "this allowed for a careful stress control of both the forward and reverse austenite - to - martensite phase change upon loading and unloading , respectively .",
    "as transformation stresses depend on the temperature , we ensured the stability of the ambient temperature @xmath14c during the entire duration of the test ( more than 45h ) . due to the very slow driving ,",
    "the testing conditions were almost isothermal . before using the pumps ,",
    "a pre - load was applied to the sample to reduce the test duration shortening the first part of the elastic climb where martensitic transformation events are negligible .",
    "this gave the reference configuration for the ensuing strain maps .",
    "the forward and reverse transformation plateaus were spanned through a slowly - varying , monotonic loading controlled by adjusting the water flow through the pumps .    in what follows",
    "we specifically report on a test in which we have observed the whole forward and reverse transformations under these conditions : ( a ) pre - load of 34.37mpa ; ( b ) constant loading rate 1.055mpa / h up to 57.29mpa ( duration : about 22h ) ; ( c ) constant unloading rate @xmath15mpa / h down to 35.95mpa ( duration : about 23h 15min ) . due to the inherent feedback loop in the control , very slow monotonic rates such as the ones above , obtained with the present device , are not possible with conventional testing machines . as a comparison , in earlier stress - controlled tests , such as in  @xcite , the rate was about 37mpa / h in the gauge region of the sample .",
    "we have gathered about 20,000 images of the sample over the 45-hour duration of the test , from which we have determined the spatial distribution of the strain levels on the sample surface by applying suitable grid - image processing .",
    "this enabled us to obtain four maps from each image during the loading - unloading cycle , giving the in - plane linear strain fields @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the rotation - angle field @xmath10 about the @xmath18-direction ( see fig .",

    "the presence of a single variant in this test is indicated by the very homogeneous values for the field @xmath16 in the red martensitic domain of the sample ( with average approaching @xmath23 near the end of the transformation ) , and by the fact that the shear component @xmath17 has constant sign .",

    "the very slow driving allowed us to highlight for the first time in a quantitative way the strain intermittency that marks the martensitic transformation in smas .",
    "we have characterized the non - smooth progress of the transformation by first studying the intermittency for both the global ( body - averaged ) and local ( pixel - level ) strain measures .",
    "we have thereafter identified the organization of possibly long - range events , i.e.  strain avalanches , and studied their statistical properties ( see also the supplementary videos @xcite ) .",
    "many earlier experiments based on the acoustic emission accompanying the martensitic transformation in smas have shown some decades of avalanche - size scaling in the austenite - martensite dynamics @xcite .",
    "the statistics that we have now uncovered for our strain events indicate that power - law behavior pertains also to a broad distribution of strain - avalanche intensities , covering almost six decades well into the macroscopic sample scales .",
    "these results extend and make more quantitatively precise the results recently reported in @xcite about the possible scale - free behavior of the surface optical activity in sma martensitic transformation .",
    "we interpret this strain phenomenology as deriving from the evolution of the crystalline substance within a complex energy landscape whose local minimizers represent distinct microstructural morphologies @xcite .",
    "the strain avalanches evidenced here mark the progress of the material through such minimizers under the loading @xcite .",
    "the associated display of bursty scale - free behavior , as we presently observe , may confirm the indications about the critical nature of the reversible martensitic transformation in smas  @xcite , in analogy to what is observed also in the plastic flow of many crystals @xcite .",
    "we have also described a number of other aspects of the observed phase change , evidencing especially the non - stationarity of the material response along the transformation plateaus , and the asymmetric behavior characterized in the forward vs.  the reverse transformation process .",
    "further experimental work along the lines developed in the present study can be envisaged in various directions .",
    "this should advance our understanding , analysis , and possible control of phase coexistence and its evolution under changing external conditions , and may aid in the design of materials with targeted properties .    .",

    "the online supplemental material @xcite accompanying this paper comprises four video files illustrating a number of different aspects of the phase transformation .",
    "hereafter we give some details on the experimental methods .",
    "[ figure_1 ] shows schematically the cual@xmath0be@xmath1 ( wt .  % ) single crystal sample and the testing apparatus .",
    "the sample dimensions are @xmath47 mm@xmath48 respectively along the @xmath5- , @xmath6- , and @xmath18-directions in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] , the vertical distance between the clamped aluminum tabs being @xmath49 mm .",
    "the monitored gauge region has dimensions @xmath3 mm @xmath4 38 mm respectively along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes .",
    "the rotation matrix giving the orientation of the austenitic cubic single crystal of cu - al - be with respect to the reference axes was measured by x - ray diffraction , and is given by , in the same reference frame of fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] ( see also @xcite ) :      we measured the in - plane displacement , the linear strain components and the local rotation on the gauge region of the sample through the grid method . this technique derives these quantities from the images of a grid captured by a camera as the sample deforms under the loading .",
    "grids are transferred onto the sample surface using the procedure described in  @xcite . the grid pattern ( square , with pitch @xmath51  mm ) was printed on a thin polymeric substrate using a 12,000-dpi high - definition printer and then laid on a thin adhesive layer ( e@xmath52 glue from epotecny , whose white color optimizes the visual contrast with the black grid lines . after curing for about @xmath53h at @xmath54c , the polymeric substrate",
    "is carefully removed , but the black ink of the grid lines remain bonded on the thin adhesive layer and the sample becomes ready for testing .",
    "the deformation of the grid can reasonably be assumed to be the same as that of the surface of the sample as the glue layer is very thin ( some tenths of mm ) , and has negligible stiffness compared to that of the sample , making this a non - intrusive measurement technique .",
    "the maximum strain that can be sustained by the grid without debonding or cracking is about @xmath55 , which can well accommodate any strain reached during the martensitic transformation in our alloy .    in our experiment ,",
    "the images of the deformed grid during the tests were captured by a sensicam qe camera featuring a @xmath56-bit/@xmath57 pixel sensor and a @xmath58-mm sigma lens .",
    "the camera was secured on a mounting plate whose position was adjusted so that the lines of the grid were parallel to the pixels of the sensor along both the horizontal and vertical axes .",
    "an appropriate magnification allowed to clearly distinguish the black lines of the grid .",
    "this magnification was adjusted so that one grid pitch was encoded with 5  pixels .",
    "three movable light guides fed by a kl @xmath59 lcd cold light source were used during image acquisition to obtain a nearly - uniform lighting of the grid .",
    "about 20,000 images of the deforming sample were obtained over the whole duration of the test , one about every 8 sec , with 15-min pauses about every 100min for data recording and refilling the water reservoirs which feed the pumps .",
    "as the grids are the superimposition of two perpendicular straight line patterns , each of them can be considered as a periodic marking , whose change due to the deformation during the test is proportional to the sought in - plane displacement  @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the local phases along @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . in practice ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 are deduced from the grid images by calculating at any pixel the windowed fourier transform ( wft ) , see  @xcite , for which a gaussian window @xcite was employed in the present study .",
    "the possible appearance of local fictitious strains induced by slight grid printing defects was strongly reduced by using a motion compensation technique described in @xcite .",
    "the above measurement and data - treatment methods provide strain maps with a good compromise between strain resolution and spatial resolution , a key factor for distinguishing details in the strain maps .",
    "the spatial resolution of the technique , i.e.  the shortest distance between two independent measurements , is considered here to the equal to the width of the gaussian envelope used in the wft , which we consider equal to @xmath63 according to the classical 3-@xmath64 rule .",
    "as we set @xmath65 , which is the smallest value that can be chosen for @xmath64  @xcite , and as 5  pixels encode one grid pitch  @xmath66 , we obtain a spatial resolution equal to @xmath67 pixels in this study , that is , 1.2  mm on the sample .",
    "random noise propagating from the camera sensor is one of the main sources of disturbance in the strain maps . considering only the latter , and taking into account that the camera was set to average 128 frames to provide one grid image , a threshold equal to @xmath68 for @xmath35 has been estimated @xcite , and has been used to separate the avalanches within the noise floor in sect .",
    "[ section_4 ] .",
    " the same value has also been considered for the strain components @xmath13 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "correspondingly , for the average strain components and their variations , such as @xmath8 , @xmath30 , etc .",
    ", computed over a whole strain map , we have a lower threshold , as we rely on  @xmath69 measurements to calculate a single global quantity for each field .",
    "the obtained value was then rounded up to be equal @xmath70 , which was used as threshold for the analysis in sect .",
    "[ section_2 ] .",
    "the strain - increment maps show in some cases the presence of parasitic fringes , probably originating from a slight moir effect between grid and camera sensor .",
    "such quasi - periodic noise , for which there is at present no automatic elimination procedure available in the case of strain distributions @xcite , may shade some actual strain - map features , thus spuriously increasing the number of apparently independent strain avalanches .",
    "this undesirable effect constitutes one of the limits of the present analysis .",
    "we have however heuristically performed avalanche identification also by using thresholds for @xmath35 lower than the value @xmath68 pertaining to the sole sensor noise .",
    "we checked directly that this only minimally affects the statistical results reported in figs .",
    "10 - 13 , confirming their robustness .",
