    "recently , x - shaped radio galaxies ( xrgs)a peculiar class of radio galaxies with two pairs of misaligned lobes @xcite  have received significant attention as new observations have explored and critiqued the competing models for the origin of their odd morphology .",
    "the distinctive `` x '' shape occurs due to the intersection of two centro - symmetric synchrotron - emitting structures at a common nucleus ( e.g.  figure  [ 3c403 ] ) .",
    "one of these structures is associated with an active relativistic jet ( the `` primary '' lobes ) whereas the other is fainter , more ragged , and does not appear to harbor a jet ( the `` secondary '' lobes or `` wings '' ) .",
    "the wings can be long , collimated , and symmetric about the nucleus , and may even exhibit z - shaped morphology of their own @xcite .",
    "the origin of the wings is not presently understood , but xrgs share other characteristics which indicate a common origin .",
    "x - shaped sources make up about 510% of fanaroff - riley type  ii ( fr  ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the consensus sample is fairly small , but with the identification of @xmath0 `` candidate '' xrgs @xcite , a search for trends is now possible .",
    "based on the combined consensus and candidate sample , xrgs tend to have radio powers and host optical luminosities near the fr  i / ii `` break '' in a ledlow - owen radio power ",
    "visual magnitude @xcite type plot @xcite , and reside in elliptical galaxies with larger - than - average black hole masses ( inferred from the @xmath1 relation and broad lines from the active galactic nucleus ; * ? ? ?",
    "xrgs do not seem to be in galaxies currently undergoing a merger based on inferred starburst history @xcite and a spectroscopic search for broad emission lines and dusty nuclei @xcite , but the dynamic ages of their active lobes are younger than the age of the starburst @xcite .",
    "the wings are preferentially co - aligned with the _ minor _ axis of the host , whereas the primary lobes tend to be co - aligned with the major axis @xcite ; this alignment has been confirmed in the x - rays which trace the distribution of hot gas in and around the host galaxies that provides the working surface which shapes the radio galaxy @xcite . the radiative age of the wings does not seem to follow a clear trend , as some wings have steeper spectral indices than the primary lobes ( implying ageing ) whereas others do not @xcite .",
    "notably , some wings are actually longer than the primary lobes , and wings are only found in radio galaxies with strong bridges .",
    "a critical review of the observational data and existing models is found in @xcite ; here we briefly summarize the main threads .",
    "the origin of the secondary lobes has been attributed to ( i ) a rapid reorientation of the spin axis of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) powering the jet ( i.e. the wings are fossils ) , either due to a smbh merger ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or rapid precession ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) redirection and collimation of `` backflow '' ( spent jet plasma flowing back from the terminal shocks ) @xcite ; ( iii ) a binary agn @xcite ; and ( iv ) interaction of the jet with disturbed morphology ( e.g. stellar shells , phase - wrapped remnants of a merged disk galaxy ; * ? ? ?",
    "since xrgs are usually strongly bridged sources and are apparently aware of their environments , it is worth examining closely the hypothesis that the x - shaped morphology originates from an interaction between the radio galaxy and its environment . in this paper",
    ", we seek to test the viability of the _ backflow model _ with three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in elliptical atmospheres .",
    "[ 3c403 ]    in the backflow model , wings are produced by a single agn outburst with powerful jets as the backflow is diverted along the steepest pressure gradient of the surrounding atmosphere ( i.e. the minor axis ) .",
    "the wings either rise buoyantly or are driven in this direction @xcite or form as supersonic outflows along the direction of least resistance from a ruptured overpressured cocoon @xcite .",
    "these scenarios naturally explain the observed correlation between the wings and the minor axis as well as the dearth of strictly fr  i xrgs ( the weaker fr  i sources do not produce powerful back - flows ) .",
    "however , the backflow model faces significant challenges , most notably the very long wings in many xrgs ( often longer than the primary lobes ) . whereas powerful jets are expected to drive through the surrounding medium supersonically , wings which expand buoyantly",
    "would do so at most transonically for most of their lives @xcite .    because , in this model , fluid effects are primarily responsible for the `` x '' shape , hydrodynamic simulations are an ideal proving ground .",
    "although recent hydrodynamic simulations of radio galaxy morphology exist in the literature , ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most are not concerned with the formation of lateral asymmetries such as wings . in view of advances in simulating radio galaxies in the past decade , the mounting evidence that xrgs",
    "constitute a population demands a critical look at the backflow model with new simulations . in this paper",
    ", we discuss 3d hydrodynamic models of radio galaxies ignited in initially relaxed , elliptical atmospheres and examine how wings form .",
    "we begin by discussing our simulation setup and strategy for exploring wing production in section  2 , then present our model runs and describe the evolution of a generic winged source in section  3 . in particular , we find that favorable pressure gradients are necessary but not sufficient to produce an x - shaped source ; the character and time evolution of the jet is equally important . in section  4",
    ", we briefly discuss the missing and artificial physics in our simulations , and in section  5 we assess the backflow model in view of our results as well as discuss the implications for the broader picture of radio lobe morphology .",
    "finally , in section  6 we summarize our main results and conclusions .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the terms `` secondary lobes '' and `` wings '' interchangeably .",
    "we also use the term `` winged '' source to refer to any radio source with substantial symmetric off - axis distortions whereas `` x - shaped '' sources are a subset of winged sources with an axial wing - to - lobe length ratio of more than @xmath2 .",
    "this nomenclature reflects the view of the hydrodynamic model in which xrgs are indeed a subset of a broader category of distortions .",
    "finally , we use the term `` back - flows '' to refer specifically to actual fluid flows heading back to the nucleus from the jet heads , whereas we use `` backflow '' to refer to the material in these flows .",
    "we use a parallelized version of the zeus code @xcite for our hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "zeus is a second - order ( spatial accuracy ) eulerian finite - differencing magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) code which solves the standard equations of hydrodynamics , @xmath3 for an ideal compressible fluid and introduces artificial viscosity for shocks .",
    "the version we use , zeus - mpv2 , is based on the national center for supercomputing applications ( ncsa ) code described in @xcite .",
    "we use spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 ) in the purely hydrodynamical mode for all our runs ; the jets are therefore injected from an inner boundary sphere with some small , but finite , radius @xmath7 .",
    "we outline our basic simulation setup below , followed by our strategy for exploring winged sources and a description of the evolution of a standard double - lobed source for comparison .",
    "hydrodynamic and mhd simulations of radio galaxies interacting with their surroundings are common due to the possibility that energy deposited by the lobes is a mode of heating in agn feedback scenarios .",
    "we do not incorporate relativistic jet physics since we are primarily concerned with lobe mixing and evolution , but the robustness of this assumption is explored in section  4.1 .",
    "we note here that non - relativistic , light , hypersonic hydrodynamic jets reproduce several essential features of jets .",
    "these include recollimation shocks , terminal shocks at the jet head ( associated with radio `` hot spots '' ) and back - flows of spent material from the terminal shocks which sheath the jet and produce lobes . since we are interested in the evolution of back - flowing fluid in anisotropic environments , we adopt a non - relativistic purely hydrodynamic scheme .",
    "we inject the jets as bi - directional flows into an initially hydrostatic , ellipsoidal atmosphere .",
    "the atmospheres we set up are ellipsoids with a polytropic equation of state ( @xmath8 ) and a 3d @xmath9-model density profile @xcite given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the core radius , and @xmath13 is the core density . to adapt this model for elliptical atmospheres",
    ", we make the radial density profile dependent on angle by adding a major - axis position angle pa and ellipticity @xmath14 to the atmosphere , which we denote as @xmath15 for an elliptical atmosphere . to easily allow for triaxial atmospheres",
    ", we define the ellipsoid in cartesian space ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and break up @xmath14 along each axis , then transform back to spherical coordinates to obtain the radius @xmath15 using the grid coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) : @xmath19\\\\ y_e & = & r \\sin(\\theta)\\biggl[\\sin(\\phi)cos(\\text{pa})-\\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\text{pa})\\biggr]\\\\ z_e & = & r \\cos(\\theta)\\biggl[\\cos(\\text{pa } ) + \\sin(\\text{pa})\\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where pa is nominally measured clockwise from the @xmath20-axis ( in practice , it is only the difference between the jet axis and the major axis of the ellipsoid that matters ) . to normalize the size of the atmosphere , @xmath21 in equation  5",
    "is defined as the largest value of @xmath14 along each axis .",
    "for example , an atmosphere with large @xmath22 is elongated along the @xmath20-axis",
    ". equations  4 and 5 may be understood as saying that introducing @xmath14 changes the effective core radius along a given axis : @xmath23 .",
    "for example , if @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , then along the @xmath20-axis @xmath27 and along the @xmath28-axis @xmath29 .",
    "this phrasing is convenient when comparing the major and minor axes rather than the quantities along the full range of angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 and we use it hereafter .",
    "the atmospheres are initially set up in hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath30 assuming that the background dark matter potential is static and dominant so that the gas self - gravity is not important .",
    "we define the adiabatic sound speed @xmath31 in code units and set up an isothermal atmosphere so the potential @xmath32 is @xmath33 since xrgs are powerful radio galaxies and exist at low redshift , we assume a smooth intergalactic / intracluster medium ( igm / icm ) and gas - poor systems , i.e. no disk of colder ( i.e. atomic or molecular ) material in the host ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "we note that in several exploratory runs , additional atmospheric complexity is overlaid onto a smooth atmosphere with no change in the gravitational potential @xmath32 , i.e. not initially in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the jets in our simulations are hypersonic ( @xmath34100@xmath35 ) light ( @xmath36 ) flows injected in pressure equilibrium with the ambient material from back - to - back circular footpoints on the small inner boundary sphere at the origin .",
    "the kinetic luminosity of the jets is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the area of the footpoint at @xmath7 , and ignoring higher order contributions from the gravitational energy or thermal flux .",
    "to tune @xmath39 we primarily vary @xmath40 because ( i ) @xmath39 is most sensitive to changes in @xmath40 , ( ii ) the jets must be `` light '' to ensure that the kelvin - helmholtz instability growth rate at the boundary of the cocoon is approximately the same as in the relativistic case @xcite , and ( iii ) jets are highly collimated .",
    "the maximum jet width is constrained by high - resolution x - ray observations of jet knots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "typical values are @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 . in agreement with other work ,",
    "these jets develop a cylindrical core of fast - moving material sheathed in a slower concentric shell continuous at the boundaries with the surrounding material and core .",
    "we use a grid with zones spaced according to a geometric series in @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( 256 bins each ) and uniformly in @xmath6 ( 64 bins ) .",

    "the @xmath5 grid is broken into two symmetric 128-bin components with the smallest zones near the poles where the jets are injected .",
    "the adequacy of our grid is demonstrated by a run with double the resolution in each direction which produces similar internal jet structure .",
    "mixing is not substantially different at the lobe boundaries .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath6 direction and reflecting boundary conditions in @xmath5 .",
    "the outer @xmath4 boundary at @xmath52 has outflow conditions ( material leaving the grid ) ; likewise , outflow conditions exist for all @xmath7 zones except where the jets are injected .",

    "code units are transformed to physical units by choosing appropriate values for @xmath12 , @xmath35 , and @xmath13 .",

    "would then have a physical speed between @xmath62 ( a lorentz factor of @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , comparing classical and relativistic jet simulations requires careful matching of parameters , in particular the mass - energy density content of the jet .",
    "hence , the jet velocities chosen should not be taken directly as assumptions of true jet velocity .",
    "our runs were parallelized and used variety of processors .",
    "many of the runs were conducted on quad - core intel@xmath64 core@xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67  ghz workstations .",
    "we now outline our guiding strategy to determine whether x - shaped sources can result from the interaction of radio galaxy lobes with their environment .",
    "first , we only model powerful fr  ii sources which produce strong back - flows . neither the physical origin of the fr  i / ii dichotomy nor the differences between jets in radio loud and radio quiet sources are understood , but the higher luminosity fr  iis exhibit the hot spots , well defined lobes , and bridges exploited by the backflow model .",
    "in accordance with the observations @xcite , we inject jets along the major axis of the surrounding atmosphere .",
    "we first use unrealistic atmospheres with very favorable pressure gradients for wing production ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then explore jet and atmosphere parameters to study the production and characteristics of xrgs .",
    "in particular , we explore the dependence of wing formation on jet width , density , and kinetic luminosity as a function of time , and initial atmosphere parameters ( core radius , density , ellipticity , and position angle ) .",
    "although some parameter combinations are degenerate , this is a very large parameter space because the @xmath68 may include dead time and intermittency .",
    "compared to 2d modeling , our 3d simulations eliminate the requirement of axisymmetry which enhances the jet head advance speed @xcite and the coherence of the back - flows .",
    "the effect of turbulence is also more realistically explored in three dimensions .    motivated by the expectation that pressure gradients affect the wings fundamentally the same way in different systems , we start from the ansatz that jet and atmospheric parameters are orthogonal . in other words ,",
    "the jet parameters may be tuned in some fiducial atmosphere and the atmosphere parameters may be tuned with some fiducial jet such that the behavior of an arbitrary jet in an arbitrary atmosphere can be inferred .",
    "on the basis of this method we will evaluate the factors key to wing prominence and the viability of the backflow models .",
    "[ coevol ]      if wings are distortions to a generic double - lobed source , we expect our simulated radio galaxies to strongly resemble the double - lobed sources produced by earlier models .",
    "hydrodynamic and mhd models of jets are commonly employed to study either the phenomenology of the jets and lobes ( with relativistic and nonrelativistic fluids ) or the energy deposited by the lobes into their environment .",
    "hence , a large body of work concerned with phenomenological models of these sources exists and has produced key insights into the life of a powerful radio source .",
    "these studies include work on early jet / lobe evolution in a relaxed atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "naturally , there is overlap between the phenomenological studies and those motivated by the challenge to produce jets which prevent a cooling catastrophe in the icm of a host galaxy cluster by isotropizing energy distribution .",
    "the viability of radio galaxies as agn feedback mechanisms is beyond the scope of this work , but jet lifetime and the passive evolution of `` dead '' radio galaxies @xcite place important constraints on wing prominence .",
    "based on this work , we understand a powerful double - lobed source to have three distinct phases of evolution : ( i ) _ ignition _ , in which a spheroidal cocoon of relativistic plasma is formed around the nascent jets , ( ii ) the _ active phase _ , wherein the jet produces the cigar - shaped lobes associated with fr  ii radio galaxies , and ( iii ) the _ passive phase _ where lobes evolve after the jet is turned off . below we outline these phases for a preliminary hydrodynamical simulation of a fast ( @xmath70 ) , light jet with large @xmath39 ( a `` fr  ii '' source ) to provide a framework for discussing the evolution of winged sources ( left - hand panels of figure  [ coevol ] ) .",

    "the jet is injected in pressure equilibrium with the initially relaxed surrounding medium .",
    "the flow quickly forms and drives a spheroidal bow shock into the surrounding medium ( figure  [ coevol ] , top left panel ) . at the location where the jet impacts the shock , back - flows",
    "develop which fill the space evacuated by the bow shock with light , hot spent jet plasma .",
    "this plasma forms a cocoon which sheaths the jet . at very early times",
    "the jet expands laterally , since it is unconfined by the cocoon plasma ( in part due to the initially conical shape of the jet ) and the expansion of the nascent radio galaxy is nearly self - similar @xcite .",
    "however , as a result , the early back - flows acquire a circulatory motion and flow along the inner edge of the bow shock ( figure  [ backflow ] , top panel ) . by the time these flows reach the midplane between the two jets , they have velocity vectors pointing radially inwards and do not collide with back - flows from the counter - jet @xcite . in our models , the back - flows are also prevented from interacting with their counterparts from the counter - jet because our jets are injected into pristine atmospheres such that at very early times , each jet inflates its own cocoon .",
    "the two cocoons are both bounded by a bow shock , and the two shocks meet at the midplane between the jets and form an interstice of dense material that prevents early mixing ( figure  [ backflow ] , top panel ) .",
    "whether such an interstice is present in real sources is not clear ( we do not resolve the very earliest jet stages such as the  flood - and - channel  phase seen in a clumpy , warm disk in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the interstice is ablated and the cocoon is unified by the active phase .",
    "as the cocoon pressure builds due to backflow confined by the bow shocks , the jet becomes azimuthally confined and a recollimation shock appears near the injection point ; by the end of the ignition phase , the cocoon is strongly overpressured relative to its environment . at the same time , the terminal shock becomes increasingly distinct from the bow shock , and the jet head takes on the characteristic double - pronged appearance of a 3d hydrodynamical jet .",
    "while the back - flows still follow the bow shocks during the late ignition phase , they are increasingly straight .",
    "we note that this early evolution is seen in all our runs and does not depend much on atmosphere or jet parameters , nor on the boundary conditions ( as long as the core radius of the atmosphere @xmath12 is much larger than @xmath7 ) .",

    "this weak shock ( @xmath71 ) sweeps up a large amount of material as it expands and becomes better described as a strong sound wave ( figure  [ coevol ] ) .",

    "hydrodynamic wings are formed in two stages .",
    "first , during the ignition phase ( section  2.3 ) , the overpressured cocoon expands faster along the minor axis due to the steeper pressure gradient and forms small channels ( proto - wings ) perpendicular to the jet into which back - flowing plasma flows .",
    "the proto - wings produced in this way can account for 2040% of wing length at the end of the active phase depending on the gradient .",
    "second , during the active phase , the wings rise buoyantly , fed by turbulent flows near the midplane .",
    "although the back - flows near the jet heads are initially laminar and supersonic ( relative to the lobe material ) , they quickly decelerate and do not enter the wings as coherent flows ; the wings expand subsonically .    during the active phase",
    "the wings evolve almost independently of the cocoon . hence ,",
    "once wings have developed , their length depends only on the properties of the native atmosphere whereas the length of the jet - fed primary lobes is dominated by the properties of the jet ( in particular the kinetic luminosity as a function of time ) for powerful jets .",

    "we describe how wings fit into this process in detail below , referencing our standard ( extremal ) atmosphere ( run  standard , tables  [ atmostable ] and [ jettable ] ) . while unrealistic , this atmosphere provides important insights into the backflow model and can be directly compared to prior work @xcite .",

    "although these channels need not be produced by an overpressured cocoon , some channels must exist for wings to form .",
    "the degree of cocoon expansion in a given direction depends on the pressure gradient experienced in that direction , and hence on the atmospheric parameters .",

    "the backflow model has difficulty producing wings when a weak agn suddenly becomes more powerful because an overpressured cocoon only forms when the jet is completely confined by the atmosphere .",
    "these runs can , however , produce something akin to z - shaped morphology by virtue of the lobes escaping the densest regions of the atmosphere before the powerful jet turns on .",
    "we have briefly investigated the potential for gas - rich `` stellar shells '' from minor mergers located periodically along the major axis to produce wings ( motivated by * ? ? ?",

    "we mean jets which experience multiple outbursts during the run and which are essentially in an `` on '' state or an `` off '' state . generally , we find that rapid intermittency has the effect of suppressing wing formation and results in much more regular cocoons ( in terms of their projected morphology ) than single outbursts . on the other hand ,",
    "ragged cocoons are produced by long periods of dead time . in neither case",
    "are wings promoted , as each successive brief outburst deposits most of its thrust at the ends of the lobes , far from the midplane .",
    "the chief reason why such intermittency does not produce prominent wings is that wings expand subsonically .",
    "since the duty cycles of the intermittent jets are much shorter than the crossing time , the cocoon expands as if a moderately powerful jet of constant velocity were powering it . unlike in single decaying outbursts ,",
    "the intermittent jets deposit most of their thrust far from the midplane . on the other hand , intermittency on the timescale of an @xmath167-folding time of a decaying jet can be effective .",
    "because we have only solved the equations of hydrodynamics in evolving our simple models , it is worth considering the impact of additional complexity .",
    "our models do not include magnetic fields , special relativity , or radiative losses , and our simple setup does not take into account complex jet or atmospheric structure , feedback , and other processes that may be important to radio galaxy morphology . in practice , we do not believe these omissions invalidate our results .",
    "for example , special relativity and magnetic fields must play crucial roles in determining the character and transverse structure of the jet , but we only insist that our simulated jets reproduce the collimation , hot spots , and back - flows of fr  ii sources .",
    "in other respects ( e.g. radiative efficiency ) , the jet and agn are inside a `` black box . '' because we are concerned with the behavior of lobe material , we believe these omissions are justified .    likewise , radiative losses ( depleting of lobe energy via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering ) only become important relative to adiabatic losses at late times and are not in a position to influence the formation of wings .",
    "radiative losses from the icm are also irrelevant on the timescales of agn outbursts , so feedback ( the connection of jet power to the amount of material crossing the inner boundary ) resulting from cluster cooling is unimportant on these timescales . as to feedback from _ backflow _",
    "@xcite , there is no obvious recipe to describe what happens to the mass flowing across the inner boundary , since the inner boundary radius is much larger than the nuclear engine , but as the back - flows straighten , less material will have velocity vectors pointing towards the origin and eventually the agn would cease to be `` fed '' by backflow . this is consistent with our entirely artificial recipe for decaying jets .    on the other hand , magnetic fields",
    "( that must be injected with the jet ) and relativistic jets ( which have a higher thrust for a given mass - energy density ) may strongly influence the behavior of lobe material .",
    "toroidal magnetic fields may help collimate the backflow and retard its mixing ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent continuity of fields in some wings ( e.g. ngc  326 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is suggestive , especially considering that in our models the lack of collimation leads to wide wings .",
    "however , @xcite find in simulations of fr  ii sources that turbulence sets in within the cocoon even when ordered fields existed earlier , so it is unclear that the magnetic fields in the wings are actually toroidal . as to the realism of the _ jet _ , it is not our goal to understand the jet physics in detail , but we note the persistence of experimental hypersonic fluid jets in recent work by @xcite , which the authors use to argue that magnetic collimation is only required near the base of the jet .",
    "the importance of relativistic jets to the cocooon morphology is unclear .",
    "@xcite find that , for jets matched by velocity , pressure , radius and power , relativistic jets produce preferentially wider cocoons than classical ones .",
    "the authors suggest that this effect may be accounted for by the higher thrust in the relativistic case .",
    "however , @xcite find the opposite when using the same matching conditions : relativistic jets tend to produce narrower cocoons compared to classical jets ( more specifically , jets with a higher lorentz factor have smaller cocoons ) . without matched relativistic simulations",
    "it is impossible to directly test the importance of special relativity on our cocoon sizes , but it is remarkable that @xcite and @xcite agree that the qualitative nature of the cocoon is unchanged . including relativity may modify @xmath104 but would not fundamentally change the appearance of our winged sources because relativistic physics in the lobes would not change the processes which produce wings .",
    "in other words , we believe that special relativity is a second - order effect akin to magnetic fields .",
    "it is worth asking whether wings form only because our atmospheres are `` smooth '' , i.e. because we have not included turbulence in the icm or structure near the center ( where the environment is presumably complex ) .",
    "this question is particularly important given the observed interactions between jets and molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , stellar shells ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gas in companion galaxies @xcite , and more generally the complex nuclear environments of active galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "to this end , we have introduced density perturbations mimicking stellar shells along the major axis at various intervals , tested the impact of a single ring near the nucleus , and introduced kolmogorov - spectrum turbulence to the icm .",
    "none of these structures alter the same basic evolution of winged sources .",
    "additional jet physics would need to be in place in order to determine whether the jet itself can be bent by interaction with high density pockets @xcite .",
    "all of these tests use density perturbations with a maximum amplitude of the core density @xmath13 .",
    "finally , bulk flows in clusters are clearly important to radio galaxy structure @xcite , although most xrgs are large , strongly bridged sources in which this may not be a defining effect .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is worth considering the impact of boundary conditions and the jet structure on the morphology of the lobes  our setup is designed to produce lobes like those of radio galaxies with physics and conditions inherently different from those encountered in nature . the mixing experienced by the lobes is also artificial ( naturally set by the size of the grid zones , which vary along @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , but mixing is too slow a process to suppress the formation of wings .",
    "the inner boundary is the most significant artifact of our simulation because it represents no physical analog but rather allows us to hide the agn and the jet collimation mechanism .",
    "in addition , backflow crossing the boundary slows down and disappears .",
    "this has two consequences : not all the backflow can be harnessed , and flows may be effectively directed around the boundary by eddies as slowing backflow crosses the boundary . in the first case , the amount of material is to small to influence the wings . in the second , we find that the inner boundary must be small compared to @xmath12 ( keeping the physical size of the jets fixed ) in order to prevent the initial cocoon from being unduly influenced by the sphere .",
    "inner boundary spheres which are too large tend to promote material flowing around them , hence promoting early wings , but suppress midplane mergers and hence the prominence of later wings .",
    "the initial interstices also survive for longer for oversized @xmath7 . for typical atmospheres ( @xmath168 )",
    ", @xmath7 must be somewhat smaller than 0.1  code units ; @xmath49 is a compromise between a small impact on the initial cocoon and reasonably sized grid zones . runs with @xmath169",
    "do not appear substantially different from those with @xmath49 , and the timestep is unreasonably small .",
    "we precess the jet injection footpoints rapidly ( @xmath44  hz ) in a very tight circle around the poles in order to break up the jet symmetry and spread its thrust out over a larger working surface .",
    "we only require that our jet reproduce internal features seen in other hydrodynamic simulations along with the terminal shocks that give rise to the back - flows and lobes . without breaking up the jets",
    ", the jet head travels very quickly and produces unrealistic lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in mhd simulations we would expect helical instabilities to break up the jet .",
    "our precession scheme is thus an artifice that is motivated by observables but whose recipe is not an attempt to model a physical process ( c.f .",
    "however , one might worry about its influence on backflow and wings because the precession angle is a free parameter ( subject to the condition that @xmath43 ) .",
    "in other words , we can tune the width of the lobes and the rate of growth of the radio galaxy within some narrow range of parameters . since stalling the jet head contributes to wing prominence via shortening the active lobes ,",
    "is the axial ratio @xmath104 artificially high ?",
    "we do not believe so .",
    "even with tiny precession angles , we form long wings in highly eccentric atmospheres ( the only atmospheres where long wings form ) . moreover",
    ", the jet head advance speed also depends on the kinetic luminosity as a function of time .",
    "we have successfully produced winged and x - shaped sources solely by redirecting back - flow with static environmental pressure gradients , and are now in a position to compare our simulated sources to observed xrgs ( figure  [ gallery ] ) in order to critique proposed wing formation mechanisms involving back - flows . in these models ,",
    "wings are produced as plasma flowing back from the jet heads is deflected into a direction misaligned with the jets .",
    "how this deflection occurs is uncertain @xcite , and until now the backflow model has not been rigorously investigated with three - dimensional simulations .",
    "here we outline a series of predictions ( expectations ) for properties which are , at least in principle , observable if our simulations are an adequate representation of wing formation .",

    "intermittency is another important prediction of our models for observed xrgs , but the action of intermittency in our simulations may represent a more complex underlying process .",
    "intermittency on timescales similar to the @xmath167-folding time of a decaying jet ( near the early passive phase ) is effective in our simulations because it allows the jet to bypass the overpressured cocoon stage and form a bow shock within the radio lobe itself , thereby depositing a large amount of backflow into the wings from a very powerful jet close to the wing bases .",
    "reinjection is effective in a relatively narrow window of time ( 310  myr depending on the size of the radio galaxy , e.g. figure  [ standardgrowth ] ) between the active and passive phases , but this may be plausible : the ripples in the perseus cluster @xcite and abell  2052 @xcite do imply an agn duty cycle of about 10  myr .",
    "this is consistent with our simulated sources between 50100  kpc across .",
    "thus , it is conceivable that regular intermittency is a viable mechanism for enhancing wings , although we note that if the intermittency is very rapid or very slow , it is ineffective ( section  3.2 ) . on the other hand",
    ", intermittency could be replaced in our models by any mechanism which drives back - flows nearer the base of the wings such as the motion of denser ism into the path of the jet .",
    "we note that intermittency may also be effective for wings attached to the primary lobes farther from the nucleus ; a reinjected jet quickly re - establishes the cocoon and drives strong back - flows along its length as it rapidly reaches the prior hot spot .",
    "if the jet reinjected is similar to the outburst which initially formed the wings , we would still expect xrgs mostly to be weak fr  ii sources .",

    "this behavior persists at lower ( mhz ) frequencies and is therefore not obviously attributable to spectral ageing , although spectral ageing may be in play for some xrgs @xcite .",
    "our models expect the wings to be fainter because they are substantially wider than the collimated primary lobes yet contain ( in most cases ) less lobe material .",
    "we therefore suppose that the wing material spreads out and decreases the magnetic field energy density @xmath183 .    assuming that @xmath183 decreases with increasing volume ( i.e. assuming something like equipartition conditions , although precise equipartition is not required )",
    ", the synchrotron emissivity in the wings will be substantially smaller than that in the lobes .",
    "in other words , `` spherical '' wings a factor of @xmath184 wider than the active lobes will have a factor of @xmath185 smaller @xmath183 than in the lobes . in optically thin conditions ( a good assumption ) , the surface brightness obtained from integrating through the wings only recovers a factor of @xmath184 in the wings , so we expect them to be a factor of @xmath186 dimmer than the active lobes ( more generally , the square of the ratio between the wing width and the lobe width ) for electrons of the same @xmath187 .",
    "of course , in projection the wings may appear even dimmer since the lobes will tend to be shortened and therefore increase in surface brightness ( ignoring relativistic dimming of the counterjet ) whereas the wings will not .",
    "clearly , this prediction rests on a number of assumptions not included in our models and is therefore somewhat weak .",
    "since the wings are filled with turbulent plasma , it is also possible that the magnetic field strength is increased by winding up of fields as the material mixes .",
    "moreover , the jet power ( and therefore the back - flow speed ) is time dependent in our simulations , so the ratio between the surface brightness of the lobes and the wings would be time dependent in our model as well .",
    "nonetheless , the diffusion of material in the wings and the aforementioned projection effects seem likely to dim the wings in the backflow model .

    "this cocoon expands asymmetrically because of the asymmetric pressure gradients and forms proto - wings which are later bolstered by the merger of laminar back - flows near the midplane sending material into the wings during the active phase .",
    "the laminar back - flows themselves are ineffective at drilling new channels . during the overpressured phase they acquire a vorticity near the terminal shocks that leads them to follow the contact discontinuity of the cocoon and ultimately flow back towards the agn ( figure  [ backflow ] ) . during the active phase",
    ", they are mostly straight and flow towards the midplane .",
    "lobe material is also ineffective at producing channels because it follows the path of least resistance : in a confined ellipsoidal cocoon , it will simply spread out to increase the pressure throughout the cocoon rather than break out in a particular direction .",
    "this can be seen in the false synchrotron maps in figure  [ coevol ] .",
    "these maps assume equipartition and are not indicative of what the sources would look like in the ghz bands .",
    "rather , they effectively trace pressure in the cocoon , and it is easy to see that the pressure in the confined cocoon on the left side of the figure remains high relative to the x - shaped source ( the false radio maps use the same scale ) .",
    "apart from proto - wings produced by the early pressure - driven expansions , kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities produce channels which backflow reinforces . given sufficient time and a powerful jet , these whorls and fingers can become wings in their own right , but likewise this is due to the growth of the instabilities and buoyancy rather than redirected laminar back - flows .    notably , some sources exhibit wings which do _ not _ emanate from the center or are unlikely to have been produced via an overpressured cocoon ( e.g. ngc  326 ) . because it is difficult to channel the back - flows",
    ", we hypothesize that if the backflow model is correct , some seed proto - wing was necessary to produce such sources .",
    "the origin of these proto - wings is unclear .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    related to the expectation that back - flows are not directly responsible for drilling channels is the prediction that the wings of radio galaxies expand subsonically for most of their lifetimes ( figures  [ backflow ] and [ wingvel ] ) .",
    "this expectation is contrary to the @xcite `` overpressured cocoon '' and @xcite or @xcite `` buoyant backflow '' proposals in the literature ( section  1 ) and poses a serious problem for the backflow model in terms of explaining long wings .",
    "we therefore discuss this point in some detail below .",
    "the problem of subsonic expansion can be broken into two distinct objections : ( 1 ) if the wings grow subsonically while the primary lobes grow supersonically , how can wings be longer than the lobes ? and ( 2 ) subsonic expansion implies wing lifetimes of more than 100  myr for sources hundreds of kpc across .",
    "the first objection is easier to reconcile with our models because our jets provide a natural mechanism for the subsonic expansion of the lobes , and it is not clear whether most radio galaxies ( even powerful ones ) really do expand very supersonically .",
    "further , as we have noted , projection tends to enhance wings .",
    "however , the lifetimes of large sources are more difficult to explain .    to see this , consider that for a rich cluster atmosphere with @xmath188  kev ( this corresponds to a @xmath189  km  s@xmath45 or , conveniently , @xmath117  kpc  myr@xmath45 ) , subsonic growth implies that wings 100  kpc from base - to - tip would be at least 100  myr old . in group environments ,",
    "where @xmath190  km  s@xmath45 and monotonically declines at large radii @xcite , the longest observed wings ( e.g. 3c  315 whose wings span @xmath191  kpc ) could be almost 500  myr old ! even if agn activity persisted this long , synchrotron cooling might set in : if the bulk flows of replenishing backflow travel at a lobe sound speed @xmath192 , they would take between 20100  myr to replenish the leading edges of the wings . depending on the break frequency and assuming magnetic fields in equipartition ( @xmath193 of a few @xmath194 g ) and a lorentz factor @xmath187 of several@xmath195",
    ", this may easily exceed the radiative cooling time .    to solve this problem",
    ", variations of the backflow model require that the wings actually do expand supersonically . in the `` overpressured cocoon '' model @xcite , supersonic wing growth",
    "is achieved through sustained pressure - driven expansion , whereas in the `` buoyant backflow '' model @xcite , wings are driven by the nearly free expansion of diverted hypersonic back - flows .",
    "our models reproduce overpressured cocoons and hypersonic back - flows , but the overall wing advance speed is subsonic .    for the overpressured cocoon model to produce long wings , a sustained overpressured state",
    "must be maintained to drive outflows .",
    "however , in our models the highly overpressured cocoon that forms soon after ignition quickly expands to reach pressure equilibrium : the supersonic expansion phase lasts at most around 15% of the lifetime of the radio galaxy regardless of the jet we inject ( e.g. figure  [ wingvel ] ) .",
    "as the radius of the ( isobaric ) cocoon grows , its pressure falls much more rapidly than does that of the surrounding atmosphere at a similar radius ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* figure  2 in their paper ) , so the advance speed of the lateral cocoon expansion falls precipitously from a peak of about mach  2 .",
    "thus , overpressured expansion appears to be relevant only very early in the life of the source and by itself can produce only short wings",
    ". indeed , this conclusion is supported by earlier simulations @xcite where even in advantageous triaxial atmospheres , the overpressured cocoon produced at most an intrinsic @xmath104 of @xmath196 ( the jets in their work were held at constant velocity and @xmath104 would thus decrease over time ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the overpressured state may instead result from backflow piling up upon reaching the central ( dense ) region of the galaxy .",
    "our models do not support this scenario , since the cocoon is contiguous and nearly isobaric throughout the active phase .",
    "the buoyant backflow model argues that a combination of buoyancy forces and wings driven by hypersonic flows produce large x - shaped sources .",
    "for instance , @xcite estimate that the current outburst in 3c  403 ( figure  [ 3c403 ] ) started 16  myr ago . if this outburst was solely responsible for generating the @xmath0  kpc wings hydrodynamically ( as preferred by * ? ? ? * ) , the average expansion speed of the wings would have to be @xmath197  km  s@xmath45 ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "in contrast , a typical sound speed for galaxy groups is @xmath190  km  s@xmath45 , a factor of @xmath199 smaller .",
    "likewise , @xcite prefer hypersonic expansion . what could drive such wings ?",
    "the answer invoked by these authors is redirected back - flows , which can be accelerated at the terminal hot spots up to a few percent of @xmath200 ( based on the spectral ageing  distance method of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observational inference of high backflow speeds is consistent with our models and others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which find back - flow speeds of about twice the lobe sound speed ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "further , @xcite argue that the collimated morphologies of some wings requires some driving force .",
    "however , it is not evident that these laminar back - flows can be harnessed to drive wing expansion ( see the prior prediction ) .",
    "subsonic wing growth in our simulations is a natural consequence of the tendency of backflow ( lobe material ) to mix and expand .",
    "the fast back - flows from the terminal shocks merge near the midplane , dissipating their speed and driving flows into the wings which are subsonic relative to the low - density material in the lobes ( figure  [ backflow ] ) , although they are still supersonic relative to the background .",
    "these flows then expand and decelerate further in the wings , dissipating their thrust over a very large area . hence , detection of @xmath201  km  s@xmath45 flows in the wings would be insufficient evidence for hypersonic wing expansion .",
    "supersonic wing expansion would require collimation to prevent thrust dissipation .",
    "can a collimation mechanism be found ?",
    "an obvious possibility we have not included is ordered magnetic fields , since particles can move along them much more easily than across , but @xcite find that in fr  ii sources , lobe magnetic fields become turbulent on timescales of @xmath202  myr .",
    "more generally , we note that ( weak ) shocks found around double - lobed radio sources often imply cocoon expansion near mach  1 .",
    "if a powerful jet can not drive highly supersonic expansion , it seems unlikely that less powerful , more disorganized backflow could do so .",
    "lastly , it is important to emphasize that subsonic expansion is only a serious problem for very large wings or very young agn with a large @xmath104 ratio .",
    "our simulations can reproduce most winged and x - shaped sources with subsonic expansion if the agn outburst is between 10100  myr old instead of 110  myr .",
    "these simulations are also not the final word , as they only solve the equations of hydrodynamics in a relaxed , non - dynamic atmosphere .",
    "our results , taken in context , strongly implicate a hydrodynamic origin for x - shaped sources and a common origin for winged and x - shaped sources .",
    "we can produce bona fide xrgs ( i.e. with intrinsic @xmath203 ) with a single outburst from a jet with a plausible time dependent kinetic luminosity on timescales broadly consistent with observed sources .",
    "the radio galaxies we produce are consistent with prior simulations , and faithful reproductions of observed radio galaxies can be generated by tuning the viewing angle ( figure  [ gallery ] ) .",
    "these sources are also consistent with most observed properties of the xrg population outlined above , and our simulations reproduce elements of the overpressured cocoon and buoyant backflow models while relying solely on the interaction of the radio lobe material with an anisotropic environment .",
    "hence , the backflow model remains a strong contender for the origin of xrgs  it would be surprising if some xrgs were _ not _ produced in this manner .",
    "however , our simulations also present new challenges to the proposals in the literature : we find that long wings require unusually elliptical atmospheres and expand subsonically , making very long wings difficult to explain .",
    "having examined the deficiencies of our simulations , we can not identify an obvious internal remedy ; we note that pre - existing channels are necessary ( in the backflow model ) for some sources in the literature and may be generally important .",
    "the final prediction of our simulations is therefore that the xrg population is heterogenous and _ the backflow model works in tandem with other hydrodynamic models rather than solely on its own . _ in short , this is because our models make it too difficult to produce xrgs given their observed frequency .",
    "consider that winged and x - shaped sources make up 510% of double - lobed radio sources .",
    "if , as in our models , x - shaped sources are produced by a fortunate coincidence of jet geometry , ism ellipticity , and jet power , we might imagine that the fraction of x - shaped sources is some function of each of these variables . in the simplest case , where each of these factors contribute independently to promoting wings , the fraction of xrgs might look like @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the fraction of double - lobed sources which are x - shaped and the other @xmath206 values represent the fraction of sources for each variable which meet the threshold criterion for wings .",
    "the exponents are unknown measures of the relative importance of each variable .",
    "obviously , the fraction of xrgs must be smaller than the fraction of sources which meet any one criterion .",
    "now , consider that virtually all double - lobed radio galaxies emanate from elliptical hosts , and have apparently random jet ",
    "major axis orientations ( as opposed to the very weakest radio - emitting agn whose jets seem to be pointed along the minor axis of their hosts ; * ? ? ?",
    "our models suggest that a jet within @xmath179 of the major axis of its host is required to produce wings . in a uniform distribution of radio jet position angles",
    ", we would thus expect that @xmath207 .",
    "assuming all powerful jets have a kinetic luminosity function conducive to forming xrgs , we still require about half of all sources where the jet is co - aligned with the major axis to have high ellipticity ( assuming the exponents are all equal to unity ) .",
    "given that ellipticity is clearly a very sensitive parameter and that the peak @xmath14 of powerful radio galaxy hosts is far below the wing threshold @xcite , it is clear that our simulations ( in this oversimplified formulation ) underpredict the observed frequency of winged sources . in other words , wings are _ too difficult _ to make in our models .    to reconcile this result with the observations , either our models must be fundamentally deficient with respect to the behavior of backflow or they require alternate mechanisms to form proto - wing channels such as the jet  stellar shell interaction model of @xcite or the jet  merging ism explanation for z - shaped sources in @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , backflowing material reinforces any proto - wings and can turn them into full - fledged wings if the original mechanism fails to do so ; making the channels in the first place is what the backflow model can not easily do .",
    "thus , we propose that the backflow model has a commensal relationship with other hydrodynamic mechanisms for forming wings by reinforcing and growing any pre - existing channels accessible to a jet pointed along the major axis of its host galaxy .",
    "these channels would naturally grow most easily along the steepest pressure gradient . in cases",
    "where the jet power and atmosphere size match appropriately , these channels would be produced by the expansion of an overpressured cocoon as in our simulations .",
    "in other cases , channels could be produced by the interaction of the jet with structure in the ism or by minor mergers . in this scenario",
    ", we would still expect to see most of the predictions of our simulations listed above for the case of pure backflow in a relaxed atmosphere .      at this point",
    ", it is worth revisiting the buoyant backflow model as phrased in @xcite , where xrgs are unified with other distortions to the canonical fr  ii model ( about two thirds of strongly bridged radio galaxies show central distortions ) by the deflection of backflow around a denser medium .",
    "these distortions may also be related to radio galaxies with interrupted bridges by the `` superdisk '' model @xcite , in which gas displaced by a galaxy merger is believed responsible for docking the lobes in an asymmetric manner .    because the backflow model as expressed in our simulations depends only on a fortuitous combination of atmosphere morphology and jet behavior to produce winged sources",
    ", we can indeed reproduce the basic bridge distortions of @xcite . however , we can not reproduce long z - shaped sources and some asymmetric distortions which do not appear to be the result of bulk motion or cluster turbulence .",
    "these include sources with a single wing on one side , sources with wings which themselves bend dramatically , sources with one fr  i lobe and one fr  ii lobe ( hymors ; * ? ? ?",
    "again , the main hindrance seems to be the inability to channel backflow ; jets which bend may solve this problem .",
    "although there are elements of the behavior of backflow which we do not presently understand , we come to the same conclusion as with x - shaped sources : the backflow model can account for other bridged distortions only in tandem with another hydrodynamic mechanism .",
    "we have conducted a series of three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of light , hypersonic jets to study the viability of the backflow model for the formation of wings in x - shaped radio galaxies .",
    "the xrgs seem to be a population unto themselves , with characteristic environmental geometry , radio power , black hole mass , etc .",
    ", and any successful model must account for these peculiarities .",
    "our main results follow .    1",
    ".   the jets , back - flows , and lobes in our simulations are similar to those in the recent literature , giving us confidence in the usefulness of our simulations as probes of the backflow model .",
    "2 .   wings in our models form in two stages : the establishment of channels or proto - wings and then buoyant ( usually subsonic ) expansion .",
    "specifically , our models corroborate the overpressured cocoon model of @xcite early on , but as cocoons quickly come to pressure equilibrium with their surroundings , most of the wing length represents subsonic expansion ( figure  [ backflow ] ) .",
    "we have produced prominent wings by geometry and radio power alone , proving that the backflow model can , in principle , make x - shaped sources ( figure  [ coevol ] and [ gallery ] ) .",
    "both the atmosphere and jet kinetic luminosity as a function of time are crucial to forming x - shaped sources .",
    "long wings are produced in a relatively small portion of parameter space , requiring galaxies with high ellipticity , decaying jets , proper jet orientation , and appropriate atmosphere size ( figures  [ atmosplots ] and [ jetplots ] ) . 5 .   the main challenges to the backflow model are the requirement for high ellipticity and subsonic wing growth . adding additional physics is not obviously helpful .",
    "the backflow model seems to require an additional mechanism to make proto - wings which the backflow reinforces ; in our models , we make these channels by the initial expansion of an overpressured cocoon in an anisotropic environment , but this can not explain every xrg .",
    "we can not form new channels solely by deflecting back - flows .",
    "if the backflow model can overcome the issues noted above , it is a very strong candidate for explaining x - shaped and other disturbed radio galaxies .",
    "our models naturally reproduce many of the characteristics of the xrg population ( table  [ predictions ] ) .",
    "there are several natural extensions of this work which promise to be fruitful .",
    "first , adding magnetic fields and investigating other potential collimating mechanisms may rule out or boost the backflow model depending on the wing expansion speeds attained .",
    "second , our models rely on the formation of channels misaligned with the jets ; these have been proposed in several other contexts as well to explain radio galaxy morphology .",
    "the origin of these channels is not known , and identifying and testing candidates would be important for wing formation models .",
    "third , more realistic jets could determine whether the backflow model can support both long wings and active fr  ii lobes with hot spots ; the bending of the jets in particular is an important issue .",
    "finally , models which produce the wings hydrodynamically but not explicitly by the deflection of backflow ( e.g. the recently proposed stellar shell model * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are worth exploring by making the atmospheres more complex in tandem with more realistic jets .                                                                                    , s.  s. , & falle , s.  a.  e.  g. 1996 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . 100 , energy transport in radio galaxies and quasars , ed .",
