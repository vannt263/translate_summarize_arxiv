    "high contrast imaging has recently yielded the first direct images of young extrasolar planets @xcite and a number of other substellar companions @xcite , largely at separations @xmath150 au .",
    "only a handful of substellar or planetary mass companions have been found at separations @xmath420 au , including the recently confirmed planet imaged around @xmath5 pic @xcite and a few substellar companions around older ( @xmath6gyr ) stars ( e.g. , hr  7672  b [ @xcite ] ; scr  1845 - 6357ab [ @xcite ] ) .    the near - infrared coronagraphic imager ( nici ) at the 8.1-m gemini - south telescope @xcite is a dedicated ao instrument tailored expressly for direct imaging of brown dwarf and exoplanet companions .",
    "nici combines several techniques to attenuate starlight and suppress speckles for direct detection of faint companions to bright stars : ( 1 )  lyot coronagraphy , ( 2 )  dual - channel imaging for spectral differential imaging ( sdi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and ( 3 )  operation in a fixed cassegrain rotator mode for angular differential imaging ( adi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these techniques have been used individually in large planet - finding surveys @xcite , the nici campaign is the first time adi and sdi have been employed simultaneously in a large survey .    since december 2008",
    ", the nici planet - finding campaign @xcite has been obtaining deep , high - contrast adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging of a carefully selected sample of @xmath7300 young , nearby stars .",
    "we report the discovery of a close substellar companion to pz tel , a young solar analog ( k0 spectral type ) and a member of the @xmath712 myr  pic  moving group @xcite with a hipparcos distance of 51.5@xmath02.6 pc @xcite .",
    "the nici campaign uses specialized observing strategies to exploit the unique capabilities of the nici instrument . while sdi provides significant contrast gains even for non - methanated objects at separations down to 0.7  , at @xmath70.3  pz",
    "tel b is significantly self - subtracted in our sdi data reductions .",
    "thus , in this letter we focus solely on adi - based techniques . for adi ,",
    "the image rotator is turned off , and the field is allowed to rotate with the parallactic angle on the sky .",
    "the image of a true companion will rotate with the parallactic angle , while speckles will stay fixed relative to the detector .",
    "a psf for the primary star can be built and subtracted from each frame to remove the speckle pattern .",
    "we obtained adi and sdi observations of pz  tel on 11  april  2009  ( ut ) and 9  may  2010  ( ut ) .",
    "these observations were conducted using a flat - topped gaussian profile focal plane mask with hwhm=0.32  ( referred to hereafter as the 0.32mask ) , the ch@xmath8 4@xmath9 short filter ( @xmath10 = 1.578  @xmath3 m ) in the blue channel , and the ch@xmath8 4@xmath9 long filter ( @xmath10 = 1.652  @xmath3 m ) in the red channel . at each epoch , we acquired 45 1-minute frames in a combined adi + sdi mode , over 16.7@xmath11 of field rotation in epoch 1 and 23.2@xmath11 in epoch 2 .",
    "data for each camera were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and distortion - corrected .",
    "sky background was negligible compared to halo brightness at the companion location and has not been removed .",
    "the focal plane mask is not completely opaque at its center , leaving an attenuated , unsaturated image of the primary star ( henceforth `` starspot '' ) which we use for image registration .",
    "images from both channels were registered to the first blue channel image according to starspot centroid positions . to increase our sensitivity to non - methanated companions",
    ", we performed a `` broadband adi - only '' reduction by combining red and blue channel images instead of subtracting them .",
    "the median combination of all the images was subtracted from each individual image to remove the light from the primary star .",
    "individual images were then rotated and stacked .",
    "nici coronagraphic observations using the narrower flat - topped gaussian focal plane mask with hwhm=0.22  ( hereafter 0.22  mask ) were acquired in dual - channel mode at @xmath12-band and -band on 9  may  2010  ut and in single channel mode at @xmath13-band on 10  may  2010  ut . the nici filters are on the mauna kea observatories photometric system @xcite .",
    "we acquired 10 60-s frames in each filter with the rotator on .",
    "frames were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and stacked according to starspot centroid position . the dc level calculated in an annulus far from the object",
    "was subtracted to remove sky background .",
    "@xmath14-band images are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the 0.22  mask has an appproximately gaussian transmission profile , an inner flat plateau of 0.12  radius , and an outer cutoff of 0.4  radius . with its separation of @xmath70.3 , pz  tel  b",
    "is lightly attenuated by the mask .",
    "thus we must determine the mask transmission at both the center and at the companion s position in order to measure the companion s flux ratio relative to the primary . to measure the transmission as a function of radius",
    ", we acquired @xmath14-band images of a 2mass - selected 4.4  binary star .",
    "for each filter , the primary component was scanned across the mask along the same angular trajectory as pz tel b. scans were begun with the primary under the starspot in order to accurately determine the mask center position .",
    "images were taken at 0.02steps out to 0.5 .",
    "integration times were chosen to keep both components unsaturated .",
    "we measured the flux ratio of the primary to the secondary as a function of the primary star displacement from the mask center using photometric apertures of 1 to 3 pixels in radius .",
    "for each photometry aperture , we fit a polynomial power - law to the mask transmission as a function of radius assuming a perfectly transparent mask beyond 0.43  radius .",
    "we used this fit to correct the measured flux ratio of pz  tel  b. at a separation of 0.33 , we estimate an error in our calibration of the mask transmission of 6% , 3% , and 11% in _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k@xmath15 _ respectively",
    ". these mask calibration errors are included in the final photometry errors .",
    "to acquire photometry and astrometry without attenuation due to the focal plane mask , we acquired 43 maskless narrow - band adi images on 10 may 2010 ut .",
    "each image had an integration time of 30.4  s , and the field rotated by 25.7@xmath11 over the entire observation . the narrow - band ch@xmath8 1@xmath9 short filter ( @xmath10 = 1.587  @xmath3 m )",
    "was used in the red channel and the h@xmath16 2 - 1 narrow - band filter ( @xmath10 = 2.1239  @xmath3 m , width of 1.23@xmath9 ) was used in the blue channel .",
    "data from each filter were reduced in separate adi reductions (   2.1 ) .    to correct losses due to self - subtraction from adi ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and to determine the photometric and astrometric uncertainties , we inserted simulated objects into each individual frame by scaling a cutout of the stellar peak and shifting it into position .",
    "objects were simulated at a separation of 0.36 , at position angles of 0 , 180 , and 270@xmath11 ( counterclockwise from north ) , and with @xmath17mag = 4.65.8 in steps of 0.1  mag .",
    "objects were retrieved using apertures of 13 pixels in radius to determine self - subtraction as a function of magnitude .",
    "astrometric measurements are presented in table  [ tab : photom ] .",
    "first - epoch astrometry was measured from the companion centroid position relative to the starspot under the 0.3  mask in the `` broadband adi - only '' reduction .",
    "the companion and starspot positions were measured in each frame , with the companion detected at s / n @xmath1 10 per frame . because the companion falls on a slightly different part of the 0.3  mask in each image , angular asymmetries in the mask transmission",
    "can cause systematic astrometric trends of up to one pixel .",
    "thus , we adopt conservative errors on our first - epoch astrometry based on the amplitudes of these trends . during acceptance testing ,",
    "the nici platescale was measured at 18 mas / pixel .    for the second - epoch astrometry",
    ", we used the maskless adi narrow - band dataset , measuring the centroid position of the companion relative to the unsaturated stellar peak in the final stacked image .",
    "the error was estimated from the astrometric rms scatter of the 3  simulated objects (   2.3 ) with @xmath17mag that best matched the observed object flux .",
    "astrometric measurements from the 0.22mask broadband and the 0.3  mask asdi datasets yielded similar results .",

    "if the object detected by nici was moving with respect to pz  tel  a as a background object , it should have had a separation of @xmath10.5  in 2003 and would have been detected at @xmath115@xmath18 in the vlt data . by scaling and adding a psf star image ( from an unsaturated november 2003 naco dataset of gl  86 ) to the naco data",
    ", we estimate that pz  tel  b had a separation of @xmath40.17  in 2003 .",

    "<S> the companion was detected at a projected separation of 16.4@xmath01.0 au ( 0.33@xmath00.01  ) in april 2009 . </S>",
    "<S> second - epoch observations in may 2010 demonstrate that the companion is physically associated and shows significant orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo modeling constrains the orbit of pz tel b to eccentricities @xmath10.6 . </S>",
    "<S> the near - ir colors of pz  tel  b indicate a spectral type of m7@xmath02 and thus this object will be a new benchmark companion for studies of ultracool , low - gravity photospheres . adopting an age of 12@xmath2  myr for the system , we estimate a mass of 36@xmath06  based on the lyon / dusty evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> pz  tel  b is one of few young substellar companions directly imaged at orbital separations similar to those of giant planets in our own solar system . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the primary star pz  tel  a shows a 70 @xmath3 m emission excess , evidence for a significant quantity of circumstellar dust that has not been disrupted by the orbital motion of the companion . </S>"
