    "containing typically half the mass of ionized hydrogen in galaxies , the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) is visible as an extended h@xmath0 emitting layer in our galaxy ( e.g. the wham ",

    "wood & mathis  @xcite noted that the line ratios increase with distance from the midplane due to the progressive hardening of the radiation .",

    "@xcite , and miller & veilleux @xcite gave evidence that an additional heating source is needed in order to explain the rise of the line ratios with increasing distance @xmath4 from the midplane .",
    "we are constructing photoionization models in order to examine the trends in the observed line ratios and if photoionization can heat up the gas sufficiently in order to explain the data .",
    "we introduce specific extra heating terms , extra means in addition to photoionization , and discuss their properties . in the following section [ data_perseus ] we introduce the observations of the perseus arm to which our models are compared .",

    "@xcite ) survey which were kindly provided by ron reynolds and matt haffner .",
    "survey mapped the northern sky in h@xmath0 with declinations of @xmath5 .",
    "the perseus arm ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) was additionally mapped in [ nii]@xmath86583 and [ sii]@xmath86716 . at each pointing an averaged spectrum with a beam of @xmath9",
    "is measured with a velocity resolution of 12 km @xmath10 .",
    "the emission of the perseus arm can be separated in velocity space from the local emission ( haffner99 ) for galactic longitudes @xmath11 .",
    "this was performed by integrating the line emission in the velocity range @xmath12 km @xmath13 km @xmath10 , no line fitting was performed .",
    "we are using the intensity of the h@xmath0 line as well as the line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 .",
    "the sensitivity limit of 0.1 rayleighs photons @xmath14 @xmath10 @xmath15 results in an observed vertical height of up to @xmath16 = 2 kpc assuming a distance to the arm of 2.5 kpc .",
    "we use the spectral simulation code cloudy , version 96.00 ( described by ferland @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to model the dig .",
    "cloudy determines the physical conditions by balancing the heating and cooling rates , so that the energy is conserved .",
    "the results of the models are compared to the observed emission line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 , and the gas temperature as derived from [ nii]/h@xmath0 .    in order to realize a model describing the dig certain parameters have to be specified :",
    "the ionizing spectrum of the source is a composition of three different stellar temperature : 56% from t = 35000 k , 12% from t = 40000 k , and 32% from t = 45000 k , as used in mathis @xcite and wood et al . @xcite .",
    "the wmbasic models ( pauldrach et al .",
    "@xcite ) , which include n  lte effects , x  ray emission from shocks within stellar winds , are used as the ionizing spectra .",
    "the luminosity of the source is chosen in such a way that the observed run of the h@xmath0 intensity is matched , as shown in figure  [ ha - perseusarm ] .",
    "the density structure is exponential , as derived from the observed h@xmath0 intensity , with a scale height of 1 kpc and a midplane density of 0.2 @xmath17 .",
    "the density is in clumps with a filling factor of 20% , i.e. only 1/5 of the volume is filled with this plasma .",
    "the geometry of the ionized gas is chosen to be a plane parallel layer , i.e. the ratio of the depth of the cloud to the distance of the illuminated face to the ionizing source is smaller than 1/10 .",
    "we are matching the observed h@xmath0 intensity of the observations ( figure  [ ha - perseusarm ] ) by placing the illuminated face of the cloud at a z  height of 1 scale height of the lockman  layer ( 300pc ) assuming a density law of @xmath18 as in miller & cox  @xcite .",
    "this is done after the model is calculated as otherwise the condition of plane parallel illumination of the cloud can not be fulfilled .",
    "the information of the actual position of the ionizing stars are effectively removed , consistent with the picture of having the dig being ionized by radiation leaking out of the lockman ",
    "the intensity gradient of h@xmath0 is matched as well as the estimate of the hydrogen ionizing photon flux by reynolds  @xcite ) : @xmath19 hydrogen ionizing photons @xmath20 . in order to compare the models on a common basis , which is important as extra heating is dominating for large z ",
    "heights , we choose to let the ionization structure be the same for all models ( see figure  [ ionfrac ] ) .",
    "this is in accordance with the idea that the extra heating affects only the temperature of the gas .",
    "the forbidden levels of nitrogen and sulphur can then be more easily excited by collisions with the electrons which in turn elevates the line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 . figure  [ ha - perseusarm ] shows that the intensity gradient of h@xmath0 varies only a little for the different models .",
    "the scale heights for the models are slightly different ( @xmath21 10% ) for the models with an extra heating , which can be explained by assuming that the dig ",
    "layer is in pressure equilibrium .",
    "this effect was also noted by wood & mathis  @xcite .",
    "the ionization parameters ( u ) of all models lie in the narrow range between log(u ) = -3.0 and -3.1 .",
    "the ism composition of cloudy is used with n / h and s / h set to the values in haffner99 ( n / h = @xmath22 , s / h = @xmath23 ) .",
    "graphite and silicate grains with the size distribution used for the ism ( see hazy , ferland  @xcite ) are present in the gas and account for less than 10 % of the global heating .",
    "the inclusion of pahs give only variations @xmath24",
    "3% for the line ratios and have only a small effect on the heating balance .",
    "the interaction with cosmic rays is taken into account as described in ferland & mushotsky  @xcite . +",
    "a crucial factor is the consideration of the line of sight .",
    "the observations give information about the line ratios at different positions orthogonal to the source of the ionizing radiation .",
    "the correct local line ratios are represented by the ratios of the volume emission coefficients @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "an important issue is the treatment of the line of sight to the perseus arm due to our position in the milky way as shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry - perseusarm ] .",
    "each pointing of the wham survey contains contributions from different @xmath16 heights above the midplane ( @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) , this effect is taken into account by integrating over the particular sight line in the models .",
    "the distance to the perseus arm is assumed to be 2.5 kpc and the thickness of the arm to be 1 kpc as quoted in haffner99 . moreover , the observations are the average of a beam size of @xmath9 which means that we have to take into account an additional integration over different z heights , on average 45 pc .",
    "these effects of geometry and observational smearing are taken into consideration here for the first time .",
    "fig  [ geometry - beam_smearing ] shows the effect of the beam smearing and line of sight geometry on the calculated line ratios for z  heights up to 2.5 kpc , which have to be considered for the observed heights of 1.8 kpc .",
    "these effect increase the corrected line ratios by at most 15% and their trend is altered for high z  heights .",
    "the corrected model without an extra heating seems to suggest that [ nii]/h@xmath0 is not increasing after about 1.6 kpc , but the uncorrected model shows a further increase due to the hardening of the radiation .",
    "the result of the gas temperature ( section  [ comp ] , fig .",
    "[ gastemp ] ) is even more influenced by this issue .",
    "the discussion of the line ratios therefore need to include an appropriate treatment of the line of sight geometry and the beam smearing to take these effects into account .",
    "additional heating to photoionization is included which is proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath1 in accordance with reynolds et al .",
    "@xcite , their factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "we choose rates in the same range as in their paper : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the heating  cooling balance can then be written as either @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the heating due to photoionization is given by @xmath35 and the cooling by @xmath36 .",
    "the inclusion of an extra heating source rises the gas temperature of the models , at the same time the ionization structure varies only slightly .",
    "the temperature of the cloudy models are calculated by heating  cooling balance .",
    "the extra heating therefore increases the temperature , having more pronounced effects at larger z heights as the photoionization heating rate decreases like @xmath37 as shown in fig .  [ gastemp ] .",
    "the graph is explained in more detail in the next section .    in our models the ionization structure",
    "is nearly unaffected by the inclusion of an extra heating source , sulphur is slightly more effected than nitrogen .",
    "this behavior is the basic assumption for the extra heating in reynolds et al .",
    "however they are assuming a constant ratio of @xmath38 , whereas the models show a dependence on z height , this is expected as the radiation gets progressively absorbed .",
    "figure  [ ionfrac ] shows ionization structure and the change dependent on the different heating rates .",
    "hydrogen is nearly fully ionized throughout all models which is a basic characteristic of the dig .      in fig .",
    "[ n - h - z - perseusarm ] and fig .",
    "[ sii - nii - perseusarm ] the models differ by the type of extra heating , ranging between models without extra heating and a rate of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "there was no fitting done in order to match the models with the observations .",
    "no best  fit exists and",
    "therefore the models are independent of the observational quality , individual spectral features , or small scale variations which can not be reproduced with a smooth density distribution .",
    "as the data for small @xmath16 heights are contaminated with radiation from the midplane and dust absorption it is convenient to consider line ratios for @xmath16heights above 0.8 kpc to be pure dig .",
    "this is also the range for which the h@xmath0 scale height was determined .",
    "the models show lower values of [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 for the lower z heights as doubly ionized nitrogen contributes 35% and doubly ionized sulphur even 80% , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ionfrac ] . as a consequence",
    "[ nii ] and [ sii ] are weaker .",
    "figure  [ n - h - z - perseusarm ] shows the development of the line ratios with @xmath16 height , both the data and the models show an increase with @xmath16 .",
    "the trend in the line ratios is matched by the models even without an extra heating source .",
    "the [ nii]/h@xmath0 line ratio above 1 kpc can be explained with the models including an extra heating rate .",
    "the modeled [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio is up to a factor of two below the observations , however the theoretical uncertainty for the [ sii ] line is very high as dielectronic recombination is an important process in the dig . as the corresponding recombination coefficients are not known ( see discussion in ferland et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the results of the models have to be handled with care .",
    "our models use the kludge approximation ( ferland  @xcite ) .",
    "models without dielectronic recombination have [ sii]/h@xmath0 decreased by 50% . if the rate is doubled then [ sii]/h@xmath0",
    "is increased by 50% .",
    "figure  [ gastemp ] shows the gas temperature of the models , the increase of the line ratios with z height is due to the progressive hardening of the radiation as the photons go through the gas layer . in order to explain the observed line ratios an extra heating source is however needed which does not alter the general shape of the predicted line ratios but elevates the line ratios . as [ nii ] and [ sii ] are forbidden lines which get collisional excited by electrons , an increase in gas temperature increases the amount of electrons capable to excite the singly ionized nitrogen and sulphur ions which can then decay by emitting the emission lines in questions",
    "the gas temperature is deducted from the observations through the relation - following reynolds et al .",

    "\\ , t_4^{0.39 } \\exp(-2.18/t_4)$ ] , @xmath41 .",
    "we are not using the collision strength of singly ionized nitrogen from reynolds et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath42 , aller  @xcite , but the data from stafford et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to the different coefficients and temperatures on average 250 k below the values of reynolds et al .",
    "for singly ionized sulfur we use the data from lanzafame et al .",
    "@xcite instead of aller  @xcite as in reynolds et al .",
    "the plot also shows the impact of the line of sight geometry and beam smearing as well as the consideration of the ionization structure of the models . as the line of sight leads to higher [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios ( up to 15% , ) this effects , when accounted for , lower temperatures . the ionization structure , i.e. @xmath44 is only valid for z @xmath3 800 pc , leads to higher estimates of the temperature .",
    "the combined effect is the elevation of the derived temperature for z @xmath24 800 pc and above that lower values by about 200 k. the models without an extra heating source have temperatures too low , an extra heating source independent of density shows very good agreement with the observed temperatures .",
    "the extra heating @xmath45 seems to best fit the data up to 800 pc , then the extra heating @xmath46 gives the best agreement for higher z values .",
    "the interpretation for the z heights @xmath24 800 pc have to be handled with care as this region is contaminated by radiation from the midplane and therefore the part responsible for the dig emission is difficult to estimate .",
    "magnetic reconnection ( e.g. birk et al .",
    "@xcite ) or heating by cosmic rays through linear landau  damping ( lerche & schlickeiser  @xcite ) are possible processes producing a heating independent of density . as photoelectric",
    "heating from dust grains is @xmath45 , the data suggest that there is more dust present at z  heights below 800 pc than present in the models if this mechanism is responsible for the elevated temperature .    in fig .",
    "[ sii - nii - perseusarm ] the line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 are plotted against each other .",
    "values of [ nii]/h@xmath0 greater than 1 , which can not be explained by classical hii  region calculations , are reached with models using an extra heating source .",
    "also in this case the extra heating independent of density is able to produce higher [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratios than the other therefore matching better with the data .",
    "the limits of haffner99 for two constant @xmath47 ratios ( 0.5 and 0.25 ) are also given .",
    "the ionization fractions of the models ( see fig .",
    "[ ionfrac ] ) are within these two limits for z @xmath3 0.6@xmath48kpc . together with the temperature plot ( fig .",
    "[ gastemp ] ) the models match in all these direct and derived quantities with the data and agrees with the estimates of haffner99 and reynolds et al .",
    "the application to other galaxies shows that this diagram is also a valuable diagnostic for the chemical evolution ( elwert et al .",
    "we have shown that the observed trend of the line ratios [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 above the galactic plane can successfully be explained by photoionization models including extra heating and considering the line of sight geometry .",
    "the observed values need an extra heating source which strength lies at the lower end of the predicted values of reynolds et al .",
    "@xcite due to our models . at high z heights ( z @xmath3 800 pc ) an extra heating independent of density gives the best agreement with the data , whereas for smaller z heights an extra heating term @xmath45 gives better results concerning the temperature .",
    "there is an intrinsically increase in the line rations and the gas temperature due to the progressive hardening of the radiation .",
    "the extra heating terms are enhancing this trend and elevate the line ratios to the observed values .",
    "it is important to incorporate the observing geometry to the perseus arm into the models when comparing with the data . a discussion concerning models of observed line ratios in edge  on galaxies is given in elwert  @xcite and elwert & dettmar  @xcite .",
