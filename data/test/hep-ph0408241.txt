    "the standard big bang theory predicts the existence of @xmath1 neutrinos per flavour in the visible universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this is an enormous abundance unrivalled by any other known form of matter , falling second only to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photon . yet , unlike the cmb photon which boasts its first ( serendipitous ) detection in the 1960s and which has since been observed and its properties measured to a high degree of accuracy in a series of airborne / satellite and ground based experiments , the relic neutrino continues to be elusive in the laboratory .",
    "the chief reason for this is of course the feebleness of the weak interaction .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino mass also makes momentum - transfer - based detection methods highly impractical . at present",
    ", the only evidence for the relic neutrino comes from inferences from other cosmological measurements , such as big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cmb together with large scale structure ( lss ) data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is difficult to accept that these neutrinos will never be detected in a more direct way .    in order to design possible direct , scattering - based detection methods ,",
    "a precise knowledge of the phase space distribution of relic neutrinos is indispensable . in this connection",
    ", it is important to note that an oscillation interpretation of the atmospheric and solar neutrino data ( e.g. , @xcite ) implies that at least two of the neutrino mass eigenstates are nonrelativistic today .",
    "these neutrinos are subject to gravitational clustering on existing cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryonic structures , possibly causing the local neutrino number density to depart from the standard value of @xmath2 , and the momentum distribution to deviate from the relativistic fermi  dirac function .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a method that will allow us to predict the phase space distribution of relic neutrinos in our local neighbourhood at earth ( @xmath3 from the galactic centre ) , as well as in outer space .",
    "the method systematically takes into account gravitational clustering of relic neutrinos on scales below @xmath4 , and can be applied to the complete range of experimentally and observationally consistent neutrino masses . with these predictions ,",
    "we determine the precise implications of relic neutrino clustering for future direct search experiments . to this end",
    ", we note that in earlier studies of relic neutrino direct detection , the neutrino number density in our local neighbourhood is either assumed to be unrealistically large , or simply left as a free parameter ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with the emergence of the concordance flat @xmath0cdm model as the cosmological model of choice ,",
    "today we are in a position to compute the relic neutrino phase space distribution within a well defined cosmological framework , and to contemplate again the prospects for their direct detection in a definitive way .",
    "our studies here will also be useful for such investigations as relic neutrino absorption  @xcite and emission  @xcite spectroscopy .",
    "the standard procedure for any gravitational clustering investigation is to solve the @xmath5-dimensional vlasov , or collisionless boltzmann , equation using @xmath6-body techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these techniques are computationally very expensive and necessarily come with limited resolutions . in the context of the cold+hot dark matter ( chdm )",
    "model , earlier @xmath6-body studies involving neutrinos probe their kinematic effects on structure formation from cluster and galaxy abundances on large scales ( e.g. , ) , to halo properties on small scales @xcite . while the chdm model has fallen out of favour in recent years ( see , however , @xcite )",
    ", it is instructive to note that the halo simulation of @xcite has a formal resolution of only @xmath7 .",
    "this is clearly inadequate for our considerations , where the scale of interest is of order @xmath8 .    in the context of the flat @xmath0cdm model ,",
    "singh and ma ( hereafter , sm ) presented a novel approximate method to probe the accretion of neutrinos onto cdm halos at scales below @xmath9 .",
    "the salient feature of this study is their use of parametric halo density profiles from high resolution , pure @xmath0cdm simulations as an external input , while the neutrino component is treated as a small perturbation whose clustering depends on the cdm halo profile , but is too small to affect it in return .",
    "implementation of this approximation requires the neutrino mass density @xmath10 to be much smaller than its cdm counterpart @xmath11 . on cosmological scales , we know now from lss data that the ratio @xmath12 is at most @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "on cluster / galactic scales , neutrino free - streaming ensures that @xmath14 always remains smaller than its cosmological counterpart @xcite .",
    "thus the approximation scheme , so far , is sound .",
    "furthermore , in order to track the neutrino density fluctuations in the most effortless way , sm employed the linearised vlasov equation instead of its full version .",
    "unfortunately , linear methods are known to break down when the density fluctuations reach the order of unity . indeed , in their two trial runs with chdm parameters , the linear results of sm compare favourably with @xmath6-body results of @xcite in the outer part of the halo , where the neutrino overdensity is relatively low .",
    "the denser inner parts ( @xmath15 ) , however , show marked disagreement .",
    "this discrepancy renders sm s claim that their complete prescription is able to probe neutrino clustering on sub - galactic scales doubtful .    in the present investigation",
    ", we adopt one of the more attractive features of sm s study , namely , the use of parametric halo profiles as an external input .",
    "however , we improve upon their analysis by solving the vlasov equation in its ( almost ) full glory utilising a restricted , @xmath6-@xmath16-body ( pronounced : en - one - body ) method based on the following observation : in the limit @xmath17 and the cdm contribution dominates the total gravitational potential , not only will the cdm halo be gravitationally blind to the neutrinos , the neutrinos themselves will also have negligible gravitational interaction with each other .",
    "this allows us to track them one particle at a time in @xmath6 independent simulations , instead of following @xmath6 particles simultaneously in one single run , as in a conventional @xmath6-body study .",
    "an obvious advantage of our @xmath6-@xmath16-body technique is that it requires virtually no computing power when compared with a full scale @xmath6-body simulation with the same , large @xmath6 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is also less time - consuming since we have done away with the need for a gravity solver ( the core of all @xmath6-body techniques ) .",
    "in addition , restricted methods such as ours do not suffer from spurious two body relaxation , and hence do not require the introduction of an artificial softening length that is mandatory in conventional @xmath6-body studies .",
    "lastly , we note that restricted methods have been used extensively in the studies of galaxy interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and , when properly motivated , should not be seen as inferior to full scale @xmath6-body techniques .    as a closing remark ,",
    "let us stress again that our purpose here is not to investigate the effects of neutrino mass on cosmology , but rather to address some simple questions such as how many relic neutrinos can we realistically expect to find in this very space we occupy , what kind of energies do they have , where in the universe can we expect to find the highest concentration of relic neutrinos , etc .",
    ", given what we know today about cosmology . in this regard ,",
    "the analysis we present here is most exhaustive .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ cosm ] with an assessment of the current observational constraints on the relic neutrino background . in section  [ vlasov ] ,",
    "we introduce the vlasov equation which is used to track the phase space distribution of the neutrinos .",
    "section  [ profiles ] contains a brief discussion of the halo density profiles to be employed in our calculations . in section  [ onebody ]",
    ", we solve the vlasov equation for the halo models using our improved @xmath6-@xmath16-body method for a variety of halo and neutrino masses . in section",
    "[ linear ] , we compute for the same halo models and neutrino masses the neutrino overdensities using the linear method of sm and examine its validity . section  [ milkyway ] deals exclusively with relic neutrinos in the milky way , and in particular their phase space distribution in our immediate vicinity .",
    "we discuss in section  [ detection ] the implications of our findings for scattering - based detection methods , and we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "taking as our basis ( i ) the flat @xmath0cdm model with @xmath19 and hubble parameter @xmath20 , ( ii ) neutrino mass splittings inferred from the solar and atmospheric data , @xmath21 , and ( iii ) the invisible @xmath22 decay width from lep which constrains the number of @xmath23 doublet neutrinos to three @xcite , a minimal theory of neutrino clustering is fixed only by the absolute masses of the neutrinos @xmath24 . the current laboratory limit from tritium",
    "@xmath25 decay experiments is @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) @xcite , and should improve to @xmath28 with the upcoming katrin experiment @xcite .",
    "cosmology also provides a constraint on @xmath24 . for three degenerate species , an upper bound of @xmath29 ( @xmath27",
    ") @xcite has been inferred from a combined analysis of the cmb anisotropy from wmap @xcite and galaxy clustering from sdss ( sdss - gal ) @xcite ( or from 2dfgrs @xcite ) , together with an hst prior on the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "( reference @xcite uses also snia @xcite ) .. ] adding to the fit galaxy bias @xcite and ly@xmath30 forest analyses can tighten the constraint to @xmath31 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , although the robustness of these additional inputs is still contentious .",
    "weak lensing of galaxies @xcite or of the cmb @xcite will provide an alternative probe for the cosmological implications of massive neutrinos .",
    "while constraints from cosmology are interesting in their own right , they are also highly model dependent , and degeneracies abound . for instance",
    ", if tensors and running of the scalar spectral index are allowed , the last @xmath32 bound relaxes to @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "another possibility is an interplay between @xmath24 and @xmath34 , where @xmath34 is the _ effective _ number of thermalised fermionic degrees of freedom present in the radiation - dominated era , such that increasing @xmath34 actually weakens the bound on @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for example , a @xmath35 model receives a cmb+lss+priors constraint of ( i ) @xmath36 , if all six particles are equally massive , ( ii ) @xmath37 , if three are massive and the others exactly massless , and ( iii ) @xmath38 , if only one is massive .",
    "currently , @xmath39 is allowed by cmb+lss+priors @xcite .",
    "future cmb experiments such as planck will be sensitive to @xmath40 @xcite",
    "lastly , we note that bbn prefers @xmath41 ( @xmath27 ) , in the absence of a @xmath42 chemical potential @xmath43 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . allowing for a nonzero @xmath43",
    "weakens the bounds to @xmath44 for @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "there is no lack of candidates in the literature for these extra @xmath46 degrees of freedom .",
    "we shall not list them here .",
    "what is certain , however , is that they can not take the form of very large chemical potentials in the @xmath47 sectors , since large neutrino mixing inferred from oscillation experiments ensures that @xmath48 , too small to be a significant source of @xmath34 @xcite .    in the present analysis",
    ", we assume the neutrinos to constitute exactly three thermalised fermionic degrees of freedom , and adopt a conservative mass bound of @xmath49 corresponding to the @xmath50 constraint from the wmap+sdss galaxy cluster analysis @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ( [ eq : massbound ] ) may be interpreted as a restrictive bound for models with extra , non - neutrino relativistic particles ( @xmath51 ) , or with a significant running spectral index , as discussed earlier .",
    "a system consisting of several types of weakly interacting , self - gravitating particles [ e.g. , cdm plus neutrinos ] may be modelled as a multi - component collisionless gas whose phase space distributions @xmath52 obey the vlasov equation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath53 the single - particle phase density @xmath54 is defined so that @xmath55 is the number of @xmath56 particles in an infinitesimal phase space volume element .",
    "the variables @xmath57 are the comoving distance , its associated conjugate momentum , and the conformal time respectively , with @xmath58 as the scale factor and @xmath59 the mass of the @xmath56th particle species .",
    "all temporal and spatial derivatives are taken with respect to comoving coordinates , i.e. , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in the nonrelativistic , newtonian limit , equation (",
    "[ eq : vlasov ] ) is equivalent to @xmath62 with the poisson equation @xmath63 @xmath64 relating the peculiar gravitational potential @xmath65 to the density fluctuations @xmath66 with respect to the physical mean @xmath67 .",
    "the vlasov equation expresses conservation of phase space density @xmath68 along each characteristic @xmath69 given by @xmath70 the complete set of characteristics coming through every point in phase space is thus exactly equivalent to equation ( [ eq : vlasov ] ) .",
    "it is generally not possible to follow the whole set of characteristics , but the evolution of the system can still be traced , to some extent , if we follow a sufficiently large but still manageable sample selected from the initial phase space distribution .",
    "this forms the basis of particle - based solution methods .",
    "a `` first principles '' approach to neutrino clustering requires the simultaneous solution of the vlasov equation ( [ eq : vlasov ] ) [ or , equivalently , the equations for the characteristics ( [ eq : characteristic ] ) ] for both the cdm and the neutrino components . in our treatment , however , we assume only the cdm component @xmath11 contributes to @xmath71 in the poisson equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) , and @xmath11 to be completely specified by halo density profiles from high resolution @xmath0cdm simulations .",
    "we provide in this section further justifications for this approach , as well as a brief discussion on the properties of the halo density profiles to be used in our analysis .",
    "it is well known that after they decouple from the cosmic plasma at @xmath72 , light neutrinos ( @xmath73 ) have too much thermal velocity to cluster on small scales via gravitational instability in the early stages of structure formation .",
    "accretion onto cdm protoclusters becomes possible only after the neutrino velocity has dropped below the velocity dispersion of the protoclusters .",
    "the mean velocity of the unperturbed neutrino distribution has a time dependence of @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the redshift .",
    "a typical galaxy cluster has a velocity dispersion of about @xmath76 today ; a typical galaxy , about @xmath77 .",
    "thus , for sub - ev neutrinos , clustering on small scales can only have been a @xmath78 event",
    ".    on the other hand , based on a systematic @xmath6-body study of halo formation in a variety of hierarchical clustering cosmologies , navarro , frenk and white ( hereafter , nfw ) argued in 1996 that density profiles of cdm halos conform to a universal shape , generally independently of the halo mass , the cosmological parameters and the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "this so - called nfw profile has a two - parameter functional form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a characteristic inner radius , and @xmath81 a corresponding inner density .",
    "these parameters @xmath80 and @xmath82 are determined by the halo s virial mass @xmath83 and a dimensionless concentration parameter @xmath84 defined as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the virial radius , within which lies @xmath83 of matter with an average density equal to @xmath87 times the mean matter density @xmath88 at that redshift , i.e. , @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the present day mean matter density .",
    "the factor @xmath87 is usually taken to be the overdensity predicted by the dissipationless spherical top - hat collapse model @xmath91 , which takes on a value of @xmath92 for an einstein  de sitter cosmology , while the currently favoured @xmath0cdm model has @xmath93 at @xmath94 . is taken to be the radius @xmath95 , within which the average density is @xmath96 times the _ critical density _ of the universe , irrespective of the cosmological model in hand . ]    within this framework , any halo density profile is completely specified by its virial mass and concentration via equations ( [ eq : nfw ] ) to ( [ eq : mvir ] ) .",
    "indeed , the nfw profile in its two - parameter form generally gives , for quiet isolated halos , a fit accurate to @xmath97 in the range of radii @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , nfw argued for a tight correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , such that the mass distribution within a halo is effectively fixed by the halo s virial mass alone .",
    "later studies support , to some extent , this conclusion ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; halo concentration correlates with its mass , albeit with a significant scatter .",
    "the analysis of @xcite of @xmath99 halos in the mass range @xmath100 reveals a trend ( at @xmath94 ) described by @xmath101 with a @xmath102 spread about the median of @xmath103 for fixed @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , for a fixed virial mass , the median concentration parameter exhibits a redshift dependence of @xmath104 between @xmath94 and @xmath105 .    in their analysis ,",
    "sm interpreted the set of equations ( [ eq : nfw ] ) to ( [ eq : cz ] ) as a complete description of an individual halo s evolution in time . while we do not completely disagree with this interpretation",
    ", it should be remembered that the relations ( [ eq : cmvir ] ) and ( [ eq : cz ] ) refer only to the behaviour of the statistical mean for _ fixed _ virial masses , and do not actually describe how individual halos accrete mass over time .",
    "a better motivation for the equations use comes from the observation that the physical densities of the inner regions of individual isolated halos tend to remain very stable over time ( @xmath106 ) @xcite .",
    "this behaviour , as it turns out , can be more or less reproduced by equations ( [ eq : nfw ] ) to ( [ eq : cz ] ) , if we interpret @xmath83 as the halo s virial mass today .",
    "merging subhalos tend to affect the main halo s density profile only in its outer region .",
    "therefore , provided that neutrino clustering becomes important only after @xmath107 and the halos have had no major mergers since then , we are justified to either use these equations here , or simply model the cdm halo as a static object in physical coordinates , as a first approximation .",
    "finally , we note that there exists in the literature a number of other halo profiles ( e.g. , ) , which , in some cases , provide better fits to simulations than does the nfw profile ( [ eq : nfw ] ) .",
    "however , these profiles generally differ from ( [ eq : nfw ] ) by less than @xmath108 @xcite so we do not consider them in our study .",
    "using the nfw halo density profile ( [ eq : nfw ] ) as an input , we find solutions to the vlasov equation in the limit @xmath17 by solving the equations for the characteristics ( [ eq : characteristic ] ) . we discuss below the basic set - up .",
    "technical details can be found in the appendix .",
    "we model the cdm distribution as follows .",
    "we assume that throughout space is a uniform distribution of cdm . on top of it , sits a spherical nfw halo at the origin . in order",
    "that the halo overdensity merges smoothly into the background density , we extend the nfw profile to beyond the virial radius . furthermore , for convenience",
    ", we treat the nfw profile as a perturbation @xmath109 , rather than a physical density .",
    "this simplification should make very little difference to the final results , since the halo density is always much larger than the background density .",
    "the halo s properties and its evolution in time are contained in the set of equations ( [ eq : nfw ] ) to ( [ eq : cz ] ) .",
    "for the factor @xmath87 , we take a time - independent value @xmath110 , following and sm .",
    "we choose this somewhat uncommon definition so as to facilitate direct comparisons between the results of sm and those of the present study .",
    "however , since the choice of @xmath87 affects the profile only through @xmath80 [ see equation ( [ eq : rs ] ) in the appendix ] , we can see immediately that using instead the more common @xmath111 , where @xmath112 with @xmath113 , will make little difference to the outcome .",
    "a more important issue is the role played by other cdm structures ( i.e. , other halos and voids ) that should realistically be in the surroundings . in our present scheme , these have all been lumped into one uniform background so as to preserve the spherical symmetry of the problem . in reality",
    ", these structures will induce tidal forces and distort the symmetry .",
    "however , we expect tidal forces to be important only for clustering in the outer part of the halo where the gravitational potential is low and several halos may compete for the same neutrinos . clustering in the deep potential well of the inner part , on the other hand , should not be seriously affected .    for the neutrinos",
    ", we take the initial distribution to be the homogeneous and isotropic fermi  dirac distribution with no chemical potential , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the present day neutrino temperature . in principle , the chemical potential need not be exactly zero . in fact , a positive chemical potential @xmath116 should improve , to some extent , the clustering of neutrinos ( as opposed to anti - neutrinos ) by providing more low velocity specimens that cluster more efficiently than do their high velocity counterparts . however , this enhancement is necessarily accompanied by a suppression of clustering in the anti - neutrino sector , for which a negative @xmath117 tends to deplete the low velocity states . currently , the upper bound on @xmath116 is @xmath118 , too small to warrant a detailed investigation into a possible `` clustering asymmetry '' .",
    "we simulate initial momentum values in the range @xmath119 , which accounts for more than @xmath120 of the distribution ( [ eq : fermidirac ] ) .",
    "the initial spatial positions of the neutrinos range from @xmath121 , to as far as it takes for the fastest particles to land within a distance of @xmath122 from the halo centre at @xmath94 .",
    "we consider a sample of three neutrino masses , @xmath123 , consistent with the bound ( [ eq : massbound ] ) , and a range of halo viral masses , @xmath124 , corresponding to halos of the galaxy to the galaxy cluster variety .",
    "all simulations model a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology , with the parameters @xmath125    the initial spatial and momentum distribution is divided into small chunks that move under the external potential of the cdm halo , but independently of each other .",
    "a low resolution run is first carried out for each set of @xmath126 .",
    "all chunks that end up at @xmath94 inside a sphere of radius @xmath122 centred on the halo are traced back to their origin , subdivided into smaller chunks , and then re - simulated .",
    "the process is repeated until the inner @xmath127 is resolved .",
    "the initial redshift is taken to be @xmath128 .",
    "this should be sufficient , since clustering is not expected to be fully under way until @xmath107 .",

    "the functional form of equation ( [ eq : asymptoticsolution ] ) already tells us something very interesting ; large fourier modes in the neutrino density fluctuations are suppressed by a factor proportional to @xmath190 relative to their cdm counterparts .",

    "this @xmath137 dependence is reflected , approximately , by both our linear and @xmath6-@xmath16-body results in figure [ fig : overdensities ] , and is particularly pronounced at small radii .",
    "that equation ( [ eq : asymptoticsolution ] ) is a solution of ( [ eq : perturbation ] ) is contingent upon the satisfaction of the condition ( [ eq : asymptoticcondition ] ) , which requires , for a fixed neutrino mass , @xmath193 to be larger than some nominal @xmath194 determined by the rates of change of the scale factor @xmath58 and of the cdm perturbations @xmath195 .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath58 is a simple and well defined function of the cosmological model .",
    "the growth rate of @xmath182 , on the other hand , is usually more complicated .",
    "however , because our halos are practically static in physical coordinates , this rate ( in comoving fourier space ) can only be at most of the order of the universal expansion rate ( which comes in through the conversion factor @xmath58 when we switch the halo profile from physical to comoving coordinates ) .",
    "thus the condition ( [ eq : asymptoticcondition ] ) is roughly equivalent to @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the hubble expansion parameter at time @xmath198 .",

    "the discrepancy is most prominent in the dense , inner regions ( @xmath208 ) , and worsens as we increase ( i ) the neutrino mass @xmath24 , and ( ii ) the halo mass @xmath83 .",
    "the worst case corresponds to when both @xmath24 and @xmath83 are large ; the case of @xmath209 , for example , sees the @xmath6-@xmath16-body and the linear overdensities differ by a factor of about six . for smaller neutrino and halo masses , concordance between the two approaches",
    "improves as we move to larger radii .",
    "indeed , for @xmath210 , complete agreement is seen throughout the region of interest . upon closer inspection",
    ", one finds that the linear theory ceases to be a faithful approximation once the neutrino overdensity reaches a value of about three or four .",
    "this is of course fully consistent with the standard lore that perturbative methods fail once the perturbations exceed unity and nonlinear effects set in .",
    "can the linear approximation be salvaged ?",
    "yes , provided we impose a great deal of smoothing . in the case of @xmath209",
    ", for example , the overdensities computed from the two different approaches can be reconciled with each other if we smooth them both over a scale of roughly @xmath211 .",
    "such a large smoothing length will render the linear method completely useless for the study of neutrino clustering on sub - galactic scales ( unless of course the neutrino mass is so small that the overdensity does not exceed unity by much anyway ) .",

    "finally , we note that the neutrino overdensities in figure 2 of sm are at odds with our linear results in figure [ fig : overdensities ] .",
    "this discrepancy can not be ameliorated by simply supposing that sm have normalised their neutrino densities for _ three _ flavours to the _ one _ flavour average @xmath2 , since this normalisation will render some of their results  specifically , where @xmath212unphysical . only a normalisation to _ three _ flavours can give these results a physical meaning , but at the expense of incompatibility with our figure [ fig : overdensities ] , as well as with sm s own figure 3 .",
    "we therefore conclude that sm s results as presented in their figure 2 are erroneous .",
    "in this section , we consider relic neutrino clustering in the milky way .",
    "we compute explicitly the number of neutrinos and their distribution in momentum space in our local neighbourhood at earth ( @xmath213 from the galactic centre ) .",
    "this information is essential for any direct search experiment .",
    "we perform this calculation using the @xmath6-@xmath16-body method of section  [ onebody ] , but with a few modifications to the external potential .",
    "firstly , we note that the central region of the milky way ( @xmath214 ) is dominated by baryonic matter in the form of a disk , a bulge , and possibly a rapidly rotating bar .",
    "each of these components has its own distinct density profile .",
    "furthermore , in the standard theory of hierarchical galaxy formation , baryons and dark matter are initially well mixed , and collapse together to form halos via gravitational instability .",
    "galactic structures arise when the baryons cool and fall out of the original halo towards the centre . as the baryons condense , their gravitational forces tend to pull the dark matter inward , thereby distorting the inner @xmath215 of the original halo profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of modification to the mass distribution is important for us at @xmath216 .",
    "fortunately for our calculation , gravitating neutrinos do not distinguish between halo and baryons .",
    "therefore , it suffices to use simply the total mass distribution inferred from observational data ( e.g. , rotation curves , satellite kinematics , etc . ) , without any detailed modelling of the individual components .",
    "what is still missing , however , is the redshift dependence of the mass distribution .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to find in the literature any simple parametric form for this dependence .",
    "however , mass modelling of the milky way @xcite suggests that certain observationally acceptable bulge+disk+halo models are indeed consistent with the aforementioned theory of baryonic compression , and can be traced back to halos _ originally _ of the nfw form by supposing that the system has undergone a phase of adiabatic contraction @xcite .",
    "thus , for our investigation , it is probably fair to think of the nfw profile as the initial mass distribution , and the evolution as a smooth transition from this initial distribution to the present day one .    instead of modelling this transition , however , our strategy here is to conduct two series of simulations , one for the present day mass distribution of the milky way ( mwnow ) which we assume to be static , and one for the nfw halo ( nfwhalo ) that would have been there , had baryon compression not taken place .",
    "the real neutrino overdensity should then lie somewhere between these two extremes .    for the nfwhalo run ,",
    "we use the parameters @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "these numbers are taken from the paper of klypin , zhao and somerville ( hereafter , kzs ) @xcite , from their `` favoured '' mass model of the milky way .",

    "however , the concentration parameter @xmath84 should still carry a redshift dependence _",
    " la _ equation ( [ eq : cz ] ) , in order to reproduce the correct time dependence of the density profile .    for mwnow",
    ", we adopt the total mass distribution ( halo+disk+bulge ) presented in figure 3 of kzs , and fit it approximately to a power law from @xmath121 to @xmath219 , @xmath220 where @xmath221 means the total mass contained within a radius @xmath222 .",
    "we assume this fit to hold for the region inside a _ physical _ radius of @xmath219 at all times , i.e. , @xmath223 .",
    "the region outside of this @xmath219 sphere is not affected by baryonic compression according to the kzs mass model ( cf .",
    "their figure 7 ) so we adopt the original nfw density profile outwardly from @xmath219 . thus , schematically , we have @xmath224 where @xmath225 , @xmath226 is the mass contained in an nfw halo at radius @xmath222 [ or @xmath227 in equation ( [ eq : nfwmass ] ) ] , and @xmath228 for the parameters used in this analysis .",

    ", it may seem unphysical that the apparently static mwnow potential ( in _ physical coordinates _ ) should capture so many neutrinos . to resolve this `` paradox '' , one must remember that neutrino clustering is studied in the context of an expanding universe ; the ( unbound ) neutrino thermal velocity decreases with time [ equation ( [ eq : fdspeed ] ) ] , thus causing them to be more readily captured .",
    "equivalently , in _ comoving coordinates _ , it is easy to see that while the neutrino conjugate momentum ( [ eq : comoving ] ) does not redshift , the mwnow potential well shrinks in size and deepens with time .    in each scenario we studied ,",

    "it is interesting to compare our results with nominal bounds from phase space arguments . by demanding the final coarse - grained distribution to be always less than the maximum of the original fine - grained distribution , tremaine and gunn argued in 1979 that if neutrinos alone are to constitute the dark matter of a galactic halo , their mass must be larger than @xmath292 , assuming that the halo has a maxwellian phase space distribution as motivated by the theory of violent relaxation @xcite .",

    "neutrinos with higher momenta that could be hovering around in the vicinity have been completely ignored .",
    "in contrast , in our calculations , it is of no concern to us whether or not the relic neutrinos actually form bound states with the galaxy / halo . therefore it is more appropriate for us to sum every neutrino in sight , rather than imposing a cut - off at @xmath298 .",

    "the heaviest @xmath126 set is short of the bound by at least one order of magnitude .",

    "let us nevertheless dream about the far future , in which an ultimate large hadron collider ( ulhc ) exists and is able to accelerate protons to energies above @xmath409 between the electroweak scale @xmath410 and the scale of grand unification @xmath411 .",
    "the intermediate scale is exploited in many schemes of supersymmetry breaking ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in seesaw mechanisms for neutrino masses @xcite . ] in a ring of ultimate circumference @xmath412 around the earth , thus leading to an interaction rate of more than one event per year ( cf .",
    "table  [ table : accelerators ] ) . even under these most optimistic circumstances , is it possible to reliably detect these interactions ? clearly , elastic scattering of the beam particles with the relic neutrinos  one of the contributions to the rate  ( [ eq : acc_rate])will be next to impossible to detect because of the small momentum transfers involved ( @xmath413 at @xmath414 ) .",
    "a very promising alternative is to consider again a heavy ion beam , and to exploit the contribution of the inverse beta decay reaction , @xmath415 to the rate  ( [ eq : acc_rate ] ) .",
    "this reaction changes the charge of the nucleus , causing it to follow an extraordinary trajectory and finally to exit the machine such that it becomes susceptible to detection  @xcite .",
    "a detection of this reaction would also clearly demonstrate that a neutrino was involved in the scattering .      in the meantime",
    ", until the ulhc has been constructed , target detection of the relic neutrinos has to rely on extremely energetic cosmic rays .",
    "in fact , cosmic rays with up energies up to @xmath416 have been seen by air shower observatories .",
    "the corresponding c.m .",
    "energies are @xmath417 when scattering off the relic neutrinos",
    ". these energies are not too far from the @xmath370- and @xmath22-resonances , at which the electroweak cross sections become sizeable .",
    "indeed , it was pointed out long ago by weiler  @xcite ( for earlier suggestions , see @xcite ) that the resonant annihilation of extremely energetic cosmic neutrinos ( eec@xmath418 ) with relic anti - neutrinos ( and vice versa ) into @xmath22-bosons appears to be a unique process having sensitivity to the relic neutrinos . on resonance , @xmath419 the associated cross section is enhanced by several orders of magnitude , @xmath420 leading to a `` short '' mean free path @xmath421 which is _ only _ about @xmath422 times the hubble distance",
    ". neglecting cosmic evolution effects , this corresponds to an annihilation probability for eec@xmath418 from cosmological distances on the relic neutrinos of @xmath423 .",
    "the signatures of annihilation are ( i ) absorption dips  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the eec@xmath418 spectrum at the resonant energies , and ( ii ) emission features  @xcite ( @xmath22-bursts ) as protons ( or photons ) with energies spanning a decade or more above the predicted greisen  zatsepin",
    " kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff at @xmath424  ev  @xcite .",
    "this is the energy beyond which the cmb is absorbing to nucleons due to resonant photopion production .- bursts with the mysterious cosmic rays observed above @xmath425 is a controversial possibility  @xcite . ]",
    "the possibility to confirm the existence of relic neutrinos within the next decade from a measurement of the aforementioned absorption dips in the eec@xmath418 flux was recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "presently planned neutrino detectors ( pierre auger observatory  @xcite , icecube  @xcite , anita  @xcite , euso  @xcite , owl  @xcite , and salsa  @xcite ) operating in the energy regime above @xmath426 appear to be sensitive enough to lead us , within the next decade , into an era of relic neutrino absorption spectroscopy , provided that the flux of the eec@xmath418 at the resonant energies is close to current observational bounds and the neutrino mass is sufficiently large , @xmath427 .",
    "in this case , the associated @xmath22-bursts must also be seen as post - gzk events at the planned cosmic ray detectors ( pierre auger observatory , euso , and owl ) .",
    "= 15.7 cm    what are the implications of relic neutrino clustering for absorption and emission spectroscopy ?",
    "firstly , absorption spectroscopy is predominantly sensitive to the relic neutrino background at early times , with the depths of the absorption dips determined largely by the higher number densities at large redshifts ( @xmath428 ) . since neutrinos do not cluster significantly until after @xmath429 , clustering at recent times can only show up as secondary dips with such minimal widths in energy  @xcite that they do not seem likely to be resolved by planned observatories .",
    "on the other hand , emission spectroscopy is directly sensitive to the relic neutrino content of the local universe ( @xmath430 ) .",
    "however , since the neutrino density contrasts approximately track those of the underlying cdm above the neutrino free - streaming scale @xmath206 ( cf .",
    "section  [ linear ] ) , it is clear that there can not be a substantial neutrino overdensity over the whole gzk volume ( @xmath431 ) .",
    "indeed , if we take the linear fitting formula ( [ eq : nufilter ] ) , and apply it to the local cdm distribution inferred from peculiar velocity measurements ( with a @xmath4 smoothing    ) , one can see in figure  [ fig : local ] that the estimated neutrino overdensity is always @xmath432 .",
    "hence the overall emission rate can not be significantly enhanced by gravitational clustering .",
    "or we could imagine doing `` relic neutrino tomography '' of the local universe , by exploiting the fact that there are several galaxy clusters ( @xmath433 ) , such as virgo ( distance @xmath434 ) and centaurus ( @xmath435 ) , within the gzk zone with significant neutrino clustering ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : overdensities ] ) .",
    "one could conceivably search for directional dependences in the emission events as a signature of eec@xmath418 annihilating on relic anti - neutrinos ( and vice versa ) .",
    "for example , agasa has an angular resolution of @xmath436 @xcite .",
    "this is already sufficient to resolve the internal structures of , say , the virgo cluster ( distance @xmath434 , @xmath437 ) which spans some @xmath438 across the sky .",
    "using our @xmath6-@xmath16-body clustering results in figure  [ fig : overdensities ] , the average neutrino overdensity along the line of sight towards and up to virgo is estimated to be @xmath439 and @xmath440 for @xmath441 and @xmath297 respectively , given an angular resolution of @xmath436 .",
    "the corresponding increases in the number of events coming from the direction of the virgo cluster relative to the unclustered case , assuming an isotropic distribution of eec@xmath418 sources , are given roughly by the same numbers , since protons originating from @xmath434 away arrive at earth approximately unattenuated .",
    "the numbers improve to @xmath442 and @xmath443 respectively with a finer @xmath444 angular resolution .",
    "note that our estimates here are generally a factor of few higher than the predictions of sm .",
    "this is expected , because the linear method adopted in their analysis can not account for additional clustering from nonlinear effects , as we demonstrated in section  [ linear ] .",
    "we have conducted a systematic and exhaustive study of the gravitational clustering of big bang relic neutrinos onto existing cdm and baryonic structures within the flat @xmath0cdm model , with the aim of understanding their clustering properties on galactic and sub - galactic scales for the purpose of designing possible scattering - based detection methods .",
    "our main computational tools are ( i ) a restricted , @xmath6-@xmath16-body method ( section  [ onebody ] ) , in which we neglect the gravitational interaction between the neutrinos and treat them as test particles moving in an external potential generated by the cdm / baryonic structures , and ( ii ) a semi - analytical , linear technique ( section  [ linear ] ) , which requires additional assumptions about the neutrino phase space distribution . in both cases ,",
    "the cdm / baryonic gravitational potentials are calculated from parametric halo density profiles from high resolution @xmath6-body studies @xcite ( section  [ profiles ] ) and/or from realistic mass distributions reconstructed from observational data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "using these two computational techniques , we track the relic neutrinos accretion onto cdm halos ranging from the galaxy to the galaxy cluster variety ( @xmath445 ) , and determine the neutrino number densities on scales @xmath446 for neutrino masses satisfying current constraints ( [ eq : massbound ] ) from cmb and lss ( figures  [ fig : overdensities ] and [ fig : nuvscdm ] ) .",
    "because we can simulate only a finite set of halo and neutrino parameters , we provide also additional plots illustrating the approximate dependences of the neutrino overdensities on the halo and neutrino masses ( figures  [ fig : halomass ] and [ fig : msquare ] ) .",
    "these can be used for interpolation between simulation results .",
    "furthermore , we find that the linear technique systematically underestimates the neutrino overdensities over the whole range of halo and neutrino masses considered in this study ( figure  [ fig : overdensities ] ) .",
    "reconciliation with @xmath6-@xmath16-body simulations can only be achieved if we impose a smoothing scale of @xmath447 , or if the overdensity is no more than three or four .",
    "we therefore conclude that the linear theory does not generally constitute a faithful approximation to the vlasov equation in the study of neutrino clustering on galactic and sub - galactic scales ( @xmath448 )",
    ". however , it may still be useful for finding the minimum effects of neutrino clustering in other contexts not considered in this work ( e.g. , the nonlinear matter power spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "next we apply our @xmath6-@xmath16-body method to calculate the relic neutrino number density in the milky way ( section  [ milkyway ] ) , especially their phase space distribution in our local neighbourhood at earth @xmath216 , taking also into account contributions to the total gravitational potential from the galactic bulge and disk .",
    "we find a maximum overdensity of @xmath449 per neutrino flavour in our immediate vicinity , provided that the neutrino mass is at its current upper limit of @xmath450 ( table  [ table : moments ] and figure  [ fig : milkyway ] ) . for neutrino masses less than @xmath297 ,",
    "the expected overdensity from gravitational clustering is less than two .",
    "the associated coarse - grained momentum spectra show varying degrees of deviation from the relativistic fermi  dirac function , but share a common feature that they are semi - degenerate , with phase space density @xmath451 , up to the momentum state corresponding to the escape velocity from the milky way at @xmath216 ( figure  [ fig : momentum ] ) .",
    "this means that the neutrino number densities we have calculated here for @xmath216 are already the _",
    "highest possible _ , given the neutrino mass , without violating phase space constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to attain even higher densities",
    ", one must now appeal to non - standard theories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in terms of scattering - based detection possibilities ,",
    "this meager enhancement in the neutrino number density in the milky way from gravitational clustering means that relic neutrinos are still far from being detected in fully earthbound laboratory experiments . for flux detection methods based on coherent elastic scattering of relic neutrinos off target matter in a terrestrial detector ( section  [ flux ] )",
    ", a positive detection could be thirty to forty years away @xcite , provided that light neutrinos are dirac particles . for light majorana neutrinos , another @xmath452 times more sensitivity",
    "would be required in the detector for a positive signal .",
    "target detection methods using accelerator beams ( section  [ accelerator ] ) seem equally hopeless , unless the accelerator is the size of the earth and operates at an energy of @xmath453 ( table  [ table : accelerators ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , target detection using extremely energetic cosmic neutrinos ( eec@xmath418 , @xmath454 ) remains the only viable means to confirm the existence of big bang relic neutrinos within the next decade or so ( section  [ uhecr ] ) .",
    "resonant annihilation of eec@xmath418 on relic neutrinos can be revealed as absorption dips in the eec@xmath418 flux ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or as emission features in the @xmath22-decay products .",
    "however , since absorption spectroscopy is largely insensitive to late time ( @xmath78 ) relic neutrino clustering , our findings here have little impact on the conclusions of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "emission spectroscopy is sensitive to the relic neutrino content of the local gzk zone , @xmath455 . while we find no significant large scale clustering within @xmath456 ( figure  [ fig : local ] ) and therefore no significant enhancement in the overall emission rates , it is still conceivable to exploit the considerable neutrino overdensities in nearby galaxy clusters , and search for directional dependences in the post - gzk emission events . for the virgo cluster , for example",
    ", we estimate the event rate from the central @xmath457 region to be @xmath442 and @xmath443 times the unclustered rate for neutrino mass @xmath441 and @xmath297 respectively , assuming an isotropic distribution of eec@xmath418 sources .",
    "[ our estimates differ by a factor of a few from the predictions of because their linear technique fails to account for additional clustering from nonlinear effects , as we have demonstrated in this study ( section  [ linear ] ) ] .",
    "planned observatories such as the pierre auger observatory @xcite , euso @xcite and owl @xcite will have sufficient angular resolution to , in principle , see this enhancement .",
    "however , considering the rapidly improving constraints on both the eec@xmath418 flux and neutrino masses , it remains to be seen if the enhancement can indeed be observed with enough statistical significance .",
    "we would like to thank david cerdeo , pasquale di bari , birgit eberle , jan hamann , oleg lebedev , helmut mais , and thomas reiter for useful discussions .",
    "we give in this appendix a detailed discussion of the techniques used in our @xmath6-@xmath16-body simulations .",
    "following @xcite , we begin with a lagrangian @xmath458 $ ] for a test particle ( neutrino ) with mass @xmath24 and peculiar velocity @xmath459 moving in a spherically symmetric gravitational potential well @xmath460 generated by the cdm halo . because of spherical symmetry , the motion of the test particle is confined to a plane .",
    "this allows us to switch to polar coordinates @xmath461 to obtain @xmath462,\\ ] ] and eliminate two superfluous variables in the process .",
    "the canonical momenta conjugate to @xmath222 and @xmath463 are @xmath464 and @xmath465 respectively , leading to the hamiltonian @xmath466 + a m_{\\nu } \\phi(r,\\tau),\\ ] ] and hence hamilton s equations @xmath467 where the last equality expresses the conservation of conjugate comoving angular momentum @xmath468 .    for computational purposes , it is convenient to rewrite the set of differential equations ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) in terms of redshift @xmath75 and the normalised quantities @xmath469 and @xmath470 , thus rendering ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) into the form @xmath471 where @xmath472 and @xmath473 are , respectively , the scale factor and the expansion rate , the latter of which is determined by the present day hubble constant @xmath474 and the cosmological model in hand .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath475 obeys the poisson equation @xmath476 since we are treating the cdm halo as a density perturbation sitting on top of a uniform background , i.e. , @xmath477 , we have the following ( partial ) solution : @xmath478 where @xmath227 is the physical mass contained in a sphere of radius @xmath222 . for an nfw halo , @xmath479 the meanings of these various symbols",
    "are explained in section  [ profiles ] .",
    "the number of neutrinos at some initial time @xmath480 in the interval @xmath481 is defined to be @xmath482 we assume the initial phase space distribution to be isotropic and homogeneous , i.e. , @xmath483 .",
    "this initial homogeneity implies that the ensemble s subsequent evolution under a spherically symmetric potential will depend only on the initial radial distance @xmath222 , radial momentum @xmath484 , and transverse momentum @xmath485 .",
    "thus we may rewrite the phase space volume element as @xmath486 with @xmath487 , @xmath488 $ ] , @xmath489 , and @xmath490 , @xmath491 , @xmath492 .    in an ideal and perfectly deterministic calculation , one would track the motion of every particle for every occupied combination of @xmath222 , @xmath484 and @xmath493 .",
    "this is obviously impossible in practice ; one must therefore resort to simulating only a representative set of particles and endow each with a `` weight '' according to the phase space region from which the particle is drawn .",
    "we show below how this weight is calculated .- body simulations @xcite .",
    "the representative point particles are drawn randomly from the initial phase space distribution . ]",
    "suppose that a point particle initially at @xmath494 is representative for all particles in the initial phase space interval @xmath495 .",
    "the weight carried by this representative particle is defined as @xmath496 where @xmath497 means summing over all @xmath463 , @xmath71 and @xmath498 , which is simple : @xmath499 .",
    "the spatial integral over @xmath222 is also readily calculable . the remaining phase space integral @xmath500 can be solved by way of the parameterisation @xmath501 , and @xmath502 , and hence @xmath503 thus the weight carried by a point particle centred on and representing the interval @xmath504 is given by @xmath505 where @xmath506 is a dimensionless momentum variable .",
    "we construct the neutrino density profiles from the discrete outputs of our @xmath6-@xmath16-body simulations using the kernel method of @xcite and @xcite , which we reproduce here for completeness .",
