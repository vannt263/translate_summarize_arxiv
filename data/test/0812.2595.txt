    "anderson s theorem tells us that the @xmath5-wave superconductivity is insensitive to small potential scattering @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath6-wave superconductivity has zero superconducting gap in the nodal direction , and thus may be sensitive to disorder .",
    "however , experimental observation of the high - temperature superconductivity , which many people are nowadays convinced has @xmath6-wave symmetry , seems robust against disorder @xcite .",
    "for example , the high - temperature superconductors seem to exhibit more conventional behavior at higher hole doping rates where the systems are supposed to be more disordered . furthermore , the local density of states measured by the stm @xcite show clear v - shape at low energy that indicates the @xmath6-wave nodes are not much influenced by disorder .",
    "theoretically , it is proposed that this protection of v - shape is due to strong coulomb repulsion between electrons @xcite . hence , detailed studies of effects of strong correlation for impurity scattering are necessary .    in correlated systems ,",
    "the model parameters are effectively renormalized .",
    "for example , a hopping term is renormalized by a factor smaller than unity because hopping is more difficult in the presence of the double occupancy prohibition . on the other hand",
    ", an exchange term is renormalized by a factor larger than unity because each site is more often singly occupied . then",
    ", the question is : how are impurity terms renormalized ? in our previous paper@xcite , we have presented preliminary results of the impurity renormalization .",
    "that is , local modulations of the hopping and the exchange term tend to be enhanced by the local renormalization factors , and impurity potential tends to be screened by the effective local chemical potentials originated from minimization of the total energy . in this paper",
    ", we investigate in more detail how impurity potential is renormalized , using the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method and the gutzwiller - projected bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation@xcite , then discuss agreement and disagreement with the experiments .",
    "an extensive amount of literature has been devoted for the impact of impurities on the normal and superconducting state of the cuprates . a detailed review dedicated to this subject",
    "was recently given by alloul _",
    "@xcite we do not repeat the whole review here , but the theoretical side may be summarized as follows : suppose electrons in host metal interact with each other by the onsite repulsive hubbard @xmath7 terms , and let us put a _ non - magnetic _ impurity in it .",
    "then , very strong impurity potential ( unitary scatterer ) , such as a cavity in otherwise uniform systems , tends to induce local magnetic moments near the impurity if @xmath7 is large enough , whereas weak potential ( born scatterer ) does not .",
    "however , the local moment formation in the superconducting state seems relatively controversial .",
    "the moments appear according to the theory based on the mean - field decoupling of the @xmath7 term , e.g. , by chen and ting @xcite , and harter _",
    "although it can be a good approximation for small @xmath7 , yet antiferromagnetic correlation is probably underestimated especially at large @xmath7 because the superexchange process is not taken into account explicitly .",
    "considering that the local moments typically appear at sufficiently large @xmath7 , it is critical to know in what range of @xmath7 the theory is valid .",
    "an interesting contrast is in the theory by tsuchiura _",
    "@xcite based on the one - site removed @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath3 model , i.e. , an effective @xmath8 model .",
    "they adopted two different gutzwiller approximations that lead to two different bdg equations .",
    "one of them takes away the double occupancy prohibition in return for the _ uniform _ renormalization of model parameters .",
    "this calculation results in the local moment formation .",
    "it also indicates that @xmath3 may cause the appearance of the local moment even if @xmath9 because this effective model is a `` @xmath9 but finite @xmath3 '' system . in the other bdg equation of them",
    ", each local model parameter is dressed with an extended gutzwiller renormalization factor that depends on the position .",
    "this calculation in contrast results in the absence of the local moments because electrons tend to avoid the impurity and the antiferromagnetism locally collapses .",
    "however , these local renormalization factors are , without local derivation , speculated from the previously derived formula for the _ uniform _ system @xcite , and may need to be verified in the future studies .",
    "tsuchiura s work was criticized by wang and lee @xcite , who applied an inhomogeneous slave - boson mean - field theory to essentially the same model .",
    "the result shows the local magnetic moments in the underdoped region . in the slave - boson mean - field theory ,",
    "the double occupancy prohibition is relaxed by the saddle point approximation and only its average is satisfied , which probably reduces the influence of the spin - spin interaction effectively . to compensate it ,",
    "wang and lee added a phenomenological residual spin - spin interaction term , and the result depends on its magnitude .",
    "in addition , gabay _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite recently obtained similar results .",
    "liang and lee@xcite applied the vmc and also concluded that local moments appear in the underdoped regime .",
    "the strong scatterers introduced above are modeled on in - plane impurities which substitute for cu in the cuo@xmath10 planes . besides such unitary scatterers",
    ", all cuprate materials are doped by out - of - plane ions that mostly occupy random positions in the crystal lattice or interstitial positions .",
    "such intrinsic impurities may be weak , but can be poorly screened by electrons around them because the cuprates are quasi  two - dimensional metal .",
    "in addition , these weak potentials are not expected to induce local magnetism .",
    "influence of these `` born scattering potentials '' on the local density of states was studied by , e.g. , wang and lee , @xcite , and nunner _",

    "it is worthy to be noted that the bcs theory has predicted the matrix elements of the impurity potential and the total spectral weights are @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively . on the other hand ,",

    "this is possibly related to the position dependence of @xmath105 .",
    "originally , the impurity potential is nonzero only at the impurity site .",
    "however , after solving the bdg equation , the renormalized impurity potential distributes more broadly as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vvsi ] .",
    "namely , as @xmath95 becomes larger and @xmath47 becomes smaller , the renormalization effect reduces at the impurity site whereas it broadens toward the neighboring sites .",
    "this broadening can be understood as follows : basically , energy loss by the impurity potential reduces electron occupation at the impurity site",

    "then , the hamiltonian can be block - diagonalized by the fourier transform with respect to the supercell indices , and the calculation of expectation values is reduced to an average over many quasi - twisted boundary conditions of the 24@xmath8224 site system .",

    "@xcite pointed out for the conventional bdg equation with smoothly varying potential that the ldos at site @xmath152 is similar to the dos in the uniform system with shifted chemical potential @xmath153 .",
    "this argument can be also applied to our system .",
    "however , the gutzwiller renormalization factors make a difference in the relation among the hole density @xmath154 , the gap energy , and the height of the coherence peaks . in the systems without the gutzwiller projection , @xmath155 is determined by the dos near the fermi level .",
    "namely , @xmath155 takes maximum when the chemical potential is at the van hove singularity .",
    "accordingly , when @xmath155 is large , the gap energy and the peak height are also large . in contrast , with the gutzwiller renormalization factors , as @xmath52 , ( i ) the band shrinks by @xmath118 and thus the dos near the fermi level increases , and ( ii ) the pairing interaction is enhanced by @xmath119 . because of ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) , @xmath155 and the gap energy monotonically increases as @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , the ldos contains an extra factor @xmath156 , and thus the peak height decreases as @xmath47 decreases .    note that this anticorrelation between the gap energy and the peak height as well as the large gap distribution is consistent with the experiments @xcite .",
    "however , according to our calculation , the large spatial variation in the ldos accompanies large variation in the hole density , which has yet to be verified by the experiments .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the renormalization of the impurity potential by the strong correlation .",
    "the vmc calculation has shown that impurity potential scattering matrix elements between gutzwiller - projected quasi - particle excited states are as strongly renormalized as the hopping terms .",
    "it may be understood by the fourier transform of the @xmath4-function impurity potential having a form of the hopping term in @xmath41 space .",
    "the ( real - space ) hopping term is known to be renormalized by a factor less than unity because it is more difficult to hop in the presence of the double occupancy prohibition . even in @xmath41 space , if electrons are densely packed in the lattice , it must be similarly difficult to hop from @xmath41 to @xmath157 , then the impurity potential and the hopping term should be renormalized similarly .    such reduction in the impurity potential is also seen by the bdg equation with local gutzwiller renormalization factors . near the half filling of the strongly correlated systems , the influence of the non - magnetic impurity potential on the ground state is small because each site has to be occupied by almost one electron in any case .",
    "however , the impurity potential _ does _ affect the ground - state energy .",
    "such properties appear by taking into account effective local chemical potential , which is paid little attention to in the literature .",
    "in addition , the local chemical potential effectively broadens the impurity potential because holes prefer to move around to gain the kinetic energy .",
    "effect of smoothly varying impurity potential has been briefly discussed .",
    "it shows large gap distribution .",
    "if the gutzwiller renormalization factors are taken into account , the gap energy and the peak height are anticorrelated .",
    "these properties are consistent with the experiments @xcite .    in fair comparison , there are also some disagreements with the experiments . according to our results ,",
    "short - range non - magnetic potential variations are reduced , thus the system is more uniform , and accordingly the @xmath6-wave superconductivity can be robust . however , in the experiments , the system seems quite disordered but still the @xmath6-wave is robust .",
    "such short - range disorder may be introduced by spatial modulation of @xmath158 or @xmath3 , which can be enhanced by the strong correlation @xcite , or by magnetic impurities , or by the electron - lattice interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition , although the smooth impurity potential variation yields anticorrelation between the gap energy and the peak height , it does not show the almost spatially independent v - shaped ldos at low energy seen often in the experiments , which can be explained instead in the case of the rapid potential variation@xcite .",
    "in our previous paper@xcite , we have discussed the ldos of stripe states , where @xmath155 contains two components ; one is spatially uniform and the other is oscillating , typically with wave number @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",
    "then , the v - shaped gap is determined by the uniform component , and the oscillating component influences it little . as a result ,",
    "the linear slope of v - shape is robust ( it does not have much spatial dependence ) .",
    "this is rather counterintuitive because one may think that the local gap could be determined by @xmath155 .",
    "however , the superconducting gap is not determined by such local properties , but by `` coherence '' , i.e. , spatial dependence of @xmath155 .",
    "let us recall that , in the case of the zero - momentum pairing as the conventional bcs theory , the spin - up electron band couples with the spin - down hole band ( upside - down spin - down electron band ) ; these bands intersect at the fermi level , and a gap opens by a nonzero superconducting order parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillating components contain only pairing with nonzero center - of - mass momentum .",
    "then , the spin - up electron band couples with the @xmath161-shifted ( or multiples - of-@xmath161 shifted ) spin - down hole band . the point is , these bands typically intersect not at the fermi level except for limited points . in such cases , the v - shape of the ldos",
    "is not affected a lot .",
    "similarly , oscillations of the variational parameters other than @xmath155 with wave number @xmath161 mix `` the bare band '' and `` the bands shifted by multiples of @xmath161 '' . such terms change the band structure especially near band intersections .",
    "however , this change in the band structure is not related to the superconductivity , at least in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the superconducting dos depends on where one puts the chemical potential , but general properties near the v - shaped ldos is determined by @xmath155 .",
    "the smooth impurity potential variation considered in sec .  [ sec : smooth ] is similar to the stripe states with @xmath162 . since @xmath161 is small , the oscillating components of @xmath155 has effect similar to the uniform component @xmath163 .",
    "namely , it affects every state at the fermi level .",
    "however , the gap has now spatial dependence because @xmath161 is not completely zero . in this case",
    ", the local gap is determined by @xmath155 ; the ldos at sites @xmath14 is similar to the dos in the uniform system with @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , there is nothing like the `` uniform component '' in the argument of the stripe state , and thus the linear slope of v - shape in the ldos is not robust anymore .",
    "this issue will be addressed in the future .",
    "the authors thank c .- m .  ho for stimulating discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the national science council in taiwan with grant no.95 - 2112-m-001 - 061-my3 .",
    "part of the numerical calculation was performed in the ibm cluster 1350 , the formosa ii cluster and the triton cluster in the national center for high - performance computing in taiwan , and the pc farm ii of academia sinica computing center in taiwan .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : ldos ] , the @xmath4-function potential causes asymmetry in the ldos near the impurity site . such asymmetry may be important because some stm experiments analyze data by taking the ratio between intensities of positive and negative bias @xcite : the symmetric part of the ldos is canceled and its asymmetric",
    "part remains .",
    "to explain the origin of the asymmetry , let us diagonalize the bdg hamiltonian of a simple two - site problem analytically in the following .",
    "we know that it is not realistic to apply the mean - field approximation to two - site problems .",
    "however , it provides us some insight into numerical solutions in the bulk systems .",
    "suppose the potentials at sites 1 and 2 are @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) and @xmath169 , respectively . by putting the states in the order of electrons @xmath170 , @xmath171 , and holes @xmath172 , @xmath173 ,",
    "the bdg hamiltonian matrix is written as @xmath174 let us start from a simple case of @xmath175 and assume @xmath176 . then , @xmath177 mixes @xmath170 electron and @xmath173 hole with the equal weights .",
    "we call the linear combination of them with positive and negative energy the quasi - particle a@xmath178 and a@xmath179 , respectively .",
    "similarly , b@xmath180 denotes the linear combination of @xmath171 electron and @xmath172 hole with positive / negative energy .    if @xmath181 , a and b are degenerate . finite but small @xmath167 causes energy difference between a and b , namely , @xmath182 , @xmath183 . in the ground state , a@xmath179 and b@xmath179 are occupied , but a@xmath178 and b@xmath178 are unoccupied .",
    "first we focus on 1@xmath184 .",
    "then , the electron addition spectrum is at @xmath185 , the removal is at @xmath186 .",
    "namely , the finite v just shifts the whole spectra by @xmath167 , and the local spectra are not symmetric around @xmath187 . on the other hand , the spectra of site 2 shift by @xmath169 . as a result ,",
    "the spectra summed over sites 1 and 2 are still symmetric . as for 1@xmath188 ,",
    "the addition is at @xmath189 , and the removal is at @xmath190 ( these negative signs originate from the treatment of 1@xmath188 as a hole ) , which are identical to the spectra of 1@xmath184 as expected .",
    "next , let us consider @xmath191 . then , @xmath0 mixes a@xmath178 and b@xmath179 , and the eigenstates are linear combinations of them whose eigenenergies are @xmath192^{1/2 } $ ] .",
    "the eigenenergies of superposition of a@xmath179 and b@xmath178 are @xmath193^{1/2 } $ ] . as @xmath0 increases ,",
    "the ldos asymmetry becomes weaker , but it never disappears .    back to the bulk systems , maybe we can physically explain the asymmetry as follows . since @xmath3 term causes pairing , a cooper pair is formed more or less between nearest neighbors ( site 1,2 ) when a snapshot is taken .",
    "this cooper pair is a resonance of `` states where sites 1 and 2 are occupied by electrons '' and `` states where both are occupied by holes '' .",
    "destruction of the pair leaves a quasi - particle .",
    "there are two possibilities for it ; ( i ) an `` electron at site 1 and hole at site 2 '' , and ( ii ) an `` electron at 2 and hole at 1 '' .",
    "the @xmath4-function potential lifts the degeneracy of these quasi - particles .",
    "that results in the asymmetry in the local spectra although the bulk spectra are symmetric as in the two - site problem above . in the bulk system ,",
    "the spectra are continuous , and the spectral shift by the impurity potential is larger at high energy than at low energy because ( i ) the near - nodal quasi - particles at low energy are less influenced by the impurity potential because there are not many states to mix with , and ( ii ) the shift is caused by @xmath177 and it is smaller at lower energy .",
