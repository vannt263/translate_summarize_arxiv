    "according to the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , the most abundant elements in the aftermath of the big bang were hydrogen and helium with very small traces of deuterium and lithium .",
    "these elements make up the so called pop iii or _ primordial _ chemical composition . all the heavier elements present",
    "today had to be produced in the course of the evolution of several generations of stars .    in order to understand the physics of the early universe",
    ", there is a need of having appropriate and accurate material functions at hand , in particular opacities for a sbbn chemical compositions .",
    "there is a large body of literature available with opacity calculations for metal - free ( z=0 ) h / he mixtures , starting with the paczynski i - vi mixtures ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) , the calculations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) , and more recently ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) .",
    "these calculations were restricted to temperatures between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "specific metal - free opacity sets have been calculated by the op project ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath5 ) and opal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6 ) .",
    "more recently , opal calculations have been extended @xcite to @xmath7 and densities is a parameter which replaces the density in order to keep opacity tables in rectangular format when spanning many decades in temperature ( for more details see appendix [ sect : tblfmt ] ) ; @xmath8 @xmath9 with the main application for cno enhanced opacities in stellar evolution .",
    "all these opacity calculations , however , only considered pure hydrogen / helium mixtures with no metals ( mass fraction @xmath10 ) , but different ratios @xmath11 of the mass fractions of hydrogen ( @xmath12 ) and helium ( @xmath13 ) . it has been argued that due to the assumed very small abundances of deuterium and lithium these element do not play any significant role in the opacities and thus in the evolution of pop iii objects .    moreover , while there are good low - temperature opacities available for a solar chemical composition ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , zero - metallicity opacity tabulations have been restricted to temperatures above @xmath14 so far .",
    "in this paper we present calculations of both , rosseland and planck mean opacities for primordial matter including all the three elements ( hydrogen , helium , and lithium ) including deuterium isotope and present their absorption properties .    in sect .",
    "[ sect : matter ] we discuss the quantitative composition of primordial matter at a given temperature and density .",
    "we then describe the relevant absorption processes ( sect.[sect : absproc ] ) and present our rosseland and planck mean opacities ( sect .",
    "[ sect : rossplanck ] ) . here",
    ", we also assess the influence of lithium on the opacity for different lithium contents . before we compare our results to previous tabulations ( sect.[sect : compare ] ) , we give analytic calculations for the molecule formation timescale in sect . [",
    "sect : chemequilibrium ] in order to estimate the time needed to reach chemical equilibrium which is one of the underlying assumptions in our calculations . finally , we summarize our conclusions in sect .  [",

    "primordial matter as created in the sbbn consists of hydrogen ( h ) , helium ( he ) , deuterium ( d ) , and lithium ( li ) . before wmap@xcite",
    ", the observed abundances of these elements have been used to constrain the baryon - to - photon ratio . in the framework of a @xmath15cdm cosmology wmap provided the value this parameter with high accuracy . while the abundances of h and he were fairly well known for some time , the uncertainties in the determination of the abundances of d and li were significantly reduced .",
    "now , the d abundance as derived from cosmological parameters is consistent with direct observations , while the observed li abundance still lacks a factor of 3 compared to the sbbn results .",
    "this may indicate either systematic effects in the observations or new physics ( for an in - depth discussion of this issue , see * ? ? ?",
    "we summarize the resultant abundances according to sbbn and wmap in table [ tbl : abundances ] ( after * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : comparisons]a ) is good as long as @xmath16 is the dominant absorption mechanism . for low temperatures ,",
    "the deviations are due to the use of cia data of @xcite and @xcite while we use the more recent borysow data .",
    "the deviations at higher temperatures and densities are due to the influence of the stark broadening of h lines which have been neglected in the calculation .",
    "the comparison with @xcite is done for both rosseland and planck means ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisons]b&c ) .    at higher temperatures and densities",
    "the deviations in the rosseland mean are again due to stark broadened h lines . for lower temperatures the deviations are only in the 20 - 30 % range , much smaller than with respect to .",
    "this is due to their use of the partially newly available cia data of @xmath17 and @xmath18 collisions for the roto - vibrational and roto - translational transitions while still having to use extrapolations for the overtones ( using data by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the planck means the differences are considerably higher .",
    "this is due to the linearity of planck averaging which prefers peaks in the opacity ( cia at low temperatures , h lines at higher temperatures and lower densities ) .",
    "the comparison to the opal opacities for the grevesse & noel chemical composition at z=0 shows a much better concordance over a larger temperature range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisons]d&e ) .",
    "in the high - temperature limit ( @xmath19 ) the rosseland mean opacities are consistent at the 10% level ( stark broadening ) .",
    "for the very highest temperatures , deviations are due to the approximation of the statistical weight of h by the ground state which no longer is true . at lower temperatures we again have a 10 - 20% deviation due to cia .",
    "while the inclusion of stark broadening for the rosseland means shows a good consistence with the opal data , there are deviations in the planck means .",
    "these differences are due to our coarse frequency grid which does not correctly trace all the peaks of the hydrogen lines .      the comparison to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparisons]f shows an overall good agreement with our data .",
    "the discussion is analogous to the opal comparison . except that now we are consistent at the 10% level accuracy for lower temperatures due to their use of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and more recent @xmath17 and @xmath18 cia data .",
    "at densities @xmath22 and temperatures @xmath23 there are , however , important differences .",
    "these are due to s use of two different approaches to calculate the @xmath24 abundance in order to overcome machine accuracy problems . in their @xmath25 dominated regime",
    ", they take a dissociation energy of @xmath26 whereas we take @xmath27 ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our calculations",
    ", we do not find any problems regarding machine accuracy .",
    "the second reason for the deviations is probably due to the difference in @xmath28 absorption coefficients where we use the @xcite data while they use @xcite .",
    "rosseland and planck mean opacities for primordial matter have been calculated using the most recent available data for the absorption mechanisms .",
    "we tabulate the opacity data in tables  e1 , e2 and e3 , for a temperature range @xmath29 and @xmath30 for our pop iii matter composition ( cf .",
    "table [ tbl : abundances ] ) .",
    "these are the first pop iii opacity tables for temperatures @xmath31 .    in order to make application as easy as possible",
    ", we provide two sets of planck opacities : planck means including only continuum absorption and those including molecular lines .",
    "higher resolution tables including routines for bicubic interpolation tables are available from the authors upon request .",
    "it has been shown ( see sect . [",
    "sect : rossplanck ] and [ sect : quantlithium ] ) that the small number fraction of li leads to a significant change in the opacity values at temperatures @xmath32k compared to a pure h / he mixture .",
    "the differences can reach up to 2 orders of magnitudes .",
    "there are four processes which change the opacity :    as an alkali metal , li gets ionized at comparatively low temperatures .",
    "it therefore increases the number of available electrons considerably .",
    "they increase the thomson scattering contribution to the rosseland mean at low densities while increasing the @xmath33 absorption at higher densities . for both the planck continuum and line case only the @xmath33 absorption at low densities ( no scattering )",
    "is enhanced .    in the presence of metals ( e.g. lithium )",
    "@xmath34 is being destroyed . as @xmath34 is the most abundant positive ion at temperatures around @xmath35 and densities",
    "@xmath36 it influences the opacity indirectly in changing the chemical equilibrium when being destroyed .",
    "furthermore , in part it shows up directly via bound - bound transitions of @xmath34 at intermediate densities . for higher densities",
    "this is being drowned by the indirect increase of the @xmath33-absorption .",
    "the planck means including line absorption are changed due to absorption by atomic li and molecular lih .    for atomic li",
    "the most important transition is the @xmath37 feature .",
    "the planck function , however , is most sensible to features at @xmath37 for temperatures of approx .",
    "@xmath38 , a temperature at which li is ionized , at the latest . absorption via this transition is still important at temperatures around @xmath39 because the corresponding einstein coefficient is very large compared to the quadrupole transitions of molecular and atomic h.    at temperatures @xmath40 the influence of @xmath25 is ceasing as the lowest lying transition of @xmath25 has an equivalent temperature of @xmath41 . for lower temperatures",
    "either @xmath42 or @xmath43 contribute to the opacities .",
    ", however , has got a larger dipole moment and thus has got much larger einstein coefficients and transitions at much lower temperatures ( as low as @xmath44 ) .",
    "a critical point in primordial chemistry is the formation of molecules .",
    "formation times have been calculated for @xmath25 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for densities",
    "@xmath45 molecule formation proceeds within one free - fall time ( except @xmath42 , which does not play any significant role in the pop iii case ) .",
    "hence the calculation is valid for densities larger than that , provided the free - fall time scale being the shortest timescale relevant , other than the chemical .",
    "we give values for densities as low as @xmath46 for numerical convenience .    in comparison to previous calculations",
    "we find a good agreement of our results when neglecting the newly added absorption mechanisms and the contributions of li .    based on our new opacities the influence of li on the different stages of pop iii star formation and evolution can now be assessed .",
