    "the hadron dynamics is ruled by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in a spirit of the elementary particle physics",
    ", it is desired to comprehend the hadron system directly from qcd . however , due to its strong - coupling nature , it is still difficult to extract the hadron dynamics from qcd in an analytic manner . instead",
    ", the lattice qcd calculation has been adopted as a promising method for the nonperturbative analysis of qcd .    in the first half of this paper , we study the three - quark ( 3q ) potential in lattice qcd .",
    "the inter - quark potential is one of the most fundamental and important quantities in qcd , and is directly responsible for the hadron properties .",
    "in contrast with lots of lattice studies for the quark - antiquark ( q-@xmath6 ) potential , there had been no reliable lattice - qcd result on the 3q potential , although the 3q potential is responsible for the baryon properties and of great importance also for the quark - confinement mechanism in baryons . on the ground - state",
    "3q potential @xmath0 , the detailed study has been recently performed , and y - ansatz is now almost conclusive  @xcite .    in the latter half of this paper , we consider the connection between qcd and the quark model in terms of the excited - state inter - quark potential .",
    "the low - lying hadron properties , especially for baryons , can be successfully reproduced in the framework of the simple non - relativistic quark model  @xcite , which has only quark degrees of freedom and has no gluonic modes .",
    "the non - relativistic treatment can be justified by spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking , which gives rise to a large constituent quark mass of about 300 mev . on the other hand",
    ", we have no reason which supports the absence of the gluonic excitation modes in the low - lying hadron spectra . to give a solution to this mystery",
    ", we investigate the gluonic excitation modes . in spite of several lattice studies on the gluonic excitation mode in the q-@xmath6 system ,",
    "the gluonic excited - state potential in the 3q system has not been investigated in lattice qcd .",
    "we show the first result on the 1st excited - state potential @xmath1 in the spatially - fixed 3q system in su(3 ) lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "the q-@xmath6 potential is described by a simple form as @xmath10 . in a theoretical conjecture , due to the confinement effect at the large distance , the color - electric flux among the quarks",
    "is expected to be squeezed as the color - flux - tube , and the quarks are linked with the one - dimensional flux - tube , which leads to the linear potential . reflecting the su(3 ) gauge symmetry in qcd",
    ", the color - flux - tube in the 3q system has a junction which connects three different colors in a color - singlet manner . in the ground state of the 3q system ,",
    "the flux - tube energy proportional to its length is minimized in the presence of the junction , and therefore the y - type flux - tube is expected to be formed among the three quarks  @xcite .",
    "thus , similarly in the q-@xmath6 potential , the 3q potential@xcite is conjectured to be expressed by a sum of a constant , the two - body coulomb term from the perturbative oge process at the short distance and the three - body linear confinement term at the long distance : @xmath11 with the minimal value @xmath12 of the total length of color - flux - tubes linking three quarks .     the lattice qcd result for the flux - tube profile in the spatially - fixed 3q system in the maximally - abelian projected qcd  @xcite .",
    "the distance between the junction and each quark is about 0.5 fm . ]",
    "we extract the static 3q potential @xmath0 from the 3q wilson loop @xcite using su(3 ) lattice qcd calculations in the model - independent way . for the accurate measurement of @xmath0",
    ", we adopt the gauge - covariant smearing method , which enhances the ground - state overlap . for more than 300 patterns of the 3q systems",
    ", we investigate @xmath0 in lattice qcd with @xmath2 lattice at @xmath3 and with @xmath4 lattices at @xmath5 .    as a result",
    ", the 3q potential can be accurately described by the y - ansatz form in eq.([3qp ] ) within the 1%-level deviation . from the comparison with the q-@xmath6 potential , we find the universality of the string tension as @xmath7 and the one - gluon - exchange result as @xmath8 .",
    "this result is also supported by the recent lattice study on the flux - tube profile in the 3q system  @xcite .",
    "the y - type flux - tube is observed in the 3q system as shown in fig.1 .",
    "( in contrast , the theoretical basis of the @xmath13-ansatz in ref.@xcite insists on the absence of any flux - tube formation in the 3q system : neither y nor @xmath13 flux - tube is to be observed in their framework . )",
    "thus , the possibility of @xmath13-ansatz  @xcite is almost denied , and y - ansatz seems established for the 3q potential .",
    "color confinement mechanism in qcd leads to a squeezed color - flux - tube , and then the gluonic excitation is theoretically expected to appear as the vibrational mode of the color - flux - tube  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this type of the gluonic excitation is closely related to the hybrid mesons and the hybrid baryons , which consist of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , in the valence picture . in particular , the several states with the exotic quantum number such as @xmath16 can not be constructed with the simple quark picture .    as for the excited - state q-@xmath6 potential ,",
    "recent lattice studies indicate the form as @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , the vibrational modes of the y - type flux - tube system are considered to be much more complicated and chaotic than those of the simple q-@xmath18 flux - tube , because of the possible interference among the vibrations of the three flux - tubes connected at the physical junction .",
    "the lattice qcd results of the ground - state 3q potential @xmath19 ( open circles ) and the 1st excited - state 3q potential @xmath20 ( filled circles ) as the function of @xmath12 .",
    "the gluonic excitation energy is found to be more than 1gev in the hadronic scale . ]",
    "we investigate the 1st excited - state potential in the spatially - fixed 3q system using lattice qcd with @xmath4 lattice at @xmath21=5.8 for 24 patterns of the 3q systems . in fig.2",
    ", we plot the ground - state potential @xmath19 and the 1st excited - state potential @xmath20 as the function of @xmath12 in the physical unit .    as a remarkable fact",
    ", the lowest gluonic excitation energy @xmath22 is found to be about 1gev in the hadronic scale as @xmath23 .",
    "this is rather large in comparison with the low - lying excitation energy of the quark origin .",
    "( also for the q-@xmath24 system , a large gluonic excitation energy is reported in recent lattice studies  @xcite . )",
    "such a gluonic excitation contribution would be significant in the highly - excited baryons with the excitation energy above 1gev , and the lowest hybrid baryon  @xcite , which is described as @xmath15 in the valence picture , is expected to have a large mass of about 2gev .    the large gluonic excitation energy corresponding to the flux - tube vibrational energy is considered to originate from the `` tight '' flux - tube with a large string tension , as a result of the strong confinement effect . due to the large gluonic excitation energy @xmath25 1gev , the gluonic excitation modes are invisible in the low - lying excitations of hadrons , which can be considered as a reason of the success of the simple quark model without gluonic modes  @xcite .",
    "( see fig.3 . )",
    "connection from qcd to the success of the quark model for low - lying hadrons .",
    "the large gluonic excitation energy @xmath25 1gev leads to the absence of the gluonic mode in the low - lying hadrons and brings about the great success of the quark model . ]",
