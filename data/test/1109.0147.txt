    "accordingly , the asymptotic decoherence rate is given by @xmath30 .",
    "decoherence of qubits is sometimes modelled by random unitary dynamics  @xcite .",
    "it is known that on the level of the reduced state , single - qubit decoherence can always be modelled that way , while for two qubits or more , there is genuine `` quantum '' decoherence ",
    "i.e. there is decoherence that  even on the reduced level  can only be modelled by coupling the system to a quantum environment  @xcite . considering a single qubit and its given quantum environment , this raises the question to",
    "what extent the total state involves any quantum correlations .",
    "in fact , the most general class of total initial states which allows for completely positive reduced dynamics is classically correlated , with zero discord  @xcite . we emphasize that for our special choice of the spectral density , the map @xmath31 induced by  ( [ equ : masterequation - decoherence ] ) is completely positive for all @xmath32 .",
    "this is due to the positivity of @xmath16 in our case , which also implies the `` markovianity '' of the reduced dynamics for all times in the sense of both works  @xcite .",
    "for all these recent investigations it is relevant to gain a deeper understanding of the build - up of quantum correlations between system and environment . in this paper",
    "we investigate the correlation dynamics of the total state for a mixed initial product state and identify entangled and classically correlated regimes .",
    "it turns out that in general the dynamics of system - environment correlations can be markedly rich .",

    "our approach here is a mixed - state generalization of the _ non - markovian quantum state diffusion _ approach to open quantum system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "we will combine the environmental coherent state labels into the vector @xmath34 of complex numbers and consistently make use of the notation @xmath35 ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "here we symbolically write @xmath42/{\\overline{n}}:=\\prod_\\lambda\\exp[-|\\xi_\\lambda|^2/{\\overline{n}}_\\lambda]/{\\overline{n}}_\\lambda$ ] .",
    "we find that expression  ( [ equ : p - representation ] ) is a solution of the total von - neumann equation with initial @xmath43 if @xmath44 where @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath46\\exp[b(t)-\\left\\{({b}(t)|\\xi)-(\\xi|b(t))\\right\\}]$ ] . here",

    "[ fig : volumeofstates ] we display the relative volume of the set of states that are still separable at @xmath22 , i.e. after decoherence .",
    "remarkably , in the regime where the master equation  ( [ equ : masterequation - decoherence ] ) is of lindblad form ( @xmath77 ) for practically all states decoherence has long happened before any entanglement between system an environment can build up .",
    "in fact , this is not too surprising : in the weak coupling limit ( `` born approximation '' ) a master equation of lindblad type is usually derived assuming that the joint state of system plus environment to the lowest order in the interaction remains a product state  @xcite : one substitutes @xmath78 in the perturbative evolution equation .",
    "the severity of this approximation is apparently manifested in the fact that entanglement builds up very slowly compared to the time scale given by decoherence .",
    "all pure qubit initial states different from @xmath79 and @xmath80 will lead to system - environment entanglement immediately .",
    "however , as we have shown in the previous section even a slight reduction of purity ( e.g. @xmath72 ) may lead to a prolonged period of separability , long enough for the qubit to loose its coherence .",

    "our separability  ( [ equ : condition - sep ] ) and entanglement  ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) criteria are quite good : the `` unknown territory '' of correlations is very small . to also estimate its accuracy for higher temperatures we study entanglement dynamics of the total state in the case of a single mode `` environment '' , where the full dynamics can be accessed numerically .",

    "we are confident that also in the case of larger environments , our entanglement criterion  ( [ equ : condition - ent ] ) is able to very efficiently detect a negative partial transpose .",
    "clearly , it is an interesting and open question , whether the white areas in our @xmath65-diagrams correspond to entangled , bound entangled or separable total states .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics and nature of system - environment correlations of a decohering qubit with arbitrary ( mixed ) initial state coupled to a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "when the reduced dynamics can be described by a markov master equation of lindblad type , we found that for almost all qubit initial states inside the bloch sphere decoherence is complete long before the build - up of any system - reservoir entanglement : the total state is still separable .",
    "by contrast , in the strong coupling regime the correlation dynamics was found to be more complex : dependent on initial state and temperature of the surrounding heat bath , decoherence can occur before or after the qubit is able to entangle with its environment . at very low temperatures we were even able to detect conditions where the total state alternates between separable and entangled domains as a function of time .",
    "finally , we have compared our criterion for system - reservoir entanglement with exact numerical results for the occurrence of a negative partial transpose in the case of a single mode environment and found excellent agreement .",
    "we therefore believe to have found a reliable criterion for system - bath entanglement . clearly , it is desirable to further investigate the nature of system - environment correlations in the white regions in order to cover the whole range of temperatures and times .",
    "moreover , we are confident that our approach may be applied to more general open quantum system dynamics .",
