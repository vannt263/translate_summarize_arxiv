    "graphene has entered the nanoelectronics scenario only recently and it is intensely investigated as one of the most promising candidates to replace silicon as a channel material in nanoscale transistors . even though graphene is a gapless material , a significant energy gap can be opened in different ways , like for example by `` rolling '' it in carbon nanotubes  @xcite or by defining narrow graphene stripes through electron beam lithography  @xcite or chemical reaction  @xcite . however , several unsolved technological problems arise : state of the art technology can not indeed conveniently control the chirality and the nanotube position , as well as define graphene nanoribbons with widths close to 1 - 2 nm with atomically flat edges , in order to obtain a reasonable semiconducting energy gap .",
    "recently , theoretical models  @xcite and experiments  @xcite have shown that bilayer graphene has an energy gap controllable by a vertical electric field .",
    "one could exploit this property to use bilayer graphene as a channel material for fets , defining an energy gap only when really needed , i.e. when the fet must be in the off state .",
    "this capability could open the possibility of patterning a bilayer graphene sheet with lithographic techniques and non prohibitive feature sizes .    in this letter",
    ", we want to assess the possibility of fabricating a tunable - gap bilayer graphene ( bg ) fet with independent gate operation , based on atomistic numerical simulations .",
    "we assume that all the technological challenges associated to the reliable fabrication of bilayer graphene fets can be solved , and evaluate the potential performance of near ideal device structures . in our opinion , this is one of the most powerful uses of computer simulations in guiding and orienting nanoelectronics research .",
    "a semi - analytical model based on the effective mass approximation has been presented in order to compare bilayer against monolayer graphene transistors  @xcite . however , in that work a constant induced energy bandgap is assumed for bilayer graphene , missing the most important material property of the material .    for a physically sound analysis of bg - fets ,",
    "we have developed a code based on the non - equilibrium green s function formalism ( negf ) , with a tight - binding hamiltonian on a @xmath1 orbital basis set in the real space , which has been included in our in - house device simulator nanotcad vides  @xcite .",
    "we will show that bg - fets miss the itrs requirements  @xcite for the @xmath0 ratio ( @xmath2 ) by a large amount , since the induced gap is not sufficient to suppress band - to - band tunneling currents .",
    "our approach is based on the self - consistent solution of the poisson and schrdinger equations within the negf formalism and the ballistic transport assumption , as described in  @xcite .",
    "the considered bilayer graphene hamiltonian is composed by the two single layer graphene hamiltonians , coupled by the @xmath3=0.35  ev hopping parameters in correspondence of overlaying atoms along the @xmath4-direction  @xcite : the elementary cell is depicted in fig .",
    "semi - infinite contacts have been modeled along the @xmath5 direction by means of self - energies , while periodic boundary conditions have been imposed in the @xmath6 direction , with period equal to @xmath7 , where @xmath8  nm is the carbon - carbon bonding distance .",
    "the simulated device is a double - gate bg - fet , whose structure is shown in fig .",
    "we assume metal gates , and a 1.5  nm layer of sio@xmath9 as gate dielectric .",
    "we also assume an air gap of 0.5  nm between the dielectric interface and the position of carbon sites , as evaluated in  @xcite .",
    "the channel is 15  nm long , and the inter - layer distance is 0.35  nm . the source and drain extensions are 10  nm long , and are doped with an equivalent molar fraction of fully ionized donors @xmath10 .",
    "particular attention has to be posed in the computation of the mobile charge .",
    "considering for the sake of simplicity the equilibrium case , the mobile charge on a given site on layer @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) of the bilayer graphene sheet reads @xmath13 \\label{rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the elementary charge , @xmath15 is the intrinsic ( mid - gap ) fermi level , @xmath16 is the fermi - dirac occupation factor , and @xmath17 is the local density of states on layer @xmath11 .    let us stress the fact that , in order to avoid an unphysical antiscreening behavior , it is necessary to include the effect of dielectric polarization along the direction perpendicular to the graphene bilayer , due to the response of valence electrons to the applied field .",
    "we include this effect by introducing a polarization factor @xmath18 defined as @xmath19 de } , \\label{alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the potential difference between the two graphene layers . by using @xmath18 ,",
    "we can write the total charge ( mobile charge , valence band electrons and ions ) on a given site of layers 1 and 2 as @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ \\rho^\\prime_2&=&\\rho_2-q[1 - 2\\alpha(v ) ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , performing the integral from @xmath22 to @xmath15 in ( [ alpha ] ) at each iteration step can be too computationally demanding . to this purpose , we compute the polarization factor as a function of @xmath20 only once , for an infinitely long bg - fet ( solid line in fig .  [ fig1]c ) . as can be seen , @xmath23 can be reasonably approximated by a straight line @xmath24 . in our code , we have used an odd polynomial of 11th order obtained through least mean square fitting ( symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the transfer characteristics for @xmath25 are shown , for different gate configurations .",
    "in particular , in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a the transfer characteristics as a function of the top gate voltage @xmath26 for two bottom gate voltages ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) are shown .",
    "as can be seen , large currents can be obtained above threshold , while the bg - fet shows huge problems to switch off .",
    "even after applying really negative gate voltages , the drain - to - source current decreases only by roughly six times .",
    "the ratio even worsens when @xmath28 , since in this case a larger amount of positive charge is injected in the valence band , due to band - to - band tunneling , which pins the potential along the channel , and further degrades the gate control over the barrier .",
    "such results are close to those obtained in experiments on monolayer graphene devices  @xcite , showing that the tunable gap is too small to effectively suppress band - to - band tunneling in the off state .    in order to increase the vertical electric field between the two layers of graphene",
    ", we have driven the device by imposing a fixed voltage between the two gates @xmath29 .    even in this case ,",
    "device transconductance ( i.e. the slope of the transfer characteristic ) almost remains the same , regardless of the applied @xmath30 .",
    "this can be explained by the large accumulation of positive charge in the channel , caused by band - to - band tunneling in correspondence of the drain  @xcite : this charge screens the vertical electric field , limiting the size of the opened bandgap .    in fig",
    "[ fig3]b , the transmission coefficient as a function of the transversal wave vector @xmath31 is shown for @xmath32 , @xmath25 and @xmath33 , i.e. , close to minimum achievable current , and in correspondence of the band minimum .",
    "different energy intervals are identified with letters and compared to a sketch of the band edge profile in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a as an aid to interpretation . as can be seen , energy intervals tagged as @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to the bandgaps in the channel , source and drain extensions , respectively : the gap is not uniform",
    ", it is maximum in the channel , where it is almost 100 mev .",
    "one can also see the bound states in the valence band in the energy interval @xmath37 and the valence band states in @xmath38 , which are populated by holes for negative voltages , and which eventually pin the potential of the two mono - layers of graphene , i.e. reducing the gate effectiveness in controlling the channel barrier and the bandgap .",
    "band - to - band tunneling can in principle be reduced by engineering the electric field between source and channel . here",
    "we make two attempts , by introducing a lateral spacer on the gate sides of 2.5  nm , and by introducing a linear doping profile degrading to zero in 2.5  nm under the spacer .",
    "both options have a positive but limited effect , as shown in fig . 3c , and do not solve the problem .",
    "we have explored the possibility of realizing fets by exploiting the tunable - gap property of bilayer graphene , through a code based on tight - binding negf device simulations .",
    "aiming at technology foresight , we have considered the overly optimistic case of an ideal structure and of ballistic transport .",
    "our computer simulations show that tuning the gap is not a very promising technique for achieving appropriate switching characteristics of bg - fets , due to the too weak suppression of band - to - band tunneling . a more complete exploration of the design space , in terms of structure and bias ,",
    "would be required to cast a definitive answer , that is beyond the scope of this letter .",
