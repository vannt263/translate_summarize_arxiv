    "in the light of discoveries of last decades like cosmic acceleration , associated with dark energy `` , or more definitive indications of the existence of dark matter '' , einstein s classical general relativity has occurred again on the firing line \" , to use cliff will s metaphor from the october 1972 issue of physics today",
    ". numerous modifications of einstein s theory assume the existence of scalar field(s ) .",
    "scalar fields are part of the inflationary paradigm and appear conspicuously in string theory and supergravity .",
    "the reality of a fundamental scalar field appears to be supported by the discovery of the brout - englert - higgs boson .",
    "the interest on the interaction of scalar fields and gravity is however older than inflation and supergravity and can be traced back to the well known brans - dicke theory and the black hole no - hair theorems .",
    "the original , and well known , no - hair theorem of bekenstein states that a convex potential is incompatible with the existence of a static black hole in asymptotically flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that massive scalar fields develop a power - law singularity at the horizon when solved in the kerr - newman background @xcite .",
    "bekenstein s theorem was generalized and we understand now that the relevant requirement for an asymptotically flat black hole to exist in the presence of a regular , non - trivial , scalar field profile is the existence of a negative region of the scalar field potential @xcite .",
    "an interest has been revived in black holes in scalar - tensor theories and their perturbations ; for solutions with a real minimally coupled scalar field , see @xcite ; for solutions in theories with non - minimal derivative coupling , see @xcite ; for stability , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , a japanese group studied black hole perturbations in a general gravitational theory with lagrangian given by an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar and the chern - simons pseudoinvariant @xcite .",
    "most recently , the authors associated with this group tackled a technically involved problem of perturbations of black holes in the most general scalar - tensor theory in which all field equations are of the second order .",
    "their lagrangian includes , for example , the brans - dicke theory , @xmath0 gravity , the non - minimal coupling to the gauss - bonnet term , etc .",
    "the odd - parity perturbations have been tackled first @xcite ; most recently , the even - parity sector was also analyzed @xcite .",
    "the authors concentrate primarily on deriving perturbation equations from the second - order actions . in both cases they present general conditions , necessary but not sufficient , for the ( gradient ) stability of a static , spherically symmetric solution .",
    "we remain in the framework of classical four dimensional general relativity and consider perturbations and stability of static , spherically symmetric , planar and hyperbolic hairy black holes in asymptotically flat or asymptotically ( anti- ) de sitter spacetimes in which a scalar field is minimally coupled to gravity ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "then we analyze their odd - parity perturbations following the general treatment of the axial  perturbations of spherically symmetric ( not necessarily vacuum ) spacetimes by chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "we prove the mode stability with respect to general perturbations in the odd - parity sector .",
    "very recently , bhattacharya and maeda @xcite arrived at a conclusion , based on the slow - rotation approximation , that bocharova - bronnikov - melnikov - bekenstein black hole @xcite with a scalar field coupled conformally to gravity can not rotate ( for related discussions se also @xcite ) .",
    "we provide examples when the rotation of a general class of hairy black holes is admissible .",
    "although in the odd - parity case , the gravitational perturbations are fully decoupled from the scalar field perturbations , they can strongly be influenced by the background scalar field .",
    "the situation resembles general perturbations of charged ( reissner - nordstrm ) black holes where the background electric field influences gravitational perturbations ( cf .",
    "the right - hand side of einstein s equations is given in terms of the energy - momentum tensor of ( possibly strong ) background scalar field and odd - parity perturbations of the metric .",
    "as a consequence , the metric component like @xmath1 , which implies the dragging of inertial frames outside a rotating black hole , depends on the character of the background scalar field .",
    "we illustrate this effect .",
    "rotating black holes and boson stars are known to exist when a complex scalar field is minimally coupled to einstein theory @xcite .",
    "however , much less is known when the scalar field is real . to construct the slowly rotating solutions",
    "it is necessary to specify the background .",
    "thus , we use the static black hole family originally found in @xcite .",
    "this family of solutions is the most general four dimensional hairy black hole family with a single real scalar field and contains all other exact black holes available in the literature .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows . in the second section we present the proof that for minimally coupled scalar fields with arbitrary self - interaction , the spectrum of the generalized regge - wheeler equation is always positive .",
    "the proof is done in detail for spherical geometries and generalized to planar trasnversal geometries .",
    "the third section introduces the perturbative frame - dragging computation for the hairy black hole .",
    "we briefly describe the hairy black hole geometries before comparing the frame draging effect with the kerr black hole .",
    "finally we present a discussion of our main results .",
    "our conventions are such that the riemann tensor and the ricci scalar of a sphere are positive in an orthonormal basis .",
    "the metric signature is @xmath2 and we set @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "here we follow closely @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a minimally coupled real scalar field with an arbitrary potential , @xmath5 .",

    "the scalar field is taken to be of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the background field .",
    "the metric perturbations @xmath21 are all taken to be first order in @xmath22 . since any surface of constant @xmath23 is of constant curvature , we consider only axisymmetric perturbations , without any loss of generality ( for more details of the spherically symmetric case , see @xcite ) .",
    "the einstein field equations are truncated at first order in @xmath22 .",
    "this yields the vanishing of @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , using the notation introduced in equation ( [ efeq ] ) and the zeroth - order ( background )  equations we find that @xmath25 where @xmath26 arises from the expansion of the scalar field potential around the background configuration , @xmath27 equations ( [ oddscalar1])-([oddscalar3 ] ) imply that @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "the master variable in this case is @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "inserting all this information in equation ( [ eq ] ) yields the master equation @xmath49 the mode stability can be studied using the fourier decomposition of the master variable , @xmath50 , which yields @xmath51 the scalar field perturbation vanishes , however equation ( [ rw ] ) depends on the background scalar field through its influence on the background metric . in vacuum , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and equation ( [ rw ] ) becomes the regge - wheeler equation .",

    "it follows that all the spherically symmetric four dimensional hairy configurations are mode stable under odd - parity perturbations . to reach this conclusion",
    "it is necessary that @xmath62 which requires that the perturbation vanishes at the horizon .",
    "this is not a very strong requirement , as follow from @xcite ; linear stability under the boundary condition @xmath63 at the horizon implies stability under boundary conditions with @xmath64 taking a finite value at the horizon .",
    "note that @xmath65  goes into the perturbation equation ( [ rw ] ) only through @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath67 the requirement that the perturbations are everywhere well defined is satisfied only if @xmath68 which implies @xmath69 .",
    "the equation for the angular part is just the equation for the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath70 . when @xmath71 further analysis is required .",

    "yields @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are two integration constants . to warm up ,",
    "let us consider now the case of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we have @xmath77 and @xmath78 so it follows that @xmath79 hence , choosing @xmath80 and @xmath81 we find that the perturbed metric is the schwarzschild metric plus the perturbation @xmath82 which , when terms proportional to @xmath83 are neglected , coincides exactly with the kerr metric in the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "now let us consider the hairy black hole family @xcite .",
    "the following configurations are exact background solutions of the einstein equations ( [ efeq ] ) : @xmath84   \\text { , } \\label{s1}\\ ] ] @xmath85 @xmath86 with energy - momentum tensor given by equation ( [ 2 ] ) , scalar field potential and background scalar field by : @xmath87 \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\frac{\\left (   \\nu^{2}-4\\right )   } { 2\\kappa l^{2}\\nu^{2}}\\left [   \\frac { \\nu-1}{\\nu+2}\\exp(-\\phi l_{\\nu}\\left (   \\nu+1\\right )   ) + \\frac{\\nu+1}{\\nu -2}\\exp(\\phi l_{\\nu}\\left (   \\nu-1\\right )   ) + 4\\frac{\\nu^{2}-1}{\\nu^{2}-4}\\exp(-\\phi l_{\\nu})\\right ]   \\text { , } \\label{w}\\ ] ] and @xmath88 where parameter @xmath89 is the unique integration constant ; it arises in a non - standard form which allows to write the solution in terms of a dimensionless radial coordinate @xmath90 and @xmath91the metric and the potential are invariant under the change @xmath92 , therefore , it is possible to take @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that the asymptotic region is at @xmath94 which can be seen from the pole of order two in @xmath95 .",
    "there are two solutions , depending on whether the scalar field is negative , @xmath96 or positive , @xmath97 which allows to cover all the values of the scalar field potential .",
    "the metric is regular for any value of @xmath98 and @xmath99 as can be seen from the introduction of advanced and retarded coordinates , @xmath100 . the scalar field and the geometries are singular at @xmath101 and @xmath102 but these singularities can be covered by event horizons .",
    "the metric reduces to the schwarzschild-(a)ds solution in schwarzschild - droste coordinates when @xmath103 and setting @xmath104 .",
    "the mass of the spherically symmetric solution , computed with the hamiltonian method @xcite , yields@xmath105 where the @xmath106 depends on whether one is considering the branch where @xmath107 or @xmath108 .    in analogy with the kerr solution ,",
    "the slowly rotating hairy black hole is a deformation of the static one plus @xmath109 the metric component @xmath110 determines the frame dragging potential ( see e.g. @xcite ex .",
    "we find that @xmath111 requiring that @xmath112 fixes @xmath113 up to an overall multiplicative constant , @xmath114    to measure the deviation from the slowly rotating kerr solution we plot the ratio @xmath115 versus the square root of the areal function @xmath116 .",
    "the integration constant @xmath89 has units of inverse of length squared .",
    "hence the @xmath90-axis is measured in units of @xmath117 ( e.g. km , parsec , etc . ) . in figure 1",
    "it can be seen that there is a smooth departure from the kerr frame dragging as both coincide when @xmath118 approaches 1 as well as asymptotically for large @xmath116 .",
    "it should be noticed that the departure from kerr can be important and that the horizon can be located at any point in the graph .",
    "indeed , the location of the horizon is defined by the equation @xmath119 , which has solution for any @xmath120 by adjusting the value of @xmath121 in expression ( [ s2 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we addressed the issue of odd - mode stability in a rather general class of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "we proved that for a minimally - coupled real scalar field , independently of its self - interaction and of the asymptotic properties of the spacetime ( asymptotically flat , de sitter or anti - de sitter ) , any static soliton or black hole solution is mode stable under these perturbations .",
    "the situation is such that the scalar field only contributes through the backreaction of the background solution and the dynamics is dictated by the linearized einstein equations .",
    "this is in contrast of what happens with the spherically symmetric mode where the only propagating mode is the scalar one @xcite .",
    "the linearized einstein - scalar field equations allowed us to study the existence of slowly rotating hairy black hole solutions . using the hairy black hole family @xcite ,",
    "we have shown that there is no obstruction for the existence of rotating hairy black holes and that they can have a behavior that strongly departs from the kerr solution .",
    "indeed , it would be very interesting to study the even modes outside the spherically symmetric regime , namely when the scalar and the tensor perturbations interact non - trivially .",
