    "interestingly , the bounds obtained by the no - signaling constraint are the same as those obtained using purely quantum mechanical methods . for example",
    ", there is optimal quantum cloning @xcite , optimal unambiguous state discrimination @xcite , minimal error state discrimination @xcite , and maximum confidence state discrimination @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to add one to the list .",
    "the topic of this study is the optimal state estimation for a single quantum bit ( qubit ) .",
    "massar and popescu @xcite reported that the maximum average fidelity for a single qubit estimation is @xmath0 . using only spatial symmetry , on the other hand",
    ", han @xcite suggested a way to derive optimal quantum direction transfer @xcite , which is the same as the state estimation problem , for the case of a single qubit .",

    "moreover , the results show that , for any figure of merit , the guessing - probability ( distributions ) has the same form , @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 are constants and @xmath3 is the angle between the bloch vector of the prepared qubit and that of the guessed one .",

    "@xcite that the optimal measurements are the same for any figure of merit .",
    "first the procedures of a quantum state estimation are described more precisely .",
    "a player , alice , randomly chooses a direction in three - dimensional space .",
    "that is , she chooses a unit vector @xmath4 with an isotropic probability distribution .",
    "then she prepares a qubit in the pure state with its bloch vector @xmath4 ; namely , @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are pauli operators .",

    "physically , @xmath11 corresponds to the stern - gerlach measurement in the @xmath10 direction if the qubit is in the spin of a particle .",
    "next , if the measurement outcome is @xmath14 [ @xmath15 , he estimates that alice has sent a qubit in the @xmath14 [ @xmath15 state . consider the guessing - probability @xmath16 . here , @xmath17 is the probability that an outcome @xmath18 with a unit vector @xmath19 around @xmath20 within a solid angle @xmath21 is obtained for an input qubit @xmath9 .",

    "consider bob s bloch vector , @xmath34 . then consider a different decomposition of @xmath35 ; @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 , and @xmath38 this means that @xmath39 however , according to the gisin - hughston - jozsa - wootters theorem @xcite , alice can generate any decomposition of bob s mixture by measuring her qubit on an appropriate basis . therefore , in this case , either decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) or that of eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) can be generated by alice .",
    "this suggests that the entangled state can be written as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is another orthogonal basis .",

    "( [ d ] ) ] is then generated at bob s site .",
    "bob can read the message by discriminating the two decompositions .    now let us show that the guessing probability has a unique form using the no - signaling principle . as described above , in the quantum state estimation",
    ", bob s task is to estimate the input with maximal figure of merit , on average .",
    "he is allowed to use all possible means including classical and quantum computers , and even humans .",
    "consider a `` black - box '' , a `` ( quantum ) state estimator , '' which includes everything needed for the estimation inside .",
    "for an input @xmath9 , the quantum - state estimator just gives an outcome , which is its optimal guess , @xmath20 .",
    "faster - than - light communication is possible unless the guessing - probability @xmath16 is in a form @xmath45 , where @xmath3 is angle between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "because the two decompositions can not be discriminated , it must be @xmath48 for all directions @xmath20 .    at this stage",
    ", it is assumed that the estimator is isotropic ; that is , the guessing probability @xmath16 depends dependent only on the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath4 .    to obtain the functional form of @xmath49 most simply , we consider the @xmath50 case @xmath51    if eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) is not satisfied , bob can discriminate the two decompositions by only observing how frequently the state estimator gives the outcome @xmath46 .",
    "more precisely , bob counts the frequency that the state estimator gives the outcomes @xmath18 with unit vector @xmath19 around @xmath46 within the solid angle @xmath21 . in the case of the decomposition of eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , we can see that the frequency is @xmath52 . in the case of the decomposition of eq.([d ] ) , the frequency is @xmath53 .",

    "( [ c-2 ] ) , ( [ f ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , and setting @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we obtain @xmath57 where @xmath3 is the angle between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "can be generalized for any direction @xmath20 and @xmath47 : @xmath61    now , it is easy to show that this functional form generally satisfies eq.([f2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the general form of the guessing probability for state @xmath62 can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath3 is the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath47 .",
    "interestingly , the guessing - probability has a unique form regardless of the figure of merit .",
    "if there is only a single guessing - probability , there is nothing to optimize .",
    "however , there are still infinitely many guessing - probabilities depending on the constants , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". therefore , it should be optimized .",
    "when the figure of merit is fidelity , it is easy to see that it is optimized when @xmath64 , obtaining @xmath65 .",

    "we recover eq .",
    "( [ a-2 ] ) after normalization . when the figure of merit is the information gain , it is optimized when either @xmath64 or @xmath66 .",
    "the guessing probability in the former case is the same as the one when the figure of merit is fidelity .",
    "therefore , the optimal measurements are the same in this case .",
    "however , the guessing probability in the latter case is reversed .",
    "however , the reversed case can be realized by the state estimator used in the former case .",
    "that is , @xmath67 is adopted as the true outcome when an outcome @xmath4 is given .",
    "hence , in the latter case , the optimal measurement is the same .",
    "it can be expected that the optimal guessing probability is the same for other figure of merits .",
    "almost all figures of merit have a property that the figure of merit increases with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "provided the property is satisfied , the optimal guessing probability can be obtained when @xmath64 .",
    "if the guessing probability is the same , the optimal measurement would also be the same .",
    "a simple derivation of the optimal quantum state estimation of a qubit was obtained using the no - signaling principle . in particular , the no - signaling principle determines a unique form of the guessing probability , independent of figures of merit , such as the fidelity or information gain . an optimal guessing probability with the unique form",
    "can be realized using a simple actual measurement strategy .",
    "this proves that the optimal estimation for a qubit can be achieved by the same measurement for all figures of merit , provided the figure of merit satisfies the property that the figure of merit increases with decreasing @xmath3 .",
