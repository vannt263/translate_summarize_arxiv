    "recently the exclusive production of @xmath0 meson in proton - proton collisions was intensively studied close to its production threshold at the cosy ring at kfa jlich @xcite and at saclay @xcite . here",
    "the dominant production mechanism is exchange of several mesons ( so - called meson exchange currents ) and reaction via @xmath8 resonance @xcite .",
    "i present results of a recent study @xcite ( done in collaboration with r. pasechnik and o. teryaev ) of the same exclusive channel but at much larger energies ( @xmath9 10 gev ) . here",
    "diffractive mechanism may be expected to be the dominant process . in ref.@xcite",
    "the regge - inspired pomeron - pomeron fusion was considered as the dominant mechanism of the @xmath0 production . here",
    "i present results obtained in the formalism with unintegrated gluon distribution functions .",
    "similar formalism was used recently to calculate cross section for exclusive higgs boson production @xcite .",
    "there is a chance that the formalism used for higgs can be tested quantitatively for exclusive ( heavy ) meson production where the corresponding cross section is expected to be much bigger .    in fig.[fig :",

    "the kinematical variables are shown in addition.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "following the formalism for the diffractive double - elastic production of the higgs boson developed by kaidalov , khoze , martin and ryskin @xcite ( kkmr ) we write the bare qcd amplitude for the process sketched in fig.1 as @xmath10 the bare amplitude above is subjected to absorption corrections which depend on collision energy .",
    "the vertex function @xmath11 in the expression ( [ main_formula ] ) describes the coupling of two virtual gluons to the pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the details concerning the function @xmath12 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the objects @xmath13 and @xmath14 appearing in formula ( [ main_formula ] ) are skewed ( or off - diagonal ) unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "they are non - diagonal both in @xmath15 and @xmath16 space .",
    "usual off - diagonal gluon distributions are non - diagonal only in @xmath15 . in the limit @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 they become usual ugdfs . in the general case",
    "we do not know off - diagonal ugdfs very well .",
    "it seems reasonable , at least in the first approximation , to take @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are usual dirac isoscalar nucleon form factors and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are total four - momentum transfers in the first and second proton line , respectively .",
    "the above prescription is a bit arbitrary .",
    "it provides , however , an interpolation between different @xmath15 and @xmath23 values .    neglecting spin - flipping contributions the average matrix element squared for the @xmath24 process",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath25",
    "we have shown in ref.@xcite that it is very difficult to describe the only exsisting high - energy ( w @xmath26 30 gev ) data measured by the wa102 collaboration @xcite in terms of the unintegrated gluon distributions .",
    "first of all , rather large cross section has been measured experimentally .",
    "using prescription ( [ skewed_ugdfs ] ) and on - diagonal ugdfs from the literature we get much smaller cross sections .",
    "secondly , the calculated dependence on the azimuthal angle between the outgoing protons is highly distorted from the @xmath27 distribution , whereas the measured one is almost a perfect @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this signals that a rather different mechanism plays the dominant role at this energy .",
    "@xmath28 as a function of center of mass energy for different ugdfs .",
    "the @xmath29 fusion contribution is shown by the dash - dotted ( red ) line .",
    "the world experimental data are shown for reference.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in fig.[fig : sig_tot_w ] i show energy dependence of the total ( integrated over kinematical variables ) cross section for the exclusive reaction @xmath30 for different ugdfs .",
    "quite different results are obtained for different ugdfs .",
    "this demonstrates huge sensitivity to the choice of ugdf .",
    "the cross section with the kharzeev - levin type distribution ( based on the idea of gluon saturation ) gives the cross section which is small and almost idependent of beam energy .",
    "in contrast , the bfkl distribution leads to strong energy dependence .",
    "the sensitivity to the transverse momenta of initial gluons can be seen by comparison of the two solid lines calculated with the gaussian ugdf with different smearing parameter @xmath31 = 0.2 and 0.5 gev .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath29 fusion mechanism ( red dash - dotted line ) is fairly small and only slowly energy dependent .",
    "while the qed contribution can be reliably calculated , the qcd contribution can not be at present fully controlled .",
    "=    =    in fig.[fig : map_t1t2 ] i present two - dimensional maps @xmath32 of the cross section for the qcd mechanism ( kl ugdf ) and the qed mechanism ( dirac terms only ) for the tevatron energy w = 1960 gev . if @xmath33 0.5 gev@xmath34 the qed mechanism is clearly negligible .",
    "however , at @xmath35 0.2 gev@xmath34 the qed mechanism may become equally important or even dominant .",
    "in addition , it may interfere with the qcd mechanism .    in table  1",
    "i have collected cross sections ( in nb ) for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons for w = 1960 gev , integrated over broad range of kinematical variables specified in the table caption .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath1 are very similar to corresponding cross sections for @xmath0 production and in some cases even bigger .",

    "no absorption corrections were included . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the existing models of ugdfs predict cross section much smaller than the one obtained by the wa102 collaboration at the center - of - mass energy w = 29.1 gev .",
    "this may signal presence of subleading reggeons at this `` low '' energy .",
    "finally we have presented results for exclusive double elastic @xmath1 production .",
    "similar cross sections as for @xmath0 production were obtained .",
    "also in this case the results depend strongly on the choice of ugdf",
    ".    measurements of the reaction(s ) in the title would help to limit or even pin down the ugdfs in the nonperturbative region of small gluon transverse momenta where these objects can not be obtained as a solution of any perturbative evolution equation , but must be rather modelled .",
