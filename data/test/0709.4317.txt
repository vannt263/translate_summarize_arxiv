    "quantum dots , their current and noise properties @xcite are widely investigated topics in today s nanophysics with a number of possible applications , the most revolutionary being a spin - based quantum computer @xcite . here",
    ", the spin of an electron in a quantum dot is used as a qubit , which serves as the basic building block of a quantum computer . a necessary ingredient for quantum processing",
    "is the possibility to couple at least two qubits and to understand and manipulate the various correlations .",
    "this is one of the motivations to study double quantum dots @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is required to create entangled electron states by the interaction of an electron inside the double dot with an electron tunneling onto the double dot . measuring this entanglement is an important experimental task and theoretical suggestions how to probe",
    "these states are needed .    in this work",
    ", we will discuss the relation between zero - frequency current noise , coulomb correlations , and entanglement for the example of a double quantum dot .",
    "we will make use of the recent observation @xcite that noise measurements in the nonlinear coulomb - blockade regime can be used to obtain spectroscopic information of excited levels in a quantum dot .",
    "this scheme will be adapted to a double quantum dot and we will show that the important interaction parameter @xmath0 ( containing information about the entanglement )  @xcite enters the fano factor ( i.e. , the ratio of noise power to current ) in this regime .",
    "this kind of noise spectroscopy can be used to directly extract @xmath0 from experimentally observable quantities .",
    "we extend a previous discussion @xcite of the low - frequency shot noise of a double - dot system by an analysis of the full counting statistics of the transferred charge .",
    "this allows us to identify directly the interaction parameter by a noise measurement .",
    "one main result is obtained in the transport regime , in which predominantly only one electron occupies the lowest double dot level due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "thermal activation leads to tunneling events through excited two - electron states which result ( under the conditions discussed below ) in super - poissonian shot noise characterized by a fano factor @xmath1 hence , a measurement of the noise in this regime allows a direct determination of the interaction parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we now turn to a description of the model and the method . with",
    "maximally two electrons occupying the double dot and no magnetic field lifting the spin - degeneracy , the following hund - mulliken eigenstates of the double quantum dot are possible ( for a more detailed description see @xcite ) : the zero - electron state @xmath2 , two two - fold degenerate one - electron states @xmath3 ( symmetric ) and @xmath4 ( anti - symmetric ) , four two - electron states with one electron per dot , the singlet @xmath5 and the three - fold degenerate triplet @xmath6 .",
    "there are two other singlet states that have a significantly higher energy due to the large on - site coulomb interaction which do not have a physical effect in the regime studied ( but are included in the numerical calculations ) .",
    "we consider a ( longitudinal ) double dot coupled to leads , which are modeled as a fermi sea .",
    "the tunnel coupling leads to a tunneling amplitude @xmath7 , which measures the overlap between the orbital state and the lead wave function in terminal @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is the applied bias voltage and that @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the chemical potentials of the left and right leads .",
    "there is an additional lead with capacitive coupling to the double dot characterized by the gate voltage @xmath12 that shifts the potential on the dot .",
    "when one electron is on the dot , it can be in two possible states : its wave function is spread either symmetrically or anti - symmetrically over the two dots .",
    "the symmetric state has a lower eigenenergy , and the energy difference between the two one - electron states depends on the interdot tunneling amplitude @xmath13 , describing the potential barrier between the two dots . including the energy contribution of the gate voltage , the eigenenergies of these states can be calculated as @xmath14 .",
    "adding a second electron , we have first to overcome the gate voltage again , and additionally the repulsive coulomb interaction between the two electrons leads to a spin - dependent splitting of the eigenenergies . for the singlet state @xmath5 we obtain the energy @xmath15 , and for the ( three - fold degenerate )",
    "triplet state @xmath16 the energy @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the ( inter - dot ) electron - electron repulsion and @xmath19 is the heisenberg exchange parameter that characterizes the heisenberg interaction between the two spins , @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the on - site coulomb repulsion . because @xmath22 is positive",
    ", the singlet state has a lower energy than the triplet state .",
    "the singlet state can be expressed in terms of the creation operators @xmath23 , @xmath24 , which create an ( anti)-symmetric electron state @xmath25 the interaction parameter @xmath0 describes the competition between the kinetic - energy gain and the coulomb repulsion . in the hund - mulliken model @xmath26",
    "is determined by the inter - dot tunneling amplitude @xmath13 and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath21 @xcite . in general",
    ", the dependence of @xmath0 on the microscopic parameters may have a different form , however we will always use this definition for the quantitative plots below .",
    "it is important to stress that the results obtained below are largely independent on the precise dependence of @xmath0 on the details of the quantum dot .",
    "hence , the noise features we find can be used as an additional test of the applicability of the model calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to realistic quantum dots .",
    "we describe transport through the double dot in the sequential - tunneling approximation using the master equation @xmath27 here , @xmath28 and @xmath29 label the available states of the quantum dot , including the number of electrons on the dot , the orbital index , and the spin .",
    "@xmath30 is the occupation probability of state @xmath28 , and @xmath31 is the tunneling rate from state @xmath28 to state @xmath29 .",
    "the rates are given by @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the bare tunneling rate to the left ( right ) terminal , and @xmath34 is the density of states in the leads .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath35 depend on the orbital and the spin state of the dot @xcite .",
    "the occupation in the leads is determined by the fermi functions @xmath36 $ ] , the direction of tunneling is defined by @xmath37 and the energy difference by @xmath38 .",
    "we note here , that the interaction parameter @xmath0 enters the calculations through the matrix elements @xmath35 of the singlet state . for a more detailed discussion of these tunneling rates",
    "we refer to @xcite . for later use",
    "we express the master equation  ( [ emasteq ] ) in matrix form , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    from the master equation , we obtain the noise @xcite .",
    "the quantity characterizing the current noise is the fano factor @xmath43 .",
    "it measures , how far the distribution of the tunneling events differ from the random , poissonian distribution : for poissonian noise , when the tunneling events are uncorrelated , @xmath44 .",
    "a fano factor @xmath45 can be due to anti - correlations ( e.g. the pauli principle )",
    ". we will be mostly interested below in super - poissonian noise , @xmath46 , and we will show that here it is due to correlated transport cycles resulting from a blockade of open channels . by a transport cycle",
    "we mean the following process @xcite : suppose the system is initially in its ground state @xmath47 , and another state @xmath48 ( which would be available for tunneling according to its energy ) is blocked due to coulomb interaction .",
    "when this electron in @xmath47 tunnels out of the dot due to a thermal excitation , both the states @xmath47 and @xmath48 are available for electrons to tunnel into .",
    "a cycle is occurring , when a sequence of electrons tunnels through state @xmath48 before an electron enters the ground state @xmath47 and blocks the transport through the dot again .",
    "this cycle leads to a correlated transfer of a number of charges given by the number electrons tunneling through the excited state @xmath48 .",
    "hence , that effective charge transferred in one cycle is larger than one and leads to an increased fano factor .",
    "the above picture is based on the sequential - tunneling approximation .",
    "the parameters have to be chosen such that cotunneling processes can be neglected .",
    "this is experimentally possible , since the current due to cotunneling processes is generally of the order of @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the tunneling amplitude and @xmath51 is the excitation energy in the virtual intermediate state . in our case",
    "the current in the most interesting regime is proportional to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is exponentially small in @xmath54 .",
    "since the tunneling amplitude @xmath50 can in principle be made arbitrarily small , sequential tunneling becomes the dominant process .",
    "recently it was shown that noise spectroscopy deep inside the coulomb blockade regime is possible @xcite and in agreement with the sequential - tunneling description .",
    "the results of our calculation are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fbloccurfan ] , which shows the average current ( top panel ) and the fano factor ( bottom panel ) as a function of the bias voltage @xmath9 and the gate voltage @xmath12 . considering the current , the most visible feature is the coulomb blockade diamond ( green in fig .",
    "[ fbloccurfan ] ) . as long as the bias voltage is lower than the energy difference between the energetically lowest state and the next state with one electron more or less ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath55 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being two states differing by one electron , electron tunneling is exponentially suppressed . in our model",
    ", we have three such blockade regimes with 0 , 1 , and 2 electrons in the dot for zero bias voltage .",
    "the two parts of fig .",
    "[ fbloccurfan ] show the current and the fano factor for the most interesting of these blockade regions , the one - electron blockade regime .",
    "we will concentrate our discussion on this region , since most interesting features can be discussed here .",
    "we first look at the energies of the states in the blockade regime as a function of the gate voltage , see fig .",
    "[ fenplot ] .",
    "the capital letters in figs .",
    "[ fbloccurfan ] and  [ fenplot ] correspond to these blockade regions , and we will now show that the features in the fano factor can be explained by the energy plot for the states in this region .",
    "we first consider the regions @xmath47 .",
    "they are both characterized by a fano factor @xmath44 , typical tunneling processes through a simple two - level system .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fenplot ] shows that the first excited states differ in electron number . in @xmath56 the excited state",
    "is @xmath2 and in @xmath57 @xmath5 .",
    "lowering the gate voltage , we come to region @xmath48 , where the first excited state is the state @xmath4 , i.e. , a state with one electron as well . thus , the description in terms of a single state , which can be occupied or not , does not hold any more , and we observe an increase in the fano factor to @xmath58 . in this region ,",
    "the state @xmath2 is still the first state available for tunneling , but the blocked state @xmath4 is energetically lower . continuing to region @xmath59 ,",
    "in which the energies of the two - electron states become lower than the zero - electron state .",
    "so the first available excited state is the singlet @xmath5 .",
    "the difference between the regions @xmath59 and @xmath60 is somewhat more complicated .",
    "since the difference @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath62 , the state @xmath3 still blocks the dot , if it is occupied . after a thermal excitation to the state @xmath5 ,",
    "electrons tunnel through the states @xmath5 and @xmath4 until an electron occupies the state @xmath3 again and blocks the dot . in the regions @xmath59 and @xmath60 the fano factor depends on the parameter @xmath0 through the prefactor of the singlet states ( see eq .  ) .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fphidep ] by varying the parameter @xmath63 .",
    "as can be seen the positions of the steps change simultaneously with the plateau height .",
    "however , the height depends only on the interaction parameter , as we have checked by numerically varying @xmath21 and @xmath0 independently .",
    "we will derive below analytic expressions for the fano factor , which confirm this behavior .",
    "the effect of temperature will be to wash out the sharp steps and plateaus .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp ] .",
    "increasing the temperature to a value of the order of the level splitting first the sharp steps are washed out .",
    "the plateaus c and d , however , remains still visible and the values are still given , at least approximately , by the low temperature results .",
    "finally , the temperature leads to a vanishing of the plateaus , which make it difficult to extract the interaction parameter @xmath0 from the fano factor .",
    "a more detailed view of the transport characteristic can be obtained by looking at the full counting statistics ( fcs ) @xcite .",
    "the aim is here to find the cumulant generating function ( cgf ) @xmath64 , which is related to the probability @xmath65 of @xmath66 charges passing through the system during the measurement time @xmath67 by @xmath68 .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath64 is equivalent to the knowledge of all the cumulants of the system according to @xmath69 , such as current ( first cumulant ) and noise ( second cumulant ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively ( where @xmath72 is the electron charge ) .",
    "the simplest way to evaluate the counting statistics in this case is to use the method described in ref .  .",
    "we choose ( without loss of generality ) to count the charges in the left lead .",
    "therefore , we have to change the left tunneling rates in the off - diagonal elements of the transport matrix @xmath73 : @xmath74 .",
    "the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath73 , which we denote by @xmath75 , determines the cgf as @xmath76 .",
    "if we restrict our calculations to a certain region and thus reduce the number of involved states , it is possible to get an analytical expression for the fano factor @xcite . for region @xmath59 , we include the one - electron states @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and the two - electron singlet @xmath5 . here , the relevant energy differences are both smaller than the bias : @xmath77 .",
    "therefore both fermi functions for the tunneling processes are exponentially suppressed , but one is much bigger than the other : @xmath78 therefore , we neglect @xmath79 and take the rates to lowest order in the parameter @xmath80 . then the tunneling rates are @xmath81 here , @xmath82 are the bare tunneling rates for the left / right leads . without loss of generality , we will count the charges in the left lead , which means , we have to replace @xmath83 ( the sign depending on whether an electron enters or leaves the dot respectively ) in the off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath73 .",
    "the counting statistics is obtained from the smallest eigenvalue @xmath84 , which we determine to lowest order in @xmath53 .",
    "the result is @xmath85 where @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "finally we obtain the fano factor @xmath87 which is independent of the bias voltage as long as we are in the one - electron coulomb blockade regime . for a symmetric structure with @xmath88",
    "we obtain eq .",
    "( [ efanc ] ) .    a similar result may be obtained for the region @xmath60 in fig .",
    "[ fbloccurfan ] . here",
    ", the situation is a bit more complicated , since the lowest - lying triplet state also plays a role and , thus , the problem involves four states . in the same way as before we neglect @xmath89",
    "since the transition between @xmath90 is the least suppressed .",
    "assuming that the temperature is much smaller than the singlet - triplet splitting , we calculate the series expansion for the fano factor ( with symmetric leads ) to be @xmath91 both these results , eqs .",
    "( [ efanc ] ) and ( [ efand ] ) , are in agreement with our numerical calculations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fphidep ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that noise measurements in the coulomb blockade regime of a double quantum dot can reveal interesting information about the quantum correlations created during tunneling .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the fano factor in the one - electron blockade region is super - poissonian and can be used to determine the interaction parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this allows to measure the degree of entanglement of two electrons in the double quantum dot .",
