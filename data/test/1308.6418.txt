    "heavy - ion reactions around the coulomb barrier often show a behavior that can not be accounted for by a simple potential model  @xcite . they have thus provided a good opportunity to investigate the role of internal degrees of freedom in the reaction process .",
    "one of the well known examples is a large enhancement of sub - barrier fusion cross sections due to the couplings between the relative motion of the projectile and target nuclei and their internal degrees of freedom , such as surface vibrations for spherical nuclei , or rotational motion for nuclei possessing a static , intrinsic deformation .",
    "it is well recognized that these couplings lead to a distribution of potential barriers  @xcite , and a method was proposed by rowley , satchler and stelson to extract the barrier distributions directly from experimental fusion cross sections  @xcite .",
    "the barrier distributions extracted in this way are found to be sensitive to details of the couplings , often showing a characteristic structured behavior  @xcite .",
    "similar heavy - ion barrier distributions can also be defined for large - angle quasi - elastic scattering  @xcite .    in order to analyze experimental data for these low - energy heavy - ion reactions ,",
    "the coupled - channels method has been employed as a standard approach  @xcite .",
    "this method describes the reaction in terms of the internal excitations of the colliding nuclei , representing the total wave function of the system as a superposition of wave functions for the relevant reaction channels .",
    "conventionally , a few low - lying collective excitations , that are strongly coupled to the ground state , are taken into account in these calculations .",
    "such analyses have successfully accounted for the strong enhancement of sub - barrier fusion cross sections , and have successfully reproduced the structure of the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions for many systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , quasi - elastic barrier distributions have been measured for the @xmath2ne + @xmath3zr systems  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding coupled - channels calculations show that the main structure of these barrier distributions is determined by the rotational excitations of the strongly deformed nucleus @xmath2ne .",
    "the calculated barrier distributions are in fact almost identical for the two systems , even when the collective excitations of the zr isotopes are taken into account .",
    "it was , therefore , surprising when the two experimental barrier distributions were found to be different in an important respect .",
    "that is , the barrier distribution for @xmath2ne + @xmath4zr exhibits a much more smeared behavior than that for the @xmath2ne + @xmath4zr system .",
    "the origin of this difference has been conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite to be the multitude of non - collective excitations of the zr isotopes , that are generally ignored in a coupled - channels analysis .",
    "in fact , the two extra neutrons in the @xmath4zr nucleus lead to a significantly larger number of non - collective excited states compared with @xmath5zr , since this latter possesses an @xmath6 closed shell ( the difference is reflected by the number of known states up to an excitation energy of 5  mev ; one finds 35 for @xmath5zr and 87 for @xmath4zr  @xcite ) .",
    "there are many ways to describe non - collective excitations in heavy - ion reactions @xcite . in the 1970 s , weidenmller _ et al .",
    "_ introduced a random - matrix model for such excitations in order to study deep inelastic collisions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have used a similar model in a schematic one - dimensional barrier - penetration problem , in order to study the role of these non - collective excitations in low - energy reactions . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have explicitly taken into account in the coupled - channels formalism all of the 70 known non - collective states in @xmath1pb below 7.382  mev  @xcite without resorting to the random - matrix model , and have analysed in this way the experimental data for the @xmath0o+@xmath1pb reaction .",
    "although some discrepancies between the experimental and theoretical barrier distributions remain after the inclusion of non - collective excitations , we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that these excitations play a more important role as the incident energy increases .",
    "we have also compared there the role of non - collective excitations in the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions , and have shown that they affect both distributions in a similar fashion .    given that exact calculations with a realistic spectrum for non - collective states is possible here , it is intriguing to also apply the random - matrix model to this system in order to test its applicability .",
    "this theoretical test is the main aim of this paper , and we achieve it by comparing our new results with those obtained in ref .",
    "note that , in contrast to @xmath1pb , the properties of the non - collective states in @xmath3zr are not known sufficiently well .",
    "as we will show in this paper , the random - matrix model provides a good method for a description of non - collective excitations in such a situation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we explain the coupled - channels formalism with non - collective excitations based on the random - matrix model . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the strength distribution and fusion cross sections obtained with this model .",
    "we then compare these with calculations using the more exact couplings and discuss the applicability of the random - matrix model .",
    "the paper is summarised in sec .",
    "in order to describe internal excitations during the reaction process , we assume the following hamiltonian , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the separation of the projectile and target nuclei , and @xmath9 is the reduced mass . in this equation , @xmath10 is the intrinsic hamiltonian with @xmath11 representing a set of internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the optical potential for the relative motion is @xmath12 , and it includes an imaginary part to simulate the fusion process ( that is , strong absorption into compound - nucleus degrees of freedom inside the coulomb barrier ) .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian between the relative motion and the intrinsic degrees of freedom is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "the coupled - channels equations for this hamiltonian are obtained by expanding the total wave function in terms of the eigenfunctions of @xmath10 .",

    "we have employed the iso - centrifugal approximation @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum in the centrifugal potential is replaced by the total angular momentum  @xmath17 , thereby considerably reducing the dimension of the coupled - channels equations .    in solving these equations ,",
