    "microtubules are one class of polymeric filaments in the eucaryotic cell , whose sub - unit is a hetero - dimer of alpha- and beta - tubulin .",
    "microtubules therefore possess structural polarity , and the ends are differentiated as plus and minus ends .",
    "a hall - mark of microtubules is their unique mechanism of assembly and disassembly : a polymerizing microtubule can abruptly start shrinking by losing sub - units and _ vice - versa _ , a process referred to as dynamic instability(reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "the stochastic switching process between growth and shrinkage is referred to as catastrophe and the reverse process is called rescue . between a rescue and a catastrophe , a microtubule grows in length by polymerizing and between a catastrophe and rescue , it shrinks . in vivo , a third state called pause",
    "is also observed where the length remains static .",
    "microtubules usually nucleate from organizing centers called centrosomes , but may also be found free in the cytoplasm .",
    "microtubules play a central role in eukaryotic cell division .",
    "an important milestone in the cell division cycle is the formation of the metaphase spindle , where all the duplicated chromosome pairs , held together by kinetochores are aligned along the cell  equator ( the `` metaphase plate '' ) in such a way that each chromosome of a pair is facing one of the poles of the cell , and attached to one or more microtubules emanating from a centrosome located near that pole .",
    "how is the spindle assembled ?",
    "it is generally believed that microtubules nucleating from each centrosome randomly searches the surrounding space for chromosomes by alternately growing and shrinking ( the random search - and - capture model , and are stabilized upon contact with a kinetochore@xcite , which has also been supported by experimental observations@xcite .",
    "however , investigations over the last decade or so have revealed that the chromosomes do not remain passive in this process ; rather , the kinetochores nucleate and stabilize microtubules in their vicinity , a process facilitated by rangtp , which then connect to the astral microtubules emanating from the chromosomes , assisted by motor proteins such as dyenin ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    theoretical investigation of the random search - and - capture model was done first by holy and leibler@xcite and more recently by wollman et al@xcite .",
    "the latter paper investigated the possible effects of a microtubule - stabilizing rangtp gradient around chromosomes , and concluded that when many chromosomes are involved , the search can not be completed within the observed time - scales without this additional biochemical regulation .",
    "however , both the papers did not discuss the effects of the cell boundary and its constraining effect on the search .",
    "also , the analytical results were restricted to the case where rescue is completely absent .",
    "the present paper complements these earlier investigations into this important problem and extends them in several ways .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the base search - and - capture model ( i.e. , without considering the additional biochemical mechanisms for search ) , and present a complete theoretical solution to the problem of finding the search time for a fixed target by dynamic microtubules .",
    "our approach permits the calculation of a compact mathematical expression in laplace space for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the capture time of a single fixed chromosome by successive microtubules nucleating from a single nucleating site ( one at a time ) , for arbitrary cell size and kinetic parameters .",
    "in particular , we are able to find the search time distribution also for non - zero rescue frequency , unlike the earlier approaches . we investigate the conditions which optimize the search process using this pdf , and conclude that the cell size is an important factor in the optimization process . for small cell sizes , the search time is minimized when both catastrophe and rescue frequencies are small , while for large cells , the rescue frequency need to be close to zero , while the catastrophe frequency need to be around a certain optimal value .",
    "these conclusions are found to be in agreement with available experimental results for various cell types and existing theoretical results where applicable .    in the following sections , we discuss the problem and the model ,",
    "develop the formalism to address the problem , and present our results .",
    "the results are then analyzed in the context of available experimental observations .",
    "we approximate the cell as a sphere of radius r , at the center of which we place a microtubule nucleating center . a single target ( chromosome ) of cross - sectional area",
    "a is placed at a distance d from the center .",
    "this simplified geometry of a mitotic cell permits a complete analytical solution of the problem .",
    "microtubules nucleate from the center at a rate @xmath0 .",
    "catastrophe and rescue frequencies are denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , and are assumed to be the same everywhere inside the cell , as are the growth and shrinkage velocities , denoted @xmath3 and @xmath4 . from the nucleating center , a single microtubule initially nucleates in a random direction and grows by polymerization as long as it is in the growth phase , while the same microtubule shrinks in length by depolymerization in the shrinking phase . in the process",
    ", the microtubule scans the surrounding space for chromosomes , and is stabilized when the growing end encounters a kinetochore .",
    "a microtubule from a certain nucleation site on the centrosome can nucleate in many possible directions ; however , given the finite size of the centrosome , the orientation is likely to be constrained by the geometry of the centrosome . in an extreme case ,",
    "one many imagine that a microtubule will always grow only along the local normal to the surface , but this case is pathological when the target is fixed in space , since no microtubule might ever grow in the right direction to find it .",
    "it is therefore , more realistic to imagine that microtubules from each nucleation site in the centrosome will grow within a certain solid angle @xmath5 , which defines a _ search cone _ for the corresponding nucleation site . in this case , if the fixed target falls inside the cone , and has a cross - sectional area @xmath6 , a microtubule originating at that particular site has a probability    @xmath7    for nucleating in the _ right _ direction , within the search cone .",
    "we now need to determine @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that if there are @xmath8 nucleating sites on the surface of the inner hemisphere of the centrosome , all the microtubules emanating these sites together will be searching a solid angle @xmath9 , without interfering with each other . in this case , we require that @xmath10 , and the inequality allow for some overlap of the search - cones in general . to be specific , we concentrate on the lower limit of @xmath8 , and assume that @xmath11 , which fixes the search - cone angle as above . in assuming that the search is _ distributive _ ,",
    "our model differs from the previous theoretical treatments , where each microtubule in the searching population was assumed to search the entire solid angle of @xmath9 in the surrounding space , which , we feel is an unrealistic assumption",
    ". it must also be added that some amount of overlap between search - cones may be allowed in our model also , but for the time being , we disregard this possibility for the sake of simplicity .        a search by a single microtubule",
    "is terminated in three possible ways : if the nucleation occurs in the right direction , ( i ) the growing tip encounters the target and ends the search , or ( ii ) the microtubule depolymerizes completely before it encounters the target , and finally ( iii ) if the nucleation happens in the wrong direction , the microtubule will ultimately depolymerize and disappear after a futile search , with or without encountering the cell boundary . in the last case",
    ", we assume that once the microtubule hits the cell boundary , it undergoes catastrophe at a rate @xmath12 , which is generally higher than the value in the interior @xcite . in particular , it was reported in @xcite that the catastrophe frequency near the boundary is 16-fold higher than that in the interior , for certain cells . in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) , a new microtubule will nucleate again from the center in a randomly chosen direction , at rate @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 the probability density of the capture time , from which the mean capture time follows :    @xmath14    in the above equation , @xmath15 gives the probability that the search will be eventually successful .",
    "since the basic process under consideration here is the capture of a certain target by one ( or a set ) of dynamically unstable filaments , it is natural to base our theory on consideration of first passage probability densities@xcite .",
    "we define three conditional first passage probability densities ( cfpd ) , which completely describe the search process .",
    "these cfpds are defined below , with their corresponding conditions in italics .    1 .",
    "@xmath16 is the cfpd for a freshly nucleated microtubule to nucleate in the right direction and reach a distance d for the first time after a time interval @xmath17 , _ without ever shrinking back to the origin in between_. 2 .",
    "@xmath18 is the cfpd for shrinking to the origin after a life - time @xmath17 , after nucleating in a wrong direction , _ without ever reaching a length @xmath19 in between_. 3 .",

    "after encounter with the boundary ( and consequent catastrophe ) at least once ( and possibly several times ) in between_.    we now denote by @xmath21 the probability of n unsuccessful nucleation - search - disappearance events within a time interval t , prior to a successful event , so that    @xmath22    let us now assume that among the @xmath23 unsuccessful nucleation events , there are @xmath24 events where the microtubule nucleated in the right direction , but did not reach the chromosome , @xmath25 events where it nucleated in a wrong direction , but shrank back to origin before encountering the boundary , and @xmath26 events where the microtubule nucleated in a wrong direction , encountered the boundary , underwent catastrophe and then shrank to the origin .    in terms of the fpds described above , we find that    @xmath27 } \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 could be @xmath29 , @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",

    "the fpds introduced above are now calculated from the green s functions for mt kinetics , derived explicitly in the next section .",
    "the stochastic state of a mt at a given point in time @xmath39 is characterized by two variables , its length @xmath40 and its state of polymerization versus depolymerization , which we denote by an index @xmath41,which takes one of the two values,1 or 0 respectively for growing and shrinking states . in this case , therefore , we need to compute four green s functions , or propagators , @xmath42 , for @xmath43 ; by definition , @xmath44 gives the probability that a given mt will have length @xmath40 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and will be in state @xmath41 at time @xmath39 , provided that it had a length @xmath47 and was at state @xmath48 at an earlier time @xmath49 .",
    "calculating the above green s functions for a physically realistic situation would also require specification of appropriate boundary conditions at the origin ( nucleating site ) and this has been done earlier@xcite .",
    "however , we deem this unnecessary for our purpose , since we are only interested in using these green s functions to compute the cfpds introduced above",
    ". therefore , for the rest of this paper , we will allow the ` length ' @xmath45 to be a continuously varying variable between positive and negative values , with no boundary condition imposed on the dynamics at @xmath50 .",
    "the boundary conditions are used in the definition of the cfpds later .",

    "this is done by defining    @xmath56    it will be convenient for later calculations to carry out the inversion @xmath57 explicitly :    @xmath58}\\bigg[e^{-\\alpha_s(x - x_0)}\\theta(x - x_0)+e^{\\beta_s(x - x_0)}\\theta(x_0-x)\\bigg]+\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\delta_{1j}}{(\\alpha_s+\\beta_s)}\\bigg[\\alpha_se^{-\\alpha_s(x - x_0)}\\theta(x - x_0)-\\beta_se^{\\beta_s(x - x_0)}\\theta(x_0-x)\\bigg]\\nonumber\\\\ { \\tilde f}_{0j}(x , s;x_0)=\\frac{\\nu_c+s\\delta_{0j}}{v_g[\\alpha_s+\\beta_s]}\\bigg[e^{-\\alpha_s(x - x_0)}\\theta(x - x_0)+e^{\\beta_s(x - x_0)}\\theta(x_0-x)\\bigg]-\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{\\delta_{0j}}{(\\alpha_s+\\beta_s)}\\bigg[\\alpha_se^{-\\alpha_s(x",

    "the green s functions calculated in the last section may now be used to compute the cfpds which we used before . for this purpose , it is convenient to define first a set of _ unconditional _ first passage densities ( denoted fpd ) as follows : let @xmath63 denote the probability , per unit time , for a mt in state @xmath48 and with length @xmath47 at time @xmath49 , to reach a length @xmath45 for the first time at time @xmath39 , and in state @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath64 , @xmath65 is given by the implicit equation    @xmath66    in the above equation ( and the following equations ) , the @xmath67-factors take into account the following restriction on its dynamics : starting from a growing state at @xmath49 , with a length @xmath40 , it can return to the same length @xmath40 at a later time , in a growing state , only from below ( which decides which of the @xmath68-functions appearing in eq.[eq10 ] is non - zero ) .",
    "similar restrictions apply to the equations below .",
    "similarly , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are given by the equations    @xmath71    using these two fpds , we are now in a position to write down the following relations between the cfpds introduced earlier :    @xmath72    @xmath73    eq.[eq12]-[eq16 ] may now be solved using laplace transforms . from eq.[eq12 ] , we find that    @xmath74    similarly ,    @xmath75    after solving eq.[eq15 ] and eq.[eq16 ] together , we find the explicit expressions    @xmath76+d(s)}\\nonumber\\\\ { \\tilde q}_d(s)=\\frac{\\nu_c}{\\nu_c+s+\\beta    v_g}\\left[1-e^{-\\beta_sd}{\\tilde \\phi}(d , s)\\right ] \\label{eq19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 is given by    @xmath78      we assume that when a mt hits the cell boundary by growing , it undergoes catastrophe there at a rate @xmath79 .",
    "we now compute @xmath31 , which is the cfpd of return to origin ( i.e. , complete depolymerization ) of a mt after a lifetime @xmath17 , and an encounter with the boundary at least once .",
    "clearly , along the line of our previous arguments , @xmath31 may be given by the expression    @xmath80    where @xmath81 gives the fpd of complete depolymerization of a mt , starting at the boundary , at length @xmath82 in shrinking state , with possibly multiple visits back to the boundary in between .",
    "this quantity may now be expressed implicitly through the equation    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is a ` mirror ' image of @xmath85 introduced earlier , and represents the cpfd of a return to boundary over a time interval @xmath17 , without ever reaching the origin ( i.e. , shrinking to zero ) in between .",
    "similarly , @xmath86 is the ` inverse ' of @xmath87 , and gives the cfpd of complete depolymerization of a mt starting at the boundary , without ever returning to the boundary in between .",
    "eq.[eq21 ] and eq.[eq22 ] may now be solved together using laplace transforms , and we find    @xmath88    @xmath89 and @xmath90 may be obtained from @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively by the transformations @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( and _ vice - versa _ ) . from eq.[eq11 ] , this has the effect of replacing @xmath95 by @xmath96 and _ vice - versa _ , while @xmath77 defined in eq.[eq20 ] remains invariant under these transformations . therefore ,",
    "using eq.[eq19 ] , we arrive at the following expressions for these ` inverse ' quantities :    @xmath97\\\\ { \\tilde    \\phi^*}(r , s)=\\frac{d(s)e^{-\\beta_sr}}{\\nu_r\\nu_c[1-e^{-(\\alpha_s+\\beta_s)r}]+d(s ) } \\label{eq24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the mean time of capture of the target is now evaluated using eq.[eq6 ] and eq.[eq7 ] directly in laplace space , since explicit inversion of eq.[eq6 ] turned out to be too difficult , and an explicit expression for the mean time in the most general case turned out to be too lengthy for reproduction here .",
    "we , therefore , used mathematica ( wolfram research inc . , version 7 ) to compute the mean time from eq.[eq6 ] after substituting eq.[eq19]-[eq20 ] and eq.[eq23]-[eq24 ] . in all the following analysis , we use the limits @xmath98 and @xmath99 , i.e. , microtubule nucleation is assumed very fast and boundary - induced catastrophes are assumed to be instantaneous .",
    "these assumptions are not strictly necessary , but reduces the number of active parameters . since a finite nucleation rate and a non - zero delay before catastrophe at the boundary would increase the total time , our estimates for the mean search time obtained henceforth may be regarded as theoretical lower limits .    experimental measurements of the microtubule kinetic parameters show some distinct changes as the cell progresses from interphase to mitosis@xcite . however , the nature of the changes are different for different types of cells , and the general qualitative features appear to bear a strong correlation to the cell size .",
    "yeast cells show a reduction in both catastrophe and rescue frequencies , but the changes are relatively small . in mammalian cells , which are typically larger , there is a marked fall in rescue frequency between interphase and mitosis , and a two - fold increase in catastrophe frequency . in _ xenopus",
