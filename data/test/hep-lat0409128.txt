    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 errors are also small , from dispersion relation and renormalization constants .",
    "the first two features are especially significant for light quarks .",
    "many exciting results at low quark masses have been reported using overlap fermions . here",
    "we want to make the point that using overlap fermions can also alleviate some problems with simulating heavy quarks .",
    "the last feature , demonstrated in  @xcite , is an unexpected bonus in this regard .",
    "the key observation is that the discretization errors are only about 5% all the way upto @xmath7 .",
    "we make our case using hyperfine splitting in the charmonium system .",
    "it is known that with staggered quarks , there is an ambiguity about nambu - goldstone ( ng ) and non - ng mode for the @xmath8 , resulting in widely different estimates of hyperfine splitting ",

    "result from a 2 + 1 dynamical simulation using tree - level @xmath10 still falls short of the experimental value by about 20%  @xcite .",
    "although costly , overlap fermions offer the best solution  they do not have flavor symmetry breaking , they guarantee that the @xmath4 error is absent _ without _ any tuning and they are relativistic . furthermore , @xmath11 errors appear to be small  @xcite .",
