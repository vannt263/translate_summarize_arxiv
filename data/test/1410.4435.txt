    "thin - film polycrystalline photovoltaics are a fully mature technology , with high power conversion efficiency ( 21 % for cdte ) , low fabrication costs , and proven competitiveness in the photovoltaic market @xcite . however , despite decades of research , basic questions persist regarding the role of microstructure in their operation and performance @xcite .",
    "one reason for this is that many established techniques for photovoltaic characterization , such as luminescense or charge transport methods , probe the material properties on length scales far greater than that of the material structural and electronic inhomogeneity ( e.g. the grain size - typically 1 @xmath0 ) .",
    "electron beam induced current ( ebic ) , on the other hand , is a measurement technique which can spatially resolve the electrical response of the material on length scales less than a grain size @xcite . in an ebic experiment , a focused beam of high energy electrons impinges on a sample , generating free electron - hole pairs .",
    "the size of the electron - hole pair generation bulb depends on the electron beam energy : e.g. for a beam energy of 3 kev , the excitation bulb length scale is 50 nm in cdte @xcite .",
    "some fraction of the excited electron - hole pairs are separated by internal fields and extracted , resulting in a measured charge current .",
    "the ratio of collected current to charge generation rate is the ebic efficiency , and can be used to characterize the recombination .",
    "ebic is naturally suited to measure the minority carrier diffusion length and the surface recombination velocity @xcite .",
    "recent work also studies grain boundary properties using ebic @xcite , identifying @xmath1 treatment as the key to changing grain boundaries from regions of increased recombination to regions of increased charge collection @xcite .    despite the advantages of ebic measurements described above",
    ", quantitative analysis in thin film polycrystalline materials is challenging : basic properties of the data ( such as the maximum collection efficiency ) do not conform with established models of ebic response .",
    "@xcite presents a critical analysis of ebic models , and uses numerical simulation to demonstrate two scenarios which lead to deviations from the  expected \" behavior of ebic signals . in the first scenario ,",
    "a diffusion length less than the drift length results in a reduced collection efficiency within the depletion region .",
    "our recent work develops an analytical model for describing ebic response in this regime @xcite . in the second scenario , large electron beam currents result in  high injection \" of electron - hole pairs , drastically changing the electrostatic potential and the resulting ebic lineshape . in this work",
    ", we explore the effect of high injection with a combination of numerical and analytical models in 1 , 2 , and 3 dimensions .",
    "high injection effects have generally been considered important when the density of injected charge exceeds the doping density @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we find that the onset of the high injection regime is more specifically related to the product @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the majority carrier mobility , @xmath5 is the built - in potential , @xmath6 is the sample thickness , and @xmath7 is the system dimensionality . roughly speaking ,",
    "when carriers are generated at a rate which exceeds the maximum current accommodated by  built - in \" electric fields and material resistivity , charges accumulate and screen the built - in field .",
    "this results in major distortions in the built - in potential and subsequent changes of the ebic signal .",
    "the high injection regime may be accessible in an ebic experiment due to the large number of electron - hole pairs generated per incident electron .",
    "each electron generates approximately @xmath8 electron - hole pairs , where @xmath9 is the material bandgap and @xmath10 is the energy of the exciting electron beam ( typically @xmath11 ) . for a material with @xmath12 , and a beam current of @xmath13 with energy @xmath14 , the excitation bulb volume is @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting excitation rate density is @xmath16 , exceeding more typical generation rate densities of @xmath17 ( 1 sun illumination ) by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "this indicates that ebic experiments may drive the system into a nonlinear regime .",
    "experiments typically strive to ensure the system remains in the linear regime , in part because a theoretical treatment of the material response in nonlinear regimes is less well developed .",
    "the current work aims to describe one aspect of nonlinear response , specifically charge accumulation and resulting screening of internal fields in the material .",
    "we find an implicit expression for the ebic response as a function of total generation rate and beam position .",
    "we then compare the model predictions to experimental results of cdte , and find qualitatively similar features .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we describe the numerical model in general terms , and describe the analytical model in 1 , 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "we compare the analytical model to the numerical simulation in 1 and 2 dimensions . we then present comparisons between ebic experiments on two samples and the 3 dimensional model .",
    "we formulate the onset of high injection effects in terms of the device thickness , the built - in potential , and the absorber resistivity ( recall the resistivity @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the absolute value of the electron charge , @xmath4 is the carrier mobility , and @xmath2 is the carrier density ( doping ) ) .",
    "to develop a physical picture of the system response in the high injection regime , we use numerical simulation to assist in identifying the key physics involved and to serve as a check on the analytical models .",
    "the numerical model is a standard implementation of the coupled drift - diffusion equations for electrons and holes combined with the poisson equation , and includes shockley - read - hall recombination .",
    "we choose parameters that are typical for thin film solar cells ( see the caption of fig . [ fig:1d ] ) .",
    "we also preface the discussion with a comment on the role of system dimensionality . in the classic description of ebic measurements by donolato and others ,",
    "the collection efficiency is governed by the diffusion and recombination of minority carriers in the neutral region .",
    "these works explicitly show that , for the purposes of calculating the ebic efficiency , the 3-dimensional system can be reduced to a 1-d system @xcite .",
    "this simplification follows from the system linearity , and the fact that the quantity of interest ( the ebic efficiency ) is a _ ratio _ of the system response ( the current ) to the driving input ( the generation rate ) .",
    "we consider nonlinear effects in this work and find that the system behavior changes qualitatively with system dimensionality .",
    "experimental comparisons are only meaningful for the 3-dimensional model , nevertheless the systems of reduced dimension offer clear insight into the important physics which govern this nonlinear regime .",
    "we present results in terms of the ebic efficiency @xmath22 , defined as the ratio of the measured current to the total charge generation rate of electron - hole pairs @xmath23 .",
    "the experimental generation rate depends on beam energy , and is estimated as @xcite : @xmath24 note that the units of @xmath23 depend on the system dimensionality @xmath7 , according to @xmath25 .",
    "also note that @xmath23 is is the _ total _ generation rate ( as opposed to the generation rate _ density _ ) .",
    "the role of dimensionality in the system behavior is discussed at length in sec .",
    "[ sec:3dmain ] .",
    "additionally , the models presented here assume an excitation length scale which is smaller than the depletion width and diffusion length , so that they apply most directly to low beam energies ( lower than @xmath14 for materials such as cdte ) .",

    "[ fig:1d](b ) shows the ebic lineshapes for increasing values of the electron beam current @xcite . for lower values of the beam current ,",
    "the lineshape consists of a plateau of nearly perfect collection efficiency over the width of the depletion region , followed by an exponential decrease of the collection into the neutral region .",
    "the length scale of the ebic signal decay is the minority carrier diffusion length .",
    "this regime is well described by the previously derived analytic models @xcite . for larger beam currents ,",
    "the maximum collection efficiency is decreased , and is shifted into the interior of the sample .",
    "[ fig:1d](c ) shows the electrostatic potential in the device for three values of the beam current , for a delta - function excitation located deep within the depletion region at @xmath28 . for low beam current ,",
    "the energy bands are only slightly perturbed from their equilibrium values . at higher beam currents ,",
    "an increasing portion of the potential drop across the device takes place over the neutral region .",
    "this potential drop can be understood as the driving force for _ majority _ carriers from the @xmath27-type side of the device : the potential drop over the neutral region @xmath29 satisfies @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the hole mobility , @xmath31 is the doping density , and @xmath32 is the length of the neutral region . as @xmath23 increases , the potential drop required to extract all the carriers exceeds the built - in potential . at this point , charge accumulation sets in , which partially screens the built - in field .",
    "this is shown in the curve of fig . [ fig:1d](c ) for @xmath33 ( black dashed curve ) .",
    "carriers diffuse and recombine within this screened region , and the potential drop occurs over a smaller length , increasing the driving field . in this regime ,",

    "the first boundary condition on @xmath46 is a discontinuity in the current @xmath47 at the excitation position @xmath40 . for the second boundary condition",

    "is confined to the region outside of @xmath41 , and therefore takes places over a length @xmath52 .",
