    "it is a non - renormalizable interaction that is interpreted as an effective field theory , valid below some scale @xmath18 .",
    "the details of the physics that break electroweak symmetry determine the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian . at energies small compared to @xmath18 , it is sufficient to consider those terms that are suppressed by @xmath19 with respect to eq .",

    "we have previously discussed the case in which the new physics contains a custodial @xmath3 global symmetry that is broken only by the hypercharge coupling @xmath20 and by the mass splittings in the left handed @xmath3 fermion doublets @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we specialized to the case of very high energy experiments in which the scalar interactions are stronger than the gauge interactions and it is consistent to set all the custodial @xmath3 violating counterterms in the next - to - leading order effective lagrangian to zero .",

    "it corresponds to the parameter `` u '' of peskin and takeuchi @xcite .",
    "we will focus on a special operator , that apart from breaking the custodial symmetry , violates parity and charge conjugation while conserving cp .",
    "the interest of this operator lies in the fact that it is unique , and that violating parity , it can in principle produce signatures that will set it apart from the other next - to - leading terms in the effective lagrangian .",
    "furthermore , since the weak interactions violate parity , there is no reason to expect this operator to have the additional suppression factors usually associated with cp violation .",
    "observation of substantial effects in the custodial @xmath3 breaking sector of the theory would have significant implications in our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "we find it convenient to use the vector equivalence technique @xcite , in which the spinor expression @xmath64 is replaced with the equivalent vector @xmath65 ( @xmath66 being a right - handed electron ) .",
    "this allows computation of the amplitudes by explicitly replacing expressions for all four - vectors in the @xmath23 center of mass frame .",
    "we then find that the differential cross - section contains a contribution from the interference of the @xmath52 term and the lowest order amplitude .",
    "it also contains a contribution proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "these contributions are present for both electron polarizations .",
    "however , the cross - section for left - handed electrons is much larger than the cross - section for right - handed electrons , and is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath52 .",
    "this is why the studies of unpolarized cross - sections in the literature have found the effect of @xmath52 to be less important than that of other ( parity conserving ) anomalous couplings .",
    "we will show that the cross - section with right - handed electrons is much more sensitive to @xmath52 than the unpolarized cross - section is .",
    "however , deviations of the cross - section ( polarized or not ) from its minimal standard model value can also be due to any of the parity conserving anomalous couplings that we have ignored .    of greater interest to us",

    "other anomalous couplings do not contribute to the forward backward asymmetry in @xmath76 and they are not considered here .    as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ diffc ] , there is a term in @xmath70 that is linear in @xmath77 ( the scattering angle in the center of mass ) .",
    "this term arises from the interference of @xmath74 and @xmath78 and gives rise to a forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "although there is a similar term in the differential cross - section for @xmath79 , in that case one also has a @xmath57-channel neutrino exchange diagram that gives rise to a very large forward - backward asymmetry within the minimal standard model .",
    "thus , if we want to isolate the @xmath75 term , it is very important to have right - handed electrons .",
    "since the cross - section for left - handed electrons is several orders of magnitude larger than that for right - handed electrons , it presents a formidable background . in figure  4",

    "a detailed phenomenological study of this process would have to address the issue of reconstruction of the scattering angle @xmath87 after the @xmath13 s decay .",
    "it may also be possible to enhance the sensitivity to @xmath52 by using the fact that the forward - backward asymmetry is present only in @xmath70 .",

    "this figure indicates a potential sensitivity of this process to values of @xmath96 which are within the interesting range .",
    "the subprocess cross - sections are identical for the different photon polarizations if we sum over the @xmath13 polarization . however , in the exact process @xmath97 the cross - section depends on the photon polarization . within the effective-@xmath13 approximation",
    "this dependence is also present because the polarized cross - sections of eq .",
    "[ swgpp ] are weighted by different factors : the distribution of @xmath13 s in the electron depends on the @xmath13 polarization .",
    "this is also seen in figure  7 .    from eq .",
    "[ swgpp ] we can see that the new term does not interfere with the lowest order term : there is no contribution linear in @xmath52 .",
    "this means that we can only construct observables sensitive to @xmath52 that are parity even and can thus be generated by other anomalous couplings .",
    "recall from ref .",
    "@xcite , that the amplitude eq .",
    "[ wgppvbf ] receives contributions from the next - to - leading order operators @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 ; and that these contributions do interfere with the leading amplitude .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that the cross - section is more sensitive to the @xmath67 term than to those terms proportional to @xmath98 , @xmath99 or @xmath100 in very high energy machines .",
    "the reason for this is that the @xmath67 term is the only one that contributes to the amplitude where all three vector - bosons are longitudinally polarized ( this is the source of @xmath101 in eq .  [ swgpp ] ) and we expect these terms of `` enhanced electroweak strength '' to dominate at high energies .    to construct an observable that can single out the @xmath52 coupling we need a term in the differential cross - section linear in @xmath52 . if we go beyond the effective-@xmath13 approximation , the new term proportional to @xmath52 will interfere with the lowest order amplitude through the parity violating term in the fermionic structure function @xcite .",
    "going beyond the effective-@xmath13 approximation requires the inclusion of the diagram in figure  6b as well .",
    "the interference term , not being present in the effective - w approximation , is thus kinematically suppressed .",
    "it appears that this process can potentially place significant constraints on @xmath52 , but a detailed phenomenological study of the real process @xmath88 and its backgrounds is needed to draw any conclusions .",
    "these rare decays receive contributions from the parity violating effective lagrangian eq .",
    "[ leffpv ] at the one - loop level .",
    "one - loop amplitudes with one vertex from the @xmath35 effective lagrangian are @xmath102 .",
    "a complete study thus requires the next to next to leading order counterterms , as well as two loop contributions from the leading order effective lagrangian .",
    "however , we will find that our one - loop amplitudes are finite so we will be able to draw some conclusions from our incomplete analysis . as a minimal consistency check ,",
    "we first look at the effects on the gauge boson self - energies that could arise at the same order .",
    "this involves , for example , the potential contributions to @xmath41 from one - loop diagrams with one next - to - leading ( @xmath52 ) vertex .",
    "however , one can easily see that there are no contributions to the gauge boson self - energies linear in @xmath52 .",
    "this is evident , as there are not enough independent four - vectors to saturate the indices of the epsilon tensor . a contribution to the self - energies ( and to @xmath22 )",
    "quadratic in @xmath52 needs two next - to - leading vertices , and is therefore one - order higher in perturbation theory ( @xmath103 in our notation ) .",
    "as is well known , the effective operators responsible for rare meson decays arise from box and penguin diagrams @xcite . since the lowest order effective lagrangian ( complete with fermions ) , and the new term eq .  [ leffpv ] , are separately gauge invariant , we are free to treat the two terms independently .",
    "we argued that the lowest order effective lagrangian is just what remains when one removes the higgs - boson from the standard model by taking its mass to infinity .",
    "however , it is easy to convince oneself that the standard model operators responsible for rare @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays do not depend on the higgs - boson interactions .",
    "this is a consequence of the usual approximation in which external quark masses and momenta are set to zero .",
    "this means that , for example , higgs - penguin diagrams in which a higgs - boson couples to @xmath13 s or to top - quarks vanish in the limit of vanishing external quark masses and momenta . since we will work in this approximation ,",
    "our lowest order effective lagrangian will simply reproduce the minimal standard model results which are usually obtained in @xmath104 gauges .",
    "as we said , the new term eq .  [ leffpv ] is separately gauge invariant , so we may choose to perform the calculations involving this term in any other gauge .",

    "it is therefore not possible to place significant constraints on the short distance component ( and thus on @xmath52 ) from the _ measured _ rate for this mode .",

    "we have studied the possibility of observing the leading parity violating operator in an effective lagrangian description of the symmetry breaking sector of the electroweak interactions .",
    "we have considered several observables that are even under parity and that would not distinguish between the effect of the parity violating interaction and a parity conserving one .",
    "we have also studied one observable ( the forward backward asymmetry in @xmath55 ) that would signal exclusively the parity violating interaction .",
    "the parity violating operator also breaks custodial @xmath3 symmetry , and therefore its natural size depends on whether the fundamental theory has a custodial symmetry or not . in theories with a custodial symmetry ( or an approximate one ) ,",
    "we expect @xmath52 to be @xmath122 whereas without a custodial symmetry it could be @xmath123 .",
    "the minimal standard model generates @xmath52 at one - loop at the @xmath124 level .",
    "the most promising place to look for a non - zero value of @xmath52 is a forward - backward asymmetry in polarized @xmath2 collisions .",
    "the sensitivity of this asymmetry to @xmath52 is significantly reduced when the polarization of the electron beam is not near 100% .",
    "the asymmetry is sensitive to @xmath52 in machines with a center of mass energy as low as 200  gev , but a much better sensitivity is obtained at higher energies . at higher energies ,",
    "the total cross - section is also sensitive to @xmath52 provided that there is a high degree of @xmath125 polarization .",
    "we found that in addition to the usual anomalous three gauge boson vertex associated with @xmath52 , gauge invariance requires the existence of a four gauge boson vertex @xmath126 that is also proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "we performed a preliminary study of the sensitivity of an @xmath127 collider to @xmath52 that makes use of this new coupling .",
    "we find that at very high energies there is an increased sensitivity to @xmath52 because the new operator contains a coupling of the photon to three longitudinal vector bosons not present in the minimal standard model .",
    "the enhanced interactions of longitudinal vector bosons at high energies are thus the origin of the potentially large sensitivity of the process @xmath88 to @xmath52 .",
    "we find that the rare decays @xmath112 and @xmath119 can easily place bounds of @xmath118 on @xmath52 , but that to improve this , one needs a precise measurement of the rate combined with knowledge of all the standard model parameters .    a search for @xmath52 in these observables would yield valuable information on the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
