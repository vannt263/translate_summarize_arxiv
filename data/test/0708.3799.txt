    "recently , the su@xmath0-symmetric generalization of the standard su(2 ) hubbard model@xcite has been intensively studied theoretically.@xcite apart from its theoretical interest this model may mimic strongly correlated electron systems where the orbital degrees of freedom of @xmath13 and @xmath14 electrons play important role and these extra degrees of freedom are taken into account by considering @xmath9-component fermions . on the other hand , ultracold gases in optical lattices may also be simulated by such multi - component models .    the hamiltonian of the model is usually written in the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of sites in the chain .",

    "@xmath21 is the particle - number operator , @xmath22 is the hopping integral between nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath23 is the strength of the on - site coulomb repulsion . in what follows @xmath22 will be taken as the unit of energy .",
    "the model behaves as an @xmath9-component tomonaga ",
    "luttinger liquid at generic fillings",
    ". other type of behavior may appear at commensurate fillings due to umklapp processes .",
    "the possible phases , their nature and the critical coupling where they appear have been studied in detail for two special commensurate fillings of the band , namely for half filling and @xmath24 filling.@xcite it is well established by now that the ground state is a fully gapped bond - ordered dimerized state in the half - filled case for any @xmath25 .",
    "contrary to this , the ground state remains translationally invariant in the @xmath24-filled case , and only the charge mode acquires a gap for @xmath26 . while assaraf _",
    "_ @xcite argued that @xmath27 is finite , our recent numerical work@xcite has suggested a much less , perhaps @xmath28 critical value above which multiparticle umklapp processes become relevant .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the su(@xmath9 ) hubbard model has a rich phase diagram in the attractive case , too.@xcite the one - third - filled su(3 ) model has two distinct phases in the high - dimensional limit . in one of them",
    "the fermions form trions while in the other phase a color superfluid state emerges .",
    "the existence of these phases is not yet settled in one dimension .    in the present paper ,",
    "the role of multiparticle umklapp processes will be further analyzed for general commensurate fillings @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are relatively prime .",
    "we try to establish under what conditions the umklapp processes can generate gaps in the charge or spin sectors , and when and how the translational symmetry is broken . to this end ,",

    "in the numerical part , the length - dependence of the entropy of finite blocks of a long chain is studied .",
    "recently , it has been shown that quantum phase transitions can be conveniently studied by calculating some measure of entanglement.@xcite this can either be a local quantity , e.g. , the concurrence@xcite , a global quantity , e.g. , the fidelity,@xcite or the entropy of a block of several sites.@xcite as has been demonstrated recently,@xcite the oscillatory behavior of the block entropy can reveal the position of soft modes in the excitation spectrum of critical systems or the spatial inhomogeneity of gapped models .",
    "this will allow us to demonstrate that at commensurate fillings @xmath3 the type of ground state of the one - dimensional su(@xmath9 ) models depends on whether @xmath7 , @xmath8 , or @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the block entropy , the corresponding peaks in its fourier spectrum , and their relationship to the known properties of the half - filled and @xmath24-filled models are recalled in sec .",

    "recently it has been pointed out by some of us @xcite that a wider variety of behavior may be found for the length - dependence of the block entropy .",

    "more precisely if the amplitude of a peak at a nonzero wave number @xmath44 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit , this indicates a periodic spatial modulation of the ground state with wavelength @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "if a marked peak appears in @xmath43 but its amplitude vanishes as @xmath46 , this allows to identify the wave vector of soft modes in critical models .    in a recent work @xcite",

    "this indicates gapless behavior and gives @xmath12 .",
    "this is in agreement with the theoretical expectation , since the charge mode becomes gapped due to multiparticle umklapp processes and only the @xmath55 spin modes are gapless .",
    "a distinct behavior is found in half - filled systems , as seen in panels ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 oscillates with period two , and if only every second point is taken , it seems to saturate beyond some block length , before decreasing again , indicating that the corresponding models are fully gapped .",

    "it is seen that in the @xmath24-filled case the fourier components at @xmath57 vanish in the thermodynamic limit , while a finite value is obtained at @xmath58 for half - filled models .",
    "this corroborates our finding that the @xmath24-filled su(@xmath9 ) models are critical with a spatially uniform ground state while a gapped bond - ordered dimerized phase appears at half filling .     for various @xmath9 and fillings for @xmath54 .",

    "these results indicate that the role of umklapp processes depends on the relationship between the number of components @xmath9 and the relative primes @xmath4 and @xmath5 characterizing the commensurate filling . in what follows this problem",
    "will be studied first analytically in a bosonization approach and large-@xmath9 expansion technique , and then numerically using the dmrg method .",
    "following the usual procedure we write the hamiltonian in momentum space and linearize the free - particle spectrum around the two fermi points @xmath75 .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the low - lying excitations determine the physics of the system . depending on whether the momentum of the fermions is close to @xmath76 or @xmath77",
    ", one can distinguish left- and right - moving particles , and the interaction processes also can be classified on the basis of whether the incoming and scattered particles are right or left movers and the momentum transfer is small ( forward scattering ) or large , of the order of @xmath78 ( backward scattering ) . in a generic model",
    "the strength of the various scattering processes may be different .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we neglect chiral processes in which both particles move in the same direction before and after the interaction , since they lead to the renormalization of the fermi velocity only .",
    "one can recognize that at generic fillings , where umklapp processes do not play a role , the forward and backward scattering processes can be interpreted as current  current interactions and their contribution to the hamiltonian density can be conveniently rewritten using dirac fermions@xcite in the following short form ( automatic summation for the repeated indices is understood ) : @xmath79 here @xmath80 denote the spin indices that can take the values @xmath81 , @xmath82 with @xmath83 are the dirac matrices , in our case the standard pauli matrices ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , and @xmath86 . while the hubbard model contains a single interaction parameter @xmath23 , the couplings @xmath87 may be different for physically different processes in more realistic models . in the renormalization - group treatment",
    "we will assume this to be the case .",
    "it is assumed , however , that the spin of the fermions does not change in the scattering process and the couplings are symmetric under the exchange @xmath88 .",
    "if the fermion field @xmath89 is decomposed into left- and right - moving components according to @xmath90 the usual backward- and forward - scattering processes are in fact recovered . in the standard @xmath36-ology@xcite notation @xmath91",
    "is denoted by @xmath92 , and @xmath93 by @xmath94 .",
    "the well - known renormalization - group ( rg ) equations , the @xmath95 function can be written for these scattering processes in a short form:@xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the cut - off parameter .",
    "these rg equations have been analyzed earlier@xcite and it was found that the backward - scattering processes scale out at generic fillings in the su(@xmath9 ) hubbard model and for this reason this model is equivalent to an @xmath9-component luttinger liquid in this case .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized@xcite and the excitation spectrum can be determined exactly in bosonic phase - field representation.@xcite there is one symmetric combination of the phase fields with different spin indices , this is the so - called charge mode : @xmath98 while the @xmath55 antisymmetric combinations give the spin modes : @xmath99\\ ] ] with @xmath100 .    similarly to the spin - charge separation in the two - component luttinger model ,",
    "one finds complete mode separation .",
    "the hamiltonian density is the sum of the contributions of the individual modes , @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "each term has the usual bosonic form : @xmath103 ^ 2   + \\frac{1}{\\pi k_j } \\left[\\partial_x\\phi_j(x)\\right]^2 \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the momentum canonically conjugated to @xmath105 .",
    "the renormalized velocities and the luttinger parameters can be given in terms of the new couplings @xmath106 appearing after diagonalization@xcite in the spin indices :      in a finite system , where the momentum is quantized in units of @xmath107 , the excitation spectrum of the luttinger model can be written as : @xmath108 where @xmath109 are integers describing the bosonic excitations and @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the change in the number of particles in the @xmath112th channel , and similarly @xmath113 describes the current in the @xmath112th channel created by adding particles to or removing them from the branches of the dispersion relation .",
    "the total momentum is given by @xmath114 thus soft modes appear not only at zero momentum but at integer multiples of @xmath115 , too , since the charge current @xmath116 is an even number if the total charge is conserved .",
    "since @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the number of particles in the system , and the filling of the band is @xmath119 , the position of these soft modes depends on the filling only , @xmath120 .    we know that the usual umklapp processes , scattering of two right movers into left - moving states or vice versa , that were neglected so far , are relevant in a half - filled system for any @xmath9.@xcite multiparticle umklapp processes may become relevant at other commensurate fillings . to see what kind of processes are allowed we have to take into account that the total quasimomentum transferred in an umklapp process has to be an integer multiple of @xmath121",
    ". if the band is @xmath3 filled and consequently @xmath122 , @xmath5 particles have to be scattered from one fermi point to the opposite one to satisfy this condition .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : umklappok ] .",
    "since there are @xmath9 different types of fermion in the su(@xmath9 ) model , and the hubbard interaction is local , only such umklapp processes are allowed by the pauli principle in which the number of scattered particles is less than or equal to @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath5-particle umklapp processes are forbidden in our model when @xmath123 .",
    "the role of multiparticle umklapp processes in the conductivity of the su(2 ) hubbard model has been studied in ref .  [ ] . a different aspect , whether the charge and spin modes are coupled or not by the possible multiparticle umklapp processes has been considered for the su(@xmath9 ) model.@xcite the @xmath5-particle umklapp processes can be described in the bosonic phase - field representation by @xmath124 \\,.\\ ] ] the phase fields appearing here are the phases of the bosonic representation of the particles participating in the scattering process , and @xmath125 indicates that all spin indices have to be different .",
    "this hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the phase fields corresponding to the charge and spin modes , making use of the inverse of ( [ eq : modec ] ) and ( [ eq : modes ] ) .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath7 , only the symmetric combination of the phase fields , that is the charge mode defined in ( [ eq : modec ] ) appears in .",
    "this means that in this case the @xmath5-particle umklapp processes couple to the charge mode only . the hamiltonian density of the charge mode is identical to that of the well - known sine - gordon model which has a fully gapped excitation spectrum .",
    "thus the charge mode becomes gapped for finite @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath55 spin modes are not influenced by the umklapp processes in the @xmath24-filled case .",
