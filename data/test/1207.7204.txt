    "the exact solutions@xcite of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model significantly promote the research of phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "after that , the ising model becomes one of the most famous lattice models in statistical physics .",
    "another famous ising system , known as the baxter - wu model@xcite , is defined on the triangular lattice with pure three - spin interactions .",
    "the model was firstly proposed by wood and griffiths@xcite and exactly solved by baxter and wu@xcite by relating the model with the coloring problem on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the solution gives the critical exponents @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , which are exactly the same as those of the 4-state potts model@xcite , which can be derived via the coulomb gas theory@xcite .",
    "this means that the baxter - wu model belongs to the universality class of the 4-state potts model .",
    "the critical properties of the 4-state potts model are modified by logarithmic corrections@xcite due to the second temperature field , which is marginally irrelevant@xcite . with the two leading temperature fields simultaneously vanishing ,",
    "the leading critical singularities of the baxter - wu model@xcite do not have logarithmic factors .",
    "_ generalize the baxter - wu model in @xcite where the spins are allowed to be @xmath6 states ( @xmath6 can be larger than 2 ) and the up- and down - triangles can have different coupling constants . both generalizations lead to discontinuous phase transitions .     and",
    "the spin on sublattice b is denoted @xmath7 ; for a square unit cell , there are four spins @xmath8 , and @xmath9 on sublattice a and one spin @xmath7 on sublattice b. ]    in 1972 , hintermann and merlini@xcite considered an ising system on the union - jack lattice ( as shown in fig . [ uj ] ) @xmath10 where the sum takes over all the square unit cells and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are the coupling constants .",
    "the model is similar to the baxter - wu model in the sense that both are ising systems with pure three - spin interactions .",
    "however the critical properties of the hm model are much more complicated . for the ferromagnetic case ( @xmath13 ) ,",
    "the model has four - fold degenerate ground states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ground ] .",
    "the nature of the phase transition breaking the @xmath14 symmetry of the order parameter can not be determined by the dimensionality of the system and the symmetry properties of the ground states@xcite .",
    "the exponents may vary with some tuning parameter without changing the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "such behavior has been found , e.g. , in the ashkin - teller model ( at ) @xcite , the eight - vertex model @xcite , the 2d @xmath15 model in a four - fold anisotropic field@xcite , and the ferromagnetic ising model with antiferromagnetic next - nearest neighbor couplings on square lattice@xcite .        through mapping to the eight - vertex model@xcite , the free energy of the hm model has been found exactly@xcite .",
    "the critical manifold and critical exponent @xmath16 varying with the ratio of couplings were obtained .",
    "based on the conjectured spontaneous magnetization @xcite and the spontaneous polarization @xcite of the eight - vertex model , wu calculated the spontaneous magnetizations of the model on two sublattices .",
    "the results show that the two magnetizations possess different critical exponents@xcite .",
    "the spontaneous magnetization of the eight - vertex model was derived later @xcite , however , the spontaneous polarization remains a conjecture .",
    "it is thus very necessary to verify the results numerically .    in current paper",
    ", we study the critical behavior of the ferromagnetic hm model with @xmath17 and @xmath18 numerically .",
    "the numerical procedure includes transfer matrix calculations and monte carlo simulations .",
    "the critical properties we studied includes not only the verification of the analytic predictions , but also the fractal structure of spin clusters , which is studied for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ sec_exact ] , we summarize the theoretical results of the model . in sec .",

    "we summarize in sec .",
    "[ sec_con ] .",
    "in this section , we summarize the analytical results for the hm model@xcite .    assign arrows between the nearest - neighboring ising spins of sublattice a ( fig .",
    "[ vertex ] ) : if the two spins beside the arrow are the same , the arrow is rightward ( or upward ) , otherwise it is leftward ( or downward ) .",
    "there is a two - to - one correspondence between the ising spin configurations and the arrow configurations .     spins . ]    after taking sum over the spin @xmath7 ( in the center of the unit cell ) , the boltzmann weights of the vertices are @xmath19 thus the model is mapped to the symmetric eight - vertex model@xcite , which has been exactly solved by baxter . for the ferromagnetic case considered in current paper ,",
    "the critical manifold is given by @xmath20 which leads to @xmath21 for the uniform case ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a very interesting critical property of the hm model is that the spontaneous magnetizations @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the sublattice a and b possess different critical exponents : @xmath35 the critical exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 were obtained by wu@xcite @xmath38 ( it should be noted that the author reversely wrote the two critical exponents in eq . ( 16 ) of @xcite . )",
    "according to the scaling law , this leads to two magnetic exponents @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 here @xmath39 has fixed value @xmath42 , while @xmath40 varies continuously with the parameters of the model .    in following sections , we will numerically study the critical properties of the model .",
    "the critical points and critical exponents will be numerically verified .",
    "especially , wu s result of @xmath37 ( @xmath40 ) is based on the unproved conjecture of the spontaneous polarization@xcite of the eight - vertex model , thus numerical verification is very necessary .",
