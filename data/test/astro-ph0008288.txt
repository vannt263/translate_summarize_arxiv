    "compact steep - spectrum sources ( csss ) are defined to be less than about 20 kpc in size ( h@xmath0 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , and have a steep high - frequency radio spectrum ( @xmath3 ) , where s@xmath4 .",

    "in this paper we present the results of an inter - planetary scintillation ( ips ) study of a large sample of css and gps radio sources at 327 mhz using the ooty radio telescope ( ort ) .",
    "these observations have been made with the objectives of ( i ) determining the sizes and prominence of hotspots to investigate the collimation of radio jets and the evolution of these sources ; ( ii ) investigating the existence of radio halos at a low frequency on the scale of hundreds of milliarcsec in addition to the more compact structure , suggestive of earlier periods of activity ; and ( iii ) determining the low - frequency spectra of compact components in an attempt to distinguish between different processes to explain the low - frequency turnover in the spectra of gps sources .",

    "a compact radio source or component seen through the solar wind exhibits scintillations due to electron density fluctuations in the interplanetary medium .",

    ", ips observations can be used to estimate the angular size of the scintillating component from the power spectrum , and the scintillation index , m , which is defined as @xmath5s / s . here",
    "@xmath5s is the rms of the flux density variations and s is the total flux density of the source ( e.g. little & hewish 1966 , 1968 ; cohen et al .",
    "1967 ; rao et al .",
    "1974 ) . by comparing m@xmath6 for a given source with a point source calibrator , m@xmath7 , we can estimate @xmath8 , the fraction of flux density in the scintillating component .",
    "generally the scintillation index , m , decreases with source size and becomes non - detectable when the source size is so large that the signal to noise ratio is poor .",
    "this limits the detectable ips size to about 0.@xmath94 at 327 mhz , which we will refer to as the ips cut - off size . also for the typical solar wind parameters , and the observing frequency of 327 mhz , the minimum size of the components which can be estimated is about 50 mas ( manoharan & ananthakrishnan 1990 ; gothoskar & rao 1999 ) . in a typical radio source",
    "the compact scintillating components could be the hotspots at the outer edges of the lobes , the nuclear or core components or prominent knots in a jet .",

    "many sources in our sample occur in more than one of the above lists and they have been counted only once in our list .",
    "also , more recent estimates of sizes and redshifts have led to a number of objects in our sample being larger than the canonical limit of 20 kpc .",

    "we have observed our sample of sources with the ort at 327 mhz in the phase - switched mode with a bandwidth of 4 mhz .",
    "the intensity variations of a source are sampled at a rate of 20ms .",
    "each source was observed at a number of solar elongations , @xmath15 , the observations at each elongation lasting about 15 - 20 minutes .",
    "our observational procedure is similar to the one described by manoharan & ananthakrishnan(1990 ) and gothoskar & rao ( 1999 ) .",
    "we also monitored the off source region simultaneously in the total - power mode , to look for any interference , and edited the data accordingly .",
    "since strong scattering occurs when @xmath16 about 12@xmath14 , observations were not made for lower values of @xmath15 .",
    "periods of large solar activity can also modify the average properties of the solar wind and hence the observed power spectrum .",
    "data during such periods were also edited since we are primarily interested in the properties of the sources ( manoharan 1993,1997 ) . for each source ,",
    "the average power spectrum of the scintillations was obtained at each elongation . from this spectrum",
    ", we estimate the scintillation index , m. the typical error in the scintillation index is usually less than about 5 per cent .",
    "variations in the interplanetary medium also leads to a scatter in the estimated value of @xmath8 .",
    "the percentage uncertainty in the fraction of scintillating flux density , @xmath8 , are listed in table 4 .",
    "an additional source of uncertainity in @xmath8 is the scintillations produced by the confusing sources present in the beam .",
    "the confusion limit of the ort is about 1.5jy .",
    "however , only a fraction of these sources have compact components which are likely to contribute to the scintillations . at low frequencies",
    "the scintillating features would be almost entirely the hotspots at the outer edges of the beams in the high - luminosity frii sources .",
    "estimating the fraction of frii radio sources in the b2 sample ( allington - smith 1982 ) to be about 60 per cent , and assuming the fraction of flux density in the scintillating hotspots to be about 50 per cent , yields a conservative estimate of the scintillation confusion to be about 0.2 jy .",
    "this affects significantly the interpretation of the scintillation visibility @xmath8 of the weaker sources .",
    "the values for the weak sources with s@xmath17 0.5 jy have been listed in the tables , but have not been used further in the discussions .",
    "the variation of scintillation index , m , with solar elongation for a point source is given by m@xmath18 .",
    "the index @xmath19 is obtained by a least - squares fit to the observed scintillation index of the ips calibrator , at various elongations .",
    "the compact radio source 1148@xmath20001 is the standard ips calibrator used at the ort ( cf .",
    "venugopal et al .",
    "1985 ) , and observations of this source during 1994@xmath2095 have been used to calibrate our observed scintillation indices . the observed scintillation index for",
    "a given source can be smaller than the calibrator at the same elongation if either only a fraction @xmath8 of the total flux density is in the scintillating component , @xmath21 , or the scintillating component is extended .",
    "we apply a correction to @xmath22 , for the finite size of the scintillating component using the model of solar wind ( manoharan & ananthakrishnan 1990 ; gothoskar & rao 1999 ) .",
    "this correction could not be applied to 12 of the 91 sources with s@xmath23 0.5 jy in the sample of largely css and gps radio sources ( table 1 ) , and 6 of the 19 larger sources ( table 2 ) since we could not estimate the size of the component reliably from our observed power spectrum .",
    "the component sizes are estimated from the best fits to the observed power spectrum after trying different values of component sizes and parameters of the standard solar wind model ( manoharan & ananthakrishnan 1990 ; manoharan et al . 1994 ; gothoskar & rao 1999 ) .",
    "the free parameters in this model are the solar wind velocity , random velocity component in the scintillating medium , axial ratio of the irregularities in the medium , the power - law index of the power spectrum of the turbulence of the medium , and the size of the scintillating source .",
    "the model fitting was done only for sources observed with a high signal to noise ratio .",
    "even though a 5 mas difference can be distinguised from the power spectrum , the typical inner - scale of the interplanetary medium corresponds to an angular scale of 50 mas , which is the typical error in the estimated angular sizes .",
    "if the structure of the scintillating component is simple , then it might be possible to have an idea of the two - dimensional structure of the source if the direction of the solar wind covers a wide range of position angles across the source .",
    "for example , in the case of an elliptical gaussian brightness distribution , a variation of the estimated size from a minimum to a maximum should be observed if the solar wind covers a range of position angles @xmath24 during the different observations of the source .",
    "there are 19 sources showing variation of the estimated size with the position angle of the direction of motion of the solar wind . assuming the structure to be elliptical , we have estimated the parameters of 4 sources where we had enough data to represent the ellipse .",
    "the results of our analyses are presented in table 4 , which is arranged as follows : column 1 : iau name ; column 2 : number of observations used to estimate the size of the scintillating component ; column 3 : estimated size of the scintillating component .",
    "for the four sources whose two - dimensional structure has been determined assuming it to be elliptical , the major and minor axes and the position angle of the major axis are quoted .",
    "the sources which exhibit variation in size , but without enough data to determine the position angle of an elliptical structure unambiguously , the maximum and minimum size are quoted . for the remaining sources , the average size is listed .",
    "column 4 : the total number of ips observations ; column 5 : the fraction of flux density of the scintillating component , @xmath8 , and the percentage error in @xmath8 .",
    "the hotspots , which are the high brightness regions in the outer lobes of the high - luminosity frii radio sources , indicate the mach disks where the jets terminate .",
    "the hotspots usually subtend small angles in the radio cores suggesting the high degree of collimation of the jets in these sources ( bridle & perley 1984 ; bridle et al . 1994 ; fernini et al .",
    "however , the jet momentum may be spread over a larger area than the cross - section of the jet itself due to the dentist - drill effect discussed by scheuer ( 1982 ) , where the end of the jet wanders about the leading contact surface drilling into the external medium at slightly different places at different times .",
    "recent simulations of 3d supersonic jets suggest that cocoon turbulence drives the dentist - drill effect ( norman 1996 ) .    in this section",
    "we study some of the properties of the hotspots for css as well as larger objects using the results from our ips survey and also available interferometric observations of hotspots .",
    "ips observations enable us to estimate the weighted average of the fraction of flux density in the scintillating components and their sizes . for sources larger than about 400 mas",
    "the scintillating components are usually the hotspots at the outer edges of the lobes .",
    "since the cores in csss are usually weak , especially at low frequencies , the scintillating components are the hotspots in the lobes . over the last few years the sizes of hotspots have also been determined reasonably reliably from interferometric observations for samples of compact steep - spectrum radio sources using largely vlbi and merlin observations , as well as for the larger objects using the vla .",
    "although there is no well - accepted definition of a hotspot ( cf .",
    "laing 1989 ; perley 1989 ) , we have used the following empirical definition .",
    "the hotspots are defined to be the brightest features in the lobes located further from the nucleus than the end of any jet , and in the presence of more extended diffuse emission these should be brighter by at least a factor of 4 ( cf . bridle et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the presence of multiple hotspots , only the primary hotspot has been considered .    in the following subsections we consider the possible dependence of the fraction of flux density from the hotspot and its size on both radio luminosity and overall projected linear size , and discuss possible constraints these might place on models of evolution of radio sources .",
    "we have excluded sources with prominent flat - spectrum nuclei , and those with a complex or core - jet morphology , and have considered only those sources where the scintillations are likely to be produced by the hotspots in the outer lobes . in the gps sources with two outer components ,",
    "we have assumed that these features are likely to be hotspots rather than being the counterparts of flat - spectrum nuclei .",
    "the compact - double structures seen in several gps sources , lack of variability , and polarization measurements as in 2134 + 004 ( cf .",
    "stanghellini et al .",
    "1998b ) lend some support to such an interpretation .",
    "the dependence of the prominence of the hotspots on radio luminosity was examined about 20 years ago ( e.g. jenkins & mcellin 1977 ; kapahi 1978 ) .",
    "jenkins & mcellin reported a strong correlation of the prominence of the hotspots with radio luminosity for the well - studied sample of 3cr radio sources .",
    "they defined the hotspots to be features with a size less than about 15 kpc .",
    "kapahi ( 1978 ) argued that this correlation is possibly due to the effective resolution being coarser for the higher redshift and hence higher luminosity sources .",
    "we investigate this relationship for the css as well as larger objects using both the ips and interferometric measurements .    in figure 1a and",
    "b the scintillation visibility , @xmath8 , is plotted against the total radio luminosity at 5 ghz for the sources from our ips observations ( tables 4 and 5 ) with an las @xmath25400 and 1000 mas respectively . since the effective size of the hotspots estimated from ips observations can depend on the relative prominence of the compact and halo components as well as their separation ( cf .",
    "duffet - smith 1980 ) , we have examined these trends for sources @xmath251000 mas where the blending of the two oppositely - directed hotspots is minimal .",
    "the scintillation visibility , @xmath8 , ranges from about 0.04 to 0.7 with most objects in the range of @xmath260.1 to 0.7 .",
    "the median value of @xmath8 is about 0.3 .",
    "the luminosity of most objects at 5 ghz lie in the range of about 10@xmath27 to 10@xmath28 w hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 , and in further discussions in this paper we confine ourselves largely to objects in this luminosity range .",
    "the scintillation visibility @xmath8 - luminosity diagrams for all the sources in tables 1 and 2 with s@xmath23 0.5 jy ( figures 1a and b ) , show no evidence of a significant dependence on radio luminosity .    we have also examined this relationship using the hotspot flux densities listed by bridle et al .",
    "( 1994 , hereinafter referred to b94 ) and fernini et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1997 , hereinafter referred to as f97 ) , whose sources have a similar luminosity to those of our samples and have been observed with resolution of about a few hundred mas , which is comparable to our ips cut - off size . a plot of the fraction of the hotspot flux densities , f@xmath29 = ( s@xmath30+s@xmath31)/s@xmath32 , from the two lobes against the total radio luminosity at 5 ghz for the sources from b94 and f97 are presented in figure 1c .",
    "the interferometric measurements also do not show a significant dependence of hotspot prominence on radio luminosity .",
    "we have presented the @xmath8-linear size diagram for the ips samples described in the earlier section in figures 2a and b , and the f@xmath29-linear size diagram for the b94 and f97 sources in figure 2c .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient for the ips sample of sources with las @xmath25 1000mas is @xmath200.32 , compared to @xmath200.15 for the b94 and f97 sources .",
    "again , we find no evidence of a significant dependence of either @xmath8 or f@xmath29 on linear size for these high - luminosity objects . there is , at best , a weak anticorrelation .    a relation between the prominence of hotspots with source size , and the total luminosity can in principle provide constraints on the models of evolution of radio sources .",
    "the luminosity of the hotspot depends on the pressure in the hotspot and the size of the hotspot .",
    "many models in the literature assume that the contribution of the hotspot to the total luminosity is negligible ( kaiser et al .",
    "1997 ; blundell et al . 1999 ) or do not consider the evolution of the hotspot independently ( chyzy 1997 ; begelman 1996 ) .",
    "the self - similar models assume that the pressure in the head of the jet , which is essentially the hotspot , scales with the mean cocoon pressure ( kaiser et al .",
    "1997 ; begelman 1996 ) by means of adjusting the size of the working surface .",
    "these models predict that the cocoon luminosity decreases as the source ages .",
    "this would suggest , in the light of our data , that the hotspot luminosity also decreases as the source grows old .",
    "non - relativistic numerical simulations have been attempted to understand the structures of the hotspots ( wilson & scheuer 1983 ; smith et al . 1985 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although these simulations reveal dynamically varying structures of the hotspots , the luminosity evolution needs to be studied .",
    "the simulations involving relativistic electron transport with the 3d mhd simulations of jets ( jones et al . 1999a ; tregillis et al .",
    "1999 ; jones et al .",
    "1999b ) might provide better insight into the evolution of the hotspots .",
    "a study of the variation of the size of the hotspots on the overall linear size of the objects could provide useful clues on the collimation of radio jets . a plot of the size of the scintillating components for sources larger that 1000 mas , against the overall linear size of the source shows no significant dependence of the hotspot size on the overall size of the object ( figure 3a ) . to examine any effect of contamination by diffuse emission around the hotspots ( cf . hewish & readhead 1976 ; duffet - smith 1980 )",
    "we have confined ourselves to objects above 1000 mas , and have also considered separately objects with @xmath33 0.3 ( figure 3b ) .",
    "we again find no evidence of a significant relationship .",
    "we also examine this trend using the sizes of hotspots determined by b94 and f97 , which have similar luminosity to our ips sample ( figure 3c ) .",
    "the interferometric measurements for the b94 and f97 sources also suggest that the hotspot sizes do not exhibit a significant dependence on the overall linear size .",
    "the hotspot sizes remain nearly constant with a mean value of about 3 kpc although the hotspot sizes range from about 1 to 10 kpc , implying that the jets have an approximately constant mean width beyond about 20 kpc .",
    "jeyakumar & saikia ( 2000a , b ) have earlier examined the dependence of hotspot size on projected linear size for css and gps objects , and find that the hotspot size increases linearly with the total linear size , suggesting that they evolve in a self - similar way . by comparing this trend with larger objects observed with a similar number of resolution elements , they suggested that there is a flattening of the relationship beyond about 20 kpc .",
    "the plots in figure 3 where most of the objects are larger than about 10 kpc are consistent with this flattening .",
    "the relationship between the hotspot sizes and the overall size of the source suggest that the jets are largely confined .",
    "the jets could be confined by the ambient pressure whose density falls with distance from the nucleus for sources less than about 20 kpc , while for larger scales the jets could be possibly magnetically confined .",
    "numerical simulations of the propagation of jets also show that the hotspot sizes do not tend to increase with linear size as the jets propagate outwards beyond a certain distance ( sanders 1983 ; wilson & falle 1985 ) .",
    "the recollimation of the jet can occur if the jet pressure falls more rapidly than the ambient pressure .",
    "in such a scenario one would expect recollimation to occur at a distance where the jet pressure falls below the ambient pressure . in the model of sanders ( 1983 )",
    "applied to the jet in ngc 315 , the reconfinement of the jet is accompanied by conical shocks which heat the jet causing it to reexpand . in this scenario ,",
    "the reconfinement region beyond about 20 kpc , where the mean hotspot width has an approximately constant value of @xmath263 kpc , requires a high ambient pressure , comparable to or larger than the jet pressure , beyond the css stage . on the large scales , where the ambient pressure may not be sufficient for confinement",
    ", the jet could be possibly held together by its own toroidal magnetic field ( cf .",
    "begelman et al . 1984 ) .",
    "magnetic collimation provides a natural explanation of the observed trend of a nearly constant width in the large sources .",
    "the mechanism of self - collimation by current - carrying jets has been examined by appl & camenzind ( 1992 , 1993a , b ) , and the development of kelvin - helmholtz and current - driven instabilities in these relativistic mhd jets have been studied by appl ( 1996 ) . in this scenario , the jet is initially pressure confined and becomes self - collimated by the magetic pressure when the ambient pressure drops below the jet pressure .",
    "the width of the jet in the pressure confined regime is determined by the ambient pressure alone , where the jet current is shielded by the surface currents ( appl & camenzind 1992 ) . the increase in jet width with source size in this phase is due to the decrease in ambient pressure .",
    "self - collimation becomes important when the ambient pressure falls just below the jet pressure . at this point ,",
    "the current , i , is estimated to be @xmath3410@xmath35p@xmath36r@xmath37 amp where p is in units of 10@xmath38 dyn @xmath39 and the radius of the jet r@xmath37 is in kpc ( appl & camenzind 1992 ) . for a hotspot radius of 1.5 kpc , which is",
    "the mean value for our large sources , and typical jet pressure of @xmath26@xmath40 dyn @xmath39 the current required to be carried by the jet is about 10@xmath41 amp .",
    "the variation of the sizes of the hotspots is consistent with pressure confinement in the css phase with the ambient pressure falling with distance from the nucleus , while at larger distances from the nucleus where the ambient pressure has fallen below the jet pressure , the jet could be possibly magnetically confined .",
    "the sources whose overall separation of the components are less than the ips cut - off size scintillate as a single source .",
    "a comparison of the sizes of the scintillating components with the vlbi - scale structure should enable us to infer the existence of milli - halos on the scale of hundreds of milliarcsec which may have been resolved out in the high - frequency vlbi observations , which are usually between 1.4 and 5 ghz .",
    "the extended emission with steeper spectrum may also be more prominent at low frequencies .    in figure 4 , we plot the sizes of the scintillating components inferred from the ips observations against the largest angular size estimated from the vlbi images for all objects with an overall angular separation less than about 400 mas .",
    "there are 21 objects which satisfy this criterion , and their properties can be found in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the sizes of the scintillating components estimated from the ips observations tend to be larger than the interferometric measurements , except for the source 0428 + 205 . here , the ips size is significantly smaller than the las , which is defined by the weak extended emission towards the north - west .",
    "the peak brightness of this component is about a factor of 37 weaker than the dominant component seen in the vlbi image at @xmath4218 cm .",
    "the size of the dominant component , whose peak brightness in the vlbi image is 1476 mjy / beam ( dallacasa et al .",
    "1995 ) and which is likely to contribute to most of the scintillating power , is similar to the ips size .",
    "since the uncertainty in the ips size could be as large as about 50 mas , we identify only those sources whose difference between the ips and vlbi sizes to be at least about 3 times 50 mas to be strong candidates for milli halos .",
    "these include the sources 1127@xmath20145 , 1341 + 144 , 1354@xmath20174 , 1518 + 047 and 1543 + 005 .",
