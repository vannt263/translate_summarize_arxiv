    "neutrino mass is by far the most important subject of study in neutrino physics and the mass of neutrinos has been the topic of intense experimental and theoretical investigation .",
    "there is convincing evidence of neutrino mass from several experiments and the landscape of particle physics has been fundamentally altered forever by this discovery .",
    "the theoretical question is not only how one can extend the standard model(sm ) to find models with massive neutrinos , but also how one can understand the smallness of the neutrino mass compared to that of the charged fermions .",
    "the origin of the small neutrino mass is still a mystery .",
    "it is commonly believed that neutrino masses are a low - energy manifestation of physics beyond the standard model and that their smallness is due to a suppression generated by a new high - energy scale , perhaps related to the unification of forces .",
    "this is achieved , for example , with the celebrated seesaw mechanism @xcite involving heavy particles.there are three different kinds of heavy particles that can induce an effective operator @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the sm lepton doublet , @xmath4 is the sm higgs doublet ) which can provide small neutrino mass for@xmath5 .",
    "there are three kinds of seesaw mechanism occurs in nature via the following three kinds of heavy particle :    1 .",
    "standard model fermion singlet , coupled to the leptons through dirac yukawa couplings and usually called right handed neutrinos ( type i seesaw @xcite ) .",
    "triplet scalar under @xmath6 with y=2 coupled to leptons through dirac yukawa couplings ( type ii seesaw @xcite ) .",
    "su(2 ) fermion triplet ( y=0 ) coupled to leptons through dirac yukawas ( type iii seesaw @xcite ) .",
    "one assumes that there were equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the universe at the time of the big bang or , at the end of reheat after inflation .",
    "but we observe today an enormous preponderance of matter compared with antimatter @xcite .",
    "leptogenesis has been extensively studied in first and 2nd kind of seesaw(for right handed singlet fermion and triplet scalar case respectively)@xcite which relates neutrino properties and hence the requirement of successful baryogenesis yields stringent constraint on the neutrino mass(both light and heavy neutrino case ) .",
    "a major part of matter in the universe is not visible and much of this is dark matter .",
    "therefore we can define two categories : baryonic dark matter , composed of baryons which are not seen , and non - baryonic dark matter , composed of massive neutrinos , or elementary particles which are as yet undiscovered .",
    "the particles which comprise non - baryonic dark matter must have survived from the big bang or , at the end reheat after inflation and therefore must be stable or have lifetimes in excess of the current age of the universe .",
    "recent cosmological observations @xcite not only tell us how much dark matter exists but also that it must be nonbaryonic it is not one of the known elementary particles contained within the standard model of particle physics .",
    "dark matter is a known unknown .",
    "we do not know what the underlying theory of dark matter is , what are the detailed particle properties of it , nor the particle spectrum of the dark sector . in this paper",
    ", we have discussed the leptogenesis scenario by the decay of the lightest neutral component of fermion triplet and it s phenomenological implications which may be testable in near future . the paper is organized like this : section ( [ sec : ourmodel ] ) give the particle content of an extra fermion triplet per each generation and an extra higgs doublet which are different from standard model particles by a discrete symmetry(@xmath7 ) . in section ( [ sec : neumass ] ) we discuss the neutrino mass generation by radiative mechanism . in section ( [ sec : lepto ] ) , the kinematical effect of the leptogenesis have been discussed and the scenario can alter the out - of equilibrium condition substantially .",
    "here we gave the first full calculation of thermal leptogenesis by the decay of @xmath6 triplet fermion @xmath0 .",
    "section ( [ sec : darkmatter ] ) discusses possible dark matter candidate in our model and discussed the possible phenomenology of fermion triplet @xmath0 .",
    "finally , section ( [ sec : conclusion ] ) gives the conclusion .",
    "in our model we extend the standard model by introducing a three generation of fermionic triplet neutrinos @xmath8(i=1,2,3 ) and one more higgs doublet @xmath1 .",
    "we impose a @xmath7 discrete symmetry on this model . under this symmetry transformation @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath1 change sign , while other fields remain the same . as a result of",
    "this symmetry , @xmath8 does not couple to the standard higgs @xmath4 through yukawa coupling .",
    "only the new higgs doublet @xmath1 couples to @xmath0 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now we can write down all the possible interaction terms for this model .",
    "it includes the gauge interactions , yukawa couplings and the higgs potential .",
    "however in this work only the yukawa interaction for the lepton and part of the higgs potential are relevant .",
    "the yukawa coupling and complete higgs potential are written as @xmath9 and @xmath10 \\label{pot } \\ ] ] here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the lepton doublet and the right - handed charged lepton respectively . since @xmath7 symmetry is exact and will not be broken , @xmath13 will not develop a non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "therefore the neutrino does not obtain mass at tree level as lepton number is conserved .",
    "however , given a term like @xmath14 $ ] in the potential , lepton number is not automatically conserved , but the lepton number violation should be small .",
    "hence , the value of the coupling @xmath15 must be small .",
    "in other words , neutrinos gets a non - zero mass , but obviously this mass is generated only at the loop level . for convenience and without loss of generality , we will chose the basis where the fermion triplet mass matrix is real and diagonal .",
    "in this section , the generic type iii seesaw mechanism by fermion triplet has been discussed .",
    "however , we do nt interest in generic seesaw .",
    "then we have shown that how samllness mass came from radiatively via triplet fermions at one loop diagram .    for generic type iii seesaw mechanism",
    ", one must replace three right handed singlet neutrinos by three fermion triplet neutrino under su(2 ) .",
    "the fermionic triplet is given as .",
    "@xmath16        the corresponding lagrangian for this model is given @xmath17    this gives rise to the diagram shown in fig.([neumass : triplet ] ) , and after integrating out the heavy @xmath0 field , one obtains the desired form for the seesaw neutrino mass @xmath18 hence by setting @xmath19 , one can explain the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "this is often referred to as the type iii seesaw mechanism .but this is given for general feelings of type iii seesaw to generate small neutrino mass .",
    "but we have different approach to get neutrino mass radiatively.then the above yukawa term is not allowed in our model .",
    "neutrino mass generation radiatively will be discussed in next subsection .",
    "there are no dirac masses between the left and right - handed neutrinos since the exact @xmath20 symmetry protects @xmath1 from obtaining vacuum expectation values .",
    "so , the neutrinos will remain massless at tree level unless the quartic scalar interaction @xmath21\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is included which gives mass at the one loop level as shown in fig:2 .",
    "because of the assumed @xmath22 symmetry , @xmath23 does not couple to @xmath24 through @xmath25 .",
    "hence @xmath24 is not the dirac mass partner of @xmath23 as in the canonical seesaw model @xcite . instead , @xmath23 couples to @xmath24 through @xmath26 ( which has no vacuum expectation value ) and obtains a radiative majorana mass in one loop @xcite , i.e.        @xmath27    where @xmath28 .",
    "this neutrino mass matrix can explain the neutrino oscillation data well as long as we set appropriate values for the parameters @xmath15 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we note that @xmath15 should be very small to generate desired neutrino masses",
    ". however , this tuning is not so bad nature since it can be controlled by a global symmetry which appears if we make @xmath15 zero .    for @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath24 very heavy , @xmath33\\ ] ] instead of the canonical seesaw expression of @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the observed neutrino mass can be naturally explained .",
    "for example , a value of @xmath35 can be obtained for a choice of parameters like @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    to check the consistency of this model with observed results on neutrino mass , we present a particular flavor structure of the yukawa sector which fits the neutrino data appropriately .",
    "consider such flavor structure for neutrino yukawa couplings as @xmath39 in this case the neutrino mass matrix can be written as @xmath40 and the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing is automatically realized for the neutrino mass matrix ( [ nmass ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , only two mass eigenvalues take nonzero values . thus",
    ", the neutrino oscillation data can be consistently explained as long as the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath41 these come from the required values for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "we need to consider the constraints from both the lepton flavor violating processes . in leptogenesis , the lightest @xmath30",
    "may then be much below the davidson - ibarra bound @xcite of about @xmath44 gev , thus avoiding a potential conflict of gravitino overproduction and thermal leptogenesis . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath26 is dark matter .",
    "leptogenesis provides a simple and elegant explanation of the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "a beautiful aspect of this mechanism is the connection between the baryon asymmetry and neutrino properties .",
    "just as there are three seesaw mechanisms , the decays of the corresponding heavy particles n @xcite , ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) @xcite , and ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) @xcite are natural for generating a lepton asymmetry of the universe , which gets converted @xcite into the present observed baryon asymmetry through anomalous baryon number violating interactions . just as n may decay into leptons and anti leptons because it is a majorana fermion ,",
    "the same is true for @xmath0 .",
    "the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath51 decays to sm left - handed doublet leptons and doublet scalars .",
    "the decay channel @xmath52 and its cp conjugate decay channel @xmath53 contribute to the lepton asymmetry .",
    "the lepton asymmetry parameter can be calculated by the interference of the decay of @xmath54 at tree and one loop diagram .",
    "leptogenesis is expected to occur through the decay of @xmath54 into a light lepton and an extra higgs doublet .",
    "if departure from equilibrium in @xmath54 decay is large , the lepton asymmetry is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the spin degrees of freedom of fermion triplet component .",
    ", so that their number density before they decay is @xmath57 if we assume they go out of equilibrium before they become non - relativistic . using @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the effective relativistic degree of freedom contributing to the entropy(@xmath60 )",
    ", we get @xmath61 this lepton asymmetry will then be reprocessed by anomalous electroweak sphaleron process ,",
    "leading to a baryon asymmetry @xmath62 combining equations ( [ nl ] ) and ( [ nb ] ) , we get the present baryon asymmetry as @xmath63 values of @xmath64 is required to account for the value @xmath65 obtained from cmbr result by wmap@xcite and from the successful theory of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "leptogenesis of first kind(by a right handed singlet fermion ) was first proposed by fukugita and yanagida @xcite .",
    "but leptogenesis of 2nd and 3rd kind(by a scalar triplet and a fermion triplet ) is not so simple .",
    "the main concern with the other possibilities is that gauge scatterings can keep @xmath66 triplets close to thermal equilibrium , conflicting with the third sakharov condition . in this letter",
    ", we carried out the calculation of the lepton asymmetry for the fermion triplet case and have discussed possible issues related to it . in our model , the decay of the heavy fermionic triplet neutrino(but lightest among the three generation and neutral i.e , @xmath54 ) can create a lepton asymmetry , if the yukawa couplings @xmath67 provide the source of the cp violation .",
    "the lowest order non - trivial asymmetry comes from the interference of the tree - level diagrams with the one - loop diagrams .",
    "we calculate the cp asymmetry and find it to be the same as that in the canonical seesaw model . if the fermionic triplet is heavier than the extra higgs field @xmath1 , it can decay to a light lepton(@xmath68 ) and an extra higgs ( @xmath1 ) . using the yukawa term @xmath69 , at the tree level",
    ", the decay widths are given by @xmath70 where the factor , @xmath71 depends on the mass of the decay product in addition to that of the decaying particle . for the increasing values of @xmath72",
    ", we get a smooth interpolation from @xmath73 to @xmath74 .",
    "usually the decay products are assumed to be very light and hence , this factor is taken to be @xmath75 .",
    "however this factor can also be very small for nearly degenerate mass between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 field .",
    "we shall consider the case when this factor is very small @xcite . in the present model , the value of parameter @xmath76",
    "is taken to be very small(of the order of @xmath77 ) and has been shown in next paragraph how this small value of @xmath76 can give required cp asymmetry to explain tev scale leptogenesis . at present",
    "we do nt have any explanation for the smallness of @xmath78 .",
    "but we hope that when this model will be embedded in any higher theory and some symmetry of that theory will provide an explanation .",

    "we can simplify the lepton asymmetry ( [ cpasymmetry ] ) as @xmath88 \\frac{m_{\\sigma_{1}^{}}^{}}{m_{\\sigma_{j}^{}}^{}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we remind that when the lightest particle is a fermion triplet neutrino @xmath54 , the lepton - asymmetry from its decay is given by the famous relation @xcite ( inserting the neutrino mass in that formula ( [ cpasymmetry2 ] ) ) , @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the biggest eigenvalues of the neutrino mass matrix and the cp phase , respectively .",
    "here we have assumed the neutrinos to be hierarchical @xcite .",
    "clearly , in the present case , the davidson ibarra bound @xcite is relaxed by a factor of @xmath92 .    for effectively creating a lepton asymmetry in the thermal evolution of the universe , the decays of @xmath93 should satisfy the condition of departure from equilibrium , which is described by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the total decay width of @xmath93 and @xmath96 is the hubble parameter with the planck mass @xmath97 and the relativistic degrees of freedom @xmath98 @xcite . in order to satisfy the out of equilibrium condition",

    "fermion triplets ( like scalar triplets ) have gauge interactions so that it is more difficult to have a non thermal abundance .",
    "it s worth mentioning that the gauge interactions involve two particles of fermion triplet ( see in fig .",
    "4 ) and are therefore doubly boltzmann suppressed at temperatures below their mass , so that they can not wash - out the lepton asymmetry in an efficient way . on the other hand , gauge interactions are effective at higher temperature and thermalize the initial abundance of @xmath54 , but the final baryon asymmetry does not depend on it almost @xcite .",
