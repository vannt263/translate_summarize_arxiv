    "in high - energy scattering , strong interaction plays a significant role both in the high - energy region and in the low - energy region .",
    "the scattering of energetic quarks and gluons with radiative corrections occur in the high - energy regime , in which perturbative qcd can describe the effects of the strong interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "strong interaction is also responsible for pulling the quarks and gluons out of the initial hadrons through the parton distribution functions , and for the hadronization of the energetic scattered partons through the fragmentation functions .",
    "these are nonperturbative aspects of the strong interaction in the low - energy regime .",
    "furthermore the strong interaction affects all these processes at different energy scales at the same time , therefore the effects of the strong interaction are entangled in a complicated way all through the scattering process from beginning to end .",
    "it is important to disentangle the short- and the long - distance effects of the strong interaction to have theoretical predictive power .",
    "this is achieved by the factorization theorem in which the scattering cross section is factorized into the hard , collinear and soft parts . the factorization proof in various hard scattering processes has been a long - standing problem in qcd @xcite .",
    "recently the advent of the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite facilitates the proof in a straightforward way .",
    "scet is formulated such that the collinear and the soft modes are decoupled at the lagrangian level , and the factorization of the scattering cross section into the hard , collinear and soft parts is intuitively transparent .    in high - energy processes ,",
    "final - state hadrons are typically clustered in collimated beams , which are called jets .",
    "jets are important tools to exploit information on standard model or beyond .",
    "there are many jet definitions depending on the kinematics , or the detector design , etc . @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will confine ourselves to the study of the various jet definitions used in @xmath4 annihilation , but it can be extended to @xmath5 scattering or to @xmath6 scattering .",
    "the jet definitions are realized by providing the jet algorithms which give rules on how to combine particles in forming a jet .",
    "the jet algorithms include the sterman - weinberg algorithm @xcite , the cone - type algorithm @xcite , the jade algorithm @xcite , the @xmath1 algorithm @xcite , the anti-@xmath1 algorithm @xcite , the cambridge / aachen algorithm @xcite to name a few .",
    "the basic issue in jet algorithms is how to combine adjacent final - state particles into a jet without ambiguity .",
    "the important ingredients of appropriate jet algorithms are such that they should yield infrared safety , and they can be employed conveniently both in theory and experiment . however , the implementation of a convenient jet algorithm in experiment is not always convenient in theory , or vice versa .",
    "the factorized form of the dijet cross section in @xmath4 annihilation can be obtained in the framework of scet .",
    "the cross section is factorized into the hard , collinear and soft parts .",
    "however , the factorization does not hold for any arbitrary jet algorithm if we require that each factorized part be infrared finite .",
    "if any factorized part contains infrared divergence for a certain jet algorithm , though the partial sum of the factorized parts is infrared safe , the factorization approach loses its physical meaning .    in order to approach the problem about which jet algorithms respect the factorization theorem",
    ", we devise a general jet algorithm , motivated by the @xmath1 jet algorithm , in which we introduce a parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the original exclusive @xmath1 algorithm is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the center - of - mass energy .",
    "for a given pair of partons @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with the energy @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , the parameter @xmath14 is constructed with the relative angle @xmath15 .",
    "physically this jet algorithm requires that the relative transverse momentum of every pair of final - state partons @xmath10 and @xmath11 be measured .",
    "if the smallest value of @xmath14 for a given pair of partons is less than a resolution parameter @xmath16 , they are combined into a jet .",
    "this process is repeated until all pairs have @xmath17 .",
    "if the relative transverse momentum is replaced by the invariant mass , the jet algorithm becomes the jade algorithm .",
    "here we employ the generalized exclusive jet algorithm , which is defined as @xmath18 where the power of the energy in eq .",
    "( [ yij ] ) is replaced by @xmath7 , and the resolution parameter @xmath16 remains dimensionless .",
    "as @xmath7 varies , the general jet algorithm includes all the jet algorithms mentioned above for specific values of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 algorithm is obtained for @xmath3 .",
    "the jade algorithm is similar to the case @xmath19 .",

    "we probe all the possible values of @xmath7 and compute the jet and the soft functions to see if they are well defined and free of infrared divergence . the phase space available for the collinear and the soft functions differs for different values of @xmath7 , so does the structure of divergence .",
    "the next - to - leading - order contribution of each factorized part will be computed accordingly , in which there are at most two particles in a jet .",
    "we compute each contribution using the dimensional regularization with the spacetime dimension @xmath22 regulating both the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the infrared ( ir ) divergences .",

    "so far , it has been proven that the ir divergence cancels in many processes . and , in fact , any physical quantity should be ir safe . in this case , the remaining divergence is of the uv origin .",
    "technically , we can put all the scaleless integrals to be zero , and also put all the poles in @xmath25 as the uv poles in @xmath26 .",
    "but this is possible only after it is verified that each factorized part is ir finite .",
    "we intend to verify which types of the jet algorithms guarantee the ir finiteness of each factorized part , and which do not , using the generalized jet algorithm .",
    "as it turns out , the jet algorithm for @xmath2 indeed yields ir - finite jet and soft functions , hence can safely put all the poles as the uv poles .",
    "however , for @xmath27 each jet and soft function contains ir divergence , and we can not naively put all the poles as the uv poles , though the jet cross section is ir finite .",
    "this verification is possible only when we distinguish the uv and ir divergences , which we explicitly show here at next - to - leading order .",
    "the existence of the ir divergence in the factorized part , or the breakdown of the factorization theorem was also considered in ref .",

    "only the jet cross section has been computed and the divergence is regarded as the uv divergence .",
    "this is justified since the cross section is a physical quantity free of ir divergence . however , the factorization property in high - energy scattering of the jet cross section or any other physical observables such as thrust is important to disentangle the strong interaction and to compute high - order corrections for better accuracy .",
    "then it is crucial to see if the factorization works or breaks depending on the jet algorithms .",
    "we address this problem by considering the ir finiteness of the jet and the soft functions in various jet algorithms and point out which jet algorithms allow the factorization theorem in the jet cross section .",

    "the theoretical uncertainty at nll order is not significantly reduced compared to the nlo fixed - order results .",
    "we expect that the uncertainty will be reduced at higher orders .",
    "in addition to the suppression of the resummed result for small @xmath16 , the fixed - order results tend to be more negative as @xmath7 decreases , while the jet cross sections have meaning only when they are positive .",

    "it turns out that the cone - type algorithm , which is equivalent to the inclusive @xmath1 algorithm at nlo , and the sterman - weinberg algorithm show similar shapes for the phase spaces @xcite , therefore we expect that the dijet cross section should be resummed in the cone - type algorithm to yield a meaningful answer .",
    "since the dijet cross section is ir finite in spite of the fact that both the jet and soft functions are ir divergent , one might expect that the resummed result for the @xmath1 algorithm ( @xmath3 ) can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath180 from the result with @xmath175 .",
    "indeed we can obtain the resummed result and verify that the cross section approaches zero for small @xmath16 .",

    "the structure of the divergence can be inferred from the observation of the phase spaces in @xmath79 space . when it is ambiguous for @xmath213 , the phase space in @xmath80 space is helpful in identifying the divergence . in explicit computation",
    ", we have verified that the expectation from the phase space is correct .",
    "to summarize , the jet algorithm for @xmath2 renders the jet and soft functions ir finite , thus guarantees the factorization of the dijet cross section . among the known jet algorithms , this includes the jade algorithm ( corresponding to @xmath19 ) , the cambridge / aachen algorithm ( @xmath20 ) and the sterman - weinberg and the cone - type algorithm ( @xmath30 ) and the anti-@xmath1 algorithm ( @xmath21 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the factorization breaks down with the jet algorithms with @xmath33 because the jet and soft functions contain infrared divergence .",
    "though the ir divergence is cancelled in the dijet cross section and gives a finite result , it breaks the factorization and the @xmath1 algorithm belongs to this category .",
    "the main point of the paper is that the structure of divergence in the collinear and soft parts depends on how the jets are defined .",
    "the important criterion is that each factorized part should be ir finite in order to respect the factorization .",
    "and according to our analysis of the generalized jet algorithm , only the jet algorithm with @xmath32 factorizes the dijet cross section in a strict sense .",
    "note that we have considered the so - called exclusive generalized @xmath1 algorithms @xcite , which is based on the @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "the scet version is presented in ref .",
    "the inclusive recombination algorithm @xcite is more suitable in hadronic collisions .",
    "but it turns out that the inclusive jet algorithm reduces to the cone - type algorithm @xcite at next - to - leading order in which there are three final - state particles .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 annihilation , the partonic center of energy is boosted along the beam direction compared to the hadron - hadron center of energy in hadronic collisions . therefore the physical observables in hadron - hadron scattering , as in lhc , should be described in terms of the boost - invariant quantities such as the transverse momentum , the rapidity and the azimuthal angle .",
    "it will be interesting to probe the jet properties arising from the jet algorithms in other types of scattering . and",
    "the analysis of the divergence structure in various jet algorithms , which we have probed here , can be extended to deep inelastic scattering and hadron - hadron collisions with the boost invariance along the beam direction to see if the structure of the divergence is sustained or if the kinematics of the scattering changes it using the exclusive or inclusive generalized @xmath1 algorithm .",
