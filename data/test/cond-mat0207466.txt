    "large sparse networks are the underlying structure for transportation or communication systems , both man made ( like computer networks  @xcite or power grids  @xcite ) or natural ( like neural networks  @xcite or biochemical networks  @xcite ) .",
    "these networks displays both randomness and some self - induced structure influencing the flow of transport and robustness against congestion or breakdown in the network .",
    "one of the most conspicuous structures among real - world communication networks is a highly skewed distribution of the degree ( the number of neighbors of a vertex )  @xcite .",
    "avalanching breakdown in networks where the edges or vertices are sensitive to overload is a serious threat for real - world networks .",
    "a recent example being the black - out of 11 us states and two canadian provinces the 10th august 1996  @xcite .",
    "recently the overload breakdown problem for vertices in growing networks with an emerging power - law degree distribution has been studied  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the overload breakdown problem when edges ( rather than vertices ) are sensitive to overloading .",
    "we use the standard model for such networks  the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model  @xcite , but with a maximum load capacity assigned to each edge .",
    "the load is defined by means of the betweenness centrality  a centrality measure for communication and transport flow in a network  @xcite .",
    "the procedure enables us to study overload breakdown triggered by the redistribution ( and increase ) of load in a growing network .",
    "this is in contrast to earlier models of cascading breakdown phenomena , all dealing with vertex breakdown , that has taken a fixed network as their starting point  @xcite .",
    "we represent networks as undirected and unweighted graphs @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the set of vertices , and @xmath2 is the set of unweighted edges ( unordered pairs of vertices ) .",
    "multiple edges between the same pair of vertices are not allowed .",
    "the standard model for evolving networks with an emerging power - law degree distribution is the barabsi - albert model . in this model ,",
    "starting from @xmath3 vertices and no edges , one vertex with @xmath4 edges is attached iteratively .",
    "the crucial ingredient is a biased selection of what vertex to attach to , the so called `` preferential attachment : '' in the process of adding edges , the probability @xmath5 for a new vertex @xmath6 to be attached to @xmath7 is given by  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the degree of the vertex @xmath7 .",
    "to understand the effect of preferential attachment , we will also investigate networks grown with a unbiased random attachment of vertices . without the preferential attachment the networks are known to have an exponential tail of the degree distribution  @xcite .",
    "the time @xmath10 is measured as the total number of added edges , which is different by factor @xmath4 from refs .",
    "@xcite where @xmath10 is defined as the number of added vertices .",
    "it should be noted that in very large communication networks , such as the internet , the users can process information about only a subset of the whole network . how this affects the dynamics of network formation",
    "is investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work we neglect such effects and assume linear preferential attachment .      to assess the load on the vertices of a communication network , or any network where contact between two vertices are established through a path in the network ,",
    "a common choice is the betweenness centrality  @xcite which often is seen as a vertex quantity but has a natural extension to edges @xmath11  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of geodesics between @xmath6 and @xmath14 that contains @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the total number of geodesics between @xmath6 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath17 is thus the number of geodesics between pairs of vertices passing @xmath15 ; if more than one geodesics exists between @xmath6 and @xmath14 the fraction of vertices containing @xmath15 contributes to @xmath15 s betweenness .    in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) the use of betweenness centrality as a load measure is given thorough motivations .",
    "these arguments are readily generalized to the case of edges sensitive to overloading : suppose that @xmath18 is the set of pairs of vertices with established communications through shortest paths at a given instant  @xcite .",
    "then let @xmath19 denote the load of @xmath11 defined as the number of geodesics that contains @xmath15 .",
    "then we assume the effective load to be the average @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an ensemble of @xmath18 .",
    "to proceed , we restrict @xmath21 according to : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is constant with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "this is to be interpreted that an element of @xmath21 is a set of @xmath25 pairs of distinct vertices chosen uniformly at random , and thus corresponds to the case where the number of established communication routes ending at a specific vertex in average increases with @xmath24 .",
    "this case can for example be expected in the early days of the internet where the launches of new sites made the users browse a larger average number of sites .",
    "the case where the users at average connects to an @xmath24-independent number of others is discussed in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "the largest approximation , when using the betweenness as a load measure , is probably that routing protocols of e.g.  the internet has implicitly implemented load balancing  @xcite .    to introduce overloading to the dynamics",
    "we assign a capacity , or maximum value , @xmath26 to the load , the same for each edge , and say that the edge @xmath15 is overloaded if @xmath27 . from the definition of @xmath21 we can see that our situation corresponds to having a maximum capacity on the betweenness centrality of the edges so that an edge is overloaded if @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is constant ) .",
    "if an edge is overloaded it is simply removed from the graph , and the betweenness recalculated , if then another edge becomes overloaded it is removed , and so on . if more than one edge is overloaded at a time we choose the one to remove randomly .",
    "multiple breakdowns during one time step defines a `` breakdown avalanche . ''      to measure the network functionality we consider three quantities  the number of edges @xmath30 , inverse geodesic length @xmath31 , and the size of the largest connected subgraph @xmath32 : for the original ba model the number of edges increases linearly as @xmath33 ( i.e.  one edge is added in unit time ) .",
    "but if an overload breakdown occurs in the system @xmath30 decreases , making it a suitable simplest - possible - measure of the network functionality . in a functional network a large portion of the vertices should have the possibility to connect to each other . in percolation and attack vulnerability studies of random networks",
    "one often uses @xmath32 to define the system as ` percolated ' ( or functioning ) , when the size of the largest connected subgraph @xmath32 scales as @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristic features of the ba model networks , as well as many real - world communication networks , is a less than algebraically increasing average geodesic length @xmath34 . as the average geodesic length is infinite when the network is disconnected (",
    "as could be the case when an overload breakdown has occurred ) we study the average inverse geodesic length  @xcite : @xmath35 which has a finite value even for the disconnected graph if one defines @xmath36 in the case that no path connects @xmath6 and @xmath14 . to monitor the fragmentation of the network",
    "we will also measure the number of connected subgraphs @xmath37 .",
    "for relative small @xmath4 , typical runs are exemplified in fig .",
    "[ ecacase ] . for both random and preferential attachment",
    "@xmath38 reaches a critical time where after the network starts to break down , eventually @xmath38 reaches a steady state value .",
    "the breakdown develops differently in the two cases : for the random attachment the breakdown is relatively slow and the steady state value is high compared to the preferential attachment case where large successive avalanches fragments the network .",
    "the other two quantities reflects the same behavior : while the initial vertices gets joined into the network @xmath31 increases to an early maximum .",
    "after the decrease corresponding to the increase of @xmath34 , @xmath31 decreases rapidly when the network becomes fragmented .",
    "@xmath30 shows the jagged shape , as expected correlated with that of @xmath38 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ ecacase](a ) and ( b ) , the discontinuity in @xmath30 ( in the preferential attachment case ) , is less pronounced than that in @xmath38 , so a small number of overloaded edges can be enough to cause large decrease in @xmath38 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that bridges ( single edges interconnecting connected subgraphs ) have a high betweenness and thus are prone to overloading .",
    "the number of connected subgraphs behaves qualitatively the same for random and preferential attachment . for other runs of the algorithm the breakdown",
    "can qualitatively be described as above .",
    "the averaged quantities varies relatively little , for example the peak - time for @xmath38 has a standard deviation of @xmath39% .    the corresponding overload case for vertices studied in ref .",
    "@xcite shows a similar time development with an period of incipient scale - freeness , an intermediate regime of breakdown and recovery ( although the period of recovery is not as large for edges as for vertices ) , and a final breakdown to a large-@xmath10 state of disconnected clusters .",
    "one major difference between overload breakdown for vertices and edges is that the difference between random and preferential attachment is larger for edge overloading  edge robustness benefits more than vertex robustness from the geometry arising from random attachment .",
    "next we investigate the @xmath4-dependence . as seen in fig .",
    "[ leca ] the system becomes more and more robust when @xmath4 increases .",
    "this is of course expected since with a higher average degree more edges shares the load , so the maximal load can be expected to decrease . for high enough @xmath4 there are no avalanches , the largest connected component remains of the same size @xmath40 . when @xmath40 the next edge attaching a new vertex will have @xmath41 , and thus be overloaded . in most cases",
    "this will lead to removal of the newly added edge  otherwise another edge has to be overloaded at the same time , which is decreasingly likely with increasing @xmath4 . in fig .",
    "[ leca](b ) we can see one exception to this interpretation at @xmath42 : here @xmath38 reaches @xmath43 but starts to decay slowly at around @xmath44 .",
    "as mentioned , the largest connected subgraph is expected to become more stable as @xmath4 increases . if there is an @xmath4 above which @xmath45 for arbitrary large @xmath10 above some @xmath46 is an open question . comparing fig .",
    "[ leca](a ) and fig .",
    "[ leca](b ) shows that random attachment and preferential attachment have similar @xmath4-dependence behavior  the major difference being that preferential attachment has a much sharper increase of @xmath38 ; to be more precise the @xmath4 values that does not reach @xmath40 for any @xmath10 , have a lower value in the large-@xmath10 limit .    to get another angle of the mechanisms of the breakdowns for small @xmath4",
    ", we consider histograms of degree @xmath47 and betweenness @xmath17 .",
    "[ ecahistk ] and [ ecahistb ] shows these histograms both before and after the large drop in @xmath38 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "( in the random attachment case this drop occurs at @xmath50 , the corresponding value for preferential attachment is @xmath51 . ) for random attachment the difference between the histograms before and after the @xmath38-drop is distinctively smaller than for preferential attachment , just as expected from fig .",
    "the random attachment curves in fig .",
    "[ ecahistk](a ) has a degree distribution of truncated exponential form both at the earlier and later times . in fig .",
    "[ ecahistk](a ) it is exponential over two decades of @xmath52 , but falls off faster than exponentially for higher @xmath47 . for preferential attachment the degree distributions ( fig .",

    "there is an emergent power - law shape of the @xmath52-curve , whereas at @xmath54 the shape is exponential , @xmath55 , over five decades . to summarize , the degree distributions before and after the @xmath38-peak illustrates the same behavior as the time evolution of @xmath38the breakdown in the preferential attachment case is both faster and more restructuring than in the random attachment case .",
    "the betweenness distributions of fig .",
    "[ ecahistb ] shows a peak that moves to higher @xmath56 , as @xmath10 grows , until it reaches its maximal value at the time of the drop in @xmath38 and starts to decrease . for random attachment ( fig .",
    "[ ecahistb ] ( a ) ) the shape of the distribution looks qualitatively the same before and after the drop , but for preferential attachment ( fig .",
    "[ ecahistb ] ( b ) ) @xmath57 for betweenness smaller than the peak .",
    "the vertex betweenness distribution of the ba model is known to be strictly decreasing  @xcite , which would imply that the low-@xmath56 tails in fig .",
    "[ ecahistb ]  ( b ) ( and most likely in fig .",
    "[ ecahistb ]  ( a ) as well ) comes from a spread of the size of the largest cluster , rather than from a tail in the largest cluster s betweenness distribution .",
    "another feature of the betweenness histograms of fig .",
    "[ ecahistb ] is the smaller peaks at low @xmath56 for @xmath53 .",
    "these peaks corresponds to a sharp peak of the cluster size distribution just after the @xmath38-peak ( see fig .",
    "[ ecahist2 ] ) .",
    "such smaller clusters have small average degree with many @xmath58 vertices , which all contributes to a peak at @xmath59 of the betweenness histograms .",
    "this explains the peak at @xmath60 in the @xmath61 curve of fig .",
    "[ ecahistb ]  ( b ) .    the distribution of cluster sizes displayed in fig .",
    "[ ecahist2 ] gives some further insights : for @xmath54 of the random attachment curves shows a bimodal distribution as @xmath62 is zero in the interval @xmath63 .",
    "the preferential attachment curves , in contrast , has a long tail . both the large @xmath59 peak for random attachment and the tail of preferential attachment corresponds to one single cluster .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the vertex overload case  @xcite where the network looses the unique largest component after the breakdown avalanches .",
    "as @xmath10 evolves well beyond @xmath64 the largest component peak decreases , and does thus not represent a giant component ( a largest cluster proportional to @xmath24 ) .",
    "the picture for both random and preferential attachment is thus that the system does not loose its unique largest cluster in a single breakdown avalanche ",
    "an avalanche rather results in a few isolated vertices or smaller clusters getting disconnected from the largest connected component .    the overall picture of the time evolution of @xmath38 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ ecacase ] ) , the @xmath4-dependence ( fig .",
    "[ leca ] ) , as well as the histograms of figs .",
    "[ ecahistk ] , [ ecahistb ] and [ ecahist2 ] is that for small @xmath4 , avalanching breakdowns fragments the network to a state from which it never recovers . for preferential attachment",
    "the newly fragmented network contains a single largest cluster with a well defined size , and the emergent scale - free degree distribution before @xmath64 is replaced by an exponential distribution .",
    "the breakdown for the random attachment case turns out to be less violent , and does not cause any major structural change .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the random and preferential attachment cases is larger for edge breakdown than for the corresponding vertex breakdown model studied in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have studied networks grown by the barabsi - albert model for networks with emergent scale - freeness and edges sensitive to overloading . except the preferential attachment defining the ba model",
    ", we also study an unbiased random attachment .",
    "we focus on the case where the number of established connections to random other vertices of the network scales linearly with the number of vertices in the network .",
    "we find that for intermediate values of @xmath4 ( the number of edges added per vertex ) the network grows like the ba model up to a point where is starts to break down . after a number of avalanching breakdowns the network reaches a state characterized by many disconnected clusters from which a giant component never re - emerges (",
    "although , in the preferential attachment case , there will always be one single largest cluster much larger than any other ) .",
    "if the growth is by random attachment , the breakdown is less violent with smaller avalanches and no pronounced structural change . for large @xmath4 the steady state at large times",
    "is characterized by a constant largest cluster size .    in context of real world communication networks",
    "one can conclude that these would benefit from being grown by random rather than preferential attachment ( and this difference being larger for edge overload than for vertex overload studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the vertex overload case avalanches proceeds until the network is fragmented into small clusters ; in the edge overload problem there is still one large component after the breakdowns , thus we infer that for real - world communication networks , vertex overloading is a greater threat than edge overloading , and congestion control in telecommunication networks  @xcite and internet routing protocols  @xcite should focus on balancing the vertex rather than edge load . only if the capacity of vertices ( servers etc . )",
    "grows significantly faster than the capacity for edges ( cables etc . )",
