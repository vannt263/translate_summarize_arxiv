    "we first created an accurate psf model image using the psf task of daophot in the iraf environment and then added 100 artificial stars per chip at random pixel coordinates using the addstar task in iraf .",
    "a series of images were produced for different input magnitudes at 0.5mag intervals .",

    "we report the discovery of the ultra - faint star cluster kim3 in the constellation of centaurus .",
    "it is a compact ( @xmath0 ) and extremely faint ( @xmath1 ) star cluster . although its physical size and ellipticity are comparable to segue3 , the new cluster exhibits even more asymmetry on the contour map than segue3 ( see figure 5 in * ? ? ?",

    ", kim3 is located @xmath88kpc above the galactic plane and therefore unlikely to be an old open ( disk ) cluster .    the cmd of kim3 in figure  [ fig : cmd ] appears to have a tight main - sequence , which implies the absence of binary stars with large mass ratios .",
    "this is in contrast with the observations of a strong anti - correlation between the fraction of binaries and the mass of the cluster  @xcite .",
    "such a low binary fraction is more likely to be observed in the outer region of gcs as the binaries preferentially occupy the central region .",
    "although the lack of a binary sequence in figure  [ fig : cmd ] might be the consequence of low number statistics , it implies that kim3 possibly originated from the outskirts of a more massive gc undergoing tidal disruption in the gravitational field of the milky way .",
    "high precision photometry and proper - motion measurements will be able to test this hypothesis .",
    "the half - mass relaxation time of kim3 is estimated as @xmath89myr based on our measurements of the structural parameters in section 3.3 and the equation ( 5 ) from  @xcite .",
    "as this time scale is significantly shorter than the observed age of kim3 ( @xmath2 gyr ) , it is highly likely that the cluster has been dynamically relaxed for a long time and bears evidence of mass segregation .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : contour ] already gives an impression of mass segregation in kim3 in the way that the majority of bright main - sequence stars between @xmath90 preferentially occupy the inner region of the cluster while the fainter , less massive ms stars mainly comprise the outer part of the cluster .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : massseg ] shows the @xmath26 magnitudes of the 22 stars in the magnitude interval @xmath91 consistent with the main - sequence of the best - fit isochrone in the cmd within two half - light radii ( @xmath76 ) as a function of radial distance from the center of the cluster .",
    "the lower panel shows the corresponding cumulative distributions for two different magnitude intervals ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , corrected for incompleteness .",
    "although it appears that the brighter ( or more massive ) main sequence stars are more common in the centre of kim 3 than in its outskirts , a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test implies that this seemingly mass - segregated state is not highly significant , yielding a formal probability of 87 percent that the two groups were sampled from populations with different parent distributions .",
    "this is possibly because of the relatively small sample sizes .",
    "the lack of a well defined center in the ultra - faint star cluster with an old stellar population also suggests that kim3 might have experienced substantial mass loss owing to tidal disruption in the gravitational field of the milky way ( see , e.g. , discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the small overdensity 9.7pc away from kim3 to the south , is likely a debris of the tidal disruption .",
    "we can use the centers of kim3 and the overdensity as reference points to determine the associated great circle . taking it as an approximation for the orbital path of kim3",
    ", we find that the two globular clusters @xmath94centauri ( @xmath95kpc ) and ngc5286 ( @xmath96kpc ) , which are @xmath97 and @xmath98 away from kim3 , are only @xmath99 and @xmath100 away from that great circle . in this context",
    "it is further interesting to note that these systems are among the few mw globular clusters showing internal variations in metals  @xcite , which led to the hypothesis they are surviving remnants of tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies .",
    "kim 3 may have originated from a more massive stellar system that also hosted ngc5286 or omega centauri .",
    "future radial velocity and proper motion measurements will help to test this idea ."
