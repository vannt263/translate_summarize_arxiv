    "the analysis of observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation , recently reported by the experiments boomerang and maxima-1 @xcite , confirmed that , at present - day , inflation @xcite still remains as the favourite model for the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "the main reason is that the currently obtained observational data on structures in the universe are interpreted in a natural way within the framework of the gaussian adiabatic and nearly scale - invariant density perturbations that the usual models produce . on the other hand ,",
    "it is one of the simplest paradigms within which rigorous theoretical predictions can be achieved .",
    "however , the inflationary paradigm is quite a broad one , and there are several equally satisfactory implementations of the inflationary idea .",
    "the simplest scenario arises when the dynamics of inflation ( both classical and quantum ) are dominated by a single scalar field ( inflaton ) evolving in a nearly flat potential . even in this case",
    ", there are a large number of candidates for the potential . for this scenario",
    "it is well established @xcite that , to a good approximation , the scalar and tensor perturbations will take on a power - law form , with the tensor ones giving a subdominant ( and almost negligible ) contribution .",
    "a way of discriminating between candidates for inflationary potential is the comparison between observed and predicted perturbations spectra .",
    "however , the present level of accuracy of the observations is well below the accuracy of the predictions for most of the models @xcite , allowing a large number of them to remain as candidates .",
    "another way of accomplishing the task of choosing a proper potential is to reconstruct it from the observed spectra @xcite , but again the low accuracy of measurements as well as the fact that the reconstruction is based on a taylor expansion of the potential ( with higher order derivatives given in dependence of the amount and quality of observational data ) , implies a large uncertainty in the outcomes of the standard reconstruction procedure , from the point of view of the potential uniqueness @xcite . anticipating the near - future launch of satellites capable of measuring microwave background anisotropies to an accuracy of a few percent or better , across a wide range of angular scales @xcite ,",
    "an assessment of the accuracy of predictions of the anisotropies for given cosmological models has been stressed .",
    "grivell and liddle @xcite have confirmed that for most models of inflation , the stewart and lyth analytic calculations @xcite should give extremely accurate predictions .",
    "lyth and stewart @xcite began with the precise calculation for power - law inflation @xcite and then they went on to use this exact result to analytically compute the next - order slow - roll correction to the standard formula @xcite . at this level of approximation ,",
    "the stewart and lyth equations for the spectral indices @xcite can be rewritten as nonlinear differential equations in terms of the first slow - roll parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hence , a third option for the determination of the inflationary potential , that we shall discuss in this paper , is to use observational information about density perturbations and gravitational waves spectra as input in these differential equations , to solve for @xmath0 and to find the corresponding inflationary potential .",
    "we call this procedure the stewart - lyth inverse problem .    in this work , after introducing the stewart - lyth inverse problem , we test the feasibility of the method by finding the proper potential for the well - known scenario of power - law inflation . nevertheless , the involved system of differential equations composed by a second order and a first order equations , have proved to be very difficult to solve for general functional forms of the perturbations spectra . taking this into account , in this paper",
    "we restrict our analysis to a qualitative study of the dynamics described by these equations . to draw conclusions about the behavior of the general solutions ,",
    "the equations are studied using the spectral indices as parameters . for the corresponding reduced equations",
    ", we analyze the phase space for the second order equation which presents a singularity that strongly determines the flow geometry .",
    "not cyclical orbits are found .",
    "the reduced first order equation is solved for any value of the tensorial spectral index and the possible behaviors are analyzed with all of the solutions being monotonic . except in the case of null tensorial index , the singularity is also observed . in general , for solutions of the stewart - lyth inverse problem with smoothly and slowly changing spectral indices , periodic , quasiperiodic , or chaotic general solutions should not be expected .",
    "the theoretical analysis as well as observations suggest that power - law solutions are still valid .    in the next section",
