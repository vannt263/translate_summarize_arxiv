    "micro- and nano - structured surfaces are frequently used to implement surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) , where interaction of the analyte with the substrate , mostly coupling between surface plasmons of the substrate and raman modes of molecules @xcite , lead to the multiplication of the raman signal intensity . controlling the sers enhancement , however ,",
    "has proven problematic due to the random plasmon distribution .",
    "nanovoids such as spheric cavities or grooves are known to host well - defined plasmon modes that interact strongly with incident laser light @xcite .",
    "it was thus proposed that nanovoids might be used to achieve tunable raman enhancement @xcite .",
    "one of the geometries that performs particularly well consists of an array of 1 @xmath0 m deep pyramidal pits of @xmath190opening angle @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this mesoscale geometry has reflecting surfaces of a distance that scales between a few wavelengths and sub - wavelength and thus resembles an ( unstable ) optical resonator .",
    "this raises the possibility that in this particular case the enhanced signal is generated by energy coupling into the raman active medium from a high energy standing wave , practically implementing a raman laser .",
    "while parallel mirror micro - resonators have been studied before @xcite , the tilted mirror geometry of the pyramidal pit requires a different formalism to account for diffraction and near - field effects .",
    "importantly , this geometry might be seen as a special case of an aperture ( with an infinitesimally small opening at the tip of the pyramid ) .",
    "light propagation through sub - wavelength apertures of various geometries is intensively studied due to the special properties of the optical near field , in particular , light localization and the accompanying intensity enhancement @xcite . while experimental evidence prooves its existence @xcite ,",
    "the origin of the intensity enhancement is ambiguous as some theories attribute it to the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons @xcite , others to intracavity ( waveguide ) resonances @xcite or other phenomena @xcite .",
    "while in the case of entirely sub - wavelength structures the comparable spatial distribution of plasmon- and diffraction - originated intensities prohibits an easy distinction , the dimensions of the pyramidal pit permit an attempt at the separation of the plasmon and diffraction effects .",
    "when assuming that the aperture is in a perfect conductor screen , in which the plasmon frequency is infinity , purely diffractive intensity distributions might be calculated .",
    "the formulation we used is based on the near field treatment by neerhoff and mur @xcite.*we intend to find if resonant enhancement does exist in a pyramid - type geometry , therefore * we approximate the pyramidal pit with a v - slit , thus reducing the dimension of the problem to a plane , a simplification that , at the moment , is necessary for the solution of the problem .",
    "importantly , the v - slit geometry is known to support standing waves as it can act as a waveguide ; this application was discussed in a number of studies .",
    "in this section we summarize briefly the formulation used . for further details on a similar model",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ config ] .",
    "the slit is parallel to the @xmath2 axis in a screen of thickness @xmath3 .",
    "the entrance width of the slit is @xmath4 , the exit width is @xmath5 ( in our case , @xmath6 ) .",
    "the geometry is divided into three regions : i ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , ii ) @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 and iii ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath12 .",
    "an incident plane wave propagating in the @xmath13 plane in region i arrives at the slit at an angle @xmath14 with respect to the @xmath15 axis .",
    "the time harmonic magnetic field is constant and at the same time polarized in the @xmath2 direction : @xmath16 in this case the electric field can be found from maxwell s equations , and the diffraction problem is reduced to one involving the single scalar field @xmath17 in eq .   in only two dimensions .    in the three regions the field",
    "is represented by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . due to time harmonicity",
    "the field satisfies the helmholtz equation . in region",
    "i the field is composed of three components : @xmath20 . here @xmath21 is the incident field which is assumed to be a plane wave of unit amplitude : @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "@xmath23 is the field that would be reflected without a screen : @xmath24 .",
    "finally , @xmath25 is the diffracted field produced by the presence of the slit .    for a perfectly conducting screen ,",
    "the tangential @xmath26 vanishes at the surface @xmath27 .",
    "further boundary conditions result from assuming that the diffracted fields and their derivatives vanish at infinity .",
    "the final boundary condition is the continuity of the field and its derivative at the upper and lower slit boundaries . to find the field ,",
    "the 2d green s theorem is applied with one function given by @xmath17 and the other by a standard green s function .",
    "we assumed that the tangential @xmath26 vanishes at the screen ; therefore more is known about @xmath28 at the boundaries than is known about @xmath29 itself .",
    "the green functions for the v slit geometry can be found in @xcite .",
    "the following boundary conditions are imposed on @xmath30 :    @xmath31    @xmath32 and @xmath33 must also satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition . using these assumptions and conditions",
    "we may evaluate the three green s functions . in regions",
    "i and iii we find    @xmath34,\\\\ g_3(x , z;x',z')=\\frac{i}{4}[h_0^{(1)}(k_3r)+h_0^{(1)}(k_3r'')],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath35    in region ii , the method of images can be used : @xmath36+h_0^{(1)}[k|\\vec{r } -\\vec{r_n''}|]\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 define a series of images reflected by the walls . the projection of an arbitrary point ( @xmath39 ) on the wall :    @xmath40    from this the coordinates of the mirrored point are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "a series of images of the original point might be generated with the rotation of the points by @xmath43 ( @xmath44 being the number of rotation ) .    by using the definitions of the green functions in the three regimes and the boundary conditions",

    "we solved the equations for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 numerically .",
    "we analysed the light diffraction in region ii for several laser wavelength in the range that is frequently used for raman spectroscopy .",
    "a typical result is shown on figure [ szamolasok1 ] for @xmath50  nm",
    ". similar resonant intensity enhancement was observed for all wavelengths .",
    "this enhancement is due to redistribution of electric charges ( i.e.  not plasmons ) on the screen surface leading to standing wave formation with enhanced amplitude .",
    "the presence of the standing waves confirms that the geometry acts as an optical resonator .",
    "another interesting feature is the formation of vortices in the cavity ( figure [ vectors ] ) .",
    "these vortices appear approximately at @xmath51 , where @xmath52 it is important to note that at the surface the electric field vectors are mostly parallel to the walls .",
    "thus , when considering the interaction with the raman active material , the enhancement of different modes should occur in comparison to plasmon - enhancement where the electric field is mostly perpendicular to the surface .",
    "far - field theory also predicts the standing waves and the vortices * ( fig .",
    "[ farfield ] ) * , however , a few remarkable differences justify the use of near - field theory . first , at the slit entrance ( @xmath53 ) a strong intensity suppression can be observed ( see figs .  [ poynting ] and [ vectors ] ) that can not be seen in the case of a macroscopic slit with the same geometry * ( see fig .",
    "[ farfield])*. notably , far - field diffraction theory used to calculate intensity distributions in macroscopic objects does not contain the diffractive component that causes the suppression .",
    "second , the maximum electric field occurs at the apex of the v - shape that confirms the observations of suzuki _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the energy flux : @xmath54 and @xmath15 components of the poynting vector are depicted in figure  [ poynting ] .",
    "it is important to note that , while the standing waves appear at distances that satisfy the @xmath55 criterium for the consecutive wavelengths , the values of intensity maxima of the standing waves are strongly wavelength dependent .",
    "this dispersion effect might influence the efficiency of raman - enhancement in these structures when using different laser wavelengths , and could be used for the experimental verification of the predictions of the calculations .",
    "note that enhancement at different wavelengths is not the same for electric field components and poynting vector components , e.g.  poynting vector shows notable enhancement for @xmath50  nm in comparison with @xmath56  nm or @xmath57  nm while for the same wavelength the maximal value of the electric field vector is the smallest .    in summary , theoretical analysis of light diffraction in a sub - wavelength to near - wavelength v - groove * in a perfect conductor screen",
    "* was performed by using near - field approach .",
    "it was shown that the geometry acts as an optical resonator where the intensity enhancement is determined by the near - field effects * * , i.e. without plasmons**. the field vectors form vortices around the intensity maxima , being mostly parallel to the walls of the groove , which determines the raman modes of surface bound molecules enhanced in this configuration .",
    "the intensity enhancement is wavelength dependent , thus different laser wavelengths might lead to different raman enhancement when using this geometry .",
    "comparison of results obtained with near - field and far - field approaches reveals that the near - field component is responsible for the observed dramatic intensity enhancement , and thus the raman enhancement as well .    * acknowledgement * am acknowledges the australian research council and the support of monash university through the monash fellowship scheme .",
