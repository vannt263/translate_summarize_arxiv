    "one of the most efficient methods of selecting high redshift galaxy candidates involves the detection of lyman break systems .",
    "this break comes from the likelihood of absorption due to intervening h i along the line of sight and  for many galaxies  also from the instrinsic continuum break in the spectrum of the galaxy ( bruzual & charlot @xcite ) .",
    "the search is done with two broad band filters that fork this break and a third one that is used to further ascertain the high redshift nature of the object . the work of steidel et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) imaging fields around high redshift quasars yielded many candidates , several of which have been spectroscopically confirmed to be galaxies at @xmath6 the advantage over previous unsuccessful narrowband lyman-@xmath7 surveys ( e.g. giavalisco et al .",
    "@xcite , martnez - gonzlez et al .",
    "@xcite ) is that a wide range in redshift can be surveyed . besides",
    ", the break in the spectrum can be easily discerned with broad band imaging , allowing the detection of normal high-@xmath8 galaxies , with a typical magnitude at a redshift of @xmath4@xmath9 of @xmath10 ( djorgovski @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the lyman-@xmath7 emission line can be weak or even non - existent as it appeared in many of the galaxies detected by steidel et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we found the field around quasar pc1643 + 4631a to be a good candidate for this technique for a couple of reasons : this @xmath0 qso has a damped lyman-@xmath7 system ( dls ) at @xmath11 ( schneider et al .",
    "@xcite ) whose lyman break would be perfectly positioned between johnson @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters . besides",
    ", a possible very massive cluster might exist between this quasar and a second one ( pc1643 + 4631b ) that lies just 200 arcsec away and has roughly the same redshift ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "jones et al .",
    "@xcite detected a significant decrement in the cmb in a region between these two qsos that could be related with a sunyaev - zeldovich effect arising from a m@xmath13m@xmath14 intervening cluster .",
    "however , saunders et al .",
    "@xcite imaged the region in @xmath3,@xmath15 and @xmath16 bands , looking for ellipticals that should abound in such a cluster , and found no evidence .",
    "the technique used in this paper is the best one to search for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath4  @xmath9 , thereby contributing to check this result : if such a massive cluster were to exist , a survey around pc1643 + 4631a should give a net excess of candidates towards the direction of the cluster .",

    "the observations were obtained in may 1996 using brocam2 at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) and in may 1997 using the william herschel telescope ( wht ) 4.2 m prime focus camera , both at the roque de los muchachos observatory , la palma , spain .",
    "both cameras used a thinned @xmath18 loral chip which is remarkable for its very high quantum efficiency even in the blue part of the spectrum , making it especially useful for @xmath1 band imaging .",
    "the image scale is @xmath19 and @xmath20 per pixel ( not and wht respectively ) .",
    "we also used a 30 minute exposure of the quasar in the @xmath3 band ( wht+tek ccd detector ) taken by saunders ..... , retrieved from the ing archive , which greatly helped us in achieving a homogenous limiting magnitude in all three bands .",
    "deep imaging was done through johnson @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 filters and reduced using the standard techniques of bias subtraction and flat fielding using iraf tasks .",
    "the long integration times required were separated into shorter  usually 1200 second  exposures , slightly nodding the telescope between them in order to be able to eliminate cosmic rays and bad pixels .",
    "these frames were eventually registered and combined into a final image using a clipping algorithm .",
    "the photometric calibration was achieved with images of standard stars ( landolt @xcite ) taken throughout the observing nights .    in order to detect candidates of galaxies at high redshift",

    "the search of objects in the final frames was performed using sextractor ( bertin e. @xcite ) , carefully tweaking the parameters to avoid such effects as excessive deblending or noise  dominated detections .",
    "the threshold was set at 16 connected pixels ( which is slightly smaller than the number of pixels inside the seeing disk ) with 0.75@xmath26 lower limit per pixel for a global 3@xmath26 detection per object .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on the objects using several aperture sizes to make sure we were collecting all the flux .",
    "it also gave us an idea of the uncertainty to expect with faint objects .",
    "finally , we chose a diameter of 12 pixels ( 3.2 arcsec ) to get the photometry and checked each candidate visually to make sure there was no problem with deblending , hot pixels or other spurious detections .",
    "this issue was further enforced by considering only candidates that appeared _ both _ in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 filter images .",
    "the size of the aperture was chosen taking into account the seeing of the images ( 11.5 arcsec ) and the fact that high@xmath8 candidates should be pointlike objects .    the photometry output from sextractor",
    "was further checked using several tasks from iraf from which we can extract a photometric uncertainty of 0.30.4 magnitudes for objects with @xmath27 .",
    "the candidates for high redshift galaxies were obtained using a color and magnitude constraint .",
    "the first and most important one is @xmath28 since it reveals the existence of a break in the spectrum at around 3650   which corresponds to the lyman continuum break at @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , there is also a very strong break at 4000   in the rest frame , especially prominent in old galaxies . hence , low-@xmath8 early",
    " types can sneak in our list .",
    "furthermore , we could also find galaxies with a strong emission line falling in the @xmath2 band and faking such a break .",
    "the way out of this degeneracy is twofold : we check an extra color towards the red side of the spectrum , namely @xmath24 , which can tell low redshift ellipticals or galaxies with strong emission lines from high redshift ones .",
    "we took @xmath29 .",
    "figure  [ model ] shows the color prediction for three different morphologies from the models of bruzual & charlot @xcite .",
    "notice how the degeneracy between high redshift late  type galaxies and low redshift ellipticals in the @xmath23 graph is removed when considering @xmath24 .",
    "an early  type galaxy has a steeper spectrum towards @xmath3 , thereby higher values of @xmath24 , whereas the lower bound in this color is chosen to avoid galaxies with strong emission lines which might fall in the @xmath2 band . besides the color constraints",
    ", we should also impose a limit on the apparent magnitude . even though the selection suffers from malmquist s bias",
    ", we do not expect to find galaxies with an intrinsic luminosity greater than a few @xmath30 , which implies rejecting candidates whose apparent magnitude is brighter than @xmath31 .",
    "part of the degeneracy may still remain because faint galaxies could still be identified with ellipticals at low redshift with an absolute luminosity around @xmath32 .",
    "however , the constraint in @xmath24 makes this choice less likely over a late  type high redshift galaxy .",
    "table 2 shows the list of candidates which appeared in our images imposing these constraints .",
    "all the objects with detections both in @xmath2 and @xmath3 are shown in figure  [ allobjs ] , whereas figure  [ objects ] plots a subsample of these objects with @xmath33 and shows the constraining color  color region where the candidates should lie .",
    "figure  [ objects ] also shows the confirmed candidates from steidel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who used the same technique although with a different set of filters , specifically designed for maximum efficiency at these redshifts .    finally , we considered the object that lies very close to the line of sight of the qso .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images show it as an elongation of the quasar towards the sw , but in the @xmath1 band it stands out clearly as the qso fades out of view . in order to perform the photometry in @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ", we subtracted the psf of a nearby point - like object scaled to the peak of the qso .",
    "this is just a rough estimate but it allows us to ascertain the nature of this object .",
    "we got @xmath34 ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it is rather bright in the @xmath1 band , which discards the possibility of it being the one responsible for the dls in the qso s spectrum at @xmath11 .",
    "the models fit these colors with a late  type galaxy at @xmath37 , which  for a @xmath38 , @xmath39 cosmology  gives an absolute luminosity of @xmath40 .",
    "this galaxy might possibly leave its imprint on the spectrum of the qso .",
    "among the many objects detected around pc1643 + 4631a , it is worth mentioning a group of them that are very red in @xmath23 but too bright to be high redshift galaxies .",
    "many of these objects were already detected by hu & ridgway ( @xcite ) , using a selection criteria in the red and nir part of the spectrum .",
    "they looked for objects which had a very red @xmath41 color , hence aiming at the detection of early  type galaxies and eros .",
    "the 19 objects listed in their work are shown in table 3 along with our photometry in @xmath1,@xmath2 and @xmath3 . combining both surveys we have photometry in 8 standard filters ( @xmath42 ) which can be used to determine the nature of some of these objects .",
    "most of them have very red @xmath23 and @xmath43 colors as well as relatively bright @xmath2 magnitudes , all evidence pointing at low redshift elliptical galaxies .",
    "the high density of these objects may plausibly imply the existence of a cluster . furthermore , radio  loud qsos",
    " such as pc1643 + 4631a  have a higher probability of being magnified by foreground matter ( i.e. an intervening cluster ) because of the double magnification bias ( bentez & martnez - gonzlez @xcite , schneider et al .",

    "the square difference between the actual and the predicted models is computed and the @xmath8 for which this difference reaches a minimum gives the estimated redshift .",
    "the letter in front labels the type of galaxy model that fits best : e and l for early and late type , respectively .",
    "objects # 10 and 14 can not be catalogued this way because they escape detection down to very faint magnitudes ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "they are very good candidates for eros and that prompted the observations of object # 10 doing deep ir imaging and spectroscopy ( graham & dey @xcite ) , finding  as expected  that it could not be an elliptical galaxy but rather an interacting system .",
