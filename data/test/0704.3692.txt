    "the langevin equation for an overdamped particle in a one - dimensional random potential presents a useful model for the study of a variety of the noise - induced and disorder - induced phenomena .",
    "specifically , it has been employed for describing anomalous diffusion in disordered media @xcite , glassy dynamics and depinning transition @xcite , diffusive transport in ratchets @xcite containing explicitly quenched disorder @xcite , carrier mobility in disordered solids @xcite , to name only a few main ones . moreover",
    ", this set - up enables a very simple description of the dynamics of domain walls in random magnets , dislocations in solids , and vortices in type - ii superconductors , effectively capturing all the essential effects of quenched disorder .",
    "the effects arising from quenched disorder are often unexpected and even counterintuitive .",
    "it therefore constitutes a prominent objective to study model systems for which _ exact _ statistical characteristics of the solution of the corresponding langevin equation can be obtained , not only at asymptotically large times but even at finite times of its evolution .",
    "exact results are very useful also for testing approximate methods of analysis of these systems .",
    "there already exists in the literature a number of exact results derived for systems with sinai disorder @xcite , gaussian disorder @xcite and non - gaussian disorder @xcite . in most of these cases",
    "the obtained results represent either the _ numerical _ characteristics of the solution of the langevin equation ( moments of the solution , moments of the first - passage time , etc . ) or the _ asymptotic _ probability distributions describing the long - time behavior of the solution . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , the _ exact time - dependent distributions _ of analytic form , allowing the study of the effects of quenched disorder in full detail , have not been given before .",
    "in this paper we solve the above - mentioned challenge for a special class of systems containing quenched _ dichotomous _ disordered and subjected to a constant bias force .",
    "more precisely , we derive and investigate the analytical expression for the probability density function of overdamped particles in a piecewise linear random potential driven by a constant force at zero temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii , we reduce the probability density to the form of a fourier integral",
    ". the first two moments of the probability density and their asymptotic expressions are calculated in sec .",
    "the time evolution of the probability density is studied both analytically and numerically within sec .",
    "v. here we also compare the analytical results with those obtained from direct numerical simulation and derive the asymptotic behavior of the probability density in the limits of small and large times . in sec .",
