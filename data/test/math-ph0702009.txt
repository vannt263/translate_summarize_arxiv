    "dynamics of a nonequilibrium system is one of the most stimulating topics in statistical mechanics .",
    "the dynamical property is determined by the interplay among various elements such as interaction , initial and boundary conditions , and so on . but little is known about how it depends on these elements and realizes universality in a situation where the elements are intertwined .",
    "the aim of this article is to approach such questions by analyzing the dynamics of the one - dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "the asep is one of the most typical models of interacting particle processes where particles diffuse to a preferred direction with hard core repulsive interaction  @xcite . in spite of the simplicity of the model",
    ", it has been known that the asep shows various interesting phenomena caused by the collaboration between the diffusion and exclusion effect .",
    "furthermore , in the one - dimensional case , it has an integrable mathematical structure which allows us to analyze some physical quantities exactly .",
    "for example , in the open boundary condition a steady state can be constructed using the matrix product method and @xmath0-orthogonal polynomials , and the boundary - induced phase transition can be discussed  @xcite .    on the other hand , the dynamical ( non - stationary ) properties of the one - dimensional asep",
    "have been also analyzed recently . among various studies on the topic , we focus on the problem of the diffusion of a particular particle in the one - dimensional asep .",
    "( we call the particle a _ tagged _ particle . )",
    "this is a fundamental and elementary problem for the understanding of the dynamics of the asep .",
    "we are interested in how initial conditions and the exclusion effect through hard - core repulsive interaction affect the diffusion property and how it is different from the ( normal ) diffusion of the brownian particle .",
    "the scaling exponent of the diffusion provides insights into these problems .",
    "it was found that it depends on the initial conditions . in a steady state with a given density , the position fluctuation of a tagged particle grows as @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the exponent 1/2 is the same as that of the brownian particle . on the other hand , for the fixed initial conditions where initially we create particles with a given density and fix the initial configuration , the exponent changes from 1/2 to 1/3  @xcite .",
    "such a diffusion is called an anomalous diffusion .",
    "this exponent 1/3 can be understood from the fact that the time evolution of the one - dimensional asep can be described by the one - dimensional kardar - parisi - zhang universality class  @xcite . in the study of the current in the one - dimensional asep on a ring ,",
    "the exponent 1/3 was calculated by the bethe ansatz technique  @xcite .",
    "note that the two cases above have a common property that the density is invariant under both time and space translation and a tagged particle moves with a fixed velocity on average . on the other hand , let us now consider another initial condition where all sites on the left of a certain bond are occupied while all right sites are empty .",
    "we call this initial condition a _ step _ initial condition .",
    "this is the typical initial condition where the density and the average velocity of a tagged particle change with time . under the initial condition",
    ", we focus on the @xmath2th particle from the right as a tagged particle and consider the time evolution of the particle when @xmath2 is large ( but finite ) . in order to study this problem",
    ", we investigate the limiting behavior of the diffusion of the tagged particle as both @xmath2 and time go to infinity . in the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) , where particles move only to the right , the average position of a tagged particle has been given in the scaling limit  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we are interested in the limiting process itself which the tagged particle obeys , as well as the average position and the scaling exponent .",
    "such an attempt as getting more sophisticated information than the scaling exponent has been recently discussed in the study on the current fluctuations in the tasep . not only the exponent but also the scaling function were obtained and it was revealed that the function is equivalent to the largest eigenvalue distribution in the random matrix theory with various universality classes .",
    "this development is based on the results on the longest increasing subsequence in a random permutation  @xcite .",
    "remarkable is that the scaling function detects a difference in initial conditions even if the scaling exponent does not .",
    "for instance , in the case of the step initial condition , the scaling function is equivalent to the gue tracy - widom distribution  @xcite , which is the largest eigenvalue distribution of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue )  @xcite . in other initial conditions , on the other hand ,",
    "these are described as the largest eigenvalue distributions with other universality classes in rmt such as gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe )  @xcite , two independent goe s which is denoted by goe@xmath3  @xcite , and so on  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the equal - time multipoint distribution of the current fluctuations is obtained in the step and periodic initial conditions  @xcite by use of the green function of the tasep  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we calculate the multi - time distribution function of position fluctuations of a tagged particle in the tasep with the step initial condition based on the techniques of the directed polymer problem in a 01 matrix  @xcite and stochastic growth of young diagram characterized by the schur process  @xcite .",
    "we express the function as the fredholm determinant and discuss the scaling limit by the saddle point analysis .",
    "we remark that what will be considered in this paper is the pointwise convergence of the kernel .",
    "the convergence of the fredholm determinant itself is certainly expected to hold from previous works on related problems @xcite , but more elaborate asymptotic analysis is necessary for its proof . in the study on the asep ,",
    "such correlations between different times have not been studied yet although the green function  @xcite and the equal - time joint distributions of particle positions  @xcite have been studied recently . in the one - time case ,",
    "on the other hand , the position fluctuation is essentially the same as the current fluctuation which has already been studied in  @xcite .",
    "but it has not been stated as the position fluctuation .",
    "furthermore , we also consider the dependence of the distribution function on defect particles located in front of the tagged particle . here",
    "defect particle means a particle with different hopping rate from other normal particles and we assume the number of them is finite .",
    "such a situation as the tasep with particle - dependent hopping rates has been recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we clarify that when their hopping rate is smaller than that of normal particles , the limiting behavior of the multi - time distribution changes due to their presence although their number is finite .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the definition of the model .",
    "the main result of this article is given in section  [ main ] .",
    "in section  [ ftts ] , we express the multi - time distribution of position fluctuations in the tasep as fredholm determinant . for this purpose , we first show that the directed polymer problem on a 01 matrix is related to the time evolution of a tagged particle in the tasep with the step initial condition .",
    "next , by applying the dual robinson - schensted - knuth algorithm to the 01 matrix , we map the tagged particle problem in the tasep to the stochastic growth of young diagram described by the schur process . in section  [ asymp ]",
    ", we discuss the two types of scaling limit for the multi - time distribution function , the case where both time @xmath4 and the label of the tagged particle @xmath2 tend to infinity , and the one where @xmath4 goes to infinity with @xmath2 fixed .",
    "some discussions and concluding remark are given in section  [ discussion ] and section  [ conclusion ] respectively .",
    "in this section , we define the model and the quantity which we study in this article .",
    "let us consider the one - dimensional infinite lattice and particles as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "each site can be occupied by at most one particle .",
    "suppose all particles are labeled an integer @xmath5 from the right",
    ". a particle moves stochastically obeying the following rules . during each time step between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the particle labeled @xmath5 hops to the right neighboring site with probability @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and stays at the same site with probability @xmath10 if the right neighboring site is empty . on the other hand , if the site is occupied by the particle labeled @xmath11 , the @xmath5th particle stays at the same site with probability 1 .",
    "this incorporates the exclusion effect which describes the hard core repulsive interaction .",
    "when hopping rates of all particles are the same , i.e. , @xmath12 , the system is the usual totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) with parallel update .",
    "we allow the particle - dependent hopping rates and study the effects of defect particles .    in this article , we consider the step initial condition in which all sites on the left of a certain bond between two sites are occupied by particles and all sites on the right of the bond are empty .",
    "1(b ) illustrates the initial condition .    under these settings , we label the particles at @xmath13 from the right ( see fig .  1(b ) ) and consider the dynamics of the particle labeled @xmath2 .",
    "( this particle which we focus on is called the tagged particle . ) for this purpose , we set the position coordinate such that the tagged particle is at the origin at time 0 as depicted in fig .",
    "let us define @xmath14 as the position of the @xmath2th particle at time @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , @xmath14 represents the distance travelled by the @xmath2th particle from time @xmath15 through @xmath4 .",
    "the quantity which we will investigate is the multi - time joint distribution function for @xmath14 defined as @xmath16 in particular , we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of   as @xmath4 goes to infinity . in this article , two types of scaling limit will be discussed .",
    "the first one is the limit where both time @xmath4 and the label of the tagged particle @xmath2 go to infinity with the ratio @xmath17 fixed . in the second one ,",
    "on the other hand , we take the @xmath18 limit with @xmath2 fixed .    in order to see how the whole particles from the first to @xmath2th travel",
    ", we performed the numerical simulation of which the result is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we considered the time evolution of the particles from the first to 100th and assumed the hopping rate of all particles is 0.9 except the first , 25th , 50th and 75th particles whose hopping rate is 0.8 .",
    "thus these four particles represent the defect particles .",
    "the typical example of the time evolution of the 100 particles from time 0 through 3000 is illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) . in this figure ,",
    "the vertical axis represents the position coordinate introduced in fig .",
    "1(b ) , whereas the horizontal axis is time axis , and each particle is expressed as @xmath19 . from the macroscopic point of view such as fig .",
    "2(a ) , we only find that they travel in a group .",
    "however , if we zoom the configuration of the particles in a certain time zone , we can see the microscopic pattern of the configuration . here",
    "we show two characteristic configurations which are depicted in fig .",
    "2(b ) and 2(c ) .",
    "2(b ) ( resp.(c ) ) represents the configuration of the particles when time is around 200 ( resp .",
    "3000 ) . when the time zone which we focus on is early enough as in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the particles move forming only one group and the four defect particles are included in the group .",
    "on the other hand , when time has passed sufficiently as in fig .",
    "2(c ) , they form the four groups automatically and the top of each group is the defect particle .",
    "the similar platoon structure was also discussed in the study of the tasep with disordered hopping rates  @xcite .",
    "in fact , as will be explained in the next section , the position fluctuation of a tagged particle also changes with time corresponding to the change of the configuration .",
    "our whole discussions in this article are based on a fact that the tagged particle problem for the step initial condition has a nice combinatorial structure which admits us to obtain a closed expression for the multi - time joint distribution in the form of the fredholm determinant .",
    "the results are summarized in the following theorem .",
    "the proof will be presented in section  [ ftts ] .",
    "note that due to the rule of the tasep , the particle labeled @xmath2 can not move when @xmath20 .",
    "thus , throughout the article , we consider the multi - time function   under the condition @xmath21    * theorem 1 *    _ _    when holds , @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the fredholm determinant defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the kernel @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 in   and   denotes a contour enclosing the origin anticlockwise with radius @xmath29 and @xmath30 in   satisfy the conditions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "using the results in theorem 1 , one can study the asymptotics of the joint distribution . in this subsection",
    ", we consider the scaling limit such that both @xmath4 and @xmath2 go to infinity with their ratio @xmath34 fixed .",
    "@xmath35 represents the scaled time .",
    "notice that we also take the limit of the label of the tagged particle @xmath2 .",
    "this may sound strange if the particle we are focusing on is varied as @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "rather we think that the results below give the asymptotic behaviors of the path statistics of the tagged particle for large but finite @xmath2 which is fixed . alternatively one might be able to interpret them as giving the asymptotic behaviors of the path statistics of the tagged particle near a large but finite @xmath4 .",
    "we also discuss the effect of defect particles .",
    "in particular , we consider the situation where there are finite @xmath36 defect particles with stay rates @xmath37 in front of the tagged particle . for this purpose , we set the stay rate @xmath10 of @xmath5th particle as follows . for some set @xmath38 with",
    "@xmath36 fixed , we assume @xmath39 note that the particle with the rate @xmath40 represents the defect particle whose label is @xmath41 whereas the remaining particles with the rate @xmath0 are the normal particles .      the average position of the tagged particle divided by @xmath2 has a deterministic limit as @xmath33 .",
    "let us call it @xmath42 , @xmath43 we also define @xmath44 .",
    "( note that @xmath45 is the stay rate of the slowest defect particle . )",
    "if @xmath46 , which is the case where the slowest defect particle is slower than the normal particles , we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 can be understood from theorem 1.1 . in  @xcite .",

    "@xmath42 is illustrated in fig .",
    "next we consider the position fluctuations of the tagged particle around the average position .",
    "there are four typical regions shown in fig .",
    "3 . in each region , we can obtain the result on the position fluctuations by focusing on a point within the region and taking a proper scaling around the point .",
    "note that in fig .  3 , the regions 2 and 4 spread in the form of a line whereas the regions 1 and 3 are point - like . thus , in the region 1(resp .",
    "3 ) , we always consider the fluctuation property around the point @xmath54 ( resp .",

    "one easily finds that the arrival time can be scaled as in   which is the same scaling as the central limit theorem .    applying the scaling to theorem 1",
