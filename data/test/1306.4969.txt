    "several features of atomic nuclei @xcite and neutron stars @xcite are determined by this quantity and one of the major tasks of recent experimental and theoretical investigations is to determine a consistent density parametrization of the symmetry energy which can provide a unified picture of nuclear properties below saturation as well as at large compression of asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation facilities at ganil , gsi , msu and riken , allowing for the study of very neutron rich systems , stimulated new investigations along this direction . in this context , understanding the exotic modes of excitation @xcite and the role of the neutron skin on the collective dynamics in nuclei far from stability is a challenge in modern nuclear physics @xcite . indeed , several experiments performed during the past 10 years reported the occurrence of an electric dipole ( @xmath8 ) response well below the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , more clearly evidenced in neutron rich nuclei @xcite , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent overviews .",
    "it manifests as a resonant - like shape exhausting few percentages of the dipolar energy wighted sum rule ( ewsr ) and its controversial nature attracted a considerable interest for theory too @xcite .",
    "the pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) was interpreted as a collective motion in phenomenological , hydrodynamic descriptions @xcite , in nonrelativistic microscopic models @xcite or in transport models @xcite . also in a relativistic microscopic approach @xcite it was observed that the dipole spectra of even - even ni and sn isotopes show two well - separated collective structures ,",
    "the lower one being identified with pygmy resonance , consistent with previous results based on relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite .",
    "other studies , however , associate the concentration of strength to the contributions from single - particle type excitations excluding coherent , collective properties @xcite .",
    "it is possible that in the low - energy region the dipolar response manifests both single - particle and collective features .",
    "moreover , a fragmentation of the @xmath8 response is expected to determine a weakening of the collectivity @xcite .",
    "a promising approach aiming to clarify the nature of pdr as well as the role of the symmetry energy and the neutron skin is based on a systematic analysis of the influence of the neutron excess on observables as the energy centroid or the low - energy @xmath8 strength . following this approach ,",
    "several experimental investigations have been focused on the study of ca @xcite , ge @xcite , and mo @xcite isotopes as well as of @xmath9 @xcite , and @xmath10 isotones @xcite . from the measurements for stable sn isotopes @xcite and neutron - rich systems @xmath11sn , and @xmath12sb @xcite , a trend of strength increasing with the neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath13 was reported .",
    "a threshold value of the isospin @xmath14 , beyond which a sizable fraction of the pygmy strength appears , was related to the skin development @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to address the connection between the development of the neutron skin and the emergence of a low - energy @xmath8 response in relation with the symmetry energy density dependence , a subject under intense debate during the past few years .    theoretically , in a semi - phenomenological description using a hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) treatment within the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite for the neutron - rich sn isotopes from @xmath15sn to @xmath16sn ,",
    "it was stressed that the concentration of @xmath8 strength , evidenced between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , can not be considered a low - energy tail of gdr .",
    "the corresponding states , having a genuine character with a dominance of neutron excitations , were considered noncollective .",
    "the evolution of the strength distribution and of the energy location was closely related to the features of neutron mantle enclosing the more isospin symmetric core .",
    "however , in a non - relativistic rpa treatment @xcite for zirconium isotopes , the investigation of the role played by the neutrons in excess has shown that these strongly contribute to the @xmath8 excitation at about 8.5 mev and make it collective . moreover",
    ", the analysis @xcite of neutron and proton contributions to pdr , based on a non - relativistic self - consistent hf+rpa approximation , indicates that the pattern of the pdr changes with the increasing neutron number , becoming a quite collective resonant oscillation of the neutron skin .",
    "it was noticed a large collectivity of low - energy dipole states in @xmath19ni and @xmath16sn displaying a mixed isovector - isoscalar motion .",
    "piekarewicz @xcite raised the important question if a strong correlation between the neutron skin and the low - energy @xmath8 strength can be distinguished .",
    "for sn isotopes , within a relativistic rpa model , he concluded that the fraction of ewsr acquired in the energy region between @xmath20 and @xmath21 manifests a linear dependence with the neutron skin size up to mass @xmath22 followed by a mild anticorrelation .",
    "however , such strong correlation was questioned in ref .",
    "the authors introduced an investigation based on a covariance analysis aimed to identify a set of good indicators that correlate very well with the isovector properties and suggested that the low - energy @xmath8 strength is very weakly correlated with the neutron skin while the dipolar polarizability should be a much stronger indicator of isovector properties .",
    "this intriguing finding was challenged recently @xcite in the relativistic rpa approach with mixed results . a strong correlation between the neutron skin thickness of @xmath23pb and the dipole polarizability of @xmath19ni",
    "was indeed reported . but a strong correlation was also claimed between the skin thickness of @xmath23pb and low - energy @xmath8 features , including the strength and dipole polarizability associated to the pygmy mode , identified in @xmath19ni as exhausting about @xmath24 of the ewsr .    here",
    "we shall address these controversial issues , proposing an investigation based on a semiclassical transport model . because the neutron skin is an isovector indicator",
    ", we employ three different parametrizations with the density of the symmetry term and perform a comparative study in a model based on the landau theory of fermi liquids where the dynamics of the nucleons is described by landau - vlasov kinetic equations . in this paper",
    "we first explore the properties of the neutron skin and its sensitivity to the density dependence of symmetry energy .",
    "then we determine the @xmath8 strength function and study the mass dependence of the pdr peak .",
    "finally , we estimate the ewsr exhausted by the pdr and discuss its relation with the neutron skin thickness .",
    "since , as in the case of gdr , the evolution with mass of the low - energy @xmath8 response provides an additional insight upon the nature of the mode , we shall consider the systems @xmath25ca , @xmath19ni , @xmath26kr and @xmath23pb , as well as a chain of sn isotopes , @xmath27sn .",
    "having as main ingredients the fermionic nature of the constituents and the self - consistent mean - field , the vlasov equation represents the semiclassical limit of time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) and , for small - oscillations , of the rpa equations . while the model is unable to account for effects associated with the shell structure , our self - consistent approach is suitable to describe robust quantum modes , of zero - sound type , in both nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "it provides important information about the dynamics of such collective modes , allowing for a systematic study over an extended mass and isospin domain . in this context",
    "we notice that in a tdhf study with a skyrme interaction @xcite a pygmy like peak was identified for the deformed @xmath28 mg at around 10 mev . from time - dependent density plots",
    "it was recognized as a superimposed surface mode not fully coupled to the bulk motion .",
    "similarly , studies based on landau - vlasov equations were also inquiring on the collective nature of pdr @xcite and on the role of the symmetry energy on its dynamics @xcite .",
    "it was observed that , as in the tdhf investigation , a pygmy like collective motion in @xmath16sn manifests .",
    "moreover , it was found that the symmetry energy does not affect the energy centroid but influences the ewsr acquired by it .",
    "the two coupled landau - vlasov kinetic equations for neutrons and protons : @xmath29 , \\label{vlasov}\\ ] ] determine the time evolution of the one - body distribution functions @xmath30 , with @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "in the following we shall switch - off the collision integral but we have tested that the results are not strongly influenced , as expected , when it is included .",

    "concerning the density dependence of the symmetry energy , we consider , in the mean - field structure , different parametrizations of @xmath41 . while keeping the value of symmetry energy at saturation almost the same",
    ", we shall allow for three different dependencies with density away from equilibrium .",
    "for the asystiff equation of state ( eos ) @xmath41 is constant , @xmath42 mev",
    ". then the symmetry energy @xmath43 at saturation takes the value @xmath44 mev while the slope parameter @xmath45 is @xmath46 mev .",
    "the asysoft case corresponds to a skyrme - like , skm * , parametrization with @xmath47 , which leads to a small value of the slope parameter @xmath48 mev .",
    "last , for the asysuperstiff eos , @xmath49 , the symmetry term increases rapidly around saturation density , being characterized by a value of the slope parameter @xmath50 mev .",
    "the integration of the transport equations is based on the test - particle ( or pseudoparticle ) method , with a number of @xmath51 test particles per nucleon in the case of sn isotopes , ensuring in this way a good spanning of the phase space .",
    "this method is able to reproduce accurately the equation of state of nuclear matter and provide reliable results regarding the properties of nuclear surface @xcite and ground - state energy for finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "since in the next section we shall explore the possible correlations between the properties of pdr and the neutron skin , we present here the predictions of the model for the neutron and proton distributions for different asy - eos . from the one - body distribution functions one obtains the local densities : @xmath52 as well as the quadratic radii @xmath53 and the width of the neutrons skin @xmath54 .    an efficient method to extract the values of @xmath55 and @xmath56",

    "as expected , the neutron skin thickness increases with the slope parameter @xmath69 , an effect related to the tendency of the system to stay more isospin symmetric even at lower densities when the symmetry energy changes slowly below saturation , as in the case of the asysoft eos .",
