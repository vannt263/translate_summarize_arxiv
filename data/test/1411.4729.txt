    "electrophoresis of charged colloids and polyelectrolytes has been studied theoretically and experimentally for several years@xcite .",
    "electrophoresis is employed in numerous engineering applications such as the separation of polyelectrolytes and coating by electrophoretic decomposition .",
    "smoluchowski presented the most well - known model .",
    "he argued that the mobility of a charged spherical colloid is given by @xmath0 in the thin - double - layer limit , where @xmath1 is the mobility , @xmath2 is the dielectric constant of the solutions , @xmath3 is the electrostatic potential at slip surfaces , and @xmath4 is the viscosity of the solutions@xcite .",
    "later , henry pointed out the retardation effect@xcite .",
    "the electric field is distorted by spherical colloids and the distortion suppresses the electrophoretic mobility .",
    "obrien and white found nonlinear dependencies of the electrophoretic mobilities on @xmath3 for thin double layers in contrast to the smoluchowski equation @xcite .",
    "they considered a sufficiently weak electric field and linearized kinetic equations for the field ( weak - field linearization ) .",
    "this nonlinear behavior is due to the polarization of the electric double layer and surface conduction . on the other hand , in the case of polyelectrolytes , hermans and fujita proposed a new equation for mobility ( see eq .",
    "( [ hermansfujita]))@xcite .",
    "this equation ignores the double - layer polarization and surface conduction , and is derived using the debye - hckel approximation and weak - field linearization .",
    "these nonlinear effects on the electrophoresis of polyelectrolytes have been recently studied @xcite .",
    "classical studies on electrophoresis consider the immobile electric charges fixed by chemical bonds to surfaces or polymer backbones .",
    "recently , a new type of electrophoresis that is attributed to other charges , such as induced charges on conductive particles , was reported@xcite . in this type of electrophoresis ,",
    "an external electric field leads to nonuniform @xmath3 potentials and induces electro - osmotic flow . when a particle possesses asymmetries , such as a partially insulator coating and nonspherical shape , the resulting asymmetric flow drags the particle to one direction .",
    "another example is a cation - selective conductive sphere . due to concentration polarization",
    ", the particle migrates under a uniform field@xcite .",
    "electrophoresis of drops , bubbles , and metal drops has also been intensively studied@xcite .",
    "regardless of the no - fixed charge on their bodies , they can migrate under an applied field .    in this paper",
    ", we examine electrically neutral polymers .",
    "however , mobile ions have selective affinity to the polymers .",
    "the selective affinity of ions to polymers originates from ion - dipole interactions@xcite .",
    "the contributions of selective affinity to phase separation , precipitation , and phase transition are quite strong@xcite .",
    "brooks reported that ion - polymer interaction affects the electrophoretic mobility@xcite . moreover",
    ", selective affinity of ions affects electro - osmosis in polyethyleneglycol - coated capillaries@xcite .",
    "et al . _  reported that the electrically neutral polymer polyestersulfon in butanol and dimethylformamide mixtures accumulate on the anode when an electric potential difference is applied between the electrodes@xcite .",
    "because butanol is a protonic solvent , a small amount of ions remains in the dispersions .",
    "in addition , the monomeric unit of polyestersulfon contains dipoles .",
    "the resulting selective affinity of the ions to the neutral polymer may lead to finite electrophoretic mobility .    in this study",
    ", we propose a new mechanism for the electrophoresis of neutral polymers in solutions containing mobile ions .",
    "the proposed model is based on electrohydrodynamics , and we include the effects of selective affinity by considering constant interaction energies between ions and spheres . because the model for selective affinities is based on assumptions , analytical expressions would not be able to quantify the mobilities .",
    "however , analytically calculating the mobility using a simple model is very helpful to show the possibility of migration .",

    "the amount of each ion species is the same because of the charge neutrality of the system .",

    "polymers have dipoles in their monomeric unit , and the interactions between the dipoles and ions in solution are strong ( see fig .  [ illustration1](b ) ) .",
    "the strength of the interaction depends on the radii of the ions and the dielectric constant of the solvent ; therefore , the ionic concentration in the porous sphere is possibly different from the outer concentration .",
