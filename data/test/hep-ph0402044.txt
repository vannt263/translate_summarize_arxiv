    "the existence of exotic baryons containing four quarks and an antiquark in their lowest fock component has now a solid experimental support .",
    "the observation of a narrow peak at 1.54 @xmath5 0.01 gev/@xmath6 , called @xmath0 , as an @xmath7 baryon resonance in the photo - production from neutron @xmath8 @xcite , has been confirmed by several groups in various photo - nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "this has been followed by the observation in @xmath9 collisions @xcite of other narrow resonances @xmath2 and @xmath10 at about 1862 mev , from which @xmath2 is interpreted as another pure exotic member of an su(3 ) flavour antidecuplet .",
    "the work of diakonov , petrov and polyakov @xcite has played a particularly important role in these discoveries . in the context of a chiral soliton model they predicted a narrow pentaquark , with a width of less than 15 mev , located at the about",
    "experimentally observed mass of @xmath11 .    at the end of the 70 s ,",
    "following the observation of several signals , light pentaquarks were studied theoretically @xcite , but these signals were not confirmed . charmed pentaquarks with strangeness , @xmath12 and @xmath13 were also predicted @xcite , but experimental searches carried at fermilab have remained inconclusive @xcite .",
    "these pentaquarks were introduced in the context of the one - gluon exchange model ( colour - spin interaction ) and the heavy ones carried negative parity . on the other hand",
    "positive parity pentaquarks containing heavy flavours were proposed in the context of a pseudoscalar exchange model ( flavour - spin interaction ) @xcite about ten years later @xcite . in this model , the lowest ones , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , do not carry strangeness .",
    "recently the h1 collaboration at desy @xcite reported a narrow resonance of mass 3099 mev , interpreted as a @xmath14 pentaquark .",
    "the spins and parities of @xmath0 and @xmath2 are not yet known experimentally . in this new wave of pentaquark research ,",
    "most theoretical papers take the spin equal to 1/2 .",
    "the parity is more controversial . in chiral soliton or skyrme models",
    "the parity is positive @xcite . in constituent quark models",
    "it is usually positive . in the present approach ,",
    "the parity of the pentaquark is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angular momentum associated with the relative coordinates of the @xmath18 subsystem .",
    "we analyze the case where the subsystem of four light quarks is in a state of orbital symmetry @xmath19}_{o}$ ] and carries an angular momentum @xmath17 = 1 .",
    "although the kinetic energy of such a state is higher than that of the totally symmetric @xmath20}_{o}$ ] state , the @xmath19}_{o}$ ] symmetry is the most favourable both for the flavour - spin interaction @xcite and the colour - spin interaction @xcite . in the first case",
    "the statement is confirmed by the comparison between the realistic calculations for positive parity @xcite and negative parity @xcite , based on the same quark model @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the antiquark was heavy , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , and accordingly the interaction between light quarks and the heavy antiquark was neglected , consistent with the heavy quark limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite an attractive spin - spin interaction between @xmath23 and the light quarks was incorporated and shown that a stable or narrow positive parity @xmath24 pentaquark can be accommodated within such a model .",
    "this interaction has a form that corresponds to @xmath25 meson exchange @xcite and its role is to lower the energy of the whole system .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to perform dynamical calculations of all the members of the antidecuplet to which @xmath26 and @xmath27 are supposed to belong . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first attempt in this direction .",
    "the present study is a natural extension of ref .",
    "@xcite where the heavy antiquark @xmath21 or @xmath22 is now replaced by a light quark @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 . to describe the short range interaction we rely on the same model @xcite as that used in @xcite .",
    "that means that the quark - quark interaction has a flavour - spin structure @xcite and that the parameters are fitted to the light non - strange and strange baryon spectra .",
    "moreover we assume that the quark - antiquark interaction is proportional to a spin - dependent operator , but it is flavour independent , as in ref",
    "its role is to introduce the same flavour independent shift for each member of the pentaquark antidecuplet of equal spin .",
    "we shall fix this shift by adjusting the mass of @xmath0 to the experimental value .",
    "there is no other free parameter in the hamiltonian model used in this study . for the pure exotic @xmath2",
    ", we predict a mass of 1960 mev . for the antidecuplet members with @xmath31 = 1 and 0 we investigate the role of the octet - antidecuplet mixing .",
    "to some extent this study will be a comparative one .",
    "we search for a variational solution of a five - body hamiltonian , containing a kinetic energy term , a confinement term and a short range ( hyperfine ) interaction having a flavour - spin structure .",
    "the su@xmath32(3 ) breaking is taken into account by the strange quark mass which appears in the mass term , in the kinetic part and in the hyperfine part .",
    "the latter also breaks su@xmath32(3 ) through the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons exchanged among quarks .",
    "the hamiltonian has the form @xcite @xmath33 with the linear confining interaction @xmath34 and the flavour  spin interaction @xmath35 the analytic form of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) is    @xmath39    with the parameters : @xmath40 which lead to a good description of low - energy non - strange and strange baryon spectra .",
    "fixing the nucleon mass at @xmath41 = 939 mev , this parametrization gives for example @xmath42 = 1232 mev and @xmath43 = 1493 mev .",
    "the lowest negative parity states appear at @xmath44 = 1539 mev , i. e. above the roper resonance , in agreement with the experiment .",
    "we start with the @xmath18 subsystem and treat the quarks as identical particles in all cases . then following ref .",
    "@xcite the orbital ( o ) part of the lowest totally antisymmetric state must carry the symmetry @xmath19}_{o}$ ] . in the flavour - spin ( fs )",
    "coupling scheme this state has the form @xmath45_o   { \\left[{211}\\right]}_{c } \\left[{1111}\\right]_{oc}\\ ; [ { 22}]_{f } [ 22]_{s } [ { 4}]_{fs }   \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] which means that the wave function is totally symmetric in the flavour - spin space and totally antisymmetric in the orbital - colour ( oc ) space and that the @xmath18 subsystem carries non - zero angular momentum and has zero spin .",
    "then the @xmath46 state is obtained by coupling the antiquark to the state @xmath47 of eq.([state1 ] ) which leads to either @xmath48 or to 8@xmath32 and to a total spin 1/2 . to derive the orbital part we denote the quarks by 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 and the antiquark by 5 and introduce the internal jacobi coordinates    @xmath49",
    "the key issue is to construct a wave function with correct permutation symmetry in terms of the above jacobi coordinates .",
    "assuming an @xmath50 structure for @xmath19}_{o}$ ] , the three independent @xmath19}_o$ ] states denoted by @xmath51 are @xcite    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55 are shell model wave functions and we took the quantum number @xmath56 = 0 everywhere , for convenience .",
    "thus each function carries an angular momentum @xmath57 = 1 in one of the relative coordinate , which leads to a total parity @xmath58 = + 1 and a total angular momentum @xmath59 = 1/2 or 3/2 .",
    "the degeneracy of these two states can be lifted by the introduction of a spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the functions ( [ psi1])-([psi3 ] ) are used to construct a totally antisymmetric orbital - colour state for the @xmath18 subsystem , in agreement with ( [ state1 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients of the resulting linear combination are fixed by group theory , namely by the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the permutation group s@xmath60 . in this case , the absolute value of all three coefficients is equal to @xmath61 , which means that each of the states ( [ psi1])-([psi3 ] ) contribute with equal probability .",
    "the pentaquark orbital wave functions are obtained by multiplying each @xmath51 by @xmath62 which describes the motion of the @xmath18 subsystem relative to @xmath63 . the wave function associated to each relative coordinate",
    "is chosen to be a gaussian .",

    "the algebraic structure of the state ( [ state1 ] ) is identical to that of ref .",
    "the small overlap of the resulting @xmath75 state with the kinematically allowed final states could partly explain the narrowness of @xmath0 .",
    "the expectation values of the hyperfine interaction @xmath76 , eq .",
    "( [ vchi ] ) , in the flavour - spin space , are presented in table [ fourq ] for the three @xmath18 subsystems necessary to construct the antidecuplet .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the two - body radial form ( [ radial ] ) now denoted as @xmath77 where @xmath78 specifies the flavour content of the interacting pair .",
    "the su(3)@xmath32 is explicitly broken by the quark masses and by the meson masses . by taking @xmath79 = @xmath80 = @xmath81 and @xmath82 = @xmath83 = 0 , one recovers the simpler model described in ref .",

    "one can see that , except for the confinement contribution @xmath100 , all the other terms break su(3)@xmath32 , as expected : the mass term @xmath101 increases , the kinetic energy @xmath102 decreases and the short range attraction @xmath103 decreases with the quark masses . for reasons explained in the introduction ,",
    "we subtract 510 mev from the total energy e in order to reproduce the experimental @xmath0 mass .    for completeness ,",
    "in the last two columns of table [ fiveq ] we also indicate the values of the variational parameters @xmath68 and @xmath72 appearing in the radial wave function ( [ psi0 ] ) which minimize the energy of the systems displayed in the first column .",

    "this is in contrast to the strongly correlated diquark model of jaffe and wilczek @xcite , where @xmath27 lies about 100 mev below the experimental value .",
    "note that the mass of @xmath0 is also fixed in that model . in the lowest order of su(3)@xmath32 breaking , one can parametrize the result by the gell - mann - okubo ( gmo ) mass formula , @xmath108 . in the present case one",

    "the masses of the physical states , the `` mainly octet '' @xmath127 and the `` mainly antidecuplet '' @xmath93 , result from the diagonalization of a 2 @xmath128 2 matrix in each case . accordingly the nucleon solutions are @xmath129 with the mixing angle defined by @xmath130 the masses obtained from this mixing are 1451 mev and 1801 mev respectively and the mixing angle is @xmath131 , which means that the `` mainly antidecuplet '' state @xmath93 is 67 % @xmath95 and 33 % @xmath132 , and the `` mainly octet '' @xmath127 the other way round .",
    "the latter is located in the roper resonance mass region 1430 - 1470 mev .",

    "@xcite at 1493 mev with the parameters ( [ param ] ) and assigned to the roper resonance .",
    "a mixing of the @xmath133 and the @xmath75 states could possibly be a better description of reality .",
    "there is some experimental evidence that two resonances , instead of one , separated by about 100 mev , and located around 1440 mev , could consistently describe the @xmath134 and @xmath135 scattering in this region @xcite , however .",
    "thus the issue of the existence of more than one resonance with @xmath136 in the 1430- 1500 mev mass range remains unsettled .",
    "the `` mainly antidecuplet '' solution at 1801 mev is far from the higher option of ref .",
    "@xcite , at 1730 mev , interpreted as the @xmath31 = 1 narrow resonance partner of @xmath0 .    in a similar way",
    "we obtain two @xmath111 resonances , the `` mainly octet '' one being at 1719 mev and the `` mainly antidecuplet '' one at 2046 mev .",
    "the octet - antidecuplet mixing angle is @xmath137 .",
    "the lower state is somewhat above the experimental mass range 1630 - 1690 mev of the the @xmath138 resonance .",
    "as the higher mass region of @xmath111 is less known experimentally , it would be difficult to make an assignement for the higher state .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath139 and @xmath140 are nearly equal in absolute value , but they have opposite signs .",
    "the reason is that @xmath141 while @xmath142 .",
    "interestingly , each is close to the value of the ideal mixing angle @xmath139 = 35.26@xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "only the relative strengths of decays and selection rules can discriminate between mixing schemes as well as between models @xcite .",
    "this is a task for a future work .",
    "in conclusion we have used a variational method , which provides upper bounds on the masses of all isomultiplets of the pentaquark antidecuplet .",
    "we calculated dynamically the masses of the pure exotic pentaquarks @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the masses of the other members of the antidecuplet .",
    "the model on which these calculations are based reproduces well the baryon spectrum , when baryons are described as @xmath133 systems .",
    "it assumes a flavour - spin structure for the hyperfine quark - quark interaction and its radial shape contains parameters which have been fitted not only to the ground state baryons , but also to a large number of excited states @xcite .",
    "in particular this interaction places the roper resonance , modeled as a @xmath133 system , below the lowest negative parity baryons , in agreement with the experiment .",
    "however the description of strong decays in this model is not satisfactory ( see e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . besides the @xmath145 interaction",
    "a @xmath146 interaction is necessary to describe pentaquarks .",
    "here we did not introduce it explicitly but relied on the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that an attractive spin - spin interaction that operates only in the @xmath146 channel can lower the @xmath75 energy to accommodate the @xmath0 . in this way we can explain the mass shift of -510 mev necessary to reproduce the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that this flavour - independent interaction equally lowers all the other members of the antidecuplet and of the octet .",
    "but in the new light shed by the pentaquark studies , the usual practice of hadron spectroscopy is expected to change .",
    "there are hints that the wave functions of some excited states might contain @xmath147 components . these components ,",
    "if obtained quantitatively , would perhaps better explain the widths and mass shifts in the baryon resonances @xcite .",
    "in particular the mass of the roper resonance may be further shifted up or down . in that case",
    "the model parametrization should be revised and more precise four- and five - body calculations should be performed . on the other hand",
