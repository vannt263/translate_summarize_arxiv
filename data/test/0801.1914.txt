    "very recently there has been a lot of interest in generalizations of the central limit theorem ( clt ) @xcite and on their possible ( strict or numerically approximate ) application to systems with long range correlations @xcite , at the edge - of - chaos @xcite , nonlinear dynamical systems the maximal lyapunov exponent of which is either exactly zero or tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit ( increasingly large systems ) @xcite , hindering this way mixing and thus the application of standard statistical mechanics . a possible application of nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite has been advocated in these cases .",
    "along this line we discuss in the present paper a detailed study of a paradigmatic _ toy model _ for long - range interacting hamiltonian systems @xcite , i.e. the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model which has been intensively studied in the last years . in a recent article @xcite , we presented molecular dynamics numerical results for the hmf model showing three kinds of quasi - stationary states ( qss ) starting from the same water - bag initial condition with unitary magnetization ( @xmath0 ) . in the following",
    "we present how the applicability of the standard or @xmath1-generalized clt is influenced by the different microscopic dynamics observed in the three classes of qss .",
    "in general , averaging over the threee classes can be misleading .",
    "indeed , the frequency of appearence of each of these classes depends on the size of the system under investigation , and there is no clear evidence that a predominant class exists .",
    "the hmf model consists of @xmath2 fully - coupled classical inertial xy spins ( rotors ) @xmath3 , with unitary module and mass @xcite .",
    "one can also think of these spins can as rotating particles on the unit circle .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath4~~ , \\label{eq.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the angle and @xmath7 the conjugate variable representing the rotational velocity of spin @xmath8 .",
    "+ at equilibrium the model can be solved exactly and the solution predicts a second order phase transition from a high temperature paramagnetic phase to a low temperature ferromagnetic one @xcite .",
    "the transition occurs at the critical temperature @xmath9 which corresponds to a critical energy per particle @xmath10 .",
    "the order parameter is the modulus of the _ average magnetization _ per spin defined aa @xmath11 . above @xmath12 ,",
    "the spins are homogeneously distributed on the circle so that @xmath13 , while below @xmath12 , most spins are aligned , i.e. rotors are trapped in a single cluster , and @xmath14 .",
    "the out - of equilibrium dynamics of the model presents very interesting dynamical anomalies . for energy densities @xmath15 $ ] , special classes of initial conditions such as those called _",
    "water - bag _",
    ", characterized by an initial magnetization @xmath16 and uniform distribution of the momenta , drive the system , after a violent relaxation , towards metastable qss . the latter slowly decay towards equilibrium with a lifetime which diverges like a power of the system size @xmath2 @xcite .    along the qss regime",
    ", in the microcanonical ensemble , the dynamics exhibits a glassy behavior , hierarchical structures , velocity correlations , aging , vanishing lyapunov exponents , etc . ,",
    "and the statistical description of the qss is strongly dependent on the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "however , even for the same type of initial conditions , we have observed different dynamical behaviors @xcite .",
    "in particular we have found three typical classes of events , as illustrated in fig . 1 . here",
    "we plot the temperature of the system ( defined as twice the average kinetic energy per particle ) versus time .",
    "we focused on a system with size @xmath17 , the energy per particle being @xmath18 , for which anomalies are more evident .",
    "initial conditions were chosen to be of the water - bag kind , with initial magnetization equal to unity ( @xmath0 ) . for details about the accuracy of the calculations and the integration algorithm adopted see ref.@xcite .",
    "only single events are plotted in fig .",
    "1 , each one representative of a given class .",
    "one immediately realizes that there are two extreme events ( which we indicated with 1 and 3 ) and an intermediate one ( indicated as 2 ) which stays close to event 1 at the beginning , but collapses towards the plateau of the event 3 after some time .",
    "the relative frequency of occurrence of these three classes of events is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 as a function of the size @xmath2 of the system . a total of @xmath19 realizations for each @xmath2 was considered .",
    "it is important to note that the event of class 3 shown in fig .",
    "1 , and all the events of class 3 in general , are very similar to the qss obtained for initial conditions with zero initial magnetization ( @xmath20 ) , which are almost homogeneous and have very small correlations @xcite . in this case",
    "a lynden - bell kind of approach , or one based on the vlasov equation has been applied @xcite .",
    "therefore , due to the different nature of these qss , which have in general different microscopic correlations , one could expect a different result for the central limit theorem behavior shown in refs .",
    "in this section , following the prescription of the clt and the procedure adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite , we construct probability density functions ( pdf ) of quantities expressed as a finite sum of stochastic variables and we select these variables along the deterministics time evolutions of the @xmath2 rotors . more formally , we study the pdf of the quantity @xmath21 defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , are the rotational velocities of the @xmath25-rotor taken at fixed intervals of time @xmath26 along the same trajectory obtained integrating the hmf equations of motions .",
    "the product @xmath27 gives the total simulation time over which the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) is calculated . as stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the variables @xmath21 s are also proportional to the _ time average _ of the velocities along the single rotor trajectories ( in fact the @xmath28 scaling is not necessary , and has been adopted just to conform to usage ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we show how the shape of the @xmath21 s pdf is affected by the existence of different classes of events in the qss of the hmf model .",
    "we consider the same system of the previous section with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath0 initial conditions .",
    "then we plot the pdfs corresponding to the three different events shown in fig .",
    "1 , the sum ( [ eq.3 ] ) being calculated over all the qss extension with @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( for a total time of @xmath31 steps , after a transient of @xmath32 , see orizontal arrow in fig.1 ) .",
    "all the curves were normalized to their standard deviations in order to compare them ( notice that , as done in @xcite , in the eq .",
    "( [ eq.3 ] ) we do not subtract an average value calculated over the trajectory and all rotors as in @xcite since it is not important due to this kind of normalization ) . in case of no global correlations , as one would expect at equilibrium , the standard clt holds and the resulting pdf should be a gaussian ( reported as dashed line for comparison ) .",
    "this fact has been verified for the equilibrium case in @xcite .",
    "actually this is also what happens for the event 3 ( full circles ) and it is most probably due to its similarity with the homogeneous qss recalled in the previous section . on the other hand ,",
    "if one considers the event 1 ( gray histogram ) , strong deviations from the gaussian behavior appears , meaning that global correlations become important . in this case",
    "a very good fit is obtained with a @xmath1-gaussian defined as @xmath33^{1/(q-1 ) } } \\ , ,    \\label{eq.4}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is a normalizing constant , which coincides in fact with @xmath35 .",
    "an excellent fitting corresponds to @xmath36 @xmath37 ( full line ) , a result very similar to those discussed in refs .",
    "finally , the pdf of event 2 ( full triangles ) lies between the previous two , being ( within the time interval that has been observed ) neither gaussian nor @xmath1-gaussian but a sort of mixture of them , due to the presence of a double qss plateau in the temperature evolution of this event .",
    "this new scenario , where both gaussian and @xmath1-gaussian attractors appear in the qss of a given system , implies that , if an average of the @xmath21 s is performed on many realizations , the particular mixture of the three kinds of events discussed here will affect the resulting pdf , in particular for sizes of the system greater than @xmath38 ( i.e. when the relative frequency of events of class 3 becomes important ) . in this respect",
    ", such a scenario also qualifies the context within which the results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite are to be considered , which is thus not general , especially for large system sizes .    as a further remark , in fig .",
    "4 we test the robustness of the behavior observed in fig .",
    "3 for events 1 and 3 . we repeated the calculations on the same events of fig . 3 , but with a different time interval @xmath26 .",
    "in the figure we report the cases @xmath39 ( a ) and @xmath40 ( b ) .",
    "one can see that changing @xmath26 and @xmath41 in the calculation of the @xmath21 s unaffects the pdf s shape corresponding to those events , providing that the total simulation time ( i.e. the product @xmath27 ) remains unchanged . in this figure , the same gaussian and @xmath1-gaussian curves of fig .",
    "3 are plotted again for comparison .",
    "it is important to notice that , for the case @xmath17 discussed in this article , we did not study in detail the behavior of the clt for the events of class 2 . in this case",
    "one could probably distinguish a first time evolution , closer to events of class 1 , from a final time evolution closer to events of class 3 .",
    "in the present case , however , the first part of the plateau is too short to allow the investigation of the clt behavior .",
    "the latter can probably be done for systems of larger sizes : we leave this study for the future .",
    "however , there is another difficulty which is intrinsic with the events of this class .",
    "in fact they exhibit a general strong variability as shown in fig . 5 , where we plot the temperature time evolution for several different events of class 2 for the case @xmath17 .",
    "although the qualitative behavior with a double plateau is the same , the temperature of the initial plateau can vary . in this respect",
    "a more detailed investigation is in progress .    before concluding",
    ", we would like to illustrate that the clt behavior observed for the events of class 3 for @xmath0 initial conditions is equivalent to that observed for any typical event with initial conditions @xmath20 . in fig .",
    "6 we plot the clt behavior for @xmath20 in comparison with the case @xmath0 for class 1 events , previously reported in fig .",
    "the gaussian pdf obtained for the case @xmath20 is comparable with what obtained in fig . 3 for the events of class 3 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed a clear inequivalence between time averages and ensemble averages . in fig .",
    "7 , we show that this inequivalence persists also for different initial conditions and classes .",
    "the ensemble averages of velocities are considered at time @xmath42 inside the qss over 10 events .",
    "the pdfs plotted in panels ( a ) and ( b ) are to be compared with the time averages curves shown in panel ( a ) of fig . 6 , while those plotted in panels ( c ) and ( d ) are to be compared with the time averages curves of events 1 and 3 of fig .",
    "3 . a gaussian ( dashed curve ) with unitary variance and a @xmath1-gaussian with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( full curve )",
    "are also reported for comparison .",
    "it is clear that the curves in fig .",
    "7 are neither gaussian nor q - gaussians .",
    "on the basis of the new calculations presented here , one should distinguish among different classes of qss for a given size of the hmf system .",
    "our tests do confirm that correlations can be different for different dynamical realizations of the same system , starting from the same class of initial conditions , and therefore also the central limit theorem behavior can change . according to the class considered we can have a gaussian pdf , a @xmath1-gaussian one or a mixture between the two . in this respect ,",
    "the presence of a @xmath1-gaussian curve confirms the results previously published about the indications for a generalized clt in long - range hamiltonian systems when ergodicity is broken and correlations are strong enough .",
    "the present results , where we verify that the time evolution of the system is quite sensitive to the specific initial conditions , reminds what occurs in other anomalous systems , like the hydrogen atom as studied recently in refs .",
    "we have checked also that inequivalence between time averages and ensemble averages continues to hold within the different classes for @xmath0 and for @xmath20 initial conditions .",
    "finally , although it is true that the frequency of occurrence of events of class 1 and 2 for very large sizes , and in particular the attractor for the events of class 2 , remain to be investigated with more accuracy ( calculations with better statistics are in progress ) before advancing definitive conclusions , from these simulations one could conjecture that the events of class 1 tend to disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , even if this was the case , their probability of occurrence ( as well as the probability of occurrence of the first metastable plateau of events of class 2 ) can be significantly different from zero for large but finite systems and therefore the applicability of @xmath1-statistics in metastable states of real complex systems remains a valid and interesting possibility .",
