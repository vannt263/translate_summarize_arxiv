    "in the study of liquid state physics , the structure of the liquid , which is often described primarily by the two body radial distribution function ( rdf ) , has always played a central role .",
    "the structure can not only describe the thermodynamic properties of the liquid like the energy and pressure , under certain theoretical frameworks like the mode coupling theory the structure can also determine the dynamics @xcite . in a series of paper berthier and tarjus have described the behaviour of two systems with different interaction potentials , namely , the lennard - jones ( lj ) and the weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potentials . although at the same temperature and density the structures of these systems are very close , the dynamics display significant differences at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "these studies questioned the role of structure in determining the dynamics .",
    "coslovich has shown that although the two body radial distribution function of these two systems are quite similar , triplet correlations are significantly different @xcite .",
    "he has also shown that the lj system has more pronounced local ordering @xcite . in supercooled liquids these locally preferred structures",
    "are known to form correlated domains which have been argued to give rise to the slow dynamics @xcite .",
    "an estimation of this length scale of the domains and its connection to the relaxation timescale is a topic of ongoing research @xcite .",
    "one such study by hocky _",
    "_ has shown that the point - to - set correlation length of the lj system is larger compared to that of the wca system and that this difference in correlation length can account for the difference in dynamics of the two systems @xcite . from these studies",
    "one may conclude that the difference in dynamics primarily comes from many body correlations . however ,",
    "in a recent study by some of us it has been shown that two body correlation information is good enough to capture the difference in the dynamics between the two systems .",
    "the study also reveals that the divergence temperature at which an approximation to the configurational entropy using pair correlation alone goes to zero , is similar to the mode coupling theory ( mct ) transition temperature , @xmath0 @xcite . as mentioned before",
    ", mct is a microscopic theory where the structural inputs determine the dynamics .",
    "although entropy and dynamics are related _ via _ phenomenological rosenfeld @xcite and adam - gibbs ( ag ) @xcite relations at high and low temperatures respectively , mct does not have any apparent connection to entropy .",
    "thus it is of great interest to try to understand the origin of the coincidence of the mct divergence temperature and the temperature where pair configurational entropy goes to zero .    at normal liquid temperatures ,",
    "a semi quantitative correlation between the dynamics ( transport properties ) and thermodynamics ( excess entropy ) , proposed by rosenfeld @xcite , has been extensively studied in recent times , where the relaxation time @xmath1 can be written as , @xmath2 \\label{rosenfeld}\\ ] ]    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the constants . since the pair entropy @xmath5 , which is obtained only from the pair correlation function , accounts for @xmath6 of the excess entropy @xcite ,",
    "many simulation studies have replaced @xmath7 by @xmath8 and have shown that even with @xmath8 the transport coefficients follow rosenfeld scaling @xcite .",
    "bagchi and coworkers used zwanzig s rugged energy landscape model of diffusion @xcite and by connecting the ruggedness to the excess entropy have provided a derivation of rosenfeld relation @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown that under certain approximations the diffusion coefficient as obtained from mct follows rosenfeld scaling .",
    "das and coworkers have performed microscopic mct calculations which show that the diffusion values thus obtained can be fitted to rosenfeld scaling @xcite .",
    "some of these studies have reported that the scaling parameter is not unique , hence the whole temperature region can not be fitted to a single straight line @xcite .",
    "although rosenfeld scaling holds at high temperature , it is known to breakdown at low temperatures even with multiple scaling parameters . at low temperatures the correlation between the transport coefficients and entropy",
    "is usually described by the well known adam - gibbs relation @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the configurational entropy of the system . for a wide range of systems ,",
    "the ag relation is found to hold @xcite below a moderately high temperature referred to as the onset temperature of slow dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the connection between dynamics , characterization of structure as contained in the pair and higher order correlations , and entropy , and relations between them as described by mct and the ag relation , using computer simulations of two model liquids and analytical results that seek to relate descriptions of dynamics in terms of structure , and entropy .",
    "our present study shows that the ag theory , which is based on activation dynamics can completely describe the mode coupling theory ( mct ) power law behavior in the region where the latter is found to be valid .",
    "an earlier study also observing similar overlap region @xcite argued that the observation supports the hypothesis that a direct relation exists between the number of basins and their connectivity @xcite . in this work to understand the above mentioned observations , we explore the connection between mode coupling theory ( mct ) and entropy and discuss different predictions of mct in the light of entropy .",
    "we also analyze the different roles of pair and many body correlations .",
    "although mct makes predictions about dynamics in both rosenfeld and ag temperature regimes , no connection between mct and entropy has been argued for , except for one study @xcite , as mentioned earlier .",
    "we show that , under some assumptions , the memory function in the mct equation for structural relaxation is related to the pair excess entropy , thus providing a microscopic derivation of the phenomenological rosenfeld expression for the structural relaxation time , @xmath1 .",
    "our study also can explain the origin of the temperature dependence of the rosenfeld parameter .",
    "the origin of higher relaxation time and higher activation energy as predicted by mct is also obtained from the analysis of the memory function .    as mentioned above the ag expression for relaxation times and the mct power law form overlap in a certain temperature regime .",
    "the ag relation is valid for a wide temperature range which includes the range in which the mct power law prediction holds .",
    "thus in the mct regime , the relaxation time follows both the ag and mct behaviour .",
    "our study reveals that the origin of the avoided divergence like behaviour ( as given by mct power law ) in the ag relation is related to the vanishing of the pair configurational entropy .",
    "however we show that the pair configurational entropy , although predicting the correct mct transition temperature , by itself can not predict the mct power law behaviour .",
    "the residual multiparticle entropy ( rmpe ) plays an important role in providing the correct temperature dependence of relaxation times .",
    "we also find a connection between the ag coefficient ( a ) , pair thermodynamic fragility ( @xmath11 ) and mct critical exponent ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we show that although both ` a ' and @xmath11 are dependent on density , their ratio which is related to @xmath12 is density - independent .",

    "vii contains a discussion of presented results and conclusions .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the kob - andersen model which is a binary mixture ( 80:20 ) of lennard - jones ( lj ) particles and the corresponding wca version @xcite .",

    "we have calculated the relaxation times from the decay of the overlap function q(t ) , using @xmath38 .",

    "this approximation has been shown to be a good approximation to the full overlap function .",
    "so , the self part of the overlap function can be written as , @xmath42    the @xmath43 function is approximated by a window function @xmath44 which defines the condition of `` overlap '' between two particle positions separated by a time interval t : @xmath45    the time dependent overlap function thus depends on the choice of the cut - off parameter a , which we choose to be @xmath46 .",
    "this parameter is chosen such that particle positions separated due to small amplitude vibrational motion are treated as the same , or that @xmath47 is comparable to the value of the msd in the plateau between the ballistic and diffusive regimes .",

    "the self intermediate scattering function is calculated from the simulated trajectory as @xmath53    since relaxation times from @xmath54 and @xmath48 behave very similarly at low temperature we have used the time scale obtained from @xmath54 . as @xmath54 can not be calculated from mct , at high temperatures where we compare the simulation result with the relaxation time obtained analytically from mct we have computed relaxation time using @xmath48 .",
    "we measure the partial structure factor @xmath55 which are needed as input for the mct calculations .",
    "they are defined as @xmath56      many properties of a glass forming liquids can be explained by the well known mode coupling theory of the glass transition ( mct ) .",
    "this microscopic theory can give a qualitative description of dynamical properties ( such as temperature dependence of relaxation time ) if the static structure of the liquid is known and many experiments and simulation results has shown that mct predictions hold good in the temperature regime of initial slow down of dynamics @xcite . the equation for the intermediate scattering function @xmath57",

    "the temperature dependence of the system enters in mct through s(q ) and since we need very precise s(q ) near the mct transition , we simulated s(q ) at three temperatures around the transition point and used them to create the structure factors at intermediate temperatures by quadratic interpolation method as described in @xcite .    to solve the eq.[fskt - eqn ] we need @xmath57 as an input , which can be taken by solving eq.[fkt - eqn ] .",

    "vibrational entropy is calculated by making a harmonic approximation to the potential energy about a given local minimum .",

    "as the liquid is supercooled , the rosenfeld scaling , observed to be valid at normal temperatures , is known to break down @xcite . however , in this regime the adam - gibbs relation is found to hold @xcite .",
    "the adam gibbs relation explains the behaviour of dynamical property like relaxation time using configurational entropy which is a thermodynamical property .",

    "we have tabulated the @xmath12 values in table [ gamma_a_kt2 ] , which shows the above relation holds . the deviation of slope value ( ` m ' ) from unity for wca system at @xmath93 may have some connection to its breakdown of density - temperature scaling which needs to be investigated in future .    the mct critical exponent ( @xmath12 ) is known to be density - temperature independent @xcite .",
    "interestingly we also find that although both ag coefficient ( a ) and pair thermodynamic fragility ( @xmath11 ) are strongly dependent on density and temperature ( table [ a_value ] ) , but their ratio , which is related to @xmath12 ( eq.[gamma_a_kt2_eq ] ) , is density - temperature independent ( table [ gamma_a_kt2 ] ) .",
    "in this work we show that in a certain region @xmath94 the relaxation time follows both the ag relation and mct power law behaviour .",
    "we also find that the mct divergence temperatures coincide with the temperature where pair configurational entropy goes to zero for all the systems studied here .",
    "ag relation is based on activated dynamics , whereas mct is mean field theory which at the two body level does not address any activated dynamics .",
    "also the microscopic mct does not have any apparent connection to entropy .",
    "thus to understand the above mentioned observations we explore the connection between mode coupling theory and entropy and discuss different predictions of mct in the light of entropy .    in this article",
    "we show that the mct vertex for the structural relaxation time under certain approximations can be related to the pair excess entropy .",
    "higher order mct calculations in the schematic mct framework can relate the relaxation time to the exponential of this vertex .",
    "thus the mct can provide a microscopic derivation of the phenomenological rosenfeld theory .",
    "our analysis shows that the rosenfeld parameter is related to the static structure factor @xmath95 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath95 leads to the temperature dependence of rosenfeld parameter ` k ' , thus explaining the earlier observation of the non - uniqueness of the rosenfeld exponent @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the vertex reveals that quantity which contributes to the vertex , @xmath96 has a much lower value and stronger temperature dependence as compared to the excess entropy , @xmath7 .",
    "if we assume the rosenfeld scaling to be valid and replace @xmath7 by @xmath97 , the predicted relaxation time shows similar characteristics as the mct relaxation time .",
    "thus the study reveals that the larger value of @xmath67 and its higher activation energy is related to the value and temperature dependence of the vertex .",
    "this analysis further reveals that the breakdown of mct at low temperature might be partially related to the strong temperature dependence of the vertex .",
    "as mentioned earlier the ag theory which is based on activation dynamics can completely describe the mode coupling theory ( mct ) power law behavior in the region where the latter is found to be valid .",
    "since the configurational entropy has a finite value at the mct transition temperature , @xmath86 , the ag relation is not expected to predict any avoided transition in this regime .",
    "our study reveals that although @xmath69 is finite , @xmath70 vanishes at @xmath85 ( where @xmath98 ) , thus being responsible for the divergence like behavior .",
    "however we show that the pair configurational entropy although predicts the correct mct transition temperature it by itself can not predict the mct power law behaviour .",
    "the residual multiparticle entropy ( rmpe ) plays an important role in providing the correct temperature dependence of relaxation time .",
    "we also obtain a connection between the ag coefficient ( a ) , pair thermodynamic fragility ( @xmath11 and mct critical exponent ( @xmath12 ) and found although first two quantities are dependent on density and temperature , their ratio which is related to @xmath12 , is density - temperature independent .    note",
    "that although the absolute value of @xmath99 is in the similar range both at high and low temperature regimes , in the high temperature regime it plays a minor role in determining the dynamics , whereas its role at low temperature becomes central as we approach the avoided transition .",
    "this small positive value of @xmath99 playing an important role in predicting the mct power law behaviour is similar to the prediction of unified theory @xcite . in the unified theory",
    "it was shown that in a certain temperature regime many body activated dynamics plays a hidden but central role in predicting the mct like behaviour of the total relaxation time .",
    "although apparently the mct does not depend on the properties of landscape , the saddles in the landscape have been found to disappear at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "here we show that @xmath70 also vanishes at @xmath0 .",
    "thus there may be a connection between pair configurational entropy and saddles",
    ". it will be also interesting to understand the independent role of pair configurational entropy and rmpe in the landscape picture .",
