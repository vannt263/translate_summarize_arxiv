    "@xcite associate the hyades stream feature with 4-fold symmetric orbits in the potential of a long - lived 2-arm spiral .",
    "such orbits arise near the ultra - harmonic ( 4:1 ) resonance of a finite amplitude perturbation , where stars make four radial oscillations in a single turn about the galaxy in a frame that rotates with the potential .    in all these studies ,",
    "the spiral waves are put in `` by hand '' , as externally applied perturbations with properties of their choosing .",
    "the supposed spiral waves should , of course , have arisen from the stars themselves as self - consistent collective disturbances , and therefore the properties of the waves assumed by these authors may not be completely realistic . in particular , their assumed shapes and time - dependence may bias crucial resonant interactions with the stars , which are responsible for the substructure they seek to explain .",
    "however , the distribution in velocity space , which these various authors attempt to mimic , is not the best projection of phase space to reveal the origin of the structure .",

    "i will here assume that the vertical motion of the disk stars is decoupled from their in - plane motion , or equivalently that the vertical action , @xmath29 , is adiabatically invariant .",
    "this is justified because the vertical oscillation frequency , @xmath30 , of stars that do not climb to great heights above the disk plane is rapid compared with the motion of the star in the plane .",
    "this assumption also requires that there are no resonances between the vertical motion and rotating non - axisymmetric structures . for disk stars whose departures from circular motion are not too large",

    "i choose @xmath45 at the apocentre of a star s epicycle and @xmath46 at the azimuthal location of the sun .",
    "this procedure implies two major assumptions .",
    "first , the milky way rotation curve is locally flat ; adjustment for a different potential would merely distort the distribution of stars in the space of these variables as points on a stretched rubber sheet .",
    "second , i have assumed an axisymmetric potential , whereas the milky way certainly has at least mild non - axisymmetry : the large majority of stars in the  sample have orbits that do not take them more than @xmath47kpc from the orbit of the sun , and most stay much closer .",
    "this range of distances is large enough for them to experience some non - axisymmetric changes in the gravitational potential .",
    "the instantaneous values of these integrals at the solar azimuth must differ in a periodic manner from those for similar stars at other azimuths , but the ordering of stars in @xmath48 and @xmath49 should not be affected , since the also follows the same non - axisymmetric potential .",
    "thus , neither assumption affects the topology of the distribution of stars in these variables , and no features in the distribution could be erased or appear if they were corrected .",
    "therefore , neither these assumptions , nor uncertainties in the galactic constants , @xmath37 & @xmath38 , compromises the principal scientific finding of this paper .     and @xmath50 .",

    "the near - parabolic lower boundary of the distribution reflects the fact that all the stars in this sample are currently within 200  pc of the sun , and therefore must have ever more eccentric orbits ( larger @xmath49 ) as their guiding centre radii , or @xmath48 , differ increasingly from that of the sun .",
    "the general decrease in density with increasing @xmath49 is expected in any reasonable stellar distribution , and the asymmetry between left and right results from the fact that the star density increases towards the galactic centre ; more stars visit the solar neighbourhood from the interior , which gives rise to the asymmetric drift .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the distribution in the space of these integrals also has substructure ; the most notable feature is a pronounced overdensity of stars rising with slightly negative slope from @xmath53 .",
    "[ angplt ] shows the distributions of angle variables for the same stars .",
    "we should expect fewer stars in the upper panel near @xmath54 and near @xmath45 , because such stars are visiting the solar neighbourhood at respectively the peri- and apo - centres of their orbits .",
    "the fact that the peaks are not symmetrically placed near @xmath55 is interesting , as discussed below .",
    "the azimuthal phase distribution has a single strong peak near @xmath46 because the stars are all local to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the width of this peak , which has a half - width at half - maximum of @xmath56 , reflects the spread in galactic azimuths of the guiding centres for stars currently passing by the sun .     as shown .",

    "when the potential includes an @xmath64-fold rotational symmetric perturbation with pattern speed @xmath65 , stars orbiting in the disc encounter wave crests at the doppler - shifted frequency @xmath66 .",
    "resonances arise when @xmath67 with @xmath68 at corotation , and @xmath69 at the lindblad resonances where the guiding center respectively overtakes , or is overtaken by , the wave at the star s unforced radial frequency . at ultraharmonic resonances . ]",
    "the loci of these three principal resonances for arbitrarily eccentric orbits are marked by the broken curves in this figure , which intersect the circular orbit curve where the more familiar epicyclic definitions of resonances apply .",
    "these lines are drawn for a bi - symmetric ( @xmath57 ) disturbance ; the lindblad resonances would be closer to corotation for @xmath70 .",
    "stars moving in a non - axisymmetric potential that rotates at a steady rate conserve neither their specific energy , @xmath14 , nor their specific angular momentum , @xmath15 .",
    "but the combination @xmath71 known as jacobi s invariant ( bt08 , eq .",
    "3.112 ) , is conserved .",
    "therefore , when a star changes its angular momentum by an amount @xmath72 caused by the rotating potential disturbance , it also changes its energy by the amount @xmath73 thus changes to these classical integrals caused by interactions with a steadily rotating disturbance have slope @xmath65 in the lindblad diagram .",
    "@xcite showed that a lasting change to the angular momentum of a star can occur only at resonances .",
    "as the slope of the circular orbit curve at corotation is @xmath65 , stars that exchange energy and angular momentum there do not move away from that curve , to first order , enabling exchanges to occur without heating , as described by @xcite .",
    "the other vectors show that exchanges at the lindblad resonances , on the other hand , cause stars to move onto more eccentric orbits ( farther from the circular orbit curve ) when angular momentum is redistributed outwards .",
    "this is the root cause of disk heating by spirals .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ lindblad ] shows in action space the same resonance lines and scattering vectors as the upper panel shows for the space of the classical integrals .",
    "exchanges at corotation cause horizontal shifts , implying no increase in @xmath49 , while gains in @xmath48 at the outer lindblad resonance , hereafter , and losses at the inner lindblad resonance ( ) both cause increases in @xmath49 .",
    "the labelled resonance lines are drawn for @xmath57 and an arbitrarily chosen value of @xmath65 ; the diagram for other adopted pattern speeds in this scale - free potential would have a similar appearance , but with the @xmath48-axis rescaled .",
    "the dot - dash lines in the lower panel mark the lindblad resonances for an @xmath60 wave of the same pattern speed , with the scattering vectors again shown .",
    "notice that the direction of the scattering vector closely follows the resonant locus for @xmath57 ( dotted curve ) only at the .",
    "thus , when stars are scattered at this resonance , they stay on resonance as they gain random energy , allowing very strong scatterings to occur .",
    "the opposite case arises at the , where the star is moved off resonance by a small gain of angular momentum .",
    "the alignment is closest for @xmath57 disturbances in potentials that yield flat rotation curves , but scattering is always stronger at the  than at the  for @xmath74 and in more general potentials .",
    "all three resonance lines have similar , though not identical , slopes in the action plot and for all @xmath75 .",
    "thus resonant stars will lie along a line in action space that has approximately the same negative slope for any resonance .",
    "however , we can identify the resonance at which they were scattered or trapped by examining the angles , since the resonance will have reset the values of the phase angles for trapped stars to have the relation @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath64 were defined above . both angles",
    "increase with time but the equation continues to hold at any fixed time because resonant stars have @xmath78 .",
    "thus the value of the `` constant '' in eq .",
    "( [ wphase ] ) varies as @xmath79 , but from an unknown value at some earlier @xmath80 that depends upon the phases of the stars relative to the perturbation .",

    "while the principal feature in fig .",
    "[ actplt ] is clear to the eye , i need a method to determine its statistical significance and to search for possible weaker features .",
    "this requires a statistic that contrasts the data with a comparable featureless model .",
    "ideally , a suitable featureless model would have a simple distribution function but the velocity distributions shown in fig .  [ dtbns ] are not simple ; the @xmath9-distribution is not gaussian ( it has a large kurtosis ) , while the @xmath7-distribution is complex and skew .",

    "i therefore adopt a bootstrap approach in which i resample the actual distributions of @xmath81 , @xmath9 & @xmath7 to generate comparison distributions of pseudo stars . selecting all three coordinates",
    "independently destroys the correlations that give rise to any features in integral space .",
    "while such a procedure could be dangerous if the velocity components have large and widely differing errors , the velocity and distance errors in the present sample are all small with respect to the ranges of the data .",
    "samples of pseudo data selected in this way populate the @xmath82-plane in a very similar manner to the real data , but with any small - scale structure smoothed away .    as a quantitative estimator of structure ,",
    "i compute the mean surface density of stars in @xmath82 space along resonance lines .",
    "i estimate the surface density of stars in the @xmath82-plane using an adaptive smoothing kernel @xcite of elliptical shape with axis ratio 12:1 to compensate for the differing ranges of @xmath48 and @xmath49 . to compute the mean density as a function of @xmath65 ,",
    "i integrate the estimated star density in this plane along a resonance line for that selected @xmath65 .",
    "the path of integration is from where the resonance line intersects the lower boundary of the stars to @xmath83 ; dividing by the length of this line yields the mean density .",
    "figure  [ linint ] compares the mean density along  lines for a range of @xmath65 with 99% confidence intervals ( shaded ) of the same quantity selected from 2000 samples of scrambled data .",
    "the figure indicates one highly significant feature with a pattern speed @xmath84 .",
    "no other feature is nearly as significant . repeating this analysis for trapping at corotation and at",
    "the , again revealed a single feature of high significance .    in  [ tests",
    "] , i report the results of tests for possible selection biases in this sample of stars that might affect the significance of the feature detected in figure  [ linint ] .",
    "figure  [ linint ] assumed a bisymmetric spiral pattern , but it is possible the resonance arose from a spiral having higher rotational symmetry . repeating the analysis assuming @xmath85 & 4 revealed maxima that were no less significant from that for @xmath57 but having different frequencies .",
    "thus not only do the action data not determine which resonance is responsible , but they do not determine the rotational symmetry of the pattern either .        ,",

    "[ actplt ] , except it uses the colours assigned in the upper panel . ]",
    "we can tell which resonance was responsible for the density excess in the @xmath82-plane by examining the distribution of phase angle variables for the stars .",
    "the distribution of @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ angplt ] ) has two peaks away from zero radians , while the distribution of @xmath20 values is narrow because all the stars in the sample are near the sun .",
    "because of this selection effect , we should expect the distribution of combinations of @xmath87 to resemble that of @xmath88 alone , were the two angle variables uncorrelated .",
    "[ restest ] shows the distributions , modulo @xmath89 , of three linear combinations of the two angle variables .",

    "the lower two panels assume patterns having two- or three - fold rotational symmetry ( @xmath57 or 3 ) .",
    "the peak near zero , which becomes more significant as @xmath64 is increased , is a selection effect , while the feature of most interest is the second peak away from zero , which is still present for @xmath60 ( not shown ) .",

    "the two peaks in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ restest ] indicate concentrations of stars near @xmath91 and 1.17 , or 9  and 67 .",
    "i have coloured the stars in these concentrations ; all those having @xmath92 and moderate radial action are coloured red , while those in the range @xmath93 are coloured blue .",
    "i have then used this colouring to show , in the lower panel , the locations of the same stars in the plot of actions , reproduced from fig .",
    "[ actplt ] .",
    "the blue stars are concentrated along the boundary of the lower plot , indicating that they are all close to the apocentres of their orbits and the concentration at this phase , discussed below , is probably of little dynamical significance .",
    "however , the red stars coincide with the resonance peak identified earlier .",
    "the boundaries of the triangle in the upper panel of fig .  [ polar ] enclose 639 stars .",
    "these geometrically simple boundaries are not intended to select all or only resonant stars , but it is likely that most of the selected stars are resonant .",
    "it is also likely that additional resonant stars lie outside these somewhat arbitrary boundaries .",
    "if we assume a @xmath64-arm spiral , we should change the polar angle to @xmath94 .",
    "polar plots for the cases @xmath85 & 4 ( not shown ) are very similar to the upper panel of fig .  [ polar ] except that the `` red '' stars are now concentrated at smaller angles , with almost equal significance .",
    "furthermore , almost the _ same set _ of stars form the local peak of the distribution of @xmath94 for @xmath95 & 4 as for @xmath57 , and they therefore again lie in the density excess in the action plot ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is the correspondence between the stars of the selected phases that also have values of their actions to place them in the scattering peak that provides the most compelling evidence for an .",
    "but once again the evidence can not discriminate whether the stars were trapped by an @xmath57 wave , or one having higher rotational symmetry .",
    "i have conducted an extensive series of tests to check the result in fig .  [ linint ] .",
    "the main concern is that the apparently resonant stars stand out because they share some other property unrelated to a resonance .",
    "some 37% of the  stars are known or suspected binaries .",
    "the significance of the resonance peak is unaffected by including or eliminating the stars flagged as possible or known binaries .",
    "increasing the kernel width used to estimate the density in the @xmath82-plane ( default @xmath96 ) smoothed the curve in fig .",
    "[ linint ] and lowered the maximum as expected .",
    "but it also reduced the ranges of the confidence intervals , so the feature remained highly significant .",
    "the principal source of uncertainty in the input data arises from the uncertainty in the distance to each star , which generally rises with distance to the star .",
    "i therefore repeated the analysis using stars lying within various distances from the sun ( @xmath97pc at the most extreme ) , which had little effect on either the significance or the position of the principal peak in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ linint ] .    performing the same analysis on stars separated into opposite hemispheres on the sky , either in equatorial or galactic coordinates , did not affect the significance of the peak . since the spectroscopic radial velocities could be more precise than those derived from the proper motion , i tried separating the stars into samples within @xmath98 of the galactic poles from those lying closer to the plane .",
    "the radial velocity contributes little to the @xmath99 velocity components for stars near the caps , but the scattering peak in this case is just as significant as for the remaining stars .",
    "i also tried separate analyses for stars in quadrants centred on the galactic centre and anti - centre , from those in quadrants centred on the apex and ant - apex of galactic rotation , again finding little change .",
    "finally , i investigated the effects of dividing the sample using by the energy of vertical motion , @xmath32 ( eq .  [ evert ] ) .",
    "the resonance peak is most significant among the stars in the lowest @xmath100 of the vertical energy range , and much less significant in the other 33% .",
    "such a dependence seems entirely reasonable , since stars with larger vertical oscillations will be much less affected by in - plane potential variations .",
    "these various tests have proved reassuring .",
    "the effects of selecting subsamples of the stars are all entirely consistent with physical expectations , and the likely influence of the small errors in the quantities tabulated in the catalogue",
    ".      the local standard of rest ( ) , which is the speed of a particle on a notional `` circular orbit '' passing through the sun s position , may not even be well - defined because the galaxy is at least mildly non - axisymmetric .",
    "furthermore , the sun s speed relative to the  is hard to determine , and estimates by binney and his collaborators @xcite from the  data have changed by several km  s@xmath12 at each revision .",

    "the possible systematic errors in these quantities are much greater than the small statistical uncertainties .

    ", none of the foregoing analysis could discriminate whether the  was that of a bisymmetric pattern or one of higher rotational symmetry .",
    "assuming @xmath106kpc and @xmath107lm  s@xmath12 , and using the evidence that the scattering peak was caused by an , we may determine the pattern speed of the disturbance from the frequency at which the mean density in fig .  [ linint ] peaks .",

    "if the disturbance responsible for the  is a spiral pattern ( it could be some other slowly rotating disturbance ) , one would expect corotation to lie within the disk of the milky way , which probably does not extend much beyond a galacto - centric radius of 14  kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also carraro  2010 ) .",
    "this argument would strongly disfavour an @xmath57 spiral , but the milky way disk may be extensive enough to accommodate spirals of higher rotational symmetry .    @xcite calculated the appearance of the @xmath13-plane in a simple galaxy model that was perturbed by a large - amplitude , long - lived , bi - symmetric spiral that rotated with various pattern speeds . for a pattern speed low enough to place the  near the sun",
    ", the phase - space structure they calculated did not correspond well with that observed , but higher pattern speeds that placed the sun near the ultraharmonic resonance of their assumed spiral created a feature resembling the hyades stream .",
    "they showed that the orbits responsible were 4:1 resonant periodic orbits in their adopted pattern . unlike in their work , my analysis makes no assumption about the spatial form or lifetime of the potential perturbation , but the fact that they favoured 4:1 periodic orbits as the cause of the hyades feature may be hinting that an @xmath60 spiral perturbation is favoured .    , but with those shown in red being the 639 stars picked out in fig .",
    "[ polar ] .",
    "the lower panel shows the positions , in right ascension and declination , of the highlighted stars . ]      the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ uvplot ] shows that the 639 stars that i coloured red in fig .",
    "[ polar ] lie in the `` hyades stream '' in @xmath13-space ( feature a of fig .",
    "[ uvcont ] ) .",
    "note that the highlighted stars do not include all the resonant stars ; thus the fact that not all the hyades stream stars are coloured , and that a few coloured stars are outside the stream may not be significant ( see  [ other ] )",
    ". it therefore seems clear that the larger part of the hyades stream is caused by the  identified here .    aside from their kinematics , i have been unable to find any property of these 639 stars that clearly differs from the parent distribution of the  sample .",
    "they have a similar distribution of distances , and incidence of binarity , for example .",
    "note that @xcite do find a mild , but significant , metallicity excess among the hyades stars compared with the mean for the , although @xcite find they are `` barely distinguishable '' from the background population .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ uvplot ] shows that the 639 red stars are almost uniformly distributed over the sky .",
    "note that i have excluded stars in the hyades cluster itself from all the analysis because it would be wrong to treat all the stars within a gravitational bound cluster as if they were dynamically independent . had i included the cluster , an additional 84 of the 112 hyades stars would have been coloured red in fig .",
    "[ polar ] , the resonant feature would have appeared yet more significant , and the cluster would have stood out as a strong concentration near @xmath109 .",
    "thus the hyades cluster itself is resonant .      were reliable ages for the stars available , we could use them to date the origin of the scattering peak , since it can contain stars of all ages except those that are younger than the wave that caused it .",
    "this is because the gas from which stars form is not subject to the laws of collisionless dynamics ; a gas cloud in a resonance will experience the same gravitational accelerations as do the stars , but dissipative collisions will quickly destroy the resonant signature in phase space .    while age estimates for individual stars appear to be unreliable @xcite , we can at least use the hyades cluster , which does appear to be resonant (  [ restrs ] ) .",
    "the cluster must have been formed before the perturbation that scattered it , which places an upper bound on the time since the resonance of @xmath110myr @xcite .",
    "to     we can use also use the spread in the spiral phase , or the width of the peak in fig .",
    "[ restest ] , to argue that the perturbation must have been recent . assuming spirals to be transient , the resonance will have had a width , @xmath111 ,",
    "thus the width of the spiral phase will increase with time as @xmath112 .",
    "a generous estimate of the width of the peak is @xmath113 radians ( or @xmath114 , over twice the width of the red triangle in fig .",
    "[ polar ] ) and therefore the time since the resonance @xmath115 ) , where the inequality arises because the width can only be increased by measurement error .",
    "the value of @xmath65 is given by the position of the peak in fig .",
    "[ linint ] , or @xmath116 . using @xmath106kpc and @xmath107 km  s@xmath12 and adopting @xmath57",
    ", i find @xmath117myr , or the resonance occurred within the last galactic rotation .",
    "this rough calculation made a number of assumptions ; assuming a sharper resonance or a broader spread of spiral phases would increase the time scale , but the values adopted seem reasonable .",
    "it is reassuring that this estimate is substantially less than the age of the hyades .",
    "i therefore conclude that the resonance is indeed very recent .",
    "note that not only will phase mixing blur resonances in angle space , but we must expect resonant features to become less distinct in action space over time because stars are also scattered by giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "the rate is hard to quantify , however , since the rate of cloud scattering is uncertain @xcite .      since the red stars in fig .",
    "[ polar ] turned out to be the hyades stream , i have attempted to identify in the same figure the other principal features named in fig .",
    "[ uvcont ] .",
    "i have coloured all the  stars lying in selected elliptical areas in velocity space in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ streams ] , and the same colours are used for each star in the lower two panels . again",
    "i use red for the hyades region , but here the selection deliberately errs on generous side to include most of the stream stars and more besides .    tracing these stars in other panels reveals that most of the hyades stream stars lie in the resonance ridge in fig .  [ actplt ] and have the range of phases that yielded the peak in fig .",
    "[ restest ] . the sirius stream ( green ) appears not to be resonant , as its stars extend over a significant range of @xmath48 but not in @xmath49 , and have no special concentration in phases .",
    "both the pleiades ( cyan ) and hercules ( blue ) stars are near the low-@xmath48 boundary of the sample and may be parts of larger structures that extend outside the sample , if so their range of phases may be limited .",
    "this selection effect makes it impossible for this diagnostic to determine whether they are associated with a resonance .",
    "the identification of an  in the solar neighbourhood is a powerful discriminant between the different theories of spiral pattern generation .",
    "it has long been known that spiral waves are damped at an  @xcite .",
    "@xcite , who argue that spiral patterns are long - lived waves , therefore require the  to be shielded in order to avoid fierce damping .",
    "thus evidence for an  excludes their quasi - steady spiral hypothesis as the originating mechanism for the disturbance that created it .",
    "while this evidence does not exclude the possibility of steady spirals elsewhere , it seems unattractive to invoke a different mechanism to account for spirals in places other than where we can mount a test .",
    "strong  damping of individual patterns therefore requires spirals to be continuously regenerated in order that they be common features in galaxies . while @xcite envisage spiral patterns as recurring transient responses , only my idea @xcite invokes resonant scattering as the _ cause _ of a recurrent cycle of true instabilities .",
    "indeed , i predicted @xcite that such a feature might be visible in the  data .",
    "the foregoing analysis and tests provide compelling evidence that the `` hyades stream '' in the solar neighbourhood has been created through scattering at a recent inner lindblad resonance .",
    "the strongest evidence is that the stars clustered over a narrow range of the combination of angles expected for an  are also those that lie in the highly significant overdensity in action space , as indicated by those coloured red in fig .",
    "[ polar ] .",
    "these same stars , which are distributed all over the sky , make up the hyades stream as shown in fig .  [ uvplot ] .",
    "@xcite construct a plot similar to fig .",
    "[ actplt ] , also using the  sample but restricted to the @xmath118 stars within 100  pc of the sun . instead of using radial action as the ordinate , their figure  17 uses the almost equivalent energy of non - circular motion , @xmath119 , and they scale their plot to include a larger range of epicycle sizes . because of the difference in scale , the feature i report here is rather inconspicuous in their figure , but their aim was to test for the feature i had claimed a hint of in @xcite .",
    "thus only the hyades stream ( feature a of fig .  [ uvcont ] ) can be attributed to this  and the remaining structures in the local phase space distribution must be accounted for in other ways .",
    "it is likely that the  of the bar in the milky way accounts for the hercules stream ( feature c , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we still lack convincing models to account for the pleiades and sirius streams .",
    "since neither feature stands out in fig .  [ streams ] ( see also fig .",
    "17 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these kinematic groupings of stars have probably not been caused by resonances with spirals , although they could perhaps still reflect the continued presence of spirals in this part of the disc with the resonances lying elsewhere @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies of spiral structure start with the assumption that the  of disk stars is smooth and featureless .",
    "the immediate implication of a prominent feature in fig .",
    "[ actplt ] is that this assumption is incorrect .",
    "the fact that it was created by an  is strong evidence against the disturbance being a quasi - steady spiral of the kind proposed by @xcite .",
    "rather , it supports the general picture of spiral structure generation that i have been advocating @xcite .",
    "since a spiral pattern should extend outwards from an , it is somewhat surprising to find evidence for one this far out in the galaxy .",
    "however , the transient spiral waves manifested by simulations of disc galaxies have a wide spread of pattern speeds @xcite , and do generally include some spirals in the far outer parts of the disc . the actual pattern speed implied by this resonance and the radii of corotation",
    "assuming it is a 2- , 3- or 4-armed spiral , are given in table  [ table ] ; the value for @xmath57 is clearly lower than other estimates for spirals in the milky way ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an up - to - date summary ) .",
    "while the many assumptions , such as the slope of the local rotation curve , the value of the , the neglect of non - axial symmetry , , are potential sources of large systematic errors in the _ values _ given in table  [ table ] , i have argued that none compromise the existence of the resonance . if the disturbance responsible for the  is a spiral , then a multi - arm pattern seems more likely than a bi - symmetric one , but it may also have resulted from some other type of slowly - rotating disturbance in the outer galaxy , such as a rotating bi - symmetric distortion of the halo .    once the still more precise and much more extensive data from _ gaia _",
    "@xcite become available , it will be possible to repeat this analysis with far larger samples of stars , and even at locations other than the solar neighbourhood .",
    "in particular , it should be possible to follow the azimuthal variation of stars in the resonance discovered here to determine its angular periodicity .",
    "it is to be hoped that other resonant scattering features will be found , and it may be possible to piece together the history of spiral waves in the milky way .",
