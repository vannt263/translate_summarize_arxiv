    "the origin of ultra - high energy cosmic rays remains a fundamental and unsolved problem in astroparticle physics .",
    "promising clues could be provided by the associated high energy neutrinos since they would neither interact with intergalactic or interstellar media nor be deflected by the magnetic fields .",
    "various detectors have been proposed for detecting high energy neutrinos .",
    "some of them rely on measuring the air shower by the so - called earth - skimming @xmath1 , for which horizontal showers are generated by the ensuing @xmath2 decay@xcite . in this paper , we investigate the shower properties by simulations . equipped with the knowledge of the @xmath1 induced air shower , we are able to calculate the induced geosynchrotron radiation .    in sec .",
    "ii , we present the corsika@xcite simulated shower profile to be employed in the calculation of geosynchrotron radiation in sec .",
    "our calculation is based on the coherent geosynchrotron emission scenario initiated in 1970s@xcite and further developed by huege and falcke@xcite . in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize and conclude our work .",
    "the tau decay induced air shower is initiated by the decay product . using corsika code",
    ", we simulate the shower initiated by electrons at five different energies .",
    "table [ stat ] presents the statistics of these simulations .",
    "the simulation shows that the shower particles reside in a shower thickness less than @xmath3 .",
    "compared with the radiation which traverses a distance of @xmath4 @xmath5 , the shower front at the shower maximum is treated as longitudinally coherent .",
    "the remaining structures are the lateral profile and lorentz factor distribution representing the spatial and energy distribution of the shower particles .",
    ".shower statistics [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ gamma ] and [ lateral ] show the energy and position distributions of the shower particles at shower maximum for different energies .",
    "both are displayed in the unit normalized to the total number at the corresponding energies .",
    "having determined the spatial structure and energy distribution of shower particles , we can calculate the emission from the shower maximum .",
    "[ interfere ] depicts the expected electric field at different receiver locations .",
    "the interference pattern arises from the scale of the shower front . in fig .",
    "[ pulse ] , we calculate the pulse measured by the receiver with a given bandwidth . this plot indicates how large the separation between antennae can be for the current technology .     for the maximum of a @xmath6 shower at the observation distance of @xmath7 .",

    "in this work , we investigate properties of the earth - skimming tau neutrino induced shower . the universal behavior of the shower particle allows a simple parametrization which will be helpful in future calculations of the geosynchrotron radiation",
