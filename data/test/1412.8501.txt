    "the internet is a primary example of a large - scale , self organized , complex system .",
    "understanding the processes that shape its topology would provide tools for engineering its future .",
    "the internet is assembled out of multiple autonomous systems ( ass ) , which are contracted by different economic agreements .",
    "these , in turn , compose the routing pathways among the ass . with some simplifications",
    ", we can represent the resulting network as a graph , where two nodes ( ass ) are connected by a link if traffic is allowed to traverse through them .",
    "the statistical properties of this `` internet graph '' , such as the clustering properties , degree distribution etc . , have been thoroughly investigated @xcite .",
    "however , without proper understanding of the mechanism that led to this structure , the statistical analysis alone lacks the ability to either predict the future evolution of the internet nor to shape its evolution .    a large class of models , a primary example is the `` preferential attachment '' model @xcite , use probabilistic rules in order to simulate the network evolution and recover some of its statistical properties .",
    "yet , these models fail to account for many other features of the network @xcite .",
    "possibly , one of the main reasons for that is they treat the ass as passive elements rather than economic , profit - maximizing entities .",
    "therefore , an agent - based approach is a promising alternative .",
    "game theory is one of the main tools of the trade in estimating the performance of distributed algorithms @xcite .",
    "it describes the behavior of interacting rational agents and the resulting equilibria .",
    "game theory has been applied extensively to fundamental control tasks in communication networks , such as flow control @xcite , network security @xcite , routing @xcite and wireless network design @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been increased activity in the field of _ network formation games_. these studies aim to understand the network structure that results from interactions between rational agents @xcite .",
    "different authors emphasized different contexts , such as wireless networks @xcite or the inter - as topology @xcite .",
    "the theme of such research is to investigate the equilibria s properties , e.g. , establishing their existence and obtaining bounds on the `` price of anarchy '' and  price of stability  .",
    "these metrics measure from above and below , correspondingly , the social cost deterioration at an equilibrium compared with a ( socially ) optimal solution .",
    "alternatively , agent - based simulations are used in order to obtain statistical characteristics of the resulting topology @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the vast majority of these studies assume that the players are identical , whereas the internet is a heterogeneous mixture of various entities , such as cdns , minor isps , tier-1 ass etc .",
    "there are only a few studies that have explicitly considered the effects of heterogeneity on the network structure .",
    "some examples include @xcite , which extends a previous model of formation games for directed networks @xcite , and in the context of social networks , @xcite .",
    "the latter describes a network formation game in which the link costs are heterogeneous and the benefit depends only on a player s nearest neighbors ( i.e. , no spillovers ) .    most of the studies on the application of game theory to networks , with very few exceptions , e.g. , @xcite , focused on static properties of the game .",
    "this is particularly true for network formation games .",
    "however , it is not clear that the internet has reached an equilibrium .",
    "indeed , ass continuously draw new contracts , some merge with others while other quit business .",
    "in fact , a dynamic inspection of the inter - as network suggests that the system may be far from equilibrium .",
    "therefore , a _ dynamic _ study of an inter - as network formation game is needed .",
    "in addition , previous work ignores an important requirement that autonomous systems has - reliability .",
    "indeed , failures occur , and an as must face such events .",
    "while some game theoretic works addressed reliability in other contexts @xcite , to the best of our knowledge , there are no works that considered the _ topological properties _ that emerge in a _ heterogeneous , dynamic , _ network formation game with _ reliability constraints .",
    "_    we establish an analytically - tractable model , which explicitly accounts for the heterogeneity of players as well as reliability requirements .",
    "we base our model on the heralded fabrikant model @xcite , which was recently extended to include heterogeneous players @xcite .",
    "we model the inter - as connectivity as a network formation game with _ heterogeneous _ players that may share costs by monetary transfers .",
    "we account for the inherent bilateral nature of the agreements between players , by noting that the establishment of a link requires the agreement of both nodes at its ends , while removing a link can be done unilaterally . as",
    "reliability comes into play , agents may require to be connected to other agents , or to all the other agents in the network , by at least two disjoint paths .",
    "we investigate both the static properties of the resulting game as well as its dynamic evolution .",
    "game theoretic analysis is dominantly employed as a `` toy model '' for contemplating about real - world phenomena .",
    "it is rarely confronted with real - world data . in this study",
    "we go a step further from traditional formal analysis , and we do consider real inter - as topology data analysis to support our theoretical findings .",
    "the main contributions of our study are as follows :    * in the context of network formation games , we provide a theoretical framework that introduces reliability constraints .",
    "we discuss both the case of frequent failures , where the fall - back pathways are as frequently used as the main pathways , as well as the case of rare crashes .",
    "* we introduce the concept of _ price of reliability _ , which is defined as the ratio of the social cost with reliability constraints to the social cost with no such additional constraints .",
    "surprisingly , we show that this price can be smaller than one , namely , that the additional reliability requirements may increase the social utility .",
    "* we provide dynamical analysis of topological quantities , and explain the prevalence of some `` _ _ network motifs _ _ '' , i.e. , sub - graphs that appear frequently in the network . through real - world data",
    ", we provide encouraging support to our predictions .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our model .",
    "we discuss alternative variants that address different failure frequencies or whether utility transfers ( e.g. , monetary transfers ) are allowed or not ; we address both the case of allowing utility ( i.e. , monetary ) transfers as well as the case where this is not possible .",
    "next , in section 3 , we provide static analysis .",
    "dynamic analysis is presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we compare our theoretical predictions with real - world data on inter - as topologies .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we assume that each as is a player . while there are",
    "many types of players , following @xcite , we aggregate them into two types : _ major league _ ( or t__ype - a _ _ ) players , such as major isps , central search engines and the likes , and _ minor league _ ( or _ type - b _ ) players , such as local isp or small enterprises .",
    "each player , regardless of its type , may form contracts with other players , and should they reach a mutual understanding , a link between them is formed . a player s strategy is set by specifying which links it is interested in establishing , and , if permissible , the price it will be willing to pay for each . in order to maintain reliable routing pathways , players may be required to sustain at least _ two disjoint paths _ to other players or a subset of players .",
    "we denote the set of type - a ( type b ) player by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "a link connecting node @xmath2 to node @xmath3 is denoted as either @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the total number of players is @xmath6 , and we assume @xmath7 .",
    "the _ shortest distance _ between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the minimal number of hops along a path connecting them and is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the degree of node @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "our cost function is based on the cost structure in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "players are penalized for their distance from other players .",
    "first and foremost , players require a good , fast connection to the major players , while they may relax their connection requirements to minor players .",
    "bandwidth usage and delay depends heavily on the hop distance , and connection quality is represented by this metric . similarly to @xcite ,",
    "we weight the relative importance of a major player by a factor @xmath10 in the cost function in the corresponding distance term .",
    "the link prices represent factors such as the links maintenance costs , bandwidth allocation costs etc .",
    "different player types may incur different link costs , @xmath11 , due to varying financial resources or infrastructure .",
    "all ass must maintain access to the internet in case of a single link failure .",
    "this is tantamount to the requirement that all the players must have at least two _ disjoint _ paths to each other node . nevertheless ,",
    "if either link prices are high , crash frequencies are low or the content of a minor as is of little value , players may relax their reliability requirements and demand the establishment of disjoint paths only to the major players .",
    "this is represented in the cost function by a control parameter @xmath12 , which is set to one if two disjoint paths are required to all nodes , and zero if the requirement holds for ( other ) nodes of major players only .",
    "conversely , if failures are often , then the regular and backup paths ( in the corresponding pair of disjoint paths ) are used almost as frequently . as such , they must be weighted the same in the cost function .",
    "therefore , the distance cost is composed of two terms , one represents the distance along the primary path and the other represents the distance along the backup path .",
    "the relative weight of these two terms is set by a parameter @xmath13 if failures are frequent and the likelihood of using either route is the same , we have @xmath14 .",
    "however , if failures are rare , traffic will be mostly carried across the shorter path .",
    "therefore its length should carry more weight in the cost than the length of the backup route , hence @xmath15 .",
    "this motivates the following cost function .",
    "two paths , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are disjoint if they have no node in common , namely if the unordered sets satisfy @xmath18    the cost function @xmath19 of node @xmath2 of type @xmath20 , is defined as:[cost - definition ] @xmath21    where @xmath8 and @xmath22 are the lengths of a pair of disjoint paths between @xmath23 that minimizes the cost function .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the length of the shorter path .",
    "formally , denote a pair of disjoint paths connecting player @xmath2 and player @xmath3 as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 @xmath26 is the length of shorter ( correspondingly , longer ) path . set @xmath27 then @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "if there is not pair of disjoint path player @xmath2 and player @xmath3 , then @xmath30 , with @xmath31if there is not a path connecting players @xmath2 and @xmath3 we also have @xmath32    for convenience , we set @xmath33 .",
    "we assume @xmath34 the social cost is the sum of individual costs , @xmath35 .",
    "we denote the optimal ( minimal ) social cost as @xmath36 _ _ , _ _ and the social cost at the optimal stable solution is @xmath37 .",
    "the _ price of stability _ is the ratio between the social cost at the best stable solution and its value at the optimal solution , namely @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , denote by @xmath39 the highest social cost in an equilibrium .",
    "then , the _ price of anarchy _ is the ratio between the social cost at the worst stable solution and its value at the optimal solution , namely @xmath40 .",
    "note that the requirement of disjoint _ node _ paths generalizes the requirement of disjoint _ link _ paths and protects against link failures within an autonomous system .",
    "all of our results apply to both notions of disjoint path ( except a refinement of theorem [ thm : symmetric dynamic ] ; see the discussion there ) . for simplicity and generality",
    "we shall use the notion of a disjoint node paths .",
    "we denote the change in cost of player @xmath2 as after the addition ( removal ) of a link @xmath41 by @xmath42 ( correspondingly , @xmath43 ) . the abbreviation @xmath44 is often used .",
    "if @xmath14 , then the two routing pathways are used the same . in this case ,",
    "the shortest cycle length @xmath45 is the relevant quantity that appears in the cost function .",
    "this can be found in polynomial time by using suurballe s algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath15 , routing will occurs along two disjoint paths , such that the length of the shortest between the two is shortest ( among all pairs of disjoint paths ) .",
    "although the complexity of finding this pair is np - hard , first finding the shortest path and then finding the next shortest path is a heuristic that works remarkably well , both in the real - world data analysis and on the networks obtained in the theoretical discussion .",
    "the reason behind this is that , when failures are rare , information is predominantly routed along the shortest path .",
    "when players are required to establish a fall - back route , they will establish a path that is disjoint from the _ current _ routing path , namely the shortest one .",
    "the establishment of a link requires the bilateral agreement of the two parties at its ends , while removing a link can be done unilaterally .",
    "this is known as a _ pairwise - stable _ equilibrium@xcite .",
    "the players strategies are _ pairwise - stable _ if for all @xmath46 , the following hold :    \\a ) if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 ;    \\b ) if @xmath49 , then either @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting graph is referred to as a _",
    "stabilizable _ graph .",
    "the additional reliability requirements result in additional link expenses , as for example , the degree of every node needs to be at least two .",
    "the _ price of reliability _ is the ratio between the optimal social cost under the additional survivability constraint to the optimal social cost when the additional constraints are removed .",
    "the cost function,@xmath52 , of node @xmath2 of type @xmath20 , is obtained by setting @xmath53 in definition [ cost - definition ] and requiring the existence of only a _",
    "path from player @xmath2 to any other players in the network .",
    "denote the optimal social cost without the additional survivability requirement in a pairwise stable equilibrium as @xmath54 .",
    "the _ price of reliability _ ( _ por ) _ is the ratio between the optimal value of the social costs among the set of stable equilibria , @xmath55 .",
    "surprisingly , we shall show that there exist scenarios in which reliability requirements _ increase _ the social utility , so that the price of reliability can be smaller than one .",
    "thus far , it was implicitly assumed that utility transfer is not feasible . nevertheless , often players are able to transfer utility , for example via monetary transactions . an extended model that incorporates such transfers",
    "is introduced by allowing for a monetary transaction in which player @xmath2 pays player @xmath3 some amount @xmath56 iff the link @xmath57 is established @xcite .",
    "player @xmath3 sets some minimal price @xmath58 and should @xmath59 the link is formed .",
    "[ monetary cost definition]the cost function of player @xmath2 when monetary transfers are allowed is @xmath60 .",
    "we recall the observation in @xcite that , without transfers , a link will be established only if _ both _ parties , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , reduce their costs , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "but , when monetary transfers are allowed , an edge will be established if ( and only if ) the relaxed condition @xmath63 holds . in game theoretic terms , this condition is equivalent to the requirement that the _ core _ of the two players game is non - empty .    _ _    in the remainder of the paper , whenever monetary transfers are feasible , we will state it explicitly , otherwise the basic model ( without transfers ) is assumed .",
    "we shall now analyze the properties of stable equilibria , such as the _ price of anarchy _ , which is the ratio between the social cost at the worst stable solution and its value at the optimal solution , and the _ price of stability _",
    ", which is the ratio between the social cost at the best stable solution and its value at the optimal solution . we shall further discuss topological properties that emerge from our analysis .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath64 the only stable solution is a clique and in @xcite it was shown that if @xmath65 then the major players form a clique .",
    "one may have guessed that reliability requirements , which generally induce the creation of additional , backup edges , would ease the formation of the clique .",
    "the next proposition shows that this naive assumption is wrong , and in fact , as the frequency of failure increases , it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the major player s clique .",
    "consider a dense set , in which every player may access all the other players within two hops by a at least two disjoint paths .",
    "a direct link between two players only reduces their mutual distance by one , and does not affect any other distance . if this link fails often , it may be used only partially , and it may not be worthy to pay its cost .",
    "hence , in this setting , counter intuitively , frequent failures end up with a sparser network .",
    "assume the frequency of failures is high , namely @xmath66 then , the type - a players form a clique if and only if @xmath67 .",
    "allowing monetary transfers does not change the result .",
    "we consider a major player s clique and ask under which conditions the removal of a link is a worthy move . consider an edge @xmath4 in this clique .",
    "since only the shortest distance between players @xmath2 and @xmath3 is affected , and is increased by one , the type - a players clique is stable if and only if @xmath68 .    as the major players ( tier-1 as ) form a densely connected set , a clique - like subgraph , in the rest of the paper we shall only consider the case where @xmath67 .",
    "we also assume , trivially , that @xmath69 , as otherwise the only stabilizable network is a clique .",
    "the next proposition describes a scenario in which , surprisingly , the additional reliability constraints _ reduce _ the social cost .",

    "the type - a clique is in blue squares . ]",
    "[ lem : reliable optimal 1 ] assume @xmath70 and symmetric reliability requirements , namely @xmath71 .",
    "then , the optimal network is composed of a type - a clique , where all the type @xmath72 nodes are connected to all members of the type - a clique , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - optimal - solution ] .",
    "this network is not stabilizable , and @xmath73 . nevertheless , for @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 . in addition , the price of reliability is smaller than one .",
    "the main idea behind this result is that in the optimal , yet unstable solution , every minor player establishes a link with all the major players ( fig .",
    "[ fig : the - optimal - solution ] ) .",
    "this configuration is unstable as it is over - saturated with links , and the optimal stable solution is obtained by diluting this network so that every minor player will connect to just two major players . if the reliability requirements are further removed , then additional dilution occurs , increasing the social cost . in other words ,",
    "the stable configuration is under - saturated with edges , and the additional survivability requirements facilitate the formation of additional links .",
    "  we shall now prove the first part of this theorem , namely that the network described in fig . [",

    "we denote this network by @xmath76    first , consider a network in which the type - a players are not in a clique .",
    "then , there exists two players @xmath77 such that @xmath78 . by establishing a link @xmath4",
    "the change in social cost is @xmath79 therefore a network which includes this link has a lower social cost .",
    "hence , in the optimal network , all the type - a players are in clique .",
    "a similar calculation for a missing link between player @xmath80 and @xmath81 shows that @xmath82    and establishing this link reduces the social cost as well . in conclusion , in an optimal network a type - a player is connected to all the other players .",
    "consider node @xmath83 its distance from every other node @xmath81 is @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the minimal distances between two minor players @xmath86 are @xmath87 and @xmath85 whereas in @xmath88 we have @xmath89 .",
    "assume that a network with a lower social cost exists , and denote it by @xmath90 . in @xmath90 there must exists a link between two type - b players , @xmath86 .",
    "however , removing this link reduces the social cost , as    @xmath91 therefore , @xmath90 is not optimal , in contradiction to our assumption .",
    "this proves that @xmath88 is optimal .",
    "next , we are going to show @xmath88 is unstable .",
    "consider @xmath92 and @xmath93 . by removing @xmath94",
    "we cost change of player @xmath95 is @xmath96    and therefore it is beneficial for player @xmath95 to remove this link .",
    "hence , this network in not stabilizable .",
    "finally , we are going to show that the @xmath97 .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "first , we are going to show that the network depicted in fig .",
    "@xmath98 is stable .",
    "the optimal stable network ( without reliability requirements ) in this parameter regime was explicitly derived in @xcite .",
    "we are going to show that the cost in the latter network is higher than the former , which bound the @xmath99 from above by a value smaller than one .",
    "consider a network in which all the minor players are connected to two major players , @xmath100 .",
    "we are going to show that this network is stable .",
    "clearly , as shown before , the type - a clique is stable .",
    "in addition , for any player @xmath92 neither @xmath101 nor @xmath2 has the incentive to remove either @xmath102 or @xmath103 as it would violate the reliability requirement and would lead to unbounded cost .",
    "hence , this network is stable .",
    "denote this network by @xmath104 in @xcite it was shown that the optimal stable network ( without reliability requirements ) in this configuration is the network in which all type - a players form a clique , and all the type - b players are connected to a single type - a player .",
    "we denote the latter network by @xmath105we have @xmath106    but , @xmath107    this concludes the proof .    in conclusion ,",
    "if the failure frequency is high , the survivability requirements will induce dilution of the clique of major players .",
    "however , the opposite effect occurs along the graph cut - set between the set of minor players and the set of major players , where the additional constraints lead to an increased number of links connecting major and minor players .",
    "so far we have assumed that the reliability requirements are symmetric .",
    "as explained in the introduction , in some cases it is reasonable to assume that players will require a backup route only to the major players , i.e. , non - symmetric reliability constraints .",
    "we shall now show that in this case , the social cost may deteriorate considerably .",
    "hence , from a system designer point of view , it is much more important to incentivize a configuration where the reliability requirements are symmetric , than to reduce failure frequency globally .",
    "this result stems from the following lemma .",

    "there are numerous scenarios in which players can not fully forecast other players moves and offers , e.g. , when information is asymmetric or when only partial information is available @xcite . in these settings , it is likely that a greedy strategy will become the modus operandi of many players .",
    "this is a prevalent strategy also when the system evolves rapidly and it is difficult to assess the current network state and dynamics .    in a dynamic network formation game ,",
    "a key question is : can a player temporarily disconnects itself from the graph , only to reconnect after getting to a better bargaining position ? or must a player stay connected ?",
    "if the timescale in which the costs are evaluated is comparable to the timescale in which the dynamics occur , then , clearly , a player will not disconnect from the network voluntarily .",
    "however , if the latter is much shorter , it may , for a very brief time , disconnect itself from the graph in order to perform some strategic move .",
    "the following rules address the two alternative limits .",
    "dynamic rule # 2a : let the set of links at the current move @xmath184 be denoted as @xmath185 .",

    "some of these links have a better connection value , but they come at a higher price .",
    "since all the links carry the same utility , we need to decide on some preference mechanism for player @xmath2 .",
    "the simplest one is the `` cheap '' choice , in which , if there are a few equivalent links , the player will choose the cheapest one .",
    "this can be a reasonable choice , as new players can not spend too much resources , and therefore they will choose the `` cheapest '' option that belongs to the set of links with maximal utility .",

    "if there are several players that satisfy the previous condition , then one out of them is chosen randomly .",
    "we are now at a position to identify an additional network motif , namely , the `` entangled cycles '' .",
    "this network motif is composed of a line ( i.e. , interconnected sequence ) of minor players nodes , with some cross - links between the nodes along this line , breaking the hierarchy ( fig .",

    "as such , when the next player arrives , it will offer the lowest link price .",
    "the new arrival will link to it and to one of its provider .",
    "the process will repeat , until , at some point , an existing player will decide that this growing branch is too far from it , and will connect to one of the nodes along this `` entangled cycles '' . at this point , this subgraph will be over - saturated with links as players may utilize this link to access the internet core .",
    "hence , some links will be removed ( see , for example fig .",
    "[ fig : the - entangled - loops](b ) ) .",
    "the set of the links that will be removed depends heavily on the playing order and the temporary network structure .",

    "[ fig : the - entangled - loops](b ) ) , then some links in the `` entangled cycles '' structure may be removed in subsequent turns .",
    "\\a ) assume that at time @xmath193 a subset of @xmath327 minor players first join the game .",
    "denote the set of players that are currently connected to the network by @xmath178 .",
    "we denote by @xmath328 ( @xmath329 the number of type a players ( correspondingly , type - b player ) at that moment .",
    "let us denote the players with the highest distance cost term as @xmath127 and @xmath330 , namely , @xmath331    where for simplicity we assumed that @xmath332 are minor player ( type - b players ) . according to the `` strategic '' pricing mechanism",
    "a new player will establish links with these players , as they will offer the cheapest links .",
    "note that by connecting to these players , its survivability requirements are satisfied , as each of these players maintain two disjoint path to every major player ( if the reliability requirements are asymmetric ) or to all other players ( in case of symmetric reliability requirements ) .",
    "we are now going to prove by induction that player @xmath333 will first connect to players @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
    "we shall prove by this by proving that the distance costs of @xmath334 and @xmath335 are maximal .",

    "[ prop : max distance ] it was shown that @xmath355    hence , @xmath354    as @xmath356 this expression is positive .",
    "hence , links will be established as stated .",
    "this shows that at the time player @xmath333 joins the game , the distance cost of player @xmath334 is maximal .",
    "a similar calculation shows that at this turn , the distance cost @xmath357 is maximal in the set @xmath358 .",
    "we have thus far shown that the first two links of a new player @xmath333 are to players @xmath334 and @xmath335 . nevertheless , as the `` entangled cycles '' motif grows , the incentive of other players to connect to players in it increases .",
    "at some point , player @xmath3 may be able to form links with players not in @xmath323 , or an active player @xmath359 may decide to connect to some player in @xmath323 ( or vice versa for @xmath360 ) . in either of these cases , players in the `` entangled cycles '' motif may have three disjoint paths to other players , and may therefore remove a link , should they deemed to do so . in this case , the `` entangled cycles '' motif will be diluted .",
    "this theorem shows that reliability is a major factor in breaking up tree hierarchy in the internet .",
    "in addition , it also hints that the hierarchical structure does not break frequently in the top levels of the internet , but rather mostly in the intermediate and lower tiers .",
    "note that according to theorem [ thm : entangled cycles motif](b ) , in large networks the length of the `` entangled motifs '' is short .",
    "therefore , we do not expect to see excessively long structures , but rather small ones , having just a few ass .",
    "in this section we compare our theoretical predictions with the real - world inter - as topology graph @xcite .",
    "we classified ass to major players and minor players according the popular caida ranking @xcite .",
    "for the sake of comparison with previous work @xcite , we classified the major players as the top 100 ass according to this ranking .    the mean length of the shortest cycle connecting a major player and a minor player as function of time , from january 2006 to october 2008 .",
    "the length decrease as time passes and the network grows , in agreement with our model . ]    in section [ sec : monetary - transfers ] , we showed that , by allowing monetary transfers , the maximal cycle length connecting a major player to a minor player depends inversely on the number of major players .",
    "as the number of ass increases in time , it is reasonable that the number of major player grows as well .",
    "hence , we expect that the length of the shortest cycle connecting a major player to a minor player will decrease in time .",
    "[ fig : the - mean cycle - length ] shows the mean cycle length connecting one of the secondary leading 2000 ass , ranked 101 - 2100 in caida ranking , and one of the top 100 nodes . the steady decline of the cycle s length in time",
    "is predicted by our model .    the ratio of the mean number of disjoint paths connecting a minor player to the core to the mean degree of a minor player .",
    "this ratio is above @xmath361 , and increases in time , showing that additional links are likely to part of disjoint paths to the core .",
    "this ratio is presented as a function of time from january 2006 to october 2008 . ]",
    "our analysis showed that in most of the generated topologies , the minor players are organized in small subgraphs that have direct connection to the internet core , namely the major players clique , or the tier-1 subgraph , in agreement with @xcite . in order to maintain a reliable connection , in each subgraph",
    "there must be at least two links that connect minor players to the core .",
    "indeed , we have found out that the ratio between the mean number of disjoint paths from a minor player to the core and the mean degree of minor players is more than @xmath361 , and it increases in time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disjoint path ratio ] ) .",
    "that is , almost every outgoing link of a minor player is used to provide it with an additional , disjoint path to the core . in other words ,",
    "a player is more likely to establish an additional link , hence increase its degree , if it supplies it with a new path to the core that does not intersect its current paths .        in section [ sec : dynamic - analysis ] we predicted the ubiquity of two network motifs , the `` double star '' motif ( fig .",
    "[ fig : generalized star 2 ] ) and the `` entangled cycles '' motif ( fig .",
    "[ fig : the - entangled - loops ] ) .",
    "we define the occurrence of a `` double star '' motif as the existence of a a connected pair of nodes , each with degree greater than @xmath184 , designated as the centers , such that at least @xmath184 neighbors of one center are also neighbors of the other center .",
    "we generated random networks according to the configuration model ( cm ) , in which each node is given a number of stubs according to its degree , and stubs are connected uniformly .",
    "then , we evaluated the mean number of occurrences of this motif in a random cm network with the same number of nodes and the same degree distribution as the real inter - as topology . for @xmath362",
    ", we have found @xmath363 occurrences in the real - world inter - as topology , whereas the mean number of occurrences in the random cm network was only * @xmath364 * instances ( the @xmath365 indicates standard deviation ) .",
    "namely , there are more than four times displays of this subgraph in the internet than in a random network with the same degree distribution .",
    "chebyshev s inequality provides a bound on the _ p - value , @xmath366 .",
    "_ this low value indicates that it is highly unlikely that a random cm network explains the frequent appearance of this network motif .",
    "we have tested the prevalence of this motif with other values of @xmath184 and the number of occurrences is consistently a few times more than expected in a random cm network .",
    "our analysis suggests that reliability considerations is one of the factors leading to the increased number of incidents .",
    "the unexpected prevalence of the `` feedback loop '' , which is a special case of the `` entangled cycles '' motif , was first reported in @xcite .",
    "the `` feedback loop '' motif coincides with the entangled cycles motif of length three , and in order to further assess our results we tested for the occurrence frequency of the `` entangled cycles '' motif of length four . we compared the number of occurrences of this motif in the real - world internet graph to the expected number of occurrences in a random configuration model network .",
    "while the number of instances of this motif in the internet graph was @xmath367 , the expected number of occurrences in the random network was only @xmath368 .",
    "as before , the abundance of this network motif , an order of magnitude greater than expected ( _ @xmath369 _ , a relaxed bound based on chebyshev s inequality ) provides a positive indication to the implications of survivability requirements .    in summary ,",
    "we have provided both static and dynamic empirical evidence that conform with our predictions , suggesting the importance of reliability considerations on the structure and dynamics of the inter - as topology .",
    "while many studies have tried to model the internet structure , the list of works the explicitly address reliability considerations is much shorter .",
    "furthermore , most of the theoretical models of the internet structure and dynamics assume homogenous agents , while the internet is inherently heterogeneous , composed of a wide variety of entities with different business models . in this work",
    ", we found that constructing a model that includes these two factors , namely reliability and heterogeneity , may provide important insights on the internet structure and dynamics .",
    "we first rigorously formulated a model of a network formation game in this context .",
    "our model is flexible , and may be used in a wide variety of settings .",
    "it allows for many variations and schemes , for example situations in which failures are frequent or rare , or to account for varying centrality of different types of players .",
    "the homogeneity of the model also allows us to describe scenarios in which a fallback route is required only to a subset of players .",
    "indeed , a reasonable as policy is to require a backup routing path only to the internet backbone , rather than establishing fault - tolerant routing pathways to every particular autonomous system .",
    "we established the _ price of reliability , _ which measures the excess social cost that is required in order to maintain network survivability in an optimal stable equilibrium .",
    "surprisingly , we showed that it can be smaller than one , that is , that the additional survivability constraints _ add _ to the social utility .",
    "we have also showed that reliability requirements have disparate effects on different parts of the network .",
    "while it may support dilution in dense areas , it facilitates edges formation in sparse areas , and in particular it supports the formation of edges connecting minor players and major players .    in our dynamic analysis",
    "we have found the repetitive appearance of small sub - graphs , or network motifs , namely the `` entangled cycles '' motif and the `` double star '' motif .",
    "indeed , the number of appearance of these motifs in the real inter - as topology surpassed the expected number by a few folds , indicating that additional factors support their formation , and as our analysis shows , survivability is one of them . we have also predicted that the length of the minimal cycle connecting a major player to a minor player should decrease in time .",
    "this prediction , too , was verified by a dynamic data analysis .    finally ,",
    "while our analysis focuses on the inter - as topology , it may be applied to other networks as well , that are composed of heterogeneous , rational agents that are required to maintain some reliability aspects .",
    "primary examples are trade networks and mvno operators in the cellular market .    in this work",
    "we have shown that a game theoretic analysis of network formation , which encompasses heterogeneous agents and explicitly addresses survivability concerns , holds promising results .",
    "nevertheless , there are many open questions , such as the following .",
    "how does the emerging network handle more than a single failure ? which incentive mechanism will promote increased reliability of the future internet ? what can a comparative analysis of experimental results on different networks tell us about the players strategies in each network ?",
    "these , and many more , indicate that there is yet a lot to uncover in this intersection between network formation , heterogeneity and reliability ."
