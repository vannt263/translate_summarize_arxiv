    "the interaction between charged particles is known to be strongly affected by a background plasma .",
    "examples include dusty plasmas , where the screening of the dust - dust interaction is mainly determined by ions  @xcite , and dense two - component plasmas  @xcite , where the ions are screened by weakly coupled electrons .",
    "these plasmas are expected to occur in the interior of giant planets and white dwarf stars . while in the former case the degree of screening is determined by the ion debye length ,",

    "recently , it was shown  @xcite that the density of a three - dimensional dusty plasma , where gravity is balanced by a thermophoretic force  @xcite , is not homogeneous .",
    "the reason is the screened dust - dust interaction which produces an inhomogeneous density profile in a harmonic confinement .",

    "this model is appropriate for the experiments of  @xcite , for which the normal modes of rather small dust crystals have recently been measured  @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , a fluid approach is expected to be accurate for long wavelength modes in a weakly coupled plasma . on the other hand ,",
    "the agreement of theoretical predictions  @xcite with experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite for confined ions turns out to be surprisingly good even in the strongly coupled phase .",
    "an analogous result for a confined one - component plasma with a screened interaction is still missing .",
    "open questions are the influence of screening on the normal modes and the eigenfrequencies . compared with the lagrangian description of ref .",
