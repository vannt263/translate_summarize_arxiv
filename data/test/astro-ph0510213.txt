    "[ fig : hr_beta ] ) .",
    "we approximated grb spectra with the band function @xcite and folded them with the batsedetector response matrix ( drm ) @xcite .",

    "a combination of a low @xmath3 and a very steep @xmath28 would give the hardness ratio below 0.3 which we do not observe .",
    "the fact that all events with @xmath33 have evident non - grb origin ( solar flares , vela  x-1 pulsar , etc . ) implies that a spectral cutoff below @xmath915 kev may be a distinguishing feature to separate non - grb sources .",

    "most of them were detected earlier as classic grbs by our scan of batse  data in 50300 kev band @xcite .",

    "thus this distribution is also consistent with the extrapolated hardness - intensity trend for long grbs @xcite .",
    "these facts support our conclusion that most of the x - ray dominated grbs should have a hard tail with @xmath32 in the batse  window 251000 kev ( see fig .",

    "relatively bright bursts gave good power - law with exponential cutoff fits .",
    "however , this does not mean that they could not be fitted by the band function . according to our results ,",
    "the existence of grbs with sharp spectral cutoff is questionable for events with low @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , the events with @xmath341020 kev would give a very low hardness ratio which we do not observe .",
    "note that , as shown by @xcite , only few percents of grbs with high @xmath3 are better described by a power - law with the exponential cutoff .",
    "if the dispersion in @xmath3 is due to variations in the redshift / blueshift in the source , then the spectral shape would be stable and our conclusion could refer to all grbs .",
    "1 .   despite the wealth of the x - ray dominated grbs observed by _ ginga _ , _ bepposax _  and _ hete-2_the number of soft grbs in the batse  data is relatively small",
    ". the fraction of events with the count rate in 2550 kev higher than that above 50 kev is @xmath95 per cent ( 20 per year with flux down to 0.1 ph @xmath2 s@xmath1 ) .",

    "the main fraction of grbs should have a relatively hard high - energy tail with a power - law slope @xmath35 .",
    "only a few per cent of the x - ray rich grbs have a tail with @xmath36 , but still harder than the exponential one .",
    "this fact clarifies the deficiency of soft events in the batse data .",
    "an exponential cutoff in the grb spectra , if exists , is probably a rare phenomenon .",
