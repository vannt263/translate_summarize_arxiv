    "light - cone gauge string field theory provides a useful way to define string theories @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "given the action , it is possible to define the amplitudes and calculate them perturbatively , although we should check if they are well - defined .",
    "since it is a gauge fixed theory , there is no problem in considering a light - cone gauge string field theory in noncritical space - time dimensions .",
    "being noncritical , it does not possess the space - time lorentz invariance .",
    "it should correspond to a string theory in a lorentz noninvariant background .",
    "in other words , we should be able to find a brst invariant worldsheet theory , with a nonstandard @xmath0 part .",
    "what we would like to do in this paper is to study this @xmath0 theory .",
    "we give the energy - momentum tensor and the action of the theory and calculate the correlation functions .",
    "we show that the energy - momentum tensor possesses desired properties , and construct a brst invariant formulation of the worldsheet theory .",
    "the reason why we are interested in this theory is that it can be used to regularize the string field theory .",
    "the dimensional regularization is one of the most powerful regularizations for ordinary quantum field theory and it may be useful also in string theory . in particular , in the light - cone gauge superstring field theory , unwanted divergences occur even at the tree level , because of the transverse supercurrent insertions at the interaction points of the vertices . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed a dimensional regularization scheme to deal with these divergences .",
    "we have found that the divergences of the tree amplitudes can be regularized by shifting the number of the space - time dimensions .",
    "we have checked that the results of the first quantized formalism are reproduced without any counterterms for the four - point case . in order to proceed",
    "further we need to show that the dimensional regularization preserves important symmetries of the theory .",
    "if the light - cone gauge string field theory corresponds to a brst invariant formulation even in noncritical dimensions , it means that the dimensional regularization preserves the brst symmetry .    in this paper",
    ", we deal with the case of closed bosonic string field theory .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the tree amplitude and consider the worldsheet theory on the complex plane .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : lccov ]",
    ", we present a way to rewrite light - cone gauge string amplitudes in a brst invariant form .",
    "we follow the procedure in noncritical dimensions , and show what kind of worldsheet theory of @xmath0 should appear in the end . in section [ sec : xpmcft ] , we study the theory for @xmath3 and show that it is a cft with the right virasoro central charge .",
    "namely , combining the cft for @xmath3 constructed here with the worldsheet theory for the light - cone gauge strings in noncritical dimensions , we obtain a cft with the central charge @xmath4 by which we can define a brst invariant worldsheet theory . in section [ sec : brst ] , we show that the tree amplitudes in the noncritical case can be written in a brst invariant form .",
