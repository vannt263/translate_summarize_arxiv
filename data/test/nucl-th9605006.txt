    "in a previous paper @xcite in reactions of @xmath0c and @xmath1li projectiles on a @xmath0c target , it has been shown that the total reaction cross section , inclusive fragment cross sections and fragment momentum distributions are sensitive to the assumed proton and neutron radial density distributions of the projectile .",
    "these results stimulated us to further investigate effects of nuclear shape of neutron rich isotopes in the heavy ions reactions .",
    "a special attention in our investigations will be given to the neutron halo nuclei for the following reason .",
    "recent developments of radioactive nuclear beams enabled one to study a detailed structure of nuclei far from the stability line @xcite .",
    "the neutron halos have been observed in nuclei near the neutron drip line by reaction measurements with intermediate and high energy radioactive nuclear beams .",
    "these nuclei are of a special interest in relation to shell structures near the drip line and to new excitation modes associated with the excess neutron on the nuclear surface .    in this paper",
    "we use the method of hyperspherical functions ( hsf ) @xcite to construct the densities of the light drip line nuclei .",
    "such nuclei typically have small binding energies and extended radial densities , and for them a suitable treatment of the tails of nuclear radial wave functions is essential .",
    "physically such wave functions should have exponential tails .",
    "a main advantage of the hsf is that it provides a realistic radial wave functions at large distances .",
    "in addition , the spurious center - of - mass motion is removed from the onset and the symmetries are properly taken into account . in @xcite",
    ", an attempt was made to provide a unified description of @xmath2li rather than just a single isotope . instead of trying to parameterize the effective interaction for each isotope , a simple parametrization for all the isotopes is used .",
    "furthermore , there is no inert core and all the nucleons are properly antisymmetrized . finally ,",
    "because jacobian coordinates are used , no problems are encountered with the treatment of the center of mass .",
    "the binding energy of a nucleus serves as a natural scale in this approach and is related to all other observables .    in order to account for the clusterization effect more precisely in our calculations",
    ", we expand the hsf in the translationally invariant many body harmonic oscillator ( ho ) functions @xcite and implement the nuclear structure straight in the densities .",
    "we use a few one - body oscillator parameters in order to better reproduce the experimentally observed mean - square radii ( rms ) and density distributions .",
    "these densities are then used in monte carlo simulations of nucleon - nucleon collisions , in which the total and inclusive cross sections and transverse momentum distributions of fragments are calculated .",
    "thoroughly tested , this approach gives a clear picture of nuclear shape .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the hsf method is described .",
    "next we elaborate on the details of the expansion with respect to the radial wave functions of a ( 3a-3)-dimensional harmonic oscillator . in section iii , we give a brief summary of the light isotopes and construct their young diagrams .",
    "knowing the underlying symmetries , we first build the `` normal '' @xmath0c density and compare it with other approximations .",
    "we calculate the elastic form - factor and run a @xmath0c + @xmath0c simulation to see how it works in a standard case .",
    "armed with the results , we proceed to the neutron rich @xmath1li and also @xmath1be , @xmath1c for comparison . in order to make the paper more coherent ,",
    "we include all the densities in section iii and analyze the reactions in section iv .",
    "the results are in reasonable agreement with experiment and other theoretical approaches .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "the hsf method involves a collective variable ( hyperradius @xmath3 ) which is related to the mean - square radius of the nucleus @xmath4 , i.e. , to the mean nuclear density .",
    "the excitations of this degree of freedom correspond to the monopole oscillation of the nucleus as a whole and thus the density can be treated as dynamic variable .",
    "the wave function @xmath5 of a nucleus with @xmath6 nucleons is translationally invariant and depends on the @xmath7 jacobi coordinates , defined as @xmath8 \\\\ & \\vdots & \\nonumber \\\\ x_{a-1 } & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{a-1}{a}}\\bigg [   \\frac1{a-1 } \\sum_{i=1}^{a-1 } { \\bf r}_i - { \\bf r}_a \\bigg ] \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 is the coordinate of the @xmath10th nucleon .",
    "each coordinate is a distance between the @xmath11-th nucleon and and the center of mass of the groups of nucleons @xmath12 .",
    "the hyperspherical coordinates ( hyperradius @xmath3 and @xmath13 hyperspherical angles ) are chosen as @xmath14 for @xmath15-dimensional space of the jacobi coordinates .",
    "for this set of coordinates , the volume element @xmath16 reads @xmath17 where the solid angle element @xmath18 is @xmath19 the laplacian is given by @xmath20    the hyperspherical functions , or @xmath21harmonics , are the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the laplacian @xmath22 the value of @xmath23 is the analog of the angular momentum at @xmath24 and is called the global momentum .",
    "the subscript @xmath25 denotes all the quantum numbers necessary to enumerate the various degenerate states of eq .",
    "( [ ang ] ) .",
    "for @xmath25 it is expedient to use the young diagram @xmath26 $ ] and the yamanouchi symbol @xmath27 , characterizing the @xmath21harmonics properties relative to the @xmath28nucleon permutations , and @xmath29 to designate the orbital momentum , spin and isospin of this state .",

    "the collective potential @xmath36 is given by integrals containing two - body matrix elements together with the @xmath21harmonics fractional parentage coefficients . in the previous investigations @xcite it was shown that with the hsf one may use the same formulas for the fractional parentage coefficients which were obtained earlier with the translationally invariant shell model . in this case the talmi - moshinsky coefficients must be replaced by the raynal - revai coefficients , 6j - symbols must be added for the over - binding of the global momentum @xmath23 , and additional phase multipliers are inserted .",
    "their use has led to a significant improvement of the computations @xcite .",
    "the calculation is simplified if only the first few terms in the expansion ( [ expan ] ) , i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are taken into account .",
    "usually one adopts the @xmath43 approximation in which all values of k greater than @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) are neglected .",
    "the success of this approximation lies in the fact that the centrifugal barrier reduces the contributions of configurations with @xmath23 greater than @xmath43 in the equations determining the hyperspherical wave functions .",
    "the system ( [ schrod ] ) has an analytical solution for the harmonic oscillator potential @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath47 with the eigenfunctions @xmath48 where we have introduced a dimensionless parameter @xmath49 with @xmath50 and the associated laguerre polynomials are defined as @xmath51 let us briefly examine critical regimes for the schroedinger equation ( [ schrod ] ) . as @xmath52 , it is reduced to @xmath53 with the trivial eigenfunction @xmath54 on the other hand , as @xmath55 , the eq .",
    "( [ schrod ] ) reads @xmath56 and the eigenfunction has the following asymptotical behavior @xmath57 as was mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we will return to this important point in next the section .",
    "now we can express radial functions @xmath58 in terms of the @xmath59-dimensional harmonic oscillator , as shown on figure 1 for the @xmath60c nucleus , @xmath61 and the expansion coefficients are given by @xmath62 with the oscillator frequency @xmath63 determined so that the maximum of the lowest oscillator function @xmath64 coincides with the maximum of the lowest hyperspherical function @xmath65 .",
    "we will deal only with the ground state wave function and use @xmath66 for short .",
    "it is striking that the overlap integral of the ground state radial function @xmath67 with the lowest oscillator function @xmath64 is @xmath68 .",
    "at the same time , the contribution to @xmath67 of the two - quantum oscillator excitation is exceptionally small .",
    "a very small value of the coefficient @xmath69 is not fortuitous but conforms to the theorem @xcite , which states that if the oscillator frequency @xmath63 is chosen to make the overlap integral of @xmath64 and @xmath67 maximal , then the overlap integral of @xmath67 with @xmath70 is strictly zero .    as we have already noted , in choosing @xmath63 we did not achieve a maximum value of the @xmath67 , @xmath64 overlap , but assured only a coincidence of the maxima of these functions .",
    "however , if such a condition is satisfied , the overlap integral of the functions is fairly near the maximum , and the coefficient @xmath69 is very small , although nonvanishing .",
    "this circumstance casts light on the origin of close agreement between the results of the translationally invariant shell model and the hsf method for the ground state .",
    "since the function @xmath70 can not be mixed with @xmath64 , the shell function in the hsf method is improved by admixture of states with oscillator energy @xmath71 and higher .",
    "because of the large difference between the energies of these states and the ground state , this admixture is small .",
    "then one can derive the binding energy as a function of the interaction matrix elements @xmath72 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{\\mu } \\frac { c_\\mu}{c_\\nu } \\ , \\int r_{\\nu k } ( \\rho )   w^{k \\mu}_{k\\nu } ( \\rho )   r_{\\mu k } ( \\rho ) \\rho^{3a-4 } d\\rho \\label{bind}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rms of a nucleus is given by @xmath73 \\label{rmso}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "using the young - yamanouchi classification scheme @xcite , which stems from the orthogonal representation of a given permutation group , and with the knowledge of the total spin and isospin of the nucleus , we determine the symmetry with a corresponding young diagram @xmath26 $ ] of each isotope . in table",
    "i results of the classification of @xmath74li , @xmath75be , @xmath76b ( for completeness ) , and @xmath77c nuclei are collected .",
    "the lithium sequence , illustrated in figure 2 , reflects the strong excitation in the isospin .",
    "the neutron super - rich @xmath78li obtains an extra pair of halos in the same manner as @xmath79li results from @xmath80li by adding two halo neutrons . in the brackets we have put two possible versions of a transitory @xmath81li state .    note that while for the most part these sequences are rather straightforward , obtained by a simple adding of a neutron to the p - shell , some isotopes like @xmath79be do stand out .",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in the effect of clusterization , and our scheme seems to agree with a recent study of the multi - cluster structure @xcite , that a simple description in terms of one young diagram may not be adequate for some isotopes .",
    "having thus established the symmetry requirements on the neutron content of different isotopes , we proceed to construct the density distributions for the light nuclei .",
    "originally , this classification was applied to the construction of the hsf wave functions @xcite . in table",
    "ii we reproduce their results for the binding energy and rms for @xmath82li and @xmath1c isotopes in comparison with the experimental data . it can be seen that the variation in the binding energy as a function of the mass number and rms for the lithium isotopes is qualitatively reproduced .",
    "a comparison of @xmath1li and @xmath1c shows a very strong nuclear structure effect on the binding energy and rms .    if one would like to look at the more detailed description of the nuclear structure which comes with the wave function and exhibits the nuclear shape through the nuclear densities , one may use the information that comes from measurements of the total reaction cross sections and the inclusive cross sections for fragments in which the projectile has lost one neutron or proton . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that both the cross sections and the fragment momentum distributions lead to the conclusion that the hsf density distributions in the @xmath43 approximation extend too far for protons and not far enough for neutrons .",
    "the inclusion of several more terms in the expansion ( [ expan ] ) will give an extension of the asymptotic density to larger radii .",
    "this will give better agreement between the hsf method and the experimental data .",
    "for this reason we propose another approach in which the clusterization effect is taken into account directly in the density .      from the formulae in section ii one",
    "derives the density of nuclear matter through @xmath83 with @xmath84 and the radial component is expressed as @xmath85    the radial density distribution reads ( @xmath45 ) @xcite @xmath86 with the s - shell ( first line ) and p - shell densities explicitly shown .",
    "we also treat the halo neutrons @xmath87 separately from the p - shell nucleons .",
    "the rms of each shell is calculated as @xmath88 with the density normalization @xmath89    before calculating the densities for the neutron rich isotopes , we would like to check on a standard nucleus such as @xmath0c , for which there exist a few other density approximations .    * in ref .",
    "@xcite the exact hsf density for @xmath90he , @xmath91li , @xmath60c , and @xmath92o was approximated by @xmath93 motivated by the analogy with the harmonic oscillator . using different oscillator parameters @xmath94",
    ", one could easily fit various experimental observables , such as the rms and so on . for the ground state of @xmath60c",
    ", it was enough to have the first two terms @xmath95 with @xmath96fm , @xmath97fm and @xmath98 , @xmath99 fixed to the normalization of 4 s - shell and 8 p - shell nucleons . *",
    "harvey used a phenomenological approach @xcite to obtain the densities for @xmath60c and @xmath79li .",
    "since the monte carlo simulations require a separate density distribution for nucleons with different binding energies , a harmonic oscillator model was used for projectiles and a standard fermi shape for the @xmath60c target .",
    "for example , for @xmath1li the @xmath100shell parameter was chosen to be @xmath101fm for protons and neutrons , and for the @xmath102-shell @xmath103fm for protons and @xmath104fm for neutrons .",
    "it was also assumed that there was one proton and four neutrons in the @xmath105-shell .",
    "the outer two neutrons were assumed to have an exponential density distribution beyond a radius of @xmath106fm @xmath107 with @xmath108=3.7 fm . as we mentioned above",
    ", the hsf functions have an exponential asymptotics ( [ asym ] ) and thus become very attractive from a phenomenological point of view .",
    "the normalization , 0.3323 , came from the requirement that the volume integral contain just two neutrons .",
    "the values of the harmonic oscillator parameters and of @xmath108 were chosen to fit the experimental reaction cross section and the @xmath109li , @xmath110he inclusive cross sections for the reaction @xmath1li+c at 790 mev / a . * returning to the hsf method , one does not have as much freedom in choosing various parameters .",
    "it is very important that in the hsf one obtained a self - adjusted system in which the parameters of the interaction determine the size of the system .",
    "however , working in the @xmath43 approximation , one needs to improve the neutron density asymptotics .",
    "having derived the explicit formula ( [ dense ] ) for the density distribution and knowing the symmetry requirements on the neutron content of different isotopes , we are now in the position to do it directly in the density .    since the wave function characterizes the nucleus as a whole , the binding energy e@xmath111 , cf .",
    "( [ bind ] ) , sets its scale @xmath112 .",
    "it also serves as a natural parameter for the s - shell , the core of a nucleus .",
    "the p - shell basically carries all the information about a given isotope , and its scale will be chosen so that experimental rms is reproduced . in accordance with our group - theoretical framework ,",
    "another parameter will be used for the halo neutrons , still fitting to the experimental rms .",
    "for example , the p - shell density then reads @xmath113 with scaling @xmath114    table iii shows the parameters for these densities , the rms for each shell and of the nucleus as a whole .",
    "they reproduce the experimental radii of tanihata , et al . @xcite . in figure 3",
    "we plot the densities for @xmath60c and @xmath79li .",
    "the @xmath79li one is in reasonable agreement with the shaded region of the experimental density @xcite .",
    "having obtained the total densities , one can quickly probe its charge distribution by looking at the elastic @xmath115 scattering off that nucleus , or its charged form - factor . for a nucleus with @xmath116 protons",
    "it may be written in the born approximation as @xmath117 with the elastic point - proton form - factor @xmath118 defined as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the proton part of the total density .",
    "the correction for the center of mass motion @xmath121 is not required in our approach since it is factorized from the very beginning ( cf .",
    ". [ schrod ] ) .",
    "@xmath122 is the correction for the finite proton size , which we take to be @xmath123^{-2}\\ ] ] with @xmath124@xmath125 corresponding to @xmath126fm for the proton .    in figure 4",
    "we plot the charged form - factors for @xmath91li and @xmath60c with the data points taken from @xcite , where for the momentum axis a standard @xmath127 is used @xmath128\\ ] ] note , that the elastic rms radii for these nuclei are different from the reaction ones @xcite , and we have slightly modified our parameters so that their densities reproduce the observed @xmath129fm and @xmath130fm .",
    "our results match well the minima of the experimental form - factors and qualitatively follow their shape .",
    "they also compare favorably with the full hsf calculation @xcite .    having determined all the parameters in the density , we are ready to analyze the reactions .",
    "the monte carlo method allows the calculation of cross sections and momentum distributions of primary fragments arising from nucleon - nucleon collisions between a target and a projectile at energies above 200 mev / nucleon .",
    "the primary fragments may subsequently decay to the final observed nuclei .",
    "this method has been shown @xcite to give results in good agreement with experiment for the total reaction cross section , fragment inclusive cross sections , fragment exclusive ( coincidence channel ) yields , fragment momenta , both inclusive and in different coincidence channels .",
    "it is also possible to calculate the momentum distributions of nucleons that are either knocked out of the projectile or come from the subsequent decay .",
    "thus , unlike many theoretical techniques , the monte carlo decay method permits the comparison of calculated and experimental values for essentially all the measured quantities and allows to test radial density distributions derived from various theoretical models .",
    "the purpose of the present work is therefore to compare experimental values with those obtained from the hsf density distributions with the aim to get the maximum of information about nuclear shape .",
    "when one or two neutrons are lost in a collision between the projectile with a diffuse neutron rich surface and a target nucleus , the transverse momentum distribution of the fragments thus produced can be fit with a double gaussian curve in which a narrow component is superimposed on a much broader one @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is also observed for fragments from the normal projectile @xmath0c .",
    "the shape of the fragment momentum distribution is sensitive to the assumed projectile surface diffusivity . as the surface diffusivity increases , the width of the broad component decreases .",
    "for the sharp cutoff shape , the distribution has no narrow component .",
    "the study of the nuclear structure effect in @xmath60c + @xmath60c scattering , using the optical model @xcite and the calculation of the total reaction cross sections in the glauber model @xcite convincingly show that the total reaction cross sections are sensitive to the form of the density . with that in mind",
    ", we have conducted the monte carlo simulations with three different densities : minimal @xmath131 , obtained with @xmath132 instead of the full function @xmath133 of eq .",
    "( [ sumho ] ) , @xmath134 and the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ hoho ] ) .",
    "the experimental data and our results are collected in table iv .",
    "as expected , the total cross sections did not vary much , since we had the same @xmath135 for each density distribution .",
    "the tail effect is deduced from the momentum distribution of @xmath1c fragments . in a fit with the double gaussian curve ,",
    "the narrow component reflects the behavior of the tail of the density and thus we see that having all four functions of the eq .",
    "( [ sumho ] ) decomposition improves the resulting width of both narrow and broad components as compared to the minimal @xmath131 density .",
    "in figure 5 we fit the transverse momentum distribution of the @xmath1c fragments from our @xmath134 density with one and two gaussian curves .",
    "one gaussian fit is quite reasonable and gives a very close @xmath136 to the experimental @xmath137 .",
    "overall , our numbers match well with the experimental data and phenomenological results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "having thus convinced ourselves that this approach works well for the standard nucleus , we turn to the reactions with the neutron rich isotopes as projectiles on the carbon target .      in analyzing this reaction",
    ", we emphasize the halo effect .",
    "the momentum distribution of @xmath109li fragments from @xmath1li + c at 790 mev / c has been experimentally studied @xcite .",
    "it has broad and narrow gaussian components with widths of 80 and 21 mev / c and a ratio of areas b / n of 1.5 .",
    "since the shape of the momentum distribution is sensitive to the projectile surface diffusivity , we have used two different hsf densities with a very loose pair of halo neutrons @xmath138li@xmath139 and another one @xmath138li@xmath140 by placing them relatively close to the p - shell .",
    "the results for @xmath138li@xmath139 are shown in figure 6 and the rest is summarized in table v. while the width of the broad component is well reproduced , the narrow component is too wide , especially for @xmath138li@xmath140 .",
    "this result is consistent with the absence of a long neutron ` tail ' at large radii and low local neutron densities which give a small value for the local fermi momentum .",
    "a short tail also manifests itself in the somewhat low total cross sections , which drops even more for @xmath138li@xmath140 .",
    "this indicates that the halo pair gives a major contribution to the neutron tail and has an unusually large rms radius .",
    "we would like to point out that our result @xmath141fm for an outer pair of halo neutrons for @xmath138li@xmath139 is consistent with experimental @xmath142fm @xcite and @xmath143fm @xcite .    at last",
    ", we would like to analyze the structure effect by comparing @xmath79li , @xmath79be , and @xmath79c , which have the same number of nucleons but different young diagrams . from @xmath79c with @xmath26= [ 443]$ ] and isospin @xmath144",
    ", one sees the increase in the isospin in @xmath79be with @xmath26=[4331]$ ] , @xmath145 to @xmath79li with @xmath26= [ 4322]$ ] , @xmath146 .",
    "their cross sections , see table vi , vividly show this change in their nuclear structure . starting with @xmath147 mb",
    ", the cross section jumps to @xmath148 mb for @xmath79be , indicating some sort of a halo neutron tail and culminates in @xmath149 mb with two halo neutrons .",
    "it unambiguously verifies that our approach correctly implements the underlying symmetries of each isotope and works well with a judicious choice of parameters directly in the density level , bypassing the parameters of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the hyperspherical functions method provides a convenient basis for the description of the neutron rich isotopes .",
    "the underlying symmetry of each isotope exhibits a simple structure and reproduces the clusterization effect .",
    "studies of the reaction cross section and the inclusive cross sections for fragments in which the projectile has lost one neutron or one proton give a powerful method for investigating the neutron , proton and total densities in the surface of the projectile .",
    "here we have proposed a new approach which takes into account the clusterization effect directly to the densities of the drip line nuclei .",
