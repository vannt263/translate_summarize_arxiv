    "during the last few years the research on quantum turbulence ( qt ) has been flourishing .",
    "recently , the decay of qt at low temperatures has been one of the main topics in this research .",
    "an important part of the decay is expected to be due to the kelvin - wave cascade that works on length scales smaller than the intervortex distance .",
    "due to circulation quantization the classical kolmogorov decay can not work at these scales .",
    "it is expected that at low temperatures , where the dissipation due to mutual friction ( m.f . )",
    "is negligible , the kelvin cascade pushes the energy down to the scales of order the vortex core where it can be dissipated due to phonons .",
    "however , the kelvin wave cascade works also at finite temperatures with nonzero mutual friction but its range is expected to be limited to scales larger than the mutual friction limited dissipation scale . here",
    "we consider nonzero temperature , since by doing so we avoid the difficulty to model the dissipation at smallest scales . naturally , we are most interested in the zero temperature limit .",
    "our results indicate that the spectrum depends only weakly on mutual friction .",
    "therefore we hope that our results are also valid in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "kelvin waves are helical distortions on a vortex . coupling between different kelvin modes results in a cascade from large scales to smaller ones .",
    "currently there are two competing theories that predict a slightly different exponent for the kelvin wave spectrum @xcite .",
    "there are also some numerical calculations @xcite , but currently the correct spectrum is still under active debate @xcite",
    ". here we will put our spoon in the same soup by introducing our results from the simulations .",
    "to obtain and accurately determine the steady state energy spectrum one should be able to simulate a large range of scales .",
    "even nowadays this is quite difficult when we have a large vortex tangle with hundreds of vortices . for a steady state",
    "one should additionally prepare a drive , that typically works on large scales , and dissipation that is strongest at smallest scales .",
    "since we are more interested in the kelvin cascade , we simplify the situation here and consider only a single vortex by having a configuration that is similar to refs . [ ] .",
    "however , we damp the smallest scales by including the mutual friction . to drive the kelvin waves we force the endpoints of the vortex to move sinusoidally perpendicularly to the direction of the unperturbed straight vortex , i.e. @xmath3 = @xmath4 , @xmath5 , for points @xmath6 .",
    "we still assume periodic b.c . along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "this corresponds to a period grid of pinning points moving coherently , which somewhat reminds an oscillating grid where a vortex extends over several grid holes .",
    "pinning points are considered to be small .",
    "the frequency of the oscillation is adjusted to be close the resonance frequency of the kelvin wave , given by @xmath8 here @xmath9 mm@xmath10/s is the circulation quantum , @xmath11 10@xmath12 mm is the vortex coresize , and @xmath13 is simply euler constant .",
    "we use the vortex filament model where the vortex is considered to be thin @xcite . by adopting the scale separation scheme developed by kozik and svistunov @xcite we are able to use much better resolution than in the earlier work by vinen _",
    "et al._@xcite , one should note that even if the scale separation scheme reduces the amount of work done ( on average ) per one time iteration from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of points on the vortex , the number of operations for a fixed time window scales like @xmath17 ( without scale separation the work is proportional to @xmath18 ) .",
    "this is because the numerical time step scales like @xmath19 .",
    "our numerical scheme is standard practice in the vortex filament formulation except for the addition of the scale separation scheme .",
    "we use the standard 4th order runge - kutta method and adapt many of the discretization methods described in the ph.d .",

    "the length ( or period ) of the unperturbed vortex is taken to be @xmath34 = 1 mm .",
    "the oscillation amplitude of the vortex endpoint is kept small enough to avoid reconnections and to keep the configuration such that we can always write the vortex configuration , described by coordinates @xmath35 and @xmath36 as a sum of different kelvin modes : @xmath37 the wave vector for mode @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 . during simulations the fourier components @xmath40 are determined by using a fft . since the vortex filament model",
    "does not automatically keep the points equally distributed along the @xmath7-axis we unify the grid before fourier transformation by using a second order interpolation .",
    "the error here is negligible since the difference from the uniform grid is small , provided that the grid unification is done frequently enough .",
    "the power dissipated due to mutual friction can be estimated by calculating @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is force on a vortex due to mutual friction and @xmath43 is the magnus force , both given per unit length ( see refs .  [ ] ) .",

    "the spectrum is symmetric with respect to modes @xmath38 and @xmath45 , therefore only positive modes are plotted . at least our low resolution calculations indicate that the absolute value for the kelvin amplitude depends linearly on the drive amplitude .",
    "this was verified by increasing and decreasing the drive amplitude by a factor of five . in this respect",
    "our results differ from ref .",
    "[ ] , where the kelvin amplitude was observed to be independent of the drive amplitude . since the input power is proportional to the square of the drive amplitude one would expect that also the kelvin amplitude should increase when the drive amplitude is increased . especially in the zero temperature limit of ref .",
    "[ ] this should be the case , since all the dissipated energy must be cascaded to the high-@xmath1 region ( where the modes were artificially damped ) . if the absolute amplitude of the spectrum would remain constant , then also the energy flow rate and the power dissipated would have to remain constant .",

    "this will cause a cusp in the vortex near the pinning site and is a more likely the reason for this spectrum bending near the resolution limit .",
    "this is additionally supported by a simulation where we pin , not only one point , but three neighbouring ones .",
    "this changes the spectrum near the resolution limit quite dramatically , but elsewhere the spectrum is almost unchanged .",
    "therefore , we expect that experimentally the obtained kelvin spectrum should realize for length scales larger that the size of the pinning point . for example , the diameter of the vibrating wire can be of order one micron and the pinning size even much smaller . to consider length scales of order ( and smaller ) than the pinning point",
    ", one should take into account the geometry more precisely .",
    "one option is that the obtained spectrum has nothing to do with the kelvin cascade , but is simply a result of way to drive the vortex . by shaking the endpoints",
    "one forces an additional small u - shape form in the vortex .",
    "for example , a parabolic shape would result a spectum with @xmath53 , when intepreted as sum of kelvin waves .",
    "generally the obtained kelvin spectrum is much smoother than , for example , obtained in refs . [ ] .",
    "we do not need to smooth it by averaging over different @xmath1-values .",
    "the time average is only needed to average out the oscillations that are due to drive .",
    "the smoothness of the spectrum is a general property that we have observed in many cases where the vortex is driven either by pinning or using a nonuniform velocity profile .",
    "if we drive the vortex in the @xmath1-space or if the drive is turned off and the vortex is allowed relax on its own the spectrum becomes much more irregular .",
    "an interesting point in the simulations is that there appears no m.f .",
    "dissipation dependent cutoff at high k - values , even when using a relatively high value 0.1 for @xmath30 .",
    "this is due to the spatially peaked drive and due to the fact that we are fixing the oscillation amplitude and not the power . by improving the numerical resolution ,",
    "the power dissipated due to mutual friction ( which equals the input power ) increases quite rapidly with the number of kelvin modes present , that is determined by our resolution .",
    "one should remember that the number of modes should be limited by a physical cutoff determined by the vortex core size . at smaller scales ,",
    "at least , the type of dissipation should change from m.f .",
    "dissipation to something else ( i.e. phonons in case of @xmath0he ) .",
    "however , the vortex filament formulation does not allow us to approach this limit properly .    to see how fast the power dissipated increases with the number of kelvin modes we additionally determined the power dissipated due to mutual friction by populating a vortex of length @xmath34 = 1 mm with kelvin waves , using up to 131072 discretization points on a vortex .",
    "we used the spectrum @xmath54 and included kelvin waves up to some maximum mode @xmath55 , which corresponds to a cutoff scale @xmath56 .",
    "we observed no saturation in the dissipated power for @xmath57 , at least for kelvin - spectra reaching modes up to @xmath55 @xmath58 8000 , which correspond to cutoff scales of order @xmath59 @xmath60 m .",
    "for @xmath61 the dissipated power might saturate as seen in fig .",
    "[ f.pmf ] , where the power dissipated is plotted as a function of @xmath55 for a few different kw - spectra .",
    "a simple estimate , using local induction approximation where @xmath62 , gives that the power converges only when @xmath63 .     for different spectra @xmath54 .",
    "from top to bottom @xmath47 = 1.7 , 1.833 , 2.0 , and 2.5 . ]    the dissipated power depends linearly of the m.f .",
    "parameter @xmath30 and , for small amplitudes , quadratically on the amplitude of the kelvin waves . for a wide range of scales",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ f.pmf ] that the power dissipated due to m.f .",
    "is approximately given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 depends at least on the amplitude of the kws .",
    "we determined that @xmath66 1.37 for the kozik - svistunov@xcite spectrum ( @xmath47 = 17/10 ) and @xmath66 1.12 for the lvov - nazarenko@xcite spectrum ( @xmath47 = 11/6 ) .",
    "the above equation implies that , if the @xmath67 is kept fixed by the drive and the spectrum is assumed to change only by a different ( sharp ) cutoff scale @xmath68 , any change in @xmath30 from @xmath69 to @xmath70 results in a corresponding change in @xmath68 from @xmath71 to @xmath72 which are related as @xmath73 since the exponent @xmath74 is still quite close to 1 , any change in @xmath30 will cause a similar change in the cutoff scale .",
    "since the kelvin wave cascade is expected to be a quite inefficient method for transferring energy to smaller scales , one might expect a bottleneck to appear in the energy transfer rate if the input power is too large .",
    "no such effect was observed in these simulations .",
    "unfortunately , the ideal case to observe this effect : low temperature and high drive , is more demanding numerically and typically results in a failure to present the vortex configuration as a fourier series ( which somewhat indicates an accumulation of kelvin waves ) .",
    "after several attempts to generate a steady state , we can say that the current one is one of the easiest where the steady state can be obtained with reasonable effort .",
    "it seems apparent that the kelvin spectrum might depend on the way it is driven / damped , but this analysis deserves a separate publication .",
