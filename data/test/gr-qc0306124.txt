    "loop quantum gravity @xcite aims at quantization of the gravitational field without relying on a background metric , while respecting the 3 + 1 dimensional nature of spacetime .",
    "this approach is based on ashtekar s new canonical variables @xcite which reduce the constraints to a polynomial form .",
    "note that the configuration space variables are connections rather than components of the metrical tensor .    upon quantization ,",
    "geometrical quantities like area or volume become operators acting on the hilbert space .",
    "area operators are especially interesting , since their spectral properties rendered possible recently testing the theory , namely , near black holes correspondence with the bekenstein - hawking entropy@xcite in the quasiclassical limit has been established@xcite .",
    "it is a technically important feature of the theory that , by using the so called loop representation , the hilbert space is spanned by the spin network states .",
    "such a state is characterized by a graph , whose edges are labelled by irreducible su(2 ) representations ( or , correspondingly , by integer or half - integer numbers ) and whose vertices lie on a given surface ( whose area is to be characterized ) .",
    "vertices are labelled by zero ( unit respresentation of su(2 ) ) if gauge invariant states are to be considered ( like in this paper ) .",
    "edges can be grouped according to their position with respect to the given surface .",
    "hence , an edge can be of type @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 , corresponding to up , down and tangential orientation .",
    "irreducible representations on edges emanating from the same vertex and being of the same type should be multiplied directly and the product should be subsequently decomposed to irreducible representations .",
    "a state is labelled also by one of these irreducible representations ( for each vertex and each edge type ) . thus , to each vertex there belongs a triple @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "these are not quite independent , as it is required that the decomposition of the direct product @xmath6 should contain the unit representation .",
    "in the present paper we study the spectral properties of the area operator numerically . actually a lot is known about its eigenvalues and eigenstates analytically.@xcite each spin network state is an eigenstate of the area operator .",
    "the eigenvalues are explicitly expressed as ( with a sum over the vertices ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the planck length and @xmath9 for the immirzi parameter whose value is argued to be @xmath10 @xcite . note that for this latter value the bekenstein - hawking black hole entropy can be obtained from the theory .",
    "our aim here to study the spectrum numerically , i.e. , to make it numerically transparent what the formulae yield .",
    "as long as just the eigenvalues are of interest , it is enough to specify the triple @xmath11 for each vertex , the only restriction being that @xmath12 and @xmath13 run over all integer and half - integer number , while @xmath14 runs from @xmath15 to @xmath16 in unit steps . in the actual calculation",
    "a maximal value @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath13 was applied and checked subsequently whether the spectrum changed if @xmath17 was further increased .",
    "moreover , because of the symmetric role of @xmath18 and @xmath13 , it was enough to consider the case when @xmath19 .",
    "after having the eigenvalues , they have been sorted .",
    "the eigenvalues versus their sequential number are displayed in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "if plotting the exponential of the eigenvalues , the curve becomes asymptotically a straight line ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] . ) .",
    "thus , we have asymptotically    @xmath20    with    @xmath21    certainly , for small sequential numbers @xmath22 the asymptotical expression becomes meaningless .",
    "the spectrum is discrete , but the mean nearest level spacing decreases for increasing eigenvalues .",
    "it is also clear , that the spectrum is not bounded from above .",
    "the largest nearest level spacing occurs between zero ( the smallest eigenvalue ) and the next one , which is @xmath23@xcite .",
    "in order to get the density of states , one also needs to know the multiplicities of the eigenvalues .",
    "this can be calculated for a given number of vertices , edges and maximal value @xmath17 .",
    "if the eigenvalue @xmath24 has the multiplicity @xmath25 , then the density of states may be expressed formally as    @xmath26    one may smoothen this density by calculating its convolution with some function @xmath27 to get    @xmath28    the multiplicities were calculated as follows . in the one vertex case the irreducible representations on the edges of the same type must be directly multiplied and subsequently decomposed to irreducible representations again , to get the numbers @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . to get the multiplicity associated with these numbers ( say , @xmath3 )",
    ", one can perform the standard procedure of adding angular momenta .",
    "this is the following .",
    "suppose that the irreducible representations on the type u edges are labelled by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , ... @xmath31 .",
    "i case of one edge , one has a multiplicity of @xmath32 . for two edges one has to decompose the direct product @xmath33 into irreducible representations .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 ranges from @xmath35 to @xmath36 . the corresponding multiplicity ( since a given @xmath34 appears only once ) is again @xmath37 . for more than two edges one can multiply directly the further irreducible representations ( one by one ) with the decomposition obtained in the previous step .",
    "now , however , at a given level one may get the same irreducible representation @xmath34 in several way .",
    "therefore , if we are to decompose the product @xmath38 , and a resulting irreducible representation is @xmath39 ( certainly @xmath40 ) , then the multiplicity of @xmath39 has to be increased by @xmath41    after the multiplicity associated with @xmath3 and @xmath4 has been obtained , the total multiplicity corresponding to the vertex is @xmath42 note that the multiplicity accociated with the type t edges is simply @xmath43 , because @xmath5 has to arise in the decomposition of the product @xmath44 .    in case of several vertices",
    "one proceeds as follows .",
    "multiplicities corresponding to different vertices must be multiplied together , while the eigenvalues ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) add up . if the same eigenvalue arises from different graphs , the corresponding multiplicities add up . as a consequence ,",
    "if the density of states is @xmath46 for one vertex , it will be @xmath47 for two vertices , and @xmath48 for v vertices .",
    "numerically we obtained that the one vertex density of states @xmath46 follows asymptotically a power law ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , namely , @xmath49 roughly independently of @xmath17 and @xmath50 ( maximal number of edges ) .        for several vertices we obtained that the density of states is asymptotically an exponential ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , @xmath51        eq.([gv ] ) looks a bit contradictory in view of eq.([konv ] ) , since a convolution of power laws yields power law again .",
    "it turns out , however , that one has to take into account the discreteness of the spectrum , too .",
    "we checked this in terms of a simple model of the one vertex density of states .",
    "this contained an isolated zero eigenvalue , followed by a gap , and then by a continuous power law behavior .",
    "taking the convolution of this model density of states , we were able to reproduce the approximately exponential behavior of @xmath52 .",
    "note that the proportionality constants did depend on @xmath17 ( maximal index of irreducible representations on an edge ) and @xmath50 ( maximal number of edges emanating from a vertex ) , but the exponents did not .",
    "we presented a numerical study of the spectrum of the area operator .",
    "especially , we calculated the lowest 37000 eigenvalues , and found numerically the logarithmic asymtotic formula ( [ ev ] ) . for the density of states we obtained the power law ( [ g1 ] ) in case of one vertex , and the exponential law ( [ gv ] ) in case of several vertices .",
    "we explained the connection between these two cases .",
    "it is remarkable that the spectral properties are rather independent of @xmath17 and @xmath50 ( even of @xmath53 ) , exhibiting a kind of scaling behavior .",
    "another interesting observation is that in the general ( i.e. @xmath54 ) case the density of states is exponential , making possible a formulation of thermodynamics , but leading to an upper bound for the possible temperatures .",
    "let us note that no constraints has been used throughout ."
