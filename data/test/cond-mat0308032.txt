    "graded materials , whose material properties can vary continuously in space , are abundant in nature .",
    "these materials have attracted much interest as one of the advanced inhomogeneous composite materials in various engineering applications  @xcite . with the advent of fabrication techniques , these materials can be well produced to tailor their properties for specific needs via the design of the material and microstructure gradients .",
    "such a design makes graded materials quite different in physical properties from the homogeneous materials and other conventional composite materials .",
    "moreover , the composite media consisting of graded inclusions can be more useful and interesting than those of homogeneous inclusions .",
    "although various theories have been established to investigate the optical and dielectric properties of the composite media of homogeneous inclusions  @xcite , they fail to deal with the inhomogeneous composites of graded inclusions . recently ,",
    "a first - principles approach  @xcite and a differential effective dipole approximation  @xcite have been presented in order to investigate the dielectric response of graded materials .",
    "the problem becomes more complicated by the presence of nonlinearity in realistic composites . besides inhomogeneity , such nonlinearity plays also an important role in the effective material properties of composite media  @xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary to establish a new theory to study the effective nonlinear properties of graded composite media .",
    "in fact , the introduction of dielectric gradation profiles in nonlinear composites is able to provide an alternative way to control the local field fluctuation , and hence let us obtain the desired effective nonlinear response .",
    "in fact , the previous one - shell model  @xcite and multi - shell model  @xcite , which were used to study the effective nonlinear optical property , can be seen as an initial model of graded inclusions . in this paper , we will put forth a nonlinear differential effective dipole approximation ( ndeda ) to investigate the effective linear and nonlinear dielectric properties of composite media containing nonlinear graded spherical particles ( inclusions ) . for such particles ,",
    "the linear and nonlinear physical properties will continuously vary along their radius .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the model and define briefly the effective linear dielectric constant and third - order nonlinear susceptibility . in section iii ,",
    "the ndeda is presented to investigate the effective linear dielectric constant and third - order nonlinear susceptibility of nonlinear graded composite media in the dilute limit . in section iv ,",
    "based on a first - principles approach , we derive the exact solutions for composite media having power - law gradation profiles inside the inclusions , which is followed by the numerical results in section v. finally , some conclusion and discussion is shown in section vi .",
    "let us consider a nonlinear composite system , in which identical graded spherical inclusions with radius @xmath0 , are randomly embedded in a linear host medium of dielectric constant @xmath1 .",
    "the local constitutive relation between the displacement @xmath2 and the electric field @xmath3 inside the graded particle is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are , respectively , the linear dielectric constant and third - order nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "note both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are radial functions . here",
    "we assume that the weak nonlinearity condition is satisfied  @xcite .",
    "in other words , the contribution of the second ( nonlinear ) part [ @xmath7 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) is much less than that of the first ( linear ) part @xmath5 .",
    "we restrict further our discussion to the quasi - static approximation , under which the whole composite medium can be regarded as an effective homogeneous one with effective linear dielectric constant @xmath8 and effective third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath9 . to show the definitions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , we have  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the spatial average , and @xmath12 is the external applied field along @xmath13 axis .    the effective linear dielectric constant @xmath8 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the volume fraction of the graded particles and the subscript stands for the linear local field [ i.e. , obtained for the same system but with @xmath16 .    in view of the existence of nonlinearity inside the graded particles ,",
    "@xmath9 can then be written as  @xcite @xmath17    in the next section , we will develop a ndeda ( nonlinear differential effective dipole approximation ) , in an attempt to derive the equivalent linear dielectric constant @xmath18 and third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath19 of the nonlinear graded inclusions .",
    "then , the effective linear dielectric constant and third - order nonlinear susceptibility of the composite media of nonlinear graded inclusions will be derived accordingly in the dilute limit .",
    "to establish the ndeda , we first mimic the gradation profile by a multi - shell constriction .",
    "that is , we build up the dielectric profile by adding shells gradually  @xcite .",
    "we start with an infinitesimal spherical core with linear dielectric constant @xmath20 and third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath21 , and keep on adding spherical shells with linear dielectric constant @xmath5 and third - order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath6 at radius @xmath22 , until @xmath23 is reached . at radius @xmath22 , the inhomogeneous spherical particle with space - dependent dielectric gradation profiles @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be replaced by a _",
    "homogenous _ sphere with the equivalent dielectric properties @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    "the _ homogeneous _",
    "sphere should induce the same dipole moment as the original inhomogeneous sphere .",
    "next , we add to the sphere a spherical shell of infinitesimal thickness @xmath26 , with dielectric constant @xmath5 and nonlinear susceptibility @xmath6 . in this sense , the coated inclusions is composed of a spherical core with radius @xmath22 , linear dielectric constant @xmath24 and nonlinear susceptibility @xmath25 , and a shell with outermost radius @xmath27 , linear dielectric constant @xmath5 and nonlinear susceptibility @xmath6 . since these coated inclusions are randomly embedded in a linear host medium , under the quasi - static approximation",

    "we are now in a position to evaluate the ndeda . for the comparison between the first - principles approach and the ndeda",
    ", we first perform numerical calculations for the case where the dielectric constant exhibits power - law gradation profiles @xmath58 , while the third - order nonlinear susceptibility shows two model gradation profiles : ( a ) linear profile @xmath74 , and ( b ) power - law profile @xmath76 . without loss of generality , we take @xmath78 and @xmath79 for numerical calculations .",
    "the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm is adopted to integrate the differential equations [ eqs .",

    "meanwhile , the initial core radius is set to be @xmath81 .",
    "it was verified that this step size guarantees accurate numerics .    in fig .",
    "1 , the effective linear dielectric constant ( @xmath8 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath82 for various indices @xmath83 .",
    "it is shown that @xmath8 exhibits a monotonic increase for increasing @xmath82 ( and decreasing @xmath83 ) .",
    "this can be understood by using the equivalent dielectric constant @xmath52 which increases as @xmath82 increases ( @xmath83 decreases ) .",
    "moreover , the excellent agreement between the ndeda [ eq .",
    "( [ tartar1 ] ) ] and the first - principles approach [ eq .  ( [ exact1 ] ) ] is shown as well .",
    "next , the effective third - order nonlinear susceptibility ( @xmath9 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath82 for the linear gradation profile @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and for the power - law profile @xmath76 ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we find that the effective nonlinear susceptibility decreases for increasing @xmath82 .",
    "the reason is that , as mentioned above , for larger @xmath82 , the graded inclusions possess larger equivalent dielectric constant , and the local field inside the nonlinear inclusions will become more weak , which results in a weaker effective nonlinear susceptibility ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition , increasing @xmath83 leads generally to increasing @xmath9 , and such a trend is clearly observed at large @xmath82 .",
    "again , we obtain the excellent agreement between the first - principles approach [ eqs .",
    "( [ exactee1 ] )  and  ( [ exactxe1 ] ) ] and the ndeda [ eqs .",
    "( [ tartar1 ] )  and  ( [ ndeda1 ] ) ] .    in what follows",
    ", we investigate the surface plasma resonance effect on the metal - dielectric composite .",
    "we adopt the drude - like dielectric constant for graded metal particles , namely , @xmath84},\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the radius - dependent plasma frequency and damping coefficient , respectively . for the sake of simplicity , set @xmath49 to be independent of @xmath22 , in an attempt to emphasize the enhancement of the effective optical nonlinearity , and @xmath87 ( the dielectric constant of water ) .",
    "we assume further @xmath85 to be @xmath88 this form is quite physical for @xmath89 , since the center of grains can be better metallic so that @xmath85 is larger , while the boundary of the grain may be poorer metallic so that @xmath85 is much smaller .",
    "such the variation can also appear because of the temperature effect  @xcite .",
    "for small particles , we have the radius - dependent @xmath86 as  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 stands for the damping coefficient in the bulk material . here",
    "@xmath92 is a constant which is related to the fermi velocity @xmath93 . in this case",
    ", the exact solution being predicted by a first - principles approach is absent .",
    "fortunately , we can resort to the ndeda instead .    in fig.3 , we plot the optical absorption [ @xmath94 , the modulus of the effective third - order optical nonlinearity enhancement ( @xmath95 ) and the figure of merit ( @xmath96 ) versus the incident angular frequency @xmath97 . for various variance slopes",
    "@xmath98 , large surface plasma resonance peaks can appear around @xmath99 as expected .",
    "however , when the radius dependence of @xmath85 is taken into account ( i.e. , @xmath100 ) , besides a sharp peak , a broad continuous resonant bands in the high frequency region is clearly observed . the broad spectra result from the effect of radius dependence of the plasma frequency . in ref.@xcite , we found that , when the shell model is considered , there should be a broad continuous spectrum around the large pole in the spectral density function .",
    "in fact , the graded particles under consideration can be regarded as a certain limit of multi shells , which hence should lead to broader spectra in @xmath101 , @xmath95 as well as @xmath102 .",
    "in addition , we note that , with increasing @xmath98 , both the surface plasma frequency and the center of resonant bands are red - shifted .",
    "in particular , the resonant bands can become more broad due to strong inhomogeneity of the particles . from the figure ,",
    "we conclude that , although the third - order optical nonlinearity is always accompanied with the optical absorption , the figure of merit in the high frequency region is still attractive due to the presence of _ weak _ optical absorption .",
    "thus , we believe that graded particles may have potential applications in obtaining the optimal figure of merit , and make the composite media more realistic for practical applications .",
    "finally , we focus on the effect of @xmath86 on the nonlinear optical property in fig .  5 .",
    "as evident from the results , the variation of @xmath103 plays an important role in the magnitude of the effective optical properties , particularly at the surface plasma resonance frequency .",
    "here a few comments are in order . in this work ,",
    "we have developed an ndeda ( nonlinear differential effective dipole approximation ) to calculate the effective linear and nonlinear dielectric responses of composite media containing nonlinear graded inclusions .",
    "the results obtained from the ndeda are compared with the exact solutions derived from a first - principles approach for the power - law dielectric gradation profiles , and the excellent agreement between them has been shown .",
    "we should remark that the exact solutions are also obtainable for the linear dielectric gradation profiles with small slopes ( the derivation not shown here ) . in this case , the excellent agreement between the two methods can be shown as well since the ndeda is valid indeed for arbitrary gradation profiles . in general , the exact solution is quite few in realistic composite research , and thus our ndeda can be used as a benchmark .",
    "it is instructive to develop the first - principles approach to nonlinear graded composites .",
    "the perturbation approach  @xcite in weakly nonlinear composites as well as the variational approach  @xcite in strongly nonlinear composites are just suitable for this problem .",
    "the ndeda is strictly valid in the dilute limit . to achieve the strong optical nonlinearity enhancement , we need possibly nonlinear inclusions with high volume fractions . in this connection , the effect of the volume fraction is expected to cause a further broadening of the resonant peak , and possibly , a desired separation of the optical absorption peak from the nonlinearity enhancement due to mutual interactions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of particular interest to generalize the ndeda for treating the case of high volume fractions .    to one",
    "s interest , the ndeda can be applied to biological cells .",
    "since the interior of biological cells is often inhomogeneous and nonlinear in nature , they can be treated as particles having dielectric gradation profiles  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the case of cell membranes containing mobile charges introduced by the adsorbed hydrophobic ions , the local dielectric anisotropy occurs naturally , and should be expected to play a role  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is also interesting to see what happens to the ndeda as one takes into account the local dielectric anisotropy .",
    "the resultant anisotropic ndeda will help to investigate the ac electrokinetic phenomena of biological cells  @xcite .",
    "work along this direction is in progress .    to sum up , we put forth an ndeda and a first - principles approach for investigating the optical responses of nonlinear graded spherical particles . the excellent agreement between the two methods",
    "has been shown . as an application",
    ", we applied the ndeda to discuss the surface plasma resonance effect on the effective linear and nonlinear optical properties like the optical absorption , the optical nonlinearity enhancement , and the figure of merit .",
    "it is found that the dielectric gradation profile can be used to control the surface plasma resonance and achieve the large figure of merit in the high - frequency region , where the optical absorption is quite small .",
