    "the existence and nature of melting transitions in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems remains a topic of interest and uncertainty in both theory and experiments .",
    "in particular , the melting of the vortex lattice in a thin film superconductor has received much attention . a continuous melting transition from an abrikosov lattice to a vortex liquid via a phase of hexatic order , as in the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young ( kthny ) theory , was first proposed over fifteen years ago.@xcite a `` transition '' in the current - voltage response of thin film superconductors has been seen in several experiments.@xcite the vortex system becomes depinned above some transition temperature ( the depinned vortices will dissipate energy as they move , leading to an ohmic response ) and the rise of the resistivity of the film is presumed to be caused by the melting of the vortex lattice",
    ". however , it seems that this transition temperature varies with the strength of the pinning centers in the thin films . for films of amorphous nbo",
    "the pinning is weak and no features can be detected in the current - voltage characteristics which may be attributed to a `` transition '' .",
    "this has been interpreted as being due to the absence of the abrikosov vortex lattice.@xcite    the superconducting state arises from macroscopic correlations in the phase of the cooper pair wave function , or equivalently the ginzburg - landau order parameter .",
    "this phase coherence is usually a consequence of off - diagonal long range order ( odlro ) , i.e.  non - vanishing @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the superconducting order parameter .",
    "it has been predicted that thermal excitations of the shear modes of the vortex lattice should destroy odlro in the crystalline state and the length scale over which phase coherence persists has been estimated.@xcite    oneill and moore have performed monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of thin film superconductors within the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation using a spherical geometry to minimize finite size boundary effects.@xcite no freezing transition out of the vortex liquid phase was found in the temperature region investigated . the correlation function associated with the positions of the vortices",
    "was calculated and the associated length scale of these lattice - like correlations was found to diverge only in the zero temperature limit . it was noted that this happened on a similar length scale over which there was expected to be phase coherence from the arguments of refs .  and  .",
    "in the work of oneill and moore , the superconducting film existed on the surface of a sphere , and this geometry is the one employed here .",
    "the magnetic field perpendicular to the surface is generated by a magnetic monopole placed at the center of the sphere.@xcite the strength of the monopole must be quantized to have a well defined superconducting order parameter , but the strength of the field at the surface may be continuously varied by changing the radius of the sphere . the lll approximation , which assumes an infinite magnetic screening length , works well in the 2d case where the effective screening length is @xmath2 because of the magnetic field outside the superconductor.@xcite @xmath3 becomes large as the film thickness @xmath4 is reduced ; @xmath5 is the bulk magnetic penetration length .",
    "it is often the case that @xmath3 is greater than the film dimensions for small @xmath4 .",
    "more recently , strong evidence for a first order transition at a finite temperature in an alternative finite size approximation with quasi - periodic boundary conditions ( qp ) on an infinite plane has come from mc simulations.@xcite this model has a periodic amplitude of the order parameter and a fixed change in the phase as a unit cell containing @xmath6 vortices is crossed ( the change in phase depends on the choice of gauge ) .",
    "the quasi - periodicity in the phase places some constraints on the motion of the vortices , but it is not obvious that this will change the thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "the observed transition temperature is within the range investigated on the sphere .",
    "this raises the question of whether or not there really is no transition on the sphere .",
    "if so , then what are the reasons that different boundary conditions give different results ?",
    "if there is a freezing transition , at least on the plane , does this contradict the theoretical prediction of no odlro at finite temperatures ?",
    "apparently not , as the work of sasik , stroud and tesanovic@xcite ( sst ) has concluded that in the thermodynamic limit even the low temperature state below the first order transition has no odlro , despite the presence of `` bragg peaks '' in the correlations of the order parameter density ( the peaks will not be delta - functions but the algebraic singularities expected for a 2d crystalline system@xcite ) .",
    "these conclusions of sst are taken as support for the `` charge - density wave '' phase ( with a modulation in the cooper pair density , but no odlro ) proposed by tesanovic.@xcite    in this work we again fail to find a phase transition in the spherical geometry .",
    "we have investigated the correlations associated with both the _ phase _ and the _ amplitude _ of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "one advantage of the spherical geometry is that the liquid state may be investigated over a larger range of temperatures .",
    "this has allowed us to compare the growing length scales of the phase and amplitude correlations over a large variation in temperature .",
    "section  [ sec : method ] contains the formulation of our model . in section",
    "[ sec : pert ] it is shown how the high temperature perturbation theory on the spherical geometry gives the same free energy per vortex as the conventional theory in the thermodynamic limit . in section",
    "[ sec : ground ] we describe how the ground state of the vortex system on the sphere is affected by the necessity of containing twelve disclination defects within the triangular lattice .",
    "we have previously concluded that these defects with long range strains will give a finite energy cost per vortex relative to the flat plane ground state even in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite however , the presence of dislocation defects were not considered , and these can screen the strains of the disclinations to recover the thermodynamic limit of the triangular lattice on a flat plane .",
    "this screening is described in the framework of elasticity theory , and the numerical evidence for dislocations in the ground state is reexamined . in section  [ sec :",
    "density ] our calculations on the four - point density correlation function of the vortex liquid are shown .",
    "this is followed by our investigations on the phase coherence in section  [ sec : phase ] .",
    "the spherical geometry is in principle realizable using the end of a long thin solenoid to approximate the field from a monopole and placing it inside a spherical superconducting film .",
    "however there would always be a problem in the placement of the solenoid which would lead to a large scale inhomogeneity in the field strength at the spherical surface .",
    "additional simulations are described in section  [ sec : inhom ] , where we add just such an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",

    "exactly the same diagrams appear in the free energy expansion for the spherical geometry as those for the plane .",
    "the contribution of each diagram with @xmath64 vertices to the coefficient of the @xmath64th order term of the expansion is a product of a combinatorial factor and the integral / sum over the `` momenta '' along each line of the interactions at each vertex .",

    "is @xmath71 . so the contribution to the free energy to @xmath64th order approaches that on the plane as long as @xmath64 is much less than the system size @xmath6 .",
    "although we have not verified this for more complex diagrams , we expect a similar result .",
    "this is because the interactions at each vertex have only @xmath68 ( and higher power ) corrections on the sphere from the interactions on the plane , so with @xmath64 vertices in a diagram , there should be a total correction of order @xmath72 .",
    "therefore as long as the perturbation theory is useful ( ie . on the high temperature side of any phase transition ) the thermodynamic limit on the sphere should be the same as that for the flat plane . intuitively , it is also reasonable that the free energy per vortex in the liquid phase should be the same on the flat plane and on the sphere . in the liquid phase ,",

    "the ground state of the lll vortex system on an infinite plane was long ago discovered to be the triangular lattice.@xcite this is also the ground state on the finite systems used in the qp simulations when commensurate boundary conditions are chosen . however , on a sphere the closest configuration the vortices can make to an ideal triangular lattice must contain twelve `` disclinations '' , i.e.  twelve vortices that only have five nearest neighbors .",
    "we have previously studied the ground states by numerical minimization of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) for different system sizes.@xcite the following conclusions were made : there exist some values of @xmath6 ( magic numbers ) for which the ground state has a lower energy than nearby values , and the energies as @xmath73 do not seem to converge to the infinite plane value .",
    "extrapolation of our numerical results gives an extra energy on the sphere in this large @xmath6 limit of @xmath74% of the ground state energy per vortex on the infinite plane .",
    "the vortex configurations of these ground states make up a triangular network , but with twelve five - coordinated centers .",
    "the result that as @xmath73 the ground states do not look the same as for an infinite plane may be explained by the presence of the disclinations ( five - coordinated centers ) , which are defects with long range strains.@xcite therefore there will always be a finite fraction of the vortex system that is distorted from an ideal triangular lattice .",
    "this is supported by calculations within elasticity theory ( which assumes only small distortions ) that give a similar finite energy cost of the distortions on a sphere in the large @xmath6 limit when an icosahedral arrangement of the disclinations is assumed.@xcite    this result of an extra energy per vortex in the thermodynamic limit would be equally valid at finite temperatures as long as there is a non - zero shear modulus ( ie . in a solid phase ) .",
    "if it were true there could be a paradox : imagine a 2d system with a continuous phase transition from a liquid to a crystalline solid phase . above the transition",
    "the free energies per vortex have been shown in section  [ sec : pert ] to be the same on the sphere and the plane and so this transition must remain at the same temperature in each case .",
    "as at the transition the free energy is continuous , then the free energies in the solid state must also be equal .    in fact , one can do a better job on the ground states on the sphere by having a number of dislocations ( which are bound pairs of five - fold and seven - fold disclinations ) in addition to the twelve free disclinations .",
    "this means we have to take away the restriction that every vortex is six - fold coordinated other than the twelve five - fold centers used in the elasticity calculation of ref .  .",
    "there is no topological problem with this as one can pull an opposite pair of dislocations out of a perfect lattice .",
    "that extra dislocation defects may lower the energy may be seen in two different ways .",
    "first , the interaction energy between a dislocation and a disclination may be negative , depending on the direction of the dislocation and this interaction energy grows faster with system size than the self energy of the dislocation .",
    "alternatively , consider a region on a sphere bounded by three great circles that intersect at neighboring disclinations . even in the large @xmath6 limit this region will be distorted from a triangle ( all three of its angles will be @xmath75 ) and so a perfect triangular lattice in this region will be incommensurate with the boundaries , where a series of dislocations will occur .",
    "so we have a picture of a ground state in the large @xmath6 limit made up of twenty regions of perfect lattice , but with sides containing dislocations , and corners containing disclinations .    there are still competing effects which discourage dislocations , and which may explain why they were not seen in ref .  .",
    "first there is the curvature of the sphere which favors the distortions of a disclination , but which decreases as @xmath76 .",
    "second , there is the positive self energy of a dislocation , which is generally expected to increase as the logarithm of the system size.@xcite third there is the interaction between two dislocations which is directional , and approximately proportional to the logarithm of the distance between them . to estimate the density of dislocations needed to reduce the strain energy of the disclinations we use the framework of elasticity theory .",
    "the elasticity theory of twelve disclinations on a sphere is described in ref .  .",
    "the method is briefly explained here and then generalized to allow the inclusion of dislocations .",
    "we consider small strains from an ideal lattice , @xmath77 .",
    "these strains are related to a stress field by hooke s law , @xmath78 . for the lll system",
    "the elastic constant @xmath5 diverges ( the system is incompressible ) and the shear modulus @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 .",
    "the stress tensor has zero divergence which allows the problem to be expressed in terms of the airy stress function , @xmath81 , defined by @xmath82 .",
    "five - fold disclinations are defined by the change in bond angle by @xmath83 when a path encircles one such defect .",
    "dislocations , on the other hand , are defined by their burgers vector , but they are also equivalent to a disclination dipole pair .",
    "the stress field corresponding to a particular configuration of these topological defects is given by the solutions to the biharmonic equation on a sphere : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the 2d young s modulus which in the lll system is given by @xmath86 .",

    "the energy of a given configuration is @xmath89 where the integrals are over the surface of the sphere .",
    "we will need to use coordinate frames rotated so that the reference axis passes through the defect .",

    "these energy measurements ( see fig  [ fig : circ ] ) have revealed no hysteresis on the scale observed in the qp system for temperatures greater than @xmath328 , and hence no evidence for a phase transition .",
    "= 8 cm     +      it seems that from a theoretical point of view there are three possible scenarios for the behavior of thin film superconductors in the presence of a magnetic field : a ) the standard picture of kthny melting of a 2d crystal where a dislocation mediated continuous transition occurs between a low temperature state with quasi - crystalline order and a high temperature liquid or hexatic phase ; b ) a first order transition where the liquid free energy becomes lower than the solid phase before kthny melting takes place ( as is seen in qp simulations ) ; c ) the absence of a distinct low - temperature state , but where the correlation lengths of the liquid diverge as @xmath329 ( this is the prediction of high order perturbation theory from the high temperature side , and is consistent with the numerical simulations on the sphere ) .",
    "we now discuss some experimental results and their implications for these possibilities .",
    "a melting transition of the flux lattice in in / in0@xmath330 thin films was observed by gammel _",
    "et al._@xcite the zero field limit of the transition was consistent with the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the absence of external fields , though the magnetic field dependence of the melting line did not satisfy the predictions of the kthny theory .",
    "the measured transitions were mainly at low fields , so the relevance of our simulations here are doubtful .    in the experiments of berghuis _",
    "et al._@xcite the current voltage response was measured of amorphous nb@xmath331ge@xmath330 films at different fields and temperatures .",
    "a drop to zero in the a.c .",
    "ohmic resistivity is seen , for example at fields @xmath332 at @xmath333 , though the d.c .",
    "response remains finite ( ie .",
    "the critical current is zero . ) .",
    "this drop is attributed to a kthny transition consistent with the temperature and film thickness dependence of the melting field . a similar conclusion is made by yazdani _",
    "et al._@xcite from a.c .",
    "measurements on films of amorphous mo@xmath334ge@xmath335 .",
    "it should be emphasized that these a.c .",
    "measurements at a given frequency @xmath336 probe structural changes of the vortex system over a restricted length scale.@xcite while this is useful to measure properties independent of the presence of a large pinning length , one would expect even in the absence of a phase transition to see a large drop in the resistivity at fixed frequency when the relaxation times grow larger than @xmath337 . in numerical simulations on the sphere,@xcite the plastic time scale",
    "was observed to increase as @xmath338 and we would expect a sharp drop when @xmath339 .",
    "in contrast to the above experiments , measurements by nikulov _",
    "et al._@xcite on films of amorphous nbo@xmath330 with weak pinning have found no signatures of a resistive transition down to fields @xmath340 .",
    "this implies that the transitions observed previously are not universal properties of superconducting thin films .",
    "while the lack of a resistive drop may be attributed to the total absence of pinning , one would expect in the presence of a first order transition , where there is a discontinuous change in @xmath341 , that this would be observed as a step in the flux flow resistivity .",
    "thus the interpretation of these experiments remains controversial . while the kthny theory provides a useful framework to discuss flux lattice melting in two dimensions , its effects",
    "have only been observed over short length scales.@xcite as far as we know there has been no experimental indication of a first order transition in superconducting thin films . in principle , the results of these experiments can still be explained simply by the growing length scales and relaxation times of a vortex liquid in the absence of a phase transition .",
    "we have shown that the model with a spherical geometry remains in the vortex liquid phase , at least down to temperatures @xmath342 for system sizes up to @xmath343 .",
    "this could be due to the raised energy of the ground states because of the necessary presence of twelve disclinations in a triangular network over a sphere .",
    "however , we have made similar investigations on an alternative finite size model : considering the lll basis states on an infinite plane with a circular symmetric gauge and truncating the series to include only @xmath6 vortices.@xcite this system has a lower ground state energy per vortex than the infinite system and no disclinations , but we see the same length scales as in section  [ sec : phase ] for temperatures down to @xmath328 . the main evidence for a first order transition in the qp model is the double peak structure observed in the probability distribution of the internal energy at the transition .",
    "our investigations on the internal energy for both the sphere and the plane with circular coordinates have revealed no such signatures .",
    "the fact that the spherical system remains in the liquid phase down to low temperatures allows us to measure the variation of the correlations in the liquid state with temperature over a large regime .",
    "measurements in the liquid phase have the advantages that the system reaches equilibrium over a reasonable time scale at low temperatures . our measurements of the density correlations are consistent with those in the liquid phase using qp boundary conditions.@xcite the extracted length scales demonstrate an asymptotic linear dependence on @xmath198 .",
    "the scaling analysis of oneill and moore predicted that the _ phase coherence _",
    "length should grow as @xmath344 .",
    "our results for the phase coherence are consistent with this scaling form , and also demonstrate that in the liquid the phase and density correlations grow with identical temperature dependence .",
    "our results for the scaling of the phase correlations contradict the conclusions of sst , who claim that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath73 the phase coherence has a range only of the order of the lattice spacing in their `` solid '' phase .",
    "however , this discrepancy is really due to different definitions of what is meant by phase coherence .",
    "sst do not predict the growth of the length scale of phase correlations as the temperature goes to zero .",
    "although their results are claimed as evidence for the charge - density wave of tesanovic,@xcite a finite length scale that grows with decreasing temperature or even a power law form of odlro would still be consistent with this exotic phase .",
    "it seems unlikely to us that the low - temperature phase below a first order transition would have a shorter range of phase coherence than the liquid phase .",
    "if we measure the phase correlations without fixing any vortices , we also find no phase coherence beyond a length of one lattice spacing , due to the translational freedom of the liquid phase . in the solid phase of the qp model the vortex system appears to be fixed near one ground state due to the finite energy barrier between the @xmath6 ground states , and this allows phase coherence to be observed over a long range . as @xmath6 increases",
    ", there is a decrease in the range of phase coherence .",
    "these measurements by sst demonstrate just how strong the finite - size effects are in the qp simulations below the observed transition . without fixing the motion of any vortices ,",
    "the phase coherence should always have a trivial length scale of the inter - vortex spacing . by restricting the motion of a small number of vortices",
    ", we have been able to measure a more physically relevant phase correlation length that is consistent with the expected growth of order as the temperature is reduced .",
    "an interesting question remains as to whether a similarly defined phase coherence in the solid phase with qp boundary conditions would result in true long range order , or another length scale that also exhibits zero temperature scaling .    despite the differences in results from spherical and qp boundary conditions",
    ", our results from high temperature perturbation theory and on the ground states suggest that the thermodynamic limit will be the same on the sphere as the infinite flat plane .",
    "this contradicts the earlier statement of ref .   where the effect of allowing additional dislocation defects into the ground state was not considered .",
    "even so , the results on the ground states show how large system sizes must be for certain properties to approach the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a definite drawback on the sphere is the small effective system size compared to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the spherical geometry is perhaps not only relevant for simulational purposes .",
    "it is possible that an experiment could be constructed with an amorphous type - ii superconductor sputtered over the surface of a sphere , and one end of a long and thin solenoid inserted into the center to approximate the field from a monopole .",
    "in contrast an experimental realization of the qp boundary conditions is not possible ( these boundary conditions are primarily of interest in extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit of an infinite number of free vortices ) .",
    "we feel that the spherical geometry , with its property of translational invariance , remains a useful system for numerical simulations , especially to measure properties of the unpinned vortex liquid .",
    "an investigation into dynamical properties with a view to examining the length scales associated with non - local resistivity@xcite is planned , which would not be possible using qp boundary conditions due to the absence of full translational invariance of the vortex positions .",
    "we would like to acknowledge useful interactions with gianni blatter , tom blum , vadim geshkenbein , roman sasik and joonhyun yeo .",
    "mjwd would also like to thank han lee for the use of his source code and the epsrc for financial support .",
    "in this appendix we will show that the gl free energy hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) depends only on the positions of the zeros in the order parameter on the sphere .",

    "if @xmath348 when @xmath349 and @xmath350 then we may choose : @xmath351    now , the gl - lll free energy is a functional that depends only on the value of @xmath352 at each point on the sphere .",
    "if we can show that @xmath353 depends only on the relative position of the @xmath152th zero then the hamiltonian will be invariant with respect to coordinate rotations of all the zeros : @xmath354\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2}[1-\\cos{\\theta'(i)}]\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sin^2[\\theta'(i)/2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath355 is the polar angle measured from the axis through the @xmath152th zero to the point @xmath46 , defined by an analogous expression to eq .",
