    "in this paper we study the optimal stopping problems in an uncertain environment .",
    "the classical solution to the optimal stopping problems based on the dynamic programming principle assumes that there is a unique subjective prior distribution driving the reward process .",

    "in fact under the presence of the multiple possible distributions , a solution of the optimal stopping problem by maximization with respect to some subjective prior can not be reliable .",
    "instead , it is reasonable to view the multitude of possible distributions as a kind of _ model uncertainty risk _ which should be taken into account while formulating an optimal stopping problem . here",

    "convex risk measures have been extended to the concept of conditional convex risk measures @xmath20 at a future time @xmath21 which are specific functions on the space of financial risks with random outcomes ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . under some regularity conditions , they have a robust representation of the form ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
