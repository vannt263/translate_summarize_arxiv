    "stringent requirements of the quantum computation algorithms motivate studies of the consequences of the anisotropic exchange of a general form on quantum gates .",

    "@xcite in both views , it is of utter importance to know the strength and the form of the anisotropic exchange .",
    "since the spin - orbit interaction is weak , it is enough to answer the following question : what is the anisotropic exchange in the leading order ?",
    "surprisingly , arriving at the answer was not straightforward at all .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya@xcite interaction is of the first order in spin - orbit coupling .",
    "however , since it couples only states split by the isotropic exchange , it is necessary to consider also the second order anisotropic exchange terms to arrive at correct energies .",
    "@xcite ref . suggested such a hamiltonian , which was unitarily equivalent to the isotropic exchange hamiltonian , with the exchange energy renormalized in the second order .",
    "this was later revisited,@xcite with the following conclusion : in zero magnetic field , the two qubit hamiltonian is , up to the second order in the linear - in - momenta spin - orbit interaction , unitarily equivalent to the isotropic exchange hamiltonian in the weak coupling limit , with the unchanged exchange energy .",
    "further corrections appear in the third order . in the unitary operator providing the change of the basis , the spin - orbit interaction appears in the linear order .",
    "these results are a consequence of the special form of the spin - orbit interaction , which in the leading order leads to a spatially dependent spin rotation.@xcite    in the short version of this article,@xcite we derived the leading order anisotropic exchange terms which appear in a finite magnetic field .",

    "in addition to that , we supply the derivations , not presented in the short version ( sec .  [ derivation ] ) and a detailed account of our numerical method ( app .",
    "[ appendix ] ) .    the analytical pitfalls in evaluating the isotropic exchange are well known .",
    "@xcite on top of that , the anisotropic exchange is a ( very ) small correction to the exponentially sensitive isotropic exchange , and therefore it is involved to extract even numerically .",
    "our main conclusion here is that the presented analytical model is valid in all studied regimes .",
    "quantitatively , the effective parameters are usually within a factor of 2 from their counterparts derived from the numerically exact spectra .",
    "the main source of the discrepancy is the cubic dresselhaus term .",
    "surprisingly , in the most important regime for quantum dot spin qubits , namely the weak coupling , the heitler - london approximation works great for the anisotropic exchange , even though it fails badly for the isotropic one .",
