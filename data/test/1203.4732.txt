    "the relational data base model , introduced by codd in  @xcite , has been particularly successful since it is a mathematically elegant model well suited to describe almost all `` real world '' situations .",
    "since the query languages associated to such model ( the _ relational algebra _ and the _ relational calculus _ ) have a formal and simple definition , an interesting field of research is to study the expressive power of such language .",
    "codd  @xcite has proved that the relational algebra is equivalent to the _ relational calculus _ , in the sense that both query languages can compute the same set of relations .    a breakthrough in this field  @xcite has been a syntactic characterization of the set of relations that can be computed in a give data base .",
    "these results , also known as _ bp - completeness _ , are based on the principle of data independency from the physical representation : the information that can be extracted from the data base is completely determined at the logical level of such data base .",
    "this fact can be stated in a simple way : a relation @xmath0 can be computed from a data base @xmath1 if and only if all permutations over the elements of @xmath1 which preserve @xmath1 ( that is , all permutations that produce a data base isomorphic to @xmath1 ) , also preserve @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting interpretation of this property is that only the information given by the structure of the data can be used to differentiate data values ; consequently , a query is expressible if and only if it does not add any additional differentiation to the one initially available  @xcite .",
    "this idea can be rephrased by stating that the result of a query is invariant w.r.t .",
    "permutations of indistinguishable values ; such a permutation was captured with the notion of automorphism in  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath2-criterion is a natural requirement , it refers to properties of relations in a given data base instead of queries as a whole .",
    "we recall that a query is an expression of the query language that can be applied to different data bases leading to possibly different results .",
    "thus it has been extended to a property of queries as partial functions from data bases to data bases , which is known nowadays as _",
    "@xcite : it has been recognized as the capability of the calculus to preserve isomorphisms between data bases , rather than automorphisms .",
    "genericity is a common requirement for query languages and it is traditionally related to the _ data independence _",
    "principle that assumes that the data base is constructed over an abstract domain which is independent from the internal representation of data .",
    "subsequent research has shown that this approach to the analysis of the expressiveness of a query language has certain shortcomings @xcite , mainly when new data models , such as the object - based model , are introduced .",
    "other notions have been proposed to analyze properties of queries in some new models  @xcite pointing out the importance of extending genericity to be used in more complex models . in  @xcite languages",
    "are classified w.r.t .",
    "the degree of the use of the equality predicate , by analyzing the invariance property of queries under different mappings ( not necessarily isomorphisms ) over the data domain , which are compatible with the relational structure of the data base .",
    "subsequent advances in data base theory have led to different models that take into account the limitations of the relational model when it comes to describe complex situations .",
    "most of such models have been introduced in the graph - based or object - oriented frameworks , but usually their mathematical foundations do not allow a complete study of the expressive power of the query languages introduced .",
    "in fact , to our knowledge , the only exception is the graph - based model good @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a different syntactic characterization of queries computable in a data base .",
    "our characterization relies upon the notion of partitions of the domain , where each partition represents a level of _ undifferentiation _ among objects , values or vertices .",
    "notice that an automorphism also can represent a certain level of undifferentiation .",
    "initially we will exploit such notion to give two new characterizations of relations expressible in a relational data base .",
    "subsequently , we will show how to apply the new framework to analyze a simple graph - based model , hence proving that our characterization can be useful in comparing the expressive power of different data languages .    following the approach of  @xcite , the data models studied in this paper are domain - preserving , that is , it is not possible to create new vertices or values , but only to query an existing data base . in our framework ,",
    "a binary relation over sets of data values is defined , denoted by @xmath3 , which relates those sets of values that can not be differentiated . from the relation",
    "@xmath3 we build some sets of partitions that _ respect _",
    "@xmath3 , that is , all classes in a partition are preserved by @xmath3 .",
    "we prove that expressiveness of a query language can be stated as the conservation of some of those partitions , where the exact set of partitions that must be preserved depends on the data model .",
    "the expressibility results we obtain have the following form : _ given a data base @xmath1 , let @xmath4 be a relation or a graph over the domain set of @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath4 can be expressed in @xmath1 if and only if @xmath5 _ , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are two sets of partitions which depend on the model under consideration .",
    "all sets considered in this paper are assumed to be finite and nonempty .",
    "given a set @xmath8 , a _ relation _ @xmath0 over @xmath8 is a subset of the cartesian product @xmath9 ( @xmath10 times ) for some fixed integer @xmath11 , that is a set of tuples of length @xmath10 , where all components of a tuple are elements of @xmath8 .",
    "the number @xmath12 is called the _ order _ or _ arity _ of the relation . given a set @xmath13 of relations over @xmath8 , the pair @xmath14 is called a _",
    "relational database _ ; in this setting , @xmath8 is the _ domain _ of the database , and @xmath15 is the set of relations of the database .",
    "given a relation @xmath16 of a database @xmath14 , we denote with @xmath17 the _ data domain _ of @xmath0 , that is the subset of the elements of the database domain @xmath8 that are in at least one tuple of @xmath0 . the notion of data domain",
    "is easily extended to the set @xmath15 of relations as the set union of relations data domains : @xmath18 . without loss of generality",

    "this seemingly trivial requirement is indeed very important , as it will become evident after theorem  [ teo : paredaens2 ] , therefore we will omit the universe set unless it is necessary to avoid any ambiguities .",
    "just as in  @xcite , when referring to a relational database , we use the _ relational algebra _ as a query language . in relational algebra",

    "the _ projection _ of @xmath0 over @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 , is the relation : @xmath32 .",
    "now , let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be two integers such that @xmath35 , where @xmath26 is the arity of a relation @xmath0 .",
    "the _ equality restriction _ of @xmath0 on @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the relation , denoted by @xmath36 , that is obtained by taking from @xmath0 all the tuples for which the @xmath33-th and the @xmath34-th components are equal : @xmath37 .",
    "analogously , the _ inequality restriction _ of @xmath0 on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , denoted by @xmath38 , is the relation obtained by taking from @xmath0 all the tuples for which the @xmath33-th and the @xmath34-th components are different : @xmath39 .",
    "the five operations just described are sufficient to generate the operations of intersection , difference , join and division , usually assumed as primitives in codd s relational algebra ; a proof of this fact can be found , for example , in  @xcite .    given a relational data base @xmath40 , we will denote by @xmath41 the relation which is the result of applying the expression ( of the relational algebra ) e to the data base @xmath1 .",
    "moreover a relation @xmath4 over @xmath8 is told to be _ expressible _ from @xmath15 if there exists an expression @xmath42 whose operands are all relations in @xmath15 , and such that @xmath41 is equal to @xmath4 . following  @xcite ,",

    "we can also assume that the first tuple of @xmath61 represents the identity function on @xmath8 ( which is always present in @xmath52 , since it is compatible with every nonempty set of relations ) ; as a consequence , it can always be assumed that the first row of @xmath61 is the tuple @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a relational data base , with :    * @xmath65 * @xmath66 , with : @xmath67    it is easily verified that : @xmath68 @xmath69 if we look at the @xmath15-compatible automorphisms as permutations over @xmath8 , we can express @xmath52 as follows : @xmath70 [ ex : klein - group ]    it is not difficult to see that , for a given database @xmath14 , the set @xmath52 of @xmath15-compatible automorphisms is indeed a group with respect to function composition , with the identity function over @xmath8 as unitary element .",
    "in fact , the identity over @xmath8 is always in @xmath52 , the inverse of an @xmath15-compatible automorphism is still an @xmath15-compatible automorphism , and the composition between two @xmath15-compatible automorphisms is again an @xmath15-compatible automorphism . since we can always assume @xmath71",

    "in this paper we investigate the relation between expressive power and partitions of the database domain .",
    "more precisely , we investigate the possibility to characterize the expressive power of relational and graph - based databases via one or more theorems abiding to the following meta theorem .",

    "the relevance of the main result in  @xcite is that it is the first syntactic characterization of the relations that can be obtained from a given database @xmath14 when the relational algebra is used as a query language .",
    "more precisely , in  @xcite the following theorem is proved .",
    "let @xmath14 be a relational database , and let @xmath4 be a relation over @xmath8",
    ". then @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "[ teo : paredaens ]    basically , paredaens has been able to point out the fundamental relation between expressiveness in a database and the set of automorphisms in the relational model .",
    "such result has been successively extended in  @xcite to define in a formal way the notion of _ genericity _ , that is computable queries @xcite have to be invariant with respect to the isomorphisms between databases .",
    "we can restate theorem  [ teo : paredaens ] in a form that will be more convenient for our purposes .",
    "let @xmath14 be a relational database , and let @xmath4 be a relation over @xmath8",
    ". then @xmath80 .",
    "[ teo : paredaens2 ]    first of all , we show that @xmath81 . proving that @xmath82 is trivial as @xmath83 .",
    "the latter stems from the fact that the relations which are expressible from @xmath15 are those obtained from @xmath84 simply ignoring the relation @xmath4 .",
    "let now be @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "if the expression that gives @xmath87 from @xmath84 does contain some occurrence of the relation @xmath4 , it is sufficient to replace such occurrence with the expression that gives @xmath4 from @xmath15 to conclude that @xmath88 , and thus @xmath89 .",
    "it is immediate to notice that @xmath90 implies @xmath91 .    since we have established that @xmath81 , the two databases @xmath14 and @xmath92 are _ basic information equivalent _  that is , every relation of the first database can be obtained from the relations of the second database and vice versa  if and only if @xmath4 is expressible from @xmath14 .",
    "a direct consequence of theorem  [ teo : paredaens ] is that two databases @xmath93 and @xmath94 are basic information equivalent if and only if @xmath95 ( which are assumed to be both equal to @xmath8 ) and @xmath96 ; thus , we can conclude that @xmath80 as stated .",
    "we observe that , given our assumption that @xmath97 , in theorem [ teo : paredaens2 ] we can get rid of the inclusion between the domains , since it is implicit from the fact that @xmath4 is a relation over @xmath8 . on the other hand , we _ can not _ ignore the inclusion condition if we suppose that @xmath98 , since in such a situation it is not difficult to show two relations @xmath0 and @xmath4 such that @xmath99 but @xmath100 .",
    "a notion that seems tightly related to the expressiveness of relations in a database is that of _ indistinguishability _ between elements of the domain . intuitively , the idea is that the elements of a subset of the domain of a given database are indistinguishable if and only if no query to the database is able to divide the set in two parts , one made of the elements that occur in the relation resulting from the query and the other made of the elements that do not occur in the relation .",
    "in such a situation , we say that the set of indistinguishable elements can not be _ separated _ by any of the queries that can be presented to the database .",
