    "supernovae ( sne ) are dramatic and violent end - points of stellar evolution , and lie at the heart of some of the most important problems of modern astronomy since their huge luminosities were first estimated and a clear distinction between classical novae and sne was made @xcite .    * sne and stellar evolution * + sne provide natural laboratories for studying the physics of hydrodynamic , nuclear processes in extreme conditions and are involved in the formation of neutron stars , black holes , and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "furthermore , sne are sources of gravitational waves and of neutrino emission , and candidate sites for high - energy cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "thus , it is of broad astrophysical importance to understand the physical conditions for these spectacular explosions . + we recognize two physically defined classes : core collapse - induced explosion of short - lived massive stars ( cc sne ) and thermonuclear explosions of long - lived low mass stars ( sne ia ) . in recent years deeper and more frequent searches for transient events in the local and distant universe as well the identification of sn progenitor stars on pre - discovery images from hubble and spitzer space telescopes have provided us with important information on the evolution of massive stars and binary systems @xcite .",
    "_ however , a growing number of peculiar events suggests that the standard scenario of stellar evolution and explosion physics may not be complete and demands further physical understanding and theoretical explanation . _",
    "* sne and dark energy * + type ia sne are standard candles due to their significant intrinsic brightness and homogeneity .",
    "they have provided the first evidence for an accelerated expansion of the universe and remain one of the more promising probes of the nature and amount of dark energy , @xcite .",
    "cc sne display a huge range in their physical characteristics , including kinetic energy , radiated energy and the amount of radioactive elements created during the explosion . however , plateau cc sne ( sne iip ) that undergo a long phase of constant luminosity in their photometric evolution are potential standardizable candles , although they are not as luminous and uniform as sne ia @xcite . _",
    "understanding the mechanism that is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe is one of the crucial next steps for cosmology and requires both new searches for type ia and type iip sne to populate the hubble diagram and the knowledge of their progenitors and explosion mechanisms .",
    "_    * sne and galaxy evolution * + sne play also a major role in driving the chemical , kinetic , and dynamical evolution of galaxies .",
    "they are the main producers of heavy elements and are fundamental for understanding global abundances and abundance patterns in galaxy clusters and in the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "sne ia are important contributors of iron and release it to the interstellar medium over longer timescales , compared to the @xmath0 elements produced by cc sne .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 to iron abundance ratio can be used to evaluate the formation timescales of stellar systems .",
    "moreover the sn metal - rich ejecta are believed to be a potentially important site of cosmic dust formation .",
    "the energy release from sne can initiate episodes of star formation ( sf ) , impact the evolution of gas flow and contribute to the feedback processes in galaxies @xcite . _",
    "a complete and coherent picture of the formation and evolution of the galaxies is a fundamental objective of modern astronomy and sne are an important ingredient to model the chemical enrichment of the galaxies and the effect of energy / momentum feedback on galaxy formation .",
    "_    * sne and sfr * + the cosmic evolution of sn rates is an alternative and complementary probe of the sf history ( sfh ) in the galaxies . due to the short lifetime of progenitor",
    "stars the cc sn rate is directly proportional to the current sfr while type ia sn rate reflects the convolution of the sfh with the distribution of the delay times between progenitor star formation and explosion @xcite .",
    "poor statistics is a major limiting factor for using the cc sn rate as a tracer of the sfr . at low redshift",
    "the difficulty is in sampling large enough volumes of the local universe to ensure significant statistics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while at high redshift the difficulty lies in detecting and typing complete samples of intrinsically faint sne @xcite .",
    "moreover it is expected that a fraction of cc sne are missed by optical searches , since they are embedded in dusty spiral arms or galaxy nuclei .",
    "this fraction may change with redshift , if the amount of dust in galaxies evolves with time .",
    "_ progress in using cc sn rates as sfr tracers requires accurate measurements of rates at various cosmic epochs and in different environments .",
    "furthermore it requires a comparison with other sfr diagnostics in a wide range of redshift to investigate the causes of the observed discrepancy . _",
    "+ despite the importance of sne in several astronomical topic many fundamental questions remain with regard these exciting phenomena .",
    "stellar evolution theory predicts that all stars more massive than @xmath1 complete eso - energetic nuclear burnings and develop an iron core that can not be supported by any further nuclear fusion reaction , or by electron degenerate pressure .",
    "the collapse of the iron core results in the formation of a compact object , a neutron star or a black hole , accompanied by the high - velocity ejection of a large fraction of the progenitor mass . despite this basic understanding ,",
    "the picture of massive star death emerging from recent discovery is far to be clear .    *",
    "which massive star in which evolutionary stage produce which cc sn type ? * + different types of cc sne have been identified on the basis of their spectroscopic and photometric properties : type ii sne show presence of h in the spectra , ( type iip sne exhibit a long plateau in their light curve while type iil show a linear decline rate ) , type ib sne lack h but show he , type ic sne lack both h and he , type iin sne exhibit a narrow @xmath2 emission line and present other strong evidences of interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar material ( csm ) already at early phases of their evolution . this sequence has been explained on the basis of the progenitor mass loss history with the most massive stars loosing the largest fraction of their initial mass @xcite : type iip progenitor stars are red super giants ( rsgs ) that explode with most of their h envelope present , type iil progenitors had extensive mass loss but preserved a small h envelope , type ib / c progenitors are wolf - rayet stars that had lost their h and he envelopes , type iin progenitor have suffered a major mass loss episode just before the explosion . several cc sne with characteristics intermediate between these canonical types have been recently discovered suggesting a smooth transition and requiring the introduction of hybrid classes ( for example type iib sne and ibn sne ) .",
    "the progenitor stars of sne iip are the best constrained from direct detection since these sne are the most frequent in the nearby universe .",
    "their mass function seems to suggest a lack of high mass progenitors ( @xmath3 ) and raises the intriguing possibility that more massive stars collapse directly to a black - hole and produce either faint or failed sne @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of sne ib / c have so far eluded discovery and several observational evidences have suggested an alternative scenario where a significant fraction of their progenitors are stars of much lower initial mass in close binary systems stripped of their envelopes by the interaction with the companion @xcite .",
    "recent observations have suggested the possibility that stars explode as cc sne shortly after the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase characterized by sporadic variability and occasionally giant outbursts with a huge mass loss in a single short event @xcite .",
    "in particular some sne ( 2006jc , 2006gy , @xcite ) showed evidence that their progenitors had properties consistent with lbv and in one case a pre - explosion outburst was seen .     * which physical parameters drive the cc sn diversity ? * + the variety of the observational properties shown by cc sne and the relative numbers of different types reflects the large range of stellar types seen in the upper region of the hertzsprung russel diagram above @xmath4 and the different physical conditions ( radius , density profile and surrounding csm ) before the explosion @xcite .",
    "the simple scheme where only the mass loss drives the evolution of massive stars can not explain the surprising diversity in explosion energies and it is essential to investigate the effect of other key factors ( metallicity , rotation rate , magnetic fields , binary membership ) @xcite .",
    "a major puzzle is due to the discovery of a number of sne at the extrema of the luminosity function and requires further physical understanding .",
    "a subset of sub - luminous type ii sne shows both a very faint radioactive tail in the light curve and a low expansion velocity suggesting low energy explosions and a possible black hole remnant , giving rise to significant fallback @xcite",
    ".    different types of extremely luminous cc sne have been recently discovered in dwarf , faint host galaxies @xcite with an enormous luminosity at maximum that can not be powered by radioactive @xmath5ni .",
    "several scenarios have been proposed to explain these events : an explosion driven by black hole accretion @xcite , the spin down of a rapidly rotating young magnetar @xcite , interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense csm @xcite or pulsational pair instability in which collisions between high velocity shells are the source of multiple , bright optical transients @xcite .    *",
    "what are the alternative explosion mechanisms producing a cc sn ?",
    "*   + to explain the full range of explosion parameters of cc sne some theoretical studies suggested two alternative explosion mechanisms with respect to the collapse of the iron core : electron capture and pair instability .",
    "electron capture sne ( ec sne ) occur when a star in the mass range of @xmath6 forms an electron degenerate o - ne - mg core and the core may collapse before ne ignition @xcite .",
    "the lower and maximum initial mass for ec sne is determined by the competing effects of core growth and mass loss during the late evolutionary stages of super - agb stars and are quite uncertain ( @xmath7 , @xcite ) .",
    "the pair instability sne ( pi sne ) occur when the high temperatures in a massive core ( he core @xmath8 and initial mass @xmath9 ) induces electron - positron pair production reducing the radiation pressure and hence leading to a rapid contraction followed by a thermonuclear explosion .",
    "a similar mechanism is pulsational pair instability in which a massive core undergoes interior instability again due to electron - positron pair production ejecting many solar masses in a series of giant pulses @xcite . at the moment",
    "there are few observational probes of pi sne .    *",
    "which type of massive stars produce black holes ? *   + the origin of stellar mass black holes is not yet understood : some stars ( @xmath10 ) are expected to produce weak explosions with a black hole formed by fallback , some others ( @xmath11 ) collapse into a black hole directly without any optical signature ( failed sne ) .",
    "the failed sne have been invoked by theorists because of the difficulties of producing an explosion in analytical models but there are remarkably few observational probes of them , e.g. the lack of high mass progenitors may suggest there is a population of black - hole forming sne which so far have eluded discovery .",
    "the detection of sudden neutrino bursts with given duration and energy ( to discriminate other events , such as ordinary sne , neutron stars formations and so on ) , may be pontentially the signature of failed sne @xcite .",
    "also gamma - ray astronomy @xcite and gravitational - wave astronomy may be sensitive probes of failed sne @xcite .    * what is the nature of sn impostors ?",
    "* + the luminosity gap separating novae and sub - luminous sne is recently being populated by a number of low energy events that have been classified as sne ( sn impostors ) and show a significant diversity ranging from giant eruptions of lbvs to very faint transients of unknown physical origin @xcite .",
    "the overlapping of bolometric luminosity and kinetic energies between sn impostors and faint cc sne requires to investigate in more detail the observational differences between explosive and eruptive transients . at the moment",
    "the only certain test to distinguish stellar eruptions from genuine cc sn explosions is to observe the outcome of the transient event : the surviving progenitor star in the case of eruptive event or a compact sn remnant in the case of cc sn explosion @xcite .",
    "we also need to understand the diversity of these transients that may reflect different eruption or explosion mechanisms ( luminous red novae , stellar mergers in low mass systems , erupting oh / ir stars , weak ec sne from super - agb stars ) @xcite .     * what distinguishes a grb progenitor from that of hypernovae ?",
    "* + the energetically most extreme sne ib / ic ( hypernovae ) have been associated to long grbs @xcite .",
    "grb - sne are strongly aspherical explosions characterized by a very luminous maximum light , a huge expansion velocity and a very high kinetic energy ( about 10 larger than observed in standard cc sne ) @xcite .",
    "their progenitors are massive stars ( @xmath12 ) in low metallicity star forming environments @xcite with high rotation rate @xcite that lost all h envelope .",
    "to date only six clear cases of hypernovae have been discovered plus another three cases which show possible sn signatures in the spectra of the grb afterglows .",
    "the existence of sne ic / ib without observed grbs , as well as that of grbs without sn signatures , raises the question of what distinguishes a long grb progenitor from that of a hypernova and an ordinary sn ic / ib @xcite .",
    "there is general consensus that sne ia are thermonuclear explosions of a carbon and oxygen white dwarf ( co wd ) near the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath13 ) in a binary system .",
    "the use of sne ia as standard candles is based on the assumption that all sne ia have similar progenitors and are highly homogeneous but the nature of the companion star and the details of the explosion mechanism are still debated .    * what is the progenitor star and explosion mechanism of sne ia ? * + the most widely favoured progenitor scenarios for sne ia are the single degenerate scenario ( sd ) in which a wd , accreting from a non degenerate companion ( a main sequence star , a subgiant , a red giant or a helium star ) , grows in mass until it reaches the chandrasekhar mass and explodes in a thermonuclear runaway , or double degenerate scenario ( dd ) , in which a close double wd system merges after orbital shrinking due to the emission of gravitational waves @xcite.the time elapsed from the birth of the binary system to the sn explosion ( delay - time ) spans from tens of million years to ten billion years @xcite",
    ". a thermonuclear explosion may occur before the wd reaches the chandrasekhar mass ( sub - chandrasekhar models ) ( * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) or when the wd exceed the chandrasekhar mass ( super - chandrasekhar models ) in both sd and dd scenario @xcite .",
    "the observed features of standard sne ia are better explained by the chandrasekhar mass although no conclusive evidence for a specific scenario has so far been found .",
    "the recent discovery of variable circumstellar absorption lines in the snia 2006x @xcite and the first direct detection of the precursor of a sn ia ( an x - ray source at the position of sn 2007on , @xcite ) seem to support the sd scenario .",
    "however @xcite did not detect any x - ray source in images taken six weeks after sn 2007on optical maximum and found an offset between the sn and the measured x - ray source position of @xmath14 \" .",
    "only future observations can shed light on the proposed connection between the x - ray source and the progenitor of sn 2007on , and thus on the most plausible scenario for this sn ia progenitor .",
    "the analysis of the recent sn 2011fe in m101 seems to rule out the presence of a red giant and helium - star donors in pre - explosion images @xcite , of a circumstellar wind from a giant donor @xcite and of shocks from ejecta hitting a companion , by analysing very early optical and uv data @xcite .",
    "the explosion mechanism of standard sne ia is also largely unknown ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "key issues include the initiation of the thermonuclear runaway , its initial ignition point and subsequent evolution . in the chandrasekhar mass scenario ,",
    "a wd is thought to ignite near the center . at first",
    "the flame propagates subsonically as a deflagration and in a second phase a detonation triggers that propagates supersonically . the mechanism that leads to the formation of the detonation is still an open question : detonation transition by turbulence ( e.g. @xcite ) gravitationally confined detonation ( e.g. @xcite ) and pulsating reverse detonation @xcite .",
    "* why does their brightness correlate with light curve shape , color , stellar population age , metallicity ? * + thanks to the uniformity of their peak luminosities sne ia can be used as cosmological standard candles . a phenomenological correlation between their absolute magnitude and the shape of their light curves ( with brighter objects having a slower rate of decline )",
    "has been provided to calibrate their distances @xcite .",
    "only recently models were able to reproduce this calibration in terms of the underlying physics @xcite .",
    "however , this one - parameter description does not completely account for the variety of sne ia .",
    "the relation between color and light curve shape ( brighter sne ia are both bluer and have wider light curves than their fainter counterparts ) has been exploited to provide a more accurate luminosity calibration .",
    "however , the intrinsic color variations of sne ia have not yet been fully understood .",
    "several suggestions have been made for additional parameters : metallicity @xcite , high - velocity spectral features , spectral flux ratios @xcite , and the mass and/or the morphological type of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "an interesting possibility for the origin of the diverse properties of sne ia was recently suggested by @xcite theoretically and by @xcite observationally , namely an asymmetry in the sn explosion combined with the observer viewing angle .    * what is the origin of sn ia diversity ? *",
    "+ the standard sne ia used as cosmological distance indicators make up about 70% of the observed sne ia @xcite . with the advent of the new wide - area transient surveys , spectroscopic and photometric peculiarities have been noted in sne ia with increasing frequency and new subclasses of sne ia @xcite have been introduced : sub - luminous ( e.g. sn 1991bg ) , normal , bright ( e.g. sn 1991 t ) and super - luminous events ( e.g. sn 2007if ) . whether they form distinct physical groups from normal sne ia , with different progenitors and explosion models , or whether they lie at the extreme end of a continuous distribution is unclear .",
    "recent observations of sub - luminous and super - luminous sne ia suggest that their wd progenitors might have sub - chandrasekhar and super - chandrasekhar mass , respectively @xcite .",
    "various scenarios , for example a standard explosion with strong deviations from spherical symmetry of a chandrasekhar mass wd @xcite , or alternative energy sources other than radioactivity have been proposed to explain the super - luminous sne .",
    "it is also established that sub - luminous sne ia preferably occur in non - star - forming host galaxies with large stellar masses , such as ellipticals @xcite while super - luminous sne ia occur in relatively metal poor host galaxies @xcite understanding super - luminous and sub - luminous sne ia has important implications for cosmology and may challenge the paradigm of sn ia progenitors .",
    "modern sn searches are revealing ever more extreme examples of faint sne ia with lower kinetic energies , the nature of which is controversial with possible models ranging from the direct collapse of a massive star to a black hole to the pure deflagration of a wd ( e.g. , @xcite )    * are there two different progenitor channels ? * + a distinct population of sn ia progenitors ( called prompt ) with short delay time ( few hundred million years ) has been proposed to explain the high sn ia rate in blue star - forming galaxies and in radio - loud galaxies @xcite .",
    "tardy sne ia arise in old population of at least several gyr in red , passively evolving ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the prompt sne ia seem to have broader light curves , to be on average brighter and to show fewer intermediate - mass elements than their tardy counterparts .",
    "the ratio of prompt to tardy events is expected to change with redshift , tracking increasing sfr , with a resulting evolution in average light curve width , sn ia brightness , and spectral feature strength .",
    "the current measurements of type ia sn rates can not constrain the progenitor models for the uncertainties in the sf history and in sn rate measurements .",
    "progress in investigating the nature of type ia sn progenitors requires to link sn rates and parent stellar populations with measurements in star forming and in passively evolving galaxies over a wide range of redshifts from @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "this was the first survey at redshifts suitable for starting cosmological studies ( @xmath18 ) .          in the last two decades of the @xmath19 century the advent of ccds revolutionized astronomy and visual or photographic observations were substituted by digital images .",
    "mechanical blinking machines and visual inspections were replaced by computer analysis.the improved ccd and computer technology , the increasing size of telescopes , the advent of larger detectors or ccd mosaics , the development of automated / robotic telescopes and more sophisticated image analysis software boosted the productivity of sn surveys of the 90s .",

    "however , if the volume of the search , which is defined by the survey area times its depth , is large enough we can rely on the universe homogeneity on large scale and adopt volumetric rates . for the current simulation",
    "we assume that this is the case for the gaia survey that , although not very deep , is all sky .",
    "we derived the transit distributions for the different sky pixels from the gaia sky coverage map adopting a pixel resolution of 0.84 square degrees .",
    "as a further simplification we assumed that the transits occurring within 6 hours from the first observation ( i.e. after a full satellite rotation ) see the same sky while more distant transits are evenly distributed within the 5 years of the mission . for our aim to estimate the total number of sne detected by gaia and",
    "given the timescale of sn evolution this is quite a good approximation .",
    "we expect that gaia will detect about 6300 sne , most of them ia ( 85% ) and the remaining cc sne . of the sne",
    "ia detected about 30% will be discovered before maximum light .",
    "sne ia will be discovered up to redshift @xmath45 with a peak around @xmath46 .",
    "instead almost all cc sne will be at redshifts @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snzdistribution ] ) . based on tests with different assumptions ,",
    "the uncertainty of the simulation is @xmath3910 - 15% .",
    "our results agree very well with the recent estimates by s. hodgkin ( private communication ) .",
    "+ even if the expected number of sne detected by gaia decreased in the most recent estimates ( see @xcite , this work ) , it still represents a significant contribution to the current discovery rate ( fig.[fig : sndiscoveryrate1 ] ) .",
    "the gaia science alerts stream , with almost real time transient events , will be the first gaia data released to the astronomical community . it should be noted that transients will not be proprietary , as is often the case nowadays in many wide - field surveys undertaken by `` private '' projects .",
    "all transients data will be distributed immediately after the detection in accordance with the esa agreement .",
    "this will allow the scientific community to investigate interesting targets immediately .",
    "gaia is expected to disseminate several sn alerts per day along the five years mission , however many of these sn candidates will be either already discovered by other sn survey or very late due to the satellite time sampling . only the regions with frequently repeated visits will produce sn candidates which are very young , hence potentially most interesting . in all large surveys",
    "the rejection of false positive , the confirmation of the sn candidates and their prompt follow - up represent a challenging issue . the gaia time sampling will provide a photometric confirmation and a partial follow up , since for each observed object will be available a color and a low resolution spectrum provided by the two low dispersion slitless prism spectrographs , the blue photometer ( bp ) and the red photometer ( rp ) , that cover the 3300 - 6800 and 6400 - 10500 ranges respectively , with a spectral resolution varying from 20 to 100 approximately . in principle , these data can be very valuable to obtain a prompt transient classification as sn and possibly the sn type .",
    "each object brighter than magnitude 17 will be also observed through the radial velocity spectrometer ( rvs ) , providing an high resolution ( @xmath48 ) spectrum in a narrow region ( 8470 - 8740 ) around the calcium triplet .",
    "unfortunately most of the expected sne will be fainter than magnitude 17 .",
    "+ due to the irregular time sampling and to the instrumental setup that is not optimal for sn follow - up , ground based observations are highly desirable . a prompt follow up is also desirable for studying early phases properly .",
    "the astronomical community , including the italian one , is trying to set up a network to secure a prompt reaction to the announcement of the transients detected by the satellite ( @xcite ) and an intensive follow - up of the most interesting transients .",
    "the most distant sne ia accessible to gaia are at @xmath49 , hence @xmath50  m class telescope , or even smaller for brighter objects , located in both the hemispheres , will be suitable .",
    "follow - ups may be limited to the most intensively regions monitored by gaia to achieve the maximum efficiency .",
    "+ some of us are involved in the public eso spectroscopic survey for transient objects ( pessto ) at ntt and in the gaia - eso survey ( ges ) at vlt .",
    "the goal of pessto is to exploit the large allocations of telescope time available through an eso public survey to assemble data on all forms of sne covering the full range of parameter space that the current surveys now deliver ( luminosity , host metallicity , explosion mechanisms ) .",
    "the survey is expected to deliver time series spectra of 150 transients and optical and nir light curves for tha majority of these transients . in order to select the targets ,",
    "@xmath51 sne are expected to be classified , and all information on these will be publicly available , providing an alert list available to the global community .",
    "pessto will start on april 2012 and 90 nights per year over 4 years ( with a possible 1 year extension ) have already been granted .",
    "the public spectroscopic survey ges started on dec .",
    "31 , 2011 and a total of 240 nights over 4 years ( with a possible 1 year extension ) have already been awarded to the project .",
    "the main goal of the ges is to study the formation and evolution of the milky way and its stellar populations .",
    "the observation of @xmath52 stars , systematically covering all major components of the milky - way will provide valuable complementary data to gaia and vice versa .",
    "the unified study of sn progenitor stars and sn explosion characteristics as well as the analysis of the sn rate evolution with redshift are promising to solve important issues about these intriguing events and to exploit sne as cosmological standard candles and as a probe of the sfr .",
    "searches for transients to increase the sample of both standard and peculiar sne are required .",
    "while transients are not the founding scientific rationale of gaia , it has become clear that the mission will be a competitive , all sky transient survey without any input object bias and will collect a huge data - set of local sne , with a significant fraction of under - luminous and over - luminous events .",
    "a community of interested scientists is being formed and is in contact to discuss the science opportunities with this mission .",
    "+ the big and homogeneous samples provided by gaia , coupled with a homogeneous data treatment , will allow robust statistical studies .",
    "relatively rare / peculiar sne or new transients will be studied in a statistically significant way , subclassifying them into much finer grids if necessary .",
    "these large statistical studies will significantly improve our understanding of the sn explosions and they will substantially reduce systematic errors in distance estimates , providing tighter constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "+ the extremely accurate positions provided by gaia will allow a detailed study of the sn spatial distribution in different galaxy types and environments",
    ". the precise spatial location together with additional data from ground - based observations may provide evidence for possible progenitors and correlations between sne properties , location / environment and host type .",
    "distances and redshifts will also be useful to probe the local velocity field ."
