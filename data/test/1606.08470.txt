    "<S> we theoretically investigate the supercurrent - induced magnetization dynamics of a two - dimensional lattice of ferromagnetically ordered spins placed on a conventional superconductor with broken spatial inversion symmetry and strong spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a phenomenological description of the coupled dynamics of the superconducting condensate and the spin system , and demonstrate that supercurrents produce a reactive spin - orbit torque on the magnetization . by performing a microscopic self - consistent calculation , we show that the spin - orbit torque originates from a spin - polarization of the cooper pairs due to current - induced spin - triplet correlations . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that there exists an intrinsic limitation for the maximum achievable spin - orbit torque , which is determined by the coupling strength between the condensate and the spin system . in proximitized hole - doped semiconductors , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum achievable spin - orbit torque field is estimated to be on the order of @xmath0 mt , which is comparable to the critical field for current - induced magnetization switching in ferromagnetic semiconductors . </S>"
