    "detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries provide a largely model - independent means to precisely and accurately measure fundamental stellar properties , particularly masses and radii . in the best - observed systems",
    "the precision of these can be at the @xmath7 per cent level , and thus place stringent constraints on stellar evolution models ( e.g. @xcite ) .    despite this , as far as we are aware , there are at present only four known systems with one or more components between @xmath8 and the hydrogen burning limit on the main sequence ( i.e. old , field stars ) : cm  dra @xcite , cu  cnc  b @xcite , lp  133 - 373 @xcite , and sdss  j031824 - 010018 @xcite .",
    "although jw  380 @xcite , nsvs  02502726b @xcite , and the ngc  1647 system of @xcite also satisfy this mass criterion , these objects are still contracting on the pre  main - sequence .",
    "of the known systems , the only two with parameters determined to better than @xmath9 per cent are cm  dra and cu  cnc . for sdss",
    "j031824 - 010018 , the knowledge of the parameters is limited largely by radial velocity errors , since this system is extremely faint ( sdss @xmath10 ) and has an extremely short orbital period ( @xmath11 ) , meaning long integrations can not be used to obtain better signal - to - noise .",
    "hence there is little possibility for substantial improvement in the parameters in the near future .",
    "it is clear that , in order to better - constrain the stellar mass - radius relation on the main sequence , more bright , low - mass eclipsing binaries are needed to yield extremely precise masses and radii .",
    "furthermore , observations of these systems have indicated significant discrepancies with the stellar models .",
    "this is particularly the case below @xmath12 , and the components of cm  dra ( the lowest - mass system with @xmath13 observational errors ) have radii @xmath14 per cent larger than the theoretical predictions from state - of - the - art stellar evolution models .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. @xcite ) that the reason for this discrepancy may be that close binaries are not actually representative of single - stars at this level of precision .",
    "the effect of the close companion and tidal locking is likely to significantly increase activity levels in close binaries , and these authors suggest that it could be this effect that is responsible for the inflated radii of cm  dra .",
    "@xcite examined the available sample of single - star and eclipsing binary measurements to search for correlations of radius with activity levels and metallicity , finding that such a correlation of activity with radius does appear to exist for members of close binary stars .",
    "this result was based on a small number of measurements for late m - dwarfs , and the conclusions would be strengthened by the availability of additional precise estimates of the parameters for binaries with a range of activity levels and orbital periods , to explore the available parameter space .",
    "we present the discovery of a new bright , low - mass eclipsing binary system , gj 3236 .",
    "the components show high activity levels , as evidenced by h@xmath6 emission lines in the spectra of both stars , and show rotational modulations in the light curves that are synchronized with the binary orbital period of @xmath15 .",
    "this system thus has the potential to yield an additional precise test of stellar evolution models for high activity and short orbital periods .",
    "eclipses in gj 3236 were detected during 2008 january in the first two weeks of routine operations of the newly - commissioned mearth observatory , a system designed primarily to search for transiting super - earth exoplanets orbiting around the nearest @xmath16 mid to late m - dwarfs in the northern hemisphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "exposure times on each field observed by mearth are tailored to achieve sensitivity to a particular planet size for the assumed stellar parameters of the target star , and were @xmath17 for gj 3236 .",
    "after the initial detection of the eclipses , we switched to a follow - up mode , observing at the highest possible cadence ( i.e. continuously , resulting in a cadence of approximately @xmath18 including overheads ) during eclipse and for an additional @xmath19 window surrounding the eclipse , and at the normal cadence for the mearth survey of approximately @xmath20 for the remainder of the time . in this way",
    ", we sample as well as possible the rapid flux decrement during eclipse , and the out of eclipse portions of the light curve .",
    "we note that sampling the latter is of crucial importance for obtaining accurate parameters from light curve analyses of binary systems showing out of eclipse modulations , such as the present one .",
    "we obtained data both in the initial season after the eclipses were first detected ( 2008 january to may , inclusive ) , and following the summer monsoon ( 2008 october onwards ) . during this time , there were a number of software improvements ( including the ability to update the telescope pointing after taking each science image , resulting in substantially improved light curves due to minimizing the drift across the detector , and hence the effect of flat fielding errors , fringing , etc . ) and our filter system was changed from cousins @xmath21 to a custom long - pass filter with transmission from @xmath22 , and limited at the long wavelength end by the tail of the ccd quantum efficiency curve ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we have elected to use only the latter data - set for modeling , despite this having the disadvantage of being observed in a non - standard bandpass , because it is approximately contemporaneous with our @xmath23-band follow - up photometry .",
    "we see evidence for evolution of the amplitude and phase of the out of eclipse modulation between the two observing seasons , so this simplifies the analysis by allowing the use of a single set of spot parameters to describe both bandpasses .",
    "a total of @xmath24 observations were obtained between ut 2008 october 2 and ut 2008 december 11 , including 6 primary and 3 secondary eclipses sampled at high cadence .",
    "data were reduced using the standard mearth reduction pipeline , which is at present identical to the monitor project pipeline described in @xcite .",
    "we used a smaller aperture radius of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) than the usual value of @xmath27 adopted for bright stars , due to the presence of a nearby star approximately @xmath28 from gj  3236 at the epoch of our observations , and @xmath29 fainter in the mearth bandpass . this star does not share a common proper motion with gj  3236 and is therefore not physically associated . reducing the aperture size in this way",
    "reduces the flux contributed by this star in the light curve of gj  3236 to a negligible level ( we estimate a @xmath30 error in the measured fluxes , and thus also in the eclipse depths ) .",
    "the high proper motion of the gj  3236 system allows us to constrain the contribution of any additional background stars in the photometric aperture that are not co - moving with gj  3236 itself , using previous epochs of imaging .",
    "we show in figure [ third_light_images ] a series of three images centered on the position of the photometric aperture used for gj  3236 in the mearth images , demonstrating that there are no such objects . if any additional third light is indeed present , it must therefore be co - moving with gj  3236 , meaning it is highly likely to be physically associated , given the extremely small probability of such a chance alignment .",

    "we then divided by a normalized flat field exposure to correct for fringing in the red - most regions of the spectrum , which has a significant effect on the orders we used for the radial velocity analysis .    at the time of our observations , the tres detector suffered from a very high energetic particle hit rate ,",

    "for detached eclipsing binaries with circular orbits , the radial velocity ( rv ) and light curve models are largely independent .",
    "we therefore carried out a preliminary analysis of the available light curves before starting to obtain spectroscopic observations .",
    "the principal purpose of doing this was to determine an extremely precise orbital period to better - target the radial velocity observations , but we can also constrain the system eccentricity by using the phase of the secondary eclipses relative to the primary eclipses ( related to @xmath362 ) .",
    "a simple geometric argument can then be used to obtain a limit on the eccentricity itself , assuming no _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath363 .",

    "we therefore conservatively adopt the results from the absorption line analysis despite the larger errors .    the absorption line analysis used as a template spectrum a single epoch observation of barnard s star ( @xcite ; also known as gj  699 ) taken on ut 2008 october 20 .",
    "we used a wavelength range of 8700 to 8850  in order 50 of the spectrum to derive the velocities , since this region contains a number of reasonably strong metallic lines in m - dwarfs , and is free of telluric absorption lines .",

    "we used linear limb darkening coefficients @xmath466 and @xmath467 from @xcite for the sdss @xmath468 passband ( a close match to the effective wavelength of the spectroscopy ) , which correspond to our assumed temperatures for the primary and secondary ( see  [ ebop_lc_sect ] ) .",

    "the configuration of these spots affects the measured eclipse depths , depending on whether a spotted or unspotted part of the photosphere is eclipsed .",
    "this predominantly affects the derived ratio of surface brightnesses as measured by the ratio of depths of the primary and secondary eclipses ( and thus the ratios of the component radii and effective temperatures inferred from this ) , and a combination of @xmath510 and the orbital inclination inferred from the total eclipse depth .",
    "since our @xmath23-band data do not cover the portions of the light curve out of eclipse , and the scatter in the @xmath120-band data is too large to usefully constrain the model , the spot modeling must be done using single - band light curve information .",

    ", we can place each spot on either star .",
    "although the data do rule out some of the possible spot locations , there are still a range of possibilities , which introduces a systematic error into the geometric parameters of the system . in principle , measuring the color - dependence of the out - of - eclipse modulation would allow this degeneracy to be reduced .",
    "given the presently available data , we instead probe this systematic error by considering three characteristic spot configurations that are consistent with the light curve .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) one close to polar spot on each star , with @xmath515 , with both spots located in the same hemisphere as the chord traversed during the eclipse , resulting in the spot on the primary being eclipsed by the secondary during primary eclipse , and vice versa during secondary eclipse ; ( 2 ) likewise , only with the spots located in the opposite hemisphere , resulting in no spots being eclipsed ; and ( 3 ) a case intermediate between these , with a `` symmetric '' spot configuration of two spots on each star , at latitudes of @xmath502 with one located in each hemisphere . in each model , the spot latitudes and temperature ratios were held fixed , allowing only longitude and radius to vary , and in configuration ( 3 ) we enforced symmetry of the spot pattern about the equator , i.e. both spots on one star were forced to have the same longitudes and radii .",
    "this means that all three models have the same number of parameters ( @xmath516 ) .      to derive robust error estimates ,",
    "including the correlations between parameters , we have implemented a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm around the wd light curve model .",

    "compared to the well - known systems cm  dra and cu  cnc , gj  3236 has a shorter orbital period , and the h@xmath6 emission in the spectroscopy and out - of - eclipse modulations we observe in the light curve are indicative of high activity levels , with both the photometric period and the spectroscopic line broadening apparently consistent with the stellar spin being synchronized to the binary orbit , as expected from tidal theory ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite propose two hypotheses to explain the observed radius discrepancies between theoretical models and eclipsing binaries : ( 1 ) that the inflated radii result from reduced convective efficiency due to high rotation rates and large magnetic fields ; or ( 2 ) that magnetic spot coverage of the surfaces leads to reduced heat flux , and thus larger radii and cooler effective temperatures .",
    "hypothesis ( 2 ) has been found to be consistent with some of the well - known eclipsing binary systems , e.g. yy  gem @xcite , where the radius discrepancy ( and the discrepancy in effective temperature ) can be explained by the presence of starspots covering approximately @xmath673 of the stellar surface ( if the spots are cooler than the photosphere by @xmath674 ; @xcite ) .",
    "gj  3236 shows out of eclipse modulations of comparable amplitude to yy  gem , a compatible radius discrepancy within the present observational errors , and similarly has effective temperatures somewhat cooler than the models predict , so this is an attractive hypothesis . by obtaining precise , multi - band photometry covering the entire orbital phase",
    ", it may be possible to constrain the spot temperatures , and hence observationally test this argument .",
    "the main limitations in the orbital and geometric modeling of the system arise from the lack of out - of - eclipse data in multiple passbands , which leads to large errors ( @xmath675 ) on the radii when we take the degeneracies in the spot configuration into account .",
    "the precision of the mass estimates ( @xmath4 ) is limited by the error in the radial velocity measurements , and an important contribution to the uncertainties in the radii will be from the spectroscopic light ratio if the uncertainty in spot parameters can be resolved .",
    "further high - precision photometric measurements and high - resolution spectroscopy are therefore needed , and combined with careful analysis these should allow the precision of the mass and radius measurements for this system to be improved , potentially to beyond the @xmath124 level as for the well - known systems cm  dra and yy  gem .    the mearth team gratefully acknowledges funding from the david and lucile packard fellowship for science and engineering ( awarded to dc ) .",
