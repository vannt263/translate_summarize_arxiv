    "simultaneous planning localization and mapping ( splam ) or active slam has been a popular area of research over the years @xcite .",
    "the main theme is to compute a set of control actions for the mobile robot such that either the uncertainty of the robot or the combined uncertainty of robot and map states are bounded .",
    "traditionally , splam frameworks have been approached through either model predictive control @xcite or information gain @xcite paradigms . in recent times , belief space planning paradigms have tended to compute the control law in continuous domain @xcite taking a leaf out of slam frameworks that model it as a least squares problem @xcite .    however , all of the above works assume the availability of immediate range data and uncertainty estimates for the map .",
    "some of them , such as @xcite , also assume the availability of dense range data transposed to an occupancy grid map .",
    "in contrast , in a monocular slam setting , the following complexities get accrued :    * sparse depth estimates , which are highly inaccurate in textureless or low texture scenes * degeneracies in camera motion estimation such as in planar scenes or for in - place rotation of the camera * highly non linear nature of the camera projection operation since a monocular camera is not a depth sensor but a projective sensor    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we proposed a reinforcement learning based slam - safe navigational planner that learns to identify robot motions that can lead to failures in slam pose estimation and avoid such motions during trajectory planning .",
    "the method was expected to generate trajectories that have minimal failures and pose estimation errors over varying maps . through various experiments",
    "we have proven the effectiveness of a slam - safe planner that predicts failures and executes recovery actions to continue the navigation task . in terms of learning slam - safe behaviour ,",
    "our method showed an increase in performance by about 50% as compared to supervised learning methods . in terms of slam recovery during trajectory planning ,",
    "our methods showed about 70% improvement in comparison with a state - of - the - art trajectory planner and about 45% in comparison with supervised learning based planners .",
    "autonomous navigation with a monocular camera has always been challenging due to reasons mentioned earlier .",
    "this paper establishes that a rl framework is able to learn precisely those actions resorted by humans when they use a handheld camera or teleoperate a robot for slam . for example",
    "this involves slow transitions to newer scenes avoiding sharp turns by repeated back and forth motions , which was well captured by the learning framework .",

    "<S> effective slam using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its simplicity . however , when compared to trajectory planning methods using depth - based slam , monocular slam in loop does need additional considerations . </S>",
    "<S> one main reason being that for the optimization , in the form of bundle adjustment ( ba ) , to be robust , the slam system needs to scan the area for a reasonable duration . </S>",
    "<S> most monocular slam systems do not tolerate large camera rotations between successive views and tend to breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> other reasons for monocular slam failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the essential matrix , feature - sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart from ba . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a novel formulation based on reinforcement learning ( rl ) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the slam generated outputs ( scene structure and camera motion ) do not deviate largely from their true values . </S>",
    "<S> quintessentially , the rl framework successfully learns the otherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that result in trajectories that do not cause failure of slam , which are almost intractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation . </S>",
    "<S> we show systematically in simulations how the quality of the slam map and trajectory dramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using rl . </S>"
