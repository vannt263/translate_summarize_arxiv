    "the study of phase transitions under the view of exclusively quantum correlations has hooked the interest of the quantum information community recently @xcite .",
    "linking entanglement and ( quantum ) phase transitions ( pts ) is tempting since pts are related to correlations of long range among the system s constituents @xcite . thus expecting that entanglement presents a peculiar behavior near criticality is natural .",
    "recent results have shown a narrow connection between entanglement and critical phenomena .",
    "for instance , bipartite entanglement has been widely investigated near to singular points for exhibit interesting patterns @xcite .",
    "localizable entanglement _",
    "@xcite has been used to show certain critical points that are not detected by classical correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the _ negativity _ and the _ concurrence _ quantifiers were shown to be quantum - phase - transitions witnesses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , closely relations exist between entanglement and the order parameters associated to the transitions between a normal conductor and a superconductor and between a mott - insulator and a superfluid @xcite .",
    "the main route that has been taken in order to capture these ideas is through the study of entanglement in specific systems .",
    "however it is believed that a more general picture can be found . here",
    ", we go further in this direction starting from the generic result that , for a bipartite system at thermal equilibrium with a reservoir , there exist two distinct phases , one in which some entanglement is present and another one where quantum correlations completely vanish .",
    "we then exemplify this result with 2-qubit systems subjected to different hamiltonians and curiously it is viewed that , by choosing different entanglement quantifiers , one attributes different orders to the phase transition .",
    "although multipartite entanglement also plays an important role in many - body phenomena ( its is behind some interesting effects such as the _ meissner effect _",
    "@xcite , the _ high - temperature superconductivity _ @xcite , and _ superadiance _",
    "@xcite ) , rare results linking it to pts exist . crossing this barrier is also a goal of this letter .",
    "for that , we give necessary and sufficient conditions to a large class of multipartite entanglement quantifiers to signal singularities in the ground state energy of the system .",
    "we finish this work discussing a recently introduced quantum phase transition , the _ geometric phase transition _ , which takes place when a singularity in the boundary of the set of entangled states exists .",
    "a phase transition occurs when some state function of a system presents two distinct phases , one with a non - null value and another one in which this function takes the null value @xcite .",
    "such a function is called an _ order parameter _ for the system .",
    "however one can think that this is a very tight definition and want to define a pt as a singularity in some state function of the system due to changes in some parameter ( coupling factors in the hamiltonian , temperature , etc ) . by extension , this function",
    "is also called the order parameter of the pt .",
    "note that the first definition of pt is a special case of the latest one .",
    "when the singularity expresses itself as a discontinuity in the order parameter we say that we are dealing with a discontinuous pt .",
    "if the discontinuity happens in some of the derivatives of the order parameter , say the @xmath0-derivative , it is said to be a @xmath0-order pt , or a continuous pt . in this paper",
    "we will consider entanglement as a state function and see that it can present a singularity when some parameter of the problem changes .",
    "thus , we make a more general discussion about when a given entanglement quantifier , or some of its derivatives , can present a discontinuity .",
    "the first phase transition we will discuss is when a system is in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir .",
    "this system can show two phases : one separable and other entangled .",
    "the following question raises : is this transition smooth ?",
    "we will show that the answer for this question depends on the entanglement quantifier adopted .",
    "let us first revisit a very general result following just from a topological argument . given a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath2 , its thermal equilibrium state is given by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the partition function and @xmath5 , @xmath6 denoting the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 the absolute temperature .",
    "this state is a continuous function of its parameters .",
    "if the space state of the system has finite dimension @xmath8 , then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the identity operator . for multipartite systems , @xmath11 is an interior point in the set of separable states @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is separable and any small perturbation of it is still separable .",
    "the thermal equilibrium states @xmath12 can be viewed as a continuous path on the density matrix operators set , ending at @xmath11 .",
    "so if for some temperature @xmath13 the state @xmath14 is non - separable , there is a finite critical temperature @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is in the boundary of the set of separable states",
    ". an important class of examples is given by the systems with entangled ground state , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that the entanglement @xmath18 of the system will present a singularity at @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath18 can be viewed as a true order parameter in the commented pt .",
    "moreover let us explore a little bit more the result that `` thermal - equilibrium entanglement vanishes at finite temperature''@xcite .",
    "it will be shown that different entanglement quantifiers attribute different orders for this pt .",
    "for that we will show an entanglement quantifier that is discontinuous at @xmath19 , two others presenting a discontinuity at its first derivative ( asserting a @xmath20-order pt ) , and another one in which the discontinuity manifests itself in @xmath21 ( asserting a @xmath22-order pt ) .    as the first example take the indicator measure , @xmath23 , defined as 1 for entangled states and 0 for separable ones .",
    "although @xmath24 is an entanglement monotone @xcite . this feature has been viewed by many people as the unique requirement for a good quantifier of entanglement . ]",
    "it is quite weird once it is a discontinuous function itself .",
    "of course @xmath24 presents a discontinuity at @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath26 crosses the border between the entangled and the disentangled - states world .    however it is interesting to study some best behavioured and well - accepted entanglement monotones , and we will do that through some examples in the 2-qubit context .",
    "take the concurrence @xmath27 , the entanglement of formation @xmath28 and the negativity @xmath29 .",
    "these three functions are able to quantify entanglement properly although , as it will be seen , in different manners .",
    "the entanglement of formation was proposed by bennett _",
    "et al._@xcite as the infimum of mean pure state entanglement among all possible ensemble descriptions of a mixed state @xmath26 .",
    "the concurrence was developed by wootters and collaborators @xcite in the context of trying to figure out a feasible way to calculate the entanglement of formation .",
    "thus @xmath28 and @xmath27 are connected by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and it is assumed that @xmath32 .",
    "the concurrence can be defined by @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath35 in decreasing order and @xmath36 is the pauli matrix .    on the other hand the negativity uses the idea of partial transpose to calculate entanglement @xcite .",
    "it can be defined as @xmath37 where the subscript @xmath38 indicates the partial transpose operation and @xmath39 means the trace norm .",
    "alternatively , one can define the logarithmic negativity as @xcite @xmath40 .",
    "let us use these quantifiers to study the entanglement of thermal - equilibrium states , @xmath41 subject to a completely non - local hamiltonian of the form @xcite @xmath42 note that the 1d 2-qubit heisenberg chain is a particular case of when @xmath43 ( @xmath44 being the ferromagnetic and @xmath45 the antiferromagnetic cases ) .",
    "the results are plotted in figs .",
    "[ c ] , [ ln ] , and [ ef ] .",
    "+     +   +     +    an interesting conclusion following from the figures is that according to @xmath46 the transition is of @xmath22 order , according to @xmath27 ( and @xmath29 as well ) and @xmath47 it is of @xmath48 order , and remember that , according to @xmath24 all transitions are discontinuous .",
    "in fact it is possible to see , directly from its definition , that @xmath47 will always present a discontinuity in the same derivative as @xmath29 . for this aim we can write : @xmath49 similarly , the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath27 can be also verified analytically .",
    "the derivative of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath50 is @xmath51 so it is possible to see that , even @xmath52 being singular at @xmath53 ( it is , when @xmath25 ) , the singularity manifests itself on @xmath54 only to the next order .",
    "in fact , this situation resembles that in percolation theory , when different `` percolation quantifiers '' like probability of percolation , the mean size of the clusters , and the conductivity between two points show different critical behaviour@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite , the authors show that the concurrence and the negativity serve themselves as quantum - phase - transition indicators .",
    "this is because , unless artificial occurrences of non - analyticities , these quantifiers will present singularities if a quantum phase transition happens .",
    "an extend result for another bipartite entanglement quantifiers is presented in ref.@xcite . in the same context , rajagopal and",
    "rendell offer generalizations of this theme to the more general case of mixed state@xcite .    by following the same line of research",
    "we now extend the previous results to the multipartite case .",
    "we will see that it is possible to establish some general results , similar to ref.@xcite , also in the multipartite scenario .",
    "we can use for this aim the _ witnessed entanglement _ , @xmath55 , to quantify entanglement @xcite ( this way of quantifying entanglement includes several entanglement monotones as special cases , such as the robustness and the best separable approximation measure ) . before giving the definition of @xmath56 we must review the concept of entanglement witnesses . for all entangled state @xmath26",
    "there is an operator that witnesses its entanglement through the expression @xmath57 with @xmath58 for all @xmath59-separable states @xmath60 ( we call @xmath59-separable every state that does not contain entanglement among any @xmath61 parts of it , and denote this set @xmath62 ) @xcite",
    ". we are now able to define @xmath56 .",
    "the witnessed entanglement of a state @xmath26 is given by @xmath63 where the choice of @xmath64 allows the quantification of the desired type of entanglement that @xmath26 can exhibit .",
    "the minimization of @xmath65 represents the search for the optimal entanglement witness @xmath66 subject to the constraint @xmath67 .",
    "the interesting point is that by choosing different @xmath64 , @xmath56 can reveal different aspects of the entanglement geometry and thus quantify entanglement under several points of view . as a matter of fact , if in the minimization procedure in it is chosen to search among witnesses @xmath68 such that @xmath69 ( @xmath10 is the identity matrix ) , @xmath56 is nothing more than the _ generalized robustness _ , an entanglement quantifier @xcite with a rich geometrical interpretation @xcite .",
    "other choices of @xmath64 would reach other known entanglement quantifiers @xcite .",
    "moreover it is easy to see that , regardless these choices , @xmath56 is a bilinear function of the matrix elements of @xmath26 and of @xmath66 .",
    "so singularities in @xmath26 or in @xmath66 cause singularities in @xmath55 .    at this moment",
    "we can follow wu _ et al .",
    "_ , in ref .",
    "@xcite and state that , if some singularity occurring in @xmath56 is not caused by some artificial occurrences of non - analyticity ( _ e.g. _ , maximizations or some other mathematical manipulations in the expression for @xmath56 - see conditions a - c in theorem 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , then a singularity in @xmath56 is both necessary and sufficient to signal a pt .",
    "it is important to note that the concept of pt considered by the authors is not thermal equilibrium pt : the pt s discussed by them are that linked with non - analyticities in the derivatives of the ground state energy with respect to some parameters as a coupling constant . on the other hand it is also important to highlight that our result implies a multipartite version of theirs .",
    "moreover , the use of @xmath56 to studying quantum phase transitions can result in a possible connection between critical phenomena and quantum information , as @xmath56 ( via the robustness of entanglement ) is linked to the usefulness of a state to teleportation processes @xcite .",
    "we can go further in the concept of a pt and study the cases where @xmath56 presents a singularity .",
    "an interesting case is when a discontinuity happens in @xmath66 and not in @xmath26 .",
    "this can happen for example if the set @xmath62 presents a sharp shape , situation in which occurs the recently introduced _",
    "_ geometric phase transition__@xcite , where the pt is due the geometry of @xmath62 .",
    "besides the interesting fact that a new kind of quantum phase transition can occur , the geometric pt could be used to study the entanglement geometry .",
    "this can be made by smoothly changing some density matrix and establishing whether @xmath56 reveals some singularity .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 can be experimentally evaluated , as witness operators are linked with measurement processes @xcite and has been used to attest entanglement experimentally @xcite .",
    "so , the geometry behind entanglement can even be tested experimentally . a more detailed study of this issue is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "when some parameter of the systems is changed .",
    "geometrically , entanglement witness can be interpreted as tangent hyperplanes to @xmath62 . at a certain point",
    "both witnesses @xmath70 and @xmath71 are optimal for @xmath26 . at this point",
    "there is a singularity in @xmath72.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "summarizing , we have shown that entangled thermal - equilibrium systems naturally present a phase transition when heated : the entanglement - disentanglement transition .",
    "however different entanglement quantifiers lead with this pt differently , in the sense that , according to some of them the pt is of @xmath48-order ( _ e.g. _ , the negativity and concurrence ) , @xmath22-order ( _ e.g. _ , the entanglement of formation ) , and even though discontinuous ( _ e.g. _ , the indicator measure ) . with these ideas in mind",
    "it is tempting to make some questions : is the pt showed here linked with some other physical effect other than just vanishing quantum correlations ?",
    "in other words , which macroscopically observed pt have entanglement as order parameter ?",
    "can the way in which entanglement quantifiers lead with pt be considered a criterion for choosing among them ?",
    "is there `` the good '' quantifier to deal with such pt ?",
    "we hope our present contribution can help in answering these questions .",
    "recent discussions have shown that the entanglement - disentanglement transition is behind important quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "so similar analysis can also be performed in different contexts other than temperature increasing .",
    "decoherence processes could be a rich example .",
