    "almost all hgmn stars exhibit a strong absorption feature at 3984   , which has been identified as a line of .",
    "the wavelength at which this line is observed depends on the isotopic mix of hg ( white et al .",
    "1976 ) , which ranges from the terrestrial mix to nearly pure @xmath0hg .",
    "mercury is not the only very heavy element observed in hgmn stars .",
    "lines of  ( dworetsky & vaughan 1973 ) and  ( guthrie 1985 ) are also observed .",
    "dworetsky & vaughan ( 1973 ) studied the  @xmath1 line in a sample of nine hgmn stars .",
    "this line is the strongest pt line at optical wavelengths , and in the nine stars studied it is shifted toward longer wavelengths by 0.04 to 0.09   , with respect to the centroid of the terrestrial platinum line .",
    "these shifts are interpreted as an isotopic effect .",
    "the corresponding anomalies are analogous to those found for hg , in the sense that the heavier isotopes tend to dominate in cooler stars .",
    "neither radiatively driven diffusion nor any other theory until now can account satisfactorily for the variations in the hg and pt isotope mix among the hgmn stars ( leckrone et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the main purpose of the work reported here was to provide additional observational constraints to guide the theorists in the understanding of the isotopic anomalies in hgmn stars , improving upon previous studies through the much better data quality obtainable now .",
    "thanks to the availability of new laboratory measurements of isotope shifts in  ( engleman 1989 ) it became possible to identify more definitely the  isotopes .",

    "the observed wavelength ranges are 39654000    and 40184035   .",
    "synthetic spectra and model atmospheres were computed with the synthe and atlas9 codes ( kurucz 1997 ) , respectively .",
    "a code similar to the tefflogg code of moon & dworetsky ( 1985 ) , but based on new computed uvbybeta indices , was used to obtain the stellar parameters ( castelli &  kurucz 1994 ) .",
    "observed indices were taken from the mermilliod , mermilliod , & hauck catalogue ( 1997 ) and were dereddened using the uvbybeta code of moon ( 1985 ) .",
    "for all the stars we assumed zero microturbulent velocity , while the rotational velocity was derived from the comparison of the observed and computed spectra , after having degraded the computed spectra for the broadening due to the instrumental profile .",
    "for the whole transition of  3983     we adopted @xmath4 ( dworetsky 1980 ) .",
    "for each isotopic and hyperfine component this value was scaled in agreement with each observed relative intensity . for reference , the terrestrial intensities from kurucz ( 1993 ) and from smith ( 1997 ) were adopted .",

    "the isotopic and hyperfine shifts and intensities were either taken directly from engleman ( 1989 ) or were derived from engleman ( 1989 ) and kalus et al .",
    "one of the programme stars with very sharp lines is the double - lined spectroscopic binary @xmath7  lup . an updated version of the binary code of kurucz ( 1993",
    ", cd - rom 18 ) has yielded as final computed spectrum the spectrum resulting from the contribution of both components .",
