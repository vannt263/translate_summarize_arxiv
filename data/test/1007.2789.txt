    "the dimension 2 gluon condensate @xmath0 in pure yang - mills theory has been proposed in @xcite , and it has been investigated in different ways since then @xcite .    in @xcite an analytical framework for studying this condensate has been developed , based on work carried out in the gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "different problems had to be overcome .",
    "first of all there is the gauge invariance of this condensate . in order to make the operator @xmath1 gauge invariant",
    ", one can take the minimum of its integral over the gauge orbit . since @xmath2 , with @xmath3 , is positive",
    ", this minimum will always exist . in a general gauge , however , the minimum is a highly nonlocal and thus hard to handle expression of the gauge field .",
    "a minimum is however reached in the landau gauge ( @xmath4 ) , though , so that working in this gauge reduces the operator to a local expression . secondly adding a source @xmath5 , coupled to @xmath1 ,",
    "makes the theory nonrenormalizable at the quantum level . to solve this , a term quadratic in the source must be added , which in turn spoils the energy interpretation of the effective action .",
    "one way around this is to perform the legendre inversion , but this is rather cumbersome , especially so with a general , spacetime dependent source .",
    "one can also use a hubbard - stratonovich transform , which introduces an auxiliary field ( whose interpretation is just the condensate ) and eliminates the term quadratic in the source .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the result was that the yang - mills vacuum favors a finite value for the expectation value of @xmath1 .",
    "the precise renormalization details of the procedure proposed in @xcite were given in @xcite .",
    "recently , chernodub and ilgenfritz @xcite have considered the asymmetry in the dimension two condensate .",
    "they performed lattice simulations , computing the expectation value of the electric - magnetic asymmetry in landau gauge , which they defined as @xmath6 at zero temperature , this quantity must of course be zero due to lorentz invariance .",
    "necessarily it can not diverge as divergences at finite @xmath7 are the same as for @xmath8 , hence this asymmetry is in principle finite and can be computed without renormalization , for all temperatures .",
    "a first remark concerns the visibility of the ( de)confinement phase transition in the value of the asymmetry@xcite . at temperatures lower than the critical one",
    ", the asymmetry goes from zero at zero temperature to a positive value , which reaches a maximum at the critical temperature . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the asymmetry decreases and becomes negative when @xmath9 .",
    "the two transition points the phase transition temperature and the symmetric point where the asymmetry goes through zero divide the temperature range in three regions .",
    "these seem to coincide with those associated with the condensed , liquid , and gaseous states of the magnetic monopoles , whose dynamics are closely related to confinement and deconfinement ( see , for example , @xcite ) . at yet higher temperatures , one would expect the perturbative behavior to kick in , which goes like @xmath10 at lowest order .",
    "however , lattice artifacts prohibit lattice computations at sufficiently high temperatures to see this @xcite .    at low temperatures , from thermodynamical arguments one would expect an exponential fall - off with the lowest glueball mass in the exponent , @xmath11 .",
    "instead , the authors of @xcite found an exponential with a mass @xmath12 significantly smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "so far , there is no explanation for this behavior .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors and collaborators have extended the framework from @xcite to include the asymmetry @xmath14 . in that article ,",
    "the potential was computed for @xmath8 , and no non - trivial value for the asymmetry was found  as is necessary for lorentz invariance . in this paper",
    "we extend the computations in order to include finite temperature effects , with the aim of shedding more light on the results of @xcite . in section [ prel ]",
    "we give a short review of what was found in @xcite , which is then continued by a computation of the finite temperature effective action in section [ tr ] . in section [ min ]",
    "we find and discuss the minima of the potential , the values of the different condensates and their temperature dependence .",
    "section [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "in @xcite the effective action in the presence of a dimension two condensate and of an asymmetry was computed . since the starting point for the calculations when @xmath15 are identical",
    ", we shortly review the steps taken in @xcite .",
    "the starting point to compute the effective potential is the following lagrangian density : @xmath16 where the following couplings have been introduced : @xmath17 to one - loop order .",
    "the vacuum expecation values of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 fields are @xmath20 in order to simplify notations , we set @xmath21 which denote an effective mass and an effective mass matrix . with these notations , the condensates",
    "as defined with the conventions of @xcite are @xmath22 where the latin index denotes the space components .    with these givens",
    "it is possible to compute the effective action for a space - time independent @xmath23 and @xmath24 using the background field formalism .",
    "we separate the two fields into a classical part and quantum fluctuations , after which the fluctuations can be integrated out . expanding the resulting path integral over @xmath25 to one - loop order",
    "gives @xmath26 + \\frac{n^2 - 1}2 \\operatorname{tr}\\ln \\left ( -\\partial^2\\delta_{\\mu\\nu } + \\left(1-\\frac1\\xi\\right)\\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu + \\delta_{\\mu\\nu } g\\sigma ' + m_{\\mu\\nu}\\right ) \\;,\\ ] ] where the limit @xmath27 is implied , as we work in the landau gauge .",
    "as we are interested in the asymmetry , we parametrize the mass matrix as @xmath28 i.e. we preserve rotational invariance in the spatial part . with this form",
    ", the @xmath29 in the effective potential can be split into different parts , and in the limit @xmath27 we get @xmath30 + \\frac{n^2 - 1}2\\operatorname{tr}\\ln ( -\\partial^2 ) + \\frac{n^2 - 1}2(d-2 ) \\operatorname{tr}\\ln\\left(-\\partial^2+m^2-\\frac { a}{d-1}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{n^2 - 1}2\\operatorname{tr}\\ln\\left(-\\partial^2+m^2 + a\\left(1-\\frac{d}{d-1}\\frac{\\partial_0 ^ 2}{\\partial^2}\\right)\\right ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "at finite @xmath7 and in euclidean space - time , the spectrum of @xmath31 is discrete  the eigenvalues are @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the matsubara frequencies and @xmath34 is the momentum in the spacelike directions .",
    "it happens to be convenient to take the second and the last terms of together ( mark that @xmath35 in dimensional regularization does not vanish for finite @xmath7 , but it gives a constant contribution to the energy ) , so that we have to compute the following traces :    [ beginnetje ] @xmath36    the sums can be computed using standard techniques . in order to have convergent sums , one first writes ( for concreteness , consider the first sum ) : @xmath37 then the sum can be computed , for example using a formula derived from the product representation for the sine function : @xmath38 where we have taken the logarithm of both sides of the first identity , and subsequently taken the derivative with respect to @xmath39 . applying this to our sum and performing the indefinite integral in @xmath40",
    ", we find @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant of integration . by considering the @xmath43 limit",
    ", one can show that it must be equal to @xmath44 .",
    "this gives the result that @xmath45 this can be split into the @xmath8 contribution and a finite temperature correction : @xmath46 where we have set @xmath47 in the temperature correction .",
    "the second expression can be computed in an analogous way , except that the numerator in the sum is a fourth - order polynomial , and it is thus necessary to split the fraction in partial fractions .",
    "we find the temperature correction to the trace to be equal to @xmath48 where we have used the short - hand notations @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "from @xcite we already know the zero - temperature effective potential .",
    "if we add the temperature correction found above , we can start the work of searching for minima .",
    "as the expressions involved are pretty much unhandleable , we use two strategies : expanding in series gives some analytical insight in the low- and high-@xmath7 behavior , and numerical minimization gives a global view of the temperature dependence . for the numerical part ,",
    "we have used @xmath51 , the value of @xmath52 in the non - perturbative minimum at zero temperature@xcite , and @xmath53 .",
    "it is possible to have @xmath54 shift as @xmath52 gets modified at finite temperature ; this , however , does not significantly change the results .      plotting and visually inspecting",
    "the potential reveals only one minimum , which coincides with the already known non - perturbative minimum at @xmath8 .",
    "one would expect the zero - temperature perturbative solution to become a saddle - point of the potential at finite @xmath7 , but it turns out that this saddle - point can only be found from @xmath55 onwards . for lower temperatures it seems that the saddle - point is located in a region of the parameter space where the effective potential has an imaginary part . for slightly higher temperatures , the saddle - point and the non - perturbative minimum merge and from a temperature of @xmath56 onwards",
    "no solutions to the gap equation can be found anymore .",
    "we will say more about this in paragraph [ hoget ] .",
    "the values of the condensates in the non - perturbative minimum are plotted in figure [ eerstefiguur ] . in this figure",
    "we have used the sign and prefactor conventions of @xcite instead of those from @xcite , which means that the value of @xmath0 , being the opposite of @xmath18 , is negative .",
    "we see that the absolute value of @xmath0 is slightly lowered by raising the temperature .",
    "the asymmetry is positive and rising , just as was found on the lattice in @xcite .",
    "our value for the asymmetry seems to be slightly lower , but as we have only done a one - loop calculation , one can not expect the results to have very high accuracy .     condensate ( full line ) and the asymmetry @xmath14 ( dashed line ) as functions of the temperature , in units @xmath57 .",
    "[ eerstefiguur],width=264 ]    in figure [ elem ] the values of the electric part and the magnetic part are plotted separately . at @xmath8",
    "both are , naturally , equal .",
    "when increasing the temperature , the electric component goes up , while the magnetic component remains approximately constant .",
    "this is also what has been found on the lattice@xcite .",
    "similar conclusions for correlations in the gluon condensate were also found in @xcite .",
    "condensate as function of the temperature .",
    "( the magnetic component has been divided by three to be able to compare with the electric component . )",
    "[ elem],width=264 ]      analytically , the limit @xmath58 can be considered . in order to find the dominant behavior",
    ", we proceed as follows : first , the exponentials in the integrals are small for small @xmath7 , meaning that @xmath59 .",
    "then , we expand the square roots for small @xmath60 . the expansion of the square root will only be valid up to a certain value of @xmath60 , but this is still a legitimate step as the greater values of @xmath60 hardly contribute due to exponential suppression . in the expansion we only keep the terms up to the first non - trivial order of @xmath60 , after which the integrals can be easily evaluated .",
    "we find that the three integrals in the potential have lowest - order behavior @xmath61 respectively .",
    "it is clear that , for low @xmath7 , the second integral will dominate .",
    "if we take this to be the first low - temperature correction , we find for the asymmetry @xmath62 and ( to this order in the temperature ) there is no correction to @xmath63 . if we apply a fit to the low - temperature part of our numerical data , the two results are in nice agreement .",
    "mark that , as there is no @xmath64 correction to @xmath63 but there is a positive one to @xmath14 , the magnetic component of the condensate will decrease its value , or increase its absolute value , as can be seen in figure [ elem ] .",
    "this is in opposition to the behavior of the electric component , which only decreases in absolute value .",
    "the increase in @xmath65 is small , however , and it is not sure how higher - loop correction will influence this result .    in @xcite",
    "it was found that the value of the asymmetry was best described by an exponential form @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "they , however , only had data for @xmath68 . for such higher temperatures ,",
    "the lowest order in the expansion is , of course , not sufficient , and the exponential corrections can not be ignored anymore . in order to investigate the behavior of the asymmetry , the numerical results have to be used again .",
    "it turns out to be very difficult to find a fit good enough in broader intervals .",
    "given the complexity of the analytical expressions and given the fact that we have only done the calculations up to one - loop order , it is not possible to say more about it , however .",
    "mark that , given the fact that our model has a mass gap , one would expect an exponential behavior with the effective gluon mass in the exponential .",
    "our not finding this is due to the landau gauge prescription : the last inverse propagator in does not correspond to a simple yukawa form when the asymmetry becomes nonzero .",
    "one should mark that the landau gauge is singled out as the gauge where @xmath0 reaches its minimum along the gauge orbit , giving this condensate a physical meaning .",
    "this is not the case with the asymmetry , and as such it is not all that surprising to find a non - exponential behavior for it .      in order to get more insight in the disappearance of all solutions to the gap equation at higher @xmath7",
    ", we will expand the effective potential in this limit .",
    "herefore it is necessary we return to and do the integrations first , receiving , for example , for the first expression @xmath69 this can be expanded in high @xmath7 , but one sees that the @xmath70 term has to be split off . we find : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the term with @xmath73 will give a pole in the @xmath74 limit . the second contribution from",
    "can be expanded analogously .",
    "all together , we find the following high-@xmath7 expansion : @xmath75 where we have dropped the @xmath64 term , as it does not depend on the fields in any way and is , thus , irrelevant .",
    "now one has to keep in mind that , at high temperatures , one expects the fields to scale with the temperature , and that all terms in the expansion above are effectively of the same order in @xmath7 .",
    "however , one expects to have that @xmath76 , making the above series one in @xmath77 , with the first two terms being of the same order . solving the gap equation perturbatively yields at lowest order @xmath78 and for the condensates : @xmath79 this is exactly the result one expects from a perturbative computation .",
    "going to higher order in this expansion , some subtleties are encountered .",
    "first note that the effective gluon masses squared are negative , and the next term in the expansion contains square roots of the masses .",
    "this gives an imaginary part to the potential .",
    "another point of note is the fact that our expansion has effectively become a series in the coupling @xmath77 instead of one in the temperature .",
    "this means that , when going to higher order in @xmath80 , one has to take into account the effect of higher - loop diagrams .",
    "these two problems are actually related .",
    "it has been known for a long time that , at higher temperatures , the perturbation series must be reorganized . in ordinary pure yang  mills theory ,",
    "this amounts to giving the timelike gluon a debye mass @xmath81 , which effectively resums the hard ( high momentum ) contributions of the diagrams in figure [ debye1 ] . in our formalism , however , there are four additional vertices .",
    "this gives rise to four extra diagrams that need to be resummed .",
    "they are shown in figure [ debye2 ] .",
    "computing these diagrams , it turns out that they exactly cancel the lowest - order contribution from the condensate .    ,",
    "width=151 ]     part of the lco lagrangian , and again the same two diagrams from the @xmath19 part of the lco lagrangian .",
    "the index `` @xmath82 , @xmath83 '' has been added to remind of the fact that this depicts the two four - gluon vertices coming from the lco formalism .",
    "the dotted line is the @xmath18 or @xmath84 propagator .",
    "[ debye2],width=151 ]    when doing this resummation , one has to watch out for double counting , which can happen when considering diagrams without external lines@xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that this double counting is put right by the mismatch in symmetry factors in the diagrammatic expansion of the vacuum energy .",
    "as such , we can proceed without worrying about this . adding the resummed diagrams to the result found in , we find up to the effective order @xmath85 : @xmath86 where , again",
    ", terms not containing the fields @xmath87 and @xmath88 have been dropped . again solving this perturbatively , we find : @xmath89 and analogously for @xmath63 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is exactly what one would expect from perturbation theory .",
    "we computed the effective action of su(@xmath90 ) landau gauge yang - mills theory in the presence of a dimension two condensate and an asymmetry in this condensate .",
    "figure [ eerstefiguur ] is the main result of this article .",
    "we find good qualitative agreement with the numerical results of @xcite , with some discrepancies due to different definitions  we define the condensates with the perturbative contributions subtracted , whence they vanish in the high temperature , perturbative , regime .",
    "the quantitative agreement is less excellent , but as our computations are just one - loop and the coupling is not all that small , one may not hope for miracles . a two - loop treatment , however , is intractable , even at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "the low-@xmath7 behavior seems to be best described by @xmath91 , as a naive computation in an abelian higgs model would lead us to expect@xcite .",
    "the mismatch with the exponential fit found in @xcite is probably due to their having data only for @xmath68 . at high temperatures it turns out that resummation _",
    " la _ hard - thermal - loop is necessary , and not doing this will give no solutions when imposing that the effective action be real .",
    "after resumming the necessary diagrams , the perturbative values for the condensates are recovered .",
    "no non - perturbative solutions are found .",
    "the only part of the temperature range where we can not boast good results is around the phase transition .",
    "at that point the temperature is already too high to trust a simple one - loop computation , and the high - temperature expansion can not be expected to still yield good results at a temperature so low .",
    "when this article was in preparation , we learned that lattice computations for the full dimension two condensate and for the electric and magnetic components separately at finite temperature have been completed@xcite .",
    "qualitative agreement is again good . for @xmath92",
    ", it is indeed found that the electric component shows much more temperature dependence than the magnetic component , which is nearly constant in that range .",
