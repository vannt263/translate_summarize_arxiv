    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ferromagnetic xy model has had a long history of studies concerning the dynamics of spinwaves at low temperatures .",
    "it was first analyzed by villain@xcite and by moussa and villain@xcite , for low temperatures , in the harmonic approximation .",
    "they found that the dynamic structure function @xmath1 has a spinwave peak of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the critical exponent describing the decay of the static spin - spin correlation function , and @xmath5 is the spinwave frequency at wavevector @xmath6 .",
    "nelson and fisher@xcite treated the model in a fixed - length hydrodynamic description , obtaining the following expression around the spinwave peak , @xmath7 where for small @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the spinwave velocity .",
    "these theoretical approaches led to spinwave peaks diverging unphysically at the spinwave frequency . here",
    "we describe an alternative theoretical description in which the divergence does not occur .    at higher temperatures ,",
    "the spinwave or harmonic approximation begins to fail , and xy magnets are known to undergo a topological phase transition@xcite associated with the unbinding of vortices .",
    "we generally consider temperatures below this unbinding temperature @xmath11 , where a spinwave approximation will be valid . at very low temperatures",
    "any nonlinear effects should be very weak , do not lead to vortex production , and can be included as the damping or scattering of the spinwave modes , that results in a spinwave lifetime .",
    "thus our approach will be to start from the harmonic approximation to the spin hamiltonian , @xmath12 , and then include the damping that results from the terms fourth order in spin operators ( @xmath13 ) in an expansion of the original full spin hamiltonian , @xmath14 . the resulting damping strength @xmath0 will imply a finite lifetime @xmath15 for the spinwave modes .",
    "we are interested to investigate whether the presence of such lifetime effects can eliminate the divergence of the dynamic structure function @xmath1 at the spinwave frequency .",
    "we calculate the spinwave damping by a feynmann diagram technique for finite temperatures , applied to the fourth - order hamiltonian @xmath13 , using the leading diagrams to second order in @xmath13 .",
    "the only diagrams we include are those that give a contribution to the _ imaginary part _ of the spinwave energy , i.e. , to the damping or inverse lifetime .",
    "these are the terms that involve a _",
    "dynamical _ effect on the spinwave energies .",
    "the associated integral expressions for these diagrams require the evaluation of four - dimensional integrals involving a delta - function .",
    "methods for evaluating this type of integral in three dimensions have been developed by gilat and co - workers ; here we show how to extend their work and apply the same technique in four dimensions . in principle , we could also use the feynmann technique to determine the leading changes in the _ real part _ of the spinwave energy , @xmath16 , due to the perturbation @xmath13 .",
    "this real part would result as the usual effect due to finite temperature : a shift in the spinwave frequencies to lower values as the temperature increases .",
    "it is essentially a _ static _",
    "effect , primarily due to the renormalization of the nearest neighbor exchange interaction strength @xmath17 with temperature .",
    "calculation of these spinwave frequency shifts by the feynmann technique would require including diagrams first order in @xmath13 ; the so - called single - loop diagrams . in this paper ,",
    "however , we are primarily concerned with accounting for dynamical effects .",
    "we will include the renormalization of the spinwave energies using the memory function formalism , combined with some input information from classical monte carlo ( mc ) data . in the memory function approach ,",
    "the position of the spinwave peak in @xmath1 does not occur exactly at the zero - temperature dispersion relation , @xmath5 , but rather , close to the value @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the temperature - dependent second moment .",
    "@xmath19 can be estimated from static quantities , either using low - temperature analytic expressions or results from monte carlo , the latter being necessary for temperatures approaching @xmath11 .",
    "the memory function approach already includes to leading order the exchange strength renormalization , as can be seen in the shift in the position of the spinwave peaks .",
    "thus we use it rather than making any renormalization of the exchange @xmath17 .",
    "a few comments can be made about how the damping @xmath0 is included into the memory function calculation .",
    "note that the damping calculation sketched above is completely independent of the memory function calculation ; the latter is a formalism for calculating dynamic correlations for a given hamiltonian and operators .",
    "due to the xy symmetry of the model , the natural coordinates of the spins are the in - plane angle @xmath20 and out - of - plane spin component @xmath21 .",
    "fourier transforming and using a standard canonical transformation , the hamiltonian is written in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with time dependencies varying as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . once damping is included , the time dependencies become @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "henceforth the calculation proceeds as usual in the memory function approach , except for this small modification of the operator time dependencies via the shifted operator frequencies , @xmath28 . in the memory function calculation ,",
    "spinwave sum and difference processes enter .",
    "these are characterized by combinations of frequencies , @xmath29 , where @xmath6 is the wavevector at which the dynamic correlations are measured , and @xmath30 is summed over to include all possible such processes .",
    "based on the above modifications of the operator frequencies , there also results the modification for these processes , @xmath31 .",
    "the damping rates for different wavevectors always add for both types of processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , in sec .",

    "thus it is interesting to see whether the spinwave width and shape are better described by this theory at higher temperature , because the theoretical damping rates grow as @xmath117 .",
    "the other reason to look at higher temperature is to consider how the background intensity in @xmath1 for frequencies @xmath291 , depends on the temperature .",
    "for one thing , the increase in temperature should spread all of the finite - size effect peaks and smooth the spinwave background , but can be expected to raise its intensity as well . for comparison , as @xmath69 crosses the vortex unbinding temperature @xmath11 , previous mc - sd simulations@xcite show that this background grows with @xmath69 , until it dominates over the spinwave peak .",

    "the low - frequency background already dominates over the spinwave peak , if the latter can be seen at all .",

    "this effect is absent at @xmath296 , however , where the mc - sd and memory data coincide for low frequencies ; in this low temperature region the spinwave approximations used in the memory approach are valid . for temperatures near and above @xmath11",
    ", this extra central peak intensity , not described within the spinwave picture of the memory function approach , may possibly be attributed to nonlinear excitations , including specifically , vortices .",
    "this is consistent with the phenomenological vortex gas description of mertens et al:@xcite the excess central peak component is stronger for lower wavevectors , because the vortex pairs being generated above @xmath11 disorder the spins on long length scales .",
    "the presence of spinwave damping included into the memory function approach has been suggested here as a way in which finite amplitude spinwave peaks result in the 2d xy model , canceling the divergences in previous theories .",
    "a rough calculation of the damping strength has been made using the feynmann diagram technique applied to the quartic corrections of the harmonic hamiltonian .",
    "the diagrams used involve only two scattering events ; clearly this gives an underestimate of the damping , and it is likely that including the third order diagrams could make a substantial modification to the results .",
    "generally the damping @xmath115 obtained increases away from the center of the brilluoin zone , being close to zero near the center and being greatest along the ( 11 ) direction . in this classical calculation , the damping varies as the square of the temperature ; this results in extremely weak damping strength ( @xmath297 ) for temperatures below @xmath298 .",
    "as the temperature approaches and passes @xmath11 , the damping becomes comparable to the spinwave frequency .",
    "the comparison of the memory function data and mc - sd data for @xmath1 is good in several aspects : the theory gives finite spinwave peaks , they are positioned correctly for low temperatures , and the multiple finite - size - effect peaks are reproduced as in the mc - sd data .",
    "the most significant problem in the memory function approach is the extremely narrow peak widths  clearly caused by an underestimate of the true damping strength , especially at lower temperatures and wavevectors .",
    "for very low temperatures in the present theory , the longest wavelength spinwaves will not scatter even once before crossing the entire system .",
    "of course , this is a quantum picture , applied to the classical system , so perhaps a better approach in this low - t limit would be to consider some kind of adiabatic scattering in the nonuniform potential due to the spinwave population",
    ". this would essentially be the equivalent of the quantum calculation at very high order diagrams rather than at the lowest order .",
    "when the memory calculation is carried out for large systems , that is , in the continuum limit , the finite - size peaks merge into a smooth background .",
    "indeed , in this limit , the spinwave peak itself has contributions on the high frequency side from spinwave sum processes , and on the low frequency side from spinwave difference processes .",
    "the combination of all of these contributions , essentially an infinite number of sum and difference processes , leads to an overall smooth and nondivergent spinwave peak . even in the limit of _",
    "zero damping _ , the spinwave peak are nondivergent , according to continuum calculations [ using eqs .",
    "[ sigma_int ] ] by pereira et al.@xcite however , when damping is included , the heights of the spinwave peaks are smaller , and we expect the results to be more realistic .    in the memory function theory ,",

    "the function @xmath299 , to a leading approximation , is proportional to the temperature @xmath69 . from eq .",
    "( [ sqw - memory ] ) , in regions away from the spinwave peak @xmath1 should be proportional to @xmath299 .",
    "thus we see that the memory function theory demonstrates how the background grows with temperature while the spinwave peak relatively tends to fall . for high enough temperature ,",
    "the distribution of spinwave difference processes near zero frequency dominates the spectrum of @xmath1 , leading to a central peak stronger than the spinwave peak .",
    "clearly this means applying the theory well above the limiting temperature where we expect spinwave approximations to be valid .",
    "however , this gives results very similar to those in the mc - sd simulations , although the latter can be expected to include nonlinear effects such as vortices .",
    "in fact , we have seen a strong indication for nonlinear effects ( beyond spinwave difference processes ) above @xmath11 as extra intensity in @xmath1 near zero frequency in the mc - sd data .    in conclusion ,",
    "application of the memory function formalism , including a leading approximation to the mode damping , has been shown to accomplish three things for the xy model : i ) produce nondivergent spinwave peaks ; ii ) explain the finite size features in @xmath1 both above and below @xmath5 ; iii ) explain the background in @xmath1 below @xmath5 for the infinite system . note that strictly speaking , damping is necessary only for item ii ) , because @xmath1 can not be calculated in the memory function formalism for a finite system without damping .",

    "<S> the effect of damping of spinwaves in a two - dimensional classical ferromagnetic xy model is considered . the damping rate @xmath0 is calculated using the leading diagrams due to the quartic - order deviations from the harmonic spin hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting four - dimensional integrals are evaluated by extending the techniques developed by gilat and others for spectral density types of integrals . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is included into the memory function formalism due to reiter and solander , and menezes , to determine the dynamic structure function @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> for the infinite sized system , the memory function approach is found to give non - divergent spinwave peaks , and a smooth nonzero background intensity ( `` plateau '' or distributed intensity ) for the whole range of frequencies below the spinwave peak . </S>",
    "<S> the background amplitude relative to the spinwave peak rises with temperature , and eventually becomes higher than the spinwave peak , where it appears as a central peak . for finite - sized systems , </S>",
    "<S> there are multiple sequences of weak peaks on both sides of the spinwave peaks whose number and positions depend on the system size and wavevector in integer units of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamical finite size effects are explained in the memory function analysis as due to either spinwave difference processes below the spinwave peak or sum processes above the spinwave peak . </S>",
    "<S> these features are also found in classical monte carlo  spin - dynamics simulations .    </S>",
