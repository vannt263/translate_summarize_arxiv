    "the formation of galactic disks occurs because gas with net angular momentum is accreted into a potential well before forming stars ( e.g. , review by @xcite .",
    "the accretion can occur in two forms , where the gas is either at the temperature of the potential well ( hot ) , or well below that temperature .",
    "if the gas is hot , radiative cooling leads to the creation of cool gas near the bottom of the potential well ( the cooling flow model ) .",
    "alternatively , the gas might already be cool ( e.g. , ) falling nearly ballistically onto the disk ( cold flows ) , where it probably shocks and radiatively cools before settling down onto the disk .",
    "one or perhaps both of these processes were active when the galaxy disk formed and most of the disk stars were produced , typically 512 gyr ago .",
    "in addition , accretion may be going on today in local galaxies at modest accretion rates . gathering",
    "observational evidence for accretion today is of considerable importance since understanding accretion today can provide insights into the physics surrounding disk formation and evolution .    both hot and cold gas is seen in the vicinity or extremities of galaxies and it could be accretion material .",
    "examples of this are the high velocity clouds of neutral hydrogen around the milky way @xcite or m31 @xcite and the hot x - ray emitting atmospheres around edge - on spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emitting halos of galaxies are largely related to the degree and extent of star formation in the disk , so this component is most likely due to a galactic fountain @xcite .",
    "the situation with neutral gas likely points to at least two components : a galactic fountain origin for the intermediate velocity clouds ( and some high velocity clouds ) of ; and the accretion of extragalactic  clouds , either from nearby dwarf companions ( e.g. , the magellanic stream from the lmc and smc ) or through condensation out of an extensive , dilute hot halo ( much larger than 10 kpc and as yet unobserved in x - rays ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "metallicity can provide insights into these processes since galactic gas will be enriched , gas torn from dwarf galaxies is of lower metallicity , while condensations from a large dilute halo may be close to primordial .",
    "provided that these components can be separated either spatially or in velocity space , metallicities can identify their relative importance .",
    "the value of this approach is indicated by absorption line milky way studies , where some halo high velocity clouds are found to have low metallicity ( 0.3 solar ) , demonstrating that some extragalactic gas is being accreted by the milky way @xcite . until now ,",
    "similar observations have not been possible for external galaxies , as it would require a background source such as an agn to be projected behind the halo of an edge - on galaxy .",
    "exactly that situation exists for an agn that lies far behind the edge - on galaxy , ngc 891 , where the agn is projected 5 kpc from the galactic plane in the inner part of the galaxy ( see figure [ fig : agn ] ) .",
    "the edge - on galaxy ngc 891 is similar to the milky way in galaxy type and optical luminosity and it lies close enough ( 10 mpc ) that it has been mapped extensively in several ism components , including , x - ray emitting gas , and warm ionized gas @xcite .",
    "a heroic 21 cm observation @xcite is deep enough to map low column densities to heights as great as 22 kpc above the plane , and 9  of  gas lies in the halo .",
    "they argue that the  halo is a combination of infalling material and a galactic fountain .",
    "their  map covers the region of the agn , so the  column density along that sightline is known .",
    "their hi study leads to an essential improvement in our original analysis @xcite , since , by measuring the column density of metal lines , we can now determine the metallicity of the halo gas . in the following sections , we present the hst spectroscopic observations , the resulting column density , and the metallicity implied .",
    "we conclude with a summary and interpretation of these results .",
    "the background agn that we observed with hst / stis was identified as an x - ray source in a rosat image at j2000 coordinates ra , dec = 02222445,@xmath24221388 .",
    "the discovery technique , described in @xcite , used follow - up optical spectroscopy with the mdm 2.4 m telescope .",
    "a series of five 600 second exposures was obtained using the modular spectrograph on the mdm 2.4-m hiltner telescope during fall 1996 .",
    "the 85-mm camera with a 600l / mm grating was used in first order with a thinned , backside illuminated site ccd .",
    "the sampling was 4.7 angstoms per pixel .",
    "only the wavelength range of 3800 - 7600 angstroms is considered to prevent effects from overlapping spectral orders .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star feige 34 was used to flux calibrate the combined spectrum . however , the night was not photometric and thus only relative fluxes are available .",
    "these spectroscopic observations revealed this x - ray source near ngc 891 to be an agn that is projected upon the galaxy s halo only 106  ( 5.0 kpc ) from the disk and in the inner part of the galaxy , 11  along the disk direction ( @xmath3 kpc ) ; it has  = 18.7 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the optical discovery spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : mdmspec ] , which clearly identifies this as a broad - line quasar .",
    "this source was also identified by the serendipitous extragalactic x - ray source identification program as cxosexsi j022224.3 + 422139 @xcite , and follow - up optical spectroscopy in that program confirms our redshift determination and classification @xcite .",
    "we note that no other nearby edge - on galaxies in our discovery program had bright agns within their halos , making this a singular target .",
    "the metal line absorption data for this project were obtained with the stis spectrograph aboard hst on 6 september 2000 ; the qso was observed for a total of 13.2 ksec over the span of 10 orbits .",
    "these observations used the 52@xmath50.5  aperture , nuv - mama detector , and g230l grating centered on 2376  . with this setup ,",
    "the data cover a usable spectral range from 17503150   with a dispersion of 1.58   per pixel .",
    "the spectral resolution is 3.3   ( 413 ) fwhm at 2400  .",
    "the individual exposures were scaled by the exposure time and combined .",
    "we identified the continuum ( including qso emission lines ) along the lines described in the hst quasar absorption line key project @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spec ] shows the combined spectrum along with the continuum fit and propagated 3-@xmath6 errors .",
    "the resulting spectrum was searched for absorption features using the automated absorption line search algorithm available in the key project software .",
    "the procedure followed was identical to that described in @xcite .",
    "detected absorption lines were verified by eye .",
    "we also used specfit ( within stsdas ) and the fitting procedures within origin pro 8.5 to extract equivalent widths , obtaining similar results .",
    "it is essential to use the true instrumental line shape rather than just a gaussian , otherwise one will obtain systematically smaller equivalent widths .",
    "the qso spectrum lacks the bright emission lines usually associated with such objects , and in fact shows complex absorption in the  and emission line region ( near 2240  ) .",
    "corresponding absorption is seen near the very weak  emission line ( 2650  ) and the region where we expect  emission ( 2700  ) .",
    "indeed , the ] @xmath2 peak in the optical spectrum ( see figure [ fig : mdmspec ] ) also appears weaker then the composite quasar spectrum .",
    "the  line , while fairly strong , lacks the narrow component seen in the composite .",
    "it is well - fit by a gaussian with fwhm @xmath7   ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "a detailed qso classification requires additional spectroscopic analysis from a broader uv and optical band , and since we are only interested in the quasar as a background light source , such analysis is beyond the scope of the current work . due to the complexities of the qso  and  features",
    ", we have excluded these regions from our analysis .",
    "a number of absorption features were found with greater than 3-@xmath6 significance ; these are marked in figure [ fig : spec ] and listed in table [ tab : lines ] along with the best - fit line centers and equivalent widths . due to the poor spectral resolution ,",
    "each detected line was unresolved and we are unable to constrain the intrinsic line widths . to identify the absorbers , we first noted the expected galactic and ngc 891 lines .",
    "we clearly see the strong  @xmath92796,2803 doublet from ngc 891 , although it is partially blended with its galactic counterpart .",
    "the  @xmath102344 line is detected in both the galaxy and ngc 891 without contamination .",
    "unfortunately , there is severe blending of the  @xmath9 2374 , 2383 , likely with  forest lines .",
    "the best - fit decomposition is given in table [ tab : lines ] ( 17 - 24 ) but we can not obtain unique equivalent widths for these two lines at above 3-@xmath6 , so they are not used in the determination of the  column density . similarly , line blending in 25702610  while less severe , caused unacceptably large systematic uncertainties for the  @xmath9 2587 , 2600 lines , so the only line used for the analysis of the  column is the @xmath102344 line .",
    "we note that had we used these other lines , a larger  column density and metallicity would have resulted .",
    "the remaining lines did not match any expected metal resonance absorption lines from the galaxy or ngc 891 , and they were taken to be intervening absorption systems .",
    "a simple matching procedure was implemented to identify single systems with multiple features .",
    "we discover a strong absorber at @xmath11 with lines from , ,  @xmath101032 ,  @xmath101206 ,  @xmath91393,1402 , and  @xmath91548,1550 .",
    "the measured equivalent widths of these species are similar to those for other  absorption systems identified in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "remaining absorption lines were taken to be  if a corresponding feature at the same redshift could be identified , otherwise they were assumed to be  from intervening clouds .",
    "these results are included in table [ tab : lines ] for completeness , but they will not be discussed further in the present work .",
    "the wavelengths of the detected galactic lines were not consistent with zero velocity , indicating a wavelength zeropoint offset likely due to the source not being centered in the stis aperture .",
    "we estimated an offset of @xmath12   from the best - fit centers of the clean galactic absorption lines , assuming they were at @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to about 1 pixel or 0.025 , larger than the nominal pointing error of 0.01  ( with no source acquisition peak - up ) , but not uncommon .",
    "we adjusted the spectrum and measured line centers to correct for this offset ; those changes are reflected in table [ tab : lines ] and figure [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the lines from ngc 891 are largely consistent with the measured systemic velocity of @xmath14 , which is also close to the measured  velocity at this location above the disk @xcite .",
    "clean detections of  @xmath102344 , and  @xmath102803 from the halo of ngc 891 allow us to estimate column densities for these species .",
    "the  @xmath102853 absorption line is detected at 5@xmath6 at the milky way velocity but only at 3@xmath6 from ngc 891 , so we treat it as an upper limit . to obtain column densities",
    "requires corrections for the optical depth of the lines .",
    "there are not enough lines to fit a curve of growth for any one ion , from which a doppler broadening parameter would be obtained .",
    "fortunately , these ions and hi should be cospatial and the doppler broadening parameter is available directly from the 21 cm   observations , which are optically thin and have excellent velocity resolution . from the data that were obtained by @xcite , an  spectrum was extracted at the location of the background agn ( see figure [ fig : hispec ] ) .",
    "the spectrum shows a distribution that is typical of a rotating disk , having a flat - top profile with modest double - horns . to simplify matters",
    ", we fit the profile with a gaussian where the fwhm = 93 @xmath15 8 . from the zero moment map , the total  column along this line of sight is 1.3@xmath510@xmath16 . with this column and line width",
    ", the optical depth at line center may be quite significant , depending upon the elemental abundances , since depletion on to grains may be important .",
    "to infer the column densities for  @xmath102344 , and  @xmath102803 , we need to correct for optical depth effects , along with the ionization fraction .",
    "when the optical depth is small , the conversion is linear and independent of the number of components .",
    "however , for significant optical depths , the result depends not only on the equivalent width , the f value , and the doppler parameter , it depends on whether there are multiple components .",
    "the existence of multiple components as well as their properties can not be resolved with our data , so we proceed by assuming that the gas is uniformly distributed in the halo .",
    "later , we discuss the degree by which the inferred column density underestimates the value if multiple components exist .",
    "the most strongly affected line is  @xmath102803 , although the correction to  @xmath102344 is not negligible .    for a single - component model",
    ", we construct a curve of growth assuming the usual voigt profile with the doppler parameter taken from the  line , where @xmath17 .",
    "we use the atomic data from @xcite to determine oscillator strengths , statistical weights , and partition functions for each transition ( see @xcite for details of the curve of growth method ) .",
    "statistical uncertainties in the equivalent width determination and uncertainty in the doppler velocity parameter are propagated through to provide column density errors .",
    "additional uncertainties such as those associated with various assumptions are discussed below ( e.g. , we assume a single line characterized by a single value of @xmath18 , but there may be multiple lines ) .",
    "the  @xmath102344 line is close to the linear part of the curve of growth , with a correction factor to the equivalent width of 1.69 .",
    "the resulting column for  is @xmath19@xmath20 = 14.41 \\pm 0.14 $ ] , while the upper limit for the column is @xmath19@xmath20 = 12.67 $ ] ( statistical errors only ) .",
    "the  @xmath102803 line has an optical depth of about 70 at the line center and lies on the the flat part of the curve of growth .",
    "we calculate a column density of @xmath19@xmath20 = 15.48 ( + 0.36,-0.27)$ ] .",
    "to convert the equivalent width to a column density of an element requires a model for both the opacity effects ( discussed above ) and for the ionization fraction for the particular ionization state .",
    "we assume that photoionization controls the ion fractions and that the photons come from the disk of the galaxy .",
    "this is certainly not the entire story , as @xcite and @xcite have shown that photoionization models have difficulty reproducing the optical and infrared emission line data from the halo of ngc 891 .",
    "they conclude that there is likely to be a secondary source of ionization .",
    "@xcite reach a similar conclusion for milky way halo emission line gas and they suggest that the additional heating could be due to the dissipation of interstellar plasma turbulence .    even by ignoring this additional heating mechanism , the precise value of the ionization radiation field is only known roughly , with uncertainties from both models and the observational interpretation of emission lines .",
    "an important input to the models is the leakage of ionizing radiation from the disk , along with the propagation of uv radiation between the ionization edges of hydrogen ( 13.6 ev ) and the ions  ( 7.65 ev ) and  ( 7.9 ev ) , which provides the dominant amount of photoionization for  and   if too little of the radiation above 13.6 ev escapes .",
    "the propagation and escape of ionizing radiation has been calculated with various models ( e.g. , @xcite ) where the result depends on the structure of the ism and the degree to which radiation propagates through low density channels where absorption is minimized .",
    "these models are constrained by observations , such as by galaxy - wide emission line observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and by emission line observations directly from the halos of edge - on galaxies @xcite or from galactic high velocity clouds that are irradiated @xcite .",
    "we adopt a simple model for the ionizing and uv radiation reaching 5 kpc in which the shape of the radiation field is given by o stars and the value of the ionization parameter is constrained by @xcite .",
    "calculations were performed with cloudy version c08 , most recently described by @xcite .",
    "the ionizing photons pass through the halo  observed by @xcite prior to ionizing the gas at 5 kpc above the disk .",
    "we assume that the  is smoothly distributed at any particular height so that the plane - parallel approximation holds .",
    "the radiation softens as it rises upward through the  layer so that by the time it reaches 5 kpc , most of the radiation above 13.6 ev has been absorbed . from the work of @xcite , the ionization parameter u is likely in the range -6 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath21 -3.5 , from which we calculate that the ionization fractions of  and  exceed @xmath23 90% .",
    "there is a simple explanation for this result in that the  absorbs most of the photons above 13.6 ev , while the ionization potential for the transition to twice ionized species is 15.0 ev for  and 16.2 ev for .",
    "therefore , there are ample photons to ionize these elements to their first ionization state but not the second .",
    "for this reason , this result is nearly independent of the flux density of radiation emitted from the disk , the vertical form for the structure of the  or even the total column of provided they not orders of magnitude different than observed .",
    "there may be complications , discussed below , so for our limiting case , we adopt ionization fractions of 1.0 for these ions .    emission from ionized gas is detected to heights approaching 5 kpc @xcite , indicating that the mg and fe are not entirely singly ionized .",
    "models now try to take into account the complicated non - uniform gaseous structures that would be produced by supernovae @xcite . in their models with high ionizing fluxes",
    ", gas is nearly fully ionized at all heights above the plane , in conflict the the hi observations showing large amounts of hi above the disk . for models with lower ionizing fluxes ,",
    "the gas is ionized within 1 kpc of the plane , becoming entirely neutral at greater heights , consistent with our limiting case model .",
    "another relevant study is the absorption line study toward the globular clusters m3 and m5 at heights of 10 kpc and 5.3 kpc above the plane @xcite .",
    "they find that nearly all of the s along the sight lines are in the form of  or  with 50 - 75% of s as .",
    "the ionization potentials of is 10.4 ev , below that of  but about 3 ev above that of  or .",
    "the ionization potential for  is 23.3 ev , 7 - 8 ev above that of  or so we might estimate that about half of mg or fe is not in the form of  or  along these sight lines .",
    "we note that this determination of the relative ionization states of s probes a variety of heights from the disk up to the globular clusters , which may not be representative of the ionization state distribution for a sight line at a constant 5 kpc height above the plane . in the following ,",
    "we determine metallicities for the limiting case ( 100% of the mg and fe are singly ionized ) , acknowledging that lower ionization fractions would lead to larger metallicities , for mg and fe .",
    "some information is available for the ionized gas column densities at this height in the halo from optical balmer line emission and from x - ray studies .",
    "the x - ray observations show a hot halo of temperature about @xmath24 k , which is close to the value expected for hydrostatic equilibrium , so it is probably volume - filling @xcite .",
    "the x - ray emission leads to a density distribution , and along the absorption line of sight closest to the bulge , the column density is @xmath25 @xmath26 , less than the  column .",
    "this gas will not produce uv absorption lines , but it will provide an ambient pressure , which is @xmath27 k @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that @xmath29 k , balmer - emitting gas would have a density of @xmath30 @xmath28 , assuming it is in pressure equilibrium with the x - ray gas . to reproduce",
    "the observed balmer emission line intensity @xcite , the @xmath29 k gas only occupies 1% of the volume and has a column density thirty times less than the  column , so its contribution to the mass can be neglected .",
    "similarly , the , probably at @xmath31 k , would also occupy a small volume but its mass is measured directly and is the dominant component at this height .",
    "we can express the abundances of mg and fe relative to their solar abundances , for which we adopt a solar fe abundance of 7.50 and a solar mg abundance of 7.60 @xcite .",
    "this leads to [ fe / h ] = @xmath32 and [ mg / h ] = @xmath33 .",
    "these abundances do not take into account the depletion of metals onto grains .",
    "fortunately , fe and mg are found to be depeleted by different amounts along milky way sightlines , with the relative depletion difference being correlated with the total depletion @xcite . in all cases , the fe depletion is greater than that of mg , with the difference usually a factor of 210 ( 0.31.0 in the log ) . for absorption lines in milky way disk@xmath2halo",
    "gas , the average logarithmic depletion correction for fe is 0.92 and for mg is 0.6 . making these corrections , [ fe / h ] = -0.26 @xmath15 0.14 and [ mg / h ] = + 0.37 @xmath34 .",
    "if we were to use the depletion correction factors for warm disk gas , 1.22 for fe and 0.81 for mg ( in the log ) , the corrected abundances would be [ fe / h ] = 0.02 @xmath15 0.14 and [ mg / h ] = 0.58 @xmath34 . in either case",
    ", the metallicity of the gas is at least half solar and possibly above the solar value .    in this analysis",
    ", we assumed that the absorbing material is distributed continuously in the halo so that the line width is determined by the rotational velocity distribution of the halo .",
    "if the absorbing gas is confined to a few clouds or sheets , with line widths that are narrow compared to the rotational velocity , and where the lines are not overlapping , the inferred columns for fe and mg would be raised .",
    "the limiting case would be if the intrinsic thermal lines widths were so narrow that the lines lie on the damping part of the curve of growth , which can raise the columns by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this would lead to a metallicity about two orders of magnitude in excess of the solar value , an unlikely result .",
    "also , this correction would affect mg more than fe , so even more modest corrections could lead to highly supersolar values of [ mg / fe ] .",
    "for these reasons , we expect that our adopted model is not far from the truth , although the columns could be 2 - 3 times higher without having to adopt exotic models for the absorbing medium ( e.g. , an unmixed part of supernova ejecta ) .",
    "gas being accreted onto ngc 891 is unlikely to have near - solar abundances .",
    "for example , the hi high velocity gas around the milky way known as complex c , thought to be accretion material , has a metallicity of 0.1 - 0.3 z@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the gas is from the disk of the galaxy and it has been brought up to a height of 5 kpc by galactic disk processes .",
    "this favors a galactic fountain for the origin of the metal - bearing gas .",
    "if the disk metallicity in ngc 891 is similar to the milky way , this sight line above the inner disk should have a metallicity above the solar value .",
    "there is a considerable literature on  absorption lines seen against background agn spectra , although they tend to be at much larger impact parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies also have significantly higher spectral resolution , which permits them to study the velocity properties of the lines relative to the galaxy . from these studies ,",
    "the  absorbing material has a higher column density close to the galaxy and our value is consistent with some of the other absorption systems close to galaxies @xcite .",
    "this absorbing gas is not simply in rotation around the galaxy and various scenarios are suggested , such as where some of the gas is being accreted along the major axis with outflow along the minor axis @xcite .",
    "present observational limitations prevent us from making such velocity comparisons and due to the edge - on orientation , it will never be possible to comment on inflow vs outflow .",
    "however , higher spectral resolution observations will allow one to examine whether this gas is rotating like the  or involved in some different type of behavior , such as the inflow along a stream of accretion material .",
    "there are a number of improvements that are possible with additional uv absorption line observations .",
    "at the resolution of these observations , the lines in ngc 891 are not only unresolved , they are partly blended with weaker milky way lines . with",
    "higher spectral resolution , we could obtain equivalent widths for five separate  lines , covering a range of @xmath36 values .",
    "with such a set of lines , a more accurate column density is easily obtained , especially in the event that there are multiple components in a line , due to a non - uniform cool gas distribution . with a resolution of 20 km s@xmath37 or less , we would be able to resolve the rotation of the galaxy and determine abundances as a function of radial position in the galaxy .",
    "another important improvement would be to accurately determine the depletion factor in the gas . in this paper",
    ", we inferred the absolute depletion levels by using the relative depletions of two elements that are primarily not in the gas phase . a better way of measuring the depletion is to use at least one element that is primarily in the gas phase .",
    "low depletions are found in the refractory elements , such as o or s , which have uv resonance lines at wavelengths shorter than the stis observation presented here .",
    "both of these observational improvements are possible using the cos spectrograph on hst .",
