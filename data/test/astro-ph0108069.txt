    "there has been a great progress over the past several years in our understanding of galaxy evolution and formation .",
    "samples of normal galaxies are now studied out to @xmath5 ( @xcite ) , and several galaxies are now known at @xmath6 ( see @xcite for a review and references ) .",
    "quasars at @xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) also represent a valuable probe of both galaxy and structure formation , and the intervening primordial intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the observational frontier is now shifting to the formation of the first objects , protogalaxies and primordial agn , which is generally expected to occur some time in the redshift interval @xmath7 or so .",
    "as the first sources of uv radiation turn on , they reionize the universe , ending the `` dark ages '' which start at the recombination epoch ( @xmath8 ) . in this `` cosmic renaissance '' ( effectively , the start of the galaxy formation epoch ) the universe undergoes",
    "a phase transition from being neutral to being mostly ionized .",
    "detection of the reionization epoch would thus be a major cosmological milestone .",
    "the standard observational test is the prediction of an extended , optically thick absorption due to neutral hydrogen at @xmath9   ( @xcite ) .",
    "a limit to this effect at @xmath10 was published by @xcite . to date , only a gradual thickening of the absorption due to the ly@xmath11 forest was seen .    in this letter",
    "we present evidence which suggests that we are already probing the trailing end of the reionization era , at @xmath12 or so .",
    "the evidence is based on the high s / n , keck spectroscopy of the quasar sdss 10440125 discovered by @xcite .",
    "subsequent recent observations of quasars at @xmath13 by @xcite provide an additional evidence that the reionization era indeed occurs around @xmath14 .",
    "taken together , the available data support a picture of an extended and patchy reionization era , ending at @xmath15 .",
    "our low - resolution spectra were obtained on the w.  m.  keck observatory 10-m telescope ( keck i ) on ut 2000 december 30 , using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observations were obtained with the 400 lines mm@xmath16 grating ( @xmath17 ) through 1.2 arcsec slitlets , with two different slitmasks , with a mean dispersion of @xmath18   pixel@xmath16 , and a gg495 long - pass order - sorting filter .",
    "the first set , totalling 2400  s of integration , was at a slit position angle pa = 249.6@xmath19 , covering the quasar spectrum @xmath20   @xmath21 1 @xmath22 m , and a mean airmass @xmath23 .",
    "the second , with 3600  s of integration , was at pa = 137@xmath19 ( very close to parallactic angle at the time ) , covering @xmath24   @xmath21 1 @xmath22 m , and a mean airmass @xmath25 .",
    "the differential slit losses are estimated to be negligible for our purpose .",
    "individual integrations were dithered along the slit .",
    "data were reduced in iraf , using standard slit spectroscopy procedures .",
    "ne+ar arc lamp spectra obtained through the masks were used for wavelength calibrations , and the wavelength zeropoints adjusted using telluric emission lines .",
    "the night was photometric , but unfortunately no flux standards were observed with these slitmask+grating combinations , and we used an average of archival response curves for this grating obtained earlier .",
    "our spectroscopic magnitudes are in an excellent agreement with the ccd photometry presented by @xcite .    the combined lris spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "1 . it shows a dramatic drop due to the ly@xmath11 absorption at @xmath26  , and a second discontinuity at @xmath27  , due to the ly@xmath28 forest ( this may be the strongest detection of the ly@xmath28 drop observed to date ) . in order",
    "to estimate the possible continuum level in the absorbed region , we use three power - laws , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 $ ] , which span a plausible range for quasars .",
    "they have been normalized to @xmath31jy at 9000  , and are shown as dashed lines in fig . 1 .",
    "our high - resolution spectra were obtained on the w.  m.  keck observatory 10-m telescope ( keck ii ) on ut 2000 april 28 , ut 2001 january 1 and 2 , and ut 2001 march 24 , using the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used the echelle mode which contains ten orders , with a complete optical wavelength coverage , from @xmath32   to @xmath33  .",
    "the instrument has a spectral resolution of 11.4 km s@xmath16 pixel@xmath16 , and a mean dispersion in the wavelength region of interest here of @xmath34 pixel@xmath16 .",
    "a total of 11 exposures of 1800 s each were obtained , some in slightly non - photometric conditions .",
    "data were reduced using standard procedures .",
    "we used the program makee ( written by t. barlow ) to reduce the spectra .",
    "individual exposures from each night were combined prior to spectrum extraction using a rejection algorithm to remove cosmic rays .",
    "spectra were then optimally extracted .",
    "exposures of bright stars were used to provide the spectrum traces ( necessary due to a heavy absorption present in the quasar spectrum ) .",
    "dispersion solutions were found from exposures of arc lamps , spectra were corrected to the heliocentric system , and the wavelengths were transformed to vacuum values .",
    "the spectra for each night were flux calibrated using a single response curve measured during one of the nights , and averaged using the exposure time weighting",
    ".    since the flux zero - points for the esi data are uncertain , we convolved both esi and lris spectra with gaussians with @xmath35  , thus bringing them to effectively the same , very low resolution . from the ratio of these spectra we determined the flux correction factor , and applied it to the esi data .",
    "the final esi spectrum is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the absence of flux ( save for a few remaining narrow gaps in absorption ) in the wavelength interval @xmath36  , between the patch of the ly@xmath11 forest in the wavelength range @xmath37   and the quasar signal at @xmath38  , is quite striking .",
    "( the mg ii doublet at @xmath39   was noted by @xcite ; using a weighted average of several lines , we measure the absorber redshift to be @xmath40 . )",
    "the sharp ly@xmath28 drop at @xmath41   allows us to estimate a better redshift for the quasar : @xmath42 .",
    "this is less than 5.80 originally estimated by @xcite , for the following reason .",
    "the object was found to be a bal quasar by @xcite .",
    "we believe that its ly@xmath11 line is nearly completely absorbed , and that @xcite mistakenly interpreted the red half of the [ n v ] 1240 line as ly@xmath11 .",
    "this unfortunately precludes the study of the red wing of the ly@xmath11 absorption , which may contain useful information about the structure of the reionization front ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our redshift is supported by the possible ly@xmath43 line and a drop near @xmath44  , and a lyman limit ( clearly seen in the 2-d spectra images ) at @xmath45  .",
    "the effects of the blue bal wing of [ n v ] and ly@xmath11 may extend as far as @xmath46  , but this is not critical for our discussion below .",
    "there has been much recent progress in theoretical understanding and modeling of the reionization era ( excellent reviews include , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "a good understanding of the structure and extent of the reionization is important by itself , as it reflects the earliest phases of structure formation , and also for the modeling of cmbr foregrounds at high angular frequencies .",
    "a simple picture of a clean - cut gunn - peterson trough now appears unlikely .",
    "the key issue is the clumpiness of the igm , and the gradual development and clumpy distribution of the first ionizing sources , either protogalaxies or early agn ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the reionization is expected to occur gradually as the uv emissivity increases ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and ionization overcomes the recombination rate , with the lowest density regions becoming fully reionized first .",
    "this is also suggested by modern numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . ) which predict an extended period of reionization , ranging from @xmath47 to @xmath48 or so .    as we approach the reionization era from the lower redshifts , the ly@xmath11 forest thickens , with an occasional transmission gap due to the intersection of ionized bubbles along the line of sight ; eventually a complete gunn - peterson trough is reached . in other words , the inherent non - uniformity of galaxy and structure formation",
    "is reflected in the structure of the igm phase transition corresponding to the reionization .",
    "further complications arise from the proximity effect due to the source used to probe the igm , i.e. , a luminous quasar , and the nature , luminosity , and duration of other sources near the line of sight .",
    "this general picture is illustrated well in fig .",
    "20 of @xcite ( which is the same as fig .",
    "40 of @xcite , or fig",
    ". 6 of @xcite ) . the qualitative correspondence with the observed spectrum of sdss 10440125 ( fig .",
    "2 ) is striking .",
    "the dramatic increase in the opacity of the ly@xmath11 forest at @xmath1  , i.e. , @xmath49 , is exactly what is expected in the approach to ( or the tail end of ) the reionization era .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , which shows a dramatic thickening of the ly@xmath11 forest absorption at these redshifts .",
    "a slightly different interpretation is that we are seeing a somewhat later evolutionary stage of the reionization process , i.e. , remaining islands of ( mostly ) neutral gas embedded in a growing sea of ionized hydrogen .",
    "the strong observed ly@xmath28 break may also be due in part to the patches of diffuse absorption we see so clearly in ly@xmath11 .",
    "the overall appearance of the spectrum is suggestive of some of the models by @xcite , for the reionization redshift ( in their terminology ) a few percent lower than the source redshift .",
    "the dark portions of our spectrum at @xmath50 have the flux consistent with zero , to within the photon noise .",
    "the lower limit to the optical depth ( r.m.s .",
    ", per pixel ) is @xmath51 ; if we average the flux over the dark portions of the spectrum , this limit is considerably higher , @xmath52 or 7 , depending on the redshift window used .",
    "even if we assume a very conservative systematic sky subtraction error of @xmath53% of the continuum , the implied optical depth limit would be @xmath54 .",
    "the extrapolation of the empirical scaling laws found by @xcite and @xcite to these redshifts suggests @xmath55 .",
    "this again indicates that we are seeing more absorption than would be expected from a simple extrapolation of the ly@xmath11 forest .",
    "the few remaining transmission spikes are naturally interpreted as being due to the as - yet unpercolated reionization bubbles along the line of sight .",
    "an issue arises of whether the damping wings of the remaining neutral hydrogen clouds would suppress such transmission spikes ( cf .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , this depends strongly on the extent of the strmgren spheres produced by the ionized sources , i.e. , their luminosities and lifetimes , akin to the usual quasar proximity effect .",
    "indeed , one expects some clustering of the first luminous sources , which are expected to form at the highest peaks of the density field , due to biasing ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the probably massive host of sdss 10440125 is likely to have some luminous neighbors .",
    "we also checked whether any of the dark regions we see at @xmath50 may be dla systems with associated metallic lines , mainly the c iv doublet .",
    "none were found , as is expected from as yet unenriched gas .    in their discovery paper , @xcite addressed the issue of reionization , and concluded that it is not detected in their data , on the basis of the few remaining transmission spikes .",
    "their were heavily binned spectrum seems roughly comparable to our lris data shown in fig .",
    "1 , from which we can not conclude much ; a higher resolution spectrum , such as our spectrum shown in fig .",
    "2 , is necessary .",
    "furthermore , in their original redshift interpretation ( which was due to the then unknown bal nature of the object ) @xcite may have mistaken the leftover quasar flux around the ly@xmath11 as being a part of the ly@xmath11 forest .",
    "after this paper was submitted , @xcite presented spectroscopy of this and three additional quasars at @xmath56 , discovered by @xcite .",
    "they present a compelling evidence for a gunn - peterson trough in the spectrum of the most distant quasar , suggesting the reionization epoch at @xmath14 , as anticipated here .",
    "this is a crucial result .",
    "however , the discussion of the remaining spectra by @xcite was limited by the available data , with relatively short exposure times . in order to increase the apparent s / n ratio , they binned the spectra by a factor of @xmath57 in wavelength , from @xmath58   pixel@xmath16 to 4   pixel@xmath16 .",
    "the resulting loss of resolution makes it hard to detect dark windows similar to those seen in our esi spectrum , especially given the differences in the s / n ratio .",
    "they further evaluated the mean optical depth in very wide bins , with @xmath59 , which clearly precludes the detection of any dark windows with a smaller extent in redshift .",
    "given these differences in the data and the analysis , we see no inconsistencies with our results .    taken together , the data so far suggest an extended and patchy end to the reionization era , as expected from modern models of structure formation and of the reionization itself .",
    "probing along more lines of sight with a high - s /",
    "n , high - resolution spectroscopy is necessary in order to place more quantitative observational constraints .",
    "further insights will be obtained from direct detections of luminous sources responsible for the reionization at these and higher redshifts , their luminosity function and clustering properties .",
    "we want to thank the staff of the w.  m.  keck observatory for their expert assistance .",
    "the lris data were obtained in the course of a collaborative project with f. harrison and p. mao .",
    "we thank numerous colleagues whose constructive comments helped us improve the discussion presented in the paper .",
