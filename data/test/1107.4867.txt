    "the seventh - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data rigorously test the standard cosmological model placing constraints on its basic parameters .",
    "the wmap measurements alone are not enough to break the degeneracy among some cosmological parameters or to place constraints on non - standard cosmological models .",
    "for example , measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum alone do not strongly constrain the curvature of the universe characterized by the energy density parameter @xmath0 .",
    "one needs to complement the cmb data with the luminosity or angular diameter distances measurements in order to constrain @xmath0 because the astrophysical distances depend also on the expansion history of the universe @xcite .",
    "there are conclusive evidences that the universe is in a state of accelerated expansion .",
    "the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sneia , @xcite ) , combined with cmb anisotropy measurements ( @xcite ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from the galaxy distribution data ( @xcite ) , and galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements ( @xcite ) support the idea that we live in a spatially - flat universe where nonrelativistic matter make almost 30% of the critical energy density while the rest is an unknown component called dark energy , with negative effective pressure being responsible for the present phase of accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "constrains on dark energy density parameter @xmath1 and on its equation of state @xmath2 ( the ratio of pressure to energy density ) , can explain the nature of the repulsive force causing the acceleration of the universe .",
    "one possible explanation for this unknown component is an energy density constant in time and uniform in space .",
    "such a cosmological constant ( @xmath3 ) was originally postulated by einstein to explain a static universe , later rejected when the expansion of the universe was first detected and presently reinstated to account for the dark energy .",
    "still , the computed value of @xmath3 is expected to be @xmath4 larger than the observed one .",
    "another cosmological scenario considers that dark energy is a dynamical scalar field with a time varying equation of state .",
    "an alternative explanation of the accelerating expansion of the universe is that general relativity or the standard cosmological model is incorrect .",
    "however , ground and space observations can not discriminate among different dark energy scenarios as the correct explanation of the observed accelerating universe : a cosmological constant , a dynamical scalar field or a modification of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the wmap7-year data combined with other astrophysical measurements @xcite place constraints on the dark energy . assuming a flat universe ( @xmath5 ) , an accurate determination of the hubble expansion rate ( @xmath6 ) helps in improving the limit of the equation of state of the dark energy @xcite . in the paper of komatsu et .",
    "@xcite from the joint analysis of wmap7+bao+@xmath6 in the case of a time independent equation of state , a value of @xmath7 at @xmath8 cl was obtained .",
    "furthermore , adding high - z supernova data to their analysis a more stringent limit was obtained , @xmath9 at @xmath8 cl",
    ". however , this later result does not take into account the systematic errors in supernovae , which are comparable with the statistical errors @xcite . also , combining the cluster abundance and 5-year wmap data , vikhlinin et al .",
    "@xcite found that for a flat universe @xmath10 at @xmath8 cl .",
    "furthermore , adding bao @xcite and the supernova data @xcite , they found @xmath11 at @xmath8 cl .    in this paper , we perform a joint analysis of the cmb - wmap7 data , constraints on hubble expansion rate inferred from the age of astrophysical objects using lookback time method ( lbt ) and measurements of the gas mass fraction of relaxed clusters from chandra x - ray observatory(chandra ) .",
    "our aim is to investigate for several parameters of a given cosmological model which combination of this three data sets puts better constrains .",
    "we choose the lookback time method because it has the advantage of using the ages of distant objects which are independent of each other so we can avoid biases present in techniques that use distances of primary or secondary indicators in the cosmic distance ladder method @xcite .",
    "moreover , we use chandra measurements because they currently provides one of the best constraints on @xmath12 and have the advantage of being remarkably simple and robust in terms of its underlying assumptions @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we briefly present the lookback time method , in section 3 chandra gas fraction experiment , in section 4 we describe the statistical analysis and present the data sets and finally , in the last sections , the results and conclusions .",
    "this time - based method uses ages of astrophysical objects ( passively evolving galaxies or clusters of galaxies ) which are independent of each other , to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it avoids biases that are present in cosmic distance ladder method , offering an independent way to cross - check cosmological constraints obtained by using other methods @xcite .",
    "the lookback time is defined as the difference between the present age of the universe ( @xmath13 ) and its age at redshift @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the hubble expansion rate at redshift @xmath14 .",
    "we use the spatially - flat cosmological standard model xcdm , x denoting the fact that the dark energy component has an time independent unknown equation of state . in this model , the hubble expansion rate as a function of redshift can be written as : @xmath18^{1/2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the matter energy density parameter and @xmath2 is the equation of state for the dark energy .",
    "the observed lookback time @xmath20 ( see the diagram presented in fig .",

    "the lookback time method has the important feature that the age of distant objects are independent of each other and we can avoid biases present in techniques that use distances of primary or secondary indicators in the cosmic distance ladder method @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the gas fraction(fgas ) in x - ray luminous , dynamically relaxed clusters measured with the chandra x - ray observatory , helps in better constraining the cosmological parameters@xcite . following @xcite , the matter content of the largest clusters of galaxies provides an almost fair sample of the total matter of the universe .",
    "measurements of the ratio of baryonic and total mass in clusters of galaxies should closely match the ratio of @xmath30 and @xmath19 .",
    "the matter energy density parameter @xmath19 can be determined by combining measurements of the baryonic mass fraction in the largest galaxy clusters with accurate determinations of @xmath31 from cosmic nucleosynthesis and cmb experiments , and a reliable measurement of the hubble constant , @xmath6 .",

    "the systematic uncertainties in the chandra experiment are parameterized by the angular correction a , the non - thermal pressure support in the clusters @xmath37 , the baryonic mass fraction in stars @xmath38 , the bias factor @xmath39 and an overall calibration parameter k for the residual uncertainty in the accuracy of the instrument calibration and x - ray modeling .",

    "this is different from the approach described in @xcite , where either gaussian or linear uncertainties are taken into consideration and after that , the seven parameters are added to the original list of 13 possible free parameters . in this manner , we manage to decrease the computational costs , especially when trying to constrain non - standard models using also the chandra data .",

    "in order to see , for several parameters of the chosen cosmological model xcdm , which data provides better constrains we run the modified cosmomc package on a parallel computing system by using 64 independent chains for the following combinations of data sets : wmap7 , wmap7+lbt , wmap7+chandra and wmap7+lbt+chandra . we impose for each case the gelman & rubin convergence criterion @xcite .",
