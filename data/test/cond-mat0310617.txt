    "within the last decade an increasing interest in molecular electronics has developed , with the expectation of realising molecular diodes and transistors .",
    "this is based on the progress in manipulation techniques , which now allow the controlled attachment of atomic scale structures like molecules to mesoscopic leads . with these new devices",
    "one is able to determine the conductance properties of molecular structures . explaining and predicting the electronic behaviour of such devices is an essential step towards their design and use as nano - scale electronic circuits .    to this end a number of theoretical studies have been performed with the aim of reproducing measured @xmath0 characteristics .",
    "these studies differ in the way they take the electronic levels of the molecules , their modification by the coupling to the leads and the change of electrostatic potential due to bias into account .",
    "semi - empiric methods@xcite have been used , as well as first principles techniques,@xcite the latter being restricted to systems of moderate size .",
    "the wide range of experimentally observed behaviour ( see section [ sec : experiment ] ) suggests , that not only the structure of the molecule , but also the details of the device fabrication affect the conduction properties of molecular devices .",
    "the crucial step is the deposition of molecules onto the surface of the lead .",
    "as this is achieved by self - assembly the amount of adsorbed molecules and their individual positions can not be exactly controlled and therefore remains unknown .",
    "a satisfactory understanding of the interplay between geometrical alignment of the molecules and measured conductance properties has thus not yet been achieved ( for a recent review see e.g.  nitzan et al.@xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the way in which changing the geometrical alignment of the mono - layer has an influence on the conduction properties of a molecular device . in",
    "so doing we can rule out a number of explanations which have previously been considered@xcite to explain the occurrence of additional structure in the conductance - voltage ( @xmath1 ) characteristics .",
    "the outline is the following : first we summarise some of the recent experimental findings .",
    "then the method we use ( based on esqc@xcite ) for calculating the conductance properties of molecular devices , is discussed .",
    "calculations for the conductance of a sam , being build of 1,4-phenylene diisocyanide ( pdi ) and sandwiched between gold leads are then presented .",
    "the results for three qualitatively different geometrical constitutions of the mono - layer are compared with experimental data . by this",
    "we can rule out all but one and conclude that the only geometrical alignment , which gives rise to several peaks in the conductance curve , is a mono - layer with additional molecules perturbing the periodicity .",
    "the devices built to study conductance properties of molecular structures differ not only in amount and chemical structure of the molecules in use but also in the way these are attached to metallic or semi - conducting leads",
    ". single or few molecules are accessible in mechanically controllable break junctions ( mcb ) and with the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "many molecules are involved in sandwiched self - assembled mono - layer ( sam ) experiments .",
    "the observed properties depend on the exact geometry of the device .",
    "the conductance differs in orders of magnitude and the qualitative voltage dependency of the current ranges from simple ohmic behaviour to negative differential resistance ( ndr).@xcite    in the past reed et al.@xcite have measured the electrical conductance of a self - assembled molecular mono - layer bridging an mcb at room temperature .",
    "molecules of 1,4-benzene dithiol ( i.e.  having two thiol end - groups , which are known to couple strongly to au - atoms ) were used and the @xmath1 characteristic was found to be symmetric with one peak in the voltage range of @xmath2v . they measured a current of the order of @xmath3na at a bias voltage of @xmath4v , which they claim is produced by transport through one single active molecule .",
    "reichert et al.@xcite also used an mcb with molecules having two thiol end groups , but being considerably longer .",
    "the measured current amplitude was about @xmath5na at @xmath6v , i.e.  although the molecule was more than twice as long , the current was ten times larger .    with a different setup , where a sam is sandwiched between two metallic leads ,",
    "chen et al.@xcite have found negative differential resistance ( ndr ) , namely one peak at @xmath4v in the @xmath0 curve .",
    "the molecule under investigation had one thiol end - group only and was attached to au - leads at both ends .",
    "the measurements were taken at room temperature and the measured current maximum was of the order of @xmath6na .",
    "only recently , sandwiched sam devices at @xmath7k were studied,@xcite where a benzene ring with two cyanide instead of thiol end - groups was used .",
    "the measurements exhibited currents of the order of @xmath8na .",
    "the @xmath1 characteristic for this molecule revealed more structure , in form of three to five peaks within a voltage range of @xmath6v .",
    "such a behaviour was not observed with previous devices containing other molecules .",
    "in the literature there has been presented quite a number of techniques to calculate non - equilibrium electronic transport through molecular systems attached to mesoscopic leads .",
    "usually the landauer formalism is applied , which describes current as elastic electron transmission and therefore requires the transmission function @xmath9 . to this end",
    "one needs a framework that allows for a description of the molecular device on the atomic level .",
    "this involves not only the molecules themselves , but also the surface and bulk region of the leads .",
    "quantum chemistry provides such a framework , and one can choose the level of theory according to the size of the system under consideration and the computational effort one is willing to spend .    using a quantum chemistry method , the transmission function can be obtained from an effective one - particle hamiltonian , which is an appropriate description for strong coupling of the molecules to the leads ( as in the case of covalent binding ) .",
    "the methods differ in the generation of the one - particle hamiltonian , which might be based on semi - empirical grounds @xcite or on first - principles and self - consistent techniques .",
    "@xcite    a different approach,@xcite taking many - particle effects explicitly into account , uses a master equation with transition rates calculated perturbatively using the golden rule .",
    "this approach is appropriate for weak coupling .",
    "we use the landauer formalism , as the molecules are assumed to be chemically bonded to the gold contacts ( i.e.  strong coupling ) , together with the semi - empiric extended hckel quantum - chemistry method esqc.@xcite the molecular structure is optimised@xcite beforehand .",
    "this approach , though limited as compared to more sophisticated quantum chemistry methods , is yet justified , because we want to gain a qualitative understanding of a many molecule experiment , which can not be described by first - principle techniques , as the number of atoms involved is beyond the practical limitations of to - date computer resources .      according to the landauer formula , current along a defect region is the result of electron transmission from the source to the drain lead .",
    "this is described by the transmission function @xmath9 and net electron transfer happens at all those energies , where there are more states occupied in the source lead than in the drain .",
    "the difference in occupation is a result of the applied bias @xmath10 , which raises the chemical potential @xmath11 of the source lead above the one of the drain lead @xmath12 and thus changes the distribution function @xmath13 . @xmath14",
    "the landauer formula is valid under the condition that transport is coherent across the molecule , which is plausible as the typical mean - free path of electrons within metals is of the order of @xmath5 nm , while the molecular gap between source and drain lead is only about @xmath15 nm in length .",
    "furthermore it is assumed that the coupling of the leads to macroscopic reservoirs is reflection - less , and that the tunneling electrons equilibrate only deep inside the leads .",
    "this ensures that the distribution function for incoming electrons in a lead can be taken to be spatially constant , even close to the molecular region .",

[",

    ", the infinite - dimensional hamiltonian of the entire system can be composed of quantum chemical one - particle block hamiltonians of finite dimension : @xmath20 the first summation describes the isolated molecular region , by an on - site energy @xmath21 and a hopping term . the indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 run over the orbital basis set within that region .",
    "the next two summations describe the isolated leads , labelled by @xmath24 .",

    "note that only the first layer @xmath25 contributes to that term and that there is no interaction between different leads .",
    "these are only formal restrictions , as parts of each lead can be included into the molecular region .",
    "the determination of the transmission function involves two steps .",
    "first the conduction properties of the isolated leads have to be calculated .",
    "thereby each lead will be decomposed into conducting and non - conducting in- and out - going channels .",
    "these correspond to propagating and evanescent solutions moving in one of two possible directions respectively . in a second step",
    ", the channels are connected to each other via the molecular region .",
    "this is described by the scattering matrix and the transmission function is finally obtained by summing up the contribution from each channel .",
    "the calculation can be performed either using green s function techniques@xcite or equivalently@xcite using esqc@xcite , which is a scattering - matrix approach .",
    "we present the details of the calculation in the second scheme , as individual contributions from each channel to the transmission function can then be easily studied .",
    "first we will restrict our attention to the semi - infinite lead hamiltonians , which do not have to be identical .",
    "the hamiltonians of equation for one lead @xmath26 are layer independent , if one assumes periodicity , i.e.  @xmath27 and @xmath28 . using bloch s theorem",
    "one can reduce the infinite dimensional system of equations to an @xmath29-matrix equation ( @xmath30 being the number of orbital basis functions in one layer ) @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the overlap matrix between orbitals in layer @xmath35 and layer @xmath36 for cases when one does not deal with an orthonormal basis set ( otherwise @xmath37 ) .",

    "this layer - to - layer propagator @xmath42 reduces the problem of finding solutions for the entire isolated lead hamiltonian to specifying the wave function coefficients at two adjacent layers @xmath43 and @xmath44 only .",
    "this is due to the fact that given these coefficients any other pair of coefficients @xmath45 can now be obtained via : @xmath46 all possible solutions at energy @xmath47 can be decomposed into independent channels , by solving for the eigenvalues of equation .",
    "these eigenvalues come in pairs such that for each eigenvalue @xmath48 , there exists a corresponding eigenvalue @xmath49 satisfying the relation @xmath50 , as can be seen by transposing equation .",
    "eigenvalues with @xmath51 , i.e.  complex @xmath52 , belong to exponentially diverging solutions ( see equation ) .",
    "these are of course non physical , as long as the lead is infinite . in semi - infinite leads",
    "however ( which we are dealing with ) , exponentially decaying coefficients at the boundary will contribute to the surface wave function and must not be neglected .",
    "the contribution from a single channel to the net current can not directly be seen from equation .",
    "it depends on the current density associated with a solution to the schrdinger equation @xmath53 and is obtained via the continuity equation .",

    "this is opposed to the transfer matrix @xmath95 , which determines the amplitudes of in- and outgoing waves @xmath96 in one lead given the in- and outgoing waves @xmath97 of a second lead : @xmath98 this matrix is quadratic only if both leads have the same number of channels .",

    "therefore one commonly takes source and drain lead to be identically constituted .",
    "but even in such cases , the method becomes numerically unstable , with increasing distance between the molecular region and one lead .",
    "this is because the matrix elements of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( in equation ) diverge exponentially , with increasing lead separation .",

    "the transmission function is the sum over the contributions from each combination of incoming channel in the source lead to outgoing channel in the drain lead : @xmath103 .",

    "low temperature experiments with pdi sam s sandwiched between two metallic leads show several peaks in the @xmath1-diagram.@xcite the typical voltage differences of these peaks are in the range of @xmath112 ( i.e.  there are about 5 peaks within @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "the commonly adopted explanation for the occurrence of such peaks is the following .",
    "each molecular orbital that enters the energy window , which is opened by the applied voltage , enables resonant tunneling .",
    "this increases the conductance and therefore results in a peak within the @xmath1-diagram .    typically , the energy gap between molecular orbitals is in the range of @xmath115 . in other words ,",
    "for applied voltages up to @xmath114 there should be only a single accessible orbital per molecule , giving rise to only a single peak in the @xmath1-diagram . therefore the following question arises : are there geometrical alignments of the molecules such that the additional peaks in the @xmath1 diagram can also be explained by resonant tunneling through molecular orbitals ?      during the device fabrication , the step under least experimental control is the adsorption of the molecules onto the leads .",
    "therefore the exact geometrical alignment of the molecular sam and , at least in the sandwich geometry , also the atomic shape of the top metallic lead , is not exactly known .",
    "one therefore has to expect not only one specific but rather quite a variety of molecular alignments to be produced .",
    "as one is interested in the conduction properties of the resulting device , it is important to understand the influence of each type of geometrical alignment to the transmission function .    to this end , we have investigated three such possible alignments , which will be discussed separately .    1 .   by adding metal - atoms on top of the molecular mono - layer in a random way",
    ", there might occur metallic clusters on top of the mono - layer .",
    "these affect the electronic configuration of the molecules individually , and might therefore have an influence to the transmission function . 2 .   in a sam experiment",
    ", there is not just one molecule , but rather a few hundred molecules involved .",
    "if the contribution to the transmission function was different for each molecule , then @xmath9 would change qualitatively , with a change in size of the mono - layer .",
    "we therefore analyse how the transmission functions depends on the number of molecules involved .",
    "3 .   if the molecular mono - layer is not strictly periodic , then there will be defects .",
    "for example can the distance between two molecules be reduced , such that inter - molecular bonds can be build .",
    "each of these defects will have a specific electronic structure and will therefore influence the transmission function .      in the sandwich geometry ,",
    "first the bottom metallic lead is created .",
    "then the molecular mono - layer is adsorbed on top of it by self - assembly .",
    "finally the top metallic lead is build upon the molecular mono - layer .",
    "the exact shape of neither metallic surface is known and may be anything but flat and regular .    it is likely that the surface atoms of the top metallic lead build up clusters on top of the molecular layer ( as for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleandcluster ] b ) . which influence do they have on the electronic configuration of the molecule they are in contact with ? and do the clusters act as small molecules with new electronic levels ?",
    "the influence of an au cluster on the molecular electronic structure is twofold .",
    "first it introduces new electronic levels , and second the existing molecular electronic levels will be shifted , by an amount which depends on the strength of the coupling between cluster and molecule .",
    "the latter effect will be observed as a shifted peak in the transmission function , only if the coupling between cluster and molecule is different to the coupling between top electrode and molecule . for clusters similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleandcluster ] ( b ) , this is however not the case .",
    "the energetic peak positions are identical , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleandcluster ] ( c ) .    furthermore , there are no additional peaks , which one might have expected because of the additional electronic levels of the cluster .",
    "the explanation of their absence is the following : an electronic level gives rise to a peak in the transmission function only , if the corresponding orbital wave function overlaps with both the top and bottom electrode .",
    "the overlap with the electrode the cluster is attached to ( say top electrode ) is of course large .",
    "the overlap with the bottom electrode consists of two parts . the direct overlap and the indirect overlap via the molecule .",
    "the direct overlap is negligible due to the large spatial separation .",
    "the indirect overlap depends on the molecular orbital wave function .",
    "if the energy of the cluster level does not coincide with a molecular energy level , then there is no indirect overlap . only if two levels coincide , the indirect coupling is large , but in that case , there already exists a transmission peak due to the molecule itself .",

    "compared to the experiments@xcite the number of steps in the @xmath0curve is well reproduced by our calculation .",
    "the obtained current is at least one order of magnitude larger than the experimental values.@xcite this is a phenomenon common to all theoretical methods based on the landauer formula.@xcite a satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy as well as for the broad range of experimentally observed current values has not yet been found .",

    "there are three distinct steps within the voltage range of 1v . ]",
    "we have shown , that the peak structure of the transmission function is robust against changes in the number of adsorbed molecules , as long as the distance between molecules is considerably large ( @xmath143 ) . and also does the exact shape of the top metallic lead not influence the qualitative structure of the transmission function . only if the distance between molecules becomes so small , that inter - molecular interactions are no longer negligible ( which is below 6  in our case ) ,",
    "does the transmission function undergo a qualitative change .",
    "namely an additional peak structure occurs .",
    "how does this finding compare to the experimental data ? as we have pointed out in section [ sec : experiment ] , only in devices using molecules with two cyanide end - groups a more or less random peak structure was observed in the @xmath1 characteristic@xcite . in other devices , molecules with at least one thiol end - group are typically used .",
    "these show significantly less peak structure .",
    "we therefore give the following interpretation : the thiol end - group is known to bind strongly to au atoms .",
    "it is therefore likely , that thiol - based mono - layers stably adsorb to gold leads .",
    "resulting periodic structures are then robust against distortions .",
    "the conductance of such structures is proportional to the corresponding single molecule conductance , i.e.  the number of molecules involved changes the absolute value of the current only , not the peak structure .",
    "the random like peak structure in devices , made up of cyanide based molecules suggests , that there are a some molecular clusters present in the mono - layer .",
    "these clusters might occur , because the binding of a cyanide end - group to au is considerably weaker compared to that of a thiol end - group , and weaker binding results in a less robust periodic structure .",
    "we would like to thank xavier bouju , as well as udo beierlein for helpful discussions .",
    "the current properties of each channel can be related to the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "we start from equation : @xmath144 let s first consider @xmath145 , i.e.  @xmath146 , i.e.  @xmath147 . for each channel with eigenvalue @xmath148 one then must have @xmath149 , i.e.   this channel does not itself carry any current .",
    "this is consistent with our terminology of an evanescent wave . if , however , @xmath150 , then @xmath151 is purely imaginary , because @xmath152 is an anti - hermitian operator .",
    "we can therefore define the velocity of a propagating wave to be @xmath153 .",
    "now we consider the case of two different solutions @xmath154 and define @xmath155 . if their eigenvalues do not satisfy @xmath156 , then the current between these two solutions is zero @xmath157 .",
    "so let s assume @xmath158 . because if @xmath159 then @xmath160 , a current can flow between an evanescent left going wave and an evanescent right going wave .",
    "but if we restrict ourselves to solutions with finite amplitudes in a semi - infinite lead , then either the left or right going wave amplitude must be zero .",
    "therefore evanescent waves do neither carry a current themselves nor do they exchange current with other channels , that is they do not at all contribute to the net current .",
    "finally we are left with the case @xmath161 , with @xmath162 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath163 , i.e.  the case of degenerate eigenvalues . therefore propagating waves to degenerate eigenvalues",
    "do exchange current .",
    "that in turn means , that the current of a superposition of two such waves does not necessarily equal the sum of the two individual currents , which is problematic as we want to express the total current as a sum of independent channels .",
    "however , the propagating and evanescent waves were obtained by diagonalising the propagator @xmath42 .",
    "this transformation is unique up to rotations in every degenerate eigenvalue subspace . because @xmath73 is anti - hermitian we can diagonalise these subspaces and the resulting diagonal elements",
    "will be purely imaginary .",
    "so the net current may be written as a summation over all the individual contributions of propagating channels , only if these subspace rotations are performed .",
    "summarising we have shown that the transformation @xmath84 diagonalising the propagator @xmath42 ( i.e  @xmath164 ) can be chosen such that the transformation @xmath165 of the current operator is diagonal in the subspace of propagating waves with purely imaginary diagonal elements .",
    "all the other diagonal entries are zero and the only non - zero non - diagonal elements belong to evanescent waves in opposite directions .",
    "the part of the hamiltonian containing the molecular region and its coupling to the leads can be written as @xmath166 |\\psi\\rangle = 0.\\ ] ] ( using this order for the coefficients it is straight forward to extend all formulas to the general case of more than two leads . )",
    "the indices 1 and 2 indicate source and drain lead surface layers , while the index 0 is used for the molecular region .",
    "@xmath167 are the coupling matrices from source / drain to the molecules .",
    "we now transform into the basis of incoming and outgoing channels , i.e. we apply @xmath168 ,      \\quad\\text{with }      u^i=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc }          u^i _",
