    "understanding the behavior of low - dimensional electronic systems has been one of the main challenges of experimental and theoretical physics in the last years .",
    "these systems are important not only as the basic building blocks of nanoelectronic devices , but also for the intricate strongly - correlated phenomena they exhibit .",
    "an important subclass is that of metallic ( gapless ) one - dimensional systems , whose low energy dynamics is governed not by fermi liquid theory , but instead by the luttinger liquid ( ll ) paradigm @xcite .",
    "this description applies to a wide variety of experimental realizations , including narrow quantum wires in semiconducting heterostructures , metallic nanowires , and carbon nanotubes .",
    "closely related are chiral lls , formed at the edges of fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) systems @xcite , and helical lls , the edges of spin quantum hall insulators @xcite .",
    "the effect of impurities on these systems is interesting from both the applicative and fundamental points of view .",
    "these impurities could also be intentionally introduced , in the form of , e.g. , quantum dots and anti - dots .",
    "hence , there is no wonder that such questions have attracted much effort recently .",
    "however , most of these studies were restricted to investigation of transport phenomena @xcite , while other effects received much less attention @xcite .",
    "in this work we study probably the most basic example of such a system , namely , a single level in the vicinity of a fractional quantum hall edge , or , equivalently @xcite , a level attached to the end of a single ll wire @xcite",
    ". we will refer to the two components ( in both systems ) as `` dot '' and `` lead '' respectively .",
    "we include in our treatment the effects of short range dot - lead interaction , as well as the influence of an ohmic dissipative bath ( e.g. , electromagnetic fluctuations in gate electrodes ) @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have studied the thermodynamic properties of the model ( e.g. , the level population , entropy , and specific heat ) , and found that they are _ universal _ , in the sense that they depend on the various interactions in the model ( intra - lead , dot - lead , and dot - bath ) only through a single parameter , the fermi edge singularity exponent .",
    "thus , thermodynamics can neither be used to identify non - fermi liquid behavior , nor to extract ll parameters . in this work",
    "we proceed to study , both analytically and numerically , the level density of states ( ldos ) , which may be probed by tunneling or absorption spectroscopies .",
    "we find that the ldos is sensitive to ll physics , even though its integral ( times the fermi function ) gives the level occupancy , which is universal in the above sense . as we show below , the ldos features power - law behavior near the fermi energy . for not too strong interactions the exponent in this power - law",
    "is actually determined by ll physics alone , and is independent of the level - lead and level - bath interactions .",
    "this and many other results derived below can not be achieved using perturbative calculations @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model_cg ] we present our model , and apply to it the anderson - yuval coulomb - gas ( cg ) expansion @xcite .",
    "we then proceed to analytic treatment of the ldos in sec .",

    "[ sec : numerics ] . finally , we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 . the first term is the dot hamiltonian @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 the level creation and annihilation operators , respectively , and @xmath4 the level energy .",
    "the second term is the lead hamiltonian .",
    "it can be written in the form @xmath5 ^ 2 dx,\\ ] ] using _ chiral _ bosonic field @xmath6 obeying the commutation relation @xmath7 = i \\pi \\text{sgn}(x - y)$ ] , where @xmath8 is the velocity of excitations @xcite . the level and the lead",
    "are coupled by : @xmath9 the two terms in this equation describe , respectively , dot - lead hopping ( with @xmath10 the tunneling matrix element ) , and local dot - lead interaction whose strength is @xmath11 .",
    "the electronic annihilation operator at the end of the lead can be written as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a majorana operator , @xmath14 is a short distance cutoff ( e.g. , the lattice spacing ) , and @xmath15 is the ll interaction parameter ( @xmath16 for repulsion , @xmath17 for attraction ) . for a fqhe system with filling @xmath18 , @xmath19 for electron tunneling ( i.e. , a dot outside the fqhe bar ) . finally , the level is coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators @xcite ( describing , e.g. , electromagnetic fluctuations in control gates ) , governed by @xmath20 .",
    "the dot - bath coupling can be written as @xmath21 .",
    "we assume ohmic dissipation , i.e. , linear low - frequency behavior of the bath spectral function : @xmath22 .",
    "we examine this model employing the anderson - yuval cg expansion @xcite . in this approach",
    ", any quantity of interest is expanded to all orders in @xmath10 .",
    "this results in a series of correlation functions , which need to be evaluated for vanishing @xmath10.@xcite the level - lead interaction gives rise to a potential at the end of the lead , which alternates between @xmath23 and @xmath24 whenever an electron tunnels in or out of the level .",
    "similarly , the @xmath25th bath oscillators experience a shift in its equilibrium position , proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "we thus have a sequence of fermi edge singularity events @xcite .",
    "the solution of this latter problem enables the calculation of all the terms in the series of correlation functions .",
    "recently @xcite we have studied in this way the partition function @xmath27 of the model , whose derivatives with respect to the parameters of the system ( for example , the level energy @xmath4 and the temperature @xmath28 ) give us the thermodynamic properties ( e.g. , the level population , entropy , and specific heat ) .",
    "we were able to rewrite the series expansion for @xmath27 in the form of a grand canonical partition function of a classical system of particles .",
    "these represent hopping events generated by @xmath10 , and thus reside on the imaginary time axis of the original quantum model , which is a circle with circumference @xmath29 .",
    "each particle is assigned a positive ( negative ) charge if it represents tunneling of an electron from the lead to the dot ( from the dot to the lead ) .",
    "hence , there must be an even number of charges , which have to appear in alternating order of signs .",
    "the position of the @xmath30th particle is @xmath31 , and the sign of the charge of the first particle is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "the partition function then reads : @xmath33 the charges have a fugacity @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the noninteracting level width [ @xmath36 is the corresponding lead local density of states ] , and @xmath37 is a short - time cutoff .",

    "this interaction is similar in form to 2d coulomb interaction , and is the origin of the name `` cg expansion '' .",
    "the charges are two component vectors , where the two components correspond to the effects of the coupling with the lead and the bath , respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath40 , where the squared - magnitude of the charges , to be denoted by @xmath41 , is the fermi edge singularity exponent of the model .",
    "it is defined by behavior of the zero - temperature correlator of @xmath42 with its hermitian conjugate , calculated at @xmath43 .",
    "this correlator decays as @xmath44 for long time @xmath45 . in our system",
    "we have found that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the effective phase shift in the lead due to the dot - lead coupling @xcite .",
    "it is equal to @xmath48 in straightforward bosonization , but is more complicated in general .",
    "it may be extracted from , e.g. , finite - size energy differences , which could be calculated either numerically or analytically ( via the bethe ansatz ) @xcite . the other part of the cg action accounts for the energetic cost of @xmath4 per unit imaginary time for each interval in which the level is populated .",
    "its form is analogous to an electric field applied to the classical system of charges .",
    "a typical configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cg](a ) .",
    "a similar treatment can be given to the ldos , which we shall denote by @xmath49 .",
    "it is equal to the imaginary part of the level retarded green function ( multiplied by @xmath50 ) .",
    "the retarded green function is in turn the result of analytic continuation of the matsubara green function from the upper half of the complex frequency plane @xcite .",
    "the latter green function is defined by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the imaginary time ordering operator .",
    "following the same methods as above , the numerator of this expression can also be given a cg representation .",
    "this cg has the same form as eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : cg_z1])([eqn : cg_z2 ] ) , with two additional charges of sizes @xmath53 , @xmath54 , inserted at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "these charges correspond to the level creation and annihilation operators appearing in the definition of the green function . in the following",
    "we will refer to these as `` d - charges '' , to distinguish them form the other `` @xmath10-charges '' , which originate from the @xmath10 term .",
    "the contribution of each such configuration is to be multiplied by @xmath57 to account for the fermi statistics .",
    "thus , for @xmath58 the full cg expression for the dot green function is :    @xmath59 e^{- s_{cg , d } ( s , \\tau , \\tau^\\prime , \\ { \\tau_i \\ } ) } , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 .",

    "the classical action is given by : @xmath67 - |\\vec{e}_d|^2 v_c ( \\tau-\\tau^\\prime ) + \\\\",
    "\\varepsilon_0 \\left [ \\frac{1-s}{2 t } - \\sum_{i=1}^{2n } s_i \\tau_i + \\tau - \\tau^\\prime \\right],\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where the sign of the @xmath30th @xmath10-charge is @xmath68 .",
    "a typical configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cg](b ) .",
    "similar expressions hold for @xmath69 .",
    "comparing the two cg expansions , the following observation emerges : the cg expansion for the partition function contains only three parameters : @xmath70 , @xmath4 , and @xmath71 , while expansion for the green function depends on @xmath15 too ( through @xmath72 ) .",
    "hence , the different interaction types ( i.e. , interactions in the wire , the dot - wire interaction , and the dot - bath coupling ) affect the partition function through a single parameter , the fermi edge singularity exponent @xmath71 .",
    "thus , thermodynamic measurements can not be used to distinguish between the different interaction types . in other words",
    ", one can construct very different models , whose interactions differ in strength and even in sign , which will have the same thermodynamic properties , provided @xmath70 , @xmath4 , and @xmath71 are indeed the same @xcite . on the other hand , the ldos , which depends _ explicitly _ on @xmath15 , will exhibit different behavior for these different systems . hence",
    ", it can be used to extract the strength of intra - wire interactions , as we show below .",
    "as noted in our earlier work @xcite , the cg obtained here is identical to the original anderson - yuval expansion @xcite for the anisotropic single - channel kondo model @xcite , demonstrating that the models are equivalent @xcite . under this mapping",
    "the level population becomes the magnetization of the kondo spin ( plus one half ) .",
    "hence , @xmath4 is analogous to a local magnetic field .",
    "similarly , @xmath73 is related to @xmath70 , and @xmath74 to @xmath71 .",
    "the cg parameters obey the famous kondo renormalization group ( rg ) equations @xcite , which read , in our notations : @xmath75 thus , the system considered can be in one of two phases , a strong coupling ( antiferromagnetic - kondo like ) phase and a weak coupling ( ferromagnetic - kondo like ) phase .",
    "the transition occurs , for small @xmath70 , at @xmath76 . in the weak - coupling phase",
    "the coulomb charges form tightly - bound pairs .",
    "the level is thus effectively decoupled at low energies , resulting in its population being discontinuous as a function of @xmath4 at zero temperature @xcite . in the strong - coupling phase",
    "free coulomb charges proliferate .",
    "the impurity is well - coupled with the lead , so the level population is analytic in @xmath4 , and could be extracted from the bethe ansatz solution of the kondo problem @xcite . in particular , for small values of @xmath4 one has @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the kondo temperature ( effective level width , reducing to @xmath70 in the noninteracting case ) @xcite .",
    "hence , in this phase the population does not exhibit any nontrivial power - law dependence on @xmath4 or @xmath28 .",
    "the same applies to other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "what are the implications of this on the ldos ?",
    "as we now show , we typically find that at zero temperature we have a power - law behavior @xmath79 in the vicinity of the fermi energy , i.e. , when @xmath80 is much smaller than @xmath81 in the strong - coupling phase , and than the bandwidth @xmath82 in the weak - coupling phase .",
    "the values of @xmath83 in the different regimes are summarized in table  [ tbl : rho_d ] .",
    "it should be noted that when @xmath84 , or when the lead length @xmath85 is finite , such power - law singularity will be smeared and become @xmath86^\\delta$ ] .",
    "we will now consider each phase separately .    .",
    "[ tbl : rho_d ] summary of the analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] . in the vicinity of the fermi energy ( when @xmath80 and @xmath28 are much smaller than @xmath81 in the strong - coupling phase , and than the bandwidth @xmath82 in the weak - coupling phase ) we have @xmath87^\\delta$ ] , with the values of the exponent @xmath83 in the different regimes denoted in the table below .",
    "when two values are given , the smaller one will give the dominant contribution @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     similar considerations apply to the screened d - charges contribution [ fig .",
    "[ fig : cg_gp](a ) ] when @xmath88 .",
    "for @xmath89 and/or @xmath90 , two corrections are due .",
    "the first correction takes into account the factors coming from the interaction between each d - charge and the neighboring @xmath10-charge , which are power - laws in the time domain .",
    "since the d-@xmath10 charges form tightly - bound pairs , we can take the limits of integration over their separation to infinity .",
    "they thus yield factors of @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the gamma function @xcite , and @xmath93 .",
    "the correction is then the ratio between this expression and its value at @xmath94 .",
    "apart from this constant factor , one must compensate for the fact that the inter - pair interaction of these two d-@xmath10 pairs gives the green function a factor which varies as @xmath95 ( since @xmath96 ) , instead of the @xmath97 dependence used in the calculation of @xmath98 .",
    "hence , @xmath99 should be convoluted here with @xmath100 . for @xmath88",
    "the ldos will thus retain the @xmath101 behavior of the strong - coupling phase .    to conclude the discussion of this niba - type approximation , a general expression for the ldos which interpolates between large and small @xmath102 limits @xcite is of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : niba ] ) , but with @xmath103 replaced by @xmath104 all the low - energy results of this section are summarized in table  [ tbl : rho_d ] .",
    "in this section we present the results of numerical calculations , verifying the conclusions of our previous analysis , i.e. , that the ldos at low energies features a power - law behavior with the power determined by ll physics only ( in the strong coupling phase ) , although , as we have shown before @xcite , its integral ( the level population ) is universal , and can not be used to extract ll parameters .    to calculate the ldos we used classical monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations on the cg expansion of dot green function @xcite .",
    "the mc update procedure used is similar to the one employed recently for the closely - related continuous time quantum mc algorithm @xcite . after obtaining the imaginary - time green function",
    "it was fourier - transformed to matsubara frequencies , followed by analytic continuation to real frequencies using the pad approximant technique @xcite .",
    "this yields the retarded green function , whose imaginary part is proportional to the ldos @xcite .",
    "below we present data in the non - perturbative strong - coupling region , which confirms the results of our previous analysis .",
    "actually , in the weak - coupling phase ( which is accessible analytically through the niba - like approximation ) mc simulations are not efficient , since there cg charges are rare and averaging very slow . in this sense ,",
    "our analysis and numerical calculations are complementary .",
    "the results presented in the different panels fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos].the values of @xmath15 , @xmath11 and @xmath105 are varied , in a way which keeps @xmath71 constant at a value of @xmath106 . hence , the occupancies as functions of @xmath4 are the same , as we also verify below ( actually , the cg representation would predict exactly identical occupations ) .",
    "the ldos curves are , however , markedly different : depending on whether @xmath17 , @xmath16 , or @xmath107 , they have a maximum , a minimum , or no special feature near the fermi energy , respectively . in the inset",
    "we demonstrate that in all cases the ldos at the fermi energy exhibits power - law dependence on temperature , @xmath108 , as found in the previous section ( cf .",
    "table  [ tbl : rho_d ] ) .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we will repeat here some of our previous data on the level occupancy @xcite . since the mc simulation is based on the cg , to have an independent check of the universality of the level population we employed the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite algorithm , using block - sizes of up to @xmath109 .",
    "dmrg is also better suited to ground state calculations , and thus complements the necessarily finite - temperature mc in this respect .",
    "the model used is a half - filled tight binding chain with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "it is described by the hamiltonian : @xmath110 % \\\\\\ ] ] where @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) is the electronic creation ( annihilation ) operator at the @xmath30th site of the wire ( @xmath113 , with @xmath114 ) , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 are , respectively , nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude and interaction strength . the low energy physics of this model is known to be governed by ll theory for not too large interactions ( i.e. , @xmath117),@xcite with @xmath118 $ ] and @xmath119 $ ] .",
    "the dot is still governed by the same @xmath120 , and is coupled to the lead through : @xmath121 @xmath122 , @xmath123 are related to the corresponding parameters of the continuum version eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hdl ] ) by @xmath124 , and @xmath125 , @xmath14 being the lattice spacing .",

    "@xcite    the level population is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlevel ] as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "different curves correspond to different values of @xmath71 , as indicated in the legend . on each such curve",
    "there are three types of symbols , denoting dmrg data on three different models : ( i ) @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath127 ) but nonzero @xmath123 ; ( ii ) @xmath128 ( nonzero @xmath116 ) but @xmath129 ; ( iii ) both @xmath116 and @xmath123 are nonzero .",
    "all the models are without coupling to the bath ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath116 and @xmath123 in each model were chosen so as to give the same value of @xmath71 for each curve . for model ( iii )",
    "we used @xmath131 , with sign opposite to that of model ( ii ) .",
    "in all cases we chose @xmath122 to get @xmath132 and used @xmath133 sites . the results clearly show that the occupancy is indeed universal , depending only on @xmath71 , and not on the strengths or signs of the interactions ( @xmath116 and @xmath123 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the widest curve has similar parameters to those used in the mc simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos ] ) .",
    "to summarize , we have studied , both analytically and numerically , the ldos of a level coupled to a ll and to an ohmic bath over the entire parameter space .",
    "we have found that in general it exhibits a power - law dependence at low energies . in large parts of the phase space",
    "this is just the power - law behavior of the tunneling density of states at the end of a ll wire .",

    "it is also affected by level - lead and level - bath interactions . in any case",
