    "entanglement is a defining feature of quantum mechanical systems and leads to correlations between sub - systems of a very non - classical nature .",
    "these in turn lead to fundamentally new interactions and applications in the field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "one of the main requirements for quantum computation , for instance , is the ability to manipulate the state of a quantum mechanical system in a controlled way @xcite .",
    "if each logical qubit is obtained from the states of a single atom one has to be able to prepare _ arbitrary entangled states _ of @xmath0 two - level atoms .",
    "entangled atoms can also be used to improve frequency standards @xcite .",
    "the strange nature of entanglement was first pointed out by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) @xcite .",
    "the deeper mysteries of entanglement were quantified by bell @xcite in his famous _",
    "bell s inequalities_. these raise testable differences between quantum mechanics and _ all _ local realistic theories .",
    "there are a number of bell inequalities for two subsystems where each subsystem contains one qubit of information including the original _ spin _",
    "@xcite , clauser - horne ( ch ) @xcite , clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) @xcite and information theoretic @xcite bell inequalities , to name but a few .",
    "the concept of qubits is thus a useful construct for bell inequality tests , as it is a useful construct for quantum information .",
    "numerous experimental tests of bell - type inequalities have been made using photons starting with aspect @xcite .",
    "violations , showing agreement with quantum mechanics , of over 200 standard deviations @xcite and over large distances @xcite have now been performed .",
    "a lot of progress has been made in closing different loopholes .",
    "very recently , the first experiment testing bell s inequality with _ atoms _ has been performed by rowe _",
    "the main advantage of this experiment is that it is possible to read out the state of the atoms with a very high efficiency following a measurement proposal by cook @xcite based on `` electron shelving '' .",
    "this allows to investigate , characterize and test bell s inequality with a very high precision and to close the detection loophole @xcite .    in this proceedings",
    "we want to point out that tests of bell s inequalities do not _ only _ play an important role in testing basic quantum mechanical principles .",
    "they are also crucial in quantum computing to verify atom entanglement schemes .",
    "the main obstacle in the state manipulation of atoms arises from the fact that a quantum mechanical system is always also coupled to its environment .",
    "this leads to decoherence .",
    "the atoms may emit photons , and the state manipulation failed .",
    "new entanglement schemes have therefore been based on the existence of decoherence - free states @xcite and ideas of how to restrict the time evolution of a system onto the corresponding decoherence - free subspace @xcite .",
    "but during the state preparation no photons are emitted and observing a violation of bell s inequality is the only way to test whether the scheme works with a high precision or not .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss a scheme based on recent results by beige _",
    "@xcite which allow to prepare @xmath0 two - level atoms , each with a state @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in an arbitrary entangled state by using a leaky optical cavity .",
    "section iii discusses a recent proposal to entangle atoms in a photonic band gap .",
    "section iv illustrates different methods to verify highly entangled states for a few atoms .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "in this section we want to give a short overview about a scheme to prepare @xmath0 two - level atoms in an _ arbitrary _ entangled state by using a _ leaky optical cavity _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ cavity ] .",
    "the atoms can be stored in a linear trap , an optical lattice or on a chip for quantum computing @xcite and it is possible to move two of them simultaneously into the cavity .",
    "the coupling constant of each atom inside the cavity to the single field mode is in the following denoted by @xmath3",
    ". the spontaneous decay rate of each atoms equals @xmath4 , while @xmath5 is the decay rate of a single photon inside the cavity .      to explain the main idea of the entanglement scheme we consider first only _ two _ two - level atoms with the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are in resonance with the cavity mode , @xmath6 , and describe the preparation of the entangled state @xmath7 an arbitrary parameter .",
    "to do so the two atoms , initially in the ground state , @xmath8 , have to be moved into the cavity which should be empty .",
    "in addition , a single laser pulse of length @xmath9 , which is in resonance with the atoms , @xmath10 , has to be applied .",
    "this laser couples with a rabi frequency @xmath11 to atom and we define @xmath12    there are two sources of decoherence in the system : spontaneous emission by each atom with rate @xmath4 and leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors with rate @xmath5 .",
    "we assume here that the later one is the main source for dissipation and a strong coupling between the atoms and the cavity mode , i.e. @xmath13 for this parameter regime , one can show that the state of the atoms at the end of the pulse is given by eq .",
    "( [ instate ] ) with @xmath14 to do so we now have a closer look at the time evolution of the system .    to describe the time evolution of the system",
    "we make use of the quantum jump approach @xcite .",
    "it predicts that the ( unnormalized ) state of a quantum mechanical system under the condition of no photon emission equals at time @xmath15 @xmath16 where the conditional hamiltonian @xmath17 is a non - hermitian hamiltonian . for the total system consisting of the two atoms and the cavity mode it is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the annihilation operator for a single photon in the cavity mode . as a consequence of the non - hermitian terms in eq .",
    "( [ hcondl ] ) , the norm of the state vector @xmath20 decreases with time and its squared norm at time @xmath15 gives the probability for no photon emission in @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath22 for the parameter choice ( [ par ] ) we can show that this probability is very close to unity , which is why we have to consider only the no - photon time evolution of the system .",
    "because of eq .",
    "( [ par ] ) , there are two very different time scales in the system .",
    "one can therefore solve the conditional time evolution of the system with the help of an adiabatic elimination of the fast varying states .",
    "this has been done in ref .",
    "alternatively one can solve eq .",
    "( [ phit ] ) numerically .",
    "here we only present numerical results .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the probability for no photon emission obtained from a numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ phit ] ) . as an example",
    "we choose the preparation of the maximally entangled state @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "if a photon is emitted in @xmath25 the preparation failed and has to be repeated . nevertheless , as fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows , the success rate of the scheme is very close to unity .",
    "the fidelity of the state @xmath26 in case of a successful preparation is found to be always higher than @xmath27 for the parameters chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "the main limiting factor of the scheme is spontaneous emission by the atoms with rate @xmath4 . to suppress",
    "this one can make use of an additional atomic level 2 . as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , this level should form together with the levels 0 and 1 a @xmath28 configuration . choosing the parameters as in ref .",
    "@xcite , level 2 can be eliminated adiabatically , which leads to atomic two - level systems as described above .",
    "but now the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 are stable ground states and do not decay .",
    "we now want to give a more intuitive explanation why the scheme works .",
    "it takes advantage of the fact that two - level atoms inside the cavity possess _ decoherence - free _ states @xcite .",
    "decoherence - free states arise if no interaction between the system and its environment of free radiation fields takes place .",
    "if we neglect spontaneous emissions this is exactly the case if the cavity mode is empty @xcite .",
    "in addition , the systems own time evolution due to the interaction between the atoms and the cavity mode should not lead to the population of non decoherence - free states . from this condition we find that the decoherence - free states are the superpositions of the two atomic states @xmath29 and @xmath23 while the cavity mode is empty .",
    "( [ instate ] ) corresponds therefore to the decoherence - free states of the system .",
    "how the preparation scheme works can now easily be understood in terms of an _ environment induced quantum zeno effect _ @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath30 as the time in which a photon leaks out through the cavity mirrors with a probability very close to unity if the system is initially prepared in a state with no overlap with a decoherence - free state .",
    "on the other hand , a system in a decoherence - free state will definitely not emit a photon in @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the observation of the free radiation field over a time interval @xmath30 can be interpreted as a measurement of whether the system is decoherence - free or not @xcite .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is indicated by an emission or no emission of a photon . as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath30 is of the order @xmath31 and @xmath32 and much smaller than the typical time scale for the laser interaction .    here the system continuously interacts with its environment and the system behaves like a system under continuous observation .",
    "therefore , the quantum zeno effect predicts that all transitions to non decoherence - free states are strongly inhibited .",
    "nevertheless , there is no inhibition of transitions between decoherence - free states and the effect of the laser field on the atomic states can be described by the _ effective _ hamiltonian @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the projector on the decoherence - free subspace . if we neglect spontaneous emission eq .",
    "( [ hcondl ] ) leads to latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }   \\label{heff2 } h_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm ( atoms ) } & = & { \\hbar \\omega^{(- ) } \\over 2 } \\ ,    remains empty . by solving the corresponding time evolution",
    ", one finds that a laser pulse of length @xmath9 prepares the atoms indeed in state ( [ instate ] ) with @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) . varying the length of the laser pulse allows to change arbitrarily the amount of entanglement of the prepared state .",
    "the entanglement scheme described in the previous subsection allows only for the preparation of certain entangled states of two atoms @xcite . for many applications ,",
    "however , one has to be able to prepare arbitrary entangled states of @xmath0 two - level atoms with @xmath37 . in this subsection",
    "we show how this can be done by generalizing the scheme described above .",
    "one possibility to increase the number of decoherence - free states in the system is to move @xmath0 two - level atoms simultaneously into the cavity .",
    "this has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the decoherence - free states of this system have been constructed explicitly",
    ". however , for applications like quantum computing it is crucial to have simple qubits . _ ideally , the logical qubits should be the same as the physical qubits .",

    "note , that the system is , in principle , scalable .",
    "arbitrary many atoms can be used .    to prove that it is possible to prepare arbitrary states of the atoms we only have to show that it is possible to perform universal quantum gates between all qubits @xcite .",

    ", the atom has to be moved out of the cavity .",
    "then two lasers , both with the same detuning , are applied simultaneously .",
    "one couples to the 1 - 2 transition and the other two the 0 - 1 transition , both with the same rabi frequencies .",

    "in this section we give a short overview over another recent scheme by angelakis _",
    "@xcite to prepare two atoms in an entangled state using a photonic crystal ( or photonic band gap material - pg ) .",
    "the experimental setup of this scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ figx ] and the entanglement between the atoms originates from the interaction of two atoms with a resonant defect mode .    the first atom is prepared in the upper of two optically separated states , denoted in the following by @xmath54 and propagates into the transition in the pbg .",
    "this atom is unable to emit a photon @xcite due to the exclusion of electromagnetic modes over a continuous range of frequencies @xcite and hence a long lived photon - atom bound state of the form @xcite @xmath55 is formed , where @xmath56 is the interaction time of atom 1 with the defect and @xmath57 the ground state of the atom .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be derived using a jaynes - cummings hamiltonian .",
    "as soon as atom 1 leaves the defect region , a second atom , atom 2 , prepared in its ground state @xmath60 is send through . if @xmath61 is the interaction time of this atom with the defect , then the final state of the system is of the form @xmath62 with an appropriate choice of @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) one can achieve that the prepared states equals @xmath65 which is a maximally entangled state of the two atoms .",
    "one of the main problems with entanglement schemes using the no - photon time evolution of a system is , that someone who performs the experiment can not know for sure whether the scheme worked or not .",
    "measuring whether no photon has been emitted during the whole experiment would require perfect photon detectors which cover all solid angels .",
    "it is therefore crucial to have other tests whether a preparation schemes succeeds or not .",
    "what one can do is to use the scheme to prepare a certain maximally entangled state of the atoms and to verify it by observing a violation of a bell inequality . in this section",
    "we describe how to observe a violation of a bell s inequality for _ two _ atoms and mermin s ghz inequality @xcite for _ multiple _ atoms .",
    "it is important to note that for each pure two qubit state , there exists always a bell inequality which can be violated .",
    "to do so one has to be able to measure whether an atom is in state @xmath66 or @xmath67 with a very high precision .",
    "this can be done following a proposal by cook @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of this measurement scheme can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "given that the state ( [ instate ] ) can be generated , the next interesting question is whether it violates one of bell s inequalities ?",
    "for certain parameters it must but what physical measurements are necessary ?",

    "if we choose @xmath84 and @xmath85 the inequality ( [ spinx ] ) simplifies to @xmath86 and a violation of this inequality corresponds to @xmath87 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the correlation function for the entangled state ( [ instate ] ) is given by @xmath88 and hence eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) can assume a maximum of @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , a violation of the _ spin _ bell inequality is possible for @xmath91 given our analyzer choices .",
    "how @xmath92 can be expressed in terms of the system parameter @xmath93 is shown in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) . in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) we plot @xmath94 versus @xmath93 and @xmath95 .    a significant region of violation is observed with the maximum of @xmath96 occurring at @xmath97 .",
    "the state of the atoms at such a time is a maximally entangled state @xmath23 .",
    "this test on bell s inequality can therefore be used to verify the preparation of this state with a high precision and should be feasible with current technology .",
    "so far , we have discussed how our preparation method can be tested for two atoms .",
    "a similar procedure can be used for multiple atoms depending on the state prepared .",
    "for instance in the case of three atoms we could prepare a state of the form @xmath98 this state is known as the ghz state @xcite . to characterize it we now use mermin ghz inequality @xcite instead of a bell inequality .",
    "this inequality has the form @xmath99 for the state ( [ spintriplet ] ) we can calculate the moments @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 using a similar procedure to that discussed in the bell test .",
    "we find that @xmath104 for the state ( [ spintriplet ] ) while the maximum according to local realism is @xmath105 .",
    "for entangled states of more atoms ( @xmath106 ) a generalized form of mermin s inequality can be employed .",
    "in this proceeding we used the recent results of refs .",
    "@xcite and described a scheme to prepare arbitrary entangled states of @xmath0 atoms in a controlled way with a very high success rate .",
    "the scheme is based on the existence of decoherence - free states and an environment induced quantum zeno effect to avoid the population of non decoherence - free states during the preparation .",
