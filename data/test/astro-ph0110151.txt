    "although there are many examples of variable radio sources discovered as a result of high - energy observations , there are surprisingly few radio surveys for highly variable or transient sources .",
    "a radio survey of the galactic plane by gregory & taylor  ( 1981 , 1986 ) discovered 4 variable sources including gt  0236@xmath1610 , a galactic x - ray binary , and 1 candidate transient .",

    "the galactic center ( gc ) is a promising region in which to search for highly variable and transient sources .",
    "the stellar densities are high , and neutron star- and black hole binaries appear as ( transient or variable ) x - ray sources concentrated toward the gc ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous surveys have been ill - suited for detecting radio transients toward the gc , however .",
    "typically , they have utilized either single dish instruments , which suffer from confusion in the inner galaxy , or they have utilized the vla for only a single epoch ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first two radio transients detected toward the gc were a1742@xmath028 ( @xcite ) and the galactic center transient ( gct , @xcite ) .",
    "these two transients had similar radio properties , but only the former was associated with an x - ray source .",
    "more recently , radio counterparts to the x - ray transients , xte  j1748@xmath0288  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and grs  1739@xmath0278 ( @xcite ) have been detected in the .",

    "we have used recent advances in low - frequency and 3-dimensional imaging to produce a wide - field image ( @xmath3 ) of the gc , with uniform and high resolution across the field , from 0.33  ghz vla observations made between  1986 and  1989 ( @xcite ) . a second image , designed to exploit the increase in number and quality of the 0.33  ghz receivers on the vla since the acquisition of the data used by larosa et al .

    "clearly evident ( @xmath6 ) in the later image is a bright ( @xmath7  mjy ) , unresolved source , gcrt  j1746@xmath02757 .",
    "because gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  appears in only a single epoch , we have conducted a number of tests in order to establish that our detection of gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  is robust .",
    "first , we verified that the source is not an imaging or self - calibration artifact .",
    "gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  is visible on a dirty image , prior to any deconvolution or self - calibration .",
    "the source was also present regardless of the number of facets ( 9 _ vs. _ 49 _ vs. _ 357 ) used in the wide - field imaging .",
    "its presence regardless of the different number of facets means that it is unlikely to be a phase error resulting from the non - coplanar nature of the .",
    "furthermore , the source s location within a facet depended upon the number of facets used , yet the flux densities derived from the three images are consistent .",
    "as the magnitude of phase errors depend typically upon the distance from the phase center of the facet , we consider the constancy of the source s flux density to be strong evidence that the source is real .",
    "a second test was made by imaging sections of the data .",
    "we split the data in both time and frequency . splitting the observations into four , approximately 2-hr time intervals , we find that the transient flux density is constant to within their uncertainties for all but the first time interval .",
    "however , the observing logs indicate several problems encountered during the beginning of the run that could account for that discrepancy .",
    "indeed , if we split the first interval in half , gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  appears in the second half but not the first half . splitting the observations into three equal frequency intervals",

    "we obtained targeted , follow - up vla observations at higher frequencies on 2000 july 15 and 19 and 2000 december 11 .",
    "however , even with the high resolution ( 0.81  @xmath8 0.37 ) and sensitivity ( 0.03  ) achieved in the latter observations at 4.86  ghz , the transient was not recoverable .",

    "the upper limit on its deconvolved angular diameter corresponding to a flux density @xmath10 above the best - fit value is 9 . in turn",

    "we shall assume that its spectral index was the same as that for the gct , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .    the rapid growth and decline in brightness of gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  is consistent with that for the gct and the radio counterpart to the x - ray transient a1742@xmath028 . for frequencies between  1.36  ghz and  1.67  ghz ,",
    "the gct decreased to approximately 12% of its peak flux density in only a month ( @xcite ) .",
    "the only detection of the radio counterpart to a1742@xmath028 was made on  1975 march  30 at  0.96  ghz , followed by non - detections on  1975 may  3 and  june  20 at  0.408 and  0.96  ghz , respectively .",
    "assuming that gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  decayed according to a power law ( @xmath14^{\\beta}$ ] ) with the same index as the gct , @xmath15 ( @xcite ) , and that the peak occurred no later than one day prior to our detection , we would expect its 1.4  ghz flux density to have been no less than about  1  mjy in  2000 december .",
    "as the noise level of our 2000 december  11 follow - up 1.4  ghz observations was much less ( 0.08  ) than this extrapolated value , we conclude that gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  decayed much faster than the gct , its spectrum was steeper , or both .",
    "in contrast to the gct and a1742@xmath028 , both of which were within 1  or so of sgr  a@xmath5 , gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  is located over 1  away , but at a low galactic latitude ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "at about 150 pc from sgr  a@xmath5 in projection , gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  is almost certainly in the galactic bulge , if not in the gc itself .",
    "a second , bright transient that we identify as the radio counterpart to the x - ray transient xte  j1748@xmath0288  ( @xcite , 1998b ; @xcite ) also appears in our images .",
    "this radio transient reached its maximum in  1998 june and was monitored extensively from  1998 june to october at frequencies between  1.45 and  22.5  ghz ( @xcite ; rupen et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "we provide here the first flux density measurements of this transient at  0.33  ghz .",
    "the flux density on  1998 september  25 was @xmath17  mjy , decreasing to @xmath18  mjy on  1998 november  29 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xtespectrum ] shows the spectra obtained by combining our 0.33  ghz flux densities from  1998 september and november with flux densities obtained by the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) at  2.25 and  8.30  ghz on the same dates ( rupen et al .",

    "( 1998 ) reported flux density measurements at five frequencies from vla observations on  1998 june  10.33 and  14.31 .",
    "the spectral indices of these higher frequency measurements are @xmath20 , considerably flatter than the value we find from our later measurements .",
    "we conclude that there was spectral steepening of the source between  1998 june and september .    assuming that the magnetic field in the emission region was of order 1  @xmath21 g and using 025 as the diameter of the source ( @xcite ) , we conclude that the source was probably _",
    "not _ synchrotron self - absorbed .",
    "thus , we estimate the 0.33  ghz flux density on  1998 june  7 , 10 , and  14 to be 106 , 280 , and  1006  mjy , respectively . additional analysis of these combined data sets will be reported elsewhere ( rupen et al .",

    "we have detected two radio transients in the galactic center .    1 .",
    "gcrt  j1746@xmath02757  ( figure  [ fig : discovery ] ) was a nonthermal source with a rapid temporal evolution .",
    "although limited , our spectral and temporal constraints indicate that its characteristics were similar to that of previous gc radio transients , though its temporal evolution must have been faster , its spectrum steeper , or both .",
    "no x - ray counterpart was detected .",
    "we have also detected xte  j1748@xmath0288  at a frequency for which it had not been observed previously , and we present evidence that the spectrum has steepened significantly over a period of a few months ( figure  [ fig : xtespectrum ] ) .",
    "the observations we present here , combined with previous gc radio transients , suggest that the gc may harbor a population(s ) of radio transients .",
    "however , our observations also indicate that the rapid brightening and fading of transient sources requires much more extensive and frequent observations in order to detect and monitor a large number of radio sources .",
    "these measurements can then be used to determine , e.g. , the angular distribution and typical timescale of the source population toward the . such statistics and other individual and group properties are necessary to constrain the nature of the transient and variable source population(s ) .",

    "vla observations at  0.33  ghz of the gc present a near optimal means to achieve these goals .",
