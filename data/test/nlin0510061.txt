    "in this paper we are concerned with the study of the three - dimensional map @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 with three parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "this map is a natural generalization of the famous two - dimensional hnon map @xcite ; indeed , like the latter , the map ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) is quadratic , has constant jacobian @xmath11 and moreover , when @xmath12 , reduces to the two - dimensional hnon map .",
    "therefore , it is natural to call ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) the  _",
    "3d hnon map_. \" we will study a number of properties of ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) , including :    1 .",
    "its nontrivial dynamics and , most importantly , the existence of _ wild - hyperbolic _ strange attractors ; 2 .   its origination in homoclinic bifurcations ; 3 .",
    "its structure as a member of the family of three - dimensional quadratic maps with constant jacobian .",
    "three - dimensional maps have not been as widely studied as one- and two - dimensional maps , though in recent years there has been a considerable increase in their study .",
    "one of important reasons for this fact is that multi - dimensional dynamical systems ( the dimension of the phase space is at least four for flows and three for maps ) can exhibit complicated dynamics that is decidedly distinct from lower - dimensional cases . in particular they can possess a new variety of strange attractor called a _ wild - hyperbolic attractor _ @xcite .",
    "wild - hyperbolic attractors have no uniform hyperbolic structure ; moreover , they may contain homoclinic tangencies and coexisting periodic orbits of different types .",
    "however , these attractors contain no stable invariant subsets such as attracting periodic orbits .",
    "most crucially , the latter property holds for open regions in the space of smooth dynamical systems .",
    "thus , wild - hyperbolic attractors are very interesting objects and their detection in concrete models is a fundamental problem of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "most of the strange attractors occurring in two - dimensional , smooth maps ( or three - dimensional flows ) are not structurally stable since they possess homoclinic tangencies .",
    "for such systems , even though the orbits are observed to be quite chaotic for some parameter values , very small changes in the parameters may destroy the aperiodicity and give rise to periodic behavior .",
    "such parameter regions are called _ stability windows_. even if these windows are not  observable `` in numerical computations , their appearance ( under arbitrarily small perturbations ) is inevitable because of the prevalence of homoclinic tangencies .",
    "such attractors were called _",
    "quasi - attractors _ in @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in dynamical systems is to distinguish aperiodic motion from extremely long periodic motion .",
    "moreover , since most of the chaotic attractors we see in applications are definitely quasi - attractors , it is unclear in which sense they are chaotic , or how one can define and measure the ' ' probability \" for a quasi - attractor to be chaotic .",
    "however , it is well - known that there are strange attractors that are free of these problems ; for example , hyperbolic attractors and the lorenz attractor . though the latter is not structurally stable @xcite,@xcite ( in contrast to hyperbolic attractors ) it contains no stable periodic orbits , every orbit in it has positive maximal lyapunov exponent , etc .",
    "moreover , these properties are robust @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the reason is that lorenz attractor possesses a pseudo - hyperbolic structure . in terms of turaev and shilnikov",
    "@xcite this means that the following properties hold :    1 .",
    "there is a direction in which the flow is strongly contracting ( `` strongly '' means that any possible contraction in transverse directions is always strictly weaker ) ; and 2 .",
    "transverse to this direction the flow expands areas .",
    "the robustness of pseudo - hyperbolicity ensures the robustness of the chaotic behavior of orbits in the lorenz attractor .",
    "moreover , pseudo - hyperbolicity is maintained even for ( small , indeed ) time - periodic perturbations so that a periodically forced lorenz attractor is an example of a genuinely  strange \" attractor since it contains no stable invariant subsets ( for more discussion see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "however it is necessary to note that homoclinic tangencies arise inevitably under such perturbations .",
    "consequently systems with periodically forced lorenz attractors fall into newhouse regions and demonstrate an extremely rich dynamics @xcite,@xcite .",
    "such attractors were called wild - hyperbolic attractors in @xcite ; in this paper the theory of wild - pseudo - hyperbolic attractor was discussed and an example of a wild - hyperbolic spiral attractor was constructed .",
    "generalizing these ideas , we say that wild - hyperbolic attractors possess the following two main properties that distinguish them from other attractors : ( 1 ) wild - hyperbolic attractors allow homoclinic tangencies ( hence , they belong to newhouse regions ) ; ( 2 ) every such attractor and all nearby attractors ( in the @xmath13-topology with @xmath14 ) have no stable periodic orbits .",
    "one of the most felicitous properties of wild - hyperbolic attractors is that they can be created in _",
    "local bifurcations _ of periodic orbits ; in particular , when the orbit has three or more floquet multipliers on the unit circle @xcite .",
    "consequently , the construction of wild - hyperbolic attractors in concrete models is possible when the model contains sufficiently many parameters to permit such a degeneracy .",
    "indeed , the map ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) is sufficiently complex and has been shown to possess wild - hyperbolic attractors @xcite . moreover , numerical simulations have shown that these attractors persist in quite big parameter domains and can be order - one in size @xcite .    in  [ sec :",
    "attractors ] we will show that ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) has a small , wild - hyperbolic lorenz attractor in a ( small ) parameter domain near the point @xmath15 at which a fixed point with multipliers @xmath16 exists . the general case of fixed points with such a triplet of multipliers was considered in @xcite , where it was shown that two distinct cases occur .",
    "one of these cases has a local flow normal form that coincides with the shimitsu - marioka system ( see ( [ = sm ] ) ) .",
    "this system has a lorenz attractor in some parameter domains @xcite,@xcite .",
    "as was noted in @xcite a periodically forced lorenz system ( when the perturbation is rather small ) can give rise to a wild - hyperbolic attractor .",
    "moreover , this does not destroy the pseudo - hyperbolicity of the attractor @xcite,@xcite .",
    "note that the flow normal form only approximates the map and , since the residual terms are exponentially small in time , it is reasonable that the map will have a wild - hyperbolic attractor ( which is small , in fact , because the approximation must be very good ) , see more discussions in @xcite .",
    "the second property of ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) that we mentioned above is that this map can arise as a local normal form for multi - dimensional systems with a homoclinic tangency .",
    "this shows that such maps are not exotic and gives a reason for an extensive study of their properties .",
    "it is well - known that quadratic maps appear naturally when studying bifurcations of quadratic homoclinic tangencies @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "they appear as normal forms of rescaled first return maps to the neighborhood of a point on the homoclinic orbit .",
    "there are four standard forms for such one- and two - dimensional  homoclinic maps : \"    1 .",
    "@xmath17 ( the logistic map ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath18 ( the standard hnon map ) ; 3 .",
    "@xmath19 ( the mira map ) ; 4 .",
    "@xmath20 ( a generalized hnon map ) .",
    "the third case is a two - dimensional endomorphism and is one of the well - studied polynomial maps ( see , e.g. @xcite ) ; we call it the  mira map \" following @xcite )",
    ". the fourth case can be obtained as a small perturbation ( due to @xmath21-terms ) of the standard hnon map .",
    "this map was obtained in a study of bifurcations of two - dimensional diffeomorphisms with a homoclinic tangency to a saddle fixed point ( with unit jacobian ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the 3d hnon map ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) is absent from this list , and in  [ sec : local][sec : rescaling ] we will fill this gap .    in  [ sec : local ] we study bifurcations of a three - dimensional diffeomorphism with quadratic homoclinic tangency to a saddle - focus fixed point . for a three - dimensional map , such points can be of two types : @xmath22 or @xmath23 ( sometimes called _ type a _ and _ type b _ , respectively ) .",
    "recall that @xmath24 saddle is a fixed point with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in our case the two - dimensional manifold will be assumed to correspond to a complex conjugate pair of multipliers .",
    "we will consider the case where the the product the absolute value of the multipliers , @xmath28 is one .",
    "the bifurcations in the general case , where @xmath29 , were studied in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we will use their  rescaling method \" to study our case as well .",
    "the essence of this method is that a suitable change of coordinates and parameters in a neighborhood of the homoclinic orbit is found to bring the map into a standard form .",
    "if the homoclinic tangency is assumed to be quadratic the resulting map is also typically quadratic .",
    "for example , for a type @xmath22 saddle - focus with @xmath30 , the rescaled first return maps coincide with the standard hnon map up to asymptotically small terms ( when the time of return tend to infinity ) . for a saddle - focus of type @xmath23 ,",
    "the corresponding rescaled first return map is the mira map .",
    "note the condition @xmath31 leads to maps that are effectively two - dimensional ; consequently all three - dimensional volumes near the fixed point are collapsed .",
    "this is not the case when @xmath32 for the unperturbed map when three - dimensional rescaled maps can appear a priori .",
    "indeed , we will show that when @xmath33 the map ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) occurs as the normal form of the rescaled map for type @xmath22 saddle - focus ; and for the type @xmath23 case the corresponding normal form is ) is also the rescaled first return map for a four - dimensional diffeomorphism that has a quadratic homoclinic tangency to a saddle - focus fixed point with two pairs of complex conjugate leading multipliers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . ]",
    "@xmath34    both ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3hm2 ] ) are quadratic three - dimensional maps with constant jacobian @xmath35 .",
    "it is natural to call them the three - dimensional hnon maps of the _ first _ and _ second kind _ , respectively .",
    "the quadratic 3d hnon maps are elements of the group of polynomial automorphisms .",
    "the study of the dynamics of polynomial mappings has a long history applied dynamics ; for example , they often used in the study of particle accelerators @xcite .",
    "the study of _ cremona maps _",
    ", i.e. , polynomial maps with constant jacobian , also has intrinsic mathematical interest @xcite .",
    "an interesting mathematical problem is to obtain a normal form for an arbitrary degree-@xmath36 cremona map .",
    "this problem is unsolved ; the major obstruction is that it is not known in general that such a map has a polynomial inverse .",
    "this is the content of the much studied ,  jacobian conjecture \" :    let @xmath37 be a cremona map",
    ". then @xmath38 is bijective and has a polynomial inverse .",
    "this conjecture is still open .",
    "the set of polynomial maps with polynomial inverses is called the _ affine cremona group_. for the case of the plane , the structure of this group was obtained by jung @xcite .",
    "jung s theorem states that planar polynomial diffeomorphisms are `` tame ; '' that is , they can be written as a finite composition of `` elementary '' ( or triangular ) and affine maps .",
    "more recently friedland and milnor @xcite showed that any map in this group is either conjugate to a composition of generalized hnon maps , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a polynomial and @xmath41 , or else the map is dynamically trivial .",
    "not much is known about the structure of the affine cremona group for higher dimensions , though it was recently proved that the three - dimensional cremona map @xmath42 is not tame @xcite .",
    "thus the normal form for the 3d affine cremona group must consist of more than tame maps .",
    "however , it is still possible that the nontame maps are dynamically trivial , like the above example .",
    "another interesting problem concerns the approximation of smooth diffeomorphisms by polynomial diffeomorphisms .",
    "one result along this direction is for the class of @xmath43 symplectic diffeomorphisms , which , as turaev has shown @xcite , can be approximated by compositions of the symplectic cremona maps @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is a polynomial .",
    "related approximation methods are used in the study of particle accelerators @xcite , and results have also been obtained for analytic symplectic maps @xcite .    some work has been done on finding normal forms for quadratic symplectic and quadratic volume - preserving maps .",
    "moser showed that every quadratic symplectic map in @xmath47 can be written as the composition of an affine symplectic map and a symplectic shear @xcite .",
    "for the four - dimensional case , he obtained a normal form .",
    "for the case of volume - preserving maps , it was shown in @xcite,@xcite that any quadratic three - dimensional , volume - preserving map whose inverse is also quadratic and whose dynamics is non - trivial can be transformed ( by affine transformations ) to the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and one of the parameters @xmath51 or @xmath52 can be eliminated ( by a coordinate shift ) . by analogy with the planar results , there are two additional cases but they have trivial dynamics ( see  [ sec : quadratic ] ) .",
    "we also note that it is not hard to construct three - dimensional quadratic diffeomorphisms that do not fall into this classification because they have an inverse of higher degree .",
    "for example , the diffeomorphism @xmath53 has a quartic inverse .",
    "note that both of the maps ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3hm2 ] ) fall into the form ( [ eq:3hm3 ] ) .",
    "thus the results of @xcite show that when @xmath54 both of the 3d hnon maps occur as normal forms for quadratic elements of the affine cremona group . moreover , even when @xmath55 the map ( [ eq:3hm2 ] ) is a normal form for a certain class of quadratic maps @xcite .",
    "tatjer showed that every quadratic map , @xmath38 , for which @xmath56 is also quadratic , but has no invariant linear foliation is linearly conjugate to ( [ eq:3hm2 ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : statement ] , we will generalize the results of @xcite to show that ( [ eq:3hm3 ] ) is the the normal form for quadratic diffeomorphisms with quadratic inverses when @xmath55 as well .",
    "consider a three - dimensional diffeomorphism @xmath57 for some @xmath58 that satisfies the following conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : type21 ] ) :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 has a type @xmath22 saddle - focus fixed point @xmath59 with multipliers @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( w.l.o.g .",
    "@xmath62 ) , ; 2 .   @xmath63 .",
    "3 .   the stable , @xmath64 , and unstable , @xmath65 , invariant manifolds of the fixed point @xmath59 have a quadratic homoclinic tangency at the points of a homoclinic orbit @xmath66 .",
    "saddle - focus for the map @xmath0 under assumputions ( a)-(c ) .",
    "[ fig : type21],width=288 ]    diffeomorphisms that are close to @xmath0 and satisfy conditions ( b ) and ( c ) comprise , in the space of @xmath13 diffeomorphisms , a codimension - two , locally - connected surface @xmath67the bifurcation surface .",
    "our main problem is to study bifurcations of periodic orbits in families of diffeomorphisms that transversely cross @xmath67 .",
    "we denote such a family by @xmath4 so that @xmath0 satisfies ( a)-(c ) .",
    "the first question that arises is the optimal choice of the governing parameters @xmath68 .",
    "it is evident that the set of such parameters must include both a parameter @xmath69 of the splitting of the initial quadratic homoclinic tangency and a parameter @xmath70 , similar to @xmath71 , that varies the jacobian of the saddle - focus fixed point .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that diffeomorphisms on @xmath67 possess continuous ( topological ) conjugacy invariants on the set of non - wandering orbits , so - called @xmath72-moduli .",
    "the most important modulus is the angular argument @xmath73 of the complex multipliers of the saddle - focus ( see  [ sec : rescaling ] ) . by definition ,",
    "@xmath72-moduli are natural governing parameters .",
    "therefore , we include the @xmath72-modulus @xmath73 into the set of governing parameters .",
    "thus , we take as the third parameter @xmath74 .",
    "more generally , we must consider a three - parameter family @xmath75 , @xmath76 , that is transversal to @xmath67 at @xmath5 and such that @xmath77    consider a sufficiently small and fixed neighbourhood @xmath78 of the orbit @xmath66 .",
    "it can be represented as a union of a small neighbourhood @xmath79 of @xmath59 with a number of small neighbourhoods of those points of @xmath66 which do not belong to @xmath79 . in the family @xmath75",
    "we study bifurcations of _ single - round periodic orbits _ from @xmath78that is orbits periodic that enter @xmath79 exactly once .",
    "every point of such an orbit of period @xmath80 can be considered as a fixed point of the corresponding first return map @xmath81 along orbits lying in @xmath78 . in  [ sec : rescaling ] , we will prove the following result about the form of this first return map in some domains of the parameters .",
    "[ tm:1 ] let @xmath75 be the three parameter family defined above .",

    ", the jacobian , @xmath10 , is positive or negative depending on the orientability of the map @xmath81 .",
    "the terms denoted @xmath87 are functions ( of the coordinates and parameters ) that tend to zero as @xmath88 along with all derivatives up to order @xmath89 .",
    "theorem [ tm:1 ] shows that the 3d hnon map ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) is a normal form for this homoclinic bifurcation , since it appears when we omit the @xmath87-terms in ( [ eq : t07 + 1 ] ) .",
    "we will see that the new parameters @xmath90 and @xmath10 can be given as functions of @xmath91 by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is some coefficient ( an invariant of @xmath0 ) and @xmath94 .",
    "the exact relations will be given in formulas ( [ mpar * ] ) , ( [ eq : t04 ] ) and ( [ eq : t06 ] ) below .",
    "thus , we can study the bifurcations of single round periodic orbits in the family @xmath75 , when @xmath95 , by studying the bifurcations of fixed points of the 3d hnon map ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) .",
    "certainly , the problem of studying bifurcations in the 3d hnon map is much simpler than the corresponding problem for the original first return maps .",
    "moreover , the 3d hnon map provides a simple , standard model for which various well - tried methods ( including numerical ones ) can be applied .",
    "however , the bifurcation problem as whole for the 3d hnon map is very complicated and here we focus only on two aspects . in  [ sec : attractors ] we first give the simple construction of bifurcation surfaces , lines and points corresponding , respectively , to codimension one , two and three bifurcations of the fixed points .",
    "then we consider the problem of the existence of wild - hyperbolic strange attractors .",
    "we will obtain the following result .",
    "[ tm:2 ] let @xmath75 be the three parameter general family defined as before .",
    "then , in any neighborhood of the origin @xmath5 of the space of parameters , there exist infinitely many open domains @xmath96 such that the diffeomorphism @xmath75 of the family at @xmath97 has a wild - hyperbolic strange attractor of lorenz - type .",
    "the proof of this theorem is given in ",
    "[ sec : attractors ] following the analysis of @xcite",
    ". the main idea of the proof is to apply the results of paper @xcite where it was shown that maps having a fixed point with the triplet @xmath98 of multipliers can , in some cases , be reduced to a flow normal form that coincides with the shimitsu - marioka system ( see ( [ fl1 ] ) ) which possesses a lorenz attractor for some parameter domains @xcite,@xcite .",

    "[ tm:2 ] . a justification of the fact that the attractor in the 3d hnon map is actually the wild - hyperbolic lorenz - type attractor is given in @xcite .",
    "consequently , we will omit these details .",

    "the dynamics of each of the maps ( [ eq:3hm1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3hm2 ] ) is extremely rich .",
