    "gaussian _ two - mode squeezed vacuum state .",
    "this state is relatively easy to work with theoretically and is also commonly produced in the laboratory .",
    "it has been successfully applied to implement various important protocols , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite and entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "these successes are based on well - developed techniques of optical gaussian operations .",
    "these consist of beam splitting , phase shifting , squeezing , displacement and homodyne detection .",
    "however , recent theoretical investigations have shown some limits on such operations .",
    "a prime example is the no - go theorem relating to the distillation of entanglement shared by distant parties using only gaussian local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite . to go beyond this limit",
    ", one should use higher order nonlinear processes , such as the cubic - phase gate @xcite or kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "it is , however , difficult to implement these nonlinear processes with presently available materials , which do not have sufficiently high nonlinearity and suffer from losses .",
    "a more practical alternative method has been developed , which uses nonlinear processes induced by photon counting on tapped - off beams from squeezed states @xcite .",
    "when ideal photon number resolving detectors are used , the input gaussian state can be transformed into a non - gaussian pure state with higher entanglement . in practice , however , such detectors are not yet suitable for practical use .",
    "the most reliable type of photodetector available at present is the on / off type photon detector based on avalanche photodiodes .",
    "this device can only distinguish the vacuum ( ` off ' ) state from non - vacuum ( ` on ' ) states .",
    "the latter events result in a non - gaussian mixed state .",
    "evaluating the entanglement of such a state is far from trivial .",
    "previously , the effect of entanglement has been theoretically analysed based on the figures of merit of concrete protocols , such as the fidelity of teleportation @xcite , the degree of violation of bell - type inequalities @xcite and the mutual information of dense coding @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the performance of every protocol was improved , implying that the entanglement of the non - gaussian mixed state must be enhanced . however ,",
    "these indirect evaluations were dependent upon some external parameters , which depend upon specific operations differing from protocol to another , such as the type of input state for the teleportation fidelity , the choice of the measurement basis for the bell - type inequality violation , and the signal power of modulation for the dense coding .    quantifying the entanglement of",
    "the photon - subtracted squeezed state , in a way which is independent of particular external parameters , is our main concern in this paper . to our knowledge",
    ", this problem has not been previously addressed . for a state @xmath0 ,",
    "an entanglement measure @xmath1 should satisfy the following criteria @xcite : ( i ) @xmath2 is the non - negative functional , ( ii ) @xmath2 vanishes if the state @xmath3 is separable and ( iii ) @xmath2 should not increase _ on average _ under locc . in general , a quantity satisfying these criteria is known as an entanglement monotone .",
    "many such quantities have been proposed , such as the entanglement of formation @xcite , the entanglement cost @xcite , the distillable entanglement @xcite , and the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not easy to calculate these measures for generic mixed states .",
    "recently , however , two entanglement measures which are much more amenable to evaluation have been proposed .",
    "these are the negativity and the logarithmic negativity @xcite .",
    "these measures are based on the peres criterion @xcite .",
    "that is , they are defined in terms of the eigenvalues of the partially - transposed density operator .",
    "the most distinctive feature of these entanglement measures is that they are easily computable numerically with linear algebra packages .",
    "furthermore , the logarithmic negativity is an additive functional , and it is an upper bound on the distillable entanglement @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in addition to being an entanglement monotone , it was believed that an entanglement measure @xmath2 should also be ( downward ) convex , i.e. it should be non - increasing on average under the loss of classical information by mixing .",
    "convexity is necessary for an entanglement measure to be bounded from above by the entanglement of formation @xmath5 @xcite , although the logarithm function is concave ( upward convex ) .",
    "recently , however , it has been shown by plenio _",
    "et al _ @xcite that convexity is not directly related to the physical process of discarding _ quantum _ information , i.e. discarding subsystems such as local ancillas during locc operations and that the logarithmic negativity is indeed a full entanglement monotone @xcite . in view of these considerations , it is interesting to evaluate the entanglement of photon - subtracted mixed state in terms of the ( logarithmic ) negativities , and to compare them the figures of merit associated with the aforementioned protocols .",
    "of particular interest to us is how the entanglement , and these figures of merit , are enhanced by the photon - subtraction procedure .",
