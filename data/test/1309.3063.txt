    "grand minima and north - south asymmetry of solar activity may be mutually related .",
    "@xcite found that almost all sunspots at the end of the mounder minimum were in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the asymmetry reduced in the course of the return of the sun to its normal activity level so that several decades after the mounder minimum the asymmetry was no longer pronounced in sunspot records @xcite .",
    "it may be noted also that polar field reversal in the ( unusually low ) current 24th cycle of solar activity is highly asymmetric @xcite .",
    "this paper shows that the correlation of the magnetic activity level with its hemispheric asymmetry naturally emerges in the dynamo theory and the increased asymmetry in epochs of global minima can be reproduced by solar dynamo models .",
    "the currently leading theory of grand minima ( and maxima ) of solar activity explains them by randomness in dynamo parameters .",
    "the relevant literature is extensive . without attempting a complete referencing ,",
    "the papers of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite introducing the basic ideas can be quoted .",
    "global magnetic fields are generated by turbulent convection .",
    "therefore , dynamo - parameters experience random fluctuations .",
    "random changes in magnetic field generation mechanisms on time scale of months and years result in irregular variations of magnetic cycle amplitudes on much longer scales of decades and centuries so that the sun spends about 17% of its life in states of subnormal magnetic activity or grand minima @xcite .",
    "random fluctuations in dynamo parameters are also essential for reproducing the observed waldmeier relation @xcite and polar field reversals @xcite by dynamo models .",
    "randomness of dynamo is naturally allowed for by 3d numerical simulations where dynamically chaotic fluctuations are automatically included . however , in spite of remarkable progress in direct numerical simulations of solar dynamo @xcite , work on the dynamo theory of grand minima was done almost entirely within the mean - field approach .",
    "long - term 3d runs remain too demanding numerically .",
    "mean - field theory has , however , a conceptual difficulty in allowance for randomness of dynamo - parameters .",
    "the theory operates with averaged parameters .",
    "the averaging procedure is usually understood as ensemble - averaging .",
    "random fluctuations can not be expected in so - averaged parameters .",
    "ensemble averaging is , however , not the type of averaging of practical use in processing observational data , where temporal or spatial averaging is applied instead",
    ". if the averaging is , e.g. , over longitude , the resulting axisymmetric parameters still fluctuate .",
    "the babcock - leighton mechanism of poloidal field generation is related to properties of solar active regions ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) . even in the epochs of activity maxima , several active regions only are simultaneously present on the sun , so that fluctuations of the same order or even exceeding mean values can be expected .    most work on dynamos with fluctuating parameters concerns fluctuations with time only .",
    "random dependencies on position were disregarded ( see , however , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we have to include random dependence on latitude in dynamo parameters in order to account for hemispheric asymmetry induced by the fluctuations .",
    "this paper concerns a solar dynamo model with latitude and time dependent fluctuations in the poloidal field generation mechanism .",
    "when the fluctuations are neglected , dynamo - modes can possess a certain equatorial symmetry .",
    "the threshold dynamo number for excitation of the fields of dipolar equatorial symmetry in our model is considerably smaller compared to quadrupolar fields .",
    "thus , the model prefers equator anti - symmetric global fields that dominate on the sun @xcite .",
    "@xcite addressed the parity issue for the babcock - leighton type dynamos to conclude that preference for dipolar or quadrupolar parity is defined by whether the characteristic time of diffusion or advection by the meridional flow , respectively , is shorter .",
    "preference for dipolar parity in our model is most probably related to relatively large turbulent diffusion or , more specifically , to relatively low ( @xmath0 ) magnetic reynolds number of the meridional flow .",
    "latitude - dependent fluctuations in dynamo - parameters violate the equatorial symmetry .",
    "a part of magnetic energy is transmitted to quadrupolar fields that are not supported by the dynamo and thus decay .",
    "accordingly , the model shows anti - correlation between deviations from dipolar parity and amplitudes of magnetic cycles .",
    "substantial hemispheric asymmetry is typically present in the epochs of low magnetic cycles , similar to the observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our dynamo model is very close to that of the preceding paper ( @xcite @xcite ; ko12 hereafter ) .",
    "the main difference is that now we allow for random fluctuations in dynamo - parameters . only what is related to these fluctuations",
    "will be described in all details .",
    "the rest of the model description is nevertheless complete though concise .",

    "dynamo equations are formulated for the mean magnetic field @xmath1 which is assumed to be axisymmetric ( longitude - averaged ) .",
    "detailed discussions of the mean - field electrodynamics and the methods used to derive the mean - field induction equation can be found in literature ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite or a more recent formulation by @xcite ) .",
    "our model employs the simple version of the equation , @xmath2 ,      \\label{1}\\ ] ] that , however , includes all the basic effects .",
    "the first term in the rhs describes advection of the field @xmath1 by the mean flow with the velocity @xmath3 .",
    "small - scale motions give rise to the turbulent diffusion with the diffusivity @xmath4 .",
    "note that the second term in the rhs of eq.([1 ] ) accounts for not only turbulent diffusion but also for diamagnetic pumping of the field with effective velocity @xmath5 turbulent conducting fluid acts as a diamagnet : large - scale fields are expelled from regions of relatively high intensity of turbulent convection ( @xcite @xcite , chapter 9.5 ) .",
    "diamagnetic pumping is very important for our model . only with allowance for the pumping",

    "toroidal and poloidal parts can be separated in the large - scale flow and magnetic field , @xmath11 @xmath12 where the usual spherical coordinates @xmath13 are used , @xmath14 is the unit vector in azimuthal direction , @xmath15 is the characteristic value of angular velocity , @xmath16 is the normalized rotation rate , @xmath17 is the stream function of meridional flow , @xmath18 is the toroidal field , and @xmath19 is the poloidal field potential .",

    "the normalized equation for the toroidal field reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dynamo number and @xmath31 is the magnetic reynolds number for the meridional flow .",
    "equation ( [ 7 ] ) describes the toroidal field production by differential rotation , its advection by the meridional flow , diamagnetic pumping , and turbulent diffusion .    the poloidal field equation , which accounts for random fluctuations in the field generation term , is written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the radius of the inner boundary .",
    "the integration in the first term in the rhs is only in the radius with the upper limit @xmath34 .",
    "this qualitatively reflects the fact that generation of poloidal fields at some point @xmath34 is contributed by the buoyant magnetic loops rising from deeper layers and that the rise velocities are almost vertical .",
    "the quantity @xmath35 in eq.([10 ] ) is the relative amplitude of fluctuations in the generation term .",
    "the mean value of the generation term is antisymmetric about the equator , as it should be for the effect of the coriolis force .",
    "we do not expect , however , that the fluctuations are equator - antisymmetric or vanishing at the equator .",
    "randomness in the generation mechanism is accounted for by the random function @xmath36 of time and latitude ; the rms value of @xmath36 is unity .",
    "this function is defined in section2.3 .",
    "the babcock - leighton mechanism is related to the tilts of bipolar magnetic regions , i.e. to the fact that the regions of magnetic polarity leading in rotational motion are on average closer to the equator than the following polarity .",
    "observations summarised by @xcite and theoretical computations of @xcite both show that the tilt angles do not increase steadily with latitude but have a maximum .",
    "the factor @xmath37 in the first term of the rhs of eq.([10 ] ) reflects this non - monotonous dependence ( for the often assumed @xmath38 profile of the alpha - effect , the factor would be @xmath39 ) .",
    "latitudinal distribution of toroidal fields in our model depends , however , little on the latitudinal profile of the alpha - effect ( ko12 ) .",

    "the initial value problem for dynamo equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) was solved numerically by the grid - point method and explicit time stepping .",
    "after several diffusion times , the solution becomes independent of the initial condition .",
    "the diamagnetic pumping results in a high concentration of the magnetic fields near the bottom boundary where diffusivity is relatively low .",
    "a non - uniform grid in radius with spacing @xmath40 was applied to resolve the fine radial structure .",

    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the kernel functions of eq.([12 ] ) together with the diffusivity profile used in the computations .",
    "the turbulent diffusivity varies mildly in the bulk of the convection zone but decreases sharply with depth near its base .",
    "the diffusivity profile of our model mimics this behavior @xmath57 the @xmath58 in this equation is the ratio of radiation interior - to - convection zone diffusivities .",

    "computations were performed for the smallest value of @xmath59 accessible in the numerical model .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the diffusivity profile for the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 used in the computations .",
    "the thin bottom layer of small diffusivity is very important for the model .",
    "almost all toroidal magnetic flux is contained in this layer due to the downward diamagnetic pumping of eq .",

    "the meridional flow of the model has one circulation cell per hemisphere with a poleward flow on the top and a return equator - ward motion near the bottom .",

    "measurements of the deep near - bottom flow give controversial results .",
    "theoretical models of global solar circulation predict that the return flow at the base of the convection zone is not small compared to the surface @xcite .",
    "the flow , however , decreases rapidly with depth beneath the base @xcite .",
    "all these characteristics are qualitatively reflected by the following prescription for the stream - function of eq.([5 ] ) @xmath62 used in the dynamo model . in this equation , @xmath63 is the radius of the stagnation point where the meridional velocity changes sign , and @xmath64 is a parameter whose value is adjusted to ensure continuity of the stream function at the stagnation point .",

    "it may be noted that mean - field models with smaller values of the eddy viscosity and thermal diffusivity are hydrodynamically unstable @xcite .",
    "the smaller values , therefore , can not be a correct parameterization for solar convection .",
    "direct numerical simulations of @xcite suggest that the eddy magnetic diffusivity is of the same order of magnitude as the eddy viscosity .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) equal @xmath73 , slightly above the critical value for excitation of dipolar modes ( @xmath74 ) but below the threshold value for quadrupolar fields ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "slight difference in the dynamo numbers with ko12 is explained by the difference in the meridional flow .",
    "randomness of the poloidal field generation mechanism is represented in the dynamo equation ( [ 10 ] ) by the random function @xmath76 .",
    "we use a method very close to that of @xcite to model this function .    random dependence on time only can be modelled by solving numerically the equation @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the characteristic time scale of fluctuations , and @xmath79 is the random number renovated each time step of a numerical computation .",
    "the resulting random dependence on time can be characterised by the correlation function @xmath80 applying the random forcing @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is the random number with gaussian distribution , zero mean , rms value equal one , and renovated each time step @xmath83 independently of its former value ) , we get @xmath84 for the case of a small time step @xmath85 .",
    "note that the forcing @xmath79 is short correlated in time but the characteristic time @xmath78 of the correlation ( [ 16 ] ) is much longer .",
    "the correlation ( [ 16 ] ) , however , is singular at @xmath86 .",
    "the function @xmath87 is dominated by the latest realization of the forcing @xmath79 . in order to make the function @xmath87 more smooth , we apply the two - steps scheme @xmath88 equations ( [ 17 ] ) with the forcing @xmath89 ( @xmath82 is the same gaussian random number as before ) leads to the correlation @xmath90 which is now smooth at @xmath91 .",
    "it was confirmed by computations that the numerical solution of eq.([17 ] ) with forcing @xmath79 renovated each time step reproduces the correlation function ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "to involve random dependence not on time only but on the latitude as well , we use the forcing @xmath92 in this equation , @xmath93 is the characteristic scale of fluctuations in latitude , and @xmath94 is the random co - latitude uniformly distributed in the range @xmath95 $ ] between the north and south poles .",
    "the random value of @xmath94 was also renovated each time step .",
    "equations ( [ 17 ] ) with forcing ( [ 19 ] ) are solved numerically together with the dynamo equations to realise the random dependence of the poloidal field generation on time and latitude .",
    "the random function @xmath76 has rms value close to one everywhere except for the near - polar regions of extent @xmath93 .",
    "the latitudinal scale of fluctuations in our computations @xmath96 , is close to the latitudinal extent of solar active regions .",
    "characteristic realisation of the random function is shown in fig.[f3 ] .",
    "the time scale @xmath78 was taken equal to the period of solar rotation .",
    "the amplitude of the fluctuations in equation ( [ 10 ] ) @xmath97 was specified after estimations of the fluctuations of the babcock - leighton mechanism using sunspot data @xcite .",
    "random dependence on latitude in the magnetic field generation mechanism prevents the appearance of magnetic fields of pure equatorial symmetry .",
    "the fields are superposition of equator - symmetric or quadrupolar , @xmath98 , and equator - antisymmetric or dipolar , @xmath99 , components , @xmath100 .",
    "similar to the field observed on the sun , the dipolar component dominates when the amplitude of magnetic cycles is not too low @xcite , i.e. , away from the grand minima .",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows the time - latitude diagram for such a span of normal magnetic cycles .",
    "we use the diffusivity value @xmath101@xmath71/s to convert normalised time of numerical computations into physical time of this figure . with this value , the averaged period of magnetic cycles of 9.7 yr is not far from the observed 11-year period .",
    "the equatorial drift of the toroidal field is a consequence of the field transport by the meridional flow while the polar branches in the poloidal field diagram are caused mainly by the field diffusion from mid latitudes where the alpha - effect of our model has a maximum ( ko12 ) .",
    "the near - bottom toroidal field in fig.[f4 ] varies with time much more smoothly than the surface poloidal field .",
    "this is because the random fluctuations in the generation mechanism are directly affecting the poloidal filed .",
    "the fine latitudinal structure is largely smoothed - out in the course of the poloidal field diffusion to the base of the convection zone where the toroidal field is generated by differential rotation .",
    "the total ( volume - integrated ) magnetic energy can also be represented as the sum of the energies of dipolar and quadrupolar components of the magnetic field , @xmath102 .",
    "we use the standard parity index , @xmath103 to characterise equatorial symmetry of the simulated fields .",
    "the time - dependent index is normally negative indicating predominance of the dipolar component in the generated field .",
    "the mean value over the entire simulation time of about 11000 years is @xmath104 .",
    "however , the parity index usually increases when magnetic energy decreases in the course of a transition to a grand minimum .",
    "a characteristic example is shown in fig.[f5 ] where the parity index ( [ 20 ] ) is shown together with the unsigned magnetic flux @xmath105 in the near - bottom region .",
    "this quantity is the latitude - integrated contribution of the near - bottom toroidal field into the terms of eqs.([10 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) responsible for the generation of the near - surface poloidal field .",
    "as the generation terms represent the babcock - leighton mechanism in our model , the quantity ( [ 21 ] ) can be considered as proxy of the sunspot number .",
    "on average , the parity index increases when @xmath106 decreases .",
    "the correlation of the deviations of the parity index and the @xmath106-parameter from their mean values equals -0.30 .",
    "the negative correlation can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the model excites preferentially dipolar fields .",
    "latitude - dependent random fluctuations in the alpha - effect transmit a part of the magnetic energy to quadrupolar modes .",
    "the quadrupolar modes are subcritical for dynamo excitation and decay .",
    "deviations from dipolar parity thus reduce the magnetic energy .",
    "large deviations can even promote transitions to grand minima .",
    "if this explanation is correct , deviations of the global magnetic field of the sun from an equator - antisymmetric state can be used as an indicator of a decrease in magnetic activity .",
    "figure[f6 ] shows the butterfly diagram of the near - bottom toroidal field for a simulated grand minimum .",
    "the north - south asymmetry is large in the middle of the minimum epoch similar to the butterfly diagram of sunspots observed at the end of the maunder minimum @xcite .",
    "there is no reliable recipe for transforming magnetic fields of dynamo models into sunspot number .",
    "we use the simplest linear relation between the @xmath106-parameter of eq.([21 ] ) and the modelled sunspot number @xmath107 @xmath108 where the proportionality factor was tuned so that the maximum @xmath107 in our computations equals the maximum sunspot number reconstructed by @xcite from radiocarbon data . to compare with the data",
    ", we applied the same smoothing procedure to our computations as used by @xcite first , amplitudes of magnetic cycles were estimated as maxima of the running annual mean of the @xmath107-parameter ( [ 22 ] ) for distinct cycles of the dynamo model .",
    "next , the smoothed amplitude @xmath109 was estimated by averaging over five neighboring cycles using the gleisberg s filter 1 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 1 .",
    "the time series of the resulting @xmath109 values is shown in fig.[f7 ] together with the original @xmath106-parameter of eq.([21 ] ) .",
    "two horizontal lines in the bottom panel of this figure show the levels of transition to grand minima ( below the lower line ) and maxima ( above the upper line ) .",
    "the levels are defined by the conditions that the system spends 17% of the time in states of grand minima and 9% - in global maxima @xcite .",
    "statistics of grand minima is illustrated by fig.[f8 ] .",
    "the histogram of durations of grand minima shows two groups of relatively short ( 30 - 90 years duration ) and relatively long ( @xmath110110 years ) events .",
    "the two groups can be identified with the mauder - type and sprer - type minima revealed in the radiocarbon data @xcite .",
    "figure[f8](b ) shows the distribution of expectation times of grand minima , i.e. , the probability of expecting the next global minimum longer than a given time as a function of this time .",
    "the probability ( @xmath111 ) can be roughly approximated by the exponential law @xmath112 corresponding to the poisson random process .",
    "the exponential fit suggests that occurrence of each next minimum is statistically independent of the previous one .",
    "magnetic fields are evolved continuously with time in the dynamo process .",
    "dynamo , therefore , has a finite memory",
    ". the memory time would be indefinitely long if random fluctuations were absent .",
    "the fluctuations , however , destroy the memory to reduce its characteristic time , probably , to the diffusion time @xmath113 which is of the order of the magnetic cycle period in our model .",
    "recently @xcite explored and clarified the memory issue for the solar dynamo .",
    "they showed that in the diffusion - dominated regime , to which our model belongs , the memory extends to about one solar cycle only .",
    "downward diamagnetic pumping shortens somewhat the memory still further @xcite .",
    "expectation times of the global minima are typically much longer than the magnetic cycle period .",
    "the subsequent minima , therefore , occur almost independently , as the radiocarbon data also suggest @xcite .",
    "the results of only one but representative run have been discussed so far .",
    "several other runs for varying dynamo number were performed .",
    "the global minima become shorter and eventually disappear as the number increases .",
    "we believe that the slightly supercritical number @xmath114 is a reasonable choice for the sun .",
    "rotation of solar - type stars is not decelerated beyond a maximum rotation period depending on spectral type @xcite .",
    "the maximum period probably corresponds to the rotation rate where global dynamos and angular momentum loss for stellar wind cease .",
    "the solar rotation period is only slightly shorter than the maximum period observed for g2 dwarfs @xcite .",
    "only old slowly rotating stars show global minima of magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "the model of this paper differs from previous dynamo - models with fluctuating dynamo - parameters by allowance for random dependence of the fluctuations on latitude .",
    "amplitude of the fluctuations in the poloidal field generation mechanism was prescribed after its estimation from sunspot statistics .",
    "when the random fluctuations are neglected , the model describes an oscillating global field of dipolar parity similar to the fields of recent solar cycles .",
    "latitude - dependence of the fluctuations violates equatorial symmetry of the dynamo - field .",
    "when the deviations from dipolar parity are relatively large , the model typically shows decreased amplitude of magnetic cycles . the model , therefore , predicts the increased north - south asymmetry of magnetic activity to be a characteristic feature of grand minima .",
    "the high correlation of decreased amplitude of magnetic cycles with deviations from dipolar parity in the dynamo model is explained by the dynamo being subcritical to excitation of quadrupolar fields .",
    "the explanation implies that the rotation rate of the sun is not much faster than the critical rate for the onset of a global dynamo .    the statistical distribution of expectation times of the modelled grand minima is closely approximated by exponential law .",
    "this indicates that the occurrence of grand minima is close to the poisson - type random process with each subsequent minimum statistically independent on preceding minima .",
    "this is similar to the conclusion of @xcite based on radiocarbon data on global minima occurrence over the holocene .",
    "randomness in the poloidal field generation mechanism reduces the memory time of the dynamo process , which becomes shorter than the characteristic expectation time of grand minima .",
