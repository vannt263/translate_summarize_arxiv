    "molecular wires are molecules that bridge between metallic leads to form a nano - conductor whose current - voltage characteristic reflects the electronic structure of the molecule . the conductance may be controlled via its dependence on molecular properties .",
    "equally important is the use of such molecular junctions as capacitive elements in nano - electronics .    understanding the behavior of such junctions under potential bias is a prerequisite for elucidating their transport properties .",
    "the importance of this issue for the conductance of molecular junctions was recently emphasized by datta and coworkers @xcite , who have shown , within a simple extended - hckel ( eh ) model for @xmath0,@xmath1-xylyl dithiol bridging between two gold leads , that the potential profile ( imposed on the molecule as input to the eh calculation ) had a profound effect on quantitative as well as qualitative aspects of the calculated current - voltage characteristic .",
    "the best fit to experimental results was obtained from a model that assumed ( a ) a flat potential profile in the interior of the molecular bridge , i.e. the potential drop occurs only at the molecule - lead contacts and ( b ) a symmetric distribution of the potential drop at the two contacts , i.e. for a total voltage @xmath2 the potential drops at each molecular edge by @xmath3 .",
    "this picture is supported by a recent model calculation by mujica _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the schrdinger equation ( on the hartree level ) was solved in conjunction with the poisson equation to yield both the electronic structure and the spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential @xcite .",
    "it was found that beyond a screening distance of the order of 13 atomic lengths the potential is flat along the model molecular chain .",
    "ab initio calculations with open system boundary conditions reveal a different picture : lang and avouris @xcite have found for a chain of seven carbon atoms connecting between jellium leads that a substantial part of the voltage drop occurs along the carbon chain itself .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have obtained similar results for a chain of gold atoms as well as for a molecular wire  phenyl - dithiol bridging between two gold electrodes @xcite . in an earlier work , pernas _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have determined that the potential along a model molecular wire is flat in the absence of scattering centers , however these authors have derived the local potential from a questionable local charge neutrality condition .",
    "recently , weber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have considered the voltage profile across 9,10-bis((2-para - mercaptophenyl)-ethinyl)-anthracene coupled to two au@xmath4 clusters .",
    "their density functional theory calculations thus go beyond the assumption of a structureless metallic electrode and take into account the specific properties of the bond between the molecule and the gold atom in its local environment .    on the experimental side ,",
    "bachtold _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have used scanned probe microscopy of both single - walled and multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( swnt and mwnt , respectively ) to measure the potential drop along such nanotubes connecting between two gold electrodes .",
    "they find an approximately linear drop of the potential in a mwnt of diameter 9 nm while for a metallic swnt bundle of diameter 2.5 nm the potential is flat beyond the screening regions at the tube edges .",
    "it should be emphasized that these experiments can not be related directly to the calculations discussed above .",
    "the nanotube length is a few microns and impurity and defect scattering may be effective as is most certainly the case in the mwnt measurement .",
    "the flat potential seen in the metallic swnt measurement is in fact a remarkable observation implying a very long mean free path ( @xmath5 m ) for electrons in these room temperature structures .",
    "it is clear from the studies described above that while the computational methodology for evaluating the potential distribution on a biased molecular wire is available , a complete understanding of the way this distribution behaves in different wires is lacking . in this respect",
    "simple models that focus on generic properties of conducting constrictions including molecular wires are useful . the calculations of pernas _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite provide such a model that is however hampered , as already stated by the restriction of local charge neutrality .",
    "the calculation of mujica _ et al . _",
    "@xcite is also based on a generic molecular model , however , by using a 1-dimensional poisson equation for the electrostatic potential these authors tacitly assume a molecular bridge whose lateral dimension is much larger than the screening length . in view of the fact that the width of molecular wires is often just a few angstroms , such an assumption is overly restrictive .",
    "clearly , the magnitudes of the lateral width of the wire and the screening length should be important generic quantities for this issue . in this paper",
    "we present a simple model calculation that takes the relative magnitudes of these variables explicitly into account .",
    "we describe the model in section [ sec : model ] , present the calculation in section [ sec : potential ] and some results and discussion in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the molecular wire is modeled as a cylinder of length @xmath6 and diameter of order @xmath7 ( the exact way in which @xmath7 enters into the model calculation is explained below ) , perpendicular to and connecting between two planar metal electrode surfaces . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] , the cylinder is oriented parallel to the @xmath8 axis , with its axis going through the origin in the @xmath9 plane .",
    "the two electrodes are assumed to be ideal conductors implying a constant potential on the entire surface of each electrode .",
    "we set the potentials at the left and right wire - electrode interface to be @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . in view of ( [ eq : screening ] ) below",
    ", this guarantees a vanishing mean potential in @xmath8-direction and thus a neutral molecule . finally , we restrict the discussion of the potential profile to blocking junctions between electrodes and molecule so that no current is flowing .",
    "and diameter @xmath7 between two perfect conductors with potentials @xmath12 and @xmath13 . ]    as in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the wire material does have screening capacity , and is characterized by a screening length @xmath14 .",
    "it should be noted that the existence , nature and size of such screening length in molecular systems is an open question with probably non - unique answer .",
    "molecules with large gaps between their highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( homo and lumo ) will obviously screen poorly , while highly conjugated molecules with low homo - lumo gap will screen relatively well .    in the present discussion",
    "we assume that over the relevant length scales ( of order @xmath6 ) screening is described by a poisson equation @xmath15 according to the cylinder symmetry of the molecule , the charge density @xmath16 depends on the radial distance @xmath17 from the wire axis and the position @xmath8 along the wire . in transversal direction ,",
    "the charge density is assumed to be determined by a given molecular electron distribution represented by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "the longitudinal part depends on the potential along the molecular axis .",
    "the screening is then described by @xmath19 which together with ( [ eq : poisson ] ) will allow us to determine the potential profile .",
    "any assumption about the functional form of @xmath18 is in fact an assumption about the confinement of the molecular charge distribution in the molecular cylinder and in our generic model it is sufficient to take a form that reflects the molecular thickness @xmath7 .",
    "other details of @xmath18 are expected to be of secondary importance .    in the three - dimensional thomas fermi model for screening in a gas of electrons with charge @xmath20 and mass @xmath21 , the screening length @xmath14 of ( [ eq : screening ] )",
    "is related to the electron density @xmath22 by @xmath23 with the fermi energy @xmath24 at metallic electron densities @xmath14 is typically of the order of 1 . to have efficient screening in a molecular system electrons ( or holes ) must occupy molecular states that are effectively delocalized over the length of the bridge .",
    "charge doping by transfer from the metal electrode to the molecular bridge may be one source of such electrons .",
    "their density is expected to be considerably lower than metallic , implying a larger characteristic screening length .",
    "we expect that a calculation based on ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and ( [ eq : screening ] ) that uses metallic electron density to estimate @xmath14 will provide an upper bound on the effective screening in a molecular wire .",
    "using the model described in the previous section , our problem is to solve the equation @xmath25 in the range @xmath26 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath27 it is convenient to decompose the full potential @xmath28 into a first term describing the bare potential @xmath29 in the absence of a molecule and a second term which reflects the additional potential @xmath30 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting differential equation @xmath32\\ ] ] may be solved by the fourier ansatz @xmath33 after expressing the bare potential profile in terms of a fourier series one arrives at @xmath34}\\hat f(k_{\\parallel})\\\\ & \\qquad\\times\\left[\\delta\\frac{1+(-1)^n}{\\pi n } + \\int\\frac{d^2k_{\\parallel } ' } { ( 2\\pi)^2}\\hat\\phi_n(k_{\\parallel}')\\right ] \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : phift}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 for the potential profile along the molecular axis , only the transversal integral over the fourier coefficients @xmath36 is needed which may easily be obtained from ( [ eq : phift ] ) . due to the symmetry of the bare potential only even fourier coefficients are found to contribute .",
    "we thus arrive at our main result describing the potential profile along the molecule @xmath37 the coefficients @xmath38 accounting for the influence of screening are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes a modified bessel function . in the limit of very small screening length , @xmath41 , it is possible to show by evaluating the sum in ( [ eq : phi00zf ] ) that the potential along the wire vanishes and the entire voltage drop occurs at the interface with the electrodes .    for the following discussion , it is convenient to introduce a measure of the deviation of the voltage profile @xmath42 from the linear behavior ( [ eq : phi0 ] ) . since the integral over @xmath43 vanishes for a neutral molecule , we use instead @xmath44^{1/2}\\;. \\label{eq : deltadef}\\ ] ] this quantity is normalized such that it equals 1 if the voltage drop occurs entirely at the ends of the molecule while it vanishes for a linear potential profile . employing ( [ eq : phi00zf ] ) , one may express @xmath45 in terms of the coefficients defined by ( [ eq : fn ] ) as @xmath46^{1/2}\\;. \\label{eq : delta}\\ ] ]",
    "we now address the dependence of the potential profile on the width of the molecular wire and start with the limiting case of an infinitely thick molecule or , equivalently , a large number of molecules in parallel present between the two electrodes .",
    "then , @xmath47 and one finds from ( [ eq : fn ] ) @xmath48 using @xmath49 ( [ eq : phi00zf ] ) yields for the potential profile @xmath50 the deviation from the linear voltage drop can be quantified by inserting ( [ eq : fninf ] ) into ( [ eq : delta ] ) . evaluating the sum",

    "[ fig : delta ] as uppermost curve . in the limit of very large screening length , @xmath52",
    ", @xmath45 vanishes , thereby indicating the expected linear voltage drop . on the other hand , for very short screening length , @xmath41 , @xmath45 approaches one and the entire voltage drops at the interfaces between wire and electrode .",
    "( [ eq : deltadef ] ) ) of the voltage profile from the linear behavior is shown as a function of the ratio of wire length @xmath6 and screening length @xmath14 .",
    "the four curves correspond to @xmath53 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : deltainf ] ) ) , @xmath54 and @xmath55 from the upper to the lower curve . ]    for the case of finite width , we employ the gaussian charge distribution @xmath56 this function is not normalized and therefore describes a charge distribution with a density in the center independent of the width @xmath7 .",
    "such a situation arises when the diameter of a molecular layer can be controlled .",
    "then , the charge density in the center appears in the screening length @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , in the somewhat unrealistic case where the charge density on the wire is changed , the function @xmath18 would have to be normalized .",
    "one advantage of the gaussian distribution ( [ eq : gaussian ] ) is the fact that the coefficients ( [ eq : fn ] ) may still be expressed analytically in terms of an exponential integral @xmath57 with @xmath58 with this result the potential profile can be evaluated numerically according to ( [ eq : phi00zf ] ) while the deviation from the linear voltage drop is obtained from ( [ eq : delta ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] , the deviation @xmath45 of the voltage profile from the linear behavior ( [ eq : phi0 ] ) is shown for different values of the wire thickness @xmath7 .",
    "the uppermost curve corresponds to the limit of a thick molecular layer @xmath53 which was discussed above .",
    "the three other curves correspond to @xmath59 and @xmath55 from top to bottom .",
    "as these results demonstrate , a reduction of @xmath7 causes a reduction of @xmath45 indicating that the voltage profile approaches the linear voltage drop .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of a reduction of screening due to the reduced molecular layer . however",
    ", this effect becomes only relevant for @xmath60 .",
    "as discussed above , the limit @xmath41 leads to a constant potential along the molecular wire .",
    "therefore , all curves shown in fig .  [ fig : delta ] tend to @xmath61 in this limit even though this is not shown in the figure .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of the voltage profiles themselves .",

    "the thickness parameter @xmath66 for the three different curves are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where the voltage profile becomes more and more linear as @xmath7 decreases .",

    "the friedel oscillations found in the quantum calculation can not be obtained within our classical approach . in a tight - binding model description of the molecular wire ,",
    "friedel oscillations naturally arise from a breaking of electron - hole symmetry @xcite . secondly , the systematic shift between the two voltage profiles in fig .  [ fig3 ] indicates that the wire in the ab initio calculation was charged while our wire is always assumed to be neutral .    )",

    "it is obvious from these results that the ratio of the wire thickness to the screening length does constitute an important generic attribute that determines the general behavior of the potential bias distribution along a molecular wire .",
    "the relatively good fit obtained between the model calculations and the ab initio results for a chain of gold atoms using reasonable geometric parameters supports this conclusion .",
    "we note in passing that the flat potential distribution observed @xcite for metallic single walled carbon nanotubes of thickness @xmath77 is consistent with the results shown in fig .",
    "one should keep in mind however that apart from its intrinsic simplicity , the model used in this work suffers from two important shortcomings .",
    "firstly , the use of a simple screening property as described by ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and ( [ eq : screening ] ) can not be justified for all molecules , and certainly not for arbitrary distances .",
    "even when such screening applies , the magnitude of the screening parameter @xmath14 is not known and is expected to depend on the amount of equilibrium charge transfer between the wire and the metal leads . secondly , a complete calculation of the potential profile along a molecular junction should take into account the fact that some of this drop may take place on the metal leads near the junction .",
    "such a behavior was found in the calculation of ref .",
    "the potential distribution along molecular wires in biased molecular junctions is determined in principle by the detailed electronic structure of the wire and by the response of this structure to the molecule - lead contacts and to the bias .",
    "the present study has identified the wire thickness as one of two generic attributes that largely determine the way the potential drops along the wire . increasing this parameter leads to a crossover from a three - dimensional electrostatic problem to an effectively one - dimensional situation .",
    "the accompanying increase in screening causes a transition from a linear potential profile to a situation where the potential drops mostly at the interfaces between wire and electrode . the other ,",
    "less accessible molecular property is its ability to screen a local charge . in the present model calculation",
    "we have used a simple screening length parameter to model this molecular property , but further studies are needed for a better characterization of this property .",
