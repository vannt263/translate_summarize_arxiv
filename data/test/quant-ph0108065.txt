    "the physics of quantum computation and information [ 2 ] is one of the branch of quantum theory , which develops day by day very fast .",
    "a lot of proposals [ 2 ] have been proposed for the construction of quantum computer .",
    "most reliable , some of them [ 2 ] are optical quantum computer ( oqc ) , ion - trap , and solid - state quantum computer ( ssqc ) .",
    "the most prospective technique to construct quantum computer among them is ssqc .",
    "so , througuhout this paper , we will discuss the oqc and ssqc .",
    "our dream to see the power , possibilities and applications of quantum computer is still under process .",
    "the reason for comparing the oqc with ssqc is that the coherent optical computers [ 1,6,7 ] which come around 1960 were studied very extensively in usa for their millitary purposes .",
    "the coherent optical computers were constructed with the huge amount of optical instruments and were useful for very limited number of problems .",
    "after the invention of the maser , the requirement [ 1 ] for coherent optical computer starts increasing very fast with more requirements of linear and nonlinear optical instruments .",
    "moreover , the applications , possibilities of coherent optical computer were very limited as compare to the digital computer based on silicon .",
    "so , the coherent optical computers lost their interest [ 6 - 8 ] due to the huge amount of requirements and limited number of applications . in the begining of 1990 ,",
    "oqc [ 2,3,5,9 ] were proposed . in this article",
    ", we are studying the main technical requirements to construct oqc and comparing with ssqc .",
    "moreover , firstly , we are proposing to construct oqc based on rds crystals [ 4 ] .",
    "the ssqc consists [ 2 ] of @xmath1 number of atoms in one molecule .",
    "why we are taking one molecule and why not two or three ?",
    "the reason for taking one molecule is that the interaction within the molecules are negligible as compare to interaction of atoms in each molecule .",
    "some of the atoms in each molecule have nuclear spins @xmath2 with slightly different resonance frequencies .",
    "to have an idea of ssqc , we will demonstrate the graphical representation of ssqc and how to perform logical operations on it .",
    "as an example we are taking one molecule having two atoms and each atom having nuclear spin @xmath2 and resonance frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the two spins are interacting with each other with hyperfine interaction @xmath5 .",
    "to start , the implementation of some quantum algorithm , firstly , we align the two nuclear spins of each molecule along the direction of constant magnetic field @xmath6 , which is applied along the @xmath7-axis .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system of two nuclear spins @xmath2 with hyperfine interaction @xmath5 [ 2 ] @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the pauli matrices of nuclear spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 . the logical operations are performed by the time dependent unitary operator @xmath13 we can change the dyanamics and position of spins @xmath14 and @xmath15 by selecting different resonance frequency impulses [ 2 ] .      recently , it is shown that for the implementation of quantum algorithms on quantum computer , only two quantum logical gates ( not and cnot ) [ 2 ] are needed .",
    "it means that the complex quantum algorithms can be executed on quantum computer with the combination of quantum logical gates not and cnot ( control - not ) .",
    "the true tables for quantum logical gates not and cnot are as follows    truth tables for logic gates not and cnot :     input & output & & input & input & output & output + @xmath16 & @xmath17 & & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 + 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 + & & & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 + & & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 +    where bar over @xmath22 and sign @xmath23 denote the not operation and summation modulo @xmath24 .      1 .",
    "@xmath25-number of qubits ( quantum bits ) are required to operate and store data .",
    "2 .   to prepare the system ( qubits ) to its initial state i.e.",
    ", constant magnetic field is required to align the initial spin states along the magnetic field direction .",
    "3 .   to isolate the quantum computer ( qubits ) from the environment ( decoherence effect ) [ 10 ] , which is practically uncntrollable part of the quantum computer .",
    "4 .   unitary transformations to implement quantum algorithms i.e. , for the implementations of quantum algorithms .",
    "5 .   quantum measurements [ 10 ] , which are needed for measuring the final state of the implemented quantum algorithms .      there are two proposals [ 2,3,5,9 ] to construct oqc on the basis of linear optics and nonlinear optics .",
    "the linear optics means that we need coherent laser beams , polarization beam splitters ( pbs ) , polarization rotating plates , optical mirrors , photo - detectors etc . for the case of nonlinear optics we need nonlinear crystals and all the components of the linear optics .",
    "the proposal to construct oqc based on linear optics was given by spreeuw [ 9 ] . to perform quantum computation on oqc for the general case ,",
    "we need exponentially amount of linear optical components .",
    "for example to have @xmath26 qubits as in the case of ssqc , we need at least @xmath26 number of optical components to have properties like ssqc at least . the exponentially number of components can be reduced by using polarized states ( jones matrices ) of light .",
    "the oqc @xmath27 qubits can be represented by @xmath28 polarized light modes i.e. , @xmath29 jones matrices [ 9 ] .",
    "but in ssqc we need @xmath30 nuclear spins to have @xmath31 quantum states .",
    "pbs are required for separating horizontal and vertical polarization components of the laser mode .      for performing the logical operations . for example , the logical operations not and cnot can be implemented by using the pbs .      mathematically , linear optics logical gates can be constructed by using @xmath32 and @xmath33 algebra [ 3 ] .",
    "experimentally , it can be constructed by rotating the pbs ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the proposal to construct logical gates based on nonlinear optics is given by milburn [ 6,2 ] .",
    "this oqc uses nonlinear crystal to get the squeezed states of light ( ssl ) . as we know",
    "the ssl has antibunching property i.e. , the photons are uniformally distrubuted as compared to the coherent state of light . by using the antibunching property of ssl",
    ", this computer can      in the case of ssl , the role of qubits perform the photons of ssl i.e. , each photon of ssl represents , one optical qubit based on nonlinear optics .      to operate on each photon qubit , we need photo - detectors with high quantum efficieny , which are our dream of future .",
    "moreover , in quantum mechanics , we detect the average number of physical quantities .",
    "it means , we do not have @xmath34 gurantee that we have detected the concrete photon , which we planned .",
    "again , we need the beam splitters to perform the logical operations , which are highly noisy .",
    "oqc can be constructed at least on one nonlinear crystal .",
    "it means that @xmath1 number of laser beams are propagating through one nonlinear crytal ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . why we are using nonlinear crystal",
    "? there are some advantages to use nonlinear crytals :    1 .",
    "logical gates ( not and cnot ) can be performed by using the rds ( regular domain structure ) crystals . 2 .",
    "we can use the property of squeezed states of light , i.e. , the quantum noise is less as compare to the coherent state of light .",
    "3 .   rds crystals are independent on heating [ 4 ] of the crystals .",
    "we can use this crystal without any cooling process , which will not delay our computation process .",
    "4 .    .",
    "there are two ways to perform the logical operations in rds crystals .    1 .   by using the properties of bistable switches i.e.",
    ", the logical switch starts working when the intensity of the coherent laser beam ( fundamental mode ) propagating through the rds crystal starts producing the predefined intensity of harmonic generation for some concrete logical operation .",
    "2 .   since",
    ", the rds crystals can produce at a time multiple number of harmonic modes .",
    "we can predefine each harmonic for logic operations .",
    "for example , we can predefind second harmonic generation for not and third harmonic generation for cnot logical operations .",
    "if we will compare the properties of ssqc and oqc , we can conclude that the future of oqc is practically absent .",
    "due to the requirement of huge number of optical components ( linear and nonlinear ) , heating of the linear and nonlinear crystals and quantum noise is greater than the coherent state of light .",
    "the proposal which we have offered i.e. , the construction of oqc on rds crytals require less number of components as compare to linear and nonlinear ( ordinary ) crystals . moreover",
    ", we can construct the logical gates on one rds crytals with lesser quantum noise , because we are performing all the logic operations in it as compare to the linear and nonlinear crystals [ 2,3,5,9 ] .",
    "so , the oqc based on rds is more realistic as compare to other proposals to construct oqc .",
