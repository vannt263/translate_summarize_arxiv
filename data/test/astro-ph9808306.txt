    "udalski et al .",
    "1997 ; alard & guibert 1997 ) are detecting massive astrophysical compact objects ( machos ) by monitoring the light variations of stars undergoing gravitational microlensing .",
    "the light curve of a microlensing event is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath5^{1/2 } , \\eqno(1.1)\\ ] ] where a is the magnification , @xmath6 is the lens - source separation , @xmath7 is the impact parameter , @xmath8 is the time of maximum amplification , and @xmath9 is the einstein ring radius crossing time ( einstein timescale ) . of these lensing parameters ,",
    "only the timescale provides information about the lens because it is the only one directly related to the physical parameters of the lens ( lens parameters ) by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lens - source transverse speed , @xmath12 is the physical size of the einstein ring radius , @xmath13 is the mass of the lens , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are the separations between the observer , lens , and source star .",
    "however , due to the degeneracy in the lens parameters , the nature of the lens population is still very uncertain .",
    "the uncertainties in the lens parameters can be significantly reduced if one can measure the lens proper motion , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the angular einstein ring radius .",
    "the lens proper motions can be measured both photometrically ( gould 1994 ; nemiroff & wickramasinghe 1994 ; witt & mao 1994 ) and spectroscopically ( maoz & gould 1994 ; loeb & sasselov 1995 ) .",
    "however , measuring the proper motion with either of these techniques is only possible for several special classes of lensing events .",
    "the lens proper motions can be measured in a general way if the separation between the two source star images can be measured .",
    "as this image separation is generally on order @xmath19 , it can not be measured with current instrumentation . however , the proposed",
    "_ space interferometry mission _",
    "( allen , shao , & peterson 1997 , hereafter sim ) will have high enough positional accuracy to measure the astrometric displacement in the light centroid caused by gravitational microlensing ( walker 1995 ; h-1pt g , novikov & polnarev 1995 ; paczyski 1998 ; boden , shao , & van buren 1998 ) . the astrometric shift of the source star image centroid is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes represent the directions which are parallel and normal to the lens - source transverse motion , respectively .",
    "the trajectory of the apparent source star image traces out an ellipse during the event ( astrometric ellipse , jeong , han , & park 1998 ) . with the measured astrometric ellipse",
    ", one can determine the impact parameter of the event because the shape ( i.e. the axis ratio ) of the ellipse is related to the impact parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the importance of measuring the astrometric centroid shifts is that one can then determine the angular einstein ring radius as the size of the astrometric ellipse , i.e. , the semimajor axis , is directly proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "once the angular einstein ring radius is determined from the astrometric shifts , one can determine the lens proper motion from @xmath24 combined with the event timescale , which is determined from photometric monitoring of the event .",
    "since astrometric centroid shifts of microlensing events exhibit various shapes depending on the combination of the lensing parameters , i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , and @xmath24 , the uncertainties in the astrometrically determined values of the angular einstein ring radius , @xmath0 , will depend on the lensing parameters .",
    "the values of the lensing parameters @xmath9 and @xmath24 are related to the physical parameters of lenses , @xmath14 , @xmath11 , and @xmath13 , and thus the uncertainties will also depend on the lens parameters .",
    "in addition , due to the differences in the lens parameters for different types of lensing events , the expected values of @xmath0 for lmc events will be different from those of galactic bulge events . as a result",
    ", the expected uncertainties of @xmath24 will have a wide range .",
    "boden , shao , & van buren ( 1998 ) performed a detailed study of the performance of the astrometric observations of gravitational microlensing events in determining various observables , including @xmath24 . from this analysis",
    ", they demonstrated the usefulness of astrometric observations of lensing events in determining the lens parameters . in their analysis , however , boden et al .",
    "( 1998 ) considered only lmc events , while the majority of events are detected toward the galactic bulge .",
    "in addition , their estimate of the uncertainties is based on the very limited number of test cases they considered .",
    "for example , all of the events they considered had a fixed lens location of @xmath25 , and their only values for the einstein timescale and impact parameter were @xmath26 and 0.2 yr and @xmath27 and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "they also did not take into account the restriction the source star brightness can impose on astrometric observations .",
    "therefore , one can not make general conclusions about the usefulness of astrometrically monitoring lensing events based on their analysis alone .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the applicability of the astrometric method to the determination of the lens parameters for events toward both the lmc and the galactic bulge . for this analysis",
    ", we investigate the dependency of @xmath0 on the lens parameters by testing various types of events .",
    "in addition , by computing @xmath0 for events with the most probable lensing parameters for a given lens mass under the standard models of the galactic matter density and velocity distributions , we determine the expected distribution of the uncertainties in @xmath24 as a function of a lens mass . from this study , we find that the values of the angular einstein ring radius are expected to be measured with uncertainties @xmath1 up to the lens mass of @xmath2 for both galactic disk - bulge and halo - lmc events with a moderate observational strategy .",
    "the uncertainties are relatively large for galactic bulge - bulge self - lensing events , @xmath3 for @xmath2 , but they can be substantially reduced by adopting more aggressive observational strategies .",
    "we also find that although astrometric observations can be performed for most photometrically detected galactic bulge events , a significant fraction ( @xmath4 ) of lmc events can not be astrometrically observed due to the faintness of their source stars .",
    "to show the applicability of the astrometric method to the determination of @xmath24 , we begin our analysis by investigating how the uncertainties in an astrometrically determined @xmath24 changes with respect to varying lens parameters . we determine the uncertainties in @xmath24 by conducting model fits to the astrometric shifts of simulated events with various lensing parameters .",
    "the result of the fit is obtained by computing @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 ^ 2 + \\left[\\delta\\theta_{c , y}(t_i)-\\delta\\theta_{c0,y}(t_i)\\right]^2 \\right\\ } , \\eqno(2.1)\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the number of the astrometric observations and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the centroid shifts of the simulated and model events , respectively . following the mission specifications of sim",
    ", we adopt the positional accuracy of the astrometric measurements to be @xmath33 ( http://huey.jpl.nasa.gov/sim ) . since our goal is to see the variation of @xmath0 with respect to individual lensing parameters ,",
    "the uncertainties are determined under fixed but realistic observational conditions .",
    "we will discuss the expected uncertainties under other observational conditions in   4 . to determine the uncertainties , we assume that the astrometric centroid shifts of events are measured with a frequency @xmath34 during @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the times of the first and last astrometric measurements . since the astrometric observations will be performed for events that are photometrically detected , we set @xmath38 while @xmath39 .",
    "the uncertainties are determined by the @xmath40 level , which is equivalent to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the best - fitting @xmath28 value . to illustrate the sensitivity of this uncertainty on the lens parameters",
    ", we have tested a sample event with lensing parameters @xmath43 .",
    "then the dependency of the uncertainty on each lensing parameter is obtained by varying the parameter of interest while holding the other lensing parameters constant .    in figure 1 , we present the uncertainties of the astrometrically determined angular einstein ring radius with respect to various lensing parameters . from the figure , one finds that the uncertainties increase significantly with decreasing angular einstein ring radius and decreasing einstein timescale . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependency of @xmath44 on the impact parameter is negligible .",
    "in the previous section we showed that the uncertainty @xmath0 depends strongly on the size of the angular einstein ring radius and the duration of the einstein timescale . since both @xmath24 and @xmath9 are related to the mass of the lens , the strong dependency of @xmath44 on @xmath24 and @xmath9 implies that the uncertainties for events caused by different populations of lenses will be greatly different .",
    "then the naturally arising questions are :  is the astrometric observation of lensing events a guaranteed method of determining @xmath24 ? \" and if not , `` to what extent can one determine @xmath24 with this method ? '' to answer these questions , one must determine the expected value of @xmath44 as a function of lens mass .",
    "we determine the relation between @xmath0 and the lens mass by computing the uncertainties for events with lensing parameters which are the most probable for a given lens mass . because the values of @xmath24 and @xmath9 also depend on the lens parameters @xmath11 and @xmath14",
    ", there is no one - to - one correspondence between the lens mass and the lensing parameters .",
    "however , with models of the galactic matter density and velocity distributions , one can statistically determine the most probable values of the lensing parameters corresponding to individual lens masses .    with models for the galactic matter density and velocity distributions , the distributions of @xmath9 and @xmath24 for a given lens mass @xmath13",
    "are obtained by @xmath45 @xmath46 , \\eqno(3.1)\\ ] ] for the einstein timescale and @xmath47 @xmath48 , \\eqno(3.2)\\ ] ] for the angular einstein ring radius . here",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 are the density distributions of lens and source stars , @xmath51 is the delta function , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the components of the transverse velocity @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is their distribution . in the above equations , the factors @xmath56 and @xmath11 are included because events with larger cross - sections and higher transverse speeds are more likely to occur . for galactic bulge events ( disk - bulge plus bulge - bulge self - lensing events ) ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the velocity components which are normal and azimuthal to the galactic plane , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "since we adopt a non - rotating isotropic velocity model for lmc events ( halo - lmc events , see table 1 ) , these variables represent two velocity components of arbitrary direction in the plane normal to the line of sight toward the lmc .",
    "we assume that the individual components of the transverse velocities have gaussian distributions of the form @xmath57,\\qquad i\\in \\ { y , z\\}. \\eqno(3.3)\\ ] ] the values of the mean , @xmath58 , and the dispersion , @xmath59 , of the velocity distributions , which are listed in table 1 , are adopted from the models of han & gould ( 1995 ) for the galactic bulge events and from han & gould ( 1996 ) for the lmc events . for the matter",
    "density distributions of the individual galactic components , we adopt an axisymmetric model ( kent 1992 ) for the galactic bulge , a double - exponential disk model ( bahcall 1986 ) for the galactic disk , and an isothermal sphere model with a core radius ( bahcall , schmidt , & soneira 1983 ) for the galactic halo .",
    "the adopted models of the matter density distributions are listed in table 2 .",
    "the adopted distances to the galactic center and to the lmc are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .    in figure 2",
    ", we present the expected distribution of @xmath62 and @xmath63 for various types of events and different values of lens mass . from the figure , one can see that the expected distribution for a given type of event covers a wide range , considering the variety of lens populations and corresponding lens masses .",
    "in addition , even with a fixed lens mass , the distributions for different types of events are substantially different from each other .",
    "therefore , the analysis of @xmath44 based on limited sets of lensing parameters for only a single type of lensing events will lead to erroneous conclusions about the general applicability of the astrometric method to the determination of @xmath24 .",
    "once the most probable values of @xmath24 and @xmath9 for a given lens mass are obtained from their distributions , the expected values of @xmath64 are determined as before , by carrying out a @xmath28 fit to the astrometric centroid shifts of the event with the most probable lensing parameters . since the dependency of the uncertainties on the impact parameter is not important , we assume @xmath65 for all simulated events",
    ". the astrometric centroid shifts of the events are assumed to be measured under moderate observational conditions with a frequency @xmath66 during @xmath67 and with a positional accuracy of @xmath68 .",
    "then , the relation between @xmath64 and lens mass is obtained by repeating the uncertainty determinations for different lens masses .    in figure 3 , we present the resulting relation between the lens mass and the expected uncertainty in the astrometrically determined values of @xmath24 .",
    "we find that the angular einstein ring radii are expected to be measured with uncertainties @xmath1 up to the lens mass of @xmath2 for both galactic disk - bulge and halo - lmc events . for galactic bulge - bulge self - lensing events ,",
    "the uncertainty is relatively large : @xmath3 for @xmath2 .",
    "up to now , we have investigated the uncertainties @xmath44 for a fixed observational strategy . in this section",
    ", we investigate the dependency of the uncertainties on observational strategies to find the optimal astrometric observational strategies for better determinations of @xmath24 .",
    "the accuracy of the astrometric determination of @xmath24 can be broadly improved in three ways .",
    "first of all , the uncertainties will be decreased if the astrometric positional accuracy can be improved . however , since the positional accuracy is restricted by the instrumentation and not by the observational strategy , we do not consider this scenario further .",
    "secondly , the accuracy can be improved by increasing the duration of the astrometric observations .",
    "finally , increasing the frequency of astrometric observation will also help to improve the accuracy in determining @xmath24 .    in figure 4 , we present the uncertainties as functions of the frequency ( upper panel ) and the duration ( lower panel ) of the astrometric measurements of @xmath69 . the uncertainties are obtained for an example event with a set of lensing parameters @xmath70 under various observational conditions . from the figure",
    ", one finds that the accuracy improves significantly with increasing observational frequencies .",
    "longer observations of the event also contribute to decrease the uncertainty of @xmath24 determination .",
    "however , observations longer than @xmath71 do not help to a significant reduction of the uncertainty .    as we know that measuring @xmath69 with increased frequency will help to improve the accuracy in determining @xmath24 , we re - determined the relation between @xmath44 and the lens mass for a new observational strategy with @xmath72 . since we already tested the uncertainties for a long enough observational duration of @xmath73 , we only increased the observational frequency for this test . in figure 2 , we present the newly determined @xmath44-@xmath13 relation ( represented by a thick solid line ) for the galactic bulge - bulge self - lensing events , which have the largest uncertainties among the various types of events .",
    "one finds that the accuracy of the @xmath24 determination significantly improves ",
    "the uncertainty decreases by approximately one - half over the entire range of lens masses .",
    "the applicability of the astrometric method in determining lens parameters is additionally restricted by source star brightness because the astrometric observations will only be possible for events with bright source stars .",
    "for both the galactic bulge and lmc fields , the photometric monitoring of source stars is restricted by crowding .",
    "current microlensing experiments toward the galactic bulge reach the photometric detection limit when the stellar density of the fields arrives at @xmath74 ( c. alcock 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "based on the model luminosity function of han ( 1997 ) , this corresponds to @xmath75 , which approximately coincides with the astrometric detection limit of sim ( @xmath76 , http://huey.jpl.nasa.gov/sim ) .",
    "therefore , the astrometric observations of microlensing events can be achieved for most of the photometrically detected galactic bulge events . by using the @xmath77-band luminosity function provided by gould ( 1998 )",
    ", we also determine the fraction of lmc events with source stars bright enough for astrometric observation . with the photometric determination limit of @xmath78 ( alcock et al .",
    "1997b ) , which corresponds to @xmath79 , we find that nearly half ( @xmath4 ) of lmc source stars are fainter than the astrometric detection limit ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this implies that for lmc events the major restriction in the general applicability of the astrometric @xmath24 determination comes from the faintness of the source stars and not from the large uncertainties in the determined values of @xmath24 .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the effectiveness of astrometric monitoring of gravitational microlensing events in determining the lens parameters .",
    "the main results from this analysis can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the uncertainties of the astrometrically determined angular einstein ring radii are strongly dependent on the values of @xmath24 and @xmath9 for the events . however , the dependency of @xmath44 on the impact parameter is not important .",
    "the distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath9 for events caused by various populations of lenses cover wide ranges .",
    "even with a fixed lens mass , the distributions for different types of lensing events are substantially different from each other .",
    "therefore , the analysis of @xmath44 based on limited sets of lensing parameters for only a single type of lensing events will lead to erroneous conclusions about the general applicability of the astrometric method in determining lens parameters .",
    "3 .   measurements of @xmath69 with increased frequencies during longer times of observations help to improve the accuracy of @xmath24 determination .",
    "however , measurements longer than @xmath71 do not contribute to a significant reduction in @xmath44 .",
    "4 .   with a moderate observational strategy",
    ", the value of @xmath24 can be determined with an uncertainty @xmath81 up to a lens mass of @xmath2 for the galactic disk - bulge and halo - lmc events .",
    "the uncertainties for the galactic bulge - bulge self - lensing events is relatively large with @xmath82 for @xmath2 .",
    "however , the uncertainty can be reduced substantially by adopting a more aggressive observational strategy .",
    "5 .   astrometric observations will be possible for most photometrically detected galactic bulge events .",
    "however , nearly half of lmc events will not be astrometrically observable due to the faintness of their source stars .",
    "therefore , for lmc events the major restriction in the general applicability of the astrometric determination of @xmath24 comes from the source star brightness and not from the large uncertainties in the determined value of @xmath24 .",
