    "@xcite have briefly discussed the possible application of sliding mode control to quantum systems . in @xcite ,",
    "two approaches based on sliding mode design have been proposed for the control of quantum systems and potential applications of sliding mode control to quantum information processing have been presented . following these results , this",
    "paper formally presents a sliding mode control method for two - level quantum systems to deal with bounded uncertainties in the system hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in particular , we propose two approaches of designing the measurement period for different situations which are dependent on the bound on the uncertainties and the allowed probability of failure",
    ".    variable structure control design with sliding modes generally includes two main steps : selecting a sliding surface ( sliding mode ) and controlling the system to and maintaining it in this sliding surface . being in the sliding surface guarantees that the quantum system has the desired dynamics .",
    "we will select an eigenstate of the free hamiltonian of the controlled quantum system as a sliding mode . in the second step , direct feedback control is not directly applicable since we generally can not acquire state information without destroying the quantum system s state .",
    "hence , we propose a new method to accomplish this task , which is based on the lyapunov methodology and periodic projective measurements .",
    "the lyapunov methodology is a powerful tool for designing control laws in classical control theory and has also been applied to quantum control problems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most existing results on lyapunov control of quantum systems focus on designing a control law to ensure that the controlled quantum system s state asymptotically converges to the target state .",
    "the existing lyapunov design methods in quantum control rely on perfect knowledge of the initial quantum states and system hamiltonian . in our approach ,",
    "once the lyapunov control steers the quantum system into a sliding mode domain , we make a projective measurement on the system .",
    "hence , the lyapunov design method can tolerate small drifts ( uncertainties ) when carrying out our control tasks , which will be demonstrated by simulation in section ii.c .",
    "periodic projective measurements are employed to maintain the system s state in the sliding mode domain when uncertainties exist in the system hamiltonian .",
    "if the measurement period is small enough and the initial state is an eigenstate , the frequent measurements make the system collapse back to the initial state .",
    "this is related to the quantum zeno effect ( for details , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the quantum zeno effect , our objective is to design a measurement period which is as large as possible .",
    "the framework of the proposed method involves unitary control ( lyapunov control ) and projective measurement . in this sense",
    ", it is similar to the discrete - time quantum feedback stabilization problem in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , these papers do not consider possible uncertainties in the system hamiltonian and use generalized measurements rather than periodic projective measurements .",
    "the main feature of the proposed method is that the control law can guarantee control performance when bounded uncertainties exist in the system hamiltonian .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] introduces a quantum control model , defines the sliding mode and formulates the control problem . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we present a sliding mode control method based on the lyapunov methodology and periodic projective measurements for two - level quantum systems with bounded uncertainties . using the known information about uncertainties ( e.g. , the uncertainty bound and type of uncertainties ) , we propose two approaches ( i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ 1period ] ) and ( [ 2period ] ) ) for designing the measurement period to guarantee the control performance .",
    "an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the proposed method .",
    "the detailed proofs of the main theorems are presented in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "in this section , we first introduce a two - level quantum control model . then a sliding mode is defined using an eigenstate . finally the control problem considered in this paper is formulated .      in this paper , we focus on two - level pure - state quantum systems . the quantum state can be represented by a two - dimensional unit vector @xmath1 in a hilbert space @xmath2 . since the global phase of a quantum state has no observable physical effect , we do not consider the effect of global phase .",
    "if we denote the pauli matrices @xmath3 as follows : @xmath4 we may select the free hamiltonian of the two - level quantum system as @xmath5 .",
    "its two eigenstates are denoted as @xmath6 and @xmath7 . to control a quantum system ,",
    "we introduce the following control hamiltonian @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a set of time - independent hamiltonians . for simplicity",
    ", the control hamiltonian for two - level systems can be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12    the controlled dynamical equation can be described as ( we have assumed @xmath13 by using atomic units in this paper ) @xmath14 this control problem is converted into the following problem : given an initial state and a target state , find a set of controls @xmath15 in ( [ controlled model ] ) to drive the controlled system from the initial state to the target state .    in practical applications",
    ", we often use the density operator ( or density matrix ) @xmath16 to describe the quantum state of a quantum system . for a pure state @xmath1 , the corresponding density operator is @xmath17 .",
    "for a two - level quantum system , the state @xmath16 can be represented in terms of the bloch vector @xmath18 : @xmath19 the evolution equation of @xmath16 can be written as @xmath20\\ ] ] where @xmath21=ab - ba$ ] and @xmath22 is the total system hamiltonian .    after we represent the state @xmath16 with the bloch vector , the pure states of a two - level quantum system correspond to the surface of the bloch sphere , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "an arbitrary pure state @xmath1 for a two - level quantum system can be represented as @xmath26      sliding modes play an important role in variable structure control @xcite .",
    "usually , the sliding mode is constructed so that the system has desired dynamics in the sliding surface . for a quantum control problem , a sliding mode may be represented as a functional of the state @xmath1 and the hamiltonian @xmath22 ; i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "for example , an eigenstate @xmath28 of the free hamiltonian @xmath29 ( i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is one eigenvalue of @xmath29 ) can be selected as a sliding mode .",
    "we can define @xmath32 . if the initial state @xmath33 is in the sliding mode",
    "; i.e. , @xmath34 , we can easily prove that the quantum system will maintain its state in this surface under only the action of the free hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , @xmath35 , and we have @xmath36 that is , an eigenstate of @xmath29 can be identified as a sliding mode . for two - level quantum systems , we may select either @xmath6 or @xmath7 as a sliding mode . without loss of generality",
    ", we identify the eigenstate @xmath6 of a two - level quantum system as the sliding mode in this paper .      in section ii.b",
    ", we have identified an eigenstate @xmath6 as a sliding mode .",
    "this means that if a quantum system is driven into the sliding mode , its state will be maintained in the sliding surface under the action of the free hamiltonian .",
    "however , in practical applications , it is inevitable that there exist noises and uncertainties . in this paper",
    ", we suppose that the uncertainties can be approximately described as perturbations in the hamiltonian .",
    "that is , the uncertainties can be denoted as @xmath37 .",
    "the unitary errors in @xcite belong to this class of uncertainties and uncertainties in one - qubit ( one quantum bit ) gate also correspond to this class of uncertainties @xcite . for a spin system in solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , external noisy magnetic fields and unwanted coupling with other spins may lead to uncertainties in this class .",
    "further , we assume the uncertainties are bounded ; i.e. , @xmath38 when @xmath39 , @xmath40 . that is ,",
    "there exist no uncertainties , which is trivial for our problem .",
    "hence , in the following we assume @xmath41 .",
    "an important advantage of classical sliding mode control is its robustness .",
    "our main motivation for introducing sliding mode control to quantum systems is to deal with uncertainties .",
    "we further suppose that the corresponding system without uncertainties is completely controllable and arbitrary unitary control operations can be generated .",
    "this assumption can be guaranteed for a two - level quantum system if we can realize arbitrary rotations along the @xmath42-axis and @xmath43-axis ( @xmath44 ) ( e.g. , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the control problem under consideration is stated as follows : design a control law to drive and then maintain the quantum system s state in a sliding mode domain even when bounded uncertainties exist in the system hamiltonian . here",
    "a sliding mode domain may be defined as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a given constant .",
    "here we assume @xmath47 since the case @xmath48 only occurs in the sliding mode surface and the case @xmath49 is always true .",
    "hence , the two cases with @xmath48 and @xmath49 are trivial for our problem .",
    "the definition of the sliding mode domain implies that the system has a probability of at most @xmath46 ( which we call the probability of failure ) to collapse out of @xmath50 when making a measurement .",
    "this behavior is quite different from that which occurs in traditional sliding mode control .",
    "hence , we expect that our control laws will guarantee that the system s state remains in @xmath50 except that a measurement operation may take it away from @xmath50 with a small probability ( not greater than @xmath46 ) .",
    "the control problem considered in this paper includes three main subtasks : ( i ) for any initial state ( assumed to be known ) , design a control law to drive the system s state into a defined sliding mode domain @xmath50 ; ( ii ) design a control law to maintain the system s state in @xmath50 ; ( iii ) design a control law to drive the system s state back to @xmath50 if a measurement operation takes it away from @xmath50 .",
    "for simplicity , we suppose that there exist no uncertainties during the control processes ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the first task is to design a control law to drive the controlled system to the chosen sliding mode domain @xmath50 .",
    "lyapunov - based methods are widely used to accomplish this task in traditional sliding mode control .",
    "if the gradient of a lyapunov function is negative in the neighborhood of the sliding surface , then the controlled system s state will be attracted to and maintained in @xmath50 .",
    "the lyapunov methodology has also been used to design control laws for quantum systems @xcite-@xcite . however",
    ", these existing results do not consider the issue of robustness against uncertainties .",
    "since the measurement of a quantum system will inevitably destroy the measured state , most existing results on lyapunov - based control for quantum systems in fact use a feedback design to construct an open - loop control .",
    "that is , lyapunov - based control can be used to first design a feedback law which is then used to find the open - loop control by simulating the closed - loop system . then the control can be applied to the quantum system in an open - loop way .",
    "hence , the traditional sliding mode control methods using lyapunov control can not be directly applied to our problem .",
    "although quantum measurement often has deleterious effects in quantum control tasks , recent results have shown that it can be combined with unitary transformations to complete some quantum manipulation tasks and enhance the capability of quantum control @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example , vilela mendes and manko @xcite showed nonunitarily controllable systems can be made controllable by using  measurement plus evolution \" .",
    "quantum measurement can be used as a control tool as well as a method of information acquisition .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the effect of measurement on a quantum system as a control tool can be achieved through the interaction between the system and measurement apparatus . in this paper",
    ", we will combine the lyapunov methodology and projective measurements ( with the measurement operator @xmath51 ) to accomplish the sliding mode control task for two - level quantum systems .",
    "the projective measurement with @xmath51 on a two - level system makes the system s state collapse into @xmath6 ( corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath52 of @xmath51 ) or @xmath7 ( corresponding to eigenvalue @xmath53 of @xmath51 ) .",
    "the steps in the control algorithm are as follows ( see fig .",
    "1 ) :    1 .   select an eigenstate @xmath6 of @xmath29 as a sliding mode @xmath54 , and define the sliding mode domain as @xmath55 .",
    "2 .   for a known initial state @xmath33 ,",
    "construct a lyapunov function @xmath56 to find the control law that can drive @xmath33 into the sliding mode @xmath57 .",
    "3 .   for a specified probability of failure @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath56 , construct the control period @xmath58 so that the control law can drive the system s state into @xmath50 in a time period @xmath58 .",
    "4 .   for an initial condition which is another eigenstate @xmath7 , design a lyapunov function @xmath59 and construct the period @xmath60 by using a similar method to that in 3 ) . 5 .   according to @xmath46 and @xmath61 , design the period @xmath62 for periodic projective measurements .",
    "use the designed control law to drive the system s state into @xmath50 in @xmath58 and make a projective measurement at @xmath63 . then repeat the following operations",
    ": make periodic projective measurements with the period @xmath62 to maintain the system s state in @xmath50 ; if the measurement result corresponds to @xmath7 , we use the corresponding control law to drive the state back into @xmath50 .        from the above control algorithm",
    ", we see that the design of lyapunov functions and the selection of the period @xmath62 for the projective measurements are the two most important tasks . to design a control law for quantum systems ,",
    "several lyapunov functions have been constructed , such as state distance - based and average value - based approaches @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "we select a function based on the hilbert - schmidt distance between a state @xmath1 and the sliding mode state @xmath28 as a lyapunov function @xcite , @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath64 it is clear that @xmath65 .",
    "the first - order time derivative of @xmath66 is @xmath67\\\\ & = -\\sum_{k = x , y , z}u_{k}|\\langle \\psi|\\phi_{j}\\rangle|\\im[e^{i\\angle \\langle \\psi|\\phi_{j}\\rangle } \\langle \\phi_{j}|i_{k}|\\psi\\rangle],\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath68=b$ ] ( @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 denotes the argument of a complex number @xmath71 . to ensure @xmath72",

    "define @xmath77 when @xmath78 .",
    "when one employs a lyapunov methodology to design a control law , lasalle s invariance principle is a useful tool to analyze its convergence .",
    "that is , if @xmath79 is an autonomous dynamical system with phase space @xmath80 and @xmath81 is a lyapunov function on @xmath80 satisfying @xmath82 for all @xmath83 and @xmath84 , any bounded solution converges to the invariant set @xmath85 as @xmath86 ( for details , see @xcite ) . for two - level quantum systems ,",
    "lasalle s invariance principle can guarantee that the quantum state converges to the sliding mode @xmath6 under the control law in ( [ lyapunov_control ] ) ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the convergence is asymptotic .",
    "hence , we make a projective measurement with the measurement operator @xmath51 when we apply the lyapunov control to the system for @xmath58 ( corresponding to the initial condition @xmath33 ) or @xmath60 ( corresponding to the initial condition @xmath7 ) , which will drive the system into @xmath6 with a probability not less than @xmath87 .",
    "another important task is to design the measurement period @xmath62 .",
    "we can estimate a bound according to the bound @xmath61 on the uncertainties and the allowed probability of failure @xmath46 .",
    "then , we construct a period @xmath62 to guarantee control performance according to the estimated bound . an extreme case is @xmath88 .",
    "that is , after the quantum system s state is driven into the sliding mode , we make frequent measurements .",
    "this corresponds to the quantum zeno effect @xcite , which is the inhibition of transitions between quantum states by frequent measurement of the state ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "frequent measurements ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) can guarantee that the state is maintained in the sliding mode in spite of the presence of uncertainties . however , it is usually a difficult task to make such frequent measurements .",
    "we may conclude that the smaller @xmath62 is , the bigger the cost of accomplishing the periodic measurements becomes .",
    "hence , in contrast to the quantum zeno effect , we wish to design a measurement period @xmath62 as large as possible . in the following subsection",
    ", we will propose two approaches of designing @xmath62 for different situations .",
    "we select the sliding mode as @xmath89 .",
    "if there exist no uncertainties and we have driven the system s state to the sliding mode at time @xmath90 , it will be maintained in the sliding mode using only the free hamiltonian @xmath29 ; i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "that is , if the quantum system s state is driven into the sliding mode , it will evolve in the sliding surface .",
    "however , in practical applications , some uncertainties are unavoidable , which may drive the system s state away from the sliding mode .",
    "we wish to design a control law to ensure the desired robustness in the presence of uncertainties .",
    "assume that the state at time @xmath92 is @xmath93 .",
    "if we make measurements on this system , the probability @xmath94 that it will collapse into @xmath7 ( the probability of failure ) is @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "we have assumed that the possible uncertainties can be described by @xmath37 , where unknown @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 satisfy @xmath100 .",
    "we now give detailed discussions to design the measurement period @xmath62 for possible uncertainties .",
    "first we consider a special case @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this case corresponds to phase - flip type bounded uncertainties . for any @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 ) , if @xmath105 , we have @xmath106 this type of uncertainty does not drive the system s state away from the sliding mode .",
