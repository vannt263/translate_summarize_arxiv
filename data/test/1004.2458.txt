    "the discovery of over 400 extrasolar planets and the diversity of their orbital distributions dramatically changed our perception of planetary systems in the last 15 years .",
    "especially , the existence of exoplanets in very close - in or eccentric orbits stimulated theorists to develop various models for planetary migration during the epoch of planet formation . to explain the orbital distribution of known exoplanets ,",
    "a number of planetary migration models have been proposed , including disk - planet interaction models ( i.e. , type i and type ii migration models ; e.g. , ) , planet - planet scattering models considering gravitational interaction among multiple giant planets ( i.e. , jumping jupiter models ; e.g. , @xcite ) , or kozai migration models considering perturbation by a distant massive companion and coinstantaneous tidal evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these planetary migration models can now be tested by observations of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( hereafter the rm effect : @xcite ) for transiting planetary systems , which is an anomalous shift in observed radial velocities due to the occultation of a rotating star .",
    "measurements of the rm effect enable us to estimate the sky projection angle of the planetary orbital axis relative to the stellar spin axis ( i.e. , the spin - orbit alignment angle ; @xcite ) .",
    "the information of the spin - orbit alignment angle is very useful to differentiate the planet - planet scattering models and the kozai migration models from the disk - planet interaction models , because the former models predict a wider range of spin - orbit alignment angles for migrated planets , while the latter models predict that migrated planets would have only small spin - orbit alignment angles .",
    "thus an observation of a highly tilted orbit for a specific planet is strong evidence of a planet - planet scattering process or perturbation by an outer companion during its migration history .",
    "indeed , very recently several transiting exoplanets have been reported to show such highly tilted orbits via measurements of the rm effect .",
    "these observations lead to an interesting prediction : around these spin - orbit misaligned exoplanets , other massive bodies ( e.g. , massive planets , brown dwarfs , or a low - mass stellar companion ) should be present .",
    "in addition , since migration mechanisms for such exoplanets can not be distinguished by the spin - orbit alignment angles alone , direct imaging of such massive bodies gives us important additional information to distinguish between the two migration mechanisms of highly tilted orbit planets .",
    "motivated by these facts , we have initiated to search for such outer massive bodies around known transiting planetary systems with the subaru hiciao ( high contrast instrument for the subaru next generation adaptive optics ; @xcite ; suzuki et al .",
    "2010 , in prep . ) , as part of the seeds project ( strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru , pi : motohide tamura ) .",
    "the subaru hiciao is a powerful instrument to search for outer faint bodies around stars , proven by the detection of a massive planet or a brown dwarf around gj  758 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we targeted the transiting planetary system hat - p-7 , which was reported to have a planet ( hat - p-7b ) on an orbit highly inclined relative to the stellar equatorial plane ( @xcite ; hereafter nsh09 , @xcite ; hereafter wja09 ) .",
    "consequently , we report two candidates of faint stellar companions to hat - p-7 based on the subaru hiciao and the calar alto astralux data . although our data alone can not distinguish whether or not the candidate companion stars are physically associated with hat - p-7 at this point , the findings are useful to constrain the mechanism of planetary migration in this system .",

    "two faint sources at about 3 arcsec away were clearly detected .",
    "the fwhm of the psf was 6.1 pixel ( 0.058 arcsec ) .",
    "we determined positions of the candidate companion stars using the _ imexam _ task in iraf and conducted aperture photometry using the _ phot _ task .",

    ", we determined a separation of @xmath63 arcsec and a position angle of @xmath64 deg .",
    "these results are summarized in table  2 .",
    "we discovered two candidates of faint stellar companions around hat - p-7 .",
    "as for the eastern companion , the @xmath54-@xmath22 colors for the eastern companion suggest a main sequence spectral type of m5v - m6v , corresponding to 0.17 - 0.20@xmath65 @xcite .",
    "for this luminosity class , its apparent brightness in @xmath22 band yields as distance modulus of 10.03 mag for spectral type m6v , corresponding to a distance of @xmath56300 pc .",
    "it is in agreement with the distance estimate for hat - p-7 of @xmath23 pc @xcite .",
    "we note that the magnitude and color of the companion candidate would also be explained by a background m5iii - m6iii star at the distance of 126 kpc or more @xcite . as for the western companion ,",
    "the astralux norte observations only provide an upper limit on the @xmath54 and @xmath22 band brightness ; we can just derive a lower limit on its @xmath54-@xmath9 and @xmath22-@xmath9 colors .",
    "assuming that the western companion candidate is a main sequence star associated with hat - p-7 , its @xmath9 band magnitude suggest m9v - l0v , corresponding to a mass in the range 0.078 - 0.088@xmath65 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , however , it is unrealistic that both stars are true companions of hat - p-7 , because such a wide separation triple system is likely to be physically unstable and it is known that triple or quadruple stars discovered so far are hierarchial .",
    "high spectral resolution observations for the candidate companion stars would be useful to constrain their peculiar radial velocities and thereby to discriminate their binarity .",
    "in addition , follow - up direct imaging observations , in the near future , will allow us to show via common proper motion whether the objects are true companions of hat - p-7 , whose proper motion is @xmath66 mas per year in the tycho reference catalogue .",
    "we note , however , that there are over 3@xmath41 inconsistency between the subaru hiciao result and the calar alto astralux result ( epoch difference of less than 3 months ) for the separation angle of the eastern companion .",
    "however , at this point we do not conclude that the eastern companion is not associated with hat - p-7 , because the separation angle might be affected by the errors of the pixel scale , and also because the errors of the separation angle might be underestimated due to systematic errors caused by saturation or non - gaussian psf shape .",
    "thus further follow - up observations would be needed to distinguish whether the two stars are truly associated with hat - p-7 or not .",
    "in this section , we discuss realizable migration mechnisms of the highly tilted orbit planet hat - p-7b .",
    "first of all , as a simple case , if neither of the candidate companions we discovered is physically associated with hat - p-7 , only planet - planet scattering can explain the tilted orbit of hat - p-7b .",
    "we thus examine a kozai migration scenario for hat - p-7b first , based on an assumption that either of the candidate companion stars is a true binary of hat - p-7 .",
    "we present conditions required for the kozai migration of hat - p-7b with a binary companion in section 4.1 .",
    "we show a restricted area of a third body for the kozai migration in this system in section 4.2 . , and describe the impact of the possible third body ( hat - p-7c ) reported by wja09 in section 4.3 .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the angular momentum @xmath67 should be conserved in a planetary system with a binary star during the kozai mechanism , where @xmath68 is the gravitational constant , @xmath10 and @xmath0 are the mass of the planet and its host star , @xmath19 and @xmath69 are the semi - major axis and the orbital eccentricity of the planet , and finally @xmath70 ( domain : [ 0@xmath71 , 180@xmath17 ) is the mutual inclination between the orbital inclination of the planet and the binary star .",
    "in addition , given that the angular momentum is also conserved during tidal orbital evolution , @xmath72 should be conserved through the kozai migration .    using the conservation relation above",
    ", we constrain the initial mutual inclination to initiate the kozai migration in this system as follows .",
    "first we assume that hat - p-7b was born in the snow line with the initial eccentricity @xmath73 and the initial mutual inclination @xmath74 .",
    "the distance of the snow line from the host star is roughly estimated as @xmath75 au ( i.e. 20 mas ) .",
    "we note that although the position of the snow line is somewhat uncertain , this makes little impact on the following discussions . then using the conservation relation rewritten as @xmath76 where the indices @xmath77 and @xmath78 indicate values of the initial state and those as of now , we obtain @xmath79 as a necessary initial condition for the orbit of hat - p-7b .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the eccentricity would be excited over the critical value @xmath80 and the planet would initiate tidal evolution .",
    "we note that the timescale of the kozai migration under consideration is approximated as @xcite , @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the mass , orbital period , and eccentricity of the binary star , and @xmath85 is the orbital period of hat - p-7b at the initial position . assuming that @xmath86 ( as a typical mass of m star ) and @xmath87 , we obtain @xmath88 300 myr , which is sufficiently short relative to the age of this system ( @xmath89 gyr ) . in addition , the timescale of general relativity is estimated as @xcite , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the speed of light .",
    "thus general relativity would not disturb the kozai migration of hat - p-7b at an early stage .    based on equation ( 3 ) , if hat - p-7b was born with @xmath92 and if @xmath93 , namely if hat - p-7b and the binary star are coplanar now , the initial mutual inclination @xmath74 needs to be within @xmath94 to initiate the kozai migration . even if we assume that the initial eccentricity is large ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) and the current mutual inclination is zero , @xmath74 needs to be within @xmath96 .",
    "this is a very optimistic case ; if the eccentricity is lower and @xmath97 is not zero , the required condition becomes more stringent .",
    "these required conditions are very tight , but still possible ( a few suggestive circumstellar disk observations of nonzero @xmath74 for young binary stars were reported ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite for hd  80606b , a hypothetical additional body hat - p-7c in the hat - p-7 system could destroy the kozai migration process @xcite , if the timescale of orbital precession of hat - p-7b caused by the gravitational perturbation from hat - p-7c ( @xmath98 ) is shorter than that caused by the kozai mechanism due to the binary companion ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "we calculated a conditional equation for a restricted area of an outer third body at the initial stage as , @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the semi - major axis and mass of the additional planet , @xmath103 is the semi - major axis of the binary star , and @xmath104 is the laplace coefficient ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary of the restricted area is plotted in figure  3 by solid ( for @xmath105 au ) and dotted ( for @xmath106 au ) lines .",
    "the horizontal axis and the vertical axis represent @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "more specifically , the upper region of the solid ( dotted ) line is the restricted area where hat - p-7c can not exist initially for the kozai migration caused by the binary companion .",
    "this constraint is very stringent , and even analogies of saturn ( @xmath107 au , @xmath108 ) or uranus ( @xmath109 au ,",
    "@xmath110 ) can not exist .",
    "on the other hand , wja09 reported that there is indeed a possible third body hat - p-7c in the hat - p-7 system ( hereafter , just `` c '' ) .",
    "as a constraint on the mass and semi - major axis of the additional body , wja09 reported the following equation ; @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the orbital inclination of `` c '' relative to the line of sight .",
    "we plotted equation ( 7 ) ( assuming @xmath113 for simplicity ) in figure  3 using a dashed - dotted line for reference .",
    "obviously , the kozai migration scenario is totally excluded if `` c '' existed in the outer region ( beyond the snow line ) at the initial stage . thus in the presence of `` c '' , it is impossible to explain the tilted orbit of hat - p-7b by the kozai migration caused by the distant binary companion only .",
    "however , there is another chance of a `` sequential '' kozai migration scenario for a 2-body system with a binary star , as introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "namely , an inclined binary companion induces the kozai mechanism for an outer body first , and then the inclined outer body leads the kozai mechanism for an inner body . in this case , `` c '' could play an important role for the migration of hat - p-7b . if this is the case , `` c '' could have a tilted orbital axis relative to both the stellar spin axis and the orbital axis of hat - p-7b .",
    "we can not discuss this possibility in detail at this point , because the orbital parameters of `` c '' have not yet been determined .",
    "if orbital parameters of `` c '' are firmly determined , it would be interesting to discuss the possibility of a sequential kozai migration scenario .",
    "we also note that if the semi - major axis of `` c '' turns out to be large , further direct imaging of this inner body would be also interesting in the future ( e.g. , with tmt or e - elt ) .    from the above discussions",
    ", we found that the kozai migration scenario caused by a distant binary star could be realized only in a very limited situation .",
    "in addition , if `` c '' existed , the kozai migration of hat - p-7b caused directly by the binary star could not have occured , although we could not refute the possibility of a sequential kozai migration for hat - p-7b at this point . in addition , if neither of the candidate stars is a physical companion of hat - p-7 , only planet - planet scattering can explain the tilted orbit of hat - p-7b .",
    "thus with a few exceptions above , we conclude that planet - planet scattering is a more plausible explanation for the migration mechanism of hat - p-7b .",
    "we conducted direct imaging observations of hat - p-7 with the subaru hiciao and the calar alto astralux .",
    "the system was reported to have the highly tilted transiting planet hat - p-7b , and massive bodies were expected to exist in the outer region based on planetary migration theories .",
    "we discovered two companion candidates around hat - p-7 .",
    "we modeled and constrained the kozai migration scenario for hat - p-7b under the existence of a binary star , and found that the kozai migration scenario was realizable only in a very limited condition and was not favored if the additional body hat - p-7c existed as reported by wja09 . as a result",
    ", we conclude that planet - planet scattering is particularly plausible for the migration mechanism of hat - p-7b . to complement our conclusion for the migration mechanism of hat - p-7b , further radial velocity measurements of hat - p-7 are highly desired to constrain orbital parameters of hat - p-7c . in addition",
    ", further direct imaging and high spectral resolution observations for the candidate companion stars would be very useful to constrain common proper motions and peculiar radial velocities of the stars and thereby to discriminate their binarity .",
