    "for the vacuum state of qcd and the properties of low - temperature qcd the existence of non - trivial topological excitations is important .",
    "well known are instantons  @xcite as classical solutions in euclidean space .",
    "the role of topology for the solution of the famous @xmath0 problem has been recognized very early  @xcite .",
    "it is known by now from lattice qcd that the ( fractal ) dimensionality of the topological structures in the vacuum depends very strongly on the resolution scale  @xcite . in particular , infrared instantons structures",
    "are believed to explain chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the gluon fields contributing to the path integral at finite temperature correspondingly may contain calorons  @xcite . because of non - trivial holonomy they consist of dyons and therefore , have a richer structure than instantons .",
    "their changes they experience at the qcd phase transition are presently under study  @xcite .    some time ago the gluonic topological structure and the famous axial anomaly have been proposed to be immediately observable ( and controllable ) through the generation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 violating domains in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated by detailed numerical calculations @xcite that macroscopic domains of ( anti)parallel color - electric and color - magnetic field can emerge in a heavy ion collision creating an increasing chiral imbalance among the quarks which are deconfined due to the high temperature .",
    "in this situation , the magnetic field created by the spectator nucleons may initiate a charge separation relative to the reaction plane ( parallel to the electro - magnetic field )  @xcite . the resulting charge asymmetry of quarks",
    "would become observable in terms of recombined hadrons ( chiral - magnetic effect ) @xcite .",
    "the strength ( and particularly the dependence on the collision energy ) of this effect has been theoretically studied and proposed to be a measure for the transient existence of liberated quarks  @xcite .    in recent years",
    "the dependence of the chiral and deconfinement transitions on the magnetic field has been investigated both in models and ab - initio lattice simulations , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it remains an open question whether the phase transition from quarks to hadrons , i.e. the onset of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking ( and vice versa ) , depends on the chiral imbalance .    in this article",
    "we study the change of the phase structure by an equilibrium lattice simulation .",
    "we mimic the topological content ( of a topologically nontrivial gluonic background in heavy ion collisions ) by a standard of chiral imbalance , which is provided by a chiral chemical condensate . in this form",
    ", the modification of the phase diagram by the chiral chemical potential @xmath3 has been studied mainly in effective models @xcite with which we will compare our results .    on the lattice ,",
    "contrary to the ordinary chemical potential ( for quarks , i.e. baryonic charge ) , simulations with non - zero @xmath3 are not hampered by a sign problem .",
    "they are accessible to standard hybrid monte carlo algorithms",
    ". such lattice simulations with @xmath4 were already performed in ref .",
    "the main goal of these papers , however , was the chiral magnetic effect .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram was not systematically studied .    in our study",
    "we perform simulations with the @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "one reason is that less computational resources are required for this pilot study than for full qcd .",
    "the second one is that we have already carried out two - colour qcd computations with an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we have performed simulations with the @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "we employ the standard wilson plaquette action @xmath6 for the fermionic part of the action we use staggered fermions @xmath7 where the @xmath8 are the standard staggered phase factors : @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 denotes the lattice spacing , @xmath12 the bare fermion mass , and @xmath3 the value of the chiral chemical potential . in the chirality breaking term @xmath13 , @xmath14 represents a shift to a diagonally located site of a spatial elementary cube .",
    "the combination @xmath15 is connecting sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 symmetrized over the @xmath18 shortest paths between these sites . in the continuum limit",
    "( [ eq : staggeredaction ] ) can be rewritten in the dirac spinor - flavor basis @xcite as follows @xmath19    it should be noted here that the usual baryonic chemical potential @xcite and also the chiral chemical potential @xcite are introduced to the action as a modification of the temporal links by corresponding exponential factors in order to eliminate chemical potential dependent quadratic divergencies . for staggered fermions",
    "this modification can be performed as well for the baryonic chemical potential . however , for the chiral chemical potential such a modification leads to a highly non - local action @xcite .",
    "therefore , we decided to introduce @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : staggeredaction ] ) in an additive way similar to the mass term leaving aside the question of arising singularities for the time being .",
    "we expect that the polyakov loop will not contain @xmath3 dependent singular terms .",
    "we have performed simulations with two lattice sizes @xmath20 .",
    "the measured observables are    * the polyakov loop @xmath21 * the chiral condensate @xmath22 * the polyakov loop susceptibility @xmath23 * the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility @xmath24    the polyakov loop and the corresponding susceptibility are sensitive to the confinement / deconfinement phase transition , while the chiral condensate in principle responds to chiral symmetry breaking / restoration .",
    "the simulations have been carried out with a cuda code to run the hybrid monte carlo algorithm on gpu s .",
    "the dependence of the lattice spacing on the coupling parameter @xmath25 was taken from @xcite . for our simulations with the lattice size @xmath26 the fermion mass",
    "was kept fixed in lattice units at @xmath27 while changing @xmath25 .",
    "e.g. for @xmath28 this corresponds to a pion mass value @xmath29 . for the larger lattice size @xmath30 and for various @xmath25 values",
    "we have chosen the same bare quark mass in physical units @xmath31 , which corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to confirm our results we carried out simulations also for the larger lattice size @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : largeobs ] we present results for varying @xmath3 and fixed values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which for a vanishing chiral chemical potential correspond to temperatures below the transition , to the transition region , and to the high temperature phase , respectively .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , in the confinement phase the polyakov loop remains almost constant with increasing chiral chemical potential .",
    "it means , that if the system was in the confinement phase at @xmath35 , it remains confined at @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , we observe the polyakov loop to drop down both in the deconfinement phase and in the transition region .",
    "thus , the system goes into the confinement phase for sufficiently large @xmath3 . with other words ,",
    "we conclude that the critical temperature increases with an increasing chiral chemical potential in agreement with our results obtained on the smaller lattice .",
    "notice that in case of the larger lattice we have kept fixed the bare fermion mass in physical units at @xmath31 for all three @xmath25 values , while changing @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the behavior described above looks quite similar as that obtained for two - color qcd in an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "our results are in contradiction to those of the models studied in @xcite , where the critical temperature of the transition was observed to decrease .",
    "furthermore , in these papers at some critical value of the chiral chemical potential the transition was reported to become first order . in our simulations we do not see such a behavior .",
    "however , the results obtained have a tendency towards a sharper phase transition at nonzero chiral chemical potential .",
    "although the analytic results are only derived in models and not in full qcd also in our approach there are some differences to qcd .",
    "we use the @xmath5 gauge group instead of @xmath37 and four flavor degrees of freedom . moreover , the pion mass value used here is higher than the physical one .",
    "the situation can change , when one arrives at smaller quark masses .",
    "we want to address this question in a future work .",
    "the authors are grateful to v. i. zakharov and v. g. bornyakov for interesting and stimulating discussions .",
    "the simulations were performed at gpus of supercomputer k100 and computers of the berlin group . the work was supported by fefu grants no .",
