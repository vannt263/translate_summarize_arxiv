    "furthermore , the missing energy and momentum are required to be in a relation consistent with the presence of a nearly massless neutrino .",
    "extra showers in the event are ignored .",
    "the selection is described in detail in the remainder of this section .",

    "( [ eq:2dfit ] ) .",
    "the crystal ball function was varied in two ways , by keeping the @xmath57 parameter fixed to its mc fitted values and by changing the @xmath58 parameters by one @xmath59 in a mode specific way .",
    "the background was also varied . instead of a fifth degree polynomial",
    ", the data were fitted with a fourth and a sixth degree polynomial .",

    "iii.b ) to one standard deviation above or below its central value .",
    "variations of @xmath56 due to changes in the fitting function were as low as @xmath61 and as high as @xmath62 .",
    "the assigned systematic @xmath56 error is 2.0% .",
    "correlations may affect the fit of the @xmath63 peak , because the fit assumes the two variables are not correlated . to study this , we have computed the @xmath63 correlation coefficient in the signal mc sample , by calculating the correlation coefficient in each tag mode , and then reweighting for the observed number of events in each mode .",
    "the result is @xmath64 .",
    "the fit error due to remnant correlations is of order @xmath65 and is neglected .    finally , there are the systematic uncertainties on the efficiency to be considered .",
    "the @xmath2 branching fraction uncertainty is 0.8%  @xcite . the tracking efficiency error is a 0.3% gaussian systematic error per signal track , to be added linearly , totaling 0.9% per event  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath52 reconstruction efficiency error is 1%  @xcite , but depends on the exact selection criteria . to estimate the size of the systematics induced by changing selection criteria , the signal mc sample with and without the energy and angular criteria which were used to select photon candidates .",
    "there were 41269 reconstructed events with the criteria , and 41868 without the criteria , a difference of 1.5% .",
    "there were 101 events instead of 99 in the combined @xmath22 and @xmath3 peaks , a difference of 2% .",
    "we assumed a further 0.5% systematic error , listed in table  [ tab : sys ] .",
    "the positron reconstruction efficiency is evaluated in a manner similar to ref .",
    "positron efficiencies have been investigated by the collaboration using a variety of well - known kinematically constrained qed processes .",
    "the experimentally measured corrections are convoluted with the positron momentum distribution to obtain the efficiency uncertainty , which is 0.6% .",
    "the effects of the extra track cuts and of particle i d cuts can be estimated from the mc sample , by varying or eliminating the cuts .",
    "we find errors of 0.04% and 0.1% for the extra track cut and particle i d cuts respectively .    finally , a different form factor will change the efficiency , mostly because events with low @xmath66 ( the positron - neutrino mass ) produce lower energy positrons .",
    "the signal mc produce phase - space distributed events , and therefore a constant form factor . to evaluate this source of systematics ,",
    "the form factor was varied by @xmath67 , by reweighting the signal mc events according to the weights    @xmath68 with @xmath69 being the mean @xmath66 in the signal mc sample .",
    "the new efficiencies are 5.08% and 5.14% respectively , to be compared to the given value of 5.11% .",
    "a systematic error of 0.5% is assigned to this systematics .          to obtain the final result , gaussian and non - gaussian errors are convoluted with the non - gaussian signal @xmath70 distribution given by the likelihood ( fig .",
    "[ fig : likeplots ] ) , by means of a toy mc program .",
    "the procedure is used for several reasons .",
    "first , the main source of error , the unbinned likelihood , is non - gaussian , whereas the smaller sources of error are mostly gaussian .",
    "second , some sources of error shift the central value of the likelihood , an effect which can be treated exactly by shifting the likelihood on an event - by - event basis .",
    "finally , the exponential and correlated nature of some of the error sources can be reproduced exactly by mc simulation .",
    "a total of @xmath71 toy experiments are generated , to obtain the probability distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : finaleff ] .",
    "the cumulative effect of the systematic errors is to increase the limit , and the cumulative effect of the irreducible backgrounds is to decrease the limit . taking into account the systematic uncertainties and the irreducible backgrounds , the upper limit on the branching fraction changes from 0.203% ( statistical only ) to 0.201% .",
    "we report the first measurement of an upper limit for the branching fraction @xmath72 .",
    "we find @xmath730.20% at the 90% c.l .",
