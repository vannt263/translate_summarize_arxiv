    "the polarization bell states of a pair of quantized spatiotemporal electromagnetic modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for @xmath6 , denote single - photon states of horizontal and vertical polarization , respectively .",
    "these states form a maximally - entangled basis for the two - qubit hilbert space of single - photon states for modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as such",
    ", they are extremely important for applications such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum superdense coding @xcite , and quantum key distribution @xcite , as well as their fundamental role in the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to generating these states is to post - select the biphoton output from spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) @xcite , and the standard approach to verify their entanglement behavior is via quantum - interference measurements @xcite .",
    "recently , chen _ et al .",
    "@xcite reported an experiment that mimicked the quantum - interference behavior seen with an spdc entanglement source using two independent pseudothermal light beam obtained by passing laser light through a rotating ground - glass diffuser .",
    "their experiments were carried out in the low - flux regime using photon - coincidence counting , and they provided a quantum - mechanical explanation that ascribed their observations to two - photon interference , just as is the case for spdc light . _    it has long been known that the semiclassical theory of photodetection  in which light is treated as a classical electromagnetic wave and the fundamental photodetection noise is the shot noise arising from the discreteness of the electron charge  produces quantitatively identical predictions to those obtained from quantum photodetection theory when the illumination is in a classical state , i.e. , a coherent - state or a statistical mixture of such states .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed review of this topic .",
    "except for any excess noise it may carry , laser light is coherent - state light .",
    "moreover , its propagation through ground - glass diffusers , free space , optical fibers , and beam splitters are all linear transformations , for which classical - state inputs yield classical - state outputs .",
    "it follows that there must be an explanation for the experiments reported in @xcite that relies on semiclassical photodetection theory , i.e. , one that only needs classical electromagnetic waves .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to present that explanation .",
    "furthermore , although we will begin with a treatment that applies to low - flux operation using photon - coincidence counting , our approach readily extends to high - flux operation using photocurrent cross - correlation .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we describe the modified mach - zehnder interferometer ",
    "with photon - coincidence counting in the low - flux regime  that was employed in @xcite . in sec .",
    "3 we introduce our classical - light model for this interferometer , and use it to derive the singles and coincidence rates as functions of the interferometer s differential time delay and its polarization - analysis angles . here",
    "we will show that our results explain the observations reported in @xcite . finally , in sec .  4 , we indicate how our theory can be extended to high - flux operation with photocurrent cross - correlation , and we provide some concluding remarks about the implications of our work .",
    "the configuration for the experiment from @xcite is shown in figure  1 .",
    "a continuous - wave mode - locked ti : sapphire laser operating at @xmath7 nm wavelength with 78mhz pulse - repetition frequency and a @xmath8fs pulse duration illuminated an interference filter , to somewhat increase the pulse duration , followed by a rotating ground - glass diffuser , to render the light spatially incoherent .",
    "the diameter @xmath9 mm output beam from the diffuser was divided by the 50 - 50 beam splitter bs1 , with the resulting output beams propagating @xmath10 mm ( from the diffuser ) to collection planes , one of which could be offset , longitudinally , by @xmath11 .",
    "each collection plane contained the tip of a single - mode fiber , whose transverse coordinates , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , satisfied @xmath14 , where @xmath15 m is the correlation length of the speckles cast in these planes .",
    "the fibers routed the light they collected to polarizers p1 and p2 , set for orthogonal polarizations that we shall take to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , before entering the 50 - 50 beam splitter bs2 .",
    "the outputs from bs2 then underwent polarization analysis , by analyzers a1 and a2 set for angles @xmath18 and @xmath19 with respect to @xmath16 , prior to single - photon detection .",
    "computer processing completed the experiment by averaging the detector outputs over many pulses to obtain the singles rates @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the coincidence rate @xmath22 .",
    "is the nominal ground - glass to fiber - tip propagation distance , and @xmath11 is a variable offset in one arm . p1 and p2 are polarizers that select orthogonal polarizations that we shall take to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "a1 and a2 are polarization analyzers set for angles @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are single - photon detectors , width=360 ]    chen _ et al",
    ".  used quantum - mechanical analysis to show that @xmath22 consisted of a background term plus a quantum interference term that is proportional to @xmath25 when @xmath26 .",
    "their background term arises from what in a related prior experiment @xcite they called `` self - intensity correlations . ''",
    "these correlations can be measured by summing the coincidence rates when a beam block is placed in front of the fiber tip at @xmath12 and when a beam block is placed in front of the fiber tip at @xmath13 .",
    "subtracting the self - intensity correlations from the full coincidence rate obtained at @xmath26 then yields , according to theory , a unity - visibility quantum interference pattern .",
    "that background - subtracted quantum - interference pattern can then be used to obtain a violation of the chsh inequality , in the same manner that is done @xcite for the polarization - entangled signal and idler obtained from an spdc source .",

    "@xcite correct in asserting that their anticorrelation measurement could not be explained in this manner it would present quantum optics with a major conundrum : either laser light that has undergone linear transformation is _ not  in a coherent state or a random mixture of coherent states , or the quantum and semiclassical theories of photodetection _ can  make different quantitative predictions for the measurement statistics of classical - state light . in the present paper",
    ", we shall extend our scalar - wave model from @xcite to provide a classical - light explanation for the simulated bell - state reported in @xcite .",
    "the linear velocity of the ground - glass diffuser where it was illuminated in @xcite was @xmath280.8 m/s , so that for the @xmath29fs and @xmath30fs post - if pulse durations considered therein it is fair to say that the ground glass was completely stationary while a single laser pulse propagated through it .",

    "@xcite use quantum analysis to show that photon - coincidence counting in the figure  1 configuration  after subtraction of self - intensity correlations  mimics bell - state quantum interference .",

    "moreover , as we have just seen , that same mimicking of bell - state quantum interference will be present in photocurrent cross - correlations , taken in high - flux operation , after self - intensity correlations are subtracted . in the high - flux regime",
    ", it is clear that semiclassical theory ascribes the interference pattern to intensity - fluctuation correlations between @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ". inasmuch as the experimental results from @xcite _ can not  distinguish between the quantum and semiclassical theories , it is disingenuous to claim that the figure  1 configuration generates bell states , as opposed to simulating the quantum - interference pattern produced by detection of a bell state .",
    "after all , bell states are entangled states , and entangled states are nonclassical .",
    "hence their photodetection statistics _ can not  be fully and properly quantified by semiclassical photodetection theory . in this",
    "regard we note that post - selection , which is used to identify bell - state photon pairs produced by spdc , is very different from subtracting the self - intensity correlations in the figure  1 experiment to see bell - state quantum interference .",
    "this is because post - selection is just selecting the occurrence of a photon coincidence , i.e. , it can be performed on a pulse - by - pulse basis , whereas subtracting the self - intensity correlations in figure  1 requires collecting averages of coincidences with both beams present at bs2 and with only one beam or the other present on that beam splitter . _",
