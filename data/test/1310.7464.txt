    "da white dwarfs comprise roughly 80% of all white dwarfs ( bischoff - kim & metcalfe 2011 ) .",
    "the thermonuclear burning is basically ceased and therefore they are cooling down by shrinking and eradiating . on the cooling curve , there are dov , dbv , and dav pulsation instability strips .",
    "the dav stars are non - radial @xmath2-mode pulsators",
    ". the @xmath2-modes , with buoyancy acting as restoring force , can pulsate basically from the inner core to the outer regions of its atmosphere except for the convection zones .",
    "the pulsation mode can be characterized by three indices ( @xmath7 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 ) , where , @xmath7 is the radial order , @xmath0 the spherical degree , and @xmath8 the azimuthal number . according to the asymptotic theory for @xmath2-modes ( tassoul 1980 )",

    "castanheira & kepler ( 2008 ; 2009 ) did the asteroseismology study for 83 dav stars adopting the homogeneous core composition .",
