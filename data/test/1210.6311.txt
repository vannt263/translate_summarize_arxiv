    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has opened up a new frontier in high energy hadron - hadron collisions , allowing to test the quantum chromodynamics in unexplored regimes of energy , density and rapidities , considering different configurations of the colliding hadrons ( protons and nuclei ) ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) . in particular , the lhc experiments has unprecedented capacities to study several subjects associated to _",
    "forward physics _ as , for instance , soft and hard diffraction , exclusive production of new mass states , low-@xmath0 dynamics and other important topics ( for a review see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . furthermore",
    ", the study of the forward particle production at lhc is expected to be able to constrain the model used as input to the modelling of high - energy air showers in cosmic ray experiments .",
    "forward physics is characterized by the production of particles with relatively small transverse momentum , being traditionally associated with soft particle production , which is intrinsically nonperturbative and not amenable to first - principles analysis .",
    "very recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the inclusive production rate of neutral pions at rapidities larger than @xmath4 and very low transverse momentum @xmath3 ( @xmath5 gev ) were measured by the large hadron collider forward ( lhcf ) experiment in @xmath6 collisions at @xmath7 tev . in @xcite",
    "the transverse momentum spectra were compared with the predictions of several hadronic interaction models based on distinct assumptions . in particular , with models which assume that the particle production at very forward rapidities is dominated by nonperturbative ( soft ) physics , which is justified , _ in a first approximation _ , considering the range of transverse momentum probed by the experiment .    in this letter",
    "we propose a distinct perspective for the description of the lhcf data .",
    "basically , we take into account that at lhc energies and very forward rapidities , the wave function of one of the projectiles is probed at large bjorken @xmath0 and that of the other at very small @xmath0",
    ". the latter is characterized by a large number of gluons , which is expected to form a new state of matter - the color glass condensate ( cgc ) - where the gluon distribution saturates and non - linear coherence phenomena dominate ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such a system is endowed with a new dynamical momentum scale , the saturation scale @xmath1 , which controls the main characteristic of the particle production and whose evolution is described by an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for the correlators of wilson lines @xcite . at large energies and rapidities",
    ", @xmath1 is expected to become very larger than the qcd confinement scale @xmath2 and give the scale of the running coupling constant .",
    "our main assumption is that in the particular kinematical region probed by lhcf , the saturation scale is very larger than the qcd confinement scale @xmath2 and is the dominant momentum scale present in the process , which implies that @xmath8 and allows to calculate the neutral pion production at very low-@xmath3 using a perturbative approach .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this assumption also is implicitly present in the cgc calculations of the bulk features of the rhic and lhc data such as the energy , rapidity and centrality dependence of particle multiplicities ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the description of hadron production at large transverse momentum @xmath3 is one the main examples of a hard process in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "it can be accurately described within collinear factorization , by combining partonic cross - sections computed to some fixed order in perturbation theory with parton distribution and fragmentation functions whose evolution is computed by solving the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations @xcite to the corresponding accuracy in pqcd . the high transverse momentum @xmath3 of the produced hadron insures applicability of pqcd , which is expected to fail to low-@xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , at forward rapidities the small-@xmath0 evolution becomes important , leading to an increasing in the density of gluons and in their transverse momentum .",
    "because of that , in this kinematical range their evolution in transverse momenta can not be disregarded , which implies that at very forward rapidities the collinear factorization is expected to breakdown .",
    "an alternative is the description of the hadron production using the @xmath10-factorization scheme , which is based on the unintegrated gluon distributions whose evolution is described by the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite .",
    "however , if the transverse momentum of some of the produced particles is comparable with the saturation momentum scale , the partons from one projectile scatter off a dense gluonic system in the other projectile . in this case the parton undergo multiple scatterings , which can not be encoded in the traditional ( collinear and @xmath10 ) factorization schemes . as pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the forward hadron production in hadron - hadron collisions is a typical example of a dilute - dense process , which is an ideal system to study the small-@xmath0 components of the target wave function . in this case",
    "the cross section is expressed as a convolution of the standard parton distributions for the dilute projectile , the dipole - hadron scattering amplitude ( which includes the high - density effects ) and the parton fragmentation functions . basically , assuming this generalized dense - dilute factorization , the minimum bias invariant yield for single - inclusive hadron production in hadron - hadron processes is described in the cgc formalism by )",
    "was improved in ref .",
    "@xcite by the inclusion of inelastic contributions which are important at high transverse momentum ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , in the kinematical range of interest in this paper ( very small-@xmath3 , with @xmath12 ) this new contribution is negligible . ]",
    "@xcite    @xmath13\\,\\ , , \\label{eq : final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the transverse momentum , rapidity and the feynman-@xmath0 of the produced hadron , respectively .",
    "the @xmath16-factor mimics the effect of higher order corrections and , effectively , of other dynamical effects not included in the cgc formulation .",
    "the variable @xmath17 denotes the momentum fraction of a projectile parton , @xmath18 the projectile parton distribution functions and @xmath19 the parton fragmentation functions into neutral pions .",
    "these quantities evolve according to the dglap evolution equations @xcite and obey the momentum sum - rule .",
    "it is useful to assume @xmath20 ( see discussion below ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 and the momentum fraction of the target partons is given by @xmath22 ( for details see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the fundamental and adjoint representations of the forward dipole amplitude in momentum space and are given by @xmath25\\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function .",
    "in the large-@xmath27 limit we have the following relation between the adjoint and fundamental representations : @xmath28 the scattering amplitude @xmath29 can be obtained by solving the bk evolution equation @xcite or considering phenomenological qcd inspired models to describe the interaction of the dipole with the target .",
    "bk equation is the simplest nonlinear evolution equation for the dipole - hadron scattering amplitude , being actually a mean field version of the first equation of the b - jimwlk hierarchy @xcite . at order ( lo ) , and in the translational invariance approximation  in which the scattering amplitude does not depend on the collision impact parameter @xmath30 the bk equation reads @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the value of @xmath0 where the evolution starts ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the evolution kernel , given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ( fixed ) strong coupling constant . in its linear version",
    ", the bk equation corresponds to the bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "the solution of the lo bk equation implies that the saturation scale grows much faster with increasing energy ( @xmath38 , with @xmath39 ) than that extracted from phenomenology ( @xmath40 ) .    in the last years the next - to - leading order corrections to the bk equation",
    "were calculated @xcite through the ressumation of @xmath41 contributions to all orders , where @xmath42 is the number of flavors .",
    "the improved bk equation is given in terms of a running coupling and a subtraction term , with the latter accounting for conformal , non running coupling contributions .",
    "in the prescription proposed by balitsky in @xcite to single out the ultra - violet divergent contributions from the finite ones that originate after the resummation of quark loops , the contribution of the subtraction term is minimized at large energies . in @xcite",
    "this contribution was disregarded , and the improved bk equation was numerically solved replacing the leading order kernel in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bklo ] ) by the modified kernel which includes the running coupling corrections and is given by @xcite @xmath43.\\ ] ] the solution of the improved bk equation was studied in detail in ref .",
    "the running of the coupling reduces the speed of the evolution to values compatible with experimental data , with the geometric scaling regime being reached only at ultra - high energies . in @xcite a global analysis of the small @xmath0 data for the proton structure function using the improved bk equation was performed ( see also ref .",
    "in contrast to the bk equation at leading logarithmic @xmath44 approximation , which fails to describe the hera data , the inclusion of running coupling effects in the evolution renders the bk equation compatible with them ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in what follows we consider the bk predictions for @xmath45 ( from now on called rcbk ) obtained using the mclerran - venugopalan model for the initial condition @xcite , which is given by @xmath46,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the initial saturation scale squared and @xmath48 is an anomalous dimension .",
    "both parameters are obtained from the fit to @xmath49 data and are given by @xmath50 gev@xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 . it is important to emphasize that the solutions of the improved bk equation has been obtained considering that the running coupling is evaluated according to the usual one - loop qcd expression @xmath55 at dipoles of small size ( @xmath56 ) and frozen at larger sizes ( @xmath57 ) to the fixed value @xmath58 .",
    "the factor @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ alfa ] ) is a free parameter which is fixed by the data , being equal to 6.5 .    for comparison",
    "we also consider the phenomenological model proposed in @xcite ( denoted buw model hereafter ) , which parametrize the adjoint dipole scattering amplitude as follows @xmath60\\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is assumed to be a function of @xmath3 , rather than @xmath61 , in order to make easier the evaluation of its fourier transform , and is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xcite @xmath64 in the expression above , @xmath65 and the two free parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 are fitted in such a way to describe the rhic data on hadron production .",
    "it is clear , from eq.([buweq ] ) , that this model satisfies the property of geometric scaling @xcite , since @xmath68 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath3 only through the variable @xmath69 . besides",
    ", in comparison with other phenomenological parameterizations , in the buw model , the large @xmath3 limit , @xmath70 , is approached much faster , which implies different predictions for the large @xmath3 slope of the hadron and photon yield ( for a detailed discussion see ref .",
    "in what follows we will use eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , which is based on the cgc formalism , to calculate the neutral pion production in @xmath6 collisions at very forward rapidities .",
    "this formalism has successfully been applied to single and double inclusive particle production in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at high energy . in particular",
    ", the description of the observed suppression of the normalized hadron production transverse momentum in @xmath71 collisions as compared to @xmath6 collisions has been considered an important signature of the color glass condensate physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies of the hadron production at forward rapidities applied the cgc formalism for the kinematical region where @xmath72 gev and assumed that the hadron transverse momentum provide the hard scale for the parton distribution and fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "however , the latter assumption is not valid in the kinematical region probed by lhcf . on the other hand , one the main consequences of cgc formalism",
    "is that a system with a high gluonic density is endowed with a new dynamical momentum scale , the saturation scale @xmath1 , which controls the main characteristic of the particle production . at the lhc",
    ", @xmath1 is expected to be in range 2 - 5 gev depending upon the total energy , the rapidity of the produced particles , and the nature of the hadron ( proton or lead nucleus ) . in particular",
    ", we expect that at large rapidities , @xmath1 becomes very larger than the qcd confinement scale @xmath2 and give the scale of the running coupling constant , making it small @xmath8 .",
    "it allows to extend our ability to calculate particle production at very low @xmath3 in a small - coupling framework .",
    "our basic assumption will be that gluon saturation turns particle production into a one scale problem , with @xmath1 as the only scale apart from the size of the system .",
    "as consequence we will assume in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) that the factorization scale @xmath73 is equal to the saturation scale .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we present our predictions for the production of neutral pions in @xmath6 collisions at forward rapidities and compare our results with the lhcf data @xcite .",
    "our predictions were obtained for the central value of the distinct rapidity range . in our calculations",
    "we use the cteq5 parametrization @xcite for the parton distribution functions and the kkp parametrization for the fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "moreover , we consider the rcbk and buw models for the scattering amplitude .",
    "as emphasized above , in our calculations we will assume , in a first approximation , that @xmath74 , with @xmath75 .",
    "in the kinematical region probed at lhcf the values of @xmath76 are @xmath77 .",
    "following @xcite we take @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , as in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that @xmath80 gev@xmath51 . however , as already pointed out in @xcite , smaller values may be more preferable , especially at very forward rapidities . in order to verify this result , in our analysis",
    "we also consider two other possibilities : @xmath81 gev@xmath51 and @xmath82 gev@xmath51 . as in previous calculations",
    "@xcite there is only one free parameter in our calculation : the @xmath16-factor .",
    "it is determined in such way to provide the best description of the experimental data .",
    "we verified that an identical @xmath16-factor ( @xmath16 = 7 ) for all rapidities alllows to describe the data , independent of the model used for the scattering amplitude .",
    "moreover , the rcbk and buw models for the scattering amplitude predict almost identical momenta spectra for @xmath83 gev@xmath51 .",
    "a similar result is obtained for the other values of @xmath84 .",
    "this result is directly associated to the similar behaviour of the dipole scattering amplitude at large pair separations predicted by these two models ( see fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is the region probed in @xmath6 collisions at forward rapidities . assuming smaller values of @xmath84 we obtain similar predictions for the momenta spectra , with a mild difference at larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "finally , we analyze the dependence of our predictions on the choices for the fragmentation functions @xmath85 , parton distributions @xmath86 and factorization scale @xmath73 .",
    "we have checked that the fragmentation functions proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite are also consistent with our results .",
    "moreover , our predictions are almost identical if the cteq6 parametrization @xcite for the parton distribution functions are used in the calculations . however , as already pointed out in @xcite , the value of the @xmath87 - factor necessary in order to describe the data is strongly dependent on the choice of the factorization scale @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , the value of the @xmath87 - factor is reduced for @xmath88 if we assume that @xmath89 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare the resulting predictions with those obtained using @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have that both choices allow us to describe the lhcf data .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the value @xmath88 is similar to the values used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the cms @xmath6 data .",
    "our main conclusion is that our predictions are almost independent of the following choices : scattering amplitude , parton distribution and fragmentation functions and the initial saturation scale @xmath92 . as we can see from figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the cgc formalism is able to successfully describe the lhcf data if we assume the emergence of the saturation scale as the hard scale of the problem . only at very low @xmath3 ( @xmath93 gev )",
    "our predictions behave harder than the data , which can be an indication of soft contributions .",
    "however , at @xmath94 the experimental data are described quite well assuming the dilute - dense factorization expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) .",
    "we believe that this results is a compelling indication of the presence of non - linear qcd effects .",
    "at very high energies the traditional separation between hard and soft qcd dynamics can be oversimplified due to the presence of novel semihard scales generated dinamically , which allows to understand highly nonperturbative phenomena in qcd by using weak coupling methods . in this paper",
    "we assumed that in the particular kinematical region probed by lhcf the intrinsic momentum scale @xmath1 , associated to the gluon saturation is much larger than @xmath2 and , consequently , that @xmath8 , which implies that the neutral pion production can be calculated using a perturbative approach which includes the large gluon density present in the hadron target .",
    "basically , we assumed the emergence of saturation scale as a hard momentum scale at very forward rapidities and extended at very low @xmath3 the dilute - dense factorization , derived in the cgc formalism .",
    "our results demonstrate that for lhc energies and very forward rapidities the neutral pion production at low transverse momentum measured by lhcf collaboration can be quite well described considering the cgc formalism .",
    "we believe that this result can be considered a signature of the presence of non - linear qcd effects at high energies probed at lhc .",
    "furthermore , it can be considered as a indication that the gluon saturation effects can not be disregarded for the modelling of the high - energy air showers .",
