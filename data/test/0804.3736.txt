    "several interesting extensions of the standard model ( sm ) suggest the existence of ` hidden ' sectors consisting of @xmath6 singlet fields .",
    "these sectors of particles do not interact with the ordinary matter directly and couple to it by gravity and possibly by other very weak forces .",
    "if the mass scale of a hidden sector is too high , it will be experimentally unobservable .",
    "however , there is a class of models with at least one additional u@xmath7 gauge factor where the corresponding hidden gauge boson could be light .",
    "for example , okun @xcite proposed a paraphoton model with a massive hidden photon mixing with the ordinary photon resulting in various interesting phenomena .",
    "a similar model of photon oscillations has been considered by georgi et al .",
    "holdom @xcite showed , that by enlarging the standard model by the addition of a second , massless photon one could construct grand unified models which contain particles with an electric charge very small compared to the electron charge @xcite .",
    "these considerations have stimulated new theoretical works and experimental tests reported in @xcite-@xcite ( see also references therein ) .    in the lagrangian describing the photon - hidden photon system the only allowed ` connection ' between the hidden sector and ours is given by the kinetic mixing @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the ordinary and the hidden photon field strengths , respectively .    in the interesting case when @xmath11 has a mass @xmath12 , this kinetic mixing can be diagonalized resulting in a non - diagonal mass term that mixes photons with hidden - sector photons .",
    "hence , photons may oscillate into hidden photons , similarly to vacuum neutrino oscillations , with a vacuum mixing angle which is precisely @xmath13 .",
    "note that in the new field basis the ordinary photon remains unaffected , while the hidden - sector photon ( here denoted as @xmath0 ) is completely decoupled , i.e. do not interact with the ordinary matter at all @xcite .",
    "experimental bounds on these massive hidden photons can be obtained from searches for an electromagnetic fifth force , @xcite , from stellar cooling considerations @xcite , and from experiments using the method of photon regeneration @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , new constrains on the mixing @xmath13 for the mass region @xmath14 ev@xmath15 ev have been obtained @xcite from the results of the bmv @xcite and gammev @xcite collaborations .",
    "the new results are a factor of two better than those obtained from the previous bfrt experiment @xcite .",
    "the sun energy loss argument has also been recently reconsidered @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that helioscopes searching for solar axions are sensitive to the kev part of the solar spectrum of hidden photons and the latest cast results @xcite have been translated into limits on the @xmath16 mixing parameter @xcite .",
    "strong bounds on models with additional new particles plus a @xmath0 at a low energy scale could be obtained from astrophysical considerations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , such astrophysical constraints can be relaxed or evaded in some models , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "hence , it is important to perform independent tests on the existence of such particles in new laboratory experiments such , for example as alps @xcite , lipss @xcite , osqar @xcite , and pvlas lsw @xcite .",
    "+ since @xmath0s can be produced through mixing with real photons , it is natural to consider the sun as a source of low energy @xmath0s .",
    "it is well known that the total emission rate of the sun is of the order of @xmath17 w. moreover , the emission spectrum is also well understood .",
    "it has a broad distribution over energies up to 10 kev , and corresponds roughly to the black - body radiation at the temperature @xmath18 k ( @xmath19 ev ) .",
    "the maximum in the solar power spectrum is at about @xmath20 ev ( @xmath21 nm ) , in the blue - green part of the visible region .",
    "as happens with solar neutrinos , the coherence length of the photon - hidden photon oscillations is much smaller than the distance from the sun to the earth . in this case",
    "the photon - hidden photon transition probability is just @xmath22 and the spectral flux of hidden photons from the solar surface will be @xmath23 with the maximum at @xmath24 ev .    a considerably higher contribution to the flux of hidden photons",
    "is expected from @xmath25 oscillations in the solar interior . here",
    "the usual suppression of the mixing angle due to refractive effects is balanced by a higher emitting volume and a higher temperature .",
    "since the suppression of the mixing is more drastic as the density increases ( and maximum at the solar center ) it is certainly advantageous to search for low mass hidden sector photons with energies in the ev range , where the photon flux is maximal @xcite .",
    "for @xmath12 well below the ev , one can use the following conservative estimate for the ` bulk ' component of the hidden photon spectral flux at the earth @xcite : @xmath26 which exceeds the surface contribution except for masses @xmath27 ev .",
    "a more detailed calculation will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in this note , we propose direct experimental searches for the flux of solar hidden photons .",
    "the experiment could be performed with the super - kamiokande neutrino detector , and/or in the cast experiment at cern upgraded with a new helioscope , and is based on the photon - regeneration method used at low energies .",
    "among detectors suitable for such kind of search the most promising one is super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite .",
    "this is a large , underground , water cherenkov detector located in a mine in the japanese alps @xcite .",
    "the inner sk detector is a tank , 40 m tall by 40 m in diameter .",
    "it is filled with 5@xmath28 m@xmath29 of ultra - pure water , the optical attenuation length @xmath30 70 m , and is viewed by 11146 photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) with 7650 pmts mounted on a barrel ( side walls ) and 3496 pmts on the top and bottom endcaps .    , i.e. is daily modulated.__,width=453 ]    the pmts ( hamamatsu r3600 - 2 ) have @xmath31 50 cm in diameter @xcite .",
    "the full effective pmt photocathode coverage of the inner detector surface is 40% .",
    "the photocathode , the dynode system and the anode are located inside a glass envelope serves as a pressure boundary to sustain high vacuum conditions inside the almost spherical shape pmt .",
    "the photocathode is made of bialkali ( sb - k - cs ) that matches the wave length of cherenkov light .",
    "the quantum efficiency is @xmath31 22% at the typical wave length of cherenkov light @xmath31 390 nm . for the search for @xmath16 oscillations it is important to have the ability to see a single photoelectron ( p.e . )",
    "peak , because the number of photons arriving at a pmt will be exactly one .",
    "the single p.e .",
    "peak is indeed clearly seen ( see e.g. , figure 9 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) allowing to operate pmts in the sk experiment at a low threshold equivalent to 0.25 p.e .. it is also important , that the average pmt dark noise rate at this threshold is just about 3 khz .",
    "since @xmath0s are long - lived noninteracting particles , they would penetrate the earth shielding and oscillate into real photons in the free space between the pmt envelope and the photocathode , as shown in figure [ superk_pm ] .",
    "the photon then would convert in the photocathode into a single photoelectron which would be detected by the pmt .",
    "this could not happen for hidden photons coming from the water tank since , as we will see , the presence of the medium suppresses @xmath25 oscillations .",
    "thus , the effect of @xmath32 oscillations could be searched for in the sk experiment through an increase of the counting rate of those pmts that are ` illuminated ' by the sun _ from the back _ , as shown in figure [ superk_pm ] , in comparison with those facing the sun .",
    "the increase of the counting rate in a particular pmt depends on its orientation with respect to the sun and is daily modulated .",
    "therefore , the overall counting rate of events from @xmath32 oscillations could also be daily modulated depending on the local sk position with respect to the sun and the earth rotation axis .",
    "the number @xmath33 of expected signal events from @xmath34 conversion in sk is given by an integral over time , energy band , and the surfaces of all pmts as @xmath35 here , n@xmath36 is the number of sk pmts , @xmath37 is the total @xmath0-flux , @xmath38 is the detection efficiency , @xmath39 is the photocathode surface element , @xmath40 a unit vector pointing to the sun and @xmath41 is the @xmath42 vacuum transition probability given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance between the @xmath0 entry point to the pmt and the pmt photocathode and @xmath45 is the momentum difference between the photon and hidden photon : @xmath46 assuming @xmath47 . in the absence of photon absorption , the maximum of the @xmath34 transition probability at a distance @xmath44 corresponds to the case when @xmath48 . when @xmath49 the photon and the hidden photon fields remain in phase and propagate coherently over the length @xmath44 . in this case",
    "the transition probability degrades proportionally to @xmath50 .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 ev and for the maximum distance @xmath52 cm , this will occur for @xmath53 ev .",
    "the significance @xmath54 of the @xmath0 discovery with the super - k detector scales as @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of expected background events .",
    "the excess of @xmath34 events in the super - k detector can be calculated from the result of a numerical integration of eq.([s1 ] ) over photon trajectories pointing to the pmt . in these calculations",
    "we use a simple model of pmts , shown in figure [ superk_pm ] , without taking into account the pmt internal structure and dead materials which might results in some reduction of the signal due to the photon absorption and damping of @xmath57 oscillations .",
    "we also assume that the sun is located in the plane @xmath58 and the earth rotates around the @xmath59-axis , which is the local vertical in sk , see figure [ superk_pm ] . in the pmt vacuum volume not all @xmath0 energies effectively contribute to the signal because of its sinus dependence on @xmath45 and @xmath44 , see eq.([prob2 ] ) .",
    "assuming the main background source is the pmt dark noise gives @xmath60 here n is the number of sk pmts contributing to the signal , and @xmath61 khz is the average background counting rate of the pmts @xcite . finally , taking @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 s ( @xmath65 ) results in a signal - to - background requirement of @xmath66 .",
    "for the case of non - observation , we have computed the corresponding exclusion region in the ( @xmath67 ) plane shown in figure [ plot ] .",
    "the bound relaxes towards smaller hidden photon masses mainly because the flux is suppressed . below @xmath68 mev an additional suppression adds up because hidden photons do not have enough space to oscillate inside the sk pmt , as noted above .",
    "the sensitive region of this experiment surpasses the already established cast bounds at kev energies @xcite , and for masses above @xmath69 ev also the limits recently obtained by ahlers et al .",
    "@xcite from laser experiments",
    ".    the sensitive search of @xmath0s in the sk experiment is possible due to unique combination of several factors , namely , i ) the presence of the large number of pmts with a relatively large free vacuum volume ; ii ) the high efficiency of the single photon detection ; and iii ) the relatively low pmt dark noise .",
    "the statistical limit on the sensitivity of the proposed experiment is set by the number of pmts and by the value of the dark noise ( @xmath70 ) in the sk detector .",
    "the systematic errors are not included in the above estimate , however they could be reduced by the precise monitoring of the pmts gain @xcite .",
    "these estimates may be strengthened by more accurate and detailed monte carlo simulations of the proposed experiment .",
    "let us address the matter effects in @xmath25 oscillations . neglecting photon absorption",
    ", the @xmath25 oscillation probability gets modified only by the refractive properties of the medium .",
    "we can parametrize them as a ` photon effective mass ' @xmath71 , which accounts from deviations of the photon dispersion relation , namely @xmath72 , with @xmath73 the photon wavenumber .",
    "consequently , we find that the mixing angle and the oscillation frequency of eq . both get modified according to @xcite @xmath74 therefore ( as it happens with neutrinos ) a high refractivity ( @xmath75 ) decreases the amplitude of the oscillations , a resonant conversion is possible if eventually @xmath76 , and the rigorous definition of the vacuum case is @xmath77 .    in a completely ionized medium like the solar interior plasma",
    ", the plasma frequency @xmath78 plays the role of the photon mass .",
    "here @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the fine structure constant and @xmath81 the electron density and mass . under the presence of bounded electrons the situation changes drastically , at least for photon energies around or below the atomic resonances ( those relevant for us ) . an index of refraction @xmath82 is more suitable to account for the refractive properties of these media , which gives @xmath83 .",
    "the index of refraction is rarely smaller than one , so the mixing angle will be _ always suppressed _ with respect to the vacuum case ( impeding unfortunately a resonant detection ) .",
    "the high vacuum conditions of the sk photo - multipliers ( @xmath84 torr . ) make this suppression harmless , at least for @xmath85 ev ( using @xmath86 ev and water vapor as the main residual gas , with @xmath87 at normal conditions ) . on the other hand , in the sk water tank , with @xmath88 for visible light under normal conditions ,",
    "the @xmath25 oscillations get a suppression of the order @xmath89 . in an optimistic case @xmath90 ev and @xmath91 ev",
    "this factor is @xmath92 ! even in the case when the sk tank is filled with air @xmath93 ev and the sensitivity of the experiment could not be improved and extended to the smaller @xmath0 mass region by searching @xmath16 oscillations in the inner sk detector volume .    )",

    "the cast ( cern axion solar telescope ) experiment aims to detect solar axions through their conversion into detectable photons in the magnetic field of a 10 m long decommissioned lhc dipole magnet which is tracking the sun .",
    "a detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in @xcite .    to search for ev hidden photons",
    "one can upgrade the cast experiment with a simple helioscope detector schematically shown in figure [ cast ] .",
    "single photon detectors ( spds ) , at both ends of a vacuum pipe , are looking for the single visible photons produced through oscillations of hidden photons inside the helioscope when it is pointing the sun .",
    "-flux in the cast experiment . a vacuum pipe equipped from both sides by mirrors used to focus ordinary photons produced from @xmath95 oscillations on single photon detectors ( spds ) .",

    "this allows tracking of the sun during about 1.5 h at sunrise and the same time at sunset . the manifestation of a signal would be an excess of events in the ev energy spectrum during the sun tracking , compared to the background runs spectrum .    for a high sensitivity of the proposed experiment to achieve a low background counting rate and a high efficiency for",
    "the single photon detection is crucial .",
    "the spd used should have as large as possible sensitive area ( @xmath99 @xmath100 ) , the high red extended quantum efficiency ( @xmath101 ) , as small as possible noise counting rate ( @xmath102 hz ) , a high gain ( @xmath103 ) and a good single photoelectron peak resolution .",
    "it is known , that one of main sources of noise , which also limits the spd s single photon resolution , is the dark current originating from charge carriers thermally created in the sensitive volume of the spd .",
    "this background can be reduced by the operating the spd at a low temperature . typically , the spd dark rate decreases by several orders of magnitudes when the temperature decreases from the room one to @xmath31 100 k. thus , to achieve a low background level ( @xmath104 hz ) the spd has to be cooled down to , presumably cryogenic temperatures . among several types of spds able to operate at such conditions , pmts @xcite , silicon pmts @xcite , large area avalanche photodiods @xcite , and a new type of hybrid photodetectors ( hpd ) @xcite could be considered .",
    "in addition , optical mirrors , used to focus ordinary photons to a small spot , favour the use of a small size spd detector and some improvement of the expected signal to background ratio , specially for the largest masses @xcite .",
    "the technique of phase shift plates proposed for axion - like particle searches @xcite could be also considered for increasing the sensitivity at higher masses .    finally , performing integration over the spectra of eqs . and results in the hypothetical cast@xmath105 exclusion region shown in figure [ plot ] .",
