    "the paradigm of observables defined on an infinite hilbert space being mutually incompatible in quantum mechanics is provided by the heisenberg commutation relations for the position and momentum operators .",
    "the associated heisenberg group in connection with the corresponding weyl algebra of phase - space translations is still relevant for systems with a finite number of orthogonal states , providing a basis of the space @xmath1 . as first studied by schwinger , for each dimension @xmath5",
    "there is a set of unitary operators which give rise to a discrete equivalent of the heisenberg - weyl group @xcite .",
    "we may somehow a priori expect that the kinematics of composite quantum systems will not depend on the dimensions of their building blocks .",
    "that is , that composite systems let us say consisting in the tensor product of two different hilbert spaces ( differing only in the corresponding dimensions ) will undergo a similar evolution since they are structurally identical .",
    "mathematically , the previous fact would imply the state spaces @xmath1 to be structurally identical , at least with respect to properties closely related to the heisenberg - weyl group .",
    "however , it is surprising that the aforementioned group allows one to construct @xmath6 so - called mutually unbiased ( mu ) bases of the space @xmath1 if @xmath7 is the power of a prime number @xcite , whereas the construction fails in all other dimensions . in point of fact , no other successful method to construct @xmath6 mu bases in all dimensions is known @xcite .    given @xmath8 orthonormal bases in the space @xmath9 ,",
    "they are _ mutually unbiased _ if the moduli of the scalar products among the @xmath10 basis vectors take these values :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 .",
    "mu bases have useful applications in many quantum information processing . such ( complete ) sets of mu bases are ideally suited to reconstruct quantum states @xcite while sets of up to @xmath6 mu bases have applications in quantum cryptography @xcite and in the solution of the mean king s problem @xcite . even for @xmath4",
    ", we do not know whether there exist four mu bases or not @xcite .",
    "hence the research on the maximum number of bases for @xmath4 and construction of mu bases in @xmath13 is of great importance .",
    "the issue of mu bases constitutes another part in the field of quantum information theory that is involved in pure mathematics , such as number theory , abstract algebra and projective algebra .",
    "the methods to construct complete sets of mu bases typically deal with all prime or prime - power dimensions .",
    "they are constructive methods and effectively lead to the same bases .",
    "two ( or more ) mu bases thus correspond to two ( or more ) unitary matrices , one of which can always be mapped to the identity @xmath14 of the space @xmath9 , using an overall unitary transformation .",
    "it then follows from the conditions ( [ mub ] ) that the remaining unitary matrices must be complex hadamard matrices : the moduli of all their matrix elements equal @xmath15 .",
    "this representation of mu bases links their classification to the classification of complex hadamard matrices @xcite .    in this paper , we choose a different method to study mu bases in dimension six or any other dimension @xmath7 .",
    "we will approach the problem by directly exploring the unitary matrices  randomly distributed , but according to the haar measure  whose columns vectors constitute the bases elements , which must fulfill a series of requirements concerning their concomitant bases being unbiased .",
    "the overall scenario reduces to a simple though a bit involved optimization procedure . in point of fact",
    ", we shall perform a two - fold search employing i ) an amoeba optimization procedure , where the optimal value is obtained at the risk of falling into a local minimum and ii ) the so called simulated annealing @xcite well - known search method , a monte carlo method , inspired by the cooling processes of molten metals .",
    "the advantage of this duplicity of computations is that we can be absolutely confident about the final result reached .",
    "indeed , the second recipe contains a mechanism that allows a local search that eventually can escape from local optima .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the generation of unitary matrices according to their natural haar measure .",
    "section iii explains how the optimization is performed and the concomitant results are shown in section iv .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "the applications that have appeared so far in quantum information theory , in the form of dense coding , teleportation , quantum cryptography and specially in algorithms for quantum computing ( quantum error correction codes for instance ) , deal with finite numbers of qubits . a quantum gate which acts upon these qubits or even the evolution of that system",
    "is represented by a unitary matrix @xmath16 , with @xmath17 being the dimension of the associated hilbert space @xmath18 .",
    "the state @xmath19 describing a system of @xmath20 qubits is given by a hermitian , positive - semidefinite ( @xmath21 ) matrix , with unit trace . in view of these facts , it is natural to think that an interest has appeared in the _ quantification _ of certain properties of these systems , most of the times in the form of the characterization of a certain state @xmath19 , described by @xmath21 matrices of finite size .",
    "natural applications arise when one tries to simulate certain processes through random matrices , whose probability distribution ought to be described accordingly .",
    "this enterprise requires a quantitative measure @xmath22 on a given set of matrices .",
    "there is one natural candidate measure , the * haar measure * on the group @xmath23 of unitary matrices . in mathematical analysis ,",
    "the haar measure @xcite is known to assign an  invariant volume \" to what is known as subsets of locally compact topological groups .",
    "here we present the formal definition @xcite : given a locally compact topological group @xmath24 ( multiplication is the group operation ) , consider a @xmath25-algebra @xmath26 generated by all compact subsets of @xmath24 . if @xmath27 is an element of @xmath24 and @xmath28 is a set in @xmath26 , then the set @xmath29",
    "@xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 also belongs to @xmath26 .",
    "a measure @xmath22 on @xmath26 will be letf - invariant if @xmath33 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "such an invariant measure is the haar measure @xmath22 on @xmath24 ( it happens to be both left and right invariant ) . in other words",
    "@xcite , the haar measure defines the unique invariant integration measure for lie groups .",
    "it implies that a volume element d@xmath34 is identified by defining the integral of a function @xmath35 over @xmath24 as @xmath36 , being left and right invariant    @xmath37    the invariance of the integral follows from the concomitant invariance of the volume element d@xmath34 .",
    "it is plain , then , that once d@xmath34 is fixed at a given point , say the unit element @xmath38 , we can move performing a left or right translation .",
    "we do not gain much physical insight with these definitions of the haar measure and its invariance , unless we identify @xmath24 with the group of unitary matrices @xmath23 , the element @xmath27 with a unitary matrix @xmath39 and @xmath28 with subsets of the group of unitary matrices @xmath23 , so that given a reference state @xmath40 and a unitary matrix @xmath41 , we can associate a state @xmath42 to @xmath40 . physically what is required is a probability measure @xmath22 invariant under unitary changes of basis in the space of pure states , that is ,    @xmath43    these requirements can only be met by the haar measure , which is rotationally invariant .    now",
    "that we have justified what measure we need , we should be able to generate random matrices according to such a measure in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the theory of random matrices @xcite specifies different _ ensembles _ of matrices , classified according to their different properties .",
    "in particular , the circular unitary ensemble ( cue ) consists of all matrices with the ( normalized ) haar measure on the unitary group @xmath23 . the circular orthogonal ensemble ( coe )",
    "is described in similar terms using orthogonal matrices , and it was useful in order to describe the entanglement features of two-_rebits _ systems . given a @xmath21 unitary matrix @xmath39",
    ", the minimum number of independent entries is @xmath44 .",
    "this number should match those elements that need to describe the haar measure on @xmath23 .",
    "this is best seen from the following reasoning .",
    "suppose that a matrix @xmath39 is decomposed as a product of two ( also unitary ) matrices @xmath45 .",
    "in the vicinity of @xmath26 , we have @xcite @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a hermitian matrix with elements @xmath48 . then the probability measure nearby @xmath49 is @xmath50 , which accounts for the number of independent variables . such measure for cue is invariant @xcite and therefore proportional to the haar measure .",
    "yet , the aforementioned description is not useful for practical purposes . we need to parameterize the unitary matrices according to the haar measure . according to the parameterization for cue dating back to hurwitz @xcite using euler angles , the basic assumption is that an arbitrary unitary matrix can be decomposed into elementary two - dimensional transformations , denoted by @xmath51 :    @xmath52    using these elementary rotations we define the composite transformations    @xmath53    we finally form the matrix    @xmath54    with the angles parameterizing the rotations    @xmath55    the ensuing ( normalized ) haar measure @xcite    @xmath56 d\\psi_{rs } \\cr & & \\prod_{1 < s \\le n } d\\chi_{1s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    provides us with a random matrix belonging to cue .",
    "finally , we randomly generate the angles ( [ angles ] ) _ uniformly _ and obtain the desired random matrix @xmath39 ( [ u ] ) .",
    "let us formulate the problem of having @xmath0 orthonormal bases @xmath57 in terms of the elements of a unitary matrix .",
    "all basis elements or vectors are obtained from a unitary matrix by identifying them with the corresponding columns .",
    "unitarity guarantees that all vectors will therefore be orthonormal .",
    "now we have to cope with the bases being unbiased amidst them .",
    "since each basis is represented by a unitary matrix , we then have @xmath58",
    ". this condition can be addressed by imposing that matrix elements    @xmath59    where @xmath60 , have to be equal to @xmath15 . in other words",
    ", @xmath61 has to be proportional to a hadamard - like matrix .",
    "the aforementioned conditions has to be applied to all possible @xmath62 bipartite combinations of bases @xmath63 .",
    "let us define the following quantities as the _ residuals _",
    "@xmath64    thus , the problem of finding a set of unbiased orthonormal bases is translated into the optimization procedure of finding the minimum of @xmath65 being equal to zero . if the minimum is different from zero , given @xmath7 and @xmath0 , we definitely do not have a set of unbiased bases .",
    "in addition , our function resembles very much the quantity used in @xcite to define the notion of `` unbiasedness '' between two orthonormal bases . to whether or not the aforementioned quantity represents a metric is something not checked .",
    "now that the we have translated the problem of finding mu bases into an operational one , one has to be able to explore all possible bases .",
    "this fact means that we have to be able to survey the set space of unitary matrices . since we described in the previous section how to generate random unitary matrices properly",
    ", we will have to numerically explore all unitary matrices . the way to pursue that is to consider the angles ( [ angles ] ) given @xmath7 and @xmath0 in all cases in ( [ ucdot ] ) as the variables of the function @xmath65 to be minimized .",
    "provided the concomitant optimal value ( the sum of all residuals @xmath66 ) is equal to zero , we may then have found a set of mu bases .",
    "otherwise , that may not be possible given the constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "now that we have the tools to perform a numerical survey over the set of unitary matrices , we carry out the optimization described in the previous section .      the @xmath67 case with three bases is know to exist , so our numerical procedure must return a minimal value of zero .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "( [ figa ] ) .",
    "as can be appreciated , convergence is reached very fast after each monte carlo step ( formed by 15000 different configurations each ) .",
    "therefore , we are quite confident that we have found a set of mu bases in the @xmath68case .",
    "case with three basis vs. the number of monte carlo steps . as can be clearly appreciated ,",
    "a global zero minimum is reached .",
    "see text for details.,width=332 ]    however , we must bear in mind an important issue regarding numerical surveys .",
    "not all our simulations lead to a zero minimum , so the lack of convergence is in favor of the argument that some sets of mu bases can not be extended to further number of bases . in @xmath4",
    "there are some sets of 2 mu bases that can not be extended to 3 mu bases ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . from numerical simulations",
    "it is knows that null measure sets can not be reached . in @xcite , a subset of the karlson s family of complex hadamard matrices",
    "can not be extended to 3 mu bases . additionally , the karlson s family has dimension 2 and the maximal set of complex hadamard matrices in dimension 6 has dimension 4 , so it is a null measure set .",
    "therefore , one could never achieve a unitary matrix from random simulations such that it belongs to the karlsson s family . moreover , there are 1 dimensional families and even more , isolated complex hadamard matrices in dimension six .",
    "when considering the extension of the number of mu bases @xmath69 , @xmath70 being a hadamard matrix , provided by a certain number , we then know that that function lacks the property of continuity @xcite .",
    "the absence of continuity together with an incomplete knowledge about the number discontinuities in the number of mu bases makes the overall problem a difficult one .",
    "however , in our approach , we succeed in finding at least a few cases where @xmath71 holds .",
    "the study of the case with three bases confirms that our approach to the problem is a good one . as a matter of fact",
    ", we could study the problem for any @xmath72case , but the overall optimization procedure as it is indeed the case for any simulation of a quantum system becomes intractable at some point . with the numerical tools being a valid one , we can now tackle the problem of whether @xmath67 can sustain @xmath3 mu bases .",
    "now that we have implemented the tools for performing a search in the space of unitary matrices of a given dimension @xmath21 , we are in a position a bit closer to ascertain whether it is possible to have four mu bases in the @xmath73case .",
    "we start the numerical search and the outcome of if is shown in fig .",
    "( [ figb ] ) .",
    "the evolution is such that the total function to be minimized rapidly decreases , and attains a value that is not zero .",
    "several repetitions of the same optimization procedure lead to the same conclusion : the value which is optimized is of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , we have more evidence that four mutually unbiased bases can not occur in @xmath67 .",
    "however , in the light of the previous discussion on continuity , it still remains doubts that our numerical procedure may not arrive at the minimum of 0 because we are trying to explore a set of zero measure .",
    "this fact implies that our numerical approach to the problem may have ( still ) some loopholes as far as reaching a conclusive answer .",
    "all facts points towards that @xmath3 is incompatible with @xmath4 , but we have no theorem that ascertains whether the function which is optimized reaches may ever reach a minimum of zero .",
    "in addition , we are left with an intriguing question : what is the meaning of having a set of four almost mu bases ?",
    "( let us call them @xmath75mu bases from now on ) .",
    "definitely , if we have found one such @xmath75mu bases set , it may not be unique . in point of fact",
    ", there may exist as many as different vales for the function to be optimized are reached .",
    "however , what is the physics that entails that one family of these @xmath75mu bases reaches a minimum minimorum ?",
    "in operational terms , what role could these @xmath75mu bases play in practice",
    "? it may be the case , for instance , that a subset of the four bases is mutually unbiased .",
    "case with four basis vs. the number of monte carlo steps .",
    "this typical evolution of the function to be optimized the sum of residuals in our case does not reach a minimum of zero .",
    "it approaches zero but the corresponding value is aways of @xmath74 .",
    "see text for details.,width=332 ]",
    "we have translated the problem of the existence of @xmath76bases in @xmath67 into an optimization procedure . as expected ,",
    "the concomitant numerical optimization has provided a satisfactory answer for known cases such as @xmath77 in @xmath67 .",
    "this new approach to the problem of to whether or not there exist a set of @xmath3 mu bases for @xmath4 has provided more evidence in favor that this is not case , although no theorem guarantees this argument .",
    "in addition , we are left with the interesting question on the limitations that pose the use of sets of imperfect mu bases in quantum information tasks , an issue that is certainly of interest for in experiments one has to deal with imperfections .",
    "also , our procedure is capable to explore more dimensions and bases in a straightforward manner , although taking into account that a computational limitation is reached , and therefore opens the door to similar studies in the future @xcite .",
