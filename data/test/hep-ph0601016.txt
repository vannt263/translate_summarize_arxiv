    "the recent measurements of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite @xcite on the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) have shown that the matter abundance in the universe is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the energy density of the @xmath5-th species and @xmath6 the critical energy density of the universe and @xmath7 is the present value of the hubble parameter in units of @xmath8 .",
    "the baryon abundance is also found by these measurements to be @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the cold dark matter ( cdm ) abundance in the universe is @xmath10 . the @xmath11 confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "range of this quantity is then , roughly , @xmath12 .",
    "taking @xmath13 , which is its best - fit value from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) @xcite , and assuming that the total energy density of the universe is very close to its critical energy density ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , as implied by wmap , we conclude that about @xmath15 of the energy density of the present universe consists of cdm .",
    "the question then is , what the nature , origin , and composition of this important component of our universe is .",
    "particle physics provides us with a number of candidate particles out of which cdm can be made .",
    "these particles appear naturally in various particle physics frameworks for reasons completely independent from cdm considerations and are , certainly , not invented for the sole purpose of explaining the presence of cdm in the universe .",
    "the basic properties that such a candidate particle must satisfy are the following : ( @xmath5 ) it must be stable or very long - lived , which can be achieved by an appropriate symmetry , ( @xmath16 ) it should be electrically and color neutral , as implied by astrophysical constraints on exotic relics ( like anomalous nuclei ) , but can be interacting weakly , and ( @xmath17 ) it has to be non - relativistic , which is usually guaranteed by assuming that it is adequately massive , although even very light particles such as axions can be non - relativistic for different reasons .",
    "so , what we need as constituent of cdm is a weakly interacting massive particle .",
    "there are several possibilities , but we will concentrate here on the major particle physics candidates which are the axion , the lightest neutralino , the axino , and the gravitino ( for other candidates , see e.g. ref .",
    "note that the last three particles exist only in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : axion ] , we examine the possibility that the axions are constituents of cdm .",
    "[ sec : mssm ] is devoted to outlining the salient features of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which will be used as a basic frame for discussing susy cdm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : relic ] , we summarize the calculation of the relic abundance of the lightest neutralino , which is normally the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , and investigate the circumstances under which it can account for the cdm in the universe . in secs .",
    "[ sec : axino ] and [ sec : gravitino ] , we discuss , respectively , axinos and gravitinos as constituents of cdm . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasi ] , we present a susy grand unified theory ( gut ) model which solves the bottom - quark mass problem by naturally and modestly violating the exact unification of the third generation yukawa couplings .",
    "we study the parameter space of the model which is allowed by neutralino dark matter considerations as well as some other phenomenological constraints . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the most natural solution to the strong @xmath18 problem ( i.e. the apparent absence of @xmath18 violation in strong interactions implied by the experimental bound on the electric dipole moment of the neutron ) is the one provided by a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xcite . this is a global @xmath19 symmetry , @xmath20 , which carries qcd anomalies and is spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath21 , the so - called axion decay constant or simply pq scale .",
    "astrophysical @xcite and cosmological constraints imply that @xmath22 .",
    "the upper bound originates @xcite from the requirement that the relic energy density of axions does not overclose the universe",
    ". it should be noted , however , that this upper bound can be considerably relaxed if the axions are diluted @xcite by entropy generation after their production at the qcd phase transition ( for more recent applications of this dilution mechanism , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the axion is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson corresponding to the phase of the complex pq field , which breaks @xmath20 by its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . after the end of inflation @xcite",
    ", this phase appears homogenized over the universe ( supposing that the pq field is non - zero ) with a value @xmath23 , which is known as the initial misalignment angle .",
    "naturalness suggests that @xmath23 is of order unity .",
    "this angle remains frozen until the qcd phase transition , where the qcd instantons come into play .",
    "they break explicitly the pq symmetry to a discrete subgroup @xcite since this symmetry carries qcd anomalies .",
    "so , a sinusoidal potential for the phase of the pq field is generated and this phase starts oscillating coherently about a minimum of the potential .",
    "the resulting state resembles pressureless matter consisting of static axions with mass @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the qcd scale . for @xmath26 , the mass of the axion @xmath27 .",
    "note that axions , although very light , are good candidates for being constituents of the cdm in the universe since they are produced at rest . also ,",
    "they are very weakly interacting since their interactions are suppressed by the axion decay constant @xmath21 .",
    "the relic abundance of axions can be calculated by using the formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we take the qcd scale @xmath28 and ignore the uncertainties for simplicity .",
    "we find @xmath29 ( note that a primordial magnetic helicity , may @xcite influence this abundance ) .",
    "so , for natural values of @xmath30 and @xmath26 , axions can contribute significantly to cdm , which can even consist solely of axions .",
    "the main disadvantage of axionic dark matter is that it leads to isocurvature perturbations if the pq field emerges with non - zero ( homogeneous ) value at the end of inflation .",
    "indeed , during inflation , the angle @xmath23 acquires a superhorizon spectrum of perturbations as all the almost massless degrees of freedom . at the qcd phase transition",
    ", these perturbations turn into isocurvature perturbations in the axion energy density , which means that the partial curvature perturbation in axions is different than the one in photons .",
    "the recent results of wmap @xcite put stringent bounds @xcite on the possible isocurvature perturbation .",
    "so , a large axion contribution to cdm is disfavored in models where the inflationary scale is superheavy ( i.e. of the order of the susy gut scale ) and the pq field is non - zero at the end of inflation .",
    "we now wish to turn to the discussion of the main susy candidates for dark matter : the lightest neutralino @xmath31 , the axino @xmath32 and the gravitino @xmath33 .",
    "we will consider them mainly within the simplest susy framework , which is the mssm .",
    "it is , thus , important to first outline the basics of mssm .",
    "we consider the mssm embedded in some general susy gut model .",
    "we further assume that the gut gauge group breaking down to the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath34 occurs in one step at a scale @xmath35 , where the gauge coupling constants of strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions unify .",
    "ignoring the yukawa couplings of the first and second generation , the effective superpotential below @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the quark and lepton @xmath40 doublet left handed superfields of the third generation and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the corresponding @xmath40 singlets .",
    "also , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the electroweak higgs superfields and @xmath46 the @xmath47 antisymmetric matrix with @xmath48 .",
    "the gravity - mediated soft susy - breaking terms in the scalar potential are given by @xmath49 @xmath50 , \\label{vsoft}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over all the complex scalar fields @xmath51 and tildes denote superpartners .",
    "the soft gaugino mass terms in the lagrangian are @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the bino , winos and gluinos respectively .",
    "the lagrangian of mssm is invariant under a discrete @xmath56 matter parity symmetry under which all `` matter '' ( i.e. quark and lepton ) superfields change sign . combining this symmetry with the @xmath56 fermion number symmetry under which all fermions change sign",
    ", we obtain the discrete @xmath56 r - parity symmetry under which all sm particles are even , while all sparticles are odd . by virtue of r - parity conservation , the lsp is stable and , thus , can contribute to the cdm in the universe .",
    "it is important to note that matter parity is vital for mssm to avoid baryon- and lepton - number - violating renormalizable couplings in the superpotential , which would lead to highly undesirable phenomena such as very fast proton decay .",
    "so , the possibility of having the lsp as cdm candidate is not put in by hand , but arises naturally from the very structure of mssm .",
    "the susy - breaking parameters @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) are all of the order of the soft susy - breaking scale @xmath60 , but are otherwise unrelated in the general case . however ,",
    "if we assume that soft susy breaking is mediated by minimal supergravity ( msugra ) , i.e. supergravity with minimal khler potential , we obtain soft terms which are universal `` asymptotically '' ( i.e. at @xmath36 ) .",
    "in particular , we obtain a common scalar mass @xmath61 , a common trilinear scalar coupling @xmath62 , and a common gaugino mass @xmath63 . the mssm supplemented by universal boundary conditions",
    "is known as constrained mssm ( cmssm ) @xcite .",
    "it is true that msugra implies two more asymptotic relations : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the ( asymptotic ) gravitino mass .",
    "these extra conditions are usually not included in the cmssm . imposing them , we get the so - called very cmssm @xcite , which is a very restrictive version of mssm and",
    "will not be considered in these lectures .",
    "the cmssm can be further restricted by imposing asymptotic yukawa unification ( yu ) @xcite , i.e. the equality of all three yukawa coupling constants of the third family at @xmath36 : @xmath68 exact yu , which makes the cmssm considerably more predictive , can be obtained in guts based on a gauge group such as @xmath69 or @xmath70 under which all the particles of one family belong to a single representation with the additional requirement that the masses of the third family fermions arise primarily from their unique yukawa coupling to a single superfield representation which predominantly contains the electroweak higgs superfields . it should be noted that exact yu in the cmssm leads to unacceptable values for the bottom - quark mass @xmath71 and , thus , must be corrected in order to become consistent with observations .",
    "we will ignore this problem for the moment , but we will return to it in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasi ] .",
    "now , we assume that our effective theory below @xmath36 is the cmssm with yu .",
    "this theory depends on the following parameters ( @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 with @xmath75 being the gut gauge coupling constant and @xmath76 is the ratio of the two electroweak vevs .",
    "the parameters @xmath77 and @xmath36 are evaluated consistently with the experimental values of the electromagnetic and strong fine - structure constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the sine - squared of the weinberg angle @xmath80 at @xmath81 . to this end",
    ", we integrate @xcite numerically the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for the mssm at two loops in the gauge and yukawa coupling constants from @xmath36 down to a common but variable @xcite susy threshold @xmath82 ( @xmath83 are the stop - quark mass eigenstates ) . from @xmath84 to @xmath81 ,",
    "the rges of the non - susy sm are used .",
    "the set of rges needed for our computation can be found in many references ( see e.g. ref .",
    "we take @xmath85 which , as it turns out , leads to gauge coupling unification at @xmath36 with an accuracy better than 0.1@xmath86 .",
    "so , we can assume exact unification once the appropriate susy particle thresholds are taken into account .",
    "the unified third generation yukawa coupling constant @xmath87 at @xmath36 and the value of @xmath88 at @xmath84 are estimated using the experimental inputs for the top - quark mass @xmath89 and the @xmath90-lepton mass @xmath91 .",
    "our integration procedure of the rges relies @xcite on iterative runs of these equations from @xmath36 to low energies and back for every set of values of the input parameters until agreement with the experimental data is achieved .",
    "the susy corrections to @xmath92 are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and incorporated at @xmath84 .",
    "assuming radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , we can express the values of the parameters @xmath93 ( up to its sign ) and @xmath94 ( or , equivalently , the mass @xmath95 of the @xmath18-odd neutral higgs boson @xmath96 ) at @xmath84 in terms of the other input parameters by minimizing the tree - level renormalization group ( rg ) improved potential @xcite at @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting conditions are @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 are the soft susy - breaking scalar higgs masses .",
    "we can improve the accuracy of these conditions by including the full one - loop radiative corrections to the potential from ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath84 .",
    "we find that the corrections to @xmath93 and @xmath95 from the full one - loop effective potential are minimized @xcite by our choice of @xmath84 .",
    "so , a much better accuracy is achieved by using this variable susy threshold rather than a fixed one .",
    "furthermore , we include in our calculation the two - loop radiative corrections to the masses @xmath100 and @xmath101 of the @xmath18-even neutral higgs bosons @xmath7 and @xmath102 .",
    "these corrections are particularly important for the mass of the lightest @xmath18-even neutral higgs boson @xmath7 . finally , the susy corrections to @xmath71 are also included at @xmath84 using the relevant formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite . as",
    "already mentioned , the predicted value of the bottom - quark mass is not compatible with experiment .",
    "however , we will ignore this problem for the moment .",
    "the sign of @xmath93 is taken to be positive , since the @xmath103 case is excluded because it leads @xcite to a neutralino relic abundance which is well above unity , thereby overclosing the universe , for all @xmath95 s permitted by @xmath104 .",
    "we are left with @xmath105 and @xmath62 as free input parameters .",
    "the lsp is the lightest neutralino @xmath106 .",
    "the mass matrix for the four neutralinos is @xmath107 in the @xmath108 basis . here , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , @xmath112 are the mass parameters of @xmath53 , @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ gaugino ] ) . in cmssm",
    ", the lightest neutralino turns out to be an almost pure bino @xmath53 .",
    "the lsps are stable due to the presence of the unbroken r - parity , but can annihilate in pairs since this symmetry is a discrete @xmath56 symmetry .",
    "this reduces their relic abundance in the universe .",
    "if there exist sparticles with masses close to the mass of the lsp , their coannihilation @xcite with the lsp leads to a further reduction of the lsp relic abundance .",
    "it should be noted that the number density of these sparticles is not boltzmann suppressed relative to the lsp number density .",
    "they eventually decay yielding an equal number of lsps and , thus , contributing to the relic abundance of the lsps .",
    "of particular importance is the next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) , which , in cmssm , turns out to be the lightest stau mass eigenstate @xmath114 .",
    "its mass is obtained by diagonalizing the stau mass - squared matrix @xmath115 in the gauge basis ( @xmath116 ) . here ,",

    "the stau mass eigenstates are @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the @xmath122 mixing angle .",
    "the large values of @xmath0 and @xmath90 yukawa coupling constants implied by yu cause soft susy - breaking masses of the third generation squarks and sleptons to run ( at low energies ) to lower physical values than the corresponding masses of the first and second generation .",
    "furthermore , the large values of @xmath88 implied by yu lead to large off - diagonal mixings in the sbottom and stau mass - squared matrices .",
    "these effects reduce further the physical mass of the lightest stau , which is the nlsp .",
    "another effect of the large values of the @xmath0 and @xmath90 yukawa coupling constants is the reduction of the mass @xmath95 of the @xmath18-odd neutral higgs boson @xmath96 and , consequently , the other higgs boson masses to smaller values .",
    "we now turn to the calculation of the cosmological relic abundance of the lightest neutralino @xmath31 ( almost pure @xmath53 ) in the cmssm with yu according to the standard cosmological scenario ( for non - standard scenaria , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in general",
    ", all sparticles contribute to @xmath123 , since they eventually turn into lsps , and all the ( co)annihilation processes must be considered .",
    "the most important contributions , however , come from the lsp and the nlsp .",
    "so , in the case of the cmssm , we should concentrate on @xmath31 ( lsp ) and @xmath124 ( nlsp ) and consider the coannihilation of @xmath31 with @xmath114 and @xmath125 .",
    "the important role of the coannihilation of the lsp with sparticles carrying masses close to its mass in the calculation of the lsp relic abundance has been pointed out by many authors ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here , we will use the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , which was also used in ref .",
    "note that our analysis can be readily applied to any mssm scheme where the lsp and nlsp are the bino and stau respectively .",
    "in particular , it applies to the cmssm without yu , where we have @xmath88 as an extra free input parameter .",
    "the relevant quantity , in our case , is the total number density @xmath126 since the @xmath114 s and @xmath125 s decay into @xmath31 s after freeze - out . at cosmic temperatures relevant for freeze - out ,",
    "the scattering rates of these ( non - relativistic ) sparticles off particles in the thermal bath are much faster than their annihilation rates since the ( relativistic ) particles in the bath are considerably more abundant .",
    "consequently , the number densities @xmath127 ( @xmath128 , @xmath114 , @xmath125 ) are proportional to their equilibrium values @xmath129 to a good approximation , i.e. @xmath130 . the boltzmann equation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) is then written as @xmath131 where @xmath102 is the hubble parameter , @xmath132 is the `` relative velocity '' of the annihilating particles , @xmath133 denotes thermal averaging and @xmath134 is the effective cross section defined by @xmath135 with @xmath136 being the total cross section for particle @xmath5 to annihilate with particle @xmath137 averaged over initial spin states . in our case , @xmath134 takes the following form @xmath138 for @xmath139 , we use the non - relativistic approximation @xmath140 @xmath141 here @xmath142 , 1 , 1 ( @xmath128 , @xmath114 , @xmath125 ) is the number of degrees of freedom of the @xmath5-th particle with mass @xmath143 and @xmath144 with @xmath145 being the photon temperature .    using boltzmann equation ( which is depicted in eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) ) , we can calculate the relic abundance of the lsp at the present cosmic time .",
    "it has been found @xcite to be given by @xmath146 with @xmath147 here @xmath148 is the planck scale , @xmath149 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom at freeze - out @xcite and @xmath150 with @xmath151 being the freeze - out photon temperature calculated by solving iteratively the equation @xcite @xmath152 the constant @xmath153 is chosen to be equal to @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the freeze - out temperatures which we obtain here are of the order of @xmath155 and , thus , our non - relativistic approximation ( see eq .",
    "( [ ri ] ) ) is _ a posteriori _ justified .",
    "away from s - channel poles and final - state thresholds , the quantities @xmath156 are well approximated by applying the non - relativistic taylor expansion up to second order in the relative velocity @xmath132 : @xmath157 actually , this corresponds @xcite to an expansion in s and p waves .",
    "the thermally averaged cross sections are then easily calculated @xmath158 here , we approximated the masses of the incoming particles by the neutralino mass , i.e. @xmath159 . the reduced mass of the incoming particles is then equal to @xmath160 .",
    "we also thermally averaged over the relative velocity rather than the separate velocities of the incoming particles , which would be more accurate .",

    "this sensitivity can be understood from fig .",
    "[ figc ] , where @xmath95 is depicted versus @xmath223 for various @xmath228 s .",
    "we see that , as @xmath228 decreases , @xmath95 increases and approaches @xmath246 .",

    "take over leading to a very pronounced reduction of the lsp relic abundance @xmath231 , thereby enhancing the upper limit on @xmath223 .",
    "so , we obtain the almost horizontal tail of the allowed region in fig .  [ figa ] .    for @xmath1 , @xmath225 , @xmath243 and @xmath244",
    ", we find the following allowed ranges of parameters : @xmath247 the splitting between the bottom ( or tau ) and top yukawa coupling constants @xmath248 ranges between 0.25 and 0.29 .",
    "it is interesting to note that our susy gut model gives rise @xcite naturally to a modified version of shifted hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "hybrid inflation @xcite , which is certainly one of the most promising inflationary scenarios , uses two real scalars : one which provides the vacuum energy density for driving inflation and a second which is the slowly varying field during inflation .",
    "this scheme , which is naturally incorporated @xcite in susy guts ( for an updated review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in its standard realization has the following property @xcite : if the gut gauge symmetry breaking predicts topological defects such as magnetic monopoles @xcite , cosmic strings @xcite , or domain walls @xcite , these defects are copiously produced at the end of inflation . in the case of monopoles or walls , this leads to a cosmological catastrophe @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath175 symmetry predicts the existence of doubly charged monopoles @xcite .",
    "so , any ps susy gut model incorporating the standard realization of susy hybrid inflation would be unacceptable . one way to remedy",
    "this is to invoke @xcite thermal inflation @xcite to dilute the primordial monopoles well after their production .",
    "alternatively , we can construct variants of the standard susy hybrid inflationary scenario such as smooth @xcite or shifted @xcite hybrid inflation which do not suffer from the monopole overproduction problem . in the latter scenario ,",
    "we generate @xcite a shifted inflationary trajectory so that @xmath175 is already broken during inflation .",
    "this could be achieved @xcite in our susy gut model even before the introduction of the extra higgs superfields , but only by utilizing non - renormalizable terms .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath249 and @xmath250 does not change this situation .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath195 and @xmath197 , however , very naturally gives rise @xcite to a shifted path , but now with renormalizable interactions alone .",
    "we showed that particle physics provides us with a number of candidate particles out of which the cdm of the universe can be made .",
    "these particles are not invented solely for explaining the cdm , but they are naturally there in various particle physics models .",
    "we discussed in some detail the major candidates which are the axion , the lightest neutralino , the axino , and the gravitino .",
    "the last three particles exist only in susy theories and can be stable provided that they are the lsp .",
    "the axion is a pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of a pq symmetry .",
    "this is a global anomalous @xmath19 symmetry invoked to solve the strong @xmath18 problem .",
    "it is , actually , the most natural solution to this problem which is available at present . the axions are extremely light particles and are generated at the qcd phase transition carrying zero momentum .",
    "we argued that these particles can easily provide the cdm in the universe .",
    "however , if the pq field emerges with non - zero value at the end of inflation , they lead to isocurvature perturbations , which , for superheavy inflationary scales , are too strong to be compatible with the recent results of the wmap satellite on the cmbr anisotropies",
    ".    the most popular cdm candidate is , certainly , the lightest neutralino which is present in all susy models and can be the lsp for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we considered it within the simplest susy framework which is the mssm whose salient properties were summarized .",
    "we used exclusively the constrained version of mssm which is known as cmssm and is based on universal boundary conditions . in this case , the lightest neutralino is an almost pure bino , whereas the nlsp is the lightest stau .",
    "we sketched the calculation of the neutralino relic abundance in the universe paying particular attention not only to the neutralino pair annihilations , but to the neutralino - stau coannihilations too .",
    "it is very important for the accuracy of the calculation to treat poles and final - state thresholds properly and include the one - loop qcd corrections to the higgs boson decay widths and the fermion masses .",
    "we find that two effects help us reduce the neutralino relic abundance and satisfy the wmap constraint on cdm : the resonantly enhanced neutralino pair annihilation via an @xmath96-pole exchange in the s - channel , which appears in the large @xmath88 regime , and the strong neutralino - stau coannihilation , which is achieved when these particles are almost degenerate in mass .",
    "the axino , which is the susy partner of the axion , can also be the lsp in many cases since its mass is a strongly model - dependent parameter in the cmssm .",
    "it is produced thermally by 2-body scattering or decay processes in the thermal bath , or non - thermally by the decay of sparticles which are already frozen out of thermal equilibrium . for small axino masses ,",
    "tp is more important yielding a very narrow favored region in the parameter space . for larger axino masses ,",
    "however , ntp is more efficient and the favored region in the parameter space becomes considerably wider .",
    "one finds that , in the case of the cmssm , almost any point on the @xmath251 plane can be allowed by axino cdm considerations .",
    "the required reheat temperatures though are quite small ( @xmath252 ) .",
    "the mass of the gravitino is a practically free parameter in the cmssm .",
    "so , the gravitino can easily be the lsp and , in principle , contribute to the cdm of the universe .",
    "it is produced thermally by 2-body scattering processes in the thermal bath as well as non - thermally by the decay of the nlsp , which can be either the neutralino or the stau .",
    "in contrast to the axino case , however , the nlsp can now have quite a long lifetime .",
    "the electromagnetic showers resulting from the nlsp decay can destroy the successful predictions of bbn .",
    "so , we obtain strong constraints which allow only very limited regions of the parameter space of the cmssm .",
    "as it turns out , ntp in these regions is not efficient enough to account for cdm .",
    "we can , however , make these regions cosmologically favored by raising @xmath253 to enhance tp of gravitinos .",
    "we studied the cmssm with @xmath1 and @xmath225 applying a yquc which originates from a ps susy gut model .",
    "this condition yields an adequate deviation from yu which allows an acceptable @xmath228 .",
    "we , also , imposed the constraints from the cdm in the universe , @xmath104 , @xmath254 and @xmath100 .",
    "we found that there exists a wide and natural range of cmssm parameters which is consistent with all the above constraints .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 ranges between about 58 and 59 and the asymptotic splitting between the bottom ( or tau ) and the top yukawa coupling constants varies in the range @xmath255 for central values of @xmath228 and @xmath256",
    ". the predicted lsp mass can be as low as about @xmath257 .",
    "moreover , the model resolves the @xmath93 problem of mssm , predicts stable proton , generates the baryon asymmetry of the universe via primordial leptogenesis , and gives rise to a new version of shifted hybrid inflation which is based solely on renormalizable interactions .",

    "<S> we review the main proposals of particle physics for the composition of the cold dark matter in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> strong axion contribution to cold dark matter is not favored if the peccei - quinn field emerges with non - zero value at the end of inflation and the inflationary scale is superheavy since , under these circumstances , it leads to unacceptably large isocurvature perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the lightest neutralino is the most popular candidate constituent of cold dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> its relic abundance in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model can be reduced to acceptable values by pole annihilation of neutralinos or neutralino - stau coannihilation . </S>",
    "<S> axinos can also contribute to cold dark matter provided that the reheat temperature is adequately low . </S>",
    "<S> gravitinos can constitute the cold dark matter only in limited regions of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we present a supersymmetric grand unified model leading to violation of yukawa unification and , thus , allowing an acceptable @xmath0-quark mass within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model possesses a wide range of parameters consistent with the data on the cold dark matter abundance as well as other phenomenological constraints . </S>",
    "<S> also , it leads to a new version of shifted hybrid inflation . </S>"
