    "in order to do a spectral aging analysis in the radio bridges of fanaroff - riley - ii ( frii ) radio galaxies , we have observed a sample of 13 large , powerful frii radio galaxies with the vla using multiple configurations at 330  mhz , 1.4 , 5 and 8  ghz @xcite .",
    "the sources span the redshift range of @xmath0 and have angular extents @xmath1 . using a large combined dataset comprising our radio galaxies and others from the literature",
    "we have revisited some well known radio galaxy correlations , the results of which are presented here .",
    "using the combined radio galaxy dataset we confirm that the hotspot size @xmath2 is correlated with the total linear size @xmath3 of the source and follows the relation @xmath4 .",
    "this result is consistent with a self - similar model of a jet ( eg .",
    "* ) propagating in a medium where the ambient density @xmath5 falls off with distance from source @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "this could be due to the large jets spanning hundreds of kiloparsecs in these sources , propagating mostly through a roughly constant density intergalactic medium .",
    "the hotspot spectral index is found to correlate with redshift and follows the relation , @xmath8 , which is consistent with previous studies on radio galaxies ( eg . , * ? ? ?",
    "the mean rotation measure ( rm ) of the radio lobes of the combined sample is correlated with galactic latitude .",
    "the rotation measure dispersion , on the other hand , is not .",
    "this suggests that the rm dispersion is probably caused by the source and/or its environment .    ) .",
    "dp is the ratio of the fractional polarization in the lobe at 1.4 to 5 ghz ; @xmath9 is the ratio of the radio core to lobe flux density . filled circles , stars , crosses , squares , and diamonds denote radio galaxies from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . ,",

    "filled circles , stars , crosses , squares , and diamonds denote radio galaxies from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=260 ]    we examined the liu - pooley correlation of lobe depolarization and spectral index , with the combined dataset , and found that the correlation is significant at the 99.99% significance level ( spearman rank test ; fig.1 left ) .",
    "this is an improvement from the original radio galaxy correlation ( excluding quasars ) which was observed at the 80% significance level .",
    "@xcite had concluded that differences in the medium surrounding the two radio lobes influence both the spectrum and the depolarization . a denser medium around one radio lobe would result in greater confinement of the lobe , thereby decreasing the expansion losses and increasing the radiative losses , resulting in a steeper spectral index and greater depolarization .",
    "@xcite have indeed demonstrated that the emission - line gas is intrinsically asymmetric in powerful radio sources .",
    "however , we find that the depolarization does not seem to be correlated with the arm - length ratio or misalignment angle .",
    "we find a weak correlation between lobe depolarization and radio core prominence - which is a statistical indicator of beaming and therefore orientation ( fig.1 right ) . the weak correlation is consistent with the picture of these radio galaxies lying largely in the plane of the sky .",
    "the lobe - to - lobe differences in spectral index however , do not correlate with the arm - length ratios , misalignment angles or radio core prominence .",
    "further , the arm - length ratios seem to be correlated with the misalignment angles but anti - correlated with the axial ratios .",
    "this is suggestive of environmental asymmetries close to the radio sources .",
    "such asymmetries can cause a variation in the outflow direction which can result in larger misalignments between the two sides of the source .",
    "variation in the jet direction can also result in fatter radio lobes and lower axial ratios .",
