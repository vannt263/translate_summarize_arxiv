    "the @xmath0  bootis stars are late b to early f - type populationi stars , which show a peculiar surface abundance pattern : while the light elements ( c , n , o and s ) are roughly solar , the fe - peak elements show underabundances of up to a factor of 100 .",
    "@xcite are the first who noticed the similarity between this abundance pattern and the depletion pattern of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and suggested the accretion of interstellar or circumstellar gas to explain the @xmath0  bootis stars . in this respect",
    "they differ from the rest of the peculiar a - type stars where the abundance pattern is caused by separation processes in the stellar atmosphere itself .",
    "the abundances are ascribed to diffusion in the presence of slow rotation ( am stars ) or strong magnetic fields ( ap stars ) .",
    "@xcite scrutinized the available observational data to put constraints on any model trying to explain the @xmath0  bootis phenomenon .",
    "a comparsion between the @xmath0  bootis stars and a reference sample of normal stars showed that both groups share the same fundamental parameters , like effective temperature , gravity , mass , rotational velocity and age .",
    "but most surprisingly , the na abundance of the @xmath0  bootis stars revealed a correlation with nearby local interstellar column densities of nai .",
    "this discovery , although so far tentative , because of the inhomogeneity of the stellar na abundances , motivated a detailed analysis of the interaction between a star and a diffuse ism cloud as an explanation for the @xmath0  bootis phenomenon .",
    "@xcite reconstructed the density distribution of the ism in the solar neighbourhood from nai and hi observations .",
    "they found density fluctuations of a factor of 1000 for nai and about 250 for hi .",
    "typical number densities for diffuse clouds in the ism range from 0.1 to 100  @xmath1 .    fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] shows what is supposed to happen , if a @xmath0  bootis star travels through a diffuse ism cloud : the star creates a cavity in the ism cloud .",
    "there are two questions arising : what happens to the ism dust ?",
    "what are the typical gas accretion rates ?",
    "we assume in the following a moderate density of @xmath2  @xmath1 ; using a mean molecular weight @xmath3 , appropriate for atomic gas , this leads to a lower limit of the ism mass density , @xmath4  g  @xmath1 .",
    "the dust grains of the diffuse ism cloud will be charged in the vicinity of the star .",
    "hydrogen will be mostly neutral and the dominant charged gas species is c@xmath5 . assuming 50     dust particles and a density of @xmath6  @xmath1",
    ", we derive the distance at which coulomb forces and radiation pressure are equal @xmath7 the grain potential @xmath8 is related to strength of the stellar and interstellar ultraviolet radiation field , the potential for dust grains at 500  au around an a0v star being @xmath9  v and @xmath10  v for a f5v star @xcite depending on the grain material . from this comparison",
    "we conclude that radiation pressure clearly dominates at distances out to about 10000  au from the star . at these low densities dust and gas",
    "are also not effectively coupled via collisions .",
    "hence , we deal with dust and gas separately in the two following sections .",
    "the ism consists mainly of particles much smaller than 1  @xmath11 m .",
    "the following calculations are performed for 0.01  @xmath11 m grains .",
    "@xcite showed that the ism dust particles undergo rutherford scattering off the star and hence never approach the star closer than its avoidance radius @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ratio of radiation pressure to gravity . for a spectral type of a5v ( 2r@xmath14 , 2m@xmath14 ) which resembles @xmath13  pictoris and 0.01  @xmath11 m grains , their fig .",
    "4 gives an avoidance radius of approximately 500  au .",
    "therefore , the dust grains will not be accreted by the star .",

    "our result for @xmath13  pictoris , @xmath22  au , using an 8000  k black body radiation field , and that of @xcite , who used a @xcite model atmosphere , agree within a factor of 2 , which is more than satisfactory .",
    "figure  [ fig_beta_avoidance ] shows the ratio of radiation pressure to gravity for 4 stars : an a2v star , @xmath13  pictoris , an f2v and an f5v star .",
    "the assumed stellar parameters are taken from @xcite and are shown together with the derived quantities in table  [ tab_stellar_par ] .",
    "the results clearly show that the avoidance radius for 0.01  @xmath11 m grains around a main sequence f2 star is still about 130  au , while it is only 30  au for a f5 star .",
    "stars much cooler than that may not be able to prevent accretion of ism dust grains onto their surface .",
    "interstellar gas around o and b - type stars is known to be ionized ( hii regions ) . in a first approximation , the strmgren radius around the star can be calculated from the number of lyman  @xmath23 continuum photons , @xmath24 and the density of the ism , @xmath25 , @xmath26 while the radiation field of an o star can be reasonably approximated by a black body , a - type stars have strong line blanketing in the uv .",
    "hence , to calculate the number of lyman  @xmath23 continuum photons for a and f - type stars , we used @xcite model atmospheres and the appropriate stellar radii taken from @xcite @xmath27 the resulting strmgren radii are summarized in table  [ tab_r_s ] for various a and f - type stars .",

    "the basic assumptions are that ( 1 ) the gas is mainly molecular and hence the temperature remains small via effective cooling and ( 2 ) effects of gas pressure are small compared to the gravitational forces .",
    "the first assumption may pose a problem for an a - type star which efficiently dissociates the molecular ism gas in its vicinity , but c , c@xmath5 and o are efficient alternative coolants of the gas @xcite .",
    "the second point can be checked by calculating the critical radius up to where gas pressure effects can be neglected @xcite @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the thermal velocity of the interstellar material .",
    "assuming @xmath41  km  s@xmath28 leads to a critical radius of @xmath42  au for a solar - mass star .",
    "this is well outside the regime we consider in this study .",
    "@xcite derive the radius for which ism particles are accreted onto the star @xmath43 different prefactors can be found in the literature , but @xcite showed that @xmath44 holds for steady state .",
    "this radius leads to an accretion rate of @xmath45 an a - type star of 2  m@xmath14 passing the diffuse ism cloud at a relative velocity of 17  km  s@xmath28 has an accretion radius of 9.7  au and an accretion rate of @xmath46  m@xmath14  yr@xmath28 .",
    "since no evidence is found for emission lines in the ultraviolet spectral range and accretion must overcome diffusion , the accretion rate must lie between @xmath47 @xcite and @xmath48  m@xmath14  yr@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "hence the range of relative velocities between star and diffuse ism cloud is 1 to 20  km  s@xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mass_acc ] ) .",
    "this estimate assumes that collisions occur frequently enough to reduce the angular momentum of the particles streaming around the star . in order to verify this",
    ", one can calculate the number of collisions of a particle on a circular orbit with a radius @xmath49 around the star .",
    "we assume that collisions are effective in removing angular momentum over a path length of @xmath50 and that the cross section of the gas particle is @xmath51  @xmath52 ( corresponding to a radius of @xmath53  cm ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the density of the ism cloud . inserting a 2  m@xmath14 star and assuming a relative velocity of 17  km  s@xmath28",
    ", we obtain 3 collisions for the orbiting particle .",
    "the accretion scenario will certainly work for ism clouds with densities @xmath56  @xmath1 .",
    "typical sizes @xmath57 for ism clouds are of the order of 0.1 to 10  pc @xcite .",
    "the duration of accretion is determined by the relative velocity between cloud and star and the dimension of the cloud @xmath58 in the above scenario with a relative velocity of 17  km  s@xmath28 , the star passing a diffuse ism cloud of 1  pc accretes for @xmath59  yr .    in the light of the above described scenario , the @xmath0  bootis phenomenon is a transient phenomenon .",
    "the abundance pattern imprinted by the diffuse ism cloud will disappear very rapidly , within @xmath60  yr , after the star has passed the cloud @xcite .",
    "this is due to diffusion taking over again and to effective mixing by convection and meridional circulation .",
    "since the time , which a star actually spends crossing a diffuse ism cloud , is very short , we do not expect circumstellar / interstellar lines towards every @xmath0  bootis star .",
    "in fact @xcite and @xcite have shown that about 30 per cent of the @xmath0  bootis stars reveal narrow absorption features in caiik .",
    "on the other hand @xcite have found narrow naid absorption features in 3 out of 8 @xmath0  bootis stars .",
    "the spectral range of @xmath0  bootis stars extends from b9.5v to f3v with a peak around f1v .",
    "60 per cent of the @xmath0  bootis stars are cooler than 8000  k and the stellar masses range between @xmath61 and @xmath62  m@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the distribution of rotational velocities of @xmath0  bootis a - type stars is indistinguishable from normal a - type stars @xcite , the maximum so far being 250  km  s@xmath28 .",
    "we first consider the hot end of the phenomenon , where stellar winds stop the accretion of interstellar matter and then the cool end , where convection zones become too massive to be contaminated by the above derived accretion rates .",
    "b - type stars possess radiatively driven winds and typical values derived for the mass loss rates from radiative acceleration calculations by @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "they range from @xmath63  m@xmath14  yr@xmath28 for a b0v star to @xmath64  m@xmath14  yr@xmath28 for a b7vie star .",
    "@xcite has shown that these calculations tend to overestimate the mass loss rate by typically a factor of 4 , because they do not take into account the dependence of the radiative acceleration on the outwards velocity in the wind and the detailed shadowing by photospheric lines .",
    "so the range of mass loss rates for b - type stars will then become roughly @xmath65  m@xmath14  yr@xmath28",
    ".    for the a - type stars @xcite has found mass loss rates below @xmath66  m@xmath14  yr@xmath28 .",
    "this mass loss is due to selective winds that act only on the metals and the terminal velocity of this wind is rather high , about 6000  km  s@xmath28 . comparing the momenta of the wind and the accretion flow",
    ", we find that a typical accretion rate of @xmath67  m@xmath14  yr@xmath28 at velocities of 10  km  s@xmath28 wins over the selective wind . such selective mass loss will therefore not affect the formation of a @xmath0  bootis abundance pattern . since we do not know exact mass loss rates for late b - type stars ,",
    "we can only conclude that the hot end of the @xmath0  bootis phenomenon lies at the transition between a and b - type stars .",
    "stellar evolutionary models show that the mass of the convection zone at @xmath68  yr ( that is on the main - sequence ) is @xmath53 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70  m@xmath14 for a 1.5 , 1.7 , and 2.5  m@xmath14 star respectively @xcite .",
    "overshoot is supposed to enlarge this mass by less than a factor of 10 @xcite . given the accretion timescales and rates derived in sect .",
    "[ model ] , the photospheres of stars more massive than 1.5  m@xmath14 can be contaminated by the diffuse ism cloud .",
    "@xcite have shown that meridional circulation does not completely wipe out the chemical abundance pattern established under the influence of diffusion in fast rotating stars .",
    "the timescale for mixing by meridional circulation is a fraction of the eddington - sweet time @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the equatorial rotational velocity . for the a5 and f5 star",
    "we obtain a mixing time of @xmath73 and @xmath74  yr for an equatorial velocity of 200  km  s@xmath28 .",
    "this is much longer than we expect the accretion signature to last after the accretion process has ceased .",
    "in order to test our proposed scenario with the observed number of @xmath0  bootis type objects within a given space volume , we have made the following analysis .",
    "@xcite has estimated that the current spectral classification resolution surveys in the relevant spectral domain are complete up to 60pc . within this space volume we know of 8",
    "well established @xmath0  bootis type stars : hd30422 , hd31295 , hd74873 , hd110411 , hd125162 , hd142703 , hd183324 and hd192640 .    within a space volume of 60  pc , there are about 1100 `` normal '' type stars in the relevant spectral domain .",
    "since most of the spectral classification surveys are mainly devoted to single objects , we discard all apparent spectroscopic binary systems . taking an average binary frequency of 30 per cent ,",
    "we are left with 330 apparent single objects .    as next step ,",
    "we derive a rough estimate of the space volume for which the densities of the ism are high enough so that accretion of interstellar matter on to the stellar surface occurs . for the space volume considered here , we are confronted with the `` local bubble '' which surrounds the sun .",
    "it stretches out with a radius between 30 and 300  pc .",
    "its characteristics , distribution and kinematic are still not well understood @xcite . from the maps of the local bubble from @xcite and @xcite , we determine an average value of 3 per cent for which the densities of the ism are high enough . notice that the published maps reflect the characteristics on rather large scales only ( about 10 to 20  pc ) .",
    "the kinematically and chemically structure varies on scales which are 10 times smaller than that @xcite .",
    "so we are left with 10 stars within a space volume of 60  pc which can be accounted as @xmath0 bootis type objects .",
    "this is very well in the range of the actual observed number ( 8) .",
    "however , this does , by no means , prove our scenario , but naturally explains the low number of detected members .",
    "let us also make a remark about the ( non- ) detection of @xmath0 bootis type objects in open clusters @xcite . up to now only few members in the orion ob1 association and ngc2264 ( ages about 10@xmath75  yr ) are known although an extensive survey by the group of r.o .",
    "gray in about two dozen open clusters has been performed .",
    "we believe that the lack of members in open clusters is due to a lack of gas to accrete . @xcite",
    "have shown that the remnant gas from the stellar formation dissipates in less than 10@xmath75  yr .",
    "this even holds for aggregates containing no massive stars .",
    "some @xmath0  bootis stars are members of binary systems . in all cases , where a detailed abundance analysis has been done so far , both stars turned in fact out to be @xmath0  bootis stars @xcite : hd84948a+b , hd171948a+b , hd193281/hd193256 , hd198160/hd198161 .",
    "this is naturally explained by the above described scenario , because both stars pass through the same diffuse cloud and accrete interstellar gas .",
    "if both stars have a spectral type between late b and early f , they both appear afterwards as @xmath0  bootis stars .",
    "but , if one component has an earlier or later spectral type , it will not show the typical @xmath0  bootis abundance pattern .    to test the above described scenario ,",
    "it is crucial to analyze more @xmath0  bootis binary systems and to find systems consisting of an a - type star and a companion which is beyond the hot or cool end as described in sect .",
