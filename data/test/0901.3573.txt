    "can propagate only via allowed modes and the low - temperature linear - response conductance of the qpc shows a step - like dependence on a gate voltage @xcite .",
    "when a bias voltage @xmath1 is applied between the source and drain electrodes the integer steps in the differential conductance @xmath2 are smoothed and gradually transformed into the half - integer plateaus @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a number of channels available for propagation glazman , patel , martinmoreno , frost_berggren , kristensen , cronenwett , picciotto , kothari , chen .",
    "many features of the linear and nonlinear response of the qpc are by now well understood . however , even after 20 years that have passed since the discovery of the conductance quantization , some of important aspects of the qpc conductance are not resolved yet and are still under discussions .",
    "one of the prominent examples ( apart from the famous 0.7-anomaly  @xcite ) is a so - called 0.25-feature  in the non - equilibrium differential conductance whose origin is under lively current debate picciotto , kothari , chen .    a theory of the non - equilibrium conductance of the qpc predicting the above mentioned half - integer plateaus was developed by glazman and khaetskii glazman .",
    "the half - integer plateaus have subsequently been observed and thoughtfully studied by a number of groups patel , martinmoreno , frost_berggren , kristensen , cronenwett , picciotto , kothari , chen .",
    "the theory of glazman and khaetskii @xcite and a later more refined approach by frost _",
    "@xcite successfully describe the qpc conductance in the regime when the differential conductance @xmath5 .",
    "however , for @xmath6 instead of the expected plateau at @xmath7 practically all experiments show a plateau at @xmath8 ( sometimes called as a 0.25-feature ) patel , martinmoreno , frost_berggren , kristensen , cronenwett , picciotto , kothari , chen .",
    "it has been recently argued that the 0.25-feature  corresponds to the fully spin polarized current even at zero magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this conclusion implies far reaching consequences for semiconductor spintronics as it opens up exciting possibilities to generate spin polarized current simply by applying a source - bias voltage to the quantum wire .",
    "however , alternative explanations of the 0.25-feature  due to the self - consistent electrostatics and non - linear screening of the lowest _ spin - degenerate _ subband have been advocated by other groups picciotto , kothari . in particular ,",
    "_ @xcite demonstrated that the experimental data are well - described by the analytical models of frost _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite with phenomenologically introduced asymmetric voltage drop between the source and the drain .",
    "a detailed understanding of the qpc conductance is of the prime importance because the qpc represents the cornerstone of mesoscopic physics , and the conductance quantization is a fundamental phenomenon of electron transport in low - dimensional structures .",
    "the controversy concerning the origin of the 0.25-feature  outlines the need for microscopic modeling based on the self - consistent approaches to the electron interaction and non - linear screening free from adjustable parameters .",
    "it should be stressed that previous phenomenological approaches glazman , martinmoreno , frost_berggren , kothari , while providing an important insight for interpretation of experiments , are not , however , able to uncover a microscopic origin of the observed feature .    in this paper",
    "we present a model within the self - consistent hartree approximation that allows us to describe the nonlinear screening and evolution of the conductance plateaus out of equilibrium and thus uncover underlying microscopic origin of the observed features in the differential conductance . to solve the schrdinger equation we employ a standard non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formalism @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that for @xmath9 the differential conductance exhibits @xmath10 plateau ( as opposed to the @xmath11 plateau predicted by the noninteracting theories glazman , frost_berggren ) .",
    "we also find that in the regime of @xmath12 the nonlinear screening causes the half - integer plateaus to bend upward as @xmath1 increases .",
    "note that this bending can be clearly seen in all the reported experiments patel , martinmoreno , frost_berggren , kristensen , cronenwett , picciotto , kothari , chen , but , surprisingly enough , its presence passed without comments ( except of a brief discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "our finding therefore strongly indicates that 0.25-feature  is not spin - related and is caused by the non - linear screening and related pinning of spin - degenerate electrons in the qpc .",
    "we consider a qpc defined by split gates in a gaas heterostructure ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : conductance ] . the hamiltonian of the whole system ( the qpc plus the semi - infinite leads ) can be written in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the gaas effective mass .",

    "the hartree potential is written in a standard form @xcite @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electron density , @xmath19 is the dielectric constant of gaas , and the second term describes the mirror charges placed at the distance @xmath20 from the surface , fig .",

    "let us first concentrate at the first plateau in the differential conductance .",
    "figures [ fig : dos1 ] ( c ) , ( e ) , ( g ) show the evolution of ldos as @xmath1 is increased calculated within the noninteracting tf approach .",
    "the enhanced ldos in the constriction corresponds to the position of the bottom of the lowest propagating subband . in the tf approximation the effective confinement potential",
    "is symmetrically distributed relative to @xmath55 ( that ramps linearly along the device ) . because of this the 1d subband touches @xmath55 at the qpc center ( at the energy @xmath57 ) . as a result ,",
    "the electrons injected from the left lead in the upper half of the @xmath46 window ( @xmath58 ) pass through the qpc with the unitary probability@xmath59 however , the electrons in the lower half of the @xmath46 window experience a potential barrier and hence are reflected back ( see partial current profiles , @xmath60 $ ] , in small insets in figs .",
    "fig : dos1 ( c ) , ( e ) , ( g ) ) .",
    "thus , the electrons injected from the left lead give rise to the conductance of the half of the conductance unit , @xmath61 for electrons moving in the opposite direction , from the drain to the source electrode , there is no available channel to propagate and all of them are reflected .    a character of electron transport changes dramatically when interaction is included at the quantum - mechanical level .",
    "figures [ fig : dos1 ] ( d ) , ( f ) , ( h ) show the ldos inside the constriction calculated within the hartree approximation for the first half - integer plateau where @xmath62 . with one partially propagating mode the electron density inside",
    "the constriction is low and the screening is rather week , and hence the electron interaction strongly modifies the potential profile in comparison to the symmetric tf distribution .",
    "the coulomb charging pushes up the upper 1d subband inside the qpc constriction to the top of the @xmath46 window near the source contact .",
    "( it is interesting to note that the ldos inside the qpc out of equilibrium resembles a corresponding self - consistent ldos profile of a resonant - tunneling diode @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the 1d subbands becomes pinned to the top of the @xmath46 window and therefore only a relatively narrow energy interval can supply current - carrying states that pass through the qpc ( see current profiles in the insets to fig .",
    "fig : dos1 ( d),(f),(h ) ) .",
    "hence , the qpc conductance , @xmath62 , becomes smaller than a half of the conductance unit @xmath63 .",
    "our calculations provide therefore a microscopic foundation of the phenomenological approaches that describe the 0.25-anomaly  assuming a nonsymmetric voltage drop inside the constriction@xcite .    .",
    "( the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos1 ] but for the second half - integer plateau in the differential conductance , see arrows at figs .",
    "fig : conductance(a),(b),(e),(f ) . ) ]    let us now turn to higher half - integer plateaus . in this case",
    "there is at least one propagating state inside the constriction , which , in turn , leads to enhanced screening . indeed , despite of the voltage drop between the left and the right leads , the hartree effective potentials @xmath64 and the ldos are practically flat inside the qpc , see figs . [ fig : dos2 ] ( b ) , ( d ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the corresponding tf results which do not account for screening and thus follow the linear drop of @xmath55 , see figs .",
    "fig : dos2 ( a ) , ( c ) .",
    "because of the enhanced screening , at the center of the qpc the hartree 1d subbands are situated lower than the corresponding tf subbands ( i.e below @xmath65 ) , and hence the energy window providing the transmitted states through the qpc exceeds the half of the available energy interval @xmath46 ( see the current profiles in the inset of fig . [ fig : dos2 ] ( b ) , ( d ) ) . as a result , the qpc conductance corresponding to the highest subband is larger than a half of the conductance unit @xmath66 .",
    "( note that all lower subbands are fully occupied and thus contribute to one conductance unit each ) .",
    "thus , the enhanced screening , which becomes more pronounced as @xmath1 increases , is the reason for the upward bending of the higher half - integer plateaus .",
    "finally , we stress that we utilized a model of _ spinless _ electrons in the hartree approximation .",
    "the present approach can be easily extended to account for the spin effect within the framework of the spin - density functional theory ( sdft ) . however , some previous studies questioned the reliability of the sdft for the system at hand because of the self - interaction errors of the local spin density approximation @xcite .",
    "hence , the definite answer about the role of the spin in the non - linear conductance of the qpc might require approaches that go beyond the mean field method used in the present study ( e.g. quantum monte - carlo , etc . ) .",
    "at the same time , an excellent quantitative agreement of our calculations with the experimental results outlines the dominant role of the self - consistent electrostatics and the nonlinear screening and strongly indicates that the 0.25-feature  is not spin - related .    to conclude , using negf formalism within the hartree model of spinless electrons we reproduced quantitatively the observed features of the nonlinear qpc conductance and provide microscopic interpretation of the 0.25-anomaly  as well as the upward bending of the higher half - integer plateaus in terms of non - linear screening and pinning effect .",
    "this work has been supported by the swedish research council ( vr ) .",
    "the central quantity in the negf is the lesser green s function , @xmath67 @xcite . to calculate it one has to find first the retarded green s function , @xmath68 , @xmath69where @xmath70 is an electron energy and @xmath71 is the unitary operator .",
    "this equation can be reformulated using the so - called retarded self - energies of the leads , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74where @xmath75 is the hamilton operator for the isolated scattering region ( i.e. excluding the leads ) .",
    "( for the sake of shortness we will not write explicitly a coordinate dependence of @xmath68 ) .",
    "@xmath76 are functions with non - zero values only at the boundaries with the semi - infinitive leads .",
    "coupling the scattering region with leads is described by the functions          where @xmath79 are the fermi - dirac functions in the right ( left ) lead .",
    "this equation has to be used in non - equilibrium situations when @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in equilibrium ,",
    "when the fermi functions in both leads are identical , eq . reduces to @xmath82it is also valid under a bias voltage at energies @xmath70 for which @xmath83 ( in practice , @xmath84 for those energies ) .",
    "we use both eqs . and to perform this integration .",
    "@xmath86 , eq .",

    "only several integration points are needed because the rapid variations of @xmath90 are smeared out when the integration path is far from the real axis .",
    "this is specially useful for the bound states , which give rise to sharp peaks near the real axis . on the straight path along the real axis",
    ", one needs much more integration points and for large source - drain voltage it becomes the most time consuming part of computation .",
