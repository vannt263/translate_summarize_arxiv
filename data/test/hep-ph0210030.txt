    "at this moment the nlo calculations of unpolarized quantities are almost finished so that one now is concentrating on the computations of the next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) corrections . in the case of polarized processes",
    "this stage is not reached yet and in this contribution we will report on a recent calculation of the complete nlo contribution @xcite to massive lepton pair production ( drell - yan process ) . from the study of the regge pole model in the sixties we have learnt that the predictions are in better agreement with experiment when the reaction only involves unpolarized particles . in the case",
    "the particles become polarized , predictions and data are very often at variance with each other . the same also seems to happen for perturbative qcd and therefore it will be very interesting to study polarized reactions , as will be measured in the future at the rhic ( bnl , usa ) , because they can provide us with a deeper insight in qcd . at this moment there are only data available from polarized deep inelastic lepton hadron scattering .",
    "however like in unpolarized scattering they provide little information about the gluon and sea - quark densities which are important quantities under study . in our contribution",
    "we will mainly focus on the former density which can be much better extracted if the hadronic reaction is dominated by partonic subprocesses with a gluon in the initial state .",
    "processes which are suitable to extract the polarized gluon density are jet production , charm quark production in photon - hadron collisions or deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering and direct photon production .",
    "in the subsequent part of this paper we will concentrate under which conditions the polarized gluon density can be extracted from semi - inclusive massive lepton pair production in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the latter process is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes an inclusive hadronic final state .",
    "the reaction above is described by the polarized cross section @xmath4 & & \\sum_{a , b = q , g}\\delta f_a^p(\\mu^2 ) \\otimes \\delta f_b^p(\\mu^2)\\otimes \\frac{d^3\\delta \\sigma_{ab}(\\mu^2)}{dqdp_tdy } \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 denotes the invariant mass of the lepton pair which has the transverse momentum @xmath6 and rapidity @xmath7 .",
    "further @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the polarized partonic cross section and polarized parton density respectively which both depend on the factorization scale @xmath10 .",
    "notice when the value of @xmath5 is sufficiently small , e.g. @xmath11 , the reaction in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is dominated by a virtual photon @xmath12 in the intermediate state so that one can neglect the @xmath13 contribution .    in lowest order ( lo ) of the strong coupling",
    "constant @xmath14 the following partonic subprocesses contribute to the cross section in eq .",

    "( 7 ) , ( 8) can be identical @xmath17 or non - identical @xmath18 .",
    "notice that the one - loop corrections to the born reaction in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the subprocess in eq . ( 5 ) and the interference term appearing in the @xmath19-channel in eq . ( 7 ) were calculated in @xcite which are in agreement with our results in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have included the remaining contributions so that at this moment the complete nlo correction to the cross section in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is known .",
    "the outline of this calculation and the results predicted for the rhic experiments will be presented in the next section .",
    "the computation of the virtual contributions and the radiative corrections to the partonic cross sections reveals the presence of ultraviolet , infrared and collinear divergences in loop and phase space integrals .",
    "the usual method to regularize these singularities is given by @xmath22 dimensional regularization .",
    "the advantage of this method is that before one has to carry out renormalization and mass factorization all ward - identities are automatically preserved .",
    "however this is not longer true when the @xmath23-matrix and the levi - civita tensor appear .",
    "the latter quantities show up in electro - weak interactions and in the computation of polarized processes .",
    "the terms which violate the ward identities are called evanescent and they have to be removed before renormalization and mass factorization are carried out .",
    "one of the most chosen prescription for the @xmath23-matrix is given by the hvbm approach @xcite .",
    "this prescription violates the ward identity for the non - singlet axial vector current and the adler - bardeen theorem @xcite so that one needs evanescent counter terms .",
    "the hvbm method is rather complicated since it requires that the @xmath22-dimensional space has to split up in a 4 and an @xmath24 dimensional subspace . accordingly",
    "the gamma - matrices and the momenta have to be split up which complicates the gamma - matrix algebra and the phase space integrals .",
    "this will complicate the calculations in particular if one wants to compute nnlo corrections . to avoid this complication",
    "we have chosen the approach in @xcite and replace the @xmath23-matrix by @xmath25 \\gamma_5&=&\\frac{i}{24}\\,\\epsilon_{\\rho\\sigma\\tau\\kappa}\\,\\gamma^{\\rho}\\ , \\gamma^{\\sigma}\\,\\gamma^{\\tau}\\,\\gamma^{\\kappa } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this way one can apply the usual gamma - matrix algebra in @xmath22 dimensions .",
    "moreover the integration over the final state momenta is the same as in processes where the @xmath23-matrix and the levi - civita tensor do not appear .",
    "furthermore we contract the levi - civita tensors in four dimensions before the phase space integrals are carried out .",
    "we checked that in this procedure the matrix elements are independent of an arbitrary axial gauge vector @xmath26 which appears in the polarization sum @xmath27 & & + \\frac{l^{\\nu}\\,p^{\\mu}}{l\\cdot p}\\ , , \\quad \\mbox{with}\\quad l^2=0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this method leads to more evanescent counter terms than shown by the hvbm approach .",
    "they can be extracted from a more simple cross section than the one given in eq .",
    "notice that the ultraviolet divergences do not need evanescent counter terms because in process ( 4 ) only the virtual photon is attached to the loop graphs . therefore the coupling constant renormalization can be performed in the usual @xmath28-scheme and no additional evanescent counter term is needed . only the collinear divergences which are removed by mass factorization @xmath29 & & \\otimes \\delta \\gamma_{lj}\\left ( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon},\\mu^2\\right ) \\otimes \\delta \\sigma_{kl}(\\mu^2)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 & & \\delta_{ij}+\\frac{\\alpha_s}{2\\pi}\\left [ \\left ( \\frac{2}{\\varepsilon}+\\gamma_e-\\ln 4\\pi\\right ) \\,\\delta p_{ij}\\right ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] need evanescent counter terms for all four splitting functions @xmath31 .",
    "the evanescent counter terms for the splitting functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are extracted from the drell - yan polarized cross section @xmath34 of the processes in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) respectively .",
    "this is achieved by comparing the coefficient functions using our method above with the ones obtained from a four dimensional regularization scheme where there is no problem with the @xmath23-matrix and the levi - civita tensor .",
    "for instance one can regularize the collinear divergences by taking the external quark and gluon legs off - shell ( @xmath35 ) or the quark gets a mass @xmath36 and one puts the external legs on - shell . in this case",
    "the kernels are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) denote the renormalized operator matrix elements corresponding to the local operators appearing in the operator product expansion for the product of two electromagnetic currents . to obtain the evanescent counter terms for @xmath40 and @xmath41 we followed the same procedure for the total cross section for polarized higgs production given by the subprocesses",
    "@xmath42 the genuine @xmath28-scheme for mass factorization is now given by the following replacement in eq .",
    "( 13 ) @xmath43 where @xmath31 can e.g. be found in @xcite .",
    "in order to check that the same evanescent counter terms also apply to the cross section in eq .",
    "( 2 ) we recalculated the latter using a four dimensional regularization method .",
    "it turned out that the evanescent counter terms are the same for both the reactions in eqs .",
    "( 5)-(9 ) and the processes mentioned above .",
    "the hadronic cross section in eq . ( 2 ) has been plotted using the following input . for the c.m .",
    "energy of proton - proton collisions at the rhic we have chosen @xmath44 .",
    "further we adopted the nlo approximation for the running coupling constant and the polarized parton densities given by the parametrizations in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "for the factorization scale , which is set to be equal to the renormalization scale , we have taken @xmath45 .",
    "both parametrizations are presented in two scenarios depending on the size of the gluon density .",
    "the parametrizations in @xcite are represented by the valence scenario ( vs ) and the standard scenario ( ss ) .",
    "those in @xcite are given by scenarios 1 ( s1 ) and 2 ( s2 ) respectively .",
    "over the whole @xmath46-region the polarized gluon densities for all four scenarios approximately satisfy the following inequalities @xmath47 from this behaviour it turns out that the @xmath48-channel dominates the cross section + @xmath49 provided @xmath50 .",
    "an exception is the vs - scenario where the @xmath51 subprocess becomes of equal importance over the whole @xmath6-range .",
    "this feature was already discovered in lo in @xcite so that the nlo corrections do not change this picture .",
    "however both scenarios ( vs ) and ( ss ) lead to the same transverse momentum distributions so that one can not distinguish them .",
    "the same holds for the s2 scenario in @xcite of which the cross section is slightly larger than the ones given by vs and ss .",
    "only the s1 scenario leads to a larger cross section than the other ones .",
    "this is revealed by figure 1 where we have plotted in nlo the longitudinal asymmetry defined by @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "for the computation of the unpolarized cross section in the denominator we have chosen the grv98 set in @xcite with the same factorization scale as given above . from this figure we infer that one can not distinguish between the vs and ss scenario . at @xmath54 the difference between both scenarios and the s2 scenario can be observed when the polarized cross section is known up to 12.5@xmath55 assuming 100@xmath55 polarization for the proton beams which is very unlikely .",
    "however when we allow for a 25@xmath55 uncertainty in the polarized cross section one can distinguish between scenarios s1 and s2 even if the protons are not fully polarized ( e.g. 75@xmath55 ) . in figure 2",
    "we have studied the effect of the nlo corrections to the longitudinal asymmetry when compared with the lo approximation .",
    "the effect is rather small for the ss and s1 scenarios but amounts to 30 - 40 @xmath55 at large @xmath6 for the vs and s2 scenarios . from this one",
    "can conclude that the k - factors for the polarized and unpolarized cross sections are about the same in particular for scenarios ss and s1 .",
