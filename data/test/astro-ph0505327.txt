    "the number of astrophysical sources thought to possess surface magnetic fields above the quantum critical field strength of g has been steadily growing in recent years .",
    "the five presently known soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and six or seven anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are believed to be magnetars , neutron stars having surface fields in the range @xmath0 g ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , the parkes multibeam survey ( manchester et al . 2001 ) has discovered at least six new radio pulsars that have surface fields near or above critical , and several with fields comparable to those of some of the magnetars .",
    "the radiation processes that determine the observed x - ray and gamma - ray spectra in these sources are operating in the extreme relativistic and quantum regimes and thus require treatment that is accurate in such environments .",
    "one process that is particularly important in the source emission models is resonant compton scattering , in which electrons scatter photons at the cyclotron resonance with a cross section much larger than at continuum energies .",
    "relativistic electrons can blue - shift low energy photons into the resonance , upscattering the photons into a high - energy continuum ( daugherty & harding 1989 , dermer 1990 ) .",
    "the quantum electrodynamical ( qed ) cross section for compton scattering at the cyclotron fundamental ( herold 1979 ) and higher harmonics ( daugherty & harding 1986 , bussard , alexander & mszros 1986 ) , accurate in arbitrarily high magnetic fields , has been known for some time . however , these derivations do not treat the natural line widths that render the cross section finite at the cyclotron resonances . in order to use such rates in spectral calculations in astrophysical models , the line widths that originate from the lifetimes of the excited landau states",
    "must be included in the cross section ( wasserman & salpeter 1980 ) .",
    "the width of the @xmath1th resonance is equal to the cyclotron decay rate from that state ( pavlov et al .",
    "1991 ) , and the prescription for incorporating the widths in the qed cross section in the high - field regime has been discussed by harding & daugherty ( 1991 ) and graziani ( 1993 ) . including resonant line widths in the scattering cross section necessarily requires spin - dependent decay rates , which appear in an infinite sum over landau state @xmath1 and spin of the intermediate virtual states , even in the case of ground state - to - ground state scattering in the fundamental .",
    "different spin states have different decay rates , and thus different resonant energy denominators .",
    "since the electrons and positrons in intermediate states have non - zero momentum parallel to the magnetic field , it is important to use basis states that yield a spin dependence that is lorentz invariant , i.e. boosts along the magnetic field do not lead to a mixing between the spin states .    as is true for all quantum processes , the spin - dependent rates and cross sections depend on the choice of electron wavefunctions in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "historically , several choices of wavefunctions have been used in calculations of the scattering cross section and cyclotron decay rates .",
    "the two most widely used wavefunctions are those of johnson & lippman ( 1949 ) and sokolov & ternov ( 1968 ) .",
    "the johnson & lippman ( jl ) wavefunctions are derived in cartesian coordinates and are eigenstates of the kinetic momentum operator .",
    "the sokolov & ternov ( st ) wavefunctions , specifically their `` transverse polarization '' states , are derived in cylindrical coordinates and are eigenfunctons of the magnetic moment operator . given the different spin dependence of the st and jl eigenstates , one must use caution in making the appropriate choice when treating spin - dependent processes .",
    "herold , ruder & wunner ( 1982 ) and melrose and parle ( 1983 ) have noted that the st eigenstates have desirable properties that the jl states do not possess , such as being eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian including radiation corrections , having symmetry between positron and electron states , and diagonalization of the self - energy shift operator .",
    "as found by graziani ( 1993 ) , the st wavefunctions also diagonalize the landau - dirac operator , and are the physically correct choices for spin - dependent treatments and for incorporating widths in the scattering cross section .",
    "although the spin - averaged st and jl cyclotron decay rates are equal , the spin - dependent decay rates are not , except in the special case in which the initial momentum of the electron parallel to the field vanishes .    perhaps the most fundamental argument against use of the jl wavefunctions is that radiative corrections cause excited jl landau levels to become unstable to spin - flip transition within landau states on timescales comparable to the timescale for decay to a lower landau state .",
    "these radiative corrections to the magnetic moment break the spin degeneracy of both the st and jl excited landau states ( herold , ruder & wunner 1982 ) , causing spin - dependent energy level shifts , and implying a dependence of the rates for spin - flip transitions within a landau state on the choice of wavefunctions .",
    "the rates of such spin - flip transitions within split st landau states have been evaluated ( geprgs et al . 1994 ; see also parle 1987 ) , and are found to be of order of for , which is negligible compared to decay rates between landau states .",
    "the existence of such relatively long - lived states is a premise of the s - matrix formalism and is also essential to any astrophysical calculations involving spin - dependent transitions between landau states .",
    "in contrast , it is anticipated that since the jl eigenstates do not diagonalize the self - interaction hamiltonian including radiation corrections ( i.e. the mass operator ) , the associated mixing incurred in s - matrix evaluations will render spin - flip transition rates with fixed comparable to ordinary cyclotronic rates with changes in , a situation that is unphysical .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the lorentz tranformation characteristics of cyclotron decay rates for both st and jl formulations , and derive simplified expressions for the decay rates from an arbritrary excited landau state to the ground state .",
    "we show that the st eigenstates preserve separability of the spin dependence under lorentz boosts along the local magnetic field , a desirable property that does not extend to the jl formalism , for which such lorentz boosts mix the corresponding spin states . in the st formulation , by taking advantage of its spin - state preserving characteristics , our analytic simplifications can be elegantly applied to the spin - dependent decay rates ; in the jl formalism the simplifications can be compactly applied only to the spin - averaged rates .",
    "the resulting expressions replace integrals over emergent photon angle with series of legendre functions of the second kind , which correspond to sums of elementary functions , easily yielding simple asymptotic forms",
    ".    the expressions derived here should have wide applicability to modeling cyclotron emission , compton scattering and other qed processes in super - critical fields .",
    "for such magnetar - type fields , resonant scattering takes place primarily at the fundamental , since the cyclotron energy exceeds 1 mev .",
    "although the resonant scattering line widths formally involve infinite sums over landau states , in the case of the fundamental resonance the sum is dominated by the @xmath2 state , whose width is equal to the @xmath3 cyclotron decay rate . for cyclotron scattering in higher harmonics @xmath4 , the intermediate sums in the vertex functions have the largest contributions from the @xmath5 state . however , for , cyclotron transitions to the ground landau state dominate ( sokolov , zhukovskii & nikitina 1973 , white 1974 , harding & preece 1987 ) , so that cyclotron decay rates for @xmath3 transitions treated in this paper should be good approximations to the widths of excited states , a circumstance pertinent to astrophysical models of magnetars .",
    "this presentation of spin - dependent cyclotron rates appropriately focuses first on the formulation generated using the _ transverse polarization _ eigenstates of the dirac equation derived by sokolov & ternov ( 1968 ) for electrons in a uniform magnetic field * b*. explicit forms for them can also be found in herold , ruder & wunner ( 1982 ) and harding & preece ( 1987 ) , whose exposition on cyclotron emission essentially forms the basis of results developed here .",
    "herold et al . observed that these states diagonalize the operator that describes the electronic self - energy shift in an external magnetic field .",
    "another attractive feature of the sokolov & ternov eigenstates is that they possess charge conjugation symmetries , i.e. between electron ( positive energy ) and positron ( negative energy ) : see eq .",
    "( 12 ) of herold , ruder & wunner ( 1982 ) .",
    "an additional asset of these wavefunctions that is enunciated here is that they yield cyclotron rates whose spin dependence is effectively separable from lorentz transformations along the field : i.e. such boosts do not mix spin states .",
    "this is a very useful characteristic that is not present in the johnson & lippmann formalism addressed in section  [ sec : jlformalism ] below .",

    "<S> cyclotron decay and absorption rates have been well studied in the literature , focusing primarily on spectral , angular and polarization dependence . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical applications usually do not require retention of information on the electron spin state , and these are normally averaged in obtaining the requisite rates . in magnetic fields , higher order quantum processes such as compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequency and its harmonics , with the resonances being formally divergent . </S>",
    "<S> such divergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes of excited landau states . </S>",
    "<S> this practice requires the use of spin - dependent cyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations of process rates very near cyclotronic resonances , the phase space domain most relevant for certain applications to pulsar models . this paper develops previous results in the literature to obtain compact analytic expressions for cyclotron decay rates / widths in terms of a series of legendre functions of the second kind ; these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models . </S>",
    "<S> the rates are derived using two popular eigenstate formalisms , namely that due to sokolov and ternov , and that due to johnson and lippmann . </S>",
    "<S> these constitute two sets of eigenfunctions of the dirac equation that diagonalize different operators , and accordingly yield different spin - dependent cyclotron rates . </S>",
    "<S> this paper illustrates the attractive lorentz transformation characteristics of the sokolov and ternov formulation , which is another reason why it is preferable when electron spin information must be explicitly retained . </S>"
