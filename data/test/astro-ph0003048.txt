    "wolf - rayet stars are surrounded by dense stellar winds giving rise to free - free emission extending from ir to radio wavelengths .",
    "typically , this emission is characterised by a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath2 , with values of the spectral index @xmath3 , and radio brightness temperatures @xmath4  k. a small number of wr stars have radio emission that exhibits quite different properties : negative spectral indices and brightness temperatures @xmath5  k or higher , properties that are characteristic of non - thermal emission .",
    "wr146 is a member of this group , which includes wr125 , wr140 and wr147 .",
    "the radio emission from wr146 was first resolved in high resolution observations with merlin ( dougherty et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "these 5-ghz observations revealed two components , n@xmath6 and s@xmath6 , separated by @xmath7 milli - arcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "the flux of s@xmath6 was consistent with that estimated from extrapolation of the ir - millimetre spectrum arising from the free - free emitting envelope around the wr star .",
    "the brightness temperature of n@xmath6 ( @xmath5k ) identified the nature of the emission from this component as non - thermal .",
    "an optical spectrum showed evidence for absorption lines at h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 , which we attributed to an early - type companion to the wr star .",
    "this led us to hypothesize in paper i that the non - thermal emission arose from a population of relativistic electrons , accelerated in a wind - wind collision region where the wind of the wr star and the companion interacted ( e.g. eichler & usov 1993 ) . to be consistent with such a model",
    ", we suggested the companion lay at the same position angle as n@xmath6 from s@xmath6 , but slightly further away from the wr star .",
    "the presence of a companion was confirmed in optical imaging with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) by niemela et al .",
    "they observed two stars , wr146a and b ( hereafter s@xmath10 and n@xmath10 respectively ) , at the same position angle as the radio sources but separated by @xmath11 mas . under the assumption that the southern sources in both the hst and merlin images are coincident , these observations place the non - thermal source between the two stellar images , strongly supporting wind - wind collision as the origin of the non - thermal emission .",
    "its position relative to the two stellar components ( @xmath12 mas from s@xmath13 and @xmath14 48 mas from n@xmath13 ) is where the dynamical pressure of the two stellar winds is balanced .",
    "this indicates that the momentum of s@xmath13 s stellar wind is @xmath14 0.1 times that of n@xmath13 . with the wind velocity of the wc star in wr146 ( @xmath14 2900 km s@xmath15 , eenens & williams 1994 ) being greater than that of a typical ob star , and the expectation that the mass - loss rate of a wr star would be greater than that of an ob star , this strongly supports the identification of s@xmath13 with the wc6 star in paper i and identifies n@xmath13 with an ob companion having a lesser wind momentum .",
    "the momentum ratio lead niemela et al . to infer that the wind momentum of the companion was more appropriate to a star of early o or of type than a late o - type main - sequence star . taking account of the photometry , they suggested an o6-o5 v - iii spectral type for the companion .",
    "the photometry by niemela et al . showed the two stars to be equally bright in b but that s@xmath10 was redder than n@xmath10 in ( b  v ) and ( u  b ) .",
    "the ( near - zero ) magnitude difference between the two blue images falls between two very different estimates of the wr : o light ratio deduced from spectra of wr146 which included both stars .    on the one hand , in paper i , we measured equivalent widths of h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 in our blue spectrum of wr146 to be @xmath160.9 .",
    "comparison of these with those ( @xmath17 ) typical of mid - to - late o stars in the walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) atlas indicated that the o - star spectrum was diluted and suggested that the continuum of the wc star was twice as bright as that of the o companion in the blue . on the other hand , willis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used a spectrum of lower resolution but longer wavelength coverage than presented in paper i to determine the wr : o light ratio from comparison of the equivalent widths of the emission lines with those of two single wc6 stars .",
    "they found that the o star was _",
    "brighter _ than the wc star , reporting a continuum light ratio ( wr : o ) of 1:(2@xmath181 ) .",
    "the discrepancy in the light ratios of the wc6 and o components derived from the dilution of o star absorption lines and wc6 star emission lines is significant and probably too great to arise purely from the observational uncertainties . leaving aside the question of whether one of the stars varied between the two observations , the principal uncertainties in two spectroscopic light - ratio determinations come from whether the intrinsic line strengths of the components are indeed equal to those of the comparisons adopted .",
    "the discrepancy could be reduced if the equivalent widths of h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 in the o star were weaker than the 2.5  adopted or if the emission lines in the wc6 component were weaker than those of other wc6 stars .",
    "both possibilities are plausible",
    ".    the strengths of the emission lines in wr146 may well be atypical for its wc6 type : both eenens & williams ( 1992 ) and willis et al .",
    "found anomalously low c / he abundances for this star . on the other hand ,",
    "the strengths of h@xmath9 and h@xmath8 in o - type stars do depend on spectral type and luminosity class , which are not known directly for the companion in wr146 .",
    "we note that the `` o8.5v '' adopted by willis et al . comes not from the star s spectral lines but from its luminosity inferred from that of the wc6 star and the continuum light ratio .",
    "we therefore re - observed the blue spectrum of wr146 with the william herschel telescope in an attempt to determine the spectral type and , hopefully , luminosity of the early - type companion to the wr star .",
    "these data , together with the photometry by niemela et al .",
    ", will give us a better idea of the intrinsic properties of the companion for comparison with the radio observations .",
    "we also re - observed wr146 at radio wavelengths , extending the frequency coverage of paper i , to search for the wind flux from the companion , and study the characteristics of the two previously observed radio components with the aim of furthering our understanding of the colliding wind phenomenon .",
    "multi - frequency observations of wr146 at 1.4 , 5 , 8.4 , and 22 ghz were taken on 1996 october 26 using the a - configuration of the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "observations of the nearby radio - bright quasar 2005 + 403 were interleaved with the observations of the target source for phase - referenced calibration of the antennae gains .",
    "the absolute flux scale was determined by observation of 3c48 , assumed to have fluxes of 15.970 , 5.516 , 3.226 and 1.174 jy at 1.4 , 5 , 8.4 , and 22 ghz respectively .",
    "in addition , archival data from merlin at 5 ghz have been analysed .",
    "a 4-hour on - source observation at 5 ghz was obtained with merlin on 1992 december 26 , along with frequent observations of the phase calibration source 2005 + 403 . following the standard procedure for calibrating merlin 5-ghz data ,",
    "the flux scale was established by observation of 3c286 with an assumed total flux of 7.309jy ( 7.020 jy on the mk2-tabley baseline ) and the unresolved source 0552 + 398 , which had a derived `` bootstrap '' flux of 5.786 jy .",

    ". the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale ( @xmath14 a few % ) is not included and , for at least the higher fluxes , will be an important source of uncertainty .",
    "it is possible to check the accuracy of the derived flux scales in the 5- and 8.4-ghz observations .",
    "comparison of the `` bootstrap '' fluxes of 2005 + 403 at these frequencies to those given in the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory ( umrao ) flux database shows that , where closely contemporaneous observations are available , the agreement with umrao fluxes at these frequencies is within @xmath27 . given the excellent agreement at these two frequencies , it is reasonable to assume that the flux scales at the other observed frequencies are good .    aside from the initial amplitude calibration of the merlin observations ,",
    "the calibration and subsequent imaging of the data were carried out using the nrao aips software package .",
    "the complex antennae gains were initially derived for 2005 + 403 and then interpolated ( phase - referenced ) to the observations of wr146 .",

    "gaussian model fits to the visibilities give the diameter of the radio emitting regions as @xmath28 and @xmath29  mas respectively ( see paper i for a description of the method ) .",
    "the large relative uncertainty in these sizes is a direct consequence of the high rms uncertainty per visibility at 22 ghz .",

    "qualitatively , the 1992 merlin image is consistent with the 5-ghz observation from 1995 april 29 ( paper i ) though there is some evidence that n@xmath6 may have decreased in flux by @xmath31  mjy between 1992 and 1995 .",
    "the flux of s@xmath6 appears to have decreased between the two epochs .",
    "however , the difference is only @xmath32 , much less than the @xmath33 threshold typically adopted as evidence for variation . therefore , we adopt the mean value of @xmath34 mjy for the flux of s@xmath6",
    ". variations in the total 5-ghz emission from wr146 have been observed using the wsrt over the last decade that are attributed to variations in the non - thermal component ( setia - gunawan et al .",

    "each of the hydrogen lines is blended with the nearby member of the pickering series of heii but the relative weakness of the unblended odd - numbered pickering line at 4200  and the closer proximity of the hydrogen - line wavelengths to the observed wavelengths suggests that the heii contribution is relatively small .",
    "heliumi is represented by the @xmath35 4472 and 4026  lines ; the latter is blended with heii and is therefore not very useful for diagnostic purposes .",
    "other hei lines in the walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) atlas of hot - star spectra are not seen in our spectrum .",
    "the relative strength of the @xmath36 4070  ciii triplet is a little surprising but the continuum here is uncertain as it falls between two emission features from the wc6 spectrum .    in order to establish the continuum in the regions of each of the absorption lines so that we could measure their equivalent widths , we compared our rectified spectrum with that of another wc6 star , wr15 ( hd 79573 ) , artificially diluted so as to match the spectrum of wr146 .",
    "the spectrum of wr15 was observed with the 1.9 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory and will be discussed elsewhere . as a by - product of this matching , we estimated the dilution of the wc6 spectrum in wr146 , finding ob : wr @xmath37 3 , consistent with the ratio , ob : wr @xmath382@xmath391 , found by willis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from stronger emission lines between 4660  and 6560 .",
    "we are chary of putting too much weight on this result as it depends heavily on the rectification process and the presumption that the wc6 emission lines in wr146 have the same strengths as those in wr15 .",
    "instead , we concentrate on the absorption lines , to be discussed below .      to investigate the nature of the ob companion , we begin by using the helium - line ratios to estimate its spectral type .",
    "our optical spectrum includes contributions from both n@xmath10 and s@xmath10 but the ratios of the absorption lines in the companion will be equal to those measured from our combined - light spectrum , and independent of the dilution by the wr star , provided that the dilution does not change significantly over the wavelength range of the spectrum .",
    "formal o - star spectra classification is based on the ratio of the @xmath364541  he and @xmath404472he lines .",
    "since the former was not available , we used the @xmath404200  he line from the same series .",
    "we formed an empirical calibration of @xmath364472/@xmath364200  ratios against spectral type using the line strengths measured for a large ( @xmath41 100 ) sample of o stars by conti & alschuler ( 1971 ) and conti ( 1973 ) . using this calibration",
    ", the ratio of our measured equivalent widths ( table [ opt ] ) indicates a type of o8 , with an uncertainty of half a subclass .",
    "the type is close to that inferred by willis et al . from their ob : wr light ratio and an average luminosity for the wc6 star ; but this agreement is fortuitous .",
    "the luminosity class criterion adopted by conti & alschuler for the middle and late - type o stars was the ratio of the siiv @xmath404089  and hei @xmath404143  lines .",
    "unfortunately , the silicon line is too weak ( w@xmath42 0.06 ) to measure with confidence and the @xmath404143  line is not seen at all .",
    "another significant hei line that is apparently missing is the @xmath404388  singlet line .",
    "the strength of this relative to that of the @xmath404472  hei line ( `` singlet to triplet ratio '' ) has long been known to be sensitive to luminosity owing to the relative overpopulation of the hei 2@xmath43 state in extended atmospheres ( e.g. voels et al .",
    "1989 and references therein ) . using the equivalent - width measurements by conti & alschuler ( 1971 ) and conti ( 1973 ) ,",
    "we examined the ratios , w@xmath44= w@xmath45(@xmath464388)/w@xmath45(@xmath404472 ) , formed from their observations of the o7.5 , o8 and o8.5 stars in their sample .",
    "this ratio was found to be a strong diagnostic for of stars .",
    "all the o7.58.5 stars having w@xmath47 are of stars , most of them supergiants .",
    "measurement of the @xmath404472  line and examination of our spectrum in the region of the @xmath404388line indicates that w@xmath44 @xmath48 0.2 , strongly suggesting that the o8 star in wr146 is an of star , and possibly a supergiant .",
    "unfortunately , the classical of diagnostic emission features ciii @xmath49463041  and heii @xmath404686fall within the strong @xmath40 4650  ciii - iv / heii emission feature from the wc6 star , which extends from 4620  to 4690   in wr146 ( dessart et al .",
    "this increases the dilution of the ob spectrum to @xmath14 1:4 in this critical region and we can not make a formal of classification",
    ".    further circumstantial support for a high luminosity for the ob star comes from comparison of the @xmath404472  hei to h@xmath50 ratio with those derived from the conti & alschuler and conti ( 1973 ) datasets . on the other hand , we do not observe emission lines corresponding to the ` unidentified ' features observed in o6o9.7 supergiants , including the o8if star hd151804 ( crowther & bohannan 1997 ) , at 4486and 4504 .",
    "also , the weakness of the si @xmath364089  line is surprising given the other evidence for high luminosity , but not unique : the siiv line is barely visible in the spectrum of the o7iaf star sanduleak 80 ( walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) .",
    "although we can not assign a luminosity class , the spectrum points to an extended atmosphere and high luminosity , but not as high as that of hd151804 .      with a better idea of the nature of the o8 star , can we reconcile the measured absorption - line strengths in our composite spectrum with the observations by niemela et al .",
    "we follow paper i and niemela et al . by assigning the northern optical image ( n@xmath10 ) to the o8 star on the basis of its closer proximity to the non - thermal radio source and the assumption that its stellar wind has a lower momentum than that of the wc6 star .",
    "if we assume that the spectrum of s@xmath10 is that of a wc6 star , we can estimate the intrinsic equivalent widths in the o8 spectrum from those observed in our combined - light spectrum and niemela et al.s photometry of s@xmath10 and n@xmath10 .",
    "we find 1.4  for the intrinsic equivalent width of h@xmath50 , which is closer to the average of those measured by conti ( 1973 ) for o8f stars ( 1.3@xmath390.3 ) than for ` non - of ' o8iii  v stars ( 2.5@xmath390.2 ) , another indication of high luminosity properties for the ob star . our earlier view ( paper i ) that the wc6 star was brighter than the ob star was based on the erroneous assumption of intrinsic absorption - line strengths appropriate for a main - sequence ob star .",
    "the observation of approximately equal b magnitudes for n@xmath10 and s@xmath10 is not consistent with the light ratios derived from dilution of the emission - line spectrum of the wc6 star by willis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and supported by our estimate in section 2.1 .",
    "this could be resolved also if the emission lines in the wc6 component were 3040% weaker than those typical of wc6 stars .",
    "this is plausible ; as already noted , the star appears to have an abnormally low c / he abundance ratio and the dilution analysis by willis et al .",
    "depends heavily on ciii and civ lines .",
    "therefore , the very different light ratios originally derived from combined - light spectra in paper i and by willis et al . can be reconciled with a model in which wr146 comprises two stars of approximately equal brightness in the blue and relatively weak lines , those of n@xmath10 being consistent with other indicators of its high luminosity .",
    "the h@xmath50 strength ( together with hst photometry ) , the hei singlet - to - triplet line ratio , and the very high mass - loss rate all point to an extended atmosphere for n@xmath10 .",
    "if it is single , it can not be a main - sequence star but must be luminous .",
    "alternatively , it may itself be an unresolved binary comprising an o8 star with a third component .",
    "if n@xmath10 was a single , luminous star , we can estimate its absolute magnitude from those of o8i / f and o8iii stars ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 , conti 1988 ; vacca , garmany & shull 1996 ) .",
    "for example , combination of an intermediate luminosity , @xmath53 , which might be appropriate given the apparent absence of the ` unidentifed ' 4486  and 4504   emission lines , with the photometry by niemela et al .",
    "would give @xmath54 for s@xmath10 and a combined @xmath55 for the wr146 system .",
    "the implied luminosity of the wc6 star , @xmath56 or @xmath57 on the narrow - band @xmath58 system used for wr stars , is significantly greater than those of other wc6 stars ( e.g. mean @xmath59 , van der hucht , in preparation ) , but this may be another manifestation of the anomalous nature of the wc6 star in wr146 .    adopting a reddening of @xmath60 , consistent with paper i and willis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the combined @xmath61 implies a distance modulus @xmath62 , greater than our distance in paper i ( @xmath63 ) but consistent with membership of the cyg ob2 association ( @xmath62 , massey & thompson 1991 ; torres - dodgen , tapia & carroll 1991 ) .",
    "given the angular distance ( @xmath64 ) of wr146 from the centre of the association , stronger evidence is needed to confirm membership .    at this distance",
    "( 1.7 kpc ) , the mass - loss rates derived for the wc6 and o8 stars are very high : @xmath65 m@xmath66y@xmath15 and @xmath67 m@xmath66y@xmath15 respectively .",
    "the latter is three times that of hd151804 , whereas the luminosity of n@xmath10 appears to be lower .",
    "such a system would have stronger emission lines that those in hd151804 , contrary to observations ( e.g. 4486  and 4504  or h@xmath68 in dessart et al . 2000 , fig 4 compared with crowther & bohannan 1997 ) , so the single high - luminosity model for n@xmath10 is problematic .",
    "if we consider n@xmath10 to be an unresolved binary in which some of the mass - loss is contributed by a third component , the latter is unlikely to be another o - type star .",
    "since @xmath69 for o stars ( howarth & prinja 1987 ) , we expect the mass - loss rate of an o+o system to be lower than that of a single star having the same total luminosity . also , the intrinsic strengths of the h@xmath50 lines from two lower luminosity stars are likely to be greater , in conflict with our combined - light spectrum and the hst photometry .",
    "a model wherein the third component is another wc star suffers neither of these problems .",
    "its spectral subtype would have to be similar to that of s@xmath10 , or it would have to be fainter , not to have been detected in the combined - light spectra . its presence could account for some of the anomalous properties ( e.g. low c / he ) of the wc6 star reported in the studies referred to .",
    "it could also modulate the wind of the o8 star flowing towards the wind interaction region , providing a mechanism for the 3.38-y variability in the non - thermal emission reported by setia gunawan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . to examine this model , separate spectra of n@xmath10 and s@xmath10 , e.g. with an adaptive optics system , are needed to see whether n@xmath10 has a wc companion ( or of emission lines ) and to determine its spectrum without dilution .",
    "from high - resolution observations with the vla at 22 ghz and with merlin at 5 ghz we have observed all three components of the wr146 system : the ob and wc6 stellar winds and the non - thermal source where they collide .",
    "the source geometry and ratio of stellar wind fluxes allow us to determine the ratios of mass - loss rates and wind velocities independent of distance to the system . from these ratios and the observations of the wc6 star ,",
    "we derive the wind velocity of the ob star to be @xmath70 kms@xmath15 and its mass - loss rate to be one quarter that of the wc6 star .",
    "if the wc6 star has an `` average '' wr - star mass - loss rate of @xmath71  m@xmath72y@xmath15 , that of the ob star would be @xmath73  m@xmath72y@xmath15 , suggesting a very high luminosity object .",
    "support for high luminosity comes from the optical spectrum of wr146 , which includes both stars .",
    "this shows absorption - line ratios formed in the ob companion suggesting it to be a high - luminosity o8 star . if it is a single star , the inferred luminosity places wr146 at the distance of the cyg ob2 association",
    "this gives an anomalously high luminosity for the wc6 star but , given its other anomalies , does not rule out this distance .",
    "however , the mass - loss rates determined using this distance ( @xmath65 m@xmath66y@xmath15 for the wc6 star and @xmath74 m@xmath66y@xmath15 for the o8 star ) are awkwardly high and the latter is probably inconsistent with the spectroscopy .",
    "many , if not all , of the observations could be explained if the companion was itself a binary comprising an o8 star and another wc star .",
    "this needs to be tested by separate spectra of the two visual components of wr146 .",
    "the presence of an unresolved companion to the o8 star could modulate its wind so as to cause the 3.38-y variability in the non - thermal emission reported by setia gunawan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "we may not have reached a firm conclusion as to the nature of the stellar companion(s ) to the wc star from the new radio and optical observations .",
