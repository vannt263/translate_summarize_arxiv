    "what does it mean for an effect to be negligible ?",
    "this was the overarching question of a course we designed and taught to freshmen in their second semester at uc berkeley through the compass project .",
    "@xcite to answer it , students must develop a sophisticated understanding of two important , interrelated physics concepts : measurement uncertainty and models .",
    "we used a thermal expansion experiment as a tool for facilitating this understanding .",
    "the phenomena relevant to the experiment ( thermal expansion , elastic stretching , tension , and gravity ) are familiar to students with only an introductory physics background .",
    "thus this simple , low - cost experiment provides an accessible context for beginning students to tackle an abstract and sophisticated question about physics , _",
    "i.e. _ , what it means for an effect to be negligible . in this work , we present a detailed description of the experiment .",
    "thermal expansion is ubiquitous in our everyday lives , playing an important role in everything from rising sea levels  @xcite to the design of bridges  @xcite and the performance of steel beam structures during fires .",
    "@xcite unsurprisingly , experiments and demonstrations for teaching about thermal expansion abound .",
    "recent examples include optical measurements of the expansion of copper ,  @xcite qualitative demonstrations of the contraction of rubber ,  @xcite and techniques for measuring thermal expansion of very cold two - dimensional samples .",
    "@xcite we focus on a previously proposed thermal expansion experiment detailed in refs .  [ 9 , 10 ] . a wire is pulled taut between two fixed anchors and a hanging mass is attached to its midpoint ( fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] ) .",
    "as the wire is heated , it expands ,  @xcite causing the hanging mass to drop lower to the ground . by measuring the change in height of the mass",
    ", one can determine the change in length of the wire and hence its coefficient of thermal expansion .",
    "we analyze two important sources of uncertainty that affect this experiment but have been ignored by previous studies :  @xcite the mass and elasticity of the wire . to account for their contributions to the height of the load , we explore different models of the wire , including an idealized model which assumes a stiff , massless wire and a more realistic one which treats the wire as both massive and elastic .",
    "we describe how the wire s mass and elasticity affect measurement of the thermal expansion coefficient and determine the conditions under which their effects are negligible .",
    "we aim to determine the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath3 of a wire with length @xmath4 at room temperature @xmath5 . ignoring effects that are nonlinear in temperature , the expansion coefficient satisfies  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the change in length of the wire due to an increase in its temperature by @xmath8 . for lengths and temperatures that are easy to achieve in a classroom",
    ", @xmath7 is very small .",
    "therefore , we use the geometry in fig .  [ fig : schematic ] to amplify the effects of thermal expansion .  @xcite the wire is stretched horizonatally between two anchors and pulled taut by hand .",
    "a load of mass @xmath9 is attached to its midpoint .",
    "the wire expands as it heated , causing the load to drop lower to the ground by a distance @xmath10 .",
    "a small change in the wire s length corresponds to a relatively large @xmath10 .",
    "for example , increasing the temperature of a 175 cm wire by 100  k results in only a 3  mm change in length but causes the load to drop by about 7  cm .",
    "the tradeoff for this order - of - magnitude increase in the size of the effect is that the mass and elasticity of the wire lead to systematic errors in determination of @xmath3 .",
    "studying these two sources of uncertainty is one of the major goals of the present work .     experimental apparatus .",
    "the ends of a wire are attached to blocks of wood via small metal hooks .",
    "both blocks are fastened to a level , rigid surface ( not shown ) via c - clamps .",
    "insulated copper wires are attached to the hooks to facilitate electrical connections to an ac power supply , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "our apparatus is an adaptation of similar setups used in refs .  [",
    "9 ] and [ 10 ] . ]    in this section , we present three models of the wire : stiff and massless , elastic and massless , and elastic and massive .",
    "we also outline analytical and empirical methods for determining when the effects of the wire s elasticity and mass are negligible .",
    "the simplest model of the wire is one that neglects its mass and elasticity .",
    "this model is valid when the wire is sufficiently stiff that elastic stretching is negligible compared to thermal expansion , and when the mass of the load is much larger than that of the wire . as we discuss in section  [ sec : wiremass ] , modeling the wire as massless is equivalent to assuming that it hangs in the shape of a triangle  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "therefore , the change in length @xmath11 of the wire is related to the vertical displacement @xmath10 of the load by the pythagorean theorem : @xmath12 where terms of order @xmath13 have been neglected since @xmath14 is negligible compared to the precision of @xmath15 achieved in this experiment ( section  [ sec : results ] ) . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : geomean ] ) shows , @xmath10 is proportional to the geometric mean of @xmath4 and @xmath16 .",
    "hence the displacement of the load is much larger than the actual change in length of the wire .    by modeling the wire as stiff , we assume that its elongation is due only to thermal expansion , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17",
    ". solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thermal ] ) and ( [ eq : geomean ] ) for the coefficient of thermal expansion yields  @xcite @xmath18 where the subscript  0 \" is included to distinguish eq .",

    "is suspended from the midpoint of a taut wire ( solid black lines ) .",
    "the wire is connected in series with an ac power supply and an ammeter .",
    "dashed blue lines indicate electrical connections and thick red arrows represent the forces experienced by the load . ]",
    "the effects of elastic stretching are apparent at room temperature  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : catenary ] ) : the wire stretches under the weight of the load , resulting in a nonzero displacement @xmath19 when @xmath20",
    ". therefore , eqns .",
    "( [ eq : thermal ] ) and ( [ eq : geomean ] ) imply that @xmath21 .",
    "we present a more realistic model that accounts for elastic stretching of the wire . in this case , there are two contributions to the wire s change in length : @xmath22 where @xmath7 and @xmath23 are the contributions from thermal and elastic effects , respectively .",
    "to model elastic stretching , we rely on hooke s law :  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the tension in the wire and @xmath26 is the wire s spring constant , which we assume to be independent of temperature .    thermal expansion and elastic stretching can be discriminated from one another based on their different scaling with @xmath10 .",
    "we solve for @xmath7 and @xmath23 in terms of @xmath10 as follows .",
    "for a massless wire , the vertical component of the tension in the wire must exactly balance the weight of the load : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hooke ] ) and ( [ eq : balance ] ) and using the small angle approximation @xmath29 , we find @xmath30 substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dl ] ) and ( [ eq : dlm ] ) into ( [ eq : geomean ] ) and solving for @xmath7 yields @xmath31 finally , solving eqs .",

    "( [ eq : geomean ] ) and ( [ eq : dlm ] ) when @xmath20 and hence @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , by measuring @xmath19 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alphaem ] ) and ( [ eq : k ] ) allow us to account for elastic stretching when determining the thermal expansion coefficient and to measure the spring constant of the wire in a straightforward way .    to understand the conditions under which the elastic wire model presented here reduces to the stiff model presented in section  [ sec : stiff ] , we define the following dimensionless parameter : @xmath36 the approximation , which is valid when @xmath37 and @xmath38 , follows from solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alphasm ] ) and ( [ eq : k ] ) for @xmath10 and @xmath19 , respectively . writing eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphaem ] ) as @xmath39 shows that @xmath40 represents the fractional correction to @xmath41 due to the wire s elasticity .",
    "when @xmath40 is negligibly small , so , too , are the effects of elastic stretching . for a particular wire with fixed @xmath4 , @xmath26 , and @xmath3 , such a regime is realized for sufficiently large temperature differences ; as @xmath8 increases , elongation due to thermal expansion relaxes the wire tension and hence decreases @xmath23 .",
    "although decreasing the load s mass has a similar effect , our analysis may not be valid if @xmath9 is too small because the massless wire model is only applicable when the load is very heavy compared to the wire .",
    "effects of the wire s elasticity and mass .",
    "when the wire is at room temperature ( upper , blue lines ) , the displacement @xmath19 of the load is nonzero due to elastic stretching of the wire .",
    "the displacement @xmath10 of a hot wire ( lower , red lines ) is due to a combination of elastic and thermal effects . in the massless wire approximation",
    ", the wire hangs in a triangle ( dashed lines ) .",
    "a massive wire , on the other hand , hangs in the shape of a loaded catenary ( solid lines ) . ]      to take the wire s mass into account , we model the shape of the hanging wire as an elastic , loaded catenary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : catenary ] ) . in the limit that the load is much heavier than the wire",
    ", the loaded catenary closely resembles a triangle and eq .",
    "( [ eq : geomean ] ) is valid .",
    "however , in general , numerical analysis is needed to determine how the length of the loaded catenary depends on the displacement and mass of the load , and the mass and elasticity of the wire .",
    "@xcite    rather than use a numerical approach to probe the regime of applicability of the elastic , massless wire model , we adopt an empirical one .",
    "one of the predictions of that model is that the quantity @xmath42 is independent of @xmath9 ; indeed , eq .  ( [ eq : k ] ) implies that @xmath43 is constant and equal to @xmath44 .",
    "however , there are two limits in which @xmath43 is not constant : when the load is too light , the wire can not be modeled as massless and eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) is not valid , and ; in the opposite limit of a very heavy load , the wire may undergo nonlinear elastic deformation or it may be permanently stretched through plastic deformation , invalidating hooke s law  ( [ eq : hooke ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 deviates from its constant value in both cases .",
    "we therefore use the scaling of @xmath43 with @xmath9 as an indicator for the breakdown of the elastic , massless wire approximation : for light loads , an observed dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath9 is evidence that the wire s mass can not be neglected ; for heavy loads , such a dependence indicates a breakdown of hooke s law .",

    "error bars in this and subsequent figures represent statistical uncertainties . ]    our apparatus ( fig .",
    "[ fig : apparatus ] ) consisted of : a 24  awg nichrome wire with mass of 3  g and length of 175  cm ; a set of hanging weights with masses 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.5 , and 1.0  kg ; a 400  w variable ac power supply capable of supplying up to 9  a ( rms ) of current ; a digital handheld thermocouple probe thermometer ( omega engineering model hh11b ) ; two wooden blocks ( 2``@xmath471''@xmath4712 \" ) with metal hooks ; two c - clamps ; electrical wires ; an ammeter ; a ruler with millimeter precision ; and a small mirror .",
    "the ends of the wire were attached to the hooks on the wooden blocks .",
    "the blocks were secured to a table with the c - clamps , pulling the wire taut in the process .",
    "a load of variable mass was achieved by attaching different combinations of the hanging weights to the wire s midpoint .",
    "we affixed the ruler to the edge of the table about 1.5  cm behind the center of the wire and placed the mirror behind the ruler to minimize parallax error .",
    "each end of the wire was connected to the ac power supply  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) , and current was run through the wire causing its temperature to increase due to resistive heating . by varying the current from 0 to 9  a , we achieved temperature differences of up to 550  k. the large currents and high temperatures involved in the experiment warrant various safety precautions , such as installing a 10  a fuse on the power supply and exercising care near the hot wire .",
    "we measured the temperature of the wire in 4 places spaced 35  cm apart from each other and from the ends of the wire .",
    "we performed two experiments .",
    "the first experiment was an empirical probe of the limits of the massless wire model by measuring the displacement @xmath19 of the load at room temperature as a function of load mass @xmath9 ( section  [ sec : wiremass ] ) .",
    "the second experiment was a determination of nichrome s thermal expansion coefficient @xmath3 by measuring the displacement @xmath10 of the load as a function of the wire s temperature change @xmath8 .",
    "for this second measurement , data were analyzed according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alphaem ] ) and ( [ eq : k ] ) , which are valid when the wire is massless and elastic ( section  [ sec : k ] ) . for a given @xmath9 and @xmath8",
    ", measurements of @xmath10 and @xmath19 were repeated 3 to 5 times and we assumed the statistical uncertainty in determination of the displacement was given by the standard error of the mean of the repeated measurements .",
    "statistical uncertainties were scaled to give a reduced chi - squared of unity when computing averages ; scale factors were on the order of unity , indicating a good fit between models and data .",
    "uncertainties in the calculated quantities ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath3 ) were determined using standard error propagation methods .",
    "@xcite    we measured the displacement of the load relative to the position of the midpoint of the taut , unloaded wire .",
    "this choice of reference for the displacement leads to a systematic uncertainty of about @xmath48  mm in @xmath10 and @xmath19 due to sag and kinks in the unloaded wire , which is the dominant source of uncertainty in determination of @xmath26 and @xmath3 ( table  [ tab : budget ] ) .",
    "future experiments should be improved by using a more accurate reference from which to measure the load s displacement .",
    "systematic effects that lead to gradual increase of the load s displacement over time may introduce biases in our measurements .",
    "one possible mechanism for such an effect is plastic deformation of the hot wire under heavy loads , causing the wire to permanently increase in length .",
    "alternatively , the large forces on the wooden blocks due to the high tension in the wire could cause the blocks ( and hence the ends of the wire ) to shift closer together . following the prescription of ref .",
    "[ 18 ] , we randomized the order of the trials in each experiment to minimize measurement biases due to these effects .",
    "randomized trials were altered to avoid repetition of the same values of @xmath9 and @xmath8 on successive trials .",
    "the goal of the first experiment was to empirically determine the minimum load mass @xmath9 that was still sufficiently heavy that the wire s mass could be neglected . to this end , we measured @xmath19 as a function of @xmath9 at room temperature .",
    "the massless wire model is valid when the quantity @xmath49 is constant with respect to @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the fluctuations between neighboring data points are smaller than the measurement uncertainty . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : k ] , such is the case when @xmath46  kg , implying that the wire s mass was negligible in this regime .",

    "( [ eq : k ] ) gives @xmath50  n / cm , where the quantity in parentheses is the uncertainty in the last digit . the measured spring constant is lower than what one might expect based on nichrome s elastic modulus : @xmath51  n / cm , where @xmath52  n / m@xmath53 is nichrome s elastic modulus and @xmath54  mm@xmath55 is the wire s cross - sectional area .",
    "@xcite this discrepancy may be due to kinks in the wire which straighten elastically under tension .",
    "in this first experiment , during which all the data were collected at room temperature , there was no evidence of plastic deformation of the wire or shifting of the wooden blocks .",
    "furthermore , we did not observe a dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath9 for heavy loads , indicating that hooke s law is valid for masses up to at least 1.1  kg .",
    "the purpose of the second experiment was to measure nichrome s thermal expansion coefficient @xmath3 .",
    "we measured @xmath10 as a function of @xmath8 and used eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphaem ] ) to determine @xmath3 , using a 0.7  kg load to ensure that the wire s mass could be neglected in our analysis . a weighted average of the data in fig .  [ fig : alpha ] yields @xmath56  @xmath1m / m@xmath2k , which is consistent with the accepted value of nichrome s thermal expansion coefficient , 17.3  @xmath1m / m@xmath2k .",
    "@xcite the precision with which we were able to measure @xmath3 was limited by the uncertainty in measurement of the displacement of the load and the room - temperature length of the wire ( table  [ tab : budget ] ) .",

    "because our data yield nonzero measurements of @xmath40 over a broad range of temperatures , the stiff wire regime is not realized in our experiment . ]    for fixed @xmath8 , we observed a systematic increase in @xmath10 by about 5% over the course of the experiment , suggesting that the wire was undergoing plastic deformation .",
    "a similar pattern was observed in the room temperature displacement @xmath19 , which we measured various times throughout the second experiment .",
    "we suspect that kinks in the wire were plastically straightened at high temperatures , a process that would increase the effective spring constant of the wire relative to that observed in the first experiment . indeed ,",
    "the values of @xmath19 measured in this experiment correspond to @xmath59  n / cm .",
    "the impact of measurement bias due to plastic straightening of the kinks did not significantly affect the accuracy of our experiment .",

    "the wire is negligible in our experiment , we compare our measurement precision to the fractional correction to the stiff wire model due to the wire s elasticity , _",

    "we find that @xmath40 varies from 0.5 when @xmath60  k to 0.1 when @xmath61  k ( fig .",

    "elastic stretching is non - negligible in our experiment .",
    "using the thermal expansion experiment described here , we explored the regime of applicability of three models of a wire : stiff and massless , elastic and massless , and elastic and massive .",
    "we employed empirical and analytical techniques to develop quantitative conditions for when the mass and elasticity of the wire can be neglected and demonstrated that , for our experiment , the wire s elasticity can not be neglected .",
    "we achieved a measurement of nichrome s coefficient of linear thermal expansion that was consistent with the accepted value at the 8% level .",
    "the dominant sources of uncertainty in our experiment were measurement of the change in height of the load and the room - temperature length of the wire , likely due to kinks in the wire .",
