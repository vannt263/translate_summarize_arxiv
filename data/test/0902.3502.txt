    "quantum gravity is one of the goals of high energy physics .",
    "now , we have some promising approaches to understand quantum gravity , such as string theory and loop quantum gravity . but",
    "to study simple models of gravity is also a hopeful direction to reveal the realistic quantum gravity .",
    "for example , three dimensional gravity is simpler than our universe because there is no gravitational degree of freedom in three dimensions .",
    "but if a massive particle is coupled with three dimensional gravity , the geometry is deformed conically @xcite .",
    "thus , it might be interesting if we consider the quantization of such massive particles because the background geometry itself seems to be fluctuated .",
    "so far , many works about the quantization have been done . in @xcite ,",
    "quantum mechanics of the massive particles coupled with three dimensional einstein gravity has been considered . in @xcite",
    ", the authors have quantized the moduli space of three dimensional chern - simons gauge theory coupled with particles and derived a general expression for the scattering cross section of the gravitating particles . in @xcite , more general moduli space of three dimensional chern - simons gauge theory",
    "have been considered .",
    "these works have contributed to the first quantization of the massive particles in three dimensions .",
    "the field theoretical description of the massive particles in three dimensions has appeared in @xcite .",
    "the authors have considered the ponzano - regge model @xcite with which spinless massive particles are coupled and have shown that the effective field theory of the ponzano - regge model is given by three dimensional noncommutative scalar field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative space @xmath0=2i\\kappa \\epsilon^{ijk}{\\hat{x}}_k ~(i , j , k=1,2,3)$ ] with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a gravitational constant .",
    "this result means that the three dimensional noncommutative field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative space might give the quantum dynamics of spinless massive particles coupled with the three dimensional gravity .",
    "if this conjecture is correct , it is natural to expect that the lorentzian extension of the noncommutative field theory gives the quantum dynamics of spinless massive particles in 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we examine whether there exists the relation between spinless massive particles coupled with @xmath3 dimensional einstein gravity and the lorentzian version of the noncommutative field theory .",
    "it is known that the 2 + 1 dimensional noncommutative field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative spacetime @xmath0=2i\\kappa \\epsilon^{ijk}{\\hat{x}}_k ~(i , j , k=0,1,2)$ ] possesses an @xmath4 group momentum space @xcite .",
    "since it has been reported in @xcite that spinless massive particles coupled with the 2 + 1 dimensional gravity possess an @xmath4 group momentum space , the noncommutative field theory seems to give the quantum dynamics of such spinless massive particles .",
    "however , we point out that full momentum space of the spinless massive particles is generally different from @xmath4 group space because there are arbitrary negative energy particle solutions in the 2 + 1 dimensional gravity .",
    "in fact , we show that the statement  spinless massive particles in 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity possess an @xmath4 group momentum space \" is correct only when masses of the particles are positive and the total energy is not over @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ subsec : static ] , we review a static spinless massive particle solution in 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity . in section [ subsec : geo ]",
    ", we review the geometric approach @xcite which gives the way to construct the spinless massive moving particles in 2 + 1 dimensions . in section [ subsec :",
    "gmomenta ] , we point out that the momentum space of the spinless massive particles can be written by the @xmath4 group space only when masses of the particles are positive and the total energy is not over @xmath5 .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary and comments .",
    "let us remind a static spinless massive particle solution in 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath6 where the range of @xmath7 is @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the mass of the particle . since this metric is locally flat",
    ", we can obtain the classical solution if we start with flat minkowski space , cut out a wedge with opening angle @xmath10 , and identify the opposite edges . since @xmath11 should be less than @xmath12",
    ", @xmath9 has an upper bound , @xmath13 however , arbitrary negative values of @xmath9 are permitted because there is no lower bound of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , a particle coupled with 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity can possess arbitrary negative mass .      to consider moving massive particles coupled with 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity , it is convenient to introduce the geometrical approach @xcite",
    ".    let us reconsider the static spinless massive one - particle solution .",
    "such a solution is determined by the matching condition which is expressed by identifying points @xmath14 and @xmath15 along the edges which are related by the rotation matrix @xmath16 as in figure [ fig : static1 ] ,     means the identification of the points @xmath14 and @xmath15 . ]",
    "@xmath17    where @xmath18 denotes the three vector . in this",
    "setting , however , @xmath11 should be restricted to a positive value because of the periodic property of @xmath19 .",
    "of course , @xmath11 can not be taken over @xmath12 .",
    "next , let us consider the two - particle static solution .",
    "the matching conditions for two particles at the origin and at @xmath20 consist in the following identifications as in figure [ fig : static2 ] :    .",
    "the mark @xmath21 and @xmath22 mean the identifications . ]",
    "@xmath23    where @xmath24 we see that the identification ( [ eq:2pid ] ) coincides with a one - particle solution with mass @xmath25 located at @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the total mass should be bounded by @xmath27 so that spacetime with minkowskian metric exists .",
    "finally , we consider two moving particles . since we can not discuss a total momentum of an isolated system , we should study two moving particles in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "let us prepare two local patches whose coordinates are labeled as @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "if a static particle is in each patch , the matching conditions are given by @xmath30 next , we consider the embedding of these two patches into a global frame whose coordinates are labeled by @xmath14 as in figure [ fig : movingparticles ] .",
    "if these particles are moving and located at @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the @xmath33 frame , the relations between these coordinates are @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the lorentz transformations with the boost parameters @xmath36 .",
    "if a particle is moving in @xmath37 direction , the lorentz transformation @xmath38 is written by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a velocity of the particle . from ( [ eq : yidentify])-([eq : xzrel ] ) , the matching conditions for two particles moving with the velocity @xmath41 respectively are the following , @xmath42 note that the matching condition for @xmath14 , which is far from two particles , is given by ( [ eq : centermass1 ] ) .",
    "if we are in the center mass frame , the matching condition should be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is purely spacelike and @xmath45 is a three vector . comparing ( [ eq : centermass1 ] ) and ( [ eq : centermass2 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath46 from ( [ eq : comtotale ] ) , we find the total energy of the center - of - mass frame and the conditions for the center - of - mass frame .      in this section , we show that momentum space of spinless massive particles coupled with 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity is given by an @xmath4 group space only when their masses are positive and the total energy is not over @xmath5",
    ".    we can represent ( [ eq : comtotale ] ) by @xmath4 group elements because @xmath47 is isomorphic to @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath38 represents the boost in @xmath37 direction , @xmath48 is written with @xmath47 lie algebras @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 which satisfy the following commutation relation : ] ] @xmath52=i\\epsilon^{ijk}t_k.\\ ] ]    replacing @xmath53 with @xmath54 lie algebras @xmath55,s are defined by @xmath56 with pauli matrices @xmath57 these matrices satisfy @xmath58 ] ( [ eq : lol-1 ] ) can be represented as @xmath59 with the identification @xmath60 .",
    "if we set @xmath61 we find @xmath62 this seems to allow us to interpret @xmath63 as relativistic momenta of a massive particle in 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "then , we can obtain the total energy of two massive particles in the center - of - mass frame from the product of @xmath4 group elements in the same way as we have done in ( [ eq : comtotale ] ) .",
    "but we must remember that this discussion is only valid when masses of the particles are positive and the total energy is not over @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we have found that the momentum space of spinless massive particles coupled with 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity is given by the @xmath4 group space only when their masses are positive and the total energy is not over @xmath5 .",
    "since the @xmath4 group momentum space does not possess an arbitrary negative energy , this momentum space does not correspond to the negative energy particle solutions as we saw in section [ subsec : static ] .",
    "thus , full momentum space of the spinless massive particles in 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity is much more complicated than @xmath4 group space .",
    "we have shown by using the geometric approach that spinless massive particles in 2 + 1 dimensional einstein gravity possess the @xmath4 group momentum space only when the masses of the particles are positive and the total energy is not over @xmath5 .",
    "this result tells us that the @xmath4 group space does not give the full momentum space of the particles in the 2 + 1 dimensional gravity .",
    "in fact , the @xmath4 group momentum space does not contain the arbitrary negative energy which the particles should possess .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that 2 + 1 dimensional noncommutative field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative spacetime @xmath0=2i\\kappa \\epsilon^{ijk}{\\hat{x}}_k ~(i , j , k=0,1,2)$ ] , which is a lorentzian extension of the effective field theory of the ponzano - regge model with scalar massive particles , possesses the @xmath4 group momentum space .",
    "however , since this theory does not contain the arbitrary negative energy , we conclude that the noncommutative field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative spacetime is not related to the spinless massive particles coupled with 2 + 1 dimensional gravity .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "firstly , we have recently shown that the noncommutative field theory in the lie algebraic noncommutative spacetime is not probably a unitary theory @xcite .",
    "if there is a true quantum gravity theory , it should be consistent with the principle of the quantum mechanics . from this result",
    ", it is unlikely that the noncommutative field theory is the effective field theory of the spinless massive particles coupled with the 2 + 1 dimensional gravity .",
    "secondly , what is the full momentum space of the spinless massive particles in the 2 + 1 dimensional gravity ?",
    "since the periodic property of @xmath4 group forbids the arbitrary negative energy , the universal covering of the @xmath4 seems to be considered as a candidate of the full momentum space of the particles .",
    "however , in this case , we do not know how to understand the upper bound of the total energy .",
    "this problem should remain as a future work .",
