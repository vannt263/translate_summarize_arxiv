    "the concept of nonlinear self - localization is of importance for many physical phenomena , and has appeared in a number of different contexts since the pioneering work by landau @xcite on the polaron problem in the 1930s . in recent years , much attention has been devoted to studies of spatially localized and time - periodic vibrational modes in anharmonic lattices ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite for recent reviews ) . the general existence of such modes , which have been termed _ discrete breathers _ , or _",
    "intrinsic localized modes _ , as robust solutions to nonlinear ( and in general non - integrable ) lattice - equations was suggested in 1988 by takeno _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "later , their existence was rigorously proven under rather general conditions by mackay and aubry @xcite by considering the limit of uncoupled oscillators ( the so called _ anticontinuous _ or _ anti - integrable _ limit ) . by means of the implicit function theorem",
    ", they showed that the trivial solution of a single - site localized vibration at the uncoupled limit could be continued into a localized breather solution for non - zero coupling between the oscillators , provided that the individual oscillators are anharmonic , and that no multiples of the breather frequency resonate with the bands of linear excitations ( phonons ) . as was demonstrated first in @xcite",
    ", the ideas of the rigorous proof can be turned into an efficient numerical scheme to calculate breather solutions to any desired accuracy .",
    "since the discrete breathers appear under very general conditions in anharmonic lattices and provide efficient means of energy localization , they have been proposed as candidates to explain experimentally observed localization of energy in many different physical areas , e.g. dna dynamics @xcite .",
    "although , from a fundamental and mathematical viewpoint , the existence theorems for discrete breathers provide an important cornerstone for understanding the dynamics of anharmonic lattices , it is probably of even larger physical importance to understand the behaviour of a system close to an exact breather solution . by linearizing the lattice - equations around the exact solution , one can obtain an approximate description of the dynamics of weakly perturbed breathers , and in particular the linear stability properties determining whether small perturbations will grow exponentially or not .",
    "it was shown in @xcite,@xcite that the simplest , single - site , breathers are generally linearly stable close to the uncoupled limit , and numerical investigations using standard floquet analysis ( see e.g. @xcite ) have shown that linearly stable breathers typically exist also for rather large values of the inter - site coupling . however , when considering time - scales large compared to the breather period , the mere linear stability of a breather does no longer guarantee the eternal existence of the breather in the presence of small perturbations , and there are still many questions remaining concerning the different mechanisms by which breathers may grow or decay , or possibly finally be destroyed . if the breathers have a finite life - time , the determination of this life - time is of large importance for understanding the role of breathers in real systems .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate in more detail some mechanisms for breather growth and decay in a simple model system , the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation .",
    "the dnls equation is generic in the sense that it describes slowly ( in time ) varying modulational waves in discrete systems in a rotating - wave approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; however , due to its extra symmetry properties ( see sec .  [ sec : perturbation ] ) it exhibits some nongeneric features among discrete systems , e.g. exact quasiperiodic breathers @xcite .",
    "the single - site breathers of the dnls equation are stationary states which are linearly stable for all inter - site coupling , and which reduce to the nls soliton in the continuum limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an important application appears in nonlinear optics , where the single - site dnls - breather describes a discrete spatial soliton in an array of weakly coupled waveguides @xcite ; recent experimental observations @xcite confirm the successful use of the dnls - model in this context .",
    "some recent numerical investigations @xcite have shown that dnls - breathers can be spontaneously created from noisy backgrounds , in a similar manner as was previously observed for klein - gordon @xcite and fpu @xcite lattices .",
    "typically , this spontaneous energy localization was observed to occur in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "a large number of small breathers are created as a result of the modulational instability @xcite of travelling plane waves occurring for certain wave number regimes .",
    "the second step proceeds by inelastic collisions between the breathers , in which systematically the big breathers grow at expense of the smaller ones .",
    "thus , the outcome will be a small number of large breathers , together with some remaining background of small - amplitude ( phonon ) oscillations .",
    "however , it can generally not be concluded from the numerical simulations that this is the true final state of the system , and actually long - time simulations for fpu - chains @xcite revealed also a third step , in which the interaction with the phonon oscillations leads to the final destruction of the breather and equipartition of energy .",
    "thus , to elucidate the nature of the final states for typical initial conditions in anharmonic chains , it is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms for interactions between breathers and small - amplitude perturbations .    in this paper , we take the following approach . as initial state , we consider an exact single - site breather solution , and add a small perturbation corresponding to a time - periodic eigensolution to the equations of motion linearized around the breather .",
    "these solutions , which can be either localized or extended in space , constitute a complete set in which an arbitrary initial perturbation can be expanded .",
    "the localized solutions correspond to internal modes of the breather @xcite , while the excitation of an extended solution corresponds to a standing - wave ( i.e. , non - propagating ) phonon interacting with the breather . in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbation ] we describe the model and outline the perturbational approach which forms the analytical backbone for the interpretation of the numerical results presented in secs .",
    "[ sec : internal ] and [ sec : phonons ] .",
    "[ sec : internal ] discusses the long - time consequences of the interaction between the breather and its internal modes , while sec .",
    "[ sec : phonons ] concerns the interaction between the breather and small - amplitude standing - wave phonons of different wave vectors .",
    "we will find that in both cases , a simple argument based on the conservation laws can be used to obtain a sufficient condition for breather growth . in sec .",
    "[ sec : instabilities ] we discuss another type of mechanism for breather growth and destruction which becomes appreciable when the amplitude of the standing wave is non - negligible ( and consequently the perturbational approach can be expected to fail ) , and which has its origin in the recently discovered oscillatory instabilities of the nonlinear standing - wave phonon themselves @xcite . finally , we make some concluding remarks in sec .

    "[ sec : instabilities ] ) .",
    "the simulations have been performed either by using very large system sizes or by appending damping regions of various sizes to the boundaries ; in all cases we have carefully checked that the boundary conditions have no essential influence on our results .",
    "we consider the following form of the dnls hamiltonian with canonical conjugated variables @xmath0 : @xmath1 this yields the dnls equation @xmath2 which , in addition to the hamiltonian ( [ dnlsham ] ) , also conserves the total _ excitation norm _ ( or _ power _ in nonlinear optics applications ) , @xmath3 the conservation laws for the norm and hamiltonian are , through noether s theorem , related to the invariance of the dnls equation ( or , more precisely , of its corresponding action integral ) under infinitesimal transformations in phase ( @xmath4 ) and time ( @xmath5 ) , respectively . defining the norm density @xmath6 and hamiltonian density @xmath7 as in eqs .",

    "these conservation laws are discrete analogs to those existing for the continuous nls equations with general nonlinearities ( see e.g. @xcite ) , however there is no discrete counterpart to the momentum conservation law since the discrete equation has no continuous translational symmetry in space .",
    "furthermore , we note that the transformation @xmath12 in ( [ dnls ] ) is equivalent to @xmath13 , and thus we will for the rest of this paper only consider @xmath14 without loss of generality .",

    "is known to be a monotonously increasing function of @xmath17 , while the hamiltonian , @xmath24 , is negative and monotonously decreasing ( see e.g. @xcite ) . from the minimization condition",
    ", these functions will be related as @xmath25    to describe the dynamics close to the breather ( [ stationary ] ) , we introduce the following perturbation expansion : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the initial perturbation and @xmath28 . thus , as for the usual stability analysis of stationary states ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the perturbation is applied in a frame rotating with the breather frequency @xmath17 . substituting into eq .",

    "gives the breather shape @xmath16 ( which for the single - site breather can be assumed real and positive without loss of generality ) , while the 1st order equation ( [ 1st ] ) is the linearization of the dnls equation around the breather .      to obtain the solutions to the linearized equations ( [ 1st ] ) ,",
    "we proceed in a similar way as is usually done for continuous generalized nls models ( see e.g.@xcite ) and introduce a substitution of the form @xmath32 so that @xmath33 substituting ( [ subst ] ) into eq .  ( [ 1st ] ) and assuming @xmath34 real yields @xmath35 where the operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 are hermitian .",

    "for an infinite system , the spectrum of the ( non - hermitian ) matrix @xmath54 can generally be divided into a continuous ( phonon ) part , corresponding to extended eigenvectors , and a point spectrum corresponding to localized eigenvectors . the phonon spectrum for any localized solution @xmath16",

    "thus , the continuous spectrum of the matrix @xmath54 consists of two branches , symmetrically located around @xmath64 , and since @xmath65 for the single - site breather these two branches never overlap .",
    "note also that two eigenvectors with eigenvalues @xmath66 correspond to the same solution to eq .",
    "( [ 1st ] ) ( changing the sign of @xmath38 in eq .",

    "when @xmath73 is not too large , the linear spectrum around the single - site breather contains also two pairs of nonzero isolated eigenvalues @xmath38 , which correspond to the two internal modes of the breather @xcite .",
    "one of these modes is a spatially symmetric , breathing , mode , while the other is a spatially antisymmetric , translational or pinning mode .",

    "the numerically calculated internal mode frequencies @xmath38 as a function of breather frequency @xmath17 are shown in fig .",
    "note that as @xmath76 , the breathing mode frequency approaches the lower edge of the phonon band ( but always stays outside the band @xcite ) , while the pinning mode frequency approaches zero ( but always stays nonzero ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the soliton solution of the continuous nls equation has no breathing mode ( due to its exact integrability ) , and has a translational mode with zero frequency due to the translational symmetry of the nls equation .    to obtain a complete set of solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 1st ] ) in which an arbitrary initial perturbation @xmath77 can be expanded , we must include also the zero - frequency solutions , which generally can be written as a superposition of two fundamental modes .",
    "one of these modes ( phase mode @xcite ) is the solution @xmath78 to the homogeneous equation ( [ w_n ] ) , @xmath79 . the corresponding perturbation @xmath80 describes a rotation of the overall phase of the breather .",
    "the second mode ( growth mode @xcite ) is obtained by solving the inhomogeneous equation @xmath81 , which has the solution @xmath82 . the corresponding solution to eq .",
    "( [ 1st ] ) is @xmath83 , and corresponds to a time - linear growth of the perturbation representing a small change in the breather frequency .",
    "although the set of eigensolutions ( [ subst ] ) together with the two zero - frequency modes forms a basis for the space of solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 1st ] ) ( there are no bifurcations , which could result in additional marginal modes @xcite with time - linear growth at degenerate eigenvalues ) , this basis is in general not orthogonal using the ordinary scalar product , and typically there is a considerable overlap between the solution corresponding to the internal breathing mode and the zero - frequency modes .",
    "however , in analogy with e.g. @xcite , we can define a pseudo - scalar product between any two vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 by @xmath86 this product is formally not a true scalar product , since for the general case the product of a vector with itself as defined by ( [ scalar ] ) is not necessarily positive .",
    "however , when @xmath39 is a real eigenvector of @xmath54 we have @xmath87 from ( [ w_n ] ) , and the operator @xmath57 is positive definite for all @xmath88 @xcite . with this product , it follows from ( [ w_n ] ) - ( [ u_n ] ) that all eigensolutions with different ( real ) eigenfrequencies @xmath38 are orthogonal in the sense that @xmath89 and the only nonzero product involving the zero - frequency modes is the cross - product between the phase mode and the growth mode @xcite : @xmath90 where @xmath23 is the norm ( [ norm ] ) of the breather with frequency @xmath17 .",
    "we also remark that , since the product ( [ scalar ] ) multiplied by a factor @xmath91 is just the symplectic product between the two vectors @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the sign of the product of an eigenvector with itself can be interpreted as the negative of the krein signature of the corresponding pair of floquet eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "we now consider as initial state a single - site breather perturbed in the direction of a single eigenmode ( [ subst ] ) ( localized or extended ) of the linearized equations ( [ 1st ] ) , and wish to describe qualitatively the long - time effects of this perturbation using the expansion ( [ perturbation ] ) . in general , taking into account terms up to order @xmath94 in this expansion yields a solution to the dnls equation which is correct to @xmath95 , i.e. , for long but finite time - scales for small initial perturbations ( note that the expansion parameter @xmath29 plays the same role as the mode amplitude @xmath51 . ) . as is wellknown however , this kind of expansion in general diverges due to resonances between solutions to the homogeneous equation ( [ 1st ] ) and the inhomogeneous terms appearing in the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ 2nd])-([4th ] ) and the corresponding higher - order equations . a resonance with a solution belonging to the continuous spectrum results in a bounded but nonlocalized solution corresponding to outgoing radiation , while a resonance with an eigenfunction belonging to the discrete spectrum gives a spatially localized response which diverges linearly in time .",
    "however , up to any finite order these divergences can be systematically removed by allowing a slow time dependence of the independent variables , which in our case are taken to be the mode amplitude @xmath51 and the breather frequency @xmath17 .",
    "this procedure adds additional terms to the equations , which can be tuned so that the divergent parts of the response disappear . in other words ,",
    "these two quantities are used as collective variables which , together with the outgoing radiation fields , are expected to describe the main features of the asymptotic dynamics if the initial perturbation is sufficiently small .",

    "moreover , if @xmath102 , so that @xmath100 is inside the phonon band of the homogeneous equation , a resonance will generally occur , resulting in radiation with frequency @xmath103 emitted from the breather region . the strength of the radiation field is determined by the ( generally nonzero ) overlap between the @xmath101-part of ( [ 2nd2 ] ) and the corresponding homogeneous solution ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : higher - order ] ) . in a similar way",
    ", we obtain that the right - hand - side of the third order equation ( [ 3rd ] ) contains the frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath104 , the fourth order equation ( [ 4th ] ) contains the frequencies 0 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , and in general the _",

    "accordingly , we conclude that if @xmath108 so that @xmath107 belongs to the phonon band , the perturbed breather will radiate to _",

    "the consequences of this radiation for the breather itself will be discussed in secs .",
    "[ sec : internal ] and [ sec : phonons ] for the cases of localized and extended perturbations @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "with the initial perturbation @xmath77 of the single - site breather corresponding to a spatially localized eigenmode of the linearized equations ( [ 1st ] ) , it is clear from the discussion in sec .",
    "[ subsec : strategy ] that higher order radiation always will be created , since for any internal mode frequency @xmath38 there is always an integer @xmath94 such that @xmath107 belongs to the phonon band and ( [ pradiation ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "moreover , from the numerical results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we find that the spatially symmetric breathing mode always radiates to second order , since ( [ pradiation ] ) always is fulfilled for @xmath110 , while the antisymmetric pinning mode radiates to second order only when @xmath111 .",
    "thus , due to this radiation from the breather the total norm contained in any finite region around the breather(i.e . , the total norm of breather + internal mode ) will always decrease with time .",
    "however , the main concern here is the long - time effect of the internal - mode excitation on the breather itself , and thus we must investigate whether there will also be some transfer of energy between the breather and its internal mode . we will first ( sec . [",

[ fig2 ] ( c ) , where we have plotted the difference between the instantaneous breather frequency calculated at time @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and the frequency of the unperturbed breather @xmath119 . from this figure",
    ", we can also conclude that there are two different mechanisms causing the shift of breather frequency .",
    "firstly , there is an initial ( almost instantaneous ) rather large frequency shift , which can be interpreted as an adaption of the initially perturbed breather to the breather which is closest to the initial condition . as is shown below in sec .",
    "[ subsec : higher - order ] , this time - independent frequency shift , which is observed to be always positive for the breathing mode , is a consequence of the overlap between the static part of the right - hand side of the second - order equation ( [ 2nd2 ] ) and the zero - frequency modes . secondly , there is the slow , continuous increase of the breather frequency which corresponds to the slow increase of @xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) , indicating a continuous transfer of norm from the internal mode to the breather .",
    "it is described by the static part of the right - hand side of the fourth - order equation ( [ 4th ] ) ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : higher - order ] ) .",
    "when the initial perturbation of the breather is taken in the direction of its internal pinning mode we observe , just as for the breathing mode , that the breather - internal mode interaction asymptotically _ always leads to breather growth_. an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where the parameter values have been chosen so that the lowest harmonic that enters the phonon band is @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , we observe two qualitative differences compared to the case with breathing mode excitation .",
    "firstly , since in this case the first phonon resonance occurs only in the third order equation ( [ 3rd ] ) , the decay of the internal mode amplitude will be slower , and a good fit is obtained by @xmath123 .",
    "this agrees with the general result when @xmath124 is the lowest harmonic that enters the phonon band obtained for the continuum generalized nls equation in ref .",

    ", the breather growth will also be slower when @xmath125 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) by comparing the time - scales with those of fig .",
    "secondly , the initial shift of the breather frequency for a pinning mode excitation is always much smaller than for the breathing mode excitation ( also when @xmath100 is in the phonon band ) , and is when @xmath126 also observed to be negative .",
    "the explanation for this is given in sec .",
    "[ subsec : higher - order ] .",
    "however , it is important to stress that also in the cases where the initial frequency shift is negative , we find that the continuous breather growth always will give an asymptotic frequency shift which is positive .      here , we will analyze the higher - order equations ( [ 2nd])-([4th ] ) by making use of the strategy of systematically removing the appearing divergent parts as outlined in sec .",
    "[ subsec : strategy ] ( in analogy with the treatment of the continuous nls - type equations in e.g. refs .",
    "first , we show how the dominating contribution to the time - independent frequency shift observed in the numerical simulations above can be calculated from the static part of the right - hand side of the second - order equation ( [ 2nd ] ) .",
    "this frequency shift can be explicitly taken into account by replacing @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ perturbation ] ) with @xmath127 , where @xmath119 is the unperturbed breather frequency and @xmath128 the second - order shift to be determined .",

    "writing the response to the static part of ( [ 2nd2 ] ) as @xmath130 with real @xmath131 and @xmath132 then yields @xmath133 with @xmath46 as defined by eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "if the expansion of the right - hand side of ( [ mstatic ] ) in the complete set of vectors consisting of the eigenvectors of @xmath46 ( including the phase mode ) and the growth mode contains some component on either of the two zero - frequency modes , the response @xmath134 will not remain bounded but diverge linearly with time .",
    "thus , in order to remove this divergency , the frequency shift @xmath128 must be chosen so that both these components are identically zero .",
    "the component on the growth mode is trivially zero , while the component on the phase mode is obtained by applying the pseudo - scalar product ( [ scalar ] ) with the vector corresponding to the growth mode and using ( [ overlap ] ) .",
    "demanding this component to be zero yields @xmath135 this is typically positive for the breathing mode , since the dominating contribution to the sum in ( [ static ] ) comes from the central site @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is always positive . for the spatially antisymmetric pinning mode , there is no contribution to this sum from the central site , since @xmath138 and @xmath139 are zero . the change from a positive to a negative frequency shift when increasing @xmath17 in this case is related to a qualitative change of the nature of the growth mode @xmath140 : for @xmath141 we find that @xmath142 for all @xmath143 , so that all terms in the sum in eq .",

    "then , the non - static part of the right - hand side of the second order equation ( [ 2nd2 ] ) will generally give rise to a non - localized response , which can be written in the form @xmath146 .",
    "this response corresponds to the radiation field going out from the breather region , and since the right - hand side of ( [ 2nd2 ] ) is spatially localized and symmetric , this field should asymptotically correspond to two identical linear waves propagating to the left ( right ) for @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) .",

    "furthermore , we always have @xmath233 , so that the regime of higher - order radiation generation is a subset of the regime @xmath234 where modulational instability for _ travelling _ plane waves occurs @xcite .",

    "a typical example of the long - time evolution of a breather interacting with a small - amplitude standing - wave phonon with @xmath235 is illustrated by fig .",

    "this process is similar to the one observed for the two - channel phonon scattering on breathers in a klein - gordon model with a morse potential in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however in the latter case the second outgoing wave resulted from a resonance in the linearized equations and were therefore of the same order of magnitude as the incoming wave , and moreover the outcome in this case was breather decay since the energy of a klein - gordon breather is an increasing function of its amplitude .",

    "another possible interpretation is that the increase of the oscillation amplitude is connected with the oscillatory instabilities of the standing waves ; as we will show in the next section these instabilities provide a mechanism for breather decay . however in some cases , illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , the oscillation amplitude as well as its average value apparently approaches a constant limit value .",

    "in this section , with the aim at describing the interaction between a breather and a standing - wave phonon with non - negligible amplitude , we will take a slightly different point of view than in the preceding sections . instead of choosing as initial condition an exact breather solution and adding a perturbation corresponding to an eigenmode of the linearized equations",

    "the instability scenario for the standing - wave phonons is basically the same as for the isolated defect , with the essential difference that the localized pinning modes associated with the individual , periodically repeated defects now will form a continuous defect band. in general , the krein signature @xcite of this defect band is opposite to that of the bands associated with the non - zero amplitude sites @xcite ( for @xmath234 there are generally several defect bands , but they will have the same krein signature ) , and as a consequence resonances between the bands will occur if the linear coupling @xmath246 is large enough , giving rise to similar oscillatory instabilities as described above ( details are given in @xcite ) .",

    "the final state appears also here to be a chaotic phonobreather ; we have followed the time evolution of this kind of state for times up to @xmath283 without seeing any signs of decay .",
    "also , if the initial breather frequency is chosen above the critical value @xmath281 , we typically do not observe breather growth ; instead the mean value of the chaotic amplitude oscillations resulting from the oscillatory instability remains close to the initial amplitude .",
    "investigating the interaction between discrete nonlinear schrdinger breathers and small perturbations , we have found firstly that exciting an internal mode of the breather always leads to a slow energy transfer to the breather , i.e. , to breather growth . furthermore , we found that a dnls - breather can pump energy from a small - amplitude standing - wave phonon , provided that the phonon wave vector is smaller than the critical value @xmath226 given by eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) . in both cases",
    ", the mechanism for breather growth involves the higher - order generation of radiating modes .",
    "since this mechanism disappears at the threshold value @xmath281 of the breather frequency , it is impossible for a breather to grow beyond this value with the type of small - amplitude perturbations considered here . to analyze the interaction between breathers and standing - wave phonons of small but non - negligible amplitude , we considered the long - time evolution of weakly perturbed exact phonobreather solutions .",
    "the instabilities of these , originating in oscillatory instabilities of the nonlinear phonons , where shown to lead to propagating inhomogeneities whose interaction with the breather provided a mechanism for breather decay and destruction ( when the phonon wave vector @xmath262 ) or growth ( @xmath284 and @xmath285 ) .    as was mentioned already in the introduction , the existence of the two conserved quantities ( [ dnlsham ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) makes the dnls equation non - generic among nonlinear lattice equations , and it is therefore necessary to investigate to what extent the results obtained in this paper apply also for klein - gordon and fpu lattices .",
    "we plan to address these questions in a forthcoming publication , but let us stress already here that the perturbational approach used here for the dnls equation needs to be modified to account for the fact that generically , the dynamics of the breather involves also higher harmonics of its fundamental frequency . moreover , the approach used in secs .",
    "[ subsec : conservation ] and [ sec : phonons ] based on the conservation laws can not be directly applied in the absence of a second conserved quantity . however , in view of the wide applicability of the dnls equation ( and in particular its appearance as a limit case of general lattice equations as mentioned in the introduction ) , we believe that the mechanisms for breather growth and destruction described in this paper are essential ingredients also for the corresponding processes in general lattice models .",
