    "last years showed much progress in the experimental determination of the @xmath0-factors of hydrogen - like ions @xcite .",
    "measurements , accurate up to a few parts in @xmath1 @xcite , were performed by studying a single ion confined in a penning trap .",
    "these experiments provided the stringent tests of bound - state quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory and yielded the best determination of the electron mass @xcite .    in order to match the experimental accuracy ,",
    "many sophisticated calculations were performed during the past years , in particular those of the one - loop self - energy @xcite , the one - loop vacuum - polarization @xcite , the nuclear recoil @xcite , and the two - loop qed effects @xcite .",
    "these calculations made it possible to determine the electron mass from the experimental values of the bound - electron @xmath0 factor @xcite .",
    "the theoretical accuracy of the bound - electron @xmath0 factor in hydrogen - like ions is presently at the @xmath2 level @xcite for light elements up to carbon but deteriorates quickly for heavier elements because of the unknown higher - order two - loop qed effects scaling with the nuclear charge number @xmath3 as @xmath4 .",
    "the experimental investigations of the @xmath0-factors of hydrogen - like ions were so far performed for ions with spinless nuclei . however , when applied to the ions with a non - zero nuclear spin , such investigations can be useful as a new method for the determination of the magnetic dipole moments of the nuclei .",
    "this method has important advantages over the more traditional approaches , such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , atomic beam magnetic resonance , collinear laser spectroscopy , and optical pumping ( op ) .",
    "these advantages are that ( i ) the simplicity of the system under investigation ( a hydrogen - like ion ) allows for an _ ab initio _ theoretical description with a reliable estimation of uncalculated effects and ( ii ) the influence of the nuclear - structure effects ( which are the main limiting factors for theory ) is relatively weak .",
    "this is in contrast to the existing methods , in which the experimental data should be corrected for several physical effects , which are difficult to calculate . among such effects is the diamagnetic shielding of the external magnetic field by the electrons in the atom .",
    "the nmr results should be also corrected for the paramagnetic chemical shift caused by the chemical environment @xcite and the op data are sensitive to the hyperfine mixing of the energy levels @xcite .",
    "significant ( and generally unknown ) uncertainties of calculations of these effects often lead to ambiguities in the published values of nuclear magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present investigation is to perform an _ ab initio _ calculation of the @xmath0-factor of a hydrogen - like ion with a non - zero nuclear spin .",
    "it can be demonstrated that the nuclear - spin dependent part of the atomic @xmath0-factor can be parameterized in terms of the nuclear magnetic shielding constant @xmath5 , which describes the effective reduction of the coupling of the nuclear magnetic moment @xmath6 to an external magnetic field @xmath7 caused by the shell electron(s ) , @xmath8    the relativistic theory of the @xmath0-factor of a hydrogen - like ion with a non - zero nuclear spin ( and , thus , the theory of the nuclear magnetic shielding ) was examined in detail in ref .",

    "we go beyond the relativistic description of the nuclear magnetic shielding and calculate the dominant corrections to it , namely , the self - energy , the vacuum - polarization , and the nuclear magnetization distribution corrections . as a result",
    ", we bring the theory to the point where the uncertainty due to nuclear - structure effects impedes further progress .",
    "the main challenge of the present work is the calculation of the self - energy correction . to the best of our knowledge , the only previous attempt to address it was made in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "the self - energy contribution to the shielding constant was estimated by the leading logarithm of its @xmath9 expansion ( where @xmath10 is the fine - structure constant ) . in our work",
    ", we calculate the self - energy correction rigorously to all orders in the binding nuclear strength parameter @xmath9 and , independently , perform an analytical calculation to the leading order in the expansion in this parameter ( including both the logarithm and constant terms ) .",
