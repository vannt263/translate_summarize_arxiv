    "reflection of hard x - ray emission from a `` corona '' onto the accretion disk can measure black hole spin , and can also serve as a powerful probe of the geometry of black hole accretion flows .",
    "disk reflection spectra excited near to black holes will bear the imprints of gravitational red - shifts and strong doppler shifts ( e.g. fabian et al .  1989 ) . as long as the accretion disk extends to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ;",
    "bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ) , the degree of the distortions imposed by these shifts can be used to infer the spin of the black hole ; efforts to exploit disk reflection as a spin diagnostic in x - ray binaries began in earnest over a decade ago . owing to the fact that the effects on fe k emission lines are",
    "especially pronounced features , and owing to the high flux levels observed in galactic x - ray binaries , spin measurements have been made in a number of systems using this technique ( e.g. miller 2007 ; miller et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in cases where the disk extends to the isco and the continuum",
    "is known to be fairly simple , not only can spin be inferred , the geometry of the corona can also be discerned .",
    "the best spectra and variability studies appear to point toward a very compact central corona ( @xmath31020   @xmath4 ; e.g. reis & miller 2013 ) , consistent with prior results suggesting that hard x - ray emission may arise in the base of a relativistic jet ( e.g. fender et al .",
    "1999 ; markoff , nowak , & wilms 2005 ; miller et al .",
    "however , this is not yet clear , and it also unclear that this geometry holds universally .    extremely high sensitivity  especially over a broad spectral band  provides a path forward in situations where the continuum and reflection spectrum may be more difficult to parse .",
    "_ nustar _ detectors have a triggered read - out ; unlike ccd spectrometers , they are not subject to pile - up distortions ( harrison et al .",
    "2013 ) . in this respect ,",
    "_ nustar _ is especially well - suited to disk reflection studies of bright galactic compact objects .",
    "moreover , _ nustar _ offers unprecedented sensitivity out to almost 80  kev , giving an excellent view of the compton back - scattering hump ( typically peaking in the 2030  kev ) , and any additional curvature or breaks .",
    "grs 1915@xmath0105 is a particularly important source for understanding black hole spin , disk  jet connections in all accreting systems , and how accretion flows evolve with the mass accretion rate .",
    "prior efforts to measure the spin of grs 1915@xmath0105 have not come to a clear consensus .",
    "moreover , a multiplicity of states are observed in grs 1915@xmath0105 ( belloni et al .",
    "the most intriguing of these may be the so - called `` plateau '' state , because it bears the closest analogy with the `` low / hard '' state in other black hole transients .",
    "notably , radio emission consistent with compact jet production and strong low ",
    "frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are observed in this state ( e.g. muno et al .",
    "2001 ) ; when combined with sensitive spectroscopy , these features may offer unique insights into the inner accretion flow .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the _ nustar _ observation of grs 1915@xmath0105 and our reduction of the data .",
    "section 3 describes our analysis of the fpma and fpmb specta . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the results of our spectral fits and their impacts .",
    "_ nustar _ observed grs 1915@xmath0105 on 03 july 2012 , over a span of 59.8  ks .",
    "the data were screened and processed using nustardas version 1.1.1 .",
    "spectra from the fpma and fpmb detectors were extracted from 90  regions centered on the source position .",
    "background spectra were extracted from regions of equivalent size on each detector ; however , the background is negligible .",
    "response files appropriate for the pointing ( on - axis ) , source type ( point , not extended ) and region size were automatically created by the nustardas software . after all efficiencies and screening , the net exposure time for the resultant spectra was 14.7  ks for the fpma , and 15.2  ksec for the fpmb .",
    "the net observing time is small compared to the total observing due to the source flux , and in part because the observation occurred very early in the mission , and in part owing to detector dead - time .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using xspec version 12.6 ( arnaud & dorman 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath5 statistic was used to assess the relative quality of different spectral models .",
    "we used `` churazov '' weighting for all fits to govern the influence of bins with progressively less signal at high energy ( churazov et al .",
    "all errors reported in this work reflect the @xmath2 confidence interval on a given parameter .",
    "examination of the _ swift_/bat light curve of grs  1915@xmath0105 shows that our observation was made at the start of an @xmath6100-day interval with sustained hard flux and only moderate variability .",
    "intervals before and after have much stronger day - to - day variability .",
    "the lightcurve of our observation shows significant source variability on short time scales , typical of grs 1915@xmath0105 , as well as moderately strong qpos between 0.53.0  hz .",
    "a full timing analysis will be reported in a separate paper ( bachetti et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) , but the fact of these variability properties helps us to make a secure identification of the source state . these timing properties , as well as the source flux observed by the _",
    "swift_/bat , are typical of the `` plateau '' state of grs 1915@xmath0105 ( e.g. , muno et al .",
    "2001 , trudolyubov 2001 , fender & belloni 2004 ) .",
    "observations with the ratan-600 radio telescope found that grs 1915@xmath0105 varied between @xmath7 and @xmath8 mjy at 4.8 ghz ( trushkin , private communication ) during the _ nustar _ observation , consistent with relatively radio  faint `` plateau '' states .    version 1.1.1 of the nustardas software and calibration has verified the detector response over the 379  kev band , partly through careful comparisons to the crab . in all cases ,",
    "the fpma and fpmb spectra of grs 1915@xmath0105 were jointly fit over the 379  kev band .",
    "an overall constant was allowed to float between the detectors to account for any mismatch in their absolute flux calibration ; in all cases , the value of this constant was found to be 1.02 or less . in all fits ,",
    "absorption in the ism was fit using the `` tbabs '' model ( wilms , allen , & mccray 2000 ) , using corresponding abundances ( `` wilm '' ) and cross sections ( `` vern '' ; verner et al .  1996 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the fpma and fpmb spectra of grs 1915@xmath0105 , fit with a basic power - law model .",
    "the sensitivity of both spectra is excellent .",
    "simple , broken , and cut - off power - law models all fail to fit the data .",
    "however , they approximate the continuum , and the prominence of the remaining disk reflection features in the spectra is readily discerned in the ratio plots in figure 2 .",
    "the power - law indices obtained in these simple fits are broadly consistent with values measured in fits to _ suzaku _ spectra of grs 1915@xmath0105 in the `` plateau '' state ( blum et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the `` comptt '' model describes thermal comptonization ( titarchuk 1994 ) .",
    "it also leaves strong reflection - like residuals , and does not provide an acceptable fit .",
    "the `` nthcomp '' model is essentially a more physical means of obtaining a cut - off power - law continuum by mixing thermal and non - thermal electron distributions ( zycki , done , & smith 1999 ) .",
    "importantly , `` nthcomp '' is capable of accounting for curvature that might otherwise be mistaken for disk reflection .",
    "however , the data / model ratio and fit statistic in figure 2 show that even `` nthcomp '' is unable to account for the strong , broad fe k line and the compton back - scattering hump .",
    "the `` eqpair '' model describes compton scattering in a sophisticated way , allowing mixtures of thermal and non - thermal electron distributions ( coppi 1999 ) .",
    "`` eqpair '' also explicitly includes blurred disk reflection .",
    "however , the reflection spectrum ( described via the `` pexriv '' model , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) is blurred with the `` rdblur '' function ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) , which only describes the schwarzschild metric and does not permit spin measurements .",
    "the internal reflection was coupled to an external `` diskline '' model , which is the kernel of `` rdblur '' , in order to account for the emission line . in our fits , we fixed the cosine of the inclination angle to 0.3 , the elemental abundances to solar values , the inner disk radius to minimum possible @xmath9 , the outer radius to @xmath10 , the emissivity to the euclidian value of @xmath11 ( recall that @xmath12 ) and the disk temperature to @xmath13  k ( the maximum allowed ) .",
    "the reflection fraction and disk ionization were allowed to vary .",
    "numerous parameters control the hybrid thermal and non - thermal continuum . for simplicity , we fixed the disk blackbody temperature from which photons are up - scattered to @xmath14  kev , and varied the soft photon compactness ( @xmath15 ) , the ratio of the hard to soft compactness ( @xmath16 ) , the fraction of the power supplied to energetic particles that goes into accelerating non - thermal particles ( @xmath17 ) , and the thomson scattering depth ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the radius of the scattering region could not be constrained and was fixed at @xmath19 .",
    "default values were assumed for all other parameters .",
    "fitting `` eqpair '' in this way , a large improvement is achieved ( @xmath20 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "given these results , models focused on ionized disk reflection were next pursued .",
    "our best - fit spectral model is @xmath21 ( see table 1 , and figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "`` kerrconv '' is a relativistic blurring function , based on ray - tracing simulations ( brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) .",
    "it includes inner and outer disk emissivity indices ( following wilkins & fabian 2012 , @xmath22 floated freely but @xmath23 was required ) , an emissivity break radius , the black hole spin parameter , the inner disk inclination ( bounded between @xmath24 , based on jet studies by fender et al .",
    "1999 ) , and inner and outer disk radii ( in units of the isco radius ; values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 were frozen in all fits ) .",
    "`` reflionx_hc '' is a new version of the well - known `` reflionx '' model that describes reflection from an ionized accretion disk of constant density ( ross & fabian 2005 ) , assuming an incident power - law with a cut - off .",
    "these models capture important effects by solving the ionization balance within the disk , and scatter - broadening photoelectric absorption edges .",
    "that is , `` reflionx_hc '' includes broadening due to scattering , and this effect is balanced against dynamical and gravitational broadening when the model is convolved with `` kerrconv '' .",
    "the power - law index of the hard emission in the `` reflionx_hc '' and `` cutoffpl '' models was linked in our fits , as was the characteristic exponential cut - off energy .",
    "the abundance of fe within `` reflionx_hc '' was allowed to vary in the @xmath27 range , and the ionization parameter was allowed to float freely ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "flux normalizations for the `` reflionx_hc '' and `` cutoffpl '' models were also measured .    as shown in table 1",
    ", the best blurred reflection model gives a fit statistic of @xmath29 .",
    "this model returns a precise spin measurement : @xmath30 .",
    "the quoted error is only the statistical error .",
    "systematic errors are likely much larger , and related to the assumption that the optically  thick disk truncates at the isco ( see , e.g. , shafee et al .  2008 ; reynolds & fabian 2008 ; noble , krolik , & hawley 2010 ) , and different methods and physics captured in different spectral models .    to obtain a broader view of the spin measurment and its uncertainty",
    ", we scanned the @xmath31 range using the `` steppar '' command in xspec .",
    "we made an initial scan with 100 points across the full band , and a second scan with 50 points in the @xmath32 range .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of this error scan .",
    "there is a clear minimum at @xmath33 ; a maximal spin of @xmath34 is rejected at very high confidence , and so too are low spin values .",
    "it is notable that the @xmath5 versus @xmath35 contour shows local fluctuations , especially between @xmath36 , although all @xmath5 values are significantly higher than achieved for the best - fit spin of @xmath37 .",
    "the fluctuations may indicate deficiencies in the spectral model , or could be partly due to the limited energy resolution of the spectra .",
    "we also explored a number of fits with key parameters fixed at particular values ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the data clearly prefer a solar abundance of fe , and the very steep inner emissivity index , for instance .",
    "the data strongly exclude a model with a much higher cut - off energy . as also indicated in figure 4 , the data rule out reflection from a black hole with zero spin at very high confidence ( the model considered in table 1 fixes @xmath38 and the emissitivity indices at @xmath39 , appropriate for a `` lamp post '' model in a schwarzschild regime ) .",
    "importantly , a plausible model for the low / hard state is also ruled out . the `` truncated '' model in table 1 changed the best - fit model to require an inner disk radius fixed at 20 times the isco , and @xmath39 .",
    "we also fit the `` eqpair '' model again , fixing @xmath40 ; this returned @xmath41 , potentially indicating the importance of spin effects .    the best ",
    "fit model in table 1 gives a flux of @xmath42 ( 0.1100  kev ) . adopting the mass and distance values favored by steeghs et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44  kpc , this flux gives a luminosity of @xmath45 ( where the error is based on an assumed distance uncertainty of @xmath46  kpc ) , or an eddington fraction of @xmath47 .",
    "we have fit numerous models to an early broad - band _ nustar _ spectrum of grs 1915@xmath0105 , obtained in a `` plateau '' state .",
    "the sensitivity of the spectrum is extraordinary , in that the effects of continuum curvature and disk reflection can clealy be distinguished .",
    "models that predict continuum curvature but which do not include reflection are unable to provide satisfactory fits .",
    "the data require a continuum with an exponential cut - off , and reflection from an ionized accretion disk around a black hole with a spin of @xmath37 .",
    "evidence of a relativistic disk line in grs 1915@xmath0105 was first detected with bepposax ( martocchia et al .",
    "fits to the line detected in archival asca spectra recorded a steep emissivity and small inner radius ( @xmath48 ) commensurate with a spin approaching @xmath49 ( miller et al .",
    "2005 ; similar values were subsequently found by mcclintock et al .",
    "2006 and middleton et al .",
    "2006 using the disk continuum ) . two observations with xmm - newton also detected broad lines but were inconclusive with respect to spin ( martocchia et al .",
    "2006 ) , as was a deep spectrum of grs 1915@xmath0105 in the `` plateau '' obtained with _",
    "( blum et al .  2009 ) .",
    "the measurement of a high spin parameter in a source known for jet production is interesting in that it may indicate that spin powers jet production , as predicted by e.g. blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) .",
    "it is _ possible _ that the jet is powered partly by tapping the spin ( miller et al .",
    "2009 ; fender , gallo , & russell 2010 ; narayan & mcclintock 2012 , steiner , mcclintock , & narayan 2013 ; russell , fender , & gallo 2013 ) .",
    "however , the broadest survey of available data suggests that the mass accretion rate and/or magnetic field may act as a kind of `` throttle '' ( king et al .  2013a , 2013b ) and do more to affect jet power .",
    "the spectral fits presented in this paper also offer some potential insights into the geometry of the inner accretion flow , and into jet production . compared to an euclidean emissivity of @xmath39 ,",
    "the inner emissivity index is extremely steep ( @xmath50 , see table 1 ) .",
    "this may ultimately be unphysical or incorrect ; however , the same spin is obtained when @xmath51 is fixed ( see table 1 ) .",
    "our results appear to broadly confirm the predictions of independent ray - tracing studies that find steep and broken emissivity profiles for compact , on - axis , hard x - ray sources emitting close to rapidly  spinning black holes ( wilkins & fabian 2011 , 2012 ; dauser et al .",
    "the emissivity is also predicted to flatten at moderate radii , again consistent with our results .",
    "given that grs 1915@xmath0105 launches compact radio jets in the `` plateau '' state ( e.g. muno et al .",
    "2001 ; trudolyubov 2001 ; fender & belloni 2004 ) , the hard x - ray region may plausibly associated with the base of the jet .",
    "a very steep inner emissivity profile was recently reported in fits to the _ suzaku _ spectrum of cygnus x-1 in the `` low / hard '' state ( fabian et al .",
    "suzaku _ and radio monitoring of cygnus x-1 in the `` low / hard '' state also concluded that the hard x - ray continuum is likely produced in the base of the relativistic jet ( miller et al .",
    "more broadly , similar emissivity profiles have been seen in massive black holes acceting at relatively high eddington fractions , notably 1h 0707@xmath52495 ( fabian et al .",
    "studies of time lags in seyferts and microlensing in quasars suggest that very compact coronae may be common ( reis & miller 2013 ) .    advection  dominated accretion flow models predict that the inner disk should be truncated at @xmath53 , or @xmath54 ( assuming an efficiency of 10% ; esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ) .",
    "this is broadly consistent with the luminosity at which many sources transition into the `` low / hard '' state , wherein jet production is ubiquitous .",
    "our results indicate that a steady jet can potentially be launched from a disk that extends to the isco .",
    "the disk , corona , and jet are undoubtedly a complex , coupled system , but jet production in black holes may be more closely tied to the nature of the corona than the inner disk radius .",
    "this may support a new model for jets and qpos in accreting black holes ( mckinney , tchekhovskoy , & blandford 2012 ) .",
    "this _ nustar _ observation has offered new insights into nature of the accretion flow in the `` plateau '' state , owing to its extraordinary sensitivity .",
    "similarly , it has also provided the first strong spin constraint based on disk reflection modeling .",
    "however , additional modeling using developing disk reflection codes , and a deeper observation in the `` plateau '' state , are likely required in order to confirm these initial model ",
    "dependent results . a _ nustar _",
    "observation in a softer , more luminous state is likely also required in order to rigidly test and verify the spin measurement .",
