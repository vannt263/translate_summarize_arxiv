    "a constraint on the number density of compact objects have been obtained . for a fixed value of the mass @xmath113 of each compact object",
    ", the constraint can be translated into a constraint on @xmath114 , where @xmath114 is the average energy density of compact objects in the unit of the critical density @xmath115 .",

    "hence we do not distinguish between the point mass lenses and ellis wormholes .",
    "another possible observation to probe ellis wormholes is the observation of gravitational waves from compact object binaries .",
    "the unlensed wave form of the gravitational waves from a compact object binary is well known . from the chirp signal in the inspiral phase ,",
    "we can obtain the spectrum of the gravitational waves . in order to distinguish the ellis wormhole from a point mass lens",
    ", we need to observe not only the typical interference pattern but also the wave effect in the lensed spectrum .",
    "hence , the spectrum in @xmath126 is necessary to probe the ellis wormhole . assuming @xmath127 , the typical throat radius of ellis wormholes which can be probed by using gravitational waves",
    "is estimated as follows : @xmath128    the same estimate is applicable for galactic sources of electro - magnetic waves .",
    "we obtain @xmath129 for galactic radio sources with @xmath130 , @xmath131 m for galactic optical or infra - red sources and @xmath131 cm for galactic x - ray sources .",
    "the source must be compact enough to show the clear oscillation behaviour in the spectrum .",
    "this fact can be clearly understood by considering the @xmath94 dependence of the phase in the amplification factor . since @xmath91 is roughly approximated by @xmath100 , the period @xmath132 for one cycle",
    "is given by @xmath133 .",
    "the corresponding length scale @xmath134 on the source plane is given by @xmath135 where we have assumed @xmath136 .",
    "if the source radius is larger than @xmath134 , the interference pattern will be smeared out .",
    "observation of compact galactic sources such as pulsars and white dwarfs might be useful to probe not only dark compact objects but also exotic compact objects such as the ellis wormhole .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed the probe of ellis wormholes by using spectroscopic observations .",
    "we have assumed that the spectrum of the target source can be measured in enough accuracy and the spectrum shape is well known without lensing , but the luminosity is not necessarily observable .",
    "then , we have discussed the distinguishability of the lensed spectrum from the case of the point mass lens .",
    "we have derived the wave form after the scattering by the ellis wormhole including the wave effect in the low frequency domain .",
    "the geometrical optics limit of the wave form has been also analytically derived .",
    "then , we have found that the ellis wormhole can not be distinguished from the point mass lens by using only the high frequency domain in which the geometrical optics approximation is valid .",
    "we have also found that this degeneracy is resolved in the low frequency domain in which the wave effect is significant .",
    "possible observational constraints are also discussed and we estimated the upper bound for the number density of ellis wormholes as @xmath125 with throat radius @xmath124 from the existing femto - lensing analysis for compact objects .    finally , we note that our method to probe the ellis wormhole is complementary to the other methods to probe the ellis wormhole with micro - lensing @xcite or the astrometric image centroid displacements@xcite . these are not feasible for observations on cosmological scales because the time scale of the lens event is too long to detect modulation of the light curve or the displacements .",
    "in contrast , the slow relative motion is an advantage for spectroscopic observations .",
