    "neutral hydrogen constitutes a significant component of the interstellar medium of disk galaxies .",
    "the study of its abundance and kinematics , as measured by the 21 cm emission line , has seen applications to a variety of astrophysical problems , ranging from studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies to secular evolution in clusters .",
    "hi line emission carries information about the distribution of neutral gas , and through tracing of its velocity field , of the total mass in a galaxy . even in the absence of any spatial information about the distribution of the gas , the global hi line profile , contained within the beam of a single dish telescope or integrated over the entire hi distribution where resolved , provides three key indicators : ( 1 ) the observed redshift of the system as a whole ; ( 2 ) the observed hi line flux , which , in the optically thin case , can be related to the hi mass ; and ( 3 ) the observed hi line full width , which , when corrected to face - on viewing , is related to the total rotational velocity of the hi gas .",
    "these quantities have been used for diverse applications such as the tracing of large scale structure by gas - rich systems , the comparative hi content of galaxies in differing environments and the derivation of secondary distances using the tully - fisher method ( tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "hi line systemic velocities , fluxes and characteristic velocity widths have been recorded for more than 20,000 galaxies and presented in large published compilations such as that of huchtmeier & richter ( 1991 ) and the _ third reference catalog of bright galaxies _ ( rc3 , de vaucouleurs _",
    "et al . _",
    "1991 ) . until recently",
    ", the vast majority of extragalactic hi line spectral parameters were associated with observational targets selected from optical catalogs .",
    "only recently have large - area hi blind surveys been undertaken , notably the arecibo hi strip survey ( ahiss ; zwaan _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , the arecibo dual beam survey ( adbs ; rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) , the hi jodrell all - sky survey ( hijass ; lang _ et al .",

    "@xmath2 identified purely on the peak flux of their hi line emission profiles .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , extremely few systems detected in the hi blind surveys have no optical counterpart ( kilborn _ et al . _  2000",
    "; rosenberg & schneider 2002 ) , but understanding the difference between optical and hi  selected samples is critical to determining the true census of gas - bearing objects in the nearby universe and the relationship of present day disks to the damped lyman @xmath3 absorbers seen in qso spectra .    with the exception of the hipass dataset which has been processed uniformly and can be accessed digitally through a public website ( http://hipass.aus-vo.org/ ) , a significant disadvantage of past compilations arises from heterogenous processing and parameter extraction algorithms , as well as the lack of availability of the digital spectra themselves . in many cases , error or noise estimates are lacking and corrections for instrumental effects",
    "not applied or derivable .",
    "because of our own on - going work related to the applications of hi spectral data in correlative and secondary studies , we have developed and maintained a digital archive of hi line spectra for some 9000 optically  selected galaxies observed by us and our numerous collaborators using various telescopes over the last 20@xmath4 years .",
    "two of the telescopes used , the 91  m and 42  m telescopes of the national radio astronomy observatory at green bank , are no longer operational ( in fact , the 91  m telescope no longer exists ) .",
    "while hi parameters for most of these datasets have been presented previously , changing scientific objectives and computer capabilities have led to advances in the robustness of parameter extraction algorithms . in order to establish a well - characterized and permanent digital archive of these global hi profiles ,",
    "we have reanalyzed the global hi line profiles using a single set of processing and parameter estimation algorithms . in this paper , we present a homogeneous compilation of the extracted hi line parameters and provide quantitative corrections and error estimates .",
    "these data are being used in a variety of ongoing studies , including a robust estimation of the hi mass function ( springob , haynes , & giovanelli 2005 ) and studies of the local peculiar velocity field .    in section 2 , we review the observational circumstances of the archival dataset as well as present new hi observations undertaken with the arecibo 305 meter telescope .",
    "section 3 discusses the process of extracting useful parameters from the global hi line profiles and the corrections required to derive physically meaningful quantities .",
    "the archive is presented in section 4 , followed by discussion of the characteristics of the data set , its completeness and its limitations in section 5 .",
    "a brief summary concludes in section 6 .",
    "the majority of the hi line datasets included in the current compilation have been discussed in previous publications . here we review the general characteristics of the telescopes employed to conduct the observations , summarized in table 1 , and also present the results of new observations for a sample of 145 obtained with the upgraded arecibo telescope .",

    "the basic parameters of those telescopes are summarized in table 1 , along with a compilation of the principal references to the published works which include discussions of the individual observing programs , observational setups and target selection criteria .",
    "observations at arecibo employed several diffferent l  band feed systems , denoted by their designated names : one of the high gain dual circular polarization feeds ( `` dual circular '' ; two such similar feeds were available , one of which was remotely tunable in frequency ) and a low sidelobe linear polarization l - band feed ( `` flat '' feed ) . during the 1990 s ,",
    "the arecibo telescope was upgraded and a low noise , broadband secondary and tertiary reflector gregorian optical system was installed ; observations made with it are described in the following subsection .",
    "nearly all observations were conducted in total power mode , with a position switching technique used to remove instrumental baseline effects . at each telescope , calibration of the noise diodes was performed by conducting observations of continuum sources from the catalog of bridle _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1972 ) , and both the flux and velocity scales were further checked by observations of a sample of strong hi line emitting galaxies .",
    "typical on  source integration times were dictated by signal  to  noise requirements and varied from as little as 5 minutes at arecibo to as much as 2 hours with the 42  m and nanay telescopes .",
    "final spectra are the accumulated weighted averages of multiple on - off pairs .",
    "the main distinctions among the hi datasets arise from differences in the sensitivities achieved with the different telescopes , and differences in the resolution and bandwidth associated with the available spectral backends . in order both to permit the analysis of instrumental effects and to measure widths using the same algorithm ,",
    "the accumulated and calibrated final spectra were exported from the respective on  line data format into the standard analyz ",
    "galpac `` history file '' format developed by rg at the arecibo observatory and were thus available in digital form for reprocessing using the algorithms described below .",
    "all accumulated spectra have been re - smoothed and re - baselined using an interactive process that allows the user to select the degree of smoothing ( typically hanning , but sometimes also a 3 channel boxcar in order to improve signal - to - noise , as noted in table 3 ) , choose the baseline regions and order ( typically 3 ) , flag the boundaries for flux integration and examine the results before they are stored away in the permanent archive .",
    "all spectra presented here have been reprocessed using the same parameter extraction algorithms , producing new measurements which supercede those presented previously .",
    "in addition to the hi spectra already contained in the digital archive , new hi line observations were conducted with the arecibo 305 meter telescope and its gregorian optics system between september and november 2001 .",
    "116 galaxies were detected , and an additional 29 galaxies for which we have optical heliocentric velocities yielded upper limits .",
    "targets were selected from among inclined spirals included in our private database , referred to as the arecibo general catalog ( agc ) .",

    "the l - band narrow receiver was used in 9-level sampling mode for all observations , feeding each polarization to four correlator boards with 1024 channels and 25 mhz bandwidth ( yielding a velocity resolution of 5.15 km  s@xmath1 ) . in most ( but not all ) cases ,",
    "the redshift was not known in advance so that a search mode was employed , staggering the four boards to cover a total of 85 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the first board was centered at the 21 cm line rest frequency of 1420.40578 mhz , while the other three boards overlapped but with center frequencies offset at 20 , 40 , and 60 mhz below this frequency . on all nights ,",
    "the system temperature was approximately 30 k. all observations were conducted in a total power , position switching mode as a sequence of on  source and off - source pairs of 4 minutes each .",
    "the final spectrum is the average of the combination of the successive on - off pairs .",
    "the total number of on / off observations made for each galaxy varied based on the signal - to - noise ratio , and ranged from one to four . on the first three nights of observations , each board was doppler corrected to heliocentric velocity at the start of each on - off pair . beginning with the fourth night ,",
    "the same doppler correction was applied to each of the four boards , allowing the spacing between correlators to remain at 20 mhz exactly .",
    "beginning on the fifth night , we used the naic `` radar blanker '' , which detects the san juan airport s radar and suspends data - taking for brief intervals around the pulse arrival times , for all observations in which the redshift of the galaxy was either not known a priori or known to be such that the redshifted 1420 mhz hi line would overlap with the 1350 mhz frequency of the airport radar .    whereas data reduction for all other arecibo observations presented here was performed using the arecibo analyz - galpac analysis system , the data reduction for these new observations was carried out using the aips++ software package .",

    "1999 and references therein ) exactly , with one exception .",
    "we have used the ` setfreqmed ' and ` settimemed ' functions within the aips++ ` autoflag ' package to eliminate individual time - frequency pixels found to be corrupted by radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "the rfi identification algorithm flags pixels that deviate by more than 10 times the median deviation from a sliding median of width 10 pixels in both the time and frequency dimensions .",
    "the width of each pixel in the time domain is 1 second .",
    "the parameters extracted from global 21 cm line profiles obtained with single dish telescope require correction before physical quantities can be derived from them . here",
    "the process for conversion from observed to corrected parameters is described in some detail .",
    "modern radio telescopes can be continuum flux calibrated to a small fraction of their system noise , but as discussed by van zee _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1997 ) , the accuracy with which hi line fluxes can be measured is much less precise . beyond the continuum flux calibration which can be achieved at the better than 2% level , the accuracy with which line fluxes can be measured depends both on baseline stability and on corrections that must be applied to the observed values .",
    "the hi line fluxes @xmath10 presented here have been measured on the smoothed and baseline subtracted profiles by an interactive process in which the user marks the range of correlator channels over which the flux is measured by integrating the emission within these boundaries .",
    "the observed line flux @xmath11 must then be corrected for ( 1 ) beam attenuation , ( 2 ) pointing offsets , and ( 3 ) hi self absorption .",
    "we discuss each correction separately .",
    "since the hi distribution in a galaxy is often partially resolved by the telescope beam , the hi line flux detected by a given telescope underestimates the true flux by an amount that depends on how much the source hi distribution fills , or overfills , the beam .",
    "since the hi distribution is generally not known , an estimate of the beam attenuation correction is based on the adoption of a model hi distribution and an average telescope beam power pattern .",
    "the power patterns of the arecibo , 42  m , 91  m and 100  m telescopes are assumed to be gaussians with half power beam width ( hpbw ) as given in table 1 .",
    "for the nanay telescope , the beam width is assumed to be a two - dimensional gaussian with hpbw of 4  in the r.a .",
    "direction and 20  in the dec .",
    "the hi distribution is modeled as the sum of two gaussians , one of negative amplitude to produce a central hole ( shostak 1978 ; hewitt , haynes & giovanelli 1983 , hereafter hhg ) . following section iv of hhg",
    ", the hi surface brightness distribution @xmath12 is assumed to be characterized by the same axial ratio and to lie along the same position angle as the optical galaxy and is scaled such that @xmath13 , the diameter encompassing 70% of the hi mass , equals @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the optical major axis , in arcminutes , taken from either the uppsala general catalog ( nilson 1973 , hereafter ugc ) or the eso - uppsala survey of the eso(b ) atlas ( lauberts 1982 , hereafter eso ) , or estimated by us on the poss - i . following hhg ,",
    "the fraction @xmath16 of the source flux that is detected by the telescope beam is given by    @xmath17 } \\over { \\sum_{j=1,2 } a_j \\theta_j^2}}\\ ] ]    like hhg , we assume a double gaussian @xmath18 of amplitude @xmath19 and relative extent @xmath20 . note that @xmath21 above is not the hpbw but rather the beam extent at which the power pattern falls by @xmath22 , assuming a gaussian response .",
    "the inclination @xmath23 of the galaxy is derived from the observed optical axial ratio @xmath24 and an assumed intrinsic axial ratio that varies from 0.10 for the latest spirals to 0.23 for the earliest following section iv.e of haynes & giovanelli ( 1984 ; hg84 ) .",
    "the correction factor @xmath25 that accounts for beam attenuation is the inverse of this fraction , @xmath26 and approaches 1 when the hi distribution is significantly smaller than the telescope beam .",
    "because the hi extent of hi  normal spirals is significantly larger than their optical dimension , the application of this correction is very important for most hi observations conducted at arecibo with its relatively small hpbw ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "for example , face - on galaxies with optical sizes equal to about half the hpbw ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) have corrections of about @xmath29 ; a similar edge - on hi disk requires a correction half as large . for an object inclined by @xmath30 and an optical extent equal to the hpbw",
    ", the correction amounts to @xmath3160% . because the hi disk can normally be traced well beyond the optical extent ,",
    "the observed hi line flux in face - on systems as small as 0.8  require corrections of 5% or more .",
    "the other telescopes that have been employed have substantially wider beams , and there are few galaxies observed with them for which this correction is significant .    additionally , if the source hi distribution is not centered in the telescope beam , @xmath11 will be less than it would be in the absence of such pointing offset .",
    "departures from centering arise both from the intrinsic accuracy of a radio telescope to center on the input coordinates and from errors in the target coordinates relative to the true source position , and they are important only when such offsets subtend a substantial fraction of the beam extent . for older observations conducted with the arecibo line feeds ,",
    "the rms pointing accuracy of the telescope system was @xmath32   in both r.a . and",
    "dec . the precise amplitude of this error",
    "is not known but has been assumed to be random and of order 5% ( hg84 ) .",
    "therefore , all hi lines fluxes derived from spectra obtained at arecibo prior to 1993 have been multipled by a constant factor of @xmath33 to account for this systematic bias .",
    "this correction is not applied to other datasets .",
    "similarly , older datasets are also affected by the inaccuracy of the coordinates input to position the telesope on source at the time the observations were conducted . in such cases ,",
    "the flux is also underestimated by an amount which depends on the ratio of the angular displacement of the center of the telecope beam from the true source location to the beam extent and is important for some of the older arecibo line feed data . for spectra in our digital archive , a measure of the amount by which the flux has been underestimated because of coordinate inaccuracy",
    "can be calculated because the input coordinates are recorded in the digital spectra . to estimate this correction factor ,",
    "we have performed a set of numerical simulations mimicking observations offset from the arecibo line feed beam center , by convolving the beam power pattern with template galaxy hi distributions following the method developed in hhg .",
    "these simulations confirm that the measured flux in the simulations is relatively insensitive to the position angle of the galaxy ( assumed to follow the optical image ) , but quite sensitive to the angular displacement of the beam center from the center of the hi disk .",
    "following again hhg s result that @xmath34 , we relate the angular displacement @xmath35 of the targeted position from the true position and the optical apparent diameter @xmath15 to the flux correction @xmath36 , as shown in figure 1 . for each galaxy",
    "observed with the arecibo line feeds for which the pointing offset exceeds 0.1 , we adopt the flux correction associated with the closest match in both optical size and pointing offset shown in figure 1 .",
    "the figure illustrates the point that the required flux correction can be very large even for optically small galaxies , if the pointing offset is large .",
    "however , there are only 183 galaxies for which this correction boosts the flux by a factor of @xmath371.5 - 2.0 , and only 62 for which the flux correction is more than a factor of @xmath372 .",
    "lastly , optical depth effects also can result in a decrease of detected hi line flux if not all the photons escape .",
    "in the denser regions of disks , the interstellar medium can be optically thick at 21 cm ( braun 1997 ) , but the filling factor of opaque regions is small in the vast majority of disks . following giovanelli _",
    "_  ( 1994 ) and using the optical axial ratio as the measure of disk inclination , we correct for hi self - absorption by multiplying the measured hi line fluxes by the factor @xmath38 .",
    "this effect is small , with less than 30% of the hi line flux self absorbed in the most highly inclined systems .",
    "however , there are some galaxies for which this is the dominant correction . because this correction is model - dependent , and the interested reader may wish to apply a different self - absorption correction , we report the self - absorption corrected flux separately .    the two values we report for the corrected hi line flux are then @xmath39 , including the corrections for source extent and pointing , and @xmath40 , which also includes the correction for hi self - absorption .",
    "@xmath41 is , on average , 25% larger than the observed line flux .",
    "it should be noted that all of the corrections increase the value of line flux used in the calculation of hi masses .",
    "comparison of values presented here with others in the literature should take into account similar treatments in order to avoid systematic differences in the derived hi masses which might otherwise be interpreted as physical differences .",
    "several different sources of error affect the measurement of integrated hi line fluxes .",
    "the first is the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration commonly achieved by firing a noise diode at regular intervals ( van zee _",
    "et al . _",
    "1997 ) and understanding well the telescope gain and its variation .",
    "because modern telescope systems are significantly more stable than older ones , we follow van zee _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) in estimating that the uncertainty introduced by the noise diode calibration is 2% of the observed integrated flux for those observations made with the 42 m green bank telescope and for those made with the arecibo telescope after the installation of its gregorian optical system . for all other observations ,",
    "we estimate the uncertainty introduced by the noise diode calibration to be 10% of the observed integrated flux .",
    "further , we estimate that the uncertainty introduced by the correction coefficients is @xmath42 .    the integrated flux error contribution from _ statistical _ uncertainty has been discussed by both fouqe _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1990b ) and schneider _ et al . _  ( 1990 ) , both of whom derive analytical expressions for the statistical uncertainty . unlike the fouqe _",
    "et al . _  ( 1990b ) formula , however , the schneider _",
    "et al . _  ( 1990 ) formula does not include any assumptions regarding the shape of the line profile , but _ does _ include the contribution to the total error stemming from uncertainties in the baseline fit .",
    "we therefore adopt the schneider _",
    "et al . _  ( 1990 ) formula , with one modification .",
    "the formula includes a dependence on @xmath43 , the line width measured at 20% of the peak flux density .",
    "we have our own prefered width measurement algorithm which is explained in section 3.2 . because we find that the value of @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the width as measured by our favored algorithm ) is , on average , @xmath46 , we replace the @xmath47 term in schneider _ et al . _  ( 1990 ) with @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 , the statistical component of the integrated line flux error , is then given by    @xmath50    ( where @xmath51 is the r.m.s .",
    "figure , measured in the signal ",
    "free part of the spectral baseline and @xmath52 is the velocity resolution of the spectrum ) .",
    "our estimate of the total integrated line flux error , @xmath53 , is then the sum in quadrature of the error contributions from statistical noise and baseline uncertainties , noise diode calibration , and correction coefficients . for the vast majority of the galaxies in the archive ,",
    "this uncertainty is 10 - 15% of the corrected integrated flux @xmath41 .",
    "the systemic velocity of the hi line profile is usually derived as the midpoint of the segment that connects two points on opposite edges of the emission profile at a selected intensity level , usually some fraction of the mean or peak flux .",
    "the same algorithm is also used to derive the hi line width , and its extraction often dictates the choice of measurement algorithm . over the years",
    ", numerous algorithms have been applied to derive width measures that both are robust in the presence of noise and most closely reflect the disk rotational velocity ( lewis 1983 ; schneider _ et al . _  1986",
    "; chengalur _ et al . _",
    "algorithms applied originally to hi spectra contained in earlier datasets were optimized to produce consistent measurements in noisy spectra ( e.g. , bicay & giovanelli 1986 ) whereas more recent studies added emphasis on sampling the rotational velocity ( lavezzi & dickey 1997 ) .",
    "the algorithm adopted to obtain hi line velocities and line widths here is very similar to that discussed by chengalur _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) and has been previously discussed in haynes _",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the issues involved in systemic velocity and width extraction from global hi line profiles through simulations of representative cases .",
    "after identification of the flux level , @xmath54 , of each of the spectral horns , the rising side of the profile is fit by a polynomial between the levels of 15% and 85% of @xmath55 .",
    "the velocity flagged for that side of the profile @xmath56 is that for which the polynomial fit has a flux of 50% of the value of @xmath55 .",
    "this process is repeated for the other side of the profile to flag a velocity @xmath57 at the corresponding level on the other horn .",
    "the adopted velocity width , hereafter designated @xmath45 , is defined as the difference between these two velocities @xmath58 , while the system velocity is their average @xmath59 . in the vast majority of cases ,",
    "the polynomial fits are straight lines . in rare cases ,",
    "however , higher order fits are required and can be selected during the analysis stage .",
    "this procedure has a major advantage over width algorithms which measure a width as the difference in velocities between points _ on the spectrum itself _ at n% of the peak flux . under the scheme adopted here ,",
    "noise effects on either side of the profile are averaged out .",
    "additionally , the use of the parameter @xmath55 rather than simply @xmath54 substantially reduces the dependence of the measured width on the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the most important flaws in the method are encountered when it is difficult to identify the location of the horns , such as in low signal  to  noise profiles as shown in panel 2(b ) , or when one of the horns is missing as in the strongly asymmetric profile shown in panel 2(c ) ( see , e.g. richter & sancisi 1994 and haynes _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the width measurement loses objectivity and accuracy and its derived error may not reflect the true uncertainty .",
    "for this reason , we also assign a width `` quality index '' to each result listed in table 3 .    to convert @xmath45 into a physical rotational velocity , four corrections must be applied : 1 ) an instrumental correction that accounts for the spectrometer resolution , smoothing applied to the spectrum , and snr , 2 ) a cosmological redshift correction , 3 ) a correction for turbulent motions of the hi gas , and 4 ) a correction for the inclination of the disk to the line of sight .",
    "the widths presented here account for the first two effects only .",
    "the redshift correction is simply the instrumental - corrected width divided by a factor of @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the galaxy s redshift .",
    "the instrumental correction is described in the following subsection .",
    "although we do not apply such a correction , the effect of turbulent motions on the measurement of @xmath45 is discussed in section 3.2.3 .",
    "in addition to the width measurement algorithm described above , each spectrum has been measured using four additional algorithms : @xmath62 is the width measured at 50% of the mean flux density , @xmath63 is the width measured at 50% of the value of the peak flux density minus the rms value @xmath55 , @xmath43 is the width measured at 20% of the value of the peak flux density minus the rms value @xmath55 , and @xmath64 is the width measured at 50% of each of the two peaks minus the rms value .",
    "we include these values to allow the interested reader to compare our width measurement results to those of other authors . however , we have derived corrections only for @xmath45 , not for any of the additional width measurements .",
    "it is common practice to convolve radio spectra obtained with autocorrelation spectrometers with a one  channel  wide cosine function ( in practice a [ 0.25,0.5,0.25 ] three  channel function : hanning ) .",
    "this is done for two reasons .",
    "first , narrowband terrestrial interference , which occurs often within the observed spectral range even within parts of the spectrum protected by regulatory agreements for radio astronomical use , introduces `` ringing '' associated with the @xmath65 functional response of the spectrometer to single  channel  wide features . and ,",
    "second , because of the finite number of correlator channels , the true autocorrelation function is truncated , resulting in its apparent multiplication by a rectangular function which is a multiple of the autocorrelation lag time ; this in turn means that the true power spectrum has been convolved with the fourier transform of this rectangular function , itself a `` sinc function '' .",
    "the application of hanning smoothing reduces the spectral resolution of the observed spectrum . in some cases ,",
    "further spectral smoothing is required by the low snr of the observation or for other reasons ; these measurements tend to be less useful for tf applications .",
    "all the hi spectra presented here are hanning smoothed once ( smoothing code h in our data tables , e.g. haynes _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) ; in a minority of cases , as noted in our tabulations , three",
    " channel `` boxcar '' averaging plus hanning is applied instead ( smoothing code b ) .",
    "previous width measurement algorithms have often relied on measuring the width by computing the velocity difference between channels on either side of the profile .",
    "the channels are identified by either starting from inside the profile and searching outwards or starting outside and searching inwards , flagging the first channel to cross a flux limit that represents a particular fraction of the peak flux .",
    "this procedure creates a systematic bias in the width measurement as a function of the snr ( lewis 1983 ) .",
    "as described earlier , our width measurement procedure minimizes this effect by instead calculating the velocity difference between _ polynomials that have been fit to several channels_. nevertheless , there remains _ some _ dependence on the snr , defined here as the ratio of the peak hi signal to the rms noise in the line ",
    "free portion of the spectrum , which we discuss in this section .",
    "we have studied the instrumental and noise effect via simulations that incorporate autocorrelator spectrometer channel response and a variety of observed characteristics , such as profile slope and curvature .",
    "the simulations involve inputting a high resolution , noiseless profile , then binning the flux into channels , adding noise , and measuring the width of the profile using the same algorithm used also on the real data .",
    "this process is applied to a range of simulations adopting channel resolutions ranging from 5 to 11 km  s@xmath1 , for the two different smoothing prescriptions , and for a variety of different profile shapes .    to account for the spectral noise",
    ", the true snr of the spectrum can be characterized by snr @xmath66 .",
    "the broadening of the width measurement is denoted by the parameter @xmath67 , which is one half the difference between the measured width and the width that would be measured in the absence of instrumental and noise effects ( measured in channels ) .",
    "we can then account for the combined instrumental and noise effects by _ subtracting an offset _ from the measured width , parametrized as    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the spectrometer channel separation in km  s@xmath1   assumed to be equal to or very close to the channel width ) and",
    "@xmath67 depends on the snr and the type of smoothing .",
    "the simulations suggest that @xmath67 is influenced by two competing effects . as our width measurement algorithm measures a best - fit line to the sides of the profile at 50% of the value of @xmath70 , the two parameters in play are 1 ) the value of @xmath70 , and 2 ) the range of spectral values over which the line is fit .",
    "if instrumental and noise effects increase ( decrease ) @xmath70 , then @xmath67 will decrease ( increase ) , as a higher ( lower ) 50% value corresponds to a narrower ( broader ) width . even in the absence of noise ,",
    "the peak flux is depressed by channel binning and smoothing , broadening the measured width .",
    "for realistic values of snr , however , the situation is more complicated .",
    "one can characterize @xmath70 with the expression    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the flux of channel @xmath23 that one would measure in the absence of noise and @xmath73 is a gaussian random variable describing the noise contribution to channel @xmath23 .",
    "we find that profiles with steep inner slopes observed with broad channel spacings tend to produce decreasing values of @xmath70 with increasing @xmath74 .",
    "other profile shapes and spectral resolutions give a somewhat more complicated dependence .",
    "so the variation of @xmath70 affects the profile width measurement , but whether it becomes broader or narrower depends on the details of the profile shape and resolution .",
    "@xmath67 is also influenced by the range over which the line is fit to the sides of the profile .",
    "the endpoints of the fit are found by searching outward from each peak , identifying the first channels with flux less than 15% and 85% of @xmath70 .",
    "this method introduces a slight bias towards the inclusion of channels whose flux has been _ depressed _ by noise . for noisier profiles , the region over which the line is fit also moves closer to the peak of the profile , where the slope is shallower .",
    "both of these effects preferentially select channels with flux that falls _ below _ the best fit line in the noiseless case , leading to narrower width measurements .",
    "this effect dominates the dependence of @xmath67 on snr over the range @xmath75 log(snr ) @xmath76 for each of our channel resolutions and for all realistic profile shapes , meaning that @xmath67 increases with snr over that range .",
    "the simulations show that the most relevant line profile parameters in determining @xmath67 are the slopes on each side of each of the two peaks and the number of channels leading up to the peaks .",
    "while @xmath67 typically varies by @xmath31 0.5 channels for the same profile shape with different values of the snr , the variation can be even greater ( @xmath31 1 channel ) among different profile shapes _ and _ among different noise realizations of the same profile for constant snr , channel width , and smoothing prescription .",
    "this variation limits our ability to determine @xmath67 precisely for a real profile .",
    "however , we can simply apply our simulation results for a profile with mid - range values for the inner and outer slopes and number of channels leading up to the peaks .",
    "the resulting approximate solution gives :    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    the values of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are constants for both @xmath84 km  s@xmath1  and @xmath85 km  s@xmath1 , but depend linearly on @xmath69 within the range @xmath86 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the values of these parameters for each of the channel widths and smoothing prescriptions can be found in table 2 .",
    "we stress that both the linear dependence of @xmath67 on log(snr ) in the range @xmath75 log(snr ) @xmath76 and the linear dependence of the @xmath87 s on @xmath88 in the range @xmath89 km  s@xmath1  are approximate and completely empirical .",
    "we also keep the @xmath87 s constant outside the range @xmath86",
    "km  s@xmath1  solely because few of our observations have channel resolutions far outside of that range , and we have done little testing of the width corrections outside that range .",

    "scale anomalies , such as warps , bars and other global asymmetries , deviations from circular motion occur , such as those associated with small  scale dispersion and streaming motions near spiral arms .",
    "et al . _  ( 1983 ) have suggested that the contribution to the observed width of turbulent motions , or otherwise small  scale deviations from circular rotation , could be expressed via a term @xmath93 , additive to the circular width in the form : @xmath94 where @xmath23 is the disk inclination and @xmath95 the maximum rotational width .",
    "tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) found that , while a linear correction to the observed width may well account for the effect of turbulent motions on large widths , for low luminosity galaxies a quadratic combination would be more appropriate ( see also fouqu _ et al . _",
    "they thus proposed a formula , their equation 12 , that yields a linear combination at large widths , a quadratic combination at small widths , and a transitional form at intermediate widths .",
    "this formula was adopted by a variety of other authors ( e.g. , broeils 1992 ; rhee 1996 ; verheijen 1997 ) who also measure hi widths at n% of the profile peak .",
    "these authors measure the value of the @xmath93 parameter by minimizing the scatter between the turbulence - corrected velocity widths and the velocity widths determined from rotation curves of the same galaxies .",
    "verheijen ( 1997 ) reviews the results of the aforementioned authors , and notes that the optimal value of @xmath93 strongly depends on the instrumental correction used .    since we do not measure velocity widths at n% of the profile peak , and our instrumental correction differs from that of these other authors , we are not justified in adopting any of the previous values of @xmath93 .",
    "instead , we derive our own turbulent motion correction by introducing a random , isotropic @xmath96 km  s@xmath1  turbulent motion into the simulations described in the previous subsection .",
    "we find that this depresses the peak flux , and thus broadens the measured profile width by moving the @xmath97 value farther from the profile center . as in verheijen ( 1997 ) and",
    "references therein , the amount of turbulence - induced width broadening is found to vary greatly from galaxy to galaxy , depending on the details of the profile shape .",
    "we do not find a discernable trend in the amount of width broadening with profile width or signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we thus subtract the turbulence correction from the width linearly , with the equation : @xmath98 , where @xmath99 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "lavezzi & dickey ( 1997 ) likewise discuss the merits of a simple linear subtraction of a turbulence term .    as stated earlier , in order to use @xmath100 for applications such as those involving the tully - fisher relation , corrections for both inclination angle and turbulence must be applied as well . because of its uncertainty , the values of corrected width @xmath101 reported here _ do not include that correction _ , nor is viewing angle considered .",

    "in contrast to a wide area , hi blind survey like hipass , the archival dataset presented here is extremely heterogenous in terms of its sky coverage , depth and completeness . at the same time , it contains hi line spectra for more than twice as many detections as the hipass hicat ( meyer _ et al . _",
    "2004 ) , with much higher typical sensitivity and probing a greater volume .",
    "the sky distribution for all detected galaxies listed in table 3 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the unevenness of sky coverage , with strong preference for that portion of the sky visible to the arecibo telescope , is clearly evident .",
    "in fact , 77 % of the objects fall within the arecibo declination limits ( @xmath116 dec .",
    "@xmath117 ) . the southern cutoff at dec .",
    "@xmath118 represents the limitations of the steerable northern hemisphere telescopes that were used .",
    "there is also a strong deficiency of objects in the zone of avoidance , not just because the archive is comprised of objects with known optical counterparts but also because several of the previous surveys have avoided regions of high galactic extinction for reasons of photometric accuracy and completeness at optical wavelengths .",
    "the sky distribution of targeted galaxies also reflects the large scale structure within the survey volume , evident both in figure 3 and in the redshift distribution illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "the most prominent feature is the pisces - perseus supercluster at @xmath6 r.a .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath119 km  s@xmath1which has been the target of several past observing programs .",
    "also seen clearly is the virgo region toward the center of the local supercluster at r.a .",
    "@xmath120 , @xmath121 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the distributions of the rms noise per channel and snr are shown in figures 5 and 6 respectively . because of the superior gain and angular resolution of the arecibo telescope , observations undertaken with it are typically more sensitive than ones conducted with other instruments .",
    "for this reason , the fraction of the archival dataset extracted from arecibo observations is indicated separately in those figures .",
    "the diversity of the observational programs which have contributed datasets to this hi archive is evident in these distributions . in some instances ,",
    "the targetting of objects for the explicit purpose of measuring comparative hi content or accurate hi line widths has placed more stringent demands for lower rms noise values , or higher snr , than , for example , those programs that were conducted principally as wide area redshift surveys .",
    "the total integrated ( corrected ) and peak hi line flux distributions are shown in figure 7 and 8 respectively . comparing these figures to the corresponding distributions for the hipass / hicat blind hi survey shown in figure 9 of meyer _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2004 ) and figure 4 of zwaan _ et al . _  ( 2004 ) , it is readily apparent that the optically  targeted archive presented here contains a substantial number of galaxies with both integrated fluxes and peak fluxes well below those included in the hipass catalog .",
    "the hicat sample contains very few objects with @xmath122 2.5 jy  km  s@xmath1 , whereas almost one third of the optically selected sample presented here have fluxes @xmath41 lower than that value .",
    "likewise , hicat strives to be peak flux limited and contains almost no sources with peak hi fluxes below 30 mjy , whereas the majority of galaxies in the optically - selected sample have peak fluxes below that value .",
    "for an hi flux limited sample , the logarithm of the number of galaxies per unit log @xmath41 should be proportional to @xmath123 ; this relationship should also hold for the peak flux in a peak flux limited sample .",
    "the bottom panels of figures 7 and 8 show the log - log distributions of corrected flux @xmath41 and peak hi line flux @xmath124 , with the @xmath125 line superposed for reference .",
    "clearly the optically - selected sample is neither peak hi flux nor total hi flux limited as the hi - blind surveys strive to be .",
    "however , as shown in springob , haynes , & giovanelli ( 2005 ) , with the addition of supplemental data from the literature , it is possible to extract an optical diameter limited and hi flux limited subsample , restricted to the portion of the sky lying within the arecibo declination limits .",
    "figure 9 shows the distribution of instrumentally  corrected ( but not turbulence or inclination  corrected ) widths @xmath101 for all galaxies in the archive .",
    "objects with confused , asymmetric or otherwise oddly behaved spectral profiles ( coded `` c '' , `` p '' or `` f '' in table 3 ) are included in the full distribution , but profiles which are classified as `` g '' or `` s '' are included in the shaded area . in comparison to the hipass / hicat dataset , the galaxies included in this optically - selected sample are preferentially faster rotators , unsuprising given the tully  fisher relation and the much larger volume sampled here .",
    "this dataset is being used to derive the observationally - based rotational velocity function for hi disk systems ( springob , haynes & giovanelli , in preparation ) .",
    "there is one interesting issue for which much of this dataset is unfortunately largely unsuited : the study of global asymmetry in hi profiles ( richter & sancisi 1994 ; haynes _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) . as discussed in section 3.1 ,",
    "the shapes of global hi profiles observed with single dish telescopes are affected by both beam attenuation and pointing offsets and errors .",
    "prior to its recent upgrade , the arecibo telescope l - band feeds were subject to pointing errors of typically 2030  but sometimes larger , especially when the observations were conducted at large zenith angle .",
    "we therefore caution against using the spectra contained in the agc digital archive for studies of asymmetry , with the exception of the very carefully collected green bank 42  m telescope dataset obtained for that very purpose as discussed in haynes _",
    "et al . _  ( 1998 ) .",
    "we present here a compilation of hi spectral parameters for more than 9000 optically - targeted galaxies in the local universe which have been observed by us and our collaborators over the last 20@xmath4 years .",
    "all of the hi spectra have been reprocessed in a homogenous manner and a single set of algorithms has been used to extract spectral parameters which can then be corrected to physical parameters taking into account the instrument and processing  related complications such as spectral resolution , source extent , pointing offsets and signal  to  noise .",
    "we use both empirical evidence and the results of simulated observations to produce recipes for deriving these physical parameters from the observed ones based on all of the information available from the digital spectra themselves .",
    "the recent blind hi surveys such as hipass offer the advantage of completeness and homogenous data processing and parameter extraction . by reprocessing all of our existing hi line spectra using software specifically designed to exploit the details of the observing setups and the characteristics of the spectra themselves , we have tried to minimize the effects of instrument and processing  related differences among the datasets . at the same time",
    ", hi completeness issues remain in optically targeted samples , despite their greater depth and sensitivity .",
    "it is well known that optical galaxy catalogs often preferentially miss the low optical surface brightness but hi - rich late type galaxies that are common in the local universe .",
    "in contrast , blind hi surveys do not suffer from this strong bias ( rosenberg & schneider 2002 ; koribalski _ et al . _",
    "a more thorough discussion of the completeness of the agc hi compilation in the context of the derivation of the hi mass function is presented in springob , haynes & giovanelli ( 2005 ) . despite the lack of flux completeness , the redshift , emission line flux , and observed rotational widths available from the global hi line profiles collected here provide important measures of fundamental galaxy properties useful to diverse studies of galaxies in the nearby universe , especially when combined with complementary multiwavelength data .",
    "in addition to the tabulations contained herein , the actual smoothed and baseline subtracted spectra are available in digital form by contacting the authors .",
    "plans are underway to make the entire dataset availble through the us national virtual observatory in conjunction with a wide area blind hi survey to be undertaken at arecibo beginning in 2005 .",
    "this _ arecibo legacy fast alfa _ ( alfalfa ) survey will make use of the new 7feed dual polarization , l - band array ( alfa ) to survey over 7000 deg@xmath126 of the sky visible to arecibo , detecting tens of thousands of hi sources , from local , very low hi mass dwarfs to gas - rich massive galaxies seen to @xmath127 .",
    "a careful study of the detection statistics of the present optically selected sample in such a sensitive hi blind survey will provide insight into the differential characteristics of galaxies according to optical surface brightness and hi content .",
    "only the mining of datasets derived from wide area surveys conducted at multiple wavelengths will , in combination , provide the true census of all galaxies that occupy the local universe .",
