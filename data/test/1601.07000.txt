    "supergiant fast x  ray transients ( sfxts ; @xcite , @xcite ) are a sub - class of high mass x  ray binaries ( hmxbs ) that was unveiled after the discovery by the  satellite of many short hard x  ray transients in the galactic plane ( the first  source of this class was discovered by * ? ? ?",
    "sfxts host a neutron star ( ns , hereafter ) accreting from the wind of either an o or b - type supergiant and display rare outbursts punctuated by short ( @xmath01 - 2 ks ) luminous flares reaching 10@xmath210@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 , characterized by a duty cycle lower than a few % ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ps14 ) ; @xcite , @xcite ) . when observed at softer x",
    " rays ( 1 - 10 kev ) with more sensitive instruments , sfxts are caught at x  ray luminosities below 10@xmath5  erg  s@xmath4 most of the time ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in some members of the class , a luminosity as low as 10@xmath6  erg  s@xmath4 ( 1 - 10 kev ) has been observed , leading to a very high observed dynamic range ( ratio between luminosity during outburst and quiescence ) up to six orders of magnitude , in the most extreme case of the sfxt  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the sfxt flaring behavior , associated with the accretion onto the ns by a fraction of the donor wind , has been discussed by many authors .",
    "some of them explain the sfxt flares with the particular properties of the compact object ( e.g. propeller effect or magnetic gating mechanism @xcite ) , others invoke a variety of orbital geometries together with the clumpy properties of the wind of the massive star ( @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , an alternative model has been proposed to explain bright flares in sfxts @xcite , based on the instability of the quasi - spherical shell of captured matter which accumulates above the magnetosphere of a slowly rotating ns at low accretion rates @xcite .    after more than ten years from the discovery of sfxts with ,",
    "the /ibis public archive is providing us with an observational data - set of x  ray flares detected from sfxts that is large enough to enable a statistical investigation .",
    "ps14 have exploited the  archive , investigating the cumulative distributions of the hard x  ray luminosity ( 17100 kev ) of sfxt flares , finding that they follow a power - law distribution , completely different with respect to the log - normal luminosity distribution shown by the emission from persistent `` classical '' hmxbs ( e.g. , vela x1 ) .",
    "these sfxt properties were succesfully interpreted by ps14 and @xcite in terms of the model of unstable settling accretion onto slowly rotating magnetized ns @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate other important properties of the same sample of sfxt flares reported by ps14 : the waiting - time between two consecutive flares and the duration of the brightest phase of the outbursts , as observed by , in order to get more insights into the nature of these transients .",
    "we refer to ps14 for the summary of the sfxt properties adopted in the present paper .",
    "we focus here on the hard x  ray flares caught by /ibis observations covering about 9 years , from december 2002 to april 2012 ( see ps14 ) . in the present work we consider the three sfxts which show the highest dynamic range ( ,  and ) and are often referred to as `` prototypical sfxts '' in the literature .",
    "data selection and analysis have already been reported by ps14 , adopting the data reduction procedure described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to these papers for the technical details . in brief , the data - sets of detected x ",
    "ray flares consist of all ibis pointing images ( the so - called science windows , hereafter scws , with a typical exposure time of @xmath02  ks ) where the sources were within @xmath7  from the image centre and found to be active ( detection significance @xmath85@xmath9 ) .",
    "therefore , in this work we use the image deconvolution results ( @xmath10  results ) as reported by ps14 . as already discussed in ps14 , since",
    "the typical time scale of flare duration is consistent with a scw exposure time , we consider that a single ibis / isgri detection on scw level is representative of an sfxt flare .    the characterization of the luminosity distributions in hard x - rays of the sfxt flares and their energy release have been already discussed by ps14 and @xcite , respectively . in the present work",
    ", we consider the same data - set of x  ray flares selected and reported by ps14 for the three sources ,  and , with the aim of further characterizing their temporal properties .",
    "we consider the light curves of the x  ray flares ( luminosity is in the energy band 1750 kev ) detected from the three sfxts during /ibis observations spanning about 9 years .",
    "typical light curves during sfxt outbursts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_ex ] ( where each detection corresponds to a flare on scw timescale ) .",
    "we define waiting - time ( wt ) between two consecutive flares , the difference between the start times of two subsequent scws where a sfxt flare is detected .",
    "the shortest waiting - time corresponds to the duration of a scw ( in case of flares detected in adjacent scws ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wt ] we show the cumulative distribution of waiting - times between `` consecutive '' flares , for each of the three targets .    the highly populated vertical lines in fig .  [ fig : wt ] , corresponding to the shortest waiting - time ( below 0.1 days ) , are produced by flares detected in adjacent scws . at the opposite side of the x - axis ,",
    "waiting - times larger than 100  days might be significantly affected by the data gaps between two satellite visibility windows of the source sky position , as suggested by the steepening of the waiting - time distribution above 100  days , particularly evident in  and .",
    "other biases due to gaps in the data are unlikely to severily affect the shape of the true distribution at intermediate waiting - times ( between a few days and 100  days ) , given the low duty cycles of these three sfxts",
    ".    an interesting feature present in all three waiting - time distributions is a plateau just above @xmath01  day ( i.e. missing waiting - times in that temporal range ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that a waiting - time of @xmath01  day ( 1.4  day , to be precise , in order to include the last point of the plateau in ) can be adopted as a timescale to separate the flaring activity belonging to two different and subsequent outbursts ( each composed by a cluster of many flares ) .",
    "this makes it possible to derive the time duration of single outbursts and to study their statistical properties ( e.g. , cumulative distribution ) and correlations . in order to determine the total duration of a bright x  ray flaring activity episode ( a single outburst ) as observed by /ibis , we adopt the following procedure : for each sfxt , we start from the second x  ray flare detected in the /ibis light curve and calculate its waiting - time with respect to the first flare .",
    "if this waiting - time is lower than 1  day , then the flare is assumed to belong to the same bright outburst phase as the previous flare . performing this comparison with the following flares , at one point",
    "there will be a flare for which the waiting - time with respect to the immediatly previous flare is greater than 1 day . at this point",
    "the procedure stops and a list of clusters of flares ( i.e. outburst ) is produced for the three sfxts .",
    "this automatic process has led to the empirical determination of the duration of the sfxts outbursts , as observed by . to do this , we defined two different temporal quantities : the _ total duration _ ( d ) of the brightest phase of an outburst and the _ elapsed time interval _ ( @xmath11 t ) between the first and the last flare belonging to an outburst ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_ex ] , upper panel and caption , for an example ) .",
    "more in detail : for each source , for each single outburst , we calculated the total duration ( d ) simply by adding together the durations , d@xmath12 , of single flares belonging to the same outburst ( d=@xmath13 , where n is the number of flares in a single outburst ) . since the flares composing an outburst can be either detected in adjacent pointings or not , d can be interpreted as the integrated time each sfxt spends in its brightest state during a single outburst as observed by ibis .",
    "durations d lower than 2 - 3  ks imply that only one isolated flare is caught by  during a supposed ( although unobserved ) longer outburst . very likely , these single flares represent the brightest activity of outburts with average fainter luminosity , where  detects only the brightest part .",
    "another temporal quantity that can be calculated from the light curves of x  ray flares , for each outburst , is the elapsed time interval , @xmath11 t ( where @xmath11t = tstop@xmath14-tstart@xmath15 ) between the first ( `` 1 '' ) and the last ( `` n '' ) flare belonging to the same outburst ( as previously defined ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ lstab : fit ]    finally , it is interesting to note that the behaviour of the three prototypical sfxts discussed here during the bright phase of their outbursts is very similar , irrespective of the wide range of orbital periods covered ( @xmath05 , 30 and 51 days ; ps14 , @xcite ) , likely due to both the intrinsic wind properties and to the mediating role of the shell above the ns magnetosphere , in the settling accretion scenario .",
    "we have performed a characterization of the temporal properties of x  ray flares from the three most extreme sfxts , as observed by  in the energy band 1750 kev , obtaining more insights into the physics producing their outbursts .    calculating the cumulative distribution of waiting - times between the x  ray flares",
    ", we were able to identify the typical timescale that clearly separates different outbursts , composed by several single flares at @xmath0ks timescale .",
    "this selection allowed us to calculate the energy emitted during sfxt outbursts , finding an interesting correlation with the outburst duration .    in the framework of the quasi - spherical settling accretion",
    "we have discussed here , the outburst properties ( total emitted energy , duration and their positive correlation ) carry signatures of the magnetized wind structure of the companion : an sfxt outburst is composed by a chain of x  ray flares physically connected to one large region of magnetized stellar wind that triggers the ns magnetospheric instability by means of magnetic reconnection .",
    "the power - law slope of the correlation between total emitted energy and duration of the sfxt outbursts can be explained by the fractal structure of the ob - supergiant winds , reflecting the size distribution of magnetized clouds in the wind of the ob - supergiant companions .",
