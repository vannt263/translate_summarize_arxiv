    "several lines of evidence suggest that short duration gamma ",
    "ray bursts ( hereafter , sgrbs ; durations @xmath0@xmath1  s ) , or at least a sizable fraction of them , have a cosmological origin and are the electromagnetic counterpart to the coalescence of compact binary systems , such as double neutron stars ( ns ) or neutron star and black hole ( bh ; e.g. , see @xcite for reviews ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . during the merging , an accretion disk is thought to be produced by the tidal disruption of a ns around a more compact ns or before a ns is swallowed by a bh . either way , eventually the system evolves towards the formation of a bh with a debris torus around it .",
    "the resulting neutrino  cooled accretion flow leads the hyperaccreting bh to develop a collimated outflow into a pair of anti  parallel jets ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "a potential means to distinguish between ns ",
    "ns and ns ",
    "bh mergers concerns the signature of the disk and jet precession in the electromagnetic signal , i.e. the sgrb itself . in the case of a ns  bh merger",
    ", precession is expected for a tilted disk and jet due to lense  thirring torques from the bh spin ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these authors ( hereafter , slb13 ) assumed thick disks precessing as solid body rotators and built upon numerical relativity simulations of this kind of mixed mergers . according to their results , for a reasonable set of values in the parameter space , i.e. bh spin and mass , disk viscosity , misalignment angle between the accretion disk and the bh equatorial plane , a quasiperiodic modulation in the @xmath2ray signal is to be expected for a sizable fraction of ns  bh mergers .",
    "the predicted precession period @xmath3 increases with time proportionally to @xmath4 due to viscous spreading of the disk and , for a given mixed compact system , starts from a few tens ms at the beginning of the sgrb , and ends with about one order of magnitude longer values .",
    "the average expected number of cycles is just a few , typically @xmath5 . in all scenarios they considered ,",
    "these two observables lie in the range @xmath6 and @xmath7  ms@xmath8  ms , where @xmath9 is the half  way precession period for a given merger .    the aim of this letter is to search for this kind of quasiperiodic signal in the data of the brightest sgrbs detected with the _ fermi _ gamma  ray burst monitor ( gbm ; @xcite ) , the _ swift _ burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) , and the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ burst and transient source experiment ( batse ; @xcite ) , exploiting the exquisite time resolution available with these instruments .",
    "this search offers the only direct way to observationally distinguish between the two classes of progenitors based on their electromagnetic emission and naturally complements the forthcoming gravitational wave studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : data selection is described in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the technique we set up to carry out a dedicated search is outlined in section  [ sec : proc ] .",
    "results and their discussion follow in sections  [ sec : res ] and [ sec : disc ] , respectively .",
    "we took all the events observed by the _ fermi_/gbm from july 2008 to december 2012 . for each grb we extracted and summed the 1ms light curves of the two most illuminated nai detectors in the 81000  kev energy band with the heasoft package ( v6.12 ) following the _ fermi _ team threads .",
    "light curves affected by spikes due to the interactions of high  energy particles with the spacecraft were rejected @xcite .",
    "we derived the @xmath10 and @xmath11 time intervals , where the boundaries of the latter correspond to the first and the last bin whose counts exceed the 5@xmath12 signal threshold above background .",
    "we selected the sgrbs by requiring @xmath13  s  s , which was inherited from the batse catalog , must not be taken too strictly , the two populations of short and long being partially overlapped .",
    "moreover , this value strongly depends on the detector passband and triggering criteria , as proven by _",
    "swift_/bat , which detected several sgrbs with @xmath14  s ( e.g. @xcite ) . ] , and ended up with 160 grbs , 18 out of which having a minimum signal  to  noise ( s / n ) ratio of 20 , as computed over the @xmath11 interval . as far as the @xmath10 distribution is concerned , our selected sample of s / n@xmath15 sgrbs is representative of the full sample of sgrbs , as suggested by a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test .",
    "the same selection criteria were applied to the _ swift_/bat sample using all the events detected up to early june 2013 .",
    "we found 30 grbs with @xmath13  s , 12 out of which passed the final s / n@xmath15 threshold .",
    "the mask  weighted light curves had previously been extracted from the event files following the bat team threads and concern the 15150  kev detector passband .",
    "in addition to the 1ms light curves , for the two brightest events of the sample , namely 051221a and 120323a , we used @xmath16  ms resolution , to explore the very high  frequency behavior .    from an initial sample of 61 batse sgrbs with high s",
    "/ n we excluded all the cases for which the time ",
    "tagged event ( tte ) data did not cover the entire profile .",
    "unfortunately , several bright bursts were excluded , because the onboard memory could record only up to @xmath17 events around the trigger time .",
    "consequently , we were left with 14 sgrbs whose profiles were extracted in the 202000  kev energy range .    summing up , our final sample includes 44 ( 18 _ fermi _ , 12 _ swift _ , and 14 _ cgro _ ) sgrbs with high s / n ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "a finer subdivision of the final sample is provided in the following section , aimed at establishing how genuinely short each selected burst is .",
    "evidence for the existence of a third group of grbs with intermediate durations and hardness ratios between short and long ones was found by several authors for different data sets ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", we adopted the classification procedures obtained by @xcite for _ cgro_/batse and by @xcite for _ swift_/bat to assess the nature of our selected sample of bursts , based on the combination of hardness ratio ( hr ) and @xmath10 .",
    "we assigned each grb a probability @xmath18 of belonging to the short group through the `` indicator function '' , out of the three classes : short , intermediate , and long .",
    "as expected , all grbs had negligible probability of belonging to the long group .",
    "we defined as `` truly sgrb '' ( t  sgrb ) the grbs with @xmath19 .",
    "the grbs with @xmath20 are defined as `` likely sgrb '' ( l  sgrb ) , whereas the remaining cases ( @xmath21 ) were conservatively classified as `` possibly intermediate '' ( p  igrb ) .",
    "actually , several members of the p  igrb group are more likely to be genuine short than intermediate bursts . however",
    ", our choice was aimed at assuring the least possible contamination with ambiguous cases .",

    "each panel shows other catalog grbs ( crosses ) for comparison . filled circles , empty circles , and",
    "squares correspond to t ",
    "sgrbs , l  sgrbs , and p  igrbs , respectively .",
    "big ( small ) symbol sizes refer to whether each grb can ( can not ) provide useful constraints on the possible presence of pulsations using the stretched pds technique ( section  [ sec : proc]).,width=340 ]    figure  [ f : classes ] shows the hr@xmath10 diagram for the three different data sets : each panel compares the properties of our selected grbs with those of the corresponding catalog : @xcite for _ swift_/bat , @xcite and @xcite for _ fermi_/gbm , and @xcite for _ cgro_/batse .",
    "the hr values for the _ swift_/bat sample were calculated as the fluence ratio in the bands ( 50100  kev)/(2550  kev ) as in @xcite , while ( 300100  kev)/(50100  kev ) was adopted for the _ fermi_/gbm , and _ cgro_/batse sets . to compute the membership probability for the grbs detected with the _",
    "fermi_/gbm , we used the same parameters used for _ cgro_/batse owing to the similar energy passbands .",
    "although in principle this may lead to some misclassified _ fermi_/gbm grbs , in practice the two _ fermi _ t  sgrbs appear to be robustly so ( big filled circles in the mid panel of fig .",
    "[ f : classes ] ) .",
    "we studied the power density spectrum ( pds ) of each light curve in two different ways .",
    "pds were calculated adopting the leahy normalization @xcite . to fit the pds we used the technique set up by @xcite based on a bayesian treatment with markov chain monte ",
    "carlo techniques .",
    "two analytical models were assumed to describe the pds continuum : a simple power ",
    "law plus constant ( hereafter , pl ) , @xmath22 or a broken power ",
    "law plus constant ( hereafter , bpl ) , @xmath23^{-1 } + b \\qquad , \\label{eq : mod_bpl}\\ ] ] whose low ",
    "frequency index is fixed to zero . in either model",
    "the constant term accounts for the uncorrelated statistical ( white ) noise .",
    "a likelihood ratio test is used to establish the best model for each pds .",
    "this technique is particularly suitable to the temporal signal of sgrbs , because it searches for ( quasi)periodic features superposed to a red  noise process and , as such , can confidently estimate both the best fit parameters of the pds continuum and the significance of possible features superposed to it , taking into account the uncertainties of the model in a self  coherent way .",
    "moreover , the thresholds for possible periodic features correspond to @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( gaussian ) probabilities of a statistical fluctuation and already account for the multi  trial search over the whole range of explored frequencies in each individual pds .",
    "it is worth noting that power approximately fluctuates around the model according to a @xmath26 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom , i.e. more wildly than a gaussian variate .",
    "actually , the true distribution deviates from a pure @xmath26 in that the model itself is affected by uncertainties .",
    "this is properly taken into account by the procedure in determining the threshold for a given significance ( see @xcite and references therein for further details ) .",
    "the first search was performed on the observed light curves with uniform binning of 1  ms as they were observed .",
    "hereafter , times are referred to the detector trigger time .",
    "we carried out the same analysis in two different time intervals : i ) from @xmath27 to @xmath28  s ; ii ) over the @xmath11 interval .",
    "for the batse sample the analysis was carried out just over the @xmath11 intervals due to the limited memory of tte data .",
    "the two choices correspond to a fixed temporal range ( and , therefore , equal frequency resolution ) and to a s / n  driven scheme , respectively . for three grbs , namely 110705a , 120323a , and 130603b , we chose a time interval of 2  s , spanning from @xmath29 to @xmath30  s instead of the @xmath11 , to properly model the continuum shape . for 051221a and 120323a",
    "we manually selected the time intervals where the analysis was carried out to exploit at the full the @xmath16ms time resolution available in these cases : from @xmath31 to @xmath32  s , and from @xmath33 to @xmath34  s , respectively .",
    "these intervals were chosen to optimize the search for possible signals .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this search as the canonical one , since it does not modify the light curves so as to account for the increasing precession period expected by slb13 .",
    "figure  [ f:2 ] shows an example of pds with the best fit model .",
    "analogous searches which were already performed in the khz frequency range in previous data sets of sgrbs , provided only upper limits to the amplitude of possible pulsations @xcite . in the absence of any positive detection of periodic signal , we derived the @xmath35 upper limits to the amplitude of detectable periodic pulsations for the frequency range of 1030  hz .",
    "we expressed this value in terms of fractional amplitude by normalizing the amplitude limit to the peak count rate of each grb .",
    "we also performed a second , more sensitive search on the pds of the same light curves after a proper stretching of the time axis . to this aim",
    ", we devised a technique which was tailored for the expected signal . for each grb",
    ", we took the @xmath11 interval boundaries and associated two corresponding precession periods : let @xmath36 and @xmath37 the start and end times of the @xmath11 interval and let @xmath38 and @xmath39 the corresponding precession periods , respectively .",
    "we stretched the time axis according to the continuously increasing @xmath40 as described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tp ] ) @xmath41 where the constant @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 the values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 were chosen so as to match the typical values obtained by slb13 ( typically values were @xmath44 and @xmath45  s ) .",
    "we calculated the new count rates in each of the new temporal bins starting from the original photon arrival times at the detector .",
    "earlier bins at @xmath46 were left unaffected .",
    "we attributed a fictitious duration of 1  ms to the new bins .",
    "we made sure the new bins corresponded to a number of 5 bins per precession period .",
    "this automatically implies that a possible quasiperiodic pulsation such as that described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tp ] ) should correspond to a frequency @xmath47 times as small as the nyquist one ( i.e. , 200  hz in our case ) in the stretched pds .    for each sgrb of our data set",
    ", we preliminarily carried out the same analysis on a set of synthetic curves which were derived from a smoothed version of the original light curve of the sgrb .",
    "the smoothed version was then modulated with different values of fractional amplitude with a periodic signal with a period varying according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tp ] ) .",
    "for each sgrb we determined the minimum amplitude for which the pds of the synthetic stretched light curve gave a 2-@xmath12 detection .",
    "we also searched the synthetic pds adopting slightly different trial @xmath38 and @xmath39 from the exact values used to build the corresponding stretched curves . as a result ,",
    "the detection did not crucially depend on the choice of trial @xmath38 and @xmath39 within a given range .",
    "this check is important since this is the case for real curves for which the possible true periods are unknown a priori .",
    "further details on how synthetic light curves were generated and on the calibration of this technique are given in appendix  [ sec : app ] .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this search as the stretched pds one .",
    "the canonical search identified just a couple of sgrbs with power exceeding the @xmath48 threshold ( gaussian units ) in one frequency bin each .",
    "the chance probability of a @xmath48 fluctuation occurring within a given pds is @xmath49% . out of 44 different pds ,",
    "the expected number of @xmath50 fluctuations is @xmath51 , i.e. in agreement with the observed number of two cases .",

    "the amplitude is normalized to the peak count rate of each sgrb .",
    "the average minimum detectable amplitude depends on the time interval the pds is calculated : it clusters around a 3% ( 17% ) of the peak for the fixed ( @xmath52 ) time interval ( fig .",
    "[ f : upplim ] ) .",
    "likewise , we did not find any evidence for the quasiperiodic signals in the stretched pds search .",

    "fermi _ , _ swift _ , and _ cgro",
    "_ , respectively .",
    "this reduced sensitivity with respect to the canonical search is a consequence of the low number of expected cycles coupled with the statistical quality of the data .",

    "sgrbs , while the remaining 4 and 3 are l  sgrbs and p  igrbs , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : upplim_vs_sn ] , even neglecting the p  igrb group our results do not change in essence , although the reduced number of events demands caution in generalizing them to larger samples of grbs",

    "although the qpo search has given negative results , an interesting product of the canonical search is the continuum properties for an ensemble of bright sgrbs , which is studied here for the first time .",

    "yet the small number of sgrbs lacks in sensitivity to reveal fine differences .    for the sgrbs",
    "whose pds is best fit with a broken power ",
    "law , the break frequency is mostly connected to the overall duration of the main spike , whose timescale is predominant in the total pds of sgrbs .",
    "the canonical search for periodic or quasiperiodic signal did not yield any detection , in agreement with previous analogous searches @xcite , down to a limiting peak  normalized amplitude which is typically around 1020% when the pds is calculated over the @xmath52 time interval .",
    "in addition , we devised and calibrated a technique to detect the signature of a periodic signal potentially hidden within the time profiles of some sgrbs , characterized by a continuously increasing period , from a few tens ms up to a fraction of a second or so throughout the duration of sgrb . this kind of signal has theoretically been predicted in the case of a mixed merger ( ns  bh ) , where the tilted jet and accretion disk with respect to the bh spin is expected to cause the jet precession and a periodic gamma ",
    "ray signal in the prompt emission such as that described above ( slb13 ) .",
    "likewise , no significant detection at @xmath48 out of a sample of 44 sgrbs was obtained by our tailored technique , named the stretched pds search , either .",
    "however , we could extract useful upper limits to the fractional amplitude of such a modulated signal for 14 grbs , with values distributed from 10 to 90% .",
    "when we exclude the 3 grbs which appear to have a non  negligible ( @xmath54 ) probability of belonging to the intermediate duration group , the results do not change in essence .",
    "the reduced sensitivity of the stretched pds search compared with that of the canonical one is due to smaller numbers of expected cycles , which couple with a more critical dependence on s / n , as revealed by the synthetic curves used for calibration .",
    "an interesting outcome of our canonical pds search concerns the continuum properties of the pds for an ensemble of bright sgrbs ( see table in electronic format ) . unlike the case for long grbs ( e.g. ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein ) , this is the first time we could usefully study these properties for sgrbs , whose study has been hampered so far by lower s / n with respect to long grbs .",
    "this was also made possible by the bayesian procedure that was recently proposed by @xcite to properly model the pds of time series affected by a strong red noise component , such as the case of sgrbs time histories ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "two alternative models were adopted : a simple or a broken power ",
    "law in addition to the white noise constant . a preliminary comparison with the analogous properties of a sample of bright long grbs ( dichiara et al . in prep .",
    ") reveals no striking difference between the two power ",
    "law index distributions ( fig .",
    "[ f : alpha ] ) .",
    "regardless of the pds continuum interpretation , this may suggest a common general mechanism which rules the shock formation and the gamma  ray emission production .",
    "the implications of our results do not allow us to rule out the physical scenario envisaged by slb13 as the possible interpretation of the prompt emission of sgrbs for two main reasons .",
    "first of all , the sample of sgrbs for which our non  detection is meaningful is still statistically too small to draw firm conclusions .",
    "this is even more so when one neglects the few grbs which could belong to the intermediate duration group .",
    "secondly , the possibility that the few cases of interest could correspond to either other kind of mergers , such as ns  ns , or mixed mergers with unfavorable space parameters , such as the accretion disk viscosity or the misalignment angle between jet axis and bh spin , is not negligible for just a few cases . furthermore",
    ", according to the recent physical classification proposed by @xcite , there could be collapsar events disguised as sgrbs , whose presence could partially explain the observed lack of evidence for the pulsations expected for ns ",
    "bh mergers .",
    "nonetheless , in addition to being the first attempt of a dedicated search on a valuable data set , our analysis indicates that such mixed systems might not be a dominant fraction among the population of currently detected sgrbs , at least as envisaged in the model by slb13 .",
    "a definitive answer will come from a larger sample with comparable statistical quality in combination with the wealth of information that will be independently gathered through the study of gravitation wave radiation .",
    "for each sgrbs we carried out a series of simulations aimed at calibrating the sensitivity of our stretched pds search .",
    "we first binned the original curve to a rough resolution so as to reduce the high  frequency variability ( both real and statistical fluctuations ) . the smoothed version of the light curve was then obtained by interpolation of the coarse binned curve by means of c  splines .",
    "to simulate the predicted periodicity we modulated a smoothed version of the original light curve with a sinusoidal signal assuming the temporal evolution of @xmath40 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tp ] ) . specifically , to obtain the synthetic light curves we preliminarily had to calculate the pulsational phase as a function of time , @xmath55 .",
    "since @xmath56 continuously varies with time , we had to integrate the infinitesimal relation @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the infinitesimal increment to the total number of cycles starting from @xmath36 . using equation  ( [ eq : tp ] )",
