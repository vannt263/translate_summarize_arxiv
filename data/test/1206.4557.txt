    "the consensus problem , in which we ask whether the unanimity of one among different competing states ( e.g. , opinions ) is reached , and its mechanisms are of interest in various disciplines including political science , sociology , and statistical physics . in models of consensus formation , it is usually assumed that each individual possesses one of the different states that can flip over time .",
    "the flip rate depends on the environment such as the number of the individuals that adopt a different state .",
    "statistical physicists have approached this problem by analyzing a variety of models including the voter model , majority rule models , the bounded confidence model , axelrod s model , and the naming game ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "a major mechanism that would lead to consensus in a population is preference for the majority .",
    "collective opinion formation under various majority voting rules has been examined for mean - field populations @xcite and in different types of networks such as regular lattices @xcite , small - world networks @xcite , heterogeneous networks @xcite , and networks with community structure @xcite .",
    "the majority preference may be identified with the aversion to the minority . when there are only two states , they are equivalent because one state is the majority if and only if the other state is the minority",
    ". however , the two principles may be distinct when more than two states are assumed @xcite .",
    "we are concerned with this case in the present study .",
    "language competition is an example of consensus problems .",
    "the model proposed by abrams and strogatz ( as model ) accounts for extinction of endangered languages @xcite .",
    "the as model implements competition between two languages for speakers in a population . the dynamics of the model is based on the majority preference , which is also regarded as the minority aversion because there are just two competing languages .",
    "several authors found that different languages can stably coexist in variants of the as model .",
    "two languages can coexist by spatial segregation in a model in which competition dynamics and spatial diffusion are combined @xcite . a lotka ",
    "volterra variant of the as model also leads to coexistence @xcite .",
    "introduction of bilingual individuals also enables coexistence @xcite .",
    "castell and colleagues investigated variants of the as model with bilingualism on various networks @xcite . coexistence also occurs when the attractiveness of languages is dynamically manipulated @xcite or when bilingualism , horizontal ( i.e. , from adults to adults ) and vertical ( i.e. , from adults to children ) transmission of languages , and dynamics of the languages attractiveness are combined @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we extend the as model to the case of competition among a general number of languages , denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "our model is a mean - field model ( i.e. , without spatial or network structure ) , as is the original as model . because the as model has been used for modeling competition of other cultural or social traits such as religion @xcite , opinion , and service sectors @xcite , we use the term `` state '' instead of `` language '' in the following .",
    "we show that the behavior of the model is essentially different between @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ". in particular , the coexistence of different states and the consensus can be multistable , i.e. , the coexistence and consensus equilibria are both stable , only when @xmath2 .",
    "we extend the as model to the case of competition among @xmath0 states .",
    "the dynamics of the fraction of state @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fraction of state @xmath4 in the population , and @xmath8 represents the transition rate from state @xmath9 to state @xmath4 .",

    "the transition rates of the original as model ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 controls the strength of the frequency - dependent state transition , @xmath13 is the attractiveness of state @xmath4 , and @xmath14 @xcite . because @xmath15 simply specifies the time scale of the dynamics , we set @xmath16 .",
    "equation   allows two interpretations : majority preference because @xmath17 and minority aversion because @xmath18 .",
    "the two principles lead to the same model when @xmath1 .",
