    "it is still unknown how the central engine of long gamma - ray bursts ( hereafter it is called as grbs for simplicity ) is working at the center of massive stars . in other words",
    ", we poorly know the engine that drives the most powerful explosion in the universe . some of the supernovae that associate with grbs were very energetic .",
    "their energies were of the order of @xmath4 ergs , which is @xmath5 times larger than the ones of normal core - collapse supernovae .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that other engine from the one of normal core - collapse supernovae should be working at the center of the grb s progenitors .",
    "there are some possible scenarios to drive a grb jet .",
    "one of the most promising scenarios is the collapsar scenario ( @xcite ) . in this study",
    ", we investigate the collapsar scenario . in the collapsar scenario ,",
    "a black hole is formed as a result of gravitational collapse . also ,",
    "rotation of the progenitor plays an important role . due to the rotation",
    ", an accretion disk is formed around the equatorial plane . after the formation of the accretion disk ,",
    "there are several possible stories as below .",
    "one is that a jet - induced explosion along the rotation axis may occur due to the heating through neutrino anti - neutrino pair annihilation that are emitted from the accretion disk  @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting possibility , although neutrino heating efficiency looks small ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "a very careful treatment of neutrino transfer with conserved - scheme of hydrodynamics will be necessary to prove that this effect is the key - process of grb s engine .",
    "another is that a jet is driven by extracting rotational energies of the accretion disk with a help of magnetic fields that pierce the disk ( blandford - payne effect : @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is also investigated by several authors  @xcite .",
    "this is also a promising possibility .",
    "further study will be necessary whether a relativistic jet will be launched by this mechanism .",
    "recently , the effect of extraction of rotation energy from the black hole through outgoing poynting flux ( blandford - znajek effect : @xcite ) is investigated by using a general relativistic magneto - hydro dynamics ( grmhd ) code  @xcite .",
    "energy extraction from a rotating black hole is a general relativistic effect , so grmhd code is necessary to investigate the effect . in barkov and komissarov ( 2008 ) , they showed that a jet is launched by blandford - znajek effect using a kerr black hole with kerr parameter ( @xmath7=0.9 ) and a polytrope density profile for a massive star model . in their successive papers ( komissarov and barkov ( 2009a ) , barkov and komissarov 2010 ) , they also succeeded to launch a jet by blandford - znajek effect ( kerr parameter was chosen to be 0.9 in komissarov and barkov 2009a , while 0.46 and 0.6 in barkov and komissarov 2010 ) using a polytrope density profile for a massive star model . in nagataki ( 2009 ) , it was shown that a jet is launched by blandford - znajek effect ( kerr parameter was chosen to be 0.5 ) using a realistic progenitor model developed by woosley and heger ( 2006 ) .",
    "in nagataki ( 2009 ) , it was pointed out that blandford - payne effect may be also working .",
    "as stated above , in the previous papers , it was shown that a jet is successfully launched by blandford - znajek effect . however , there is no systematic study how the dynamics depends on the kerr parameter .",
    "it is true that komissarov and barkov ( 2010 ) presented results for different kerr parameters , but they also changed the amplitude of the initial magnetic fields .",
    "also , no simulation has been reported for @xmath8 , that is , schwartzschild black hole case . by performing a simulation for that case",
    ", we can clearly see how effectively the rotating black hole is working to drive the jet . in this study",
    ", we present 4 simulations for the same initial condition with nagataki ( 2009 ) , but with different kerr parameters @xmath00 , 0.5 , 0.9 , 0.95 .",
    "it is shown clearly that a more rapidly rotating black hole is driving a more energetic jet .",
    "especially , in the case of the schwartzschild case , no jet is found .",
    "that proves that the jet is really driven by the rotating black hole .    in section [ method ] , method of calculation",
    "is explained . in section [ initial ] , initial condition is shown .",
    "results are given in section [ result ] .",
    "discussion is presented in section [ discussion ] .",
    "conclusion is stated in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this study , we use the grmhd code developed in nagataki ( 2009 ) .",
    "thus we briefly explain the method of calculation here , and please see nagataki ( 2009 ) for details .    in nagataki ( 2009 )",
    ", we have developed a two - dimensional grmhd code following gammie et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and noble et al .",
    "we have adopted a conservative , shock - capturing scheme with harten , lax , and van leer ( hll ) flux term ( @xcite ) and flux - interpolated constrained transport technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use a third - order total variation diminishing ( tvd ) runge - kutta method for evolution in time , while monotonized central slope - limited linear interpolation method is used for second - order accuracy in space ( @xcite ) .",
    "2d scheme ( 2-dimensional newton - raphson method ) is usually adopted for transforming conserved variables to primitive variables ( @xcite ) .    when we perform simulations of grmhd , modified kerr - schild coordinate",
    "is basically adopted with mass of the black hole ( @xmath9 ) fixed where the kerr - schild radius @xmath10 is replaced by the logarismic radial coordinate @xmath11 .",
    "when we show the result , the coordinates are transfered from modified kerr - schild coordinates to kerr - schild ones . in the following , we use @xmath12 unit .",
    "@xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the speed of light , and @xmath9 is the gravitational mass of the black hole at the center .",
    "the initial condition is also same with nagataki ( 2009 ) , but for different kerr parameters .",
    "thus we explain it briefly here , and please see nagataki ( 2009 ) for details .",
    "the calculated region corresponds to a quarter of the meridian plane under the assumption of axisymmetry and equatorial symmetry .",
    "the spherical mesh with 256(@xmath10)@xmath15 128(@xmath16 ) grid points is used for all the computations .",
    "the radial grid is nonuniform , extending from @xmath170.98@xmath18 to 3@xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the outer horizon , and 3@xmath21 corresponds to 8.9@xmath22 cm in cgs units ) with uniform grids in the modified kerr - schild coordinate .",
    "we adopt the model 12tj in woosley and heger ( 2006 ) ( as for the progenitor evolution model , see e.g. , tutukov and fedorova 2007 ) .",
    "this model corresponds to a star that has 12@xmath23 initially with 1@xmath24 of solar metallicity , and rotates rapidly and does not lose its angular momentum so much by adopting small mass loss rate . as a result ,",
    "this star has a relatively large iron core of @xmath25 , and rotates rapidly at the final stage .",
    "we assume that the central part of the star has collapsed and formed a black hole of 2@xmath23 . since @xmath26 , @xmath27 corresponds to 2.95 @xmath28 cm .",
    "we also assume that the gravitational mass of the black hole is unchanged throughout the calculation . in nagataki ( 2009 )",
    ", the kerr parameter , @xmath7 , was assumed to be 0.5 , but in this study we perform simulations for @xmath0 0 , 0.5 , 0.9 , 0.95 , respectively ( we name them as model a , b , c , d , respectively ) .",
    "since 1-d calculation is done for the model 12tj , we can use the data directly for the physical quanta on the equatorial plane . as for the density , internal energy density , and radial velocity , we assume the structure of the star is spherically symmetric .",
    "we also set @xmath29 initially .",
    "as for @xmath30 , we extrapolate its value such as @xmath31 .",
    "we assume the vector potential @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the peak density in the progenitor ( after extracting the central part of the progenitor that has collapsed and formed a black hole ) .",
    "the field is normalized so that the minimum value of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the thermal pressure and @xmath36 is the magnetic pressure .",
    "we use a simple equation of state @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the internal energy density .",
    "we set @xmath39=4/3 so that the equation of state roughly represents radiation gas .    as for the boundary condition in the radial direction",
    ", we adopt the outflow boundary condition for the inner and outer boundaries . as for the boundary condition in the zenith angle direction , axis of symmetry boundary condition",
    "is adopted for the rotation axis , while the reflecting boundary condition is adopted for the equatorial plane . as for the magnetic fields , the equatorial symmetry boundary condition , in which the normal component is continuous and",
    "the tangential component is reflected , is adopted .",
    "in figure [ fig:1 ] , contours of rest mass density in logarismic scale for all models at the same time - slice @xmath40 ( that corresponds to 1.5760 sec ) are shown .",
    "cgs units are used for the rest mass density , while the length in the vertical / horizontal axes is written in @xmath12 unit . @xmath27 and 4000 corresponds to 2.95 @xmath28 cm and 1.18 @xmath41 cm , respectively .",
    "these results are projected on the ( r sin@xmath16 , r cos @xmath16)-plane .",
    "upper left panel shows the state of model a ( @xmath8 ) , upper right panel shows the one of model b ( @xmath42 ) , lower left panel shows the one of model c ( @xmath43 ) , and lower right panel shows the one of model d ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is clearly shown that the rotating black hole drives the jet ( the schwartzschild black hole can not drive a jet ( model a ) , while a more rapidly rotating black hole is driving a stronger jet ) .    from figure [ fig:2 ] to [ fig:6 ] , we show the results for model d at @xmath40 ( that corresponds to 1.5760 sec ) .",
    "the length in the vertical / horizontal axes is written in @xmath12 unit ( @xmath44 correspond to 2.95 @xmath28 cm , 5.9 @xmath45 cm , 2.95 @xmath46 cm , respectively ) .    in figure [ fig:2 ] , color - contours of rest mass density in logarismic scale ( cgs units ) with velocity fields ( arrows ) are shown .",
    "it is noted that stagnation region where the radial velocity becomes positive ( outgoing ) from negative ( accreting ) is seen around @xmath47 in the jet .",
    "in contrast , it is shown later ( in figure [ fig:5 ] ) that outgoing poynting flux is positive from the outer horizon .    in figure",
    "[ fig:3 ] , color - contours of rest mass density in logarismic scale ( cgs units ) with contours of the @xmath48 component of the vector potential ( @xmath49 ) are shown .",
    "level surfaces coincide with poloidal magnetic field lines , and field line density corresponds to poloidal field strength .",
    "upper panel shows the central region ( @xmath50 ) , while lower panel shows the wider region ( @xmath51 ) . in the upper panel ,",
    "the ordered poloidal field lines are seen in the jet . in the lower panel , a wall - like structure that contains vertical magnetic fields",
    "is seen .    in figure [ fig:4 ] , contours of total pressure ( sum of thermal and magnetic pressure ) in logarismic scale .",
    "cgs units are used for the pressure contours are shown .",
    "it is clearly seen that the wall - like structure has high pressure : it is higher than the one in the jet region .    in figure [ fig:5 ] , contours of outgoing poynting flux ( @xmath52 in eq.[bzeq1 ] ) in logarismic scale .",
    "it is noted that the total energy flux , which is the integrated outgoing poynting flux over the zenith angle , can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determinant of the metric and ( @xmath10,@xmath56 ) component of energy - momentum tensor of electro - magnetic fields .",
    "the unit of the contours is @xmath1 erg s@xmath57 sr@xmath57 .",
    "outer horizon is seen at the center ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that outgoing poynting flux is coming out from the outer horizon .",
    "this figure clearly shows that blandford - znajek process is working in this system .",
    "we could see also a powerful outgoing poynting flux toward the accretion disk .",
    "partially this may be working for the variability of the mass accretion rate seen in nagataki ( 2009 ) .    in figure [ fig:6 ] ,",
    "contours of the electro - magnetic field energy flux per unit rest - mass flux are shown , which represent the bulk lorentz factor of the invischid fluid element when all of the electro - magnetic field energy are converted into kinetic energy ( @xcite ) . even though the bulk lorentz factor of the jet is still low ( of the order of unity ) , the terminal bulk lorentz factor can be relativistic .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig:7 ] , plots of the jet energy for all models at @xmath40 are shown .",
    "the definition of the jet energy is : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ( @xmath56,@xmath56 ) component of total energy - momentum tensor and integration is done only for the region where @xmath61 ( radial component of 4-velocity of fluid ) is positive .",
    "it is noted that the contribution of the rest mass energy is subtracted .",
    "factor 2 is coming from the symmetry of the system with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "blue curve represents the jet energy within the opening angle @xmath62 , while red curve represents the one within @xmath63 .",
    "the unit of vertical axis is @xmath64 erg .",
    "it is clearly seen that a more rapidly rotating black hole is driving a stronger jet .",
    "the total energy of the jet for model d ( @xmath2 ) is as large as @xmath1 erg . for comparison , the analytic curves of the bz - flux formulation of tchekhovskoy et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for the case of monopole solution b=@xmath65 g are shown by the red - dashed curve ( until forth power of @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the horizon of the black hole ) .",
    "the analytic curve of the bz - flux formulation of tanabe and nagataki ( 2008 ) for the case of b=@xmath65 g is shown by the black - dashed curve ( until forth power of @xmath7 ) .",
    "it is seen that the jet energy obtained in this study fits well with the previous analytical formulations .",
    "\\1 . whole picture . + in section",
    "[ result ] , we could see that a stronger jet is driven by a more rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "it is clear that the rotating black hole is driving the jet .",

    "the total energy of the jet for model d ( @xmath2 ) is as large as @xmath1 erg .",
    "we showed some figures for model d to understand the dynamics more clearly .",
    "we have found that ( i ) the stagnation region is seen around @xmath47 in the jet region , ( ii ) the ordered poloidal field lines are seen in the jet ( that is consistent with other previous study on the jet formation from a torus ( e.g. @xcite ) ) , ( iii ) the jet region is surrounded by a wall - like structure that has a higher pressure than the jet region and contains strong vertical magnetic fields , and ( iv ) the jet is initiated by outgoing poynting flux from the outer horizon .",
    "effect ( blandford - znajek effect ) .",
    "\\2 . wall - like structure .",
    "+ we found the wall - like structure around the jet .",
    "it is considered that the structure will depend on the initial angular momentum and density profile of the progenitor star and initial configuration and its strength of magnetic fields .",
    "we should investigate this feature by performing some simulations systematically as a next step .",
    "however , this wall - like structure seems not to work so much for the formation and collimation of the jet , because the collimated jet has been launched already before the formation of the wall - like strucuture .",
    "jet energy .",
    "+ it has been shown that the jet energy can be as large as @xmath1 erg in 1.5 sec for model d. thus we expect that the energy of the jet can be @xmath68 erg in 10 sec , and we can say that blandford - znajek mechanism is very promising to drive a grb jet . on the other hand , for a slowly - rotating black hole case , the jet power looks too low , because the luminosity of a grb jet ( @xmath69 erg s@xmath57 ) is hard to explain .",
    "thus it is concluded that a rapidly rotating black hole is favored ( faster is better ) .",
    "this result is consistent with some previous test calculations @xcite . due to the limit of computational resources",
    ", we had to stop the simulation at @xmath40 in this study .",
    "we are going to present a simulation that should last more than 10 sec in the near future .",
    "lorentz factor .",
    "+ it is found that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet can not be so high in this study ( of the order of unity ) , although the electro - magnetic field energy flux is much greater than rest - mass flux in the jet , which was also seen in nagataki ( 2009 ) .",
    "we believe this jet has a good property , because the jet speed will become relativistic if the electro - magnetic field energy is converted to kinetic energy through the propagation . also , we can be optimistic because the wall - like structure was found in our simulations .",
    "it is pointed out that such a wall is necessary to drive a relativistic jet in some papers @xcite",
    ". moreover , there have been many papers on the propagation of relativistic jet from a massive star  @xcite where the jet is driven by injecting energy from the inner boundary .",
    "some of their results suggest that the bulk lorentz factor of the jet will be increasing with time ( e.g. @xcite ) because the material of the progenitor star is blown off and the jet region becomes cleaner with time .",
    "thus we expect that a relativistic jet will be seen if we perform a simulation for a longer time scale ( of the order of @xmath3 sec .",
    "see also suwa and ioka 2010 ) .",
    "\\5 . blandford - payne effect .",
    "+ in this study , we showed that blandford - znajek effect is working . on the other hand",
    ", it was found that no jet was driven with a help of rotation of the accretion disk ( blandford - payne effect ) in model a ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "of course there is a possibility that the disk will drive a jet later .",
    "also , the interaction between the rotating black hole and the accretion disk may be important .",
    "that is , if the rotating black hole is connected with the accretion disk by magnetic fields and rotation power is conveyed to the disk , blandford - payne effect will become more effective .",
    "further study will be necessary to conclude the necessity of blandford - payne effect to drive a grb jet .",
    "\\6 . microphysics .",
    "+ in this study , microphysics such as neutrino physics and nuclear reaction is not included .",
    "the disk structure is deformed by neutrino cooling process @xcite .",
    "nucleosynthesis study provides us with an opportunity to compare the simuations with observations of supernova ejecta and supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "we are planning to include these microphysics as a next step .",
    "3d simulation .",

    ". it will be important to compare the 2d simulations with 3d ones . in 3d simulations , hydrodynamic instability in the azimuthal direction",
    "will be seen  @xcite .",
    "we have performed 4 simulations of collapsars with different kerr parameters @xmath00 , 0.5 , 0.9 , 0.95 .",
    "it is clearly shown that a more rapidly rotating black hole is driving a more energetic jet .",
    "no jet is seen for the case of model a ( @xmath8 ) , while the total energy of the jet for model d ( @xmath2 ) is as large as @xmath1 erg .",
