    "science , whether in its pure or applied form , is frequently related to the description of the behaviour exhibited by systems when some quantity approaches a particular value .",
    "we might consider the effect on the state of a particle as we furnish it a certain energy , @xmath9 , when this quantity tends to some critical value , @xmath10 , or the response of a system when the number of elements goes to infinity , like it usually occurs in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics , i.e. , the _",
    "thermodynamic limit_. in the latter case , we may focus on the outcome of the addition , or arithmetic average , of a large ( infinite ) sequence of random variables associated with a certain observable .",
    "this constitutes the basis of the celebrated central limit theorem ( clt ) , which is at the core of the theory of probabilities and mathematical statistics .",
    "the clt has its origin at the weak law of large numbers of jacob bernoulli @xcite . for independent random variables , it had its first version introduced by abraham de moivre in @xmath11 @xcite , who used the normal distribution to approximate the functional form of a binomial distribution for a large number of events . in @xmath12 ,",
    "his result was later extended by pierre - simon laplace , who formulated the now called _ theorem of de moivre - laplace _ @xcite .",
    "laplace also used the normal distribution in the analysis of errors in experiments , but it was carl friedrich gauss who first proved , in @xmath13 , the connection between error in measurement and the normal distribution .",
    "it is due to this relation that the normal distribution is widely called in physics as _",
    "although discovered more than once by different people , the fact is that only in @xmath14 , mathematician aleksandr lyapunov defined the clt in general terms and proved it in a precisely mathematical fashion @xcite .",
    "after the establishment of a central limit theorem for the addition of independent random variables with finite second - order moment , other versions have appeared , namely , the _ lvy - gnedenko extension _ for the sum of independent random variables with diverging second - order moment levy , gnedenko , the _ m - dependent central limit theorem _ , _ martingale central limit theorem _",

    "we analyse , both analytically and numerically , the sum of conventional independent random variables and show that , in this case , the attractor in  probability space is the gaussian distribution if random variables have a finite second - order moment , or the @xmath16-stable lvy distributions otherwise .",
    "statistical mechanics , _ i.e. _ , the application of statistics to large populations whose state is governed by some hamiltonian functional , is strongly attached to the concept of entropy originally introduced by rudolf julius emmanuel clausius in @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the relation between entropy and the number of allowed microscopic states was firstly established by ludwig eduard boltzmann in @xmath18 when he was studying the approach to equilibrium of an ideal gas  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this relation is,@xmath19where @xmath20 is a positive constant and @xmath21 the number of microstates compatible with the macroscopic state .",
    "this equation is known as _",

    "( [ boltz - prin ] ) under some assumptions , the boltzmann - gibbs entropy , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the probability of microscopic configuration @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics is based on the molecular chaos  @xcite and ergodic  @xcite hypotheses @xcite .",
    "it has been very successful in the treatment of systems in which _ short _ spatio / temporal interactions dominate . in this case ,",
    "ergodicity and independence are justified and khinchin s approach to @xmath25 is valid  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears as entirely plausible that physical entropies other than the boltzmann - gibbs one , can be defined in order to treat anomalous systems , for which ergodicity and/or independence are not verified .    inspired by this kind of systems it was proposed in @xmath26 @xcite the entropy  @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) as the basis of a possible extension of boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics @xcite where the _ entropic index _",

    "@xcite , hence in compliance with clausius concept on macroscopic entropy and thermodynamics , for a special class of _ correlated _ systems .",
    "more precisely , systems whose phase - space is occupied in a ( asymptotically ) scale - invariant manner .",
    "it is upon this kind of correlations that the @xmath2-generalised central limit theorems are constructed .    at this stage",
    "let us emphasize the difference between the _ additivity _ and _ extensivity _ concepts for entropy .",
    "an entropy is said to be _ additive _ if @xcite if for two _ probabilistically independent _",
    "systems , let us say @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the total entropy equals the sum of the entropies for the two independent systems , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath33 . according to this definition , boltzmann - gibbs entropy , @xmath25 , and rnyi entropy , @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 $ ] , are _ additive _ , while @xmath15 ( @xmath36 ) , among others @xcite , is _ nonadditive_. despite the fact of being nonadditive , @xmath15 , just as additive entropies @xmath25 and @xmath34 , is _",
    "composable _ , as already mentioned . by this we mean that , for a system composed by two independent subsystems , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , if we know the entropy of each sub - system , then we are able to evaluate the entropy of the entire system .",
    "composability for @xmath25 and @xmath34 is a consequence of its additivity , whereas for @xmath15 it results from the fact that , considering independent subsystems , the total entropy satisfies@xmath37on the other hand , an entropy is defined as _ extensive _ whenever the condition,@xmath38is verified ( @xmath39 represents the number of elements of the system ) . in this definition ,",
    "the correlation between elements of the system is arbitrary , _ i.e. _ , _ it is not important to state whether they are independent or not_. if the elements of the system are independent ( e.g. , the ideal gas , the ideal paramagnet ) , then the additive entropies @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) are extensive , whereas the nonadditive entropy @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is nonextensive . in such case",
    "we have @xmath45where @xmath46 is the entropy of one element when it is considered as isolated . furthermore , for short - range interacting systems , _",
    "i.e. _ , whose elements are only asymptotically independent ( _ e.g. _ , air molecules at normal conditions ) , i.e. , strict independence is now violated , @xmath25 and @xmath41 still are extensive , whereas @xmath43 ( @xmath47 ) still is nonextensive . for such systems , @xmath48 .",
