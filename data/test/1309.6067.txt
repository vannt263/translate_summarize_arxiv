    "much of the computational effort in solving the kohn - sham equations of density functional theory ( dft)@xcite is spent in iteratively updating the screened effective potential .",
    "this procedure requires the calculation of the electronic density , obtained over a sum of all occupied kohn - sham eigenstates .",
    "the required number of states ( bands ) therefore scales with the number of atoms . for the calculation of optical or transport properties ,",
    "only the bands close to the band gap are required , which represents , for a large number of atoms , only a small fraction of the total number of bands required for the calculation of the total energy in a self - consistent formalism .",
    "an approach that bypasses the calculation of the entire spectrum and focuses on states close to the band gap is the semi - empirical pseudopotential approach.@xcite in this approach the pseudopotential is derived from a dft calculation in the local density approximation ( lda ) and subsequently empirically corrected to reproduce experimental _ target _ properties , such as the optical band gap .",
    "these semi - emipirical pseudpotentials ( seps ) were derived for cdse and inp and their accuracy demonstrated.@xcite in this work , we follow a similar procedure for the derivation of nitride seps .",
    "former treatment of nitrides were at the level of empirical pseudopotentials ( as opposed to seps ) which assume an empirical analytic functional dependence ( a sum of gaussians ) instead of being obtained from dft - lda and include only a local component , while the seps are angular momentum dependent non - local ( or semi - local ) potentials.@xcite these empirical pseudopotentials have a parametric strain dependence that is important and more intricate in the case of nitrides than for the case of iii - v semiconductors.@xcite our derivation of seps for nitrides leads to pseudopotentials that are slightly more expensive computationally ( they have an angular momentum dependent semi - local component and a slightly larger energy cut - off ) but more accurate and transferable .",
    "there is no need for an explicit empirical parametric strain dependence .",
    "the advantages of seps compared to the local empirical pseudopotentials have been discussed earlier , generally to zinc - blende semiconductors.@xcite in this work we have extended the sep formulation to wurtzite semiconductors , and more specifically to gan .    the second development that was necessary to properly address nitride nanostructures was the problem of the passivation . in earlier work",
    "@xcite the dangling bonds of nanostructures were passivated by empirical gaussian potentials .",
    "the three parameters describing the passivant , namely the width and height of the gaussian and its distance to the passivating atom , were varied until the surface states , that fill the gaps of most unpassivated semiconductors , disappears .",
    "this fitting procedure was originally done manually and subsequently automatized using a minimization procedure.@xcite even in the case of the exhaustive numerical search of the configuration space , some materials could not be properly passivated .",
    "this fact is probably due to the lack of flexibility in the gaussian function used . in this paper",
    "we describe our approach to obtain passivant potentials .",
    "it is based on the dft - lda calculation of a passivated and an unpassivated ( bare ) slab . from the difference of both calculations",
    "we extract an effective passivant potential in real space .",
    "we can accurately fit the numerical results to a yukawa - type potential .",
    "once the bulk seps for a given material are found , together with its corresponding passivants pseudopotentials , the study of the electronic structure and related properties of nanostructures can be performed .",
    "we have chosen as an example to apply the sep method to gan nanowires,@xcite a promising nanostructure in the field of solar cells and optoelectronic devices due to the wide band gap of gan ( 3.5 ev ) , that together with indium nitride , a narrow band gap semiconductor ( 0.67 ev ) can cover the full visible solar spectrum by a proper alloying.@xcite more specifically , we explore the effects of confinement in the valence and conduction band states close to the nanowire band gap and we discuss the influence of confinement on the optical properties .",

    "a more detailed discussion concerning the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential can be found elsewhere.@xcite the potential @xmath6 is a periodic function and can be expanded in a fourier series : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the set of the reciprocal lattice vectors of the corresponding crystal structure with unit cell volume @xmath9 .",
    "we now express the periodic potential @xmath6 as a sum over atom - centered potentials @xmath10 : @xmath11 where we use capital letters for crystal potentials and lower case letters for the corresponding atomic potentials .",
    "the vectors @xmath12 are the basis vectors of the crystal unit cell and @xmath13 are the atomic positions of the atoms @xmath14 in the unit cell corresponding to @xmath12 .",

    "so far the procedure to obtain @xmath40 is exact .",
    "however , for an efficient implementation it is convenient to assume that the screened pseudopotentials are well represented by their spherically averaged counterparts @xmath41 . at this stage",

    "[ bulkpot ] we plot the corresponding gallium and nitrogen semiempirical pseudopotentials . concerning the general behavior of the pseudopotentials ,",
    "the oscillations persist until @xmath56  bohr@xmath47 , which determines the energy cut - off in the subsequent calculations ( with a energy cutoff of 30 ry ) .",
    "the last step is the solution of the kohn - sham equation  , where the kohn - sham potential @xmath1 is replaced by the semiempirical pseudopotentials calculated above , and the nonlocal term @xmath57 .",
    "this equation needs to be solved only once , since there is no need to achieve self - consistency .",
    "we proceed by comparing the band structures calculated using the sep method and the lda .",
    "as the spin - orbit interaction only produces minor splittings in gan , we have neglected this interaction for the overall band structure comparison , but it will be introduced later on , once the validity of the sep method has been demonstrated .",

    "the reduction of the enegy cut - off from 90 ry to 30 ry lead to a rigid displacement of the conduction bands towards lower energy , reducing the band gap approximately by 1 ev .",
    "the valence band states most affected by the reduction of @xmath60 are those far from the top of the valence band , at around @xmath61 ev .",
    "the topmost valence band states remain almost unaltered , and belong to the @xmath62 representation , in agreement with the _ ab initio _ band structure .",
    "we conclude that the lda and the sep band structures are in good agreement for the bands close to the band gap , i.e. , the most important part of the band structure in , e.g. , photoluminescence experiments .     and @xmath63 indicates the path in the brillouin zone .",
    "the lda band - gap is 2.7 ev , 1.6 for unshifted sep and 3.5 for shifted sep . ,",
    "width=7 ]    another important issue in _ ab initio _ calculations of semiconductors is the underestimation of the band gap undermining the lda.@xcite such underestimation is enhanced , in this special case , if the energy cut - off is reduced . in the sep - method",
    "one can correct this problem easily by multiplying the local potentials by a gaussian function or renormalizing the nonlocal pseudopotentials.@xcite in this work we have chosen the second possibility where we act on the non - local angular momentum @xmath64-channel .",
    "figure  [ sepbulk ] shows the band structure of the band gap corrected seps .",
    "the band gap opening does not influence significantly the valence band , although a slight modification is appreciated in the vicinity of the @xmath54 point , which produces a change in the curvature , as expected from the decreased coupling with the valence bands .",
    "the conduction band effective mass for the corrected seps is now @xmath65 , in good agreement with the reported experimental value of @xmath66 ( being @xmath67 the free - electron mass).@xcite    for energy cut - offs lower than 30 ry , the changes in the band structure exceed the admissible margin .",
    "the wave functions of the top of the valence band and of the bottom of the conduction band have the same symmetry and shape than the lda wave functions .",
    "as noted above , the atoms at the free surfaces of a nanostructure have dangling bonds .",
    "the existence of these dangling bonds generates electronic states localized at the surface , with energies usually within the band gap of the semiconductor.@xcite these states can have energies close to the conduction and valence band edges , and can induce an artificial modification of the conduction and valence band states , and they have to be eliminated.@xcite in the literature two methods are used to overcome this difficulty .",
    "the first possibility is to achieve quantum confinement by embedding the structure into a virtual material with a high band gap @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage of using this virtual material is the associated increase in the number of atoms .",
    "another way consists of attaching an atom , usually hydrogen , to the dangling bonds ( the so - called passivation ) , which displaces the energies of the surfaces states far from the band gap.@xcite however , the determination of the hydrogen pseudopotentials is not a trivial task , and it can depends on the material and of the surface orientation .",
    "the simplest way is to model the passivant pseudopotential by an analytical function , such as a gaussian .",
    "the method to optimize the form of the gaussian function can be a simple trial and error procedure , or a more sophisticated approach , such as a genetic algorithm , as developed in ref .",
    "however , the empirical parametrized gaussian pseudopotentials involve iterative calculations of the electronic structure , which complicates the computational task , and does not always guarantee to achieve an adequate passivation .",
    "in this work , we propose to derive the passivant pseudopotentials from lda calculations of a small free - standing structure . in the following",
    "we describe the necessary steps and illustrate them by an example for the @xmath68 surface of gan .",
    "_ step 1 : ab initio calculation of the self - consistent potential . _",
    "the self - consistent potential is calculated for two free - standing @xmath68 gan layers . a bare layer ( unsaturated dangling bonds ) and a passivated layer ( a hydrogen attached to each dangling bond ) .",
    "specifically , the gan layer is approximately 15 angstrom thick ( 24 atoms ) , and the vacuum layer is about 10 angstrom on both sides to prevent coupling between layers .",
    "the input hydrogen norm - conserving potential is taken to be the same for the hydrogen atoms bound to the gallium and the nitrogen atom . in the case of materials with metallic surfaces ( e.g. cdse ) ,",
    "a satisfactory passivation may require hydrogen potentials with fractional charges .",
    "for the atomic positions , we fix the nitrogen and gallium atoms to their bulk ideal positions and relax only the distance between the hydrogen atoms ( usually two atoms on each side of the slab ) and the corresponding passivated atom.@xcite    the band structures of the bare slab ( without geometry optimization ) and passivated @xmath69 $ ] slab ( with optimization of the distance of hydrogen atoms with respect to gan ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ abo_layer](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "note that the bands are rather flat along the @xmath70 direction , which confirms the decoupling between adjacent layers .",
    "the energy dispersion along the @xmath71 line of the brillouin zone is shown , exhibiting the same behavior as in the case of a quantum well.@xcite we observe that conduction and valence bands are very similar in both cases . however , the bare layer has a band gap larger by 0.37 ev .",
    "the main difference is obviously the presence of surface states , located within the band gap .",
    "these states are grouped in two energy ranges .",
    "the states @xmath72 ( index assigned in increasing order of energy ) , are closer to the valence band edge and have a flatter dispersion .",
    "the other group , formed by the states @xmath73 and @xmath74 , located in the middle of the band gap , have a more pronounced dispersion . on the contrary",
    ", the band structure of the passivated layer has no state within the band gap .",
    "this analysis is further clarified by examining the charge density in real space .",
    "figures  [ abo_layer](c ) and ( d ) show the plane - averaged density corresponding to some relevant states of the bare and passivated @xmath68-layers , together with the plane - averaged self - consistent potential profile , along the @xmath69 $ ] direction .",
    "in the case of the bare layer , the mid - gap surface states @xmath73 and @xmath74 present different profiles having a strong hybridization with the layer atoms , penetrating appreciably inside the layer . for the state @xmath75",
    "the penetration into vacuum is significant for both , the passivate and the bare layers , which can be explained by the small electronic effective mass . in the case of the bare layer",
    ", the state @xmath75 develops a maximum at the surface of the layer , which is the signature of a hybridization with a surface state . on the other hand , the charge density of the valence band states seems to vanish at the surface without any sign of hybridization , in either the bare or the passivated layer .",
    "it is worth to mention that for larger passivated nanostructures the charge density at the border will be negligible .",
    "we can also conclude that the dangling bonds affect mainly the states of the conduction band .",
    "_ step 2 : determination of the screened hydrogen pseudopotential .",
    "_ we calculate the effective pseudopotential for the atom positions of the unpassivated slab using our semi - empirical pseudopotentials for ga and n , @xmath76 . we use the same fft grid as for the self - consistent potential for the passivated slab calculated in the previous step via lda , @xmath77 .",
    "the difference between the two sets of data @xmath78 represent the modification of the potential in response to the presence of the passivated surface .",
    "this includes the effects of the self - consistent charge redistribution around the surface ga and n atoms , as well as the additional hydrogen potential .",
    "the potential @xmath79 is therefore a potential that represents the entire modification of the total potential trough the introduction of a passivated surface .",
    "accordingly , we obtain a different passivant  hydrogen \" potential for a hydrogen atom attached to a ga atom and for a hydrogen atom attached to a n atom . to extract a spherically averaged atomic quantity from @xmath79 we calculate the center of potential ( akin a center of mass ) @xmath80 of a set of @xmath81 points enclosed within a sphere around the hydrogen atomic positions @xmath82 : @xmath83",
    "if the potential would be spherical and centered around @xmath82 then @xmath84 and @xmath82 would coincide . in our case ,",
    "the geometric potential center is slightly shifted from the atomic position and we solve the equation self - consistently until @xmath85 . for the value of @xmath86 we use a value of 1.0 a.u ..    our passivant pseudo - hydrogen pseudopotential is given by @xmath87 and is shown in fig .  [ fig : scattered ] , where we plot the discrete set of fft grid points as black circles .",
    "the position of the hydrogen atom @xmath82 has been determined from eq .",

    "the data points lie mainly on a curve , which shows that the potential is close to spherically symmetric . for larger radii ,",
    "the data points show significant scattering along the enegy axis , which is expected , since the potential at the surface will have some non - spherical character .",
    "we obtain good results when the data points are fitted by a yukawa potential : @xmath89    for the n ( ga ) passivant potential we determine @xmath90 = 1.864344 ( 2.012838 ) and @xmath91 = 3.7635 ( 4.060362 ) with @xmath92 = 0.80 a.u . for a potential in hartree units .    ) for a 15  thick gan film .",

    ".projections ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) of the upper vb nw states @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) , onto the bulk vb states at @xmath54 , ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath144 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the above study must be complemented with the analysis of the projections of the nw vb states onto the bulk states @xmath137 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , at the @xmath54 point , which will give us additional information about the symmetry of the states . in table .",
    "[ tabla ] we have summarized the values of the corresponding projections ( @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) , for the same set of states as in fig .",
    "[ evo ] . for the largest nanowire shown here ,",
    "the composition of the topmost state , which has envelope @xmath119 symmetry , is almost equally divided between the bulk states @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the next two vb states , @xmath101 and @xmath147 , of @xmath64-symmetry , clearly show a dominant contribution from bulk bands @xmath137 ( @xmath148 ) and @xmath138 ( @xmath149 ) , respectively .",
    "neither of these states has a significant contribution from the @xmath144-band .",
    "when the nanowire size is reduced to 3.7 nm , we observe that the two highest vb states have now dominant contributions from @xmath137- and @xmath138-bands , with @xmath64 symmetry , whereas the mixed @xmath137-@xmath138 state becomes now the third state , @xmath150 . if one further reduces the nw size to 2.6 nm and below , the mixed @xmath137-@xmath138 state now becomes @xmath151 , whereas the first three states show a high degree of @xmath137-@xmath138-@xmath144 mixing .",
    "thus , our detailed analysis of the nw wave functions as a function of size has allowed us to identify a state with @xmath119-type envelope symmetry which is essentially an equal - weight mixture of bulk bands @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in fig .",
    "[ vale ] we have traced a line connecting these states .",
    "the change in the symmetry of the highest vb state as a function of size is just one of the consequences of the nontrivial interplay between symmetry mixing , spin - orbit coupling and confinement effects on the nw valence band electronic structure .",
    "this is in contrast to the simpler situation of the cb electronic structure .",
    "this unconventional trend of the nanowire electronic structure has also been reported by calculations using the tight - binding method.@xcite moreover , studies in other wurtzite systems , as the one made in zno nanocrystals by s. baskoutas and g. bester @xcite shows also that the highest state of the valence band is characterized by a @xmath119-type envelope .",
    "we have followed the idea @xcite to use the screened effective potential from a dft bulk calculation to extract a spherically averaged atomic pseudopotential .",
    "we have derived the analytic connection between the screened dft effective potential and the atomic quantities in the case of wurtzite bulk unit cells .",
    "this allowed us to derive atomic semi - empirical pseudopotentials for nitride materials .",
    "the pseudopotentials are non - local , in the same way as dft norm - conserving pseudopotentials , and reproduce the dft results for the eigenvalues of bulk up to a few mev .",
    "our potentials are not aimed at the calculation of total energies but at the calculations of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions around the band gap , which gives some leverage on the reduction of the energy cut - off , compared to dft calculations . the advantage of the method compared to the original empirical pseudopotential approach ( see ref .",
    "and references therein ) resides in the direct link to ab - intio calculations and the ensuing rather simple fitting procedure of a curve through a dense set of data points .",
    "the transferability of the potentials are good for the situations studied here but are expected to degrade when charge transfer significantly deviates from the bulk situation .",
    "this represents a general limitation of the method that we , however , palliate for the case of a free surface by deriving effective passivant potentials ( see next paragraph ) .",
    "the defective band gap inherited from dft is correct by a slight adjustment of the non - local channel of the potential which has only a very marginal effect on the wave functions , as shown previously @xcite .",
    "the derived method should be applicable to other materials .",
    "eventually , the method can be built on the basis of gw calculations . however , full self - consistent gw calculations are still prohibitive in the applications to extended systems and only work for small molecules.@xcite    in the second part of this work , we have established a simple and direct methodology to obtain the passivating pseudo - hydrogen pseudopotentials , essential for the treatment of free surfaces in nanowires or nanoparticles .",
    "we thereby use the difference between the screened effective dft potentials of a passivated structure and the semiempirical pseudopotential of the corresponding unpassivated structure .",
    "the derivation is done in real space and we find that a cubic spline interpolation up to a cut - off radius @xmath92 , connected to a yukawa potential leads to satisfactory results .    the suitability of the semi - empirical pseudopotential method and of our passivation procedure has been explored in gan nanowires . due to the high confinement of nw sizes below 10 nm ,",
    "the use of accurate atomic potentials is unavoidable , as continuous methods are expected to fail in the description of such systems .",
    "we have found that , while the conduction band states follow a behavior compatible with the ema predictions , the valence band states exhibit a complex evolution as a function of the nw size .",
    "we find drastic variations in the character of the wave functions with the nw size , which will influence optical properties such as the polarization of the photoluminescence .",
