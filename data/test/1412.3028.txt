    "the possibility of low - mass ( usually : @xmath1  gev ) cold dark matter candidates is theoretically interesting ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and experimentally challenging ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental signature for direct detection generally reduces to detection of recoiling target atoms ( `` nuclear recoils '' ) , following a scattering event .",
    "recently , interest in dark matter coupling to electrons has also increased @xcite",
    ". however , the present work focuses on the former situation . for particles bound in a galactic dark matter halo , nuclear recoil energies are typically @xmath2(kev ) or less , due to the galactic escape velocity @xmath3 .",
    "the amount of electronic excitation produced by a recoiling atom is quenched by approximately @xmath4 or more relative to a recoiling electron of the same energy .",
    "arguably the best theoretical prediction of this quenching is given by lindhard _",
    "most measured values show good agreement in germanium and silicon , and decent agreement in argon and xenon .",
    "experiments such as cogent @xcite and cdmslite @xcite have performed optimized , dedicated searches for low mass dark matter .",
    "the latter uses the lindhard quenching model parameterization to reconstruct the nuclear recoil energy of events , while the former uses a slightly more optimistic variation of the basic model . in both cases it has been reasonably argued that data support the choice , and in both cases the energy threshold for nuclear recoils is @xmath0  kev .",
    "on the other hand , experiments such as xenon10 @xcite and damic @xcite have estimated their sensitivity to elastic dark matter scattering using an extrapolation of the lindhard quenching prediction to reconstruct the nuclear recoil energy .",
    "the necessity of this approach has arisen from to the combination of single ( or nearly single ) electron detection thresholds along with a complete lack of nuclear recoil quenching data for such small energies .",
    "the g2 experiments lz and supercdms snolab face a similar situation in projecting their sensitivity @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", it is anecdotally known that the validity of the lindhard model in any material is questionable at very low energies .",
    "this can probably be traced to the cautionary statement appearing in @xcite that `` at extremely low @xmath5-values is a reduced energy defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : epsilon ] ] , @xmath6 , the nuclear scattering and stopping becomes somewhat uncertain , because the thomas - fermi treatment is a crude approximation when the ion and the atom do not come close to each other . ''",
    "the basic problem , then , is that the requisite data for low energy nuclear recoils are sparse to nonexistent . with the exception of germanium , reconstructed energies smaller than a few kev",
    "must rely on a model . and",
    ", the most widely used model is most uncertain in this regime .",
    "this article will examine the sources of this uncertainty , undo a simple approximation of the original treatment , and obtain a new solution of the original model in the energy range of interest for low - mass dark matter , i.e. @xmath6 ( generally , @xmath7 less than a few kev ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to begin with a very brief summary of the `` admittedly elaborate '' original treatment @xcite .",
    "the discussion in this section gives a broad - brush picture of the steps leading to the result known to the dark matter direct detection community as the lindhard model .",
    "it owes much to @xcite , however , the notation follows that of @xcite .",
    "most formulae and their derivations are intentionally left to the references .    for a recoiling atom of energy e",
    ", what portion @xmath8 of the total energy loss is given to electrons ?",
    "the remainder of the energy loss @xmath9 is assumed to be given to atomic motion , viz . @xmath10 . unless phonon energy is measured",
    ", @xmath8 is an upper limit to the available signal in a particle detector . for simplicity ,",
    "fluctuations are treated separately and the model is written in terms of average quantities @xmath11 and @xmath12 . an additional simplification is obtained in the case that the projectile and target atoms have the same atomic and mass numbers . the present work therefore focuses on four materials which satisfy this criteria , and are of current interest to the direct detection of dark matter : germanium , silicon , xenon and argon .",
    "a recoiling atom of any appreciable energy will undergo a cascade of collisions in its slowing down .",
    "thus , for a given energy @xmath7 , the competition between electronic and nuclear cross sections _ at all smaller energies _ contribute to the partitioning between @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the energy @xmath7 . the average energy given to atomic motion is obtained by integrating over all possibilities .",
    "this physical picture is described by @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is a dimensionless reduced energy .",
    "the details of the other symbols in this equation are explained presently in sec .",
    "[ ss : nucl ] and sec .",
    "[ ss : elec ] .",
    "the three terms in curly braces refer to the energy of the target atom after a collision , the projectile atom before a collision and the projectile atom after a collision .",
    "four key approximations underpin this equation :    a.   ionized electrons do not produce recoil atoms of appreciable energy . b.   the atomic binding energy @xmath15 of electrons is negligible . c.   energy transfers to electrons are small relative to energy transfers to atoms .",
    "d.   the treatment of atomic and electronic collisions are separable .    of the four ,",
    "approximation ( b ) is the most obviously troubling in the limit of low energy recoils .",
    "the nuclear scattering is modeled as two - body scattering in a screened coulomb potential , @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 is a single atom thomas - fermi screening function with length scale @xmath18 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath19 is the bohr radius .",
    "the standard technique is to extend this screening function to a pair of atoms via a suitable scaling of @xmath20 .",
    "lindhard used @xmath21 , though other slightly different scalings have been argued .",
    "classical mechanics then allows a further simplification into that of a single particle moving under a central potential . which is of course broken by e.g. polarization of the medium .",
    "] this can be solved for the orbit equation for two - body central force scattering , which gives the scattering angle @xmath22 ( in center - of - mass coordinates ) in terms of the initial particle energy and the impact parameter .",
    "the nuclear stopping power @xmath23 is just the average energy transfer , integrating over all possible impact parameters .",
    "the trick realized by lindhard et al . was a change of variables , defining @xmath24 .",
    "the nuclear stopping is then defined by an integral over a function @xmath25 ( _ cf . _",
    "fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "to emphasize , what was previously a function of three variables ( @xmath22 , impact parameter and initial particle energy ) is now a function of a single variable , @xmath26 . considering that these simplifications lead to the first solutions of projectile range and energy loss within a single model",
    ", we can perhaps forgive the authors for referring to their results as the `` magic formula '' @xcite .",
    "the electronic stopping power @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a reduced range .",
    "velocity proportional stopping is a very generic prediction in most models of electronic stopping power .",
    "however , calculations of the slope @xmath30 vary by up to a factor @xmath31 or more @xcite . in this article ,",
    "i follow the calculation of @xcite ( unless noted otherwise ) , using @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass number of the material .",
    "[ eq : dedr ] has been clearly verified for the simplest case of antiproton stopping @xcite .",
    "when one looks at a wider array of electronic stopping power data for very slow heavy ions @xcite , it is clear that velocity proportionality is generally observed .",
    "a sticking point for the direct detection community is that most of these models treat atomic electrons as an electron gas .",
    "since our detector targets tend to be semiconductors or large band - gap insulators rather than metals , one might expect a deviation from velocity proportionality .",
    "interestingly , velocity proportionality is still observed @xcite in materials with large band gaps . however , a non - zero @xmath5-intercept ( in the sense of eq .",
    "[ eq : dedr ] ) seen in some data indicates the presence of a threshold velocity , below which the projectile suffers no electronic energy loss .    for point - like projectiles ,",
    "this threshold velocity is calculable from simple kinematic constraints @xcite . for atomic projectiles ,",
    "these arguments @xmath34 which were applied in @xcite @xmath34 are not applicable . yet",
    ", intuition suggests that the size of a material s band gap should directly affect the low - energy electronic response to nuclear recoils . within the context of the lindhard model",
    ", the connection lies in approximation ( b ) .    to emphasize , velocity proportional stopping is well established , but strict velocity proportional stopping in the sense of eq .",
    "[ eq : dedr ] , with an @xmath5-intercept of zero , is not well established .",

    "[ eq : nubar0 ] was first verified for the case of germanium .",
    "immediately , one must contend with the fact that lindhard et al .",
    "did not calculate @xmath25 for @xmath40 .",
    "the authors of @xcite showed that errors in the nuclear stopping potential can be reduced from @xmath41 to @xmath42 using a molire parameterization of the screening . for @xmath40",

    "note that the @xmath23 given therein may be transformed to the desired @xmath25 by differentiation of @xmath43 .",

    "while the srim code is widely used , its predictions at low energy do not agree particularly well with available data ( as shown in @xcite ) .",

    "<S> direct searches for low mass dark matter particles via scattering off target nuclei require detection of recoiling atoms with energies of @xmath0  kev or less . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of electronic excitation produced by such atoms is quenched relative to a recoiling electron of the same energy . </S>",
    "<S> the lindhard model of this quenching , as originally formulated , remains widely used after more than 50 years . </S>",
    "<S> the present work shows that for very small energies , a simplifying approximation of that model must be removed . </S>",
    "<S> implications for the sensitivity of direct detection experiments are discussed . </S>"
