    "efficient management of future beyond 3 g and 4 g networks is a major challenge for network operators @xcite .",
    "the wireless ecosystem is becoming more and more heterogeneous with co - existing / co - operating technologies and deployment scenarios ( i.e. macro , micro , pico and femto cell structures ) .",
    "fault management or troubleshooting is an important building block of network operation .",
    "troubleshooting comprises three functionalities : fault detection ( i.e. detecting failures or poor performance as soon as they occur ) ; fault diagnosis ( i.e. determining the cause of failure or of poor performance ) , and fault recovery or healing ( i.e. repairing the problem ) @xcite .",
    "+ the importance of efficient fault management has motivated the development of automated methods and tools for diagnosis and healing . in this work , the main focus is given to automated healing .",
    "it is supposed that a given cell with poor performance has been identified ( fault detection ) and the cause of the degraded performance has been diagnosed as a bad setting of a specific radio resource management ( rrm ) or a system parameter ( fault diagnosis )  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the automated healing process aims at locally optimizing the value of this parameter , taking into account the key performance indicators ( kpis ) of the faulty cell and those of its neighbours .",
    "in other words , the rrm parameter that is found as the fault cause by the diagnosis process is optimized by the automated healing module .",
    "+ local type of optimization or `` steered optimization '' has been studied in the literature , based on combinatorial optimization in conjunction with the interference matrix to tackle local problems detected in the network @xcite .",
    "this approach uses a network simulator and can be implemented as an advanced functionality of a cell planning tool .",
    "the focus of this paper is to develop an automated healing method based on measurements .",
    "more precisely , our aim is to conceive an automated healing method that uses statistical learning of measured data and constraint optimization .",
    "the method is denoted as statistical learning automated healing ( slah ) .",
    "the slah module can be located at the management plane , e.g. in the operation and maintenance centre ( omc ) where abundant data is available .",
    "the method is iterative with a time resolution of a day , and should therefore converge in a few iterations . to achieve this requirement , a statistical learning approach using logistic regression ( lr ) is proposed that extracts the functional relations between kpis and rrm parameters and comprises the _ statistical model_.",
    "it is noted that the data is noisy due to the random character of the traffic and of the radio channel , but also due to imprecisions of the measurements .",
    "after each iteration , the statistical model is updated using the additional data and its precision is improved .",
    "the model is then introduced into the optimization engine and is processed directly to derive the next rrm parameter .",
    "this approach has the merit of converging rapidly .",
    "the performance of the slah is evaulated on an interference mitigation use case , namely an inter - cell interference coordination ( icic ) problem in a lte network.the choice of this use case is motivated by the importance of interference mitigation in ofdma ( lte / wimax ) networks , since it allows to improve the system performance , and particularly , to reach the strict requirements for cell edge bit rates ( defined in b3 g and 4 g network standards , such as @xcite ) . in this context , icic is one of the efficient approaches to mitigate interference .",
    "interference mitigation techniques such as icic can considerably improve signal to interference plus noise ( sinr ) and hence bit rates , particularly at cell edge . as a result ,",
    "better network performance and user quality of service ( qos ) are achieved , including reduced file transfer time ( ftt ) , block call rate ( bcr ) and drop call rate ( dcr ) .",
    "different interference mitigation methods have been proposed for ofdma systems , such as fractional reuse and soft reuse schemes @xcite-@xcite . when different power allocation for the mobile users is associated with different portions of the frequency bandwidth",
    ", the frequency reuse is called a _ soft reuse _ scheme , and will be considered here in the context of automated healing . + the paper is organized as follows :",
    "section ii introduces the concept and the system model for the slah and explains its different building blocks .",
    "section iii describes the lte icic model that is used in the slah case study .",
    "the adaptation of the slah to heal the icic process is developed in section iv .",
    "numerical results are presented in section v followed by concluding remarks in section vi .",
    "it is assumed that the fault cause has been diagnosed as a specific rrm parameter ( such as handover / mobility , admission and congestion control thresholds ) whose value has degraded the performance of the enodeb ( enb ) .",
    "an example of such a case is presented in @xcite where the bad setting of the add / drop window of a nodeb in a umts system is diagnosed .",
    "the purpose of the slah is to iteratively optimize the value of this rrm parameter using local information from the enb and its neighbors .",
    "hence , the automated healing is a _ local optimization _ process .",
    "the slah block diagram is presented in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the system model comprises four blocks : + _ initialization block : _ the initialization block provides the initial rrm parameter to the faulty enb in the network / simulator block and to the statistical learning block .",
    "+ _ network / simulator block : _ the network / simulator block represents the real network or the network simulator .",
    "it measures ( case of real network ) or calculates ( case of network simulator ) a set of kpis of an enb and of its neighbors for each new rrm parameter introduced by the initialization or the optimization block .",
    "+ _ statistical learning block : _ the statistical learning block extracts the functional relations , known as the _ statistical model _ , between the kpis and the rrm parameter through logistic regression ( lr )  @xcite .",
    "lr fits the data into the functional form denoted as @xmath0 : @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath2 can describe saturation effects at its extremities as often encountered in kpis in communication networks .",
    "+ let @xmath3 denote the @xmath4 sample value of the @xmath5 dependent variable @xmath6 ( i.e. the @xmath5 kpi ) corresponding to the @xmath4 sample value @xmath7 of the explanatory variable @xmath8 ( i.e. the rrm parameter ) .",
    "lr models @xmath3 as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the linear predictor representing the contribution of the explanatory variable sample @xmath7 , and @xmath11 is the the residual error .",
    "the @xmath12s are the regression coefficients whose values have to be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation  @xcite .",
    "hence from  , the functional relation between @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 estimated by lr , and @xmath8 can be written as : @xmath15 \\label{eq : y_x_funrel}\\ ] ] + _ optimization block : _ the optimization block calculates the optimal rrm value using the current statistical model .",
    "it determines @xmath16 , i.e. , the value of the rrm parameter @xmath8 that minimizes a cost function of a set of kpis denoted as the _ optimization set _",
    "@xmath17 , subject to constraints on a second set of kpis denoted as the _ constraint set _ @xmath18 .",
    "considering that @xmath19 has the functional relation form as in  , the optimization problem can be formulated as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cost function and @xmath22 is the weight given to @xmath19 .",
    "+   + the automated healing process is iterative . at each iteration ,",
    "a new rrm parameter value is proposed ( by the initialization block during the initialization iterations and by the optimization block during the optimization iterations ) to update the rrm setting of the faulty enb in the network / simulator block .",
    "the performance of the faulty enb and of its neighbors with this new rrm value is assessed by the network / simulator block through a set of kpi values obtained at the end of the measurement period ( typically one day ) .",
    "thus , a data point comprising a rrm parameter value and the corresponding kpis is obtained . this data point together with the previously obtained data points are used by the statistical learning block to refine the statistical model which is then used by the optimization block to generate the rrm parameter value of the next iteration .",
    "thus , as the iterations progress , on the average , the model precision improves and is used by the optimization block to find a better value for the rrm parameter .",
    "the performance of the proposed automated healing method is evaluated on an icic scheme which uses soft - frequency reuse .",
    "consider a downlink icic scheme that combines two resource allocation mechanisms : physical resource block ( prb ) allocation to frequency subbands and coordinated power allocation . in the soft - reuse one scheme ,",
    "the total available bandwidth is reused in all the cells while the transmitted power for a portion of the bandwidth of a cell can be adapted to solve interference related qos problems .",
    "figure [ figure : figure2 ]        presents the power - frequency allocation model in a seven adjacent cell layout .",
    "the frequency band is divided into three disjoint subbands .",
    "one subband is allocated to mobiles with the worst signal quality and is denoted interchangeably as a _ protected band _ or as an _ edge band _ with transmit power @xmath23 . a user with poor radio conditions is often situated at the cell edge , but could also be closer to the base station and experience deep shadow fading .",
    "the remaining two frequency subbands are denoted as _ centre bands _ with transmit power reduced by a factor @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 .",
    "the interference produced by an enb to its neighbours can be controlled by the parameter @xmath24 of this enb .",
    "the main downlink interference in the system originates from enb transmissions on the centre band ( to centre cell users ) which interfere with neighboring cell edge users utilizing their edge ( protected ) band .",
    "when an enb strongly interferes with the users of its neighbours , the icic mechanism allows to reduce the transmission power for the centre band .",
    "+ resource block allocation is performed based on a priority scheme for accessing the protected subbands .",
    "a quality metric @xmath26 is calculated using pilot channel signal strengths as @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 stands for the serving enb of user @xmath29 , @xmath30 denotes the mean pilot power received by the user @xmath29 of a signal transmitted by the enb @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the noise power spectral density .",
    "@xmath26 is similar to the sinr with the difference that in the present icic scheme , the data channels used to calculate the sinr are subject to power control .",
    "the @xmath26 metric is calculated for all users which are then sorted according to this metric .",
    "users with the worst @xmath26 are allocated resources from the protected band and benefit from maximal transmission power of the enb .",
    "when the protected subband is full , the resource block allocation continues from the centre band .",
    "+ note that the soft - reuse icic scheme is characterized by two other parameters in addition to @xmath24 : 1 ) the number of prbs assigned to the center and edge bands ; 2 ) the threshold that determines the boundary between center and cell edge users . in this work , for reasons of simplicity , we deal only with one parameter .",
    "the proposed algorithm can easily be generalized to multiple rrm case , however with an increased complexity .",
    "the choice of the @xmath24 parameter is motivated by the simplicity in its implementation , which is carried out by a simple power control on a pre - defined set of subcarriers while the other two parameters require modifications of the prb scheduling strategy .",
    "nevertheless , the proposed algorithm is equally applicable to the other two parameters without any major alterations .",
    "this section describes the adaptation of the slah to interference mitigation in a lte network by locally optimizing the parameter @xmath24 of the interfering enbs .",
    "denote by @xmath33 ( @xmath34 standing for @xmath35 ) an enb with degraded performance .",
    "it is assumed that the cause of the degraded performance has been diagnosed and is related to excessive inter - cell interference which can be effectively mitigated by a soft - reuse icic scheme .",
    "the first tier neighbours of @xmath33 are denoted by @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the index set of the first - tier neighbours of @xmath33 .",
    "the specificity of the interference mitigation use case is the following : to heal @xmath33 , the parameters @xmath39 of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , are optimized , while @xmath40 of @xmath33 remains unchanged .",
    "+ we use the notion of _ coupling _ between @xmath36 and @xmath33 which is expressed in terms of the interference that @xmath36 produces on the users connected to @xmath33 and can be written in terms of the downlink interference matrix element @xmath41  @xcite . hence the bigger the @xmath41 , the stronger the coupling between the two enbs .",
    "note that the matrix element @xmath41 is equal to the time average of the sum of interferences perceived by the mobiles attached to @xmath33 and generated by downlink transmissions to the mobiles of @xmath36 .",
    "denote by @xmath28 , @xmath42 , the index of the enb which is the most coupled with @xmath33 , namely @xmath43 , @xmath37 . to reduce the complexity of the slah process",
    ", we propose to adjust the @xmath39 parameter according to the degree of coupling between @xmath36 and @xmath33 .",
    "hence , we define a functional relation between @xmath44 and @xmath39 that accounts for the coupling mentioned above : @xmath45 note that the smaller the coupling between @xmath36 and @xmath33 , the lesser the power reduction applied to @xmath36 . thus , by using  , only @xmath44 needs to be optimized instead of all the first tier @xmath39s .",
    "the self - healing process can be performed simultaneously on any number of enbs provided they are not direct neighbours .",
    "+ the slah aims at minimizing the ftt for @xmath33 and of its first - tier neighbours while verifying constraints on their bcrs ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) .",
    "we define the cost function for the optimization as follows : @xmath48 it is noted that @xmath49 is a function of @xmath39 and hence , via equation  , of @xmath44 .",
    "the weighting coefficients @xmath50 depend on the relative contribution of @xmath41 with respect to the sum on all enbs in @xmath38 and are given by : @xmath51 satisfying the condition @xmath52 .",
    "the optimization problem can now be formulated as follows : @xmath53 subject to @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is the threshold for @xmath46 above which communication quality is unacceptably poor .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 indicators in equations   and  , are given in the form of lr function   obtained using the lr .",
    "+ the slah can be further improved by introducing a generalized interference matrix element @xmath58 in equation   by introducing an additional kpi , namely the bcr : @xmath59 one can see that the higher the @xmath60 ( i.e. the normalized @xmath46 ) , the smaller the @xmath58 and consequently , the smaller the modification of @xmath39 .",
    "the significance of equation  ( [ eq : newint ] ) is that , in order to improve the performance of @xmath33 , the decrease made in @xmath39 due to @xmath41 is limited by the degradation in @xmath46 .",
    "note that the constant @xmath61 allows tuning the effect of @xmath60 .",
    "+ denote a @xmath62 @xmath63 as the vector @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 denotes the iteration index .",
