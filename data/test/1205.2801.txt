    "quantum simulation promises potential returns in understanding detailed quantum phenomenon of inaccessible quantum systems , from molecular structure to the behavior of high - temperature superconductors  @xcite . moreover , quantum simulations are conjectured to be less demanding than quantum computations by being less stringent on explicit gate operations or error correction  @xcite .    due to these reasons ,",
    "quantum simulation has led to many theoretical proposals  @xcite .",
    "recently , various quantum simulators based on different physical platforms are being constructed , such as atoms in optical lattices  @xcite , trapped ions  @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance systems  @xcite , superconducting circuits  @xcite , as well as single photons  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the seminal work of knill , laflamme and milburn  @xcite photons are proven to be a suitable system for efficient quantum computing and quantum simulation .",
    "precise single - photon manipulations and tunable measurement - induced two - photon interactions are the essential ingredients for photonic analog quantum simulation and have been demonstrated .",
    "in addition to high - level quantum control , such photonic quantum simulators can produce exotic entangled states which are important for understanding the many - body dynamics in quantum chemistry and solid - state physics  @xcite .",
    "photons barely interact with the environment , which makes them ideal for exploiting various quantum phenomena .",
    "but in contrast to ions or atoms in optical lattices where physical interactions can be easily implemented via coulomb interactions or feshbach resonances , photonic simulations require various preparation steps to achieve controllable effective interactions .",
    "first , instead of non - correlated particles , one creates entangled singlet pairs of photons from non - linear crystals and these are used as input states for quantum simulation . in the language of quantum information we would say that each photon brings half an ebit ( one half of the singlet ) of correlation .",
    "second , the non - correlated photons are overlapped at a tuneable directional coupler and measured in different output modes to introduce effective non - linearities that create the targeted many - body correlation .",
    "this is an effective interaction among the photons ( for detailed calculation see ref .",
    "note that the recently proposed universal quantum computation based on coherent photon conversion provides an alternative avenue for achieving photon - photon interaction  @xcite .",
    "in the case of the simulation of spin-1/2 particles the photon s polarization is ideally suited as horizontally - polarized states @xmath0 and vertically - polarized states @xmath1 representing for example , spin - up and spin - down states . moreover",
    ", the ability to prepare symmetric polarization - entangled states @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the anti - symmetric state @xmath4 enables the establishment of states with bosonic and fermionic character  @xcite .",
    "the latter shares the same quantum correlations as heisenberg - interacting spins or so - called valence bond states  @xcite .    the theoretical investigation of strongly - correlated spin systems has led to few exact theorems which in some cases are of importance for the quantum simulation of chemical and physical models . in the particular case of a nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic heisenberg - interacting spin system it was shown by marshall  @xcite that the ground state for n spins on a bipartite lattice has total spin zero ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this theorem and its extension  @xcite lead to the fact that the ground state must be built as a linear superposition of singlet spin states or valence bonds .",
    "this constraint , that forces the ground state s total spin to be zero , gives rise to various valence - bond configurations that are either localized or fluctuating as superposition of different singlet partitionings .",
    "localized configurations are typically referred to valence bond solids and delocalized valence - bond states correspond to frustrated quantum spin liquids or resonating valence - bond states  @xcite .",
    "recently , the photonic quantum simulation of a four spin-1/2 square lattice as an archetype system  @xcite showed that quantum monogamy  @xcite plays an important role in frustrated heisenberg spin systems .",

    "the central wavelength of the pump is at 808 nm .",
    "then we use a @xmath6-barium borate crystal ( bbo0 ) to up - convert the pump pulses to ultraviolet ( uv ) pulses via second harmonic generation . the up - converted uv pulses central wavelength is 404 nm with a power of 700 mw",
    ". then we clean the uv pulses with several dichroic mirrors ( dm ) .",
    "photons 1 and 2 are generated from a bbo crystal ( bbo1 ) via spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in a non - collinear type - ii phase matching configuration and in an polarization - entangled state after walk - off compensation  @xcite .",
    "photons 3 and 4 are generated from bbo2 in a collinear type - ii phase matching configuration and are separated by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "we guide photons 1 and 3 to a tunable directional coupler ( tdc ) and then detect them by avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) , which together enable the tunable measurement - induced photon - photon interactions to happen . the relative temporal delay between the photons",

    "the bosonic nature of the photons shows up when the input states are superimposed at the tdc such that a detection , even in principle , can not distinguish either of them .",
    "this leads to a superposition of double occupations on both outgoing modes and thus suppression of the coincidence detections , where one photon is detected in each output mode .",
    "the visibility of this hom dip is one when the tdc is set to have equal splitting of transmitted and reflected photons similar to a 50/50 beam splitter .",
    "as soon as the two input photons can be partially distinguished by unbalancing the splitting ratio the visibility decreases .",

    "while the previous quantum simulation characterized the pair - wise energy dynamics of heisenberg interactions that were directly extractable from measured coincidence counts , this experiment requires the reconstruction of the density matrices to obtain the concurrence values . in the experiment we tune the reflectivity of the tdc and",
    "hence vary the photon - photon interaction strength .",
    "various four - photon quantum states are tomographically measured and the density matrices of them are reconstructed  @xcite .",

    "all of a sudden the entanglement between another spin pair ( e.g. @xmath21 ) is born at the cost of the reduced concurrence @xmath19 , which vanishes as @xmath17 is further increased .",
