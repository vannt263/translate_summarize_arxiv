    "charged particles of a cosmic ray shower , mostly electrons , passing through the atmosphere lose energy by inelastic collisions with air molecules .",
    "a small fraction of the total deposited energy is emitted by molecular nitrogen as uv fluorescence radiation in the @xmath0  nm spectral range .",
    "the detection of this radiation provides a precise determination of the longitudinal profile allowing the reconstruction of the cosmic ray properties , in particular its energy .",
    "this technique  @xcite was first successfully used by the fly s eye experiment  @xcite and later by hires  @xcite .",
    "fluorescence telescopes are presently being employed by the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and the telescope array experiment  @xcite . on the other hand , the jem - euso project  @xcite and the s - euso free - flying satellite mission  @xcite",
    "are being designed for the detection of fluorescence traces of air showers viewing downward from the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the ratio between number of fluorescence photons and deposited energy , i.e. , the fluorescence yield @xmath1 , is a key calibration parameter determining the energy scale of the fluorescence telescopes .",
    "a number of absolute measurements of the fluorescence yield have been carried out in laboratory experiments in the last years .    at atmospheric pressure ,",
    "fluorescence emission in the spectral range of interest basically comes from the second positive ( 2p ) system of n@xmath2 and , to a much less extent , the first negative ( 1n ) system of n@xmath3 .",
    "each one results from the transition between two electronic states and consists of a set of molecular bands corresponding to different combinations of vibrational levels @xmath4-@xmath5 of the respective upper and lower states .",
    "excitation cross section of the 1n system decreases with energy in the @xmath6  ev range showing a very smooth growing behavior at larger energies . that of the 2p system peaks at about 15  ev decreasing strongly with an @xmath7 dependence .",
    "as a consequence , high - energy electrons themselves are very inefficient for the generation of air fluorescence .",
    "in fact , as is well known , fluorescence emission along the track of an energetic primary electron is mainly induced by low - energy secondary electrons ejected in successive ionization processes .",
    "the efficiency for fluorescence emission varies with the energy spectrum of these secondaries , which in principle depends on the primary energy .",
    "however , a theoretical calculation using a detailed monte carlo simulation  @xcite has demonstrated that the fluorescence yield is nearly constant for energies above a few kiloelectronvolts .",
    "this @xmath8-independent behavior of the fluorescence yield has been checked experimentally  @xcite .",
    "a number of experimental values of the absolute fluorescence yield are available in the literature .",
    "essentially , in these experiments a beam of electrons crosses a collision chamber filled with air at known conditions",
    ". however different techniques can be used .",
    "many authors  @xcite have used electrons from a source of @xmath9sr with energy around 1  mev .",
    "other absolute measurements have been performed with higher energy electrons from accelerators .",
    "the macfly collaboration  @xcite used the cern / sps - x5 test beam facility which delivers a pulsed electron beam of about 10@xmath10 electrons per spill ( 4.8  s duration ) every 16.8  s. measurements at 20 and 50  gev were carried out using this facility .",
    "the flash collaboration  @xcite used the final focus test beam facility at the stanford linear accelerator center which provided 28.5  gev electrons in 3  ps pulses of about 10@xmath11 electrons at a rate of 10  hz . the airfly collaboration is carrying out absolute measurements of the air - fluorescence yield using different accelerators .",
    "preliminary results obtained with 350  mev electrons at the beam test facility of the instituto nazionale di fisica nucleare have been presented in  @xcite .",
    "new measurements using a 120  gev proton beam from the meson beam test facility at fermilab were presented at the 6th afw  @xcite and very likely final results will be published soon .    in this work",
    "we will compare the absolute values reported by the above authors .",
    "in many occasions comparison can not be done directly .",
    "for instance , some authors measure single intense fluorescence bands while others detect the integrated fluorescence in a wide spectral range .",
    "comparison between these experimental results can be carried out if the relative intensities of the bands along the fluorescence spectrum are known .",
    "we will normalize all the results to the most intense fluorescence band at 337  nm using accurate experimental data in full agreement with theoretical intensity ratios proposed in  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some authors report their measurements in units of photons per electron and meter while others give directly the @xmath1 parameter in photons per unit deposited energy ( e.g. , photons / mev ) .",
    "the conversion factor between both magnitudes is the energy deposited per electron and unit path length .",
    "as it has been pointed out  @xcite , an accurate determination of the deposited energy requires discounting that corresponding to secondary electrons outside the field of view of the optical system used to detect the emitted fluorescence . to evaluate this effect",
    "we have carried out a mc simulation of the various experimental setups . when possible a dedicated simulation including geometrical details has been performed .",
    "also the effect of the spatial distribution of deposited energy on the optical efficiency of the experimental setup has been evaluated in some cases . as a result of this study absolute values of the fluorescence yield normalized to that of the 337  nm band at 293  k and 800  hpa in dry air",
    "will be shown with a discussion on possible corrections to be applied .",
    "a previous comparison at 1013  hpa for some of the above measurements has been published recently  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will update those results and extend the comparison to other experimental results .",
    "in the literature , several parameters have been used to measure the amount of fluorescence light induced by an electron moving in the atmosphere .",
    "a detailed description of the various magnitudes can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the number of photons emitted per electron and unit path length have been used extensively .",
    "we will name this parameter as @xmath12 and , for a band @xmath13 , it is proportional to the number of nitrogen molecules per unit volume @xmath14 and the reciprocal of the @xmath15 stern - volmer factor , accounting for the collisional de - excitation of the upper level @xmath4 , where @xmath16 is a characteristic pressure depending on the gas composition and temperature .",
    "if ignoring the contribution of secondary electrons , the proportionality constant would be the so - called optical cross section .    while most secondary electrons have low energy , and thus , short range at atmospheric pressure , a small number of high - energy secondaries can escape the observation region . as a consequence , in a laboratory experiment a fraction of the fluorescence light can not be detected .",
    "following the parametrization in  @xcite , an effective optical cross section @xmath17 can be defined in such a way that the total number of photons of the @xmath13 band detected under given experimental conditions ( including contributions from both primary and secondary electrons ) can be expressed as    @xmath18    the parameter @xmath17 depends on @xmath8 , @xmath19 and the geometrical features of the experimental setup .",
    "therefore , even for the same primary energy , the measured @xmath20 value depends on the particular experiment .",
    "in addition , the pressure dependence of @xmath20 as would be predicted by the stern - volmer law is distorted in a geometry - dependent way .",
    "a further pressure dependence arises from the vibrational relaxation of excited nitrogen induced by collisions with surrounding nitrogen molecules in the ground state  @xcite .",
    "the effect of vibrational relaxation is twofold .",
    "firstly , it contributes to the total quenching of a given level @xmath4 and thus is included in the stern - volmer factor  ( [ eq : varepsilon ] ) .",
    "secondly , vibrational relaxation of upper levels ( @xmath21 ) provides an additional excitation channel .",
    "although , in principle , this effect may lead to a departure from the stern - volmer law , significant deviations have not been appreciated experimentally for any n@xmath2 band in air  @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the 2p(0,0 ) band , for which detailed data on vibrational quenching are available  @xcite , a simple calculation shows that the only relevant effect of vibrational quenching is a variation of the resulting characteristic pressure respect to the one from pure electronic quenching  @xcite .",
    "the number of photons per unit energy deposited in the medium is a more appropriate parameter for use in fluorescence detectors of cosmic ray showers . following an already common usage",
    ", we will keep the term fluorescence yield to refer to this magnitude @xmath1 . for a given band , @xmath20 and @xmath22",
    "are related by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the energy deposited per primary electron and unit path length . in the above equation",
    ", both the emitted photons and the deposited energy should correspond to the same volume , which is defined by the field of view of the experimental detection system .",
    "note that a significant fraction of energy is deposited by secondary electrons which move away from the path of the primary electron .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that @xmath25 and @xmath24 are proportional , resulting @xmath22 to be given by    @xmath26    where the @xmath27 parameter is independent of the experimental conditions and represents the fluorescence yield at null pressure , i.e. , in the absence of quenching .",
    "while measurements of the fluorescence yield at atmospheric pressure by different authors show a reasonable agreement , the available data on the @xmath16 parameters show large discrepancies due to secondary electrons  @xcite . ] .",
    "therefore the extrapolation of the fluorescence yield to null pressure is unsafe , making the @xmath27 parameter unsuitable for our proposes . in this work",
    ", comparison will be thus performed using the fluorescence yields measured at given atmospheric conditions .",
    "the energy deposited by an electron per unit path length within a given volume can be expressed  @xcite as    @xmath28\\sigma_{\\rm ion}\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the density of air molecules and @xmath30 is the ionization cross section , including the density correction for high energies .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the average values of the energy deposited per ionization process within the observation volume by the primary electron itself and the secondaries , respectively . for electron energies above 410  ev , contribution from x - rays arising from k - shell ionization should be also added to the energy deposition  @xcite",
    ".    the @xmath31 parameter can be calculated from    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the average excitation energy and the ionization potential of the ionized molecule , respectively , both contributing to the energy deposition of the primary electron after an ionizing interaction . the first term in the right hand of the equation accounts for the contribution from direct excitations without ionization , being @xmath36 the average excitation energy of the molecule and @xmath37 the excitation cross section for a primary electron .",
    "the parameters involved in the above expressions are either available in the literature or can be inferred from molecular data , except for @xmath32 , which has to be calculated from a simulation of the secondary processes inside the observation volume .",
    "next we will describe a monte carlo algorithm to calculate both the energy deposited by secondary electrons and their contribution to the fluorescence emission for a simple geometry . in section  [ sec : detailed_simulation ] a more detailed simulation including the geometrical features of several experiments will be presented .      ignoring fine geometrical details ,",
    "the observation region of an experimental setup can be described by a sphere of radius @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , we will assume that primary electrons interact at its center from where secondaries are ejected and tracked until they escape the sphere or are stopped .",
    "a monte carlo algorithm for the calculation of both deposited energy and fluorescence emission in this simple geometry has been described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "next the main features and ingredients of the simulation will be outlined and some improvements described .",
    "the algorithm generates secondary electrons with energies distributed as given by the extended opal formula proposed in  @xcite , which depends on the input primary energy .",
    "each generated electron takes a step of random size with mean value @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the total cross section for the electron energy .",
    "after this step , the type of process is randomly chosen between elastic , excitation , ionization and bremsstrahlung , being their relative weights the corresponding cross sections . while there are no energy losses in elastic interactions , in excitation and ionization processes the electron is assumed to locally deposit @xmath36 and @xmath41 , respectively . in case of ionization ,",
    "the electron loses an additional amount of energy to generate a new secondary , whose energy is randomly calculated from the above - mentioned extended opal formula . with a probability corresponding to the cross section for k - shell ionization ,",
    "also a 410  ev x - ray can be generated at the interaction point , producing another ionization at a random distance of mean value given by the photon attenuation coefficient from  @xcite . in case of bremsstrahlung ,",
    "the energy loss is estimated as 3% of the electron energy and the produced photons are assumed to escape the sphere .",
    "if an excitation ( ionization ) process occurs , the amount of 2p ( 1n ) fluorescence light emitted is calculated from the ratio of the 2p ( 1n ) cross section to the total excitation ( ionization ) one .",
    "the direction of the electron after an interaction is calculated from an approximated differential cross section  @xcite .",
    "the stepped trajectory of each electron is so iteratively simulated until it escapes the sphere or its energy is below 11  ev ( i.e. , the threshold for fluorescence production ) , when the electron is considered to be stopped and deposits its remainder energy .",
    "new secondary electrons arising from ionization processes are added to the list of electrons to be simulated following the same procedure .",
    "input parameters in the algorithm are the energy of the primary electron , the density of air molecules ( or pressure at given temperature ) and the radius of the sphere . as a result of the simulation the value of @xmath32",
    "is obtained , and then , the total energy deposited per primary path length is calculated from expressions  ( [ eq : edep ] ) and  ( [ eq : e0dep ] ) .",
    "likewise , the @xmath42 parameter can be calculated from the average number of fluorescence photons emitted inside the sphere in the absence of quenching resulting from the simulation . as expected",
    ", both magnitudes turn out to be a function of the product @xmath43 , that is , proportional to the number of molecules that a secondary electron encounters in its way out of the sphere , and the quotient provides the @xmath27 parameter , which is basically independent of @xmath8 and @xmath43 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , our calculation of the fluorescence emission is subjected to a systematic uncertainty , that we estimate in about a 25% , due to the uncertainties in the various molecular parameters .",
    "however the evaluation of the energy deposited in the sphere is much more accurate .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath44 limit , for which no secondary escapes , the predictions from the simulation are in perfect agreement with the bethe - bloch formula for the collisional energy loss  @xcite including the corresponding density correction .",
    "for this result , a crucial ingredient in the simulation is the energy distribution of secondary electrons .",
    "the extended opal formula proposed in  @xcite provides this spectrum for a very wide energy interval ( ev  -  gev ) of both primary and secondary electrons .",
    "simulation results of the deposited energy for several @xmath43 values have been presented in  @xcite . for the purpose of comparison , in figure  [ fig : edep_comparison ] the energy deposited by an electron per unit mass thickness , which is a factor of two lower than the mass number @xmath45 for both nitrogen and oxygen . ] in dry air at atmospheric pressure is represented against the primary energy for @xmath46  cm and 10  cm . below 0.5",
    "mev the fraction of energy deposited outside the sphere is negligible at this pressure and therefore the energy deposition for both @xmath38 values approaches the energy loss . as can be seen in the figure , the deposited energy is very weakly dependent on the size of the observation region at given pressure .",
    "for instance , the energy deposited by electrons of 1  mev ( 1  gev ) increases by 9% ( 6% ) when @xmath38 increases from 1 to 10  cm at atmospheric pressure .",
    "this justifies that a reasonable accuracy in the deposited energy can be achieved even though the fine geometrical details of the experimental setup are not taken into account .",
    "notice that in our algorithm , individual electron - molecule collisions as well as the emission of 1n and 2p fluorescence are simulated with a cutoff energy of 11  ev . on the contrary , usual mc codes",
    "( e.g. , geant and egs ) transports particles in macroscopic steps adding up the energy deposition in each step .",
    "fluorescence emission , which is mostly generated by electrons with energies of about a few tens of electronvolts , can not be calculated by these codes unless the user assumes a certain value of the fluorescence yield .",
    "the experimental determination of the fluorescence yield requires the calculation of the energy deposited in the observation volume .",
    "consequently , any possible error in the evaluation of this magnitude translates to the fluorescence yield .",
    "several experiments have provided results on their simulations which can be compared with our predictions for typical sizes of experimental setups ( see figure  [ fig : edep_comparison ] ) .",
    "cm and @xmath47  cm are shown ( solid lines ) for comparison with the energy deposition values reported by other authors ( symbols and broken lines ) .",
    "see text for details . ]    in their paper of 2006 the flash collaboration  @xcite showed results on deposited energy versus @xmath8 for a 1  cm thick slab of air at atmospheric pressure obtained with geant3 , which are significantly larger than our predictions for @xmath46  cm . in a more recent paper",
    "@xcite , they obtained an energy deposition for 28.5  gev electrons crossing a 1.67  cm air gap using egs4 which is closer to ours . in next section a detailed comparison",
    "is shown .",
    "the macfly collaboration  @xcite , using geant4 , reported a @xmath24 curve obtained for a cylindrical chamber , 15  cm in diameter and 28.8  cm long .",
    "its results above 2  mev are in fair agreement with our predictions for a sphere of radius 10  cm at atmospheric pressure , except for the highest energies ( @xmath48  mev ) , where our values are up to 6% larger . at lower energies the values are oddly much larger than expected",
    "( see also the next section for more details ) .",
    "finally , the airfly collaboration , using geant4 , has provided us with the results of a dedicated simulation for our simple geometry ( sphere of radius 1  cm and primary electrons are forced to interact in its center )  @xcite , which are fully compatible with ours within statistical fluctuations .",
    "in this section , a simulation including the particular geometry for several experiments as well as the propagation of beam electrons will be presented . that allowed the calculation of the energy deposited in the corresponding observation volume .",
    "when possible , the average geometrical acceptance for fluorescence detection has been evaluated and compared with that assumed by the authors of the experiment . for that purpose , the solid angle subtended by the optical system s entrance pupil",
    "is averaged along the electron trajectories , weighting with the amount of light emitted at each point .",
    "note that the effect on the detection efficiency due to the spread of electrons in the interaction volume is presumably small , as it results from the average of a distribution with axial symmetry around the beam axis .",
    "that is , the enhanced fluorescence contribution from electrons approaching the fluorescence detector is nearly compensated by the reduced one from those moving in the opposite direction .",
    "in addition , in those cases where the electron - photon coincidence technique is used ( e.g. , with a radioactive source ) , the detection of beam electrons is required in the simulation , and thus , primaries not firing the detector are rejected .",
    "this may affect the energy spectrum of contributing electrons , and so , the determination of the deposited energy .",
    "we have performed this detailed simulation for the experiments of nagano  @xcite , airlight  @xcite , flash-2008  @xcite and macfly  @xcite .",
    "experiments of kakimoto  @xcite and lefeuvre  @xcite will be also discussed although a dedicated simulation was not carried out .      for nagano s",
    "setup  @xcite , we made a detailed simulation in order to determine the effect of several approximations applied in this experiment and then evaluate a correction to their results .",
    "the collisional chamber of this experiment is shown in figure  [ fig : nagano_chamber ] , where the geometry implemented in this work is emphasized .",
    "they used the electron - photon coincidence technique , so this feature has been also implemented in our simulation .",
    "electrons fire a scintillator at a distance of about 16  cm from the @xmath9sr source .",
    "however , only the 5  cm gap between the collimator and the scintillator enclosure is in the field of view of the photon detectors . in this setup",
    "the observation volume corresponds to the chamber volume excluding the collimation channel and the scintillator enclosure .",
    "sr source are beamed and detected by a scintillator counter . between the collimator and the scintillator enclosure",
    "there is a 5  cm gap in the field of view of the photon detectors .",
    "the thick contour represents the geometry implemented in our simulation .",
    "the energy deposition obtained from our simulation including these geometrical details is fully compatible with the prediction for a sphere of 5  cm radius ( circle ) . ]    as input to the simulation , we have used a truncated gaussian fit ( solid line in figure  [ fig : nagano_spectrum ] ) to the measured @xmath9sr spectrum of  @xcite , with mean energy of 0.85  mev , end point at about 2  mev and a threshold of 0.3  mev due to the material covering the radioactive source . according to our simulation",
    ", most beam electrons are scattered away at atmospheric pressure and so are not detected .",
    "this occurs preferably for low - energy primaries , and therefore the spectrum of contributing electrons is shifted to higher energies , with a mean value of 1.11  mev at atmospheric pressure ( see figure  [ fig : nagano_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the approximations made by nagano  are the following .",
    "firstly , they assumed that all the fluorescence light is emitted from the beam itself .",
    "however , as explained above , a non - negligible fraction of fluorescence is produced by secondary electrons at some distance , and thus , the average geometrical acceptance @xmath49 may be different from that which would be obtained if all the light were generated in the beam @xmath50 .",
    "secondly , they calculated the @xmath12 value assuming the photons are emitted in a length equal to the gap distance @xmath51  cm .",
    "however , due to the fluctuating trajectories of beam electrons , the mean path length @xmath52 should be somewhat larger . finally , for the calculation of the fluorescence yield from  ( [ eq : y ] )",
    ", they assumed that the energy deposited in the observation volume equals the collisional energy loss @xmath53 at 0.85  mev as given by the bethe - bloch formula .",
    "as discussed above , the deposited energy is expected to be smaller than the total energy loss .",
    "therefore , the fluorescence yield value @xmath54 reported by nagano  , should be corrected by three factors accounting for the above described approximations    @xmath55    from our detailed simulation , we have obtained the average geometrical acceptance relative to that assumed in  @xcite , that is , the @xmath56 ratio in the above expression . for this calculation ,",
    "we have taken into account that some regions in the observation volume are hidden to the optical system .",
    "we have found that this correction to the efficiency is very small , as expected , resulting @xmath49 to be about 1% lower than @xmath50 at atmospheric pressure .",
    "the correction is even smaller at lower pressure . on the other hand , according to our simulation , the mean path length of contributing electrons at atmospheric pressure is about 1% longer than the gap length .",
    "therefore , these small corrections happen to compensate each other in equation  ( [ eq : nagano ] ) for this experiment .",
    "in fact , the nagano s results on @xmath12 ( photons / meter ) turn out to be unaffected by these approximations .",
    "the main correction to the fluorescence yield in equation  ( [ eq : nagano ] ) arises from the approximation in the energy deposition . from our simulation",
    ", we have obtained the average energy deposited per electron and unit path length @xmath57 as the ratio between the integrated energy deposition and the total path length of beam electrons within the observation volume .",
    "simulation data were accumulated up to reach a statistical uncertainty of less than 1% in the @xmath58 value . as a result of this correction ,",
    "the fluorescence yield at atmospheric pressure from  @xcite should be increased by 7% .",
    "the result of the deposited energy from our simulation of the nagano s experiment is fully compatible with the predictions from the generic simulation for a simple geometry , assuming a sphere of radius @xmath59  cm ( see figure  [ fig : nagano_chamber ] ) and an electron energy of around 1  mev .",
    "as already mentioned , deposited energy is very weakly dependent on  @xmath38 . in addition , at these energies around the minimum of the bethe - bloch formula , the result is nearly independent of  @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , for experiments similar to that of nagano , the generic simulation may provide reliable results on the energy deposited in the observation volume .",
    "the experimental technique used in airlight  @xcite is similar to the one of nagano , but with a collisional chamber larger by about a factor of two .",
    "electrons from a @xmath9sr source are collimated to form a narrow beam of 5  mm diameter . between the collimator and the electron detector ( a scintillator of 4  cm diameter )",
    "there is a 10  cm gap within the field of view of seven photomultipliers . in  @xcite a detailed simulation of the experiment",
    "is carried out using geant4 , including electron scattering by elements of the chamber ( e.g. , collimator walls , scintillator ) .",
    "both beam electrons and secondary ones are thoroughly tracked allowing the authors the determination of the geometrical acceptance as well as the energy deposited in the observation volume .",
    "for this experiment we have carried out a simulation including primary propagation and the geometrical details of the setup .",
    "electron scattering by other elements of the chamber apart from air is not included .",
    "the aim of our simulation has been the calculation of the integrated energy deposition as a function of the electron energy to be compared with the results found by airlight .",
    "while at low pressure we have obtained results in fair agreement with those reported in  @xcite ( within 5% at 50  hpa ) , at atmospheric pressure our simulation predicts a larger energy deposition .",
    "for instance at 800  hpa , deviations range from about 5% at low electron energy up to 20% at 2000  kev ( see figure  [ fig : airlight ] ) .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is still unclear .",
    "it should be indicated that electron scattering by components of the collision chamber ( included in their simulation , but not in ours ) would result indeed in an increase of the energy deposition , as pointed out in  @xcite .        from our simulation",
    "we have also calculated the integrated value of the collisional energy loss . at atmospheric pressure",
    "we obtain results somewhat larger than those reported by  @xcite , in particular at low electron energy ( see figure  [ fig : airlight ] ) . the energy loss computed by airlight seems to have been calculated as the product of the bethe - bloch stopping power @xmath53  @xcite times the 10  cm gap length , and thus , assuming that the stopping power is constant along the electron path .",
    "however , as already mentioned for nagano s experiment , due to the fluctuating trajectories of primaries , their mean path length is expected to be somewhat larger than the gap length .",
    "also , at low electron energy , the average stopping power should be larger than the initial value , because primaries lose a significant fraction of their energy in their path .",
    "obviously , the energy deposition must be smaller than the energy loss , and their difference is expected to diminish at low @xmath8 values .",
    "this behavior is found in our simulation as well as in that of  @xcite .",
    "however , at 800  hpa , the energy loss from  @xcite is smaller than our prediction of the energy deposition for electron energies below 400  kev ( figure  [ fig : airlight ] ) showing an evident inconsistency between both calculations .    assuming a mean electron energy of 1  mev",
    ", our detailed simulation predicts an average deposited energy around 10% higher than that of  @xcite at 800  hpa , and thus , if our results were correct , their fluorescence yield value at this pressure should be reduced in principle by the same factor .",
    "however , airlight reports @xmath27 results ( together with a set of quenching parameters ) by averaging measurements carried out at several pressures . ] .",
    "in fact the average @xmath27 values are nearly equal to those obtained at 400  hpa . at this pressure and an electron energy of 1  mev , the difference between our energy deposition and that of airlight is about 7% .",
    "therefore , according to our simulation , results on fluorescence yield from  @xcite should be reduced by an overall correction factor of 7% irrespective of pressure .      in this setup",
    "@xcite , an intense beam of 28.5  gev electrons from a linear accelerator crosses a cylindrical collision chamber , 25  cm in length and 15  cm in diameter .",
    "the beam is coaxial to a pair of 1.6  cm diameter cylinders with a 1.67  cm gap between them , which defines the beam path length as seen by two pmts .",
    "each detector is mounted at the end of a long channel perpendicular to the beam axis and provided with baffles to suppress unwanted scattered light .",
    "this channel terminates , at 45  cm from the beam , in a 1.2  cm diameter window that forms the entrance pupil of the optical system . in the opposite side",
    ", there is a shorter channel holding a led used to monitor the pmt gain stability , being the extreme of this channel at about 27  cm from the beam ( 72  cm from the window of the pmt ) .",
    "the absolute calibration of the optical system was carried out by comparison with the measurement of rayleigh - scattered light from a narrow beam of a nitrogen laser .",
    "as pointed out above , the flash collaboration used an egs4 simulation to obtain the mean energy deposited per electron in the observation volume of their experiment  @xcite .",
    "their simulation also provided the average geometrical acceptance for fluorescence detection relative to that for the calibration laser beam .",
    "we have carried out a detailed simulation of this experiment in order to evaluate the energy deposited in the chamber as well as the average geometrical acceptance for comparison with their results . in our algorithm ,",
    "the observation volume has been approximated by a rectangular prism of dimensions 1.60  @xmath60  @xmath61  cm .",
    "the deposited energy is not explicitly given in  @xcite , but it can be inferred from the ratio between the reported results on @xmath12 and @xmath1 at pressures ranging from 67 to 1013  hpa . in figure",
    "[ fig : flash_08 ] , the resulting values are shown as a function of pressure together with those from our detailed simulation , where statistical uncertainties were reduced to less than 0.3% . at high pressures ( @xmath62  hpa ) ,",
    "both results are in good agreement ( within 2% ) . however , the pressure dependency is different , resulting in a deviation of 6% at 67  hpa .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to a different treatment of the density correction , which at such a high electron energy is very important , lowering the inelastic cross sections by about 40% at atmospheric pressure . as a simple test",
    ", we have recalculated the deposited energy using in our simulation the density correction for 1013  hpa in the whole pressure range .",
    "the resulting energy deposition , also presented in figure  [ fig : flash_08 ] , shows a behavior similar to that of  @xcite .        in regard with the geometrical acceptance",
    ", flash  @xcite found that the efficiency of their optical system for fluorescence detection is @xmath63% lower than that for the calibration laser beam , due to the wide - spread energy deposition from the electron beam .",
    "however , our simulation predicts that this effect is negligible in the whole pressure range for this setup .",
    "notice that according to our simulation both corrections , i.e. , deposited energy and optical efficiency , nearly cancel and therefore the fluorescence yield at 1013  hpa from  @xcite would be almost unaffected ( see table  [ tab : comparison ] in section  [ sec : results ] ) .      in this experiment  @xcite ,",
    "the collision chamber is a cylinder 28.8  cm long and 15  cm in diameter with a mirrored inner surface in order to increase the geometrical acceptance .",
    "they used the coincidence technique , with individual electrons either from a linear accelerator ( 20 and 50  gev ) or from a @xmath9sr source of mean energy 1.5  mev .",
    "as mentioned above , macfly calculated the energy deposited per electron and per unit mass thickness as a function of @xmath8 using geant4 ( blue dotted line in figure  [ fig : edep_comparison ] ) .",
    "we have carried out a detailed simulation to obtain the energy deposition .",
    "primaries colliding the walls of the chamber or being stopped inside , and so not reaching the trigger system , are rejected in the simulation .",
    "the average energy deposited per electron and unit mass thickness has been obtained from the ratio between the integrated energy deposition and the total path length of triggering primaries .",
    "statistical uncertainties are reduced below 0.5% .",
    "the deposited energy obtained from our simulation is slightly lower ( 2% ) than the value reported by macfly at 1.5  mev and larger by about 6% at 20 and 50  gev , and therefore , according to our calculations the fluorescence yield of macfly should be increased by 2% at 1.5  mev and decreased by 6% at 20 and 50  gev .",
    "the above described detailed simulation is in good agreement ( better than 2% ) with the generic simulation for @xmath47  cm at energies above 0.5  mev ( see figure  [ fig : edep_comparison ] ) . below 0.5  mev ,",
    "primary electrons lose a significant fraction of their energy in the chamber ( e.g. , electrons with energy lower than 0.2  mev are fully stopped ) , and consequently the @xmath58 values resulting from our detailed simulation are somewhat larger ( @xmath64 ) than those obtained from the generic one .",
    "however this effect can not justify the very large discrepancies with the macfly results at low electron energy shown in figure  [ fig : edep_comparison ] .",
    "apart from those discussed in the above sections other well - know experiments have been carried out , in particular those of kakimoto  @xcite and lefeuvre  @xcite . for these",
    "we have not performed a detailed simulation but we will use the result of our generic simulation .    in the kakimoto s experiment electrons with a mean energy of 1.4  mev from a @xmath9sr source as well as those from an electron synchrotron with energies of 300 , 650 and 1000",
    "mev were used .",
    "fluorescence light was produced and observed in a 10  cm gap .",
    "for the determination of the fluorescence yield , they assumed full energy deposition in the beam axis . according to our generic simulation ,",
    "the deposited energy inside a sphere of 10  cm radius is about 6% , 25% , 28% and 29% lower than the energy loss for 1.4 , 300 , 650 and 1000  mev electrons , respectively .",
    "therefore , the fluorescence yield values at the above energies should be increased correspondingly by these factors .",
    "results obtained from applying these corrections to measurements of kakimoto  are consistent with those obtained in  @xcite using an alternative procedure .    in the experiment of lefeuvre",
    "@xcite , electrons with mean energies of 1.1  mev ( or 1.5  mev when applied a higher energy threshold to the electron detector ) from a very intense @xmath9sr source ( 370  mbq ) were used . in order to shield the fluorescence detector from the large amount of x - radiation produced at such a high electron rate , both the radioactive source and the scintillator counter were placed inside a solid lead cylinder , 10  cm in diameter .",
    "electrons trajectories were confined within a cone dug in the lead and coaxial to the cylinder , being the @xmath9sr source at the apex and the scintillator on the base .",
    "a 4  cm diameter hole was bored through the lead cylinder , allowing fluorescence to be measured from both sides . in order to obtain the average geometrical acceptance and the mean path length of electrons",
    ", they performed a geant monte carlo simulation including electron scattering by the lead walls .",
    "they found that this feature has an important role in this experiment , since half of primaries reach the scintillator after hitting the cone walls . from their simulation",
    ", they also found that a very small fraction of secondary electrons have enough energy to escape the observation region at atmospheric pressure .",
    "in particular , they obtained that only 1% of secondaries have energies above 5  kev , and 33% of them are lost in the lead before having produced any fluorescence . from these simulation results",
    ", they inferred that the deposited energy nearly equals the total energy loss and a minor correction of 0.4% was applied .",
    "however , as discussed above , a significant fraction of energy is deposited by these few energetic secondaries , and thus , the correction is expected to be larger .    from our generic simulation assuming a sphere of 4  cm radius for lefeuvre s experiment , we have obtained that the deposited energy is 9% and 10% lower than the total energy loss at mean electron energies of 1.1 and 1.5  mev , respectively .",
    "however , electron scattering by the lead shield of  @xcite is not included in our simulation , which assumes that secondaries reaching the walls are absorbed , and thus , it may underestimate the deposited energy in this case .",
    "we have evaluated this effect in order to estimate a correction to our simulation results for this experiment .",
    "using casino2.42  @xcite , we have found that , for a @xmath65 incident angle and energies in the 1  kev  -  1  mev range , about 60% of electrons are backscattered by lead , having lost almost half of their energy on the average . assuming that backscattered electrons deposit all their remainder energy in the air volume , about 30% of the energy of electrons reaching the lead walls is recovered , and thus , should be added to the total energy deposition . as a consequence , the fluorescence yield values at 1.1 and 1.5  mev from  @xcite",
    "should be increased by about 7% according to our calculations .",
    "the wavelength normalization can be carried out if the relative intensities of the molecular bands within the experimental interval are known .",
    "as is well known , relative intensities of bands sharing the same upper level are given by the relative einstein coefficients @xmath66 .",
    "as described below fluorescence intensities of bands with different upper levels can be also calculated from molecular parameters .    in the absence of other population mechanisms , the effect of vibrational relaxation of the 2p upper levels",
    "can be considered as included in the @xmath67 quenching parameters . ] apart from direct excitation of the vibrational level @xmath4 from the ground state  x , the band intensities of a given system are proportional to the excitation cross sections of the corresponding upper levels . at high electron energy ( i.e. , in the born - bethe high - energy limit ) , these cross sections are known to be approximately proportional to the franck - condon factors @xmath68 , which correspond to the probability ratios for optical transitions .",
    "it has been found  @xcite that this approximation can be also applied in our case , in spite of the fact that most fluorescence light is generated by low - energy secondaries . under this approximation , for a given band system , the relative intensities @xmath69 with respect to a reference one @xmath70 ( i.e. , the most intense band of the system , located at 337  nm for the 2p system and at 391  nm for the 1n system ) are given by    @xmath71    at atmospheric conditions , where @xmath72 can be assumed , the above expression becomes    @xmath73    where any pressure or temperature dependence is cancelled , since the same approximate @xmath74 growing behavior can be assumed for all @xmath16 parameters .",
    "relationship  ( [ eq : relative_intensities_limit ] ) , and hence the applicability of the franck - condon factors , has been verified using experimental data on relative intensities . in figure  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite we plotted the relative intensities measured by airfly  @xcite against @xmath75 for the 2p system , using the tabulated values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 from  @xcite and the experimental characteristic pressures for dry air reported in  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable linearity was found , in particular for the bands with upper vibrational level @xmath78 , contributing to almost 90% of the total 2p fluorescence .",
    "a similar analysis was previously performed in  @xcite using the relative intensities and @xmath16 values measured by nagano  @xcite .",
    "although linearity was also observed , significant fluctuations were found very likely due to much larger experimental uncertainties than those of  @xcite .",
    "expression  ( [ eq : relative_intensities_limit ] ) can be extended for molecular bands belonging to different systems including the ratio between the respective effective cross sections @xmath79 , defined as @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , whereas the franck - condon factors and the einstein coefficients are known very precisely , the available data on @xmath79 and @xmath16 are less reliable .",
    "effective cross sections depend on molecular parameters with significant uncertainties and are geometry dependent , and the available experimental data on characteristic pressures show large discrepancies . however , as already pointed out in  @xcite , the relative intensities measured by different authors , which are proportional to @xmath81 , are in good agreement . for instance , for the @xmath82 ratio at atmospheric pressure , values of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 result from data from  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "even a very consistent 3.5 value was measured by bunner  @xcite for 4  mev @xmath87-particles as well .",
    "therefore , the value of the @xmath88 products from experimental relative intensities is very reliable .    in order to compare absolute results on fluorescence yield from different authors",
    ", we will reduce values measured in a given wavelength interval @xmath89 to the yield at the 337  nm band .",
    "experimental results are then normalized multiplying by the ratio between the relative intensity of the 337  nm band and the sum of all the bands within @xmath89 .",
    "this @xmath90 ratio can be thus written in terms of the empirically reliable @xmath82 ratio as    @xmath91^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ]    where relative intensities at atmospheric conditions follow  ( [ eq : relative_intensities_limit ] ) separately for each band system .",
    "note that , due to the 2p dominance , even an error of a factor 2 in the @xmath82 ratio results in an uncertainty below 10% in @xmath90 for the spectral ranges of the experiments considered here .    for this wavelength reduction , we use accurate experimental relative intensities from  @xcite in the 284 - 429  nm spectral range , including some bands of the gaydon - herman ( gh ) system  @xcite ( 1.6% total contribution ) .",
    "for instance , for the whole wavelength interval of  @xcite a ratio @xmath92}=0.2569\\pm 0.0022 $ ] is obtained , where the uncertainties on the relative intensities are treated as uncorrelated as the authors suggest .",
    "note that this value is slightly lower than those listed in table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where intensities of bands of the gh system were neglected .",
    "in addition , equations  ( [ eq : relative_intensities_limit ] ) and  ( [ eq : ratio_337_interval ] ) allow the determination of @xmath90 for a wavelength interval including some of the 2p and 1n weak bands outside the spectral range of  @xcite .",
    "in table  [ tab : comparison ] absolute fluorescence yield values at atmospheric pressure reported by several authors ( first column ) are put in comparison .",
    "the wavelength interval , pressure , temperature and electron energy at which absolute values are reported are shown in columns  2  -  5 .",
    "the experimental results , in units of either photons / mev or photons / m , and the corresponding uncertainties provided by the authors are quoted in columns  6 and  7 . in order to get values normalized to that of the 337  nm band we have applied the procedure shown in section  [ sec : wavelength_interval ] .",
