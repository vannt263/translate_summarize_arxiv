    "the drell - yan process @xcite , the production of a lepton pair in hadron - hadron collisions , has played an important role in establishing the parton picture underlying the description of hard interactions in qcd . in current experiments , studies of the drell - yan cross section as a function of the invariant mass of the lepton pair",
    "are used to search for new heavy particles such as a hypothetical @xmath5 boson , while the differential distributions provide detailed information about the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , including in particular the sea - quark distributions .",
    "drell - yan production also serves as a prototype for other collider processes , such as higgs production or the production of new particles .",
    "a lot of effort has been put in obtaining accurate theoretical predictions for the drell - yan process in perturbative qcd .",
    "the calculation of the cross section and rapidity distribution at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath6 was accomplished in the pioneering work @xcite .",
    "the first next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) result for the cross section was presented in @xcite and confirmed much later in @xcite .",
    "the rapidity distribution at nnlo was derived in @xcite , while the fully differential cross section was obtained recently in @xcite .",
    "as the invariant mass @xmath7 of the lepton pair approaches the center - of - mass energy of the collision , there is less and less phase space available for the emission of qcd radiation .",
    "after the cancellation of virtual and real soft divergences large sudakov logarithms remain , because the scale associated with the soft radiation is much smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "these  threshold logarithms \" threaten the convergence of the perturbative expansion and need to be resummed to all orders .",
    "for the inclusive cross section @xmath8 this was accomplished in the seminal papers @xcite based on the solution of certain evolution equations in mellin moment space ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the generalization of this method to the drell - yan rapidity distribution was obtained in @xcite .",
    "recent analyses of threshold resummation for the rapidity distribution in drell - yan or electroweak gauge boson production can be found in @xcite in next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) approximation , while in @xcite the resummation is extended to the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( n@xmath9ll ) order .    because the pdfs are strongly suppressed in the endpoint region @xmath10 , the cross section @xmath8 is a steeply falling function as @xmath7 approaches the kinematical endpoint @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , in a typical experiment it will not be possible to observe drell - yan pairs with masses exceeding about one half of the center - of - mass energy . for instance , at the lhc one does not expect to discover new heavy particles with masses in the 10tev range . in practice ,",
    "one is therefore never in a region where the ratio @xmath12 approaches 1 .",
    "since threshold resummation deals with logarithms of the form @xmath13 , it is then not obvious why such terms should be treated on different footing than other higher - order terms . in view of this , it is surprising that large resummation effects were recently claimed to be important for the drell - yan rapidity distribution as measured by the e866/nusea collaboration @xcite .",
    "specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite claims that for @xmath14gev and @xmath15gev ( corresponding to @xmath16 ) the resummation of threshold logarithms at nnll order would lower the cross section by about 30% compared with the fixed - order nlo result , whereas the fixed - order nnlo corrections increase it by a small amount @xcite .",
    "however , significantly smaller resummation effects were found by other authors for lhc kinematics ( @xmath17gev and @xmath18tev ) @xcite and for @xmath19-boson production at rhic ( @xmath20gev and @xmath21gev ) @xcite . an argument why threshold resummation effects could be important even if @xmath22 has been given in refs .",
    "the idea is that the sharp fall - off of the parton luminosity at large @xmath0 dynamically enhances the contribution of the _ partonic _ threshold region @xmath23 , i.e. , the region where the center - of - mass energy @xmath24 of the initial - state partons is just sufficiently large to produce the drell - yan pair .",
    "it could then be important to resum logarithms of the form @xmath25 in the hard partonic cross section .",
    "however , since @xmath26 is not related to a small ratio of external physical scales , it is not obvious how to give a formal justification of this argument .    to study this question",
    "quantitatively and to assess the importance of resummation effects for the drell - yan rapidity distribution were the main motivations for the present work .",
    "to do so , we use a recent approach to sudakov resummation based on effective field theory @xcite .",
    "contrary to the standard treatment in mellin moment space , this framework completely separates the effects associated with different scales in the problem , thereby avoiding the landau - pole ambiguities inherent in the standard approach .",
    "it then uses renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution to resum logarithms of scale ratios .",
    "the resummation is performed directly in momentum space , which makes it simpler to compare to and match onto fixed - order calculations .",
    "our framework is particularly well suited to study the resummed rapidity distribution , for which we derive an exact analytic expression as a one - dimensional integral over pdfs .",
    "using the convergence properties of the perturbative expansion after scale separation as the primary criterion , we study in detail how and under which circumstances an effective physical scale @xmath27 emerges , which is associated with the soft emission in the process .",
    "our approach resums logarithms of the ratio @xmath28 to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows :    * in the true endpoint region @xmath29 , the effective soft scale @xmath30 is an order of magnitude smaller than the naive guess @xmath31 . for pdfs behaving like @xmath32 near @xmath10 , we find @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "this result provides a formal justification to the argument of a dynamical enhancement of the partonic threshold region due to the fall - off of parton densities . *",
    "the dynamical enhancement of the threshold contributions remains effective down to moderate values @xmath35 , while at very small @xmath36 values the parameter @xmath37 decreases to about 2 .",
    "this reflects the fact that for small @xmath0 values the fall - off of the pdfs is much weaker than for large @xmath0 . * even far away from the true threshold the drell - yan cross section receives its dominant contributions from those terms in the hard partonic cross section that are leading in the limit @xmath38 . assuming this is true for other processes as well , the evaluation of virtual corrections plus soft emissions provides a simple and efficient way to obtain useful approximations for higher - order perturbative corrections . * with the appropriate choice of the effective soft scale @xmath30 , the convergence of the perturbative expansion is greatly improved by the resummation .",
    "however , for small drell - yan masses the terms beyond @xmath39 in the resummed expression for the cross section are numerically unimportant .",
    "we thus do not confirm the large impact of threshold resummation on the drell - yan rapidity distribution reported in @xcite .",
    "for larger masses the effects can be significant .",
    "for instance , the experiment e866/nusea has reported data up to @xmath40gev ( corresponding to @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "we find that at @xmath42gev resummation effects enhance the fixed - order predictions for the cross section by about 25% at nlo , and 7% at nnlo .",
    "* for the case of the integrated cross - section @xmath8 , we perform a detailed comparison with the traditional resummation approach in moment space .",
    "similar to the case of deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) in the region @xmath10 , we find that the two approaches are equivalent up to power corrections , which turn out to be numerically small .",
    "an important conceptual difference is that in the effective - theory approach the running coupling is evaluated at physical short - distance scales depending only on the external variables @xmath43 and @xmath7 ( and perhaps the rapidity @xmath44 ) . in this way ,",
    "the landau - pole ambiguities inherent in the standard approach are avoided .",
    "we begin our analysis discussing the structure of the hard - scattering kernels relevant for the drell - yan rapidity distribution in fixed - order perturbative qcd . in section  [ sec : scet ] we use the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite to derive the standard factorization formula for the partonic cross section in the limit @xmath38 in terms of hard and soft functions , which we define in terms of wilson coefficients of operators in the effective theory .",
    "the solutions to the rg equations obeyed by these coefficients are derived in section  [ sec : resummation ] . with these results at hand ,",
    "we present exact analytic expressions for the resummed drell - yan cross section and rapidity distribution .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis of our results is presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] . after choosing the hard and soft matching scales in the effective theory by analyzing the perturbative expansions of the wilson coefficient functions , we investigate the stability of the results under scale variations and discuss the impact of the resummation . before concluding , we discuss the connection with the conventional moment - space approach",
    "we consider the production of a lepton pair with invariant mass @xmath7 in hadron - hadron collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath45 ( drell - yan process ) , focusing for simplicity on the reaction @xmath46 followed by @xmath47 .",
    "our goal is to calculate the double differential cross section in the variables @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath44 denotes the rapidity of the lepton pair in the center - of - mass frame . up to power corrections",
    "this cross section can be calculated in perturbative qcd and expressed in terms of convolutions of short - distance partonic cross sections with pdfs : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the probability of finding a parton @xmath52 with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 inside the hadron @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the factorization scale .",
    "the hard - scattering kernels @xmath55 have an expansion in powers of the strong coupling @xmath6 .",
    "the sum extends over all possible partonic channels contributing at a given order in this expansion . at leading order ( @xmath56 )",
    "only the channels @xmath57 contribute , while at nlo ( @xmath58 ) one must include @xmath59 in the sum",
    ".    it will be useful for our purposes to introduce the ratios @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the center - of - mass energy squared of the partonic subprocess that creates the lepton pair .",
    "this determines the maximum energy transferred to the leptons and the maximum invariant mass @xmath7 they can have . in @xcite the coefficient functions @xmath55 are expressed in terms of the variable @xmath62 and a second quantity @xmath63 these variables take values on the intervals @xmath64 and @xmath65 subject to the condition that the parton momentum fractions @xmath66 do not exceed 1 .",

    "higher - order terms beyond nnlo turn out to be negligible , so that it is unnecessary to resum them . to check whether the large effect seen in @xcite could be an artifact of the moment - space formalism ,",
    "we have applied our approach also in moment space and showed that it encompasses the traditional moment - space approach .",
    "we find that the two methods give compatible results , and that in both schemes resummation increases the cross section .",

    "if this is a more generic feature of hard cross sections , then threshold resummation techniques provide an efficient way to obtain the dominant part of the higher - order corrections .",
    "perhaps the most important outcome of our analysis is a quantitative understanding of the emergence of an effective physical scale characterizing the soft radiation in the drell - yan process .",
