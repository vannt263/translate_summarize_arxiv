    "we often encounter congestion of pedestrian flows and traffic flows in our daily life .",
    "we also observe the stuck of grains in granular flows .",
    "it is important to study the mechanism of congestion not only from the industrial point of view but also from the physical point of view . for the sake of scientific research ,",
    "we need to analyse a simple model which captures the essence of the phenomena .",
    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is one of the simple models adequate to describe such the transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "it is a stochastic system of particles moving asymmetrically on a lattice .",
    "the simplest limit of asep is that the particle is only allowed to hop in one direction , which is called the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) .",
    "it is known that the stationary state of one - lane asep under open boundary conditions has been obtained exactly @xcite .",
    "dynamical properties of tasep are also studied expensively .",
    "the exact solutions of the master equation by bethe ansatz on an infinite system @xcite and a periodic system @xcite have been obtained . furthermore , the current fluctuations in an infinite system and a semi - infinite system @xcite are also studied . in the open boundary system",
    ", we can draw a phase diagram by the parameters of inflow rate and outflow rate at the boundaries . on the phase boundary between the low density phase and the high density phase , there exists a diffusive domain wall ( kink ) @xcite . recently",
    ", takesue @xcite have derived a @xmath0 law in the power spectrum as a function of the frequency @xmath1 based on the random walk picture of the kink , and confirmed its quantitative validity from the comparison of the monte carlo simulation with their theoretical prediction .",
    "however we little know the properties of a multi - lane asep which is more realistic than the one - lane model .",
    "there are several two - lane models of asep @xcite .",
    "as used in @xcite or @xcite , a realistic lane change rule should refer to the states of the front sites .",
    "however , the rule makes us difficult to analyse because we need to construct a transfer matrix to refer to the states of three or four sites , which are the current site , the front site and the side site , or the front site of another lane .",
    "belitsky @xcite successfully analysed the long - time properties of such the two - lane model in an infinite system . here",
    ", we adopt a simpler model of lane change in which the particle may change lanes when the side site is vacant and do not refer to the front site .",
    "although the two - lane(channel ) model which adopts this simple rule is dealt by pronina @xcite who analysed the model based on a cluster approximation and compared the result with their extensive simulations , the lane change rates and the boundary parameters are symmetric in their model .",
    "we extend their model to the case of asymmetric lane change rule and boundary parameters to study a more general situations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the motion of kinks in a two - lane tasep . to fulfil the analysis ,",
    "we introduce our model and explain how to specify the position of the kink in the next section . in section 3 , we discuss the motion of two kinks based on a decoupling ( mean field ) approximation .",
    "we find that the motion of the kinks are synchronised though the number of particles in one lane is different from that in another lane .",
    "we compare the solution with the results of monte carlo simulation . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the validity of the mean field approximation .",
    "we find that the two - point correlation function is small during the relaxation process from the independent motion of two kinks to a synchronised motion of them . in section 5",
    ", we conclude our results .",
    "our two - lane model is defined on a two lane lattice of @xmath2 sites , where @xmath3 is the length of one lane .",
    "we introduce the occupation variable @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the occupied state and the vacant state on the @xmath7th site in the @xmath8th lane , respectively .",
    "the particle move forward by the rate @xmath9 during the time interval @xmath10 if the front site is vacant .",
    "we assume that all the particles drift from the left to the right .",
    "the open boundary condition is characterised by the inflow rate @xmath11 and the outflow rate @xmath12 .",
    "the particle is injected to the system by the rate @xmath11 when the first site in the @xmath8th lane is empty , while the particle is extracted from the system by the rate @xmath12 when the @xmath3th site in the @xmath8th lane is occupied . on all sites",
    ", the particle is allowed to change lanes only to the neighbouring site . a particle on the @xmath9st(@xmath13nd ) lane can change lanes by the rate @xmath14(@xmath15 ) when the side site in another lane is empty .",
    "we denote the probability of finding the system in the configuration @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "we write the time evolution of the two - lane model by the master equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is used for a dummy variable in the summation , and the transition matrices @xmath20 are represented as @xmath21 here the density function @xmath22 and two - point function @xmath23 are defined by , @xmath24 where the summation is taken over all the configurations .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath22 is written as @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where the current @xmath27 between site @xmath7 and @xmath28 is @xmath29 and the currents between lanes are @xmath30      it is known that a kink appears when the inflow rate is equal to the outflow rate and both rates are smaller than @xmath31 in one lane asep .",
    "the kinks also appear in the two - lane model when @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "it is obvious that the motion of one kink depends on another kink .",
    "we need to specify the position of the kinks in order to discuss their correlated motion .",
    "the position of a stable kink in the one - lane asep can be determined by using the second class particle @xcite .",
    "however , we adopt another method to determine the position of the kink by the whole number of particles in a lane . this definition has been used in the domain wall theory @xcite , and give the exact position of the kink when the inflow and outflow rates are small . the advantage to adopt this method is that it is much simpler than the method by the second class particle .",
    "we introduce @xmath36 for the whole number of particles in each lane @xmath37 we also introduce @xmath38 and @xmath39 by @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "the position of the kink @xmath42 is defined from the equation based on a kink picture ; @xmath43 where @xmath44 represent the density of the @xmath8th lane .",
    "the index @xmath45 represents the right side of the position of the kink and index @xmath46 represents the left side of the position of the kink .",
    "it is straightforward to give the eq.([n1 ] ) by summing up the equation @xmath47 from @xmath48 to @xmath3 , where @xmath49 is the step function , @xmath50 thus , once @xmath36 is known , we can determine the position of the kink .",
    "for the large system size @xmath3 , we can neglect the boundary terms .",
    "thus the equations for @xmath51 are given by @xmath52 when @xmath53 , the eq.([for ] ) is reduced to @xmath54 thus @xmath39 relaxes to @xmath55 exponentially , and the number of particles becomes identical in both lanes in the long time limit .",
    "however for @xmath56 , the problem becomes nontrivial because of the two - point function in the second term in the right hand side of the eq.([for ] ) .",
    "in general , the two - point correlation function is determined by an equation including three - point correlation function .",
    "thus , we can not obtain the exact form of the many - point correlation functions without truncation of the hierarchy of correlation functions . here",
    "we adopt the simplest truncation , which is the decoupling ( mean - field ) approximation as @xmath57 we also use the kink picture ( [ kin ] ) to approximate the density profile @xmath58 .    let us discuss the motion of two kinks starting from the initial condition where two separated kinks exist in both lanes .",
    "the density profile changes in time during the synchronisation of the kinks .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the density changes by keeping the density profile ( [ kin ] ) .",
    "thus we have to determine the time evolution of the density @xmath44 on the both sides of the kink . by introducing @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the time evolution equations for @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are respectively written as @xmath63 equations ( [ me ] ) and ( [ my ] ) can be solved exactly , @xmath64 where @xmath65 the initial conditions @xmath66 and @xmath67 are taken as the stationary densities in one - lane model as @xmath68    thus we obtain the density @xmath69 @xmath70 and the density @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 therefore we obtain the time evolution of the density profile @xmath74 for @xmath56 .    substituting eq.([kin ] ) into ( [ for ] ) with the aid of ( [ apr ] ) we obtain , @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 . equations ( [ asol ] ) and ( [ sol ] ) can be solved exactly , though the expression is lengthy ( see ( [ a4 ] ) and ( [ a5 ] ) ) . here , we present the solution for @xmath39 in the long time limit as , @xmath79 for @xmath78 , and @xmath80 for @xmath76 .",
    "these results show that there remains the mean difference of the number of particles between lanes .",
    "the validity of our analysis based on the decoupling approximation is confirmed by the comparison of our result with the monte carlo simulation when @xmath81 is not large .",

    "the initial condition is fixed to @xmath84 and averaged over 1000 samples . ]",
    "though @xmath39 remains finite , the positions of the kinks are synchronised .",
    "in fact , from eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) or ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ n1 ] ) we obtain , @xmath85 thus the positions of the kinks become identical in the long time limit .",
    "this result is reasonable , because we can not choose a preferable congestion front in traffic jams .",
    "now let us discuss the validity of the decoupling approximation .",
    "although it is difficult to evaluate the two - point function exactly , it is possible to evaluate it from the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the result of our simulation for the two - point function @xmath86 is shown in fig.3 for the same parameters as used in fig.2 , where we realise that @xmath87 is small between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the synchronisation is realised before @xmath88 as we can see in the fig.2 .",
    "thus , we may expect that the decoupling approximation adopted here works well to describe the synchronisation of the kinks .     from the simulation .",

    "the plus(@xmath45 ) stands for the first lane , the cross(@xmath82 ) stands for the density in the second lane and the approximation is shown by the solid line .",
    "the boundary parameters are @xmath91 . ]",
    "however there is a certain parameter region that the decoupling approximation fails .",
    "in fact , the left figure of fig.4 shows @xmath92 obtained from the simulation deviates from that in the decoupling approximation .",
    "the positions of the kinks are not identical in this case .",
    "the value @xmath87 given by the simulation in the right figure of fig.4 when it deviates from the decoupling approximation .",
    "the value @xmath87 is almost @xmath55 in the region between @xmath88 and @xmath93 .",
    "in such the region the stationary density @xmath44 is not given by the eq.([my ] ) .",
    "the comparison of @xmath69 between the result of the simulation and the solution of the eq.([my ] ) is shown in fig.5 .",
    "we can see that the density derived from the mean - field theory deviates from the result of the simulation .",
    "thus in the region that the final densities of each lane differ from the solutions of the eq.([my ] ) , the final positions of the kinks are not identical .    )",

    "the boundary parameters are @xmath95 . ]    to verify the valid region of the decoupling approximation , in fig.6 , we plot the deviation from the decoupling approximation in the difference between two kinks as a function of @xmath96 . from fig.6",
    "we find that the deviation is proportional to @xmath97 for the small asymmetric cases .",
    "this is an interesting result , because the decoupling approximation predicts @xmath98 .",
    "namely , the decoupling approximation can be used when we can regard @xmath99 as finite but @xmath100 as negligible .",
    "in addition , the curvature of the parabola is relatively small , which ensures that we may use the approximation in @xmath101 .",
    "the quantitative analysis of the violation of the decoupling approximation will be a future problem .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the motion of kinks in the two - lane tasep .",
    "we obtain the explicit time evolution function of the average number of particles in each lane which is related to the position of the kink by adopting the decoupling approximation of the two - point correlation function .",
    "we find that the positions of the kinks are synchronised , though the number of particles in a lane can be different from that in another lane .",
    "we confirm the validity of our analysis by comparing the result of the monte carlo simulation and the analytical result .",
