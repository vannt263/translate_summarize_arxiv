    "this work was triggered by skeptical remarks made by bohdan paczyski and helped by several technical discussions with micha chodorowski .",
    "for different reasons ( and using different arguments @xcite , @xcite ) they both advocated exploring if in the case of a flat cosmological 3d - space ( @xmath0 ) one needs to invoke space expansion since , they argued , the observed cosmological redshifts can be ( formally ) interpreted as a pure doppler effect due to motion of galaxies in a non - expanding flat space and no observation can distinguish this from space expansion . in this paper",
    "we show that such interpretation is not possible .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case of an universe with flat space sections i.e. with @xmath1 , but we will keep our discussion general , including also the cases @xmath2 .",
    "we are _ not _ using the @xmath3 convention here , so the light velocity @xmath4 appears in all formulae where it should .",
    "figures [ nexp ] and [ exp ] describe the source of the confusion .",
    "let us imagine two galaxies in the expanding universe .",
    "when the expansion progresses , the two galaxies are just further apart .",
    "the two figures seem to imply that in the case @xmath0 one can adopt two equivalent interpretations : ( a )  the space is expanding , ( b )  galaxies move relative to each other in a non - expanding flat space .",
    "the cosmological redshift in the case @xmath1 is therefore explained as the doppler effect .",
    "figures [ nexp2 ] and [ exp2 ] illustrate again the same two interpretations as shown in figures [ nexp ] and [ exp ] : galaxies in an expanding universe , and galaxies moving in a non - expanding space .",
    "this time , however , we show why the two interpretations are _ in reality _ physically very different .",
    "indeed , the case of expanding universe corresponds to a _ curved _ spacetime .",
    "the case of expanding galaxies corresponds to a flat ( minkowski ) spacetime .",
    "it is the spacetime curvature that makes the light trajectories _ physically different _ in the two cases .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that newtonian and general - relativistic cosmology of an isotropic and homogenous universe are equivalent only as long as one does not consider the propagation of light .",
    "figures [ nexp2 ] and [ exp2 ] suggest also that combined measurements of redshift and distance may together reveal the physical , observable difference between the two interpretations .",
    "note , that for these measurements it is sufficient to consider only radial motions of galaxies and light signals , and ignore angular @xmath5 and @xmath6 coordinates .",
    "this _ obviously _ means that the curvature of 3d  space is irrelevant to this problem .",
    "the radial part of the metric of the expanding universe may be written as , @xmath7 for simplicity , we will describe the dimensionless cosmological scale factor by a power - law function , @xmath8 where @xmath9 const is an arbitrary scale ; for example it could be @xmath10 .",
    "the only relevant riemann curvature tensor component , @xmath11 , of the two - dimensional metric ( [ metric - expanding ] ) with the scale factor ( [ scale - factor ] ) obeys @xcite , @xmath12 i.e. vanishes for @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in both cases , the spacetime ( [ metric - expanding ] ) must be therefore flat i.e. described by the two - dimensional minkowski metric .",
    "indeed , @xmath13 corresponds directly to the minkowski metric , @xmath15 while @xmath14 gives the milne metric , @xmath16 which , after the coordinate transformation @xmath17 takes the form @xmath18 , identical with the minkowski metric ( [ minkowski - metric ] ) .",
    "milne @xmath14 metric ( [ milne - metric ] ) and minkowski @xmath13 metric ( [ minkowski - metric ] ) are thus identical .",
    "however , from the @xmath19 3d  space point of view one can conclude that space is expanding .",
    "of course since in this case the 4d space - time is flat this is just an illusion . in the following",
    "we will show that this illusion is the source of confusion about the expansion of cosmological 3d  space .",
    "in a curved spacetime expansion is not illusory as it corresponds to physical observables .",
    "figures [ nexp2 ] and [ exp2 ] show the history of a radar measurements of the distance between two galaxies . at the spacetime event",
    "@xmath20 $ ] a light signal is sent by an observer in the galaxy located at @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 . at the spacetime event",
    "@xmath24 $ ] this signal is reflected from a distant galaxy located in @xmath21@xmath22@xmath25 , and returns to the observer at the spacetime event @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath27 $ ] coordinates in the metric ( [ metric - expanding ] ) are comoving with the galaxies , so that @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 for the first galaxy and @xmath21@xmath22@xmath25 for the second hold at all times .",
    "the observer continuously measures the pair of moments @xmath28 ( at which the signal is emitted ) and @xmath29 ( at which the signal returns ) constructing a function @xmath30 .",
    "he also continuously records the redshift @xmath31 of the other galaxy , and defines and continuously records the `` radar distance '' , @xmath32 in the remaining part of this article we will discuss these measurements and show , that from the knowledge of the three functions , @xmath30 , @xmath33 , and @xmath31 , the observer may definitely decide whether or not the space is expanding .",
    "we stress that the conclusion is based on the results of his gedanken experiment only , and is independent of the definition of 3d  space that he , or his colleagues , might adopt .     but with added radar measurement of distance .",
    "the light trajectories reveal _ different _ spacetime structure from that in fig .",
    "[ exp2](next page ) .",
    "obviously this difference will show up in simultaneous measurements of the redshift and distance .",
    "thus , measuring the redshift and distance , one can learn whether or not space is really expanding . ]     but with added radar measurement of distance .",

    "if space is not expanding , the redshift distance should be equal to the measured radar distance ( [ radar - distance - final ] ) .",

    "in this section we derive the form of the metric of milne s universe in a way that may be novel to some readers .",
    "the hubble law says that in the _ local _ universe the small redshift @xmath53 of a nearby galaxy is proportional to the galaxy distance , @xmath54 . for @xmath53 , one may use the non - relativistic formula @xmath55 and rewrite the hubble law as @xmath56 .",
    "let a galaxy located at a distance @xmath57 has its velocity @xmath58 . what would be the velocity of a galaxy at the distance @xmath59 ?",
    "the spacetime of the universe is described locally by the minkowski metric , where the answer is given by the special relativistic formula for adding velocities , @xmath60 integrating ( [ lorentz ] ) we get , @xmath61 and finally , @xmath62 the hubble constant @xmath63 may be only a function of time , @xmath64 .",
    "if the velocity is constant in time , the distance @xmath57 must obey @xmath65 . on the other hand , one knows that @xmath66 , with @xmath67 const being the comoving coordinate , and @xmath68 . from these conditions ,",
    "one concludes that @xmath69 , or @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , in this case , the metric takes the form @xmath71 we have arrived again at the milne metric .",
    "note that the velocity expressed in terms of the comoving coordinate takes the form that explicitly shows @xmath72const , @xmath73 which agrees with ( [ velocity - milne - limit ] ) .",
    "the milne spacetime is therefore the result of a particular globalization of the local minkowskian kinematics .",
    "one can also deduce ( [ lorentz - final - epsilon ] ) from the ( already mentioned ) transformation between the minkowski metric expressed in terms of @xmath74 and the equivalent milne s metric expressed in terms of @xmath75 , @xmath76 indeed , from the above equation , it follows directly that , @xmath77 the full , four dimensional version of the milne metric that follows from the full four dimensional minkowski @xmath78 $ ] after the coordinate transformation ( [ milne - minkowski - transformation ] , [ milne - minkowski - transformation - epsilon ] ) and @xmath79 , @xmath80 , has the form @xmath81.\\ ] ] the milne space @xmath29@xmath82const , @xmath83@xmath82@xmath23 has the metric @xmath84 and therefore corresponds to the case @xmath85@xmath86@xmath87 .",
