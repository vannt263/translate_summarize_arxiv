    "jastrow wavefunction  @xcite is a pair - product ansatz for a strongly correlated many - body bosonic ground state .",
    "exactly optimized form of the pair function can be found with the correlated basis functions ( cbf ) theory and the diagrammatic theory @xcite",
    ". however , such solutions are often either unknown or unavailable from open sources .",
    "meanwhile , the jastrow wavefunction is widely used as an approximation to the ground state in first - principles quantum many - body methods , both for bosons @xcite and as a part of a fermionic wavefunction @xcite .",
    "in particular , diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) requires such an approximation as its guiding ( importance - sampling ) function ; the path - integral ground state monte carlo ( pigs ) @xcite does not require importance sampling yet benefits greatly when a high - quality approximate ground state is used as its boundary condition @xcite .",
    "in such cases , the numerical efficiency and convenience of obtaining the trial functions is often important to practitioners .",
    "the pair factors of the jastrow ansatz , when used in the dmc , are often extracted by solving the pair scattering equation for small inter - particle separation , and only to the leading order .",
    "such a solution usually needs to be additionally parametrized with one or several variationally - optimized variables . in this work",
    ", we revisit this standard procedure .",
    "instead of parametrizing the leading - order solution to the pair equation , we parametrize the scattering equation itself .",
    "the trial functions are optimized in the space of solutions of such parametrized equations .",
    "we find that this results in a robust and straight - forward methodology which provides an excellent description of the ground state .",
    "we are considering a system of identical bosons with pairwise interaction potential .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath1 we assume the bijl - jastrow ansatz for the many - body ground state of this system , @xmath2 the kinetic energy of this function can be written as @xmath3 in a homogeneous system , the last term vanishes if one assumes that the three - body correlations are sufficiently weak , and the eigenvalue equation of hamiltonian ( [ eq : full - hamiltonian ] ) is fulfilled so long as factors @xmath4 satisfy the pair equation @xmath5 the energy @xmath6 is equal to @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the eigenenergy of the many - body ground state , and must in fact vanish for an infinite system .",
    "we retain this term as our calculations use finite periodic systems and @xmath6 can be used to satisfy corresponding boundary requirements .",
    "direct solutions of the pair scattering equation similar to ( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) were used by pahnparipande @xcite as part of a variational ansatz for nuclear matter . however , as we will see below , direct solutions of this equation are far from optimal for our systems of interest .",
    "it was realized early on that the dominant contribution to the quality of the pair factor comes from its behavior at small distances , where the potential energy diverges for a hard - core interaction .",
    "indeed , to this day solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) to the first leading order at short distances remains the standard prescription when a simple , few - parameter function is desired .",
    "this is often understood as solving the kato cusp condition @xcite for the divergence in @xmath9 , similar to the way one handles interactions such as _ e.g. _ electronic states in the coulomb potential or states in a finite - strength contact potential .",
    "such terminology is not strictly correct for the potentials with analytical hard - core part .",
    "in fact , at short distances , the optimal pair factors for hard - core interactions vanish exponentially faster than the divergence of corresponding potential or kinetic energy contributions .",
    "the expectation values for both the potential and kinetic energies exist and carry no irregularities .",
    "likewise , the wavefunction has well - defined derivatives everywhere where it does not vanish .",
    "this is the reason why the leading - order solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) can be additionally parametrized without forfeiting the variational principle . on the contrary , systems with true cusp condition",
    "must satisfy their cusp condition exactly in order to cancel non - analytic terms that arise in the schrdinger equationl ; such pair factors can not be meaningfully parametrized in the vicinity of the divergence .",
    "we write the pair factors in the positive - defined form as @xmath10 which is the conventional pseudopotential form but with the prefactor @xmath11 omitted for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the pair equation ( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) reads @xmath12 ^ 2 \\right ) + v(r ) = \\varepsilon , \\label{eq : pair - equation - u - start}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the physical dimensionality of the system .",
    "if the pair potential energy diverges at small distances as @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the other leading term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) is in fact @xmath16 and one has wkb - like solution @xmath17 and @xmath18 in practice , this solution does not yield an optimal energy but is in fact significantly improved by additional parametrization , @xmath19 where the constant @xmath20 can be determined by minimizing the variational energy . as mentioned above",
    ", such a parametrization is possible because every term of the pair equation ( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) remains analytical , and in fact even infinitely differentiable .",
    "indeed , @xmath21 moreover , the power of the divergence in @xmath22 can also be treated variationally for the same reason .",
    "the above approach alone allows to account for most of the correlation energy of the dense strongly correlated bosonic systems .",
    "numerous works have been devoted to improving the pair ansatz beyond the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : leading - term - u2 ] ) .",
    "one of the most studied systems in this regard is liquid helium-4 .",
    "this system has been the subject of about every quantum monte carlo method that is applicable , which included a large amount of work with explicit variational monte carlo with the jastrow ansatz .",
    "the simplest variational ansatz for helium consists of the parametrized leading - term solution proposed by mcmillan and by schiff and verlet @xcite , or similar solutions @xcite .",
    "the improvements beyond the leading order for helium can be seen as falling into the following categories : ( a ) addition to the leading term ( [ eq : leading - term - u2 ] ) of various explicit short- and long - range corrections derived from known general properties of the system @xcite , ( b ) parametrization of the mid - range behavior of @xmath22 focused primarily on improving the variational energy or structural properties @xcite , and ( c ) extracting the solution to the pair equation ( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) beyond the leading order , or using such solutions as a basis set @xcite .",
    "these approaches are considered in some detail below .",
    "additionally , one can use the pair functions obtained with paired phonon analysis ( ppa ) method @xcite .",
    "for instance , ppa optimization of campbell and pinski was used as a guiding function in ref .  .",
    "this method requires the hnc approximation and is out of our scope .",
    "the best forms of the jastrow function miss the ground state of liquid helium by about one degree kelvin per particle .",
    "a large part of this energy can be accounted for by including three - body correlations into the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "partially , the three - body correlations can be captured by the shadow wavefunction ( swf ) method @xcite which has since taken over explicit wavefunctions for the variational description of liquid helium .",
    "however , our interest is limited to the explicit jastrow pair terms .",
    "\\(a ) this approach relies on knowing the general properties of the static structure function of the system .",
    "it allows to recreate the physically important features that otherwise are missed by the leading - order solution .",
    "most remarkable of these corrections is the infinite - range tail in @xmath22 which must arise in the presence of zero - point phonons in the system @xcite .",
    "other corrections to @xmath22 were initially tied to the mid - range excitation structure of helium , that is , to the presence of the roton minimum @xcite .",
    "as the mid - range behavior is critical for achieving good varitational energy , parametrising @xmath22 in this region has a significant impact on the variational energy , disregarding the origin of such correction .",
    "overall , this approach leads to a rapid escalation of the parametrization of the pair factor .",
    "the leading order term must still be present , contributing one or two parameters .",
    "the phonon tail adds between one and two parameters ( speed of sound , and a distance cutoff @xmath23 ) , and at least three parameters are required for a simple gaussian mid - range correction ( its location , width and strength ) .",
    "\\(b ) if one is solely interested in minimizing the variational energy , or in replicating a known observable such as the pair distribution function , it is possible to this end to employ heavy parametrization of the pair function @xcite .",
    "such attempts have been quite successful , but in all cases relied on on using six and more parameters .",
    "here we are seeking approaches that are much straight - forward methodologically .",
    "\\(c ) trying to directly solve the pair scattering equations leads to the pair functions that are extremely poor in accounting for the correlation energy .",
    "moreover , as will be shown below , such energies depend very strongly on the size of the simulation cell .",
    "pandharipande and schmidt used the solutions of the pair equation as a variational anzatz for helium @xcite . a sharp cutoff allowed to limit the energy divergence , and the offset @xmath24 in ref .",
    ", used to satisfy boundary condition for @xmath4 at the cutoff , is equivalent to @xmath6 in ( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the energy in ref .   was extracted in an approximate way . a more productive approach , with excellent variational results ,",
    "was reported by vitiello and schmidt in .",
    "it was shown that when the pair equation is treated as an eignevalue problem , the set of lowest eigenfunctions can be used as a basis for expressing the pair function .",
    "that is , their approach uses the pair equation as a _ source _ of good variational functions . on the other hand ,",
    "the need to combine multiple eigenstates means one has once again to deal with as many as ten variational parameters .",
    "this work can be seen as extending the approach of pandharipande and schmidt .",
    "however , instead of parametrizing a linear combination of functions arising from the pair equation , we choose to parametrize the equation itself .",
    "the pair function is selected from the space of solutions of a modified and parametrized version of the differential eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) .",
    "straight - out solution of the pair eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) for any potential with an attractive part of the potential contains an exaggerated feature at mid - range separations .",
    "the larger is the simulation cutoff , the further is the solution cutoff , and the stronger becomes this peak .",
    "example solutions for helium are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : u2straight ] ) .",
    "we observed that this feature is especially sensitive to the presence of the second term on the l.h.s . of  eq .  ( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) .",
    "thus we considered several parametrized modifications of that term .",
    "with substitution @xmath25 and additional notation @xmath26 the pair equation reads @xmath27 which is nonlinear but can be solved numerically .",
    "the energy parameter @xmath28 is used to satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "below we list the parametrized equations which we consider .",
    "each equation contains one variational parameter , but may also be modified in that the `` dimensionality '' term is either switched in sign or removed altogether .",
    "for clarity of notation , each equation uses a uniquely named variable for its parametrization .",
    "* `` effective mass '' modifications , @xmath29 * prefactor to the quadratic term , @xmath30 * prefactor to the linear ( `` dimensionality '' ) term in @xmath31 , @xmath32 * suppression of the divergence of linear term at short distance , @xmath33 * suppression of the linear term at large distances , @xmath34 } v_2 - ( v_2)^2 + g_{\\varepsilon}&=0 \\label{eq : original-14 } , \\\\ -v'_2 + \\frac{d-1}{r/[1-(r / l_c)^{1/m_2 } ] } v_2 - ( v_2)^2 + g_{\\varepsilon}&=0 \\label{eq : original-15}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the terms are suppressed when approaching the cutoff distance @xmath35 . *",
    "finally , a prefactor in the first term , @xmath36      ) for varying cutoff lengths .",
    "the equation is solved for helium with the aziz hfd - b(he ) @xcite interparticle potential .",
    "the cutoff lengths correspond to cubic simulation cell with helium at its equilibrium density containing 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , and 1000 atoms . while the solutions coincide at small interparticle separations , the mid - range maximum increases with system size .",

    "we have revisited the long - posed question of producing satisfactory jastrow wavefunction based on the corresponding pair scattering equation .",
    "we proposed and considered in detail a straight - forward method for producing high - quality pair factors based solely on the two - body potential of the system .",
    "the method expands on the pair factors used some time ago by pandharipande .",
    "we propose two - parameter pair factors , in which one parameter modifies the pair equation , such as @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : original-9 ] ) or @xmath39 in eq .  ( [ eq : original-16 ] ) , and the second parameter is the solution cutoff .",
    "the modified equations preserve the leading - order solution of the pair equation at short distances .",
    "such a pair factor provides excellent variational optimization and reproduces the first peak of the pair - distribution function .",
    "it is possible to add known or desired long - range behavior to such pair factors .",
    "it should be concluded that not only it is possible to extract satisfactory pair factors from the pair scattering equation , but that such factors are of high - quality and may be of convenience due the low number of corresponding variational parameters .",
