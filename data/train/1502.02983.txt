    "the question on whether a formally hermitian operator is or it is not self adjoint has been completely solved by mathematicians decades ago .",
    "a very interesting presentation of this question from the physicists point of view is given in a paper by bonneau , faraut and valent @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the notion of self adjoint extensions of the one dimensional momentum operator @xmath2 and the one dimensional kinetic operator @xmath3 on the hilbert space of square integrable functions on a bounded interval ( we take @xmath4 and @xmath5 along this introduction and most of section 2 for simplicity .",
    "nevertheless , we shall reintroduce explicitly the mass in the final discussion ) .",
    "it is shown the existence of infinite self adjoint realizations of these operators each realization corresponding to one distinct self adjoint operator and therefore , according to the widely accepted interpretation , to one distinct quantum observable .",
    "the crucial point resides in the fact that both @xmath6 and @xmath3 belong to a special type of operators on hilbert space , the closed unbounded operators .",
    "most of observables ( position , momentum , components of the angular momentum , most of hamiltonians ) are represented by self adjoint unbounded operators .",
    "unbounded operators are not defined in general on the whole hilbert space @xmath7 , but on a dense subspace of @xmath7 , the _ domain _ of the operator . an unbounded operator @xmath8 on @xmath9 is determined by both its domain @xmath10 and the action of @xmath8 on each @xmath11 , which is @xmath12 .",
    "let us go back to the operator @xmath3 this time as an operator on the hilbert space @xmath13)$ ] .",
    "this operator can not be defined on the whole @xmath13)$ ] as we know the existence of functions on this space which either are not differentiable or do not have square integrable derivatives .",
    "in addition , even for domains such that both conditions are satisfied , @xmath14 may not be even hermitian , i.e. , @xmath15 for any pair of functions @xmath16 in the domain .",
    "furthermore , hermiticity does not imply self adjointness , when we deal with unbounded operators . in any case",
    ", @xmath14 has an infinite number of self adjoint determinations each one characterized by its own domain .",
    "the action of all these determinations on a given function always transform this function into minus its second derivative , but the spaces of functions on which they act are different .    in order to find the self adjoint determinations of @xmath14 one uses the theory of extensions extends the operator @xmath8 if @xmath17 and @xmath18 for all @xmath11 .",
    "then , we write @xmath19 . ] of hermitian operators .",
    "it is not our intention to give here a review of this theory . for a presentation comprehensible to physicists ,",
    "see @xcite .    for the infinite square well",
    ", we have chosen a point perturbation of the type @xmath1 , where @xmath20 is the dirac delta and @xmath21 its derivative in the distributional sense , on an infinite square well centered at the origin . in this case",
    ", the formal hamiltonian takes the form :    @xmath22    with    @xmath23    in consequence , the time independent schrdinger equation is    @xmath24    which is an equation on distributions .",
    "functions in the domain for which the hamiltonian in ( [ 3 ] ) is self adjoint can not be continuous and with continuous derivative at the origin @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to define the distributions resulting from the products of @xmath20 and @xmath21 times one function discontinuous at the origin . henceforth , we shall the following definitions :    @xmath25 & & f(x ) \\delta'(x)= \\frac{f(0-)+f(0+)}{2}\\,\\delta'(x)-\\frac{f'(0-)+f'(0+)}{2}\\,\\delta(x)\\,,\\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ,    @xmath26    same for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    concerning the derivative of the delta : it is not well known that the term in the form @xmath29 does not provide a unique perturbation of the hamiltonian @xmath30 . in fact , the introduction of the term @xmath29 often produces a certain degree of confusion . for instance",
    ", some authors say that if we add to a potential a term of this kind , then the potential is opaque , i.e. , no transmission coefficient exists .",
    "on the other hand , other authors find a non - zero transmission coefficient for @xmath1 .",
    "the reason of this disagreement lies on the use of different self adjoint extensions that provide different realizations for the perturbation @xmath29 .",
    "see @xcite . in this paper , we shall define a self adjoint realization of ( [ 1 ] ) having reasonable physical properties such as non - zero transmission and reflection coefficients through the @xmath1 barrier , as in @xcite .",
    "self adjoint extensions of the kinetic operator @xmath0 on the infinite square well have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "these self adjoint extensions are parameterized by five real numbers having one relation among them , so that only four are independent .",
    "this means that each of the self adjoint extensions of @xmath14 is characterized by the actual values of four real parameters .",
    "these parameters relate the boundary values of the wave functions and of their first derivatives as given at both walls of the well .    our hamiltonian @xmath31 in ( [ 1 ] )",
    "is given by a point perturbation added to @xmath14 depending on two real parameters .",
    "this perturbation is obtained by choosing a suitable self adjoint extension of @xmath14 . however , in this case , this self adjoint extension is determined by some matching conditions imposed to the wave functions at the origin .",
    "then , the question that we want to investigate here is how we could characterize this self adjoint extension using the parameters relating the boundary conditions at the wall as discussed in @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , this is not a trivial matter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce two possible parameterizations of self adjoint extensions of the kinetic operator in a finite interval , just the parameterizations we want to compare .",
    "section 3 contains the core of the present work .",
    "we use the results in @xcite to determine the parameters that produce the self adjoint determination of ( [ 1 ] ) that we are considering .",
    "the final conclusion shows that the relation between parameters is not one to one .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of a one dimensional free particle confined in the interval @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is given by ( [ 2 ] ) ,",
    "the infinite square well potential . along the present section",
    ", we shall usually take @xmath4 for simplicity , although we shall explicitly show the mass @xmath35 whenever convenient .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the issue here is the analysis of the differential operator @xmath0 , sometimes called the kinetic operator , on the interval @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "as is well known , this is an unbounded operator which is not completely determined until we define its domain , i.e. , the space of vectors on which it acts .",
    "the hilbert space of pure states for this interval is @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the domain of @xmath0 should be contained in the space of square integrable functions on @xmath32 $ ] which are twice differentiable ( almost elsewhere , i.e. with the possible exception of points in a set of zero lebesgue measure ) and such that their first and second derivative are also square integrable on the same interval . we shall call this space is the space of absolutely continuous functions in @xmath36 $ ] with first absolutely continuous derivative and such that @xmath37 . ]",
    "@xmath38 .",
    "now , the question is to find out the domains for which this operator is self adjoint .",
    "let us consider the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath38 .",
    "then , integration by parts gives :    @xmath41    in ( [ 7 ] ) , the star denotes complex conjugation .",
    "note that we demand the square integrability of the first derivatives of functions in @xmath38 in order to be able to integrate by parts .    obviously , @xmath0 on @xmath38 is not hermitian . by hermiticity ,",
    "we mean that @xmath42 for any pair of functions @xmath43 .",
    "we note that the necessary and sufficient condition for the hermiticity of @xmath0 is that    @xmath44    we need to choose a domain @xmath45 for @xmath0 with the obvious condition that @xmath46 , also fulfilling ( [ 8 ] ) . in order to define @xmath45",
    "one may choose all functions @xmath47 such that @xmath48 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath49 the space of the functions in @xmath38 with this property .",
    "any function @xmath50 and its first derivative are continuous at the well borders @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "clearly , @xmath0 is hermitian in @xmath49 .",
    "however , @xmath14 is not self adjoint . due to the hermiticity of @xmath14 , @xmath53 ,",
    "i.e. , the adjoint of @xmath14 , @xmath54 extends @xmath14 .",
    "one can easily prove that this extension is strict , so that @xmath55 and therefore @xmath14 can not be self adjoint .",
    "the search for self adjoint extensions of @xmath14 is nothing else that the search for domains @xmath56 for @xmath14 with the condition that any @xmath57 satisfies ( [ 8 ] ) without making use of the trivial condition @xmath58 .",
    "then , the domains of @xmath14 and @xmath54 will coincide and therefore @xmath59 .",
    "this problem has been solved and extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the domains that make the operator self adjoint are the spaces of functions @xmath60 $ ] such that    @xmath61      2c\\psi'(c)+i\\psi(c ) \\\\",

    "each set of fixed values of these parameters gives a self adjoint extension of @xmath0 .",
    "each of the self adjoint extensions is a different operator with purely discrete spectrum .",
    "as we have already remarked , there is another possibility , another characterization of the domains of the different self adjoint extensions of @xmath0 , which consists in fixing matching conditions at the origin in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "we would like to know how the correspondence between these two approaches are and particularly how the correspondence between the parameters that label the self adjoint extensions of @xmath14 looks like .",
    "in general , this seems a rather cumbersome task .",
    "we shall limit our analysis to the case of the extensions of @xmath14 producing the @xmath65 perturbation in the hamiltonian @xmath66 with @xmath34 as in ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this will give enough relevant information on how this kind of correspondence between the parameters defining the self adjoint determination ( extension ) in two different settings work .",
    "in addition , the problem in its full generality is not tractable .",
    "it is important to remark that two different self adjoint extensions of @xmath14 are different operators and have different eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "next let us make a brief excursion into the operator @xmath68 on @xmath69 .",
    "one possible domain , @xmath70 , for @xmath68 is the vector space of square functions in @xmath69 such that : i. ) admit a first and second derivative which are square integrable ( indeed it suffices that the derivative exists save for a null set , but we ignore here certain mathematical technicalities ) , ii . ) so that all functions @xmath39 in @xmath70 satisfy @xmath71 at the origin and iii . ) at the infinity we have @xmath72 . ] . here",

    "the interesting point is that we can define point potentials of the type @xmath1 by means of these self adjoint extensions @xcite .",

    "this systems looks to be hopeless , but it can be solved with a little effort .",
    "let us see how .",
    "first of all , it is obvious that ( [ 47 ] ) and ( [ 49 ] ) give    @xmath133    from equations ( [ 50 ] ) and ( [ 51 ] ) , we manage the elimination of @xmath134 . if we multiply ( [ 51 ] ) by @xmath135 , ( [ 50 ] ) by @xmath136 subtract and divide by @xmath137 , we obtain :    @xmath138}{k(1-m^2b^2)}\\ ; m_1\\,.\\ ] ]    now , take ( [ 56 ] ) and ( [ 54 ] ) , find their squares and sum .",
    "we obtain an expression from where it is simple to write @xmath139 in terms of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath131 .",

    "also , dividing ( [ 54 ] ) and ( [ 56 ] ) , we find :    @xmath143}\\,.\\ ] ]    it is noteworthy to say that , as we have eliminated @xmath134 from ( [ 50 ] ) and ( [ 51 ] ) , we could also have eliminated @xmath117 .",
    "we can do it by multiplying ( [ 51 ] ) by @xmath136 subtracting the result of multiplying ( [ 50 ] ) by @xmath135 and then dividing this result by @xmath137 .",
    "we obtain :    @xmath144}{k(1-m^2b^2)}m_1\\,,\\ ] ]    thus relating @xmath134 to @xmath139 .",
    "as we have already commented , relations @xmath118 are not independent but fulfil the relation @xmath145 .",
    "if we write @xmath134 and @xmath142 in terms of @xmath139 , we obtain :    @xmath146}{4ck^2(1-m^2b^2)}\\right]^2\\right .",
    "\\left[\\frac{2mb}{1-m^2b^2}\\right]^2 + 1\\right)m_1 ^ 2=1\\,.\\ ] ]    next , we use ( [ 57 ] ) in ( [ 61 ] ) . after some manipulations ,",
    "we obtain a simple transcendent equation for @xmath131 :    @xmath147    this equation can give us the energy values for given determinations of the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the variation of each of the first three energy levels with @xmath93 and @xmath94 for @xmath35 fixed is given in the figure 1 .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath94 , @xmath51 and @xmath35 are always positive and we have taken @xmath93 positive .",
    "the use of the mathematica tool called _ manipulate _ can give us the energy levels for different values of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath35 . in figure 1",
    ", we have chosen the values given for the parameters , although the figure is quite similar for another choices .",
    ", @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    the use of ( [ 62 ] ) greatly simplifies some of the above expressions .",
    "now , we can write the parameters @xmath139 and @xmath117 in terms of @xmath93 and @xmath94 :    @xmath151 ^ 2+\\frac{1}{k^2}[(4c^2k^2 - 1)ma]^2}}\\ ] ]    and    @xmath152    then , we have to analyze formulas ( [ 63 ] ) and ( [ 64 ] ) .",
    "one would have expected that the relation between the parameters @xmath118 and @xmath117 be one to one .",
    "then , take one self adjoint extension of @xmath14 characterized by the values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , i.e. , take specific values of these parameters in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we would have expected that these values give a unique pair of numbers for @xmath139 and @xmath117 . however , ( [ 63 ] ) and ( [ 64 ] ) depend also on @xmath131 and therefore on the energy levels .",
    "the conclusion is that the relation between parameters is not one to one , contrarily to what we may have expected .",
    "we have an apparent difficulty with formula ( [ 64 ] ) . if we use ( [ 62 ] ) in ( [ 64 ] ) , @xmath153 is simplified and we have an expression like :    @xmath154    for @xmath117 being fixed , this is a transcendental equation on @xmath131 . according to the inverse function theorem , one may at least locally , obtain a relation of the form @xmath155 .",
    "if we use this relation in ( [ 63 ] ) , we finally obtain something like @xmath156 , which is not a desired relation .    nevertheless , we have a cure for this problem and here is the correct treatment : from ( [ 62 ] ) and using the inverse function theorem , we can obtain local expressions of the type @xmath157 .",
    "we can use this in ( [ 63 ] ) and ( [ 64 ] ) so as to obtain local relations of the type :    @xmath158    this result is somehow unexpected as it shows that the relation between two different parameterizations of the self adjoint extensions of the kinetic operator on the infinite square well is not given by a unique function , but instead by a sequence of functions depending on the energy levels .",
    "this means that for each energy level , there is a distinct function that relates the values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 with those of @xmath139 and @xmath117 giving the same self adjoint extension and therefore the same set of energy values .",
    "being giving two specific values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 in ( [ 1 ] ) , the number of energy levels for the hamiltonian @xmath31 is infinite .",
    "this is a fact shared by any self adjoint extension of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "numerical estimations show that the largest deviations of the values for the energy values given @xmath159 , @xmath160 happens for the lowest levels , being negligible for high values of @xmath161 @xcite .",
    "then , for any value of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we give an infinite series of values for @xmath131 , say @xmath162 .",
    "for any value of @xmath162 , the function that relates @xmath93 and @xmath94 to @xmath139 and @xmath117 is different .",
    "the somehow surprising conclusion of the present paper is that the relations between different parameterizations of the self adjoint extensions of @xmath14 are not simple as they are not given by a unique equation as stated in the last section .",
