    "generally , stars have a tendency to form groups of different multiplicity , from the smallest possible ( binary systems ) up to large groups , like globular clusters with a population of the order of @xmath1 stars .",
    "observations give values for the frequency of multiple stars in the galactic field of up to @xmath2 ( kiseleva - eggleton @xmath3 eggleton 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "most of the multiple systems seem to be hierarchical ( e.g. tokovinin 1997 , kiseleva - eggleton @xmath3 eggleton 2001 ) .",
    "a hierarchical triple system consists of a binary system and a third body on a wider orbit .",
    "the motion of such a system can be pictured as the motion of two binaries : the binary itself ( inner binary ) and the binary which consists of the third body and the centre of mass of the inner binary ( outer binary ) . for most hierarchical triple stars ,",
    "the period ratio @xmath4 is of the order of 100 and these systems are probably very stable dynamically .",
    "however , there are systems with much smaller period ratios , like the system hd 109648 with @xmath5 ( jha et al .",
    "2000 ) , the @xmath6 tau system , with @xmath7 ( fekel @xmath3 tomkin 1982 ) and the ch cyg system with @xmath8 ( hinkle et al . 1993 ) .    when the inner pair of a hierarchical triple stellar system is a close binary system , i.e. the separation between the components is comparable to the radii of the bodies , the evolution of the inner binary can depend very sensitively on the separation of its components and this in turn is affected by the third body .",
    "thus , a slight change in the separation of the binary stars can cause drastic changes in processes such as tidal friction and dissipation , mass transfer , accretion and mass loss due to a stellar wind , which may result in changes in stellar structure and evolution .",
    "for instance , an eccentricity of only @xmath9 can be important in a semidetached binary ( kisela , eggleton @xmath3 mikkola 1998 ) .",
    "a comprehensive summary of those topics can be found in eggleton ( 2006 ) .    in a close binary ,",
    "the orbit is expected to become circular eventually , due to tidal friction .",
    "however this is not possible when the binary motion is affected by the perturbations of a third companion ( mazeh @xmath3 shaham 1979 , mazeh 2008 ) .",
    "eggleton and kiseleva ( 1996 ) , based on results from numerical integrations of coplanar , prograde and initially circular orbits of hierarchical triple systems , derived the following empirical formula for the mean inner eccentricity : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on the mass ratios .",
    "equation ( [ fegg ] ) was confirmed analytically by georgakarakos ( 2002 ) .",
    "moreover , the analytic derivation was generalized to hierarchical triple stellar systems with other orbital characteristics ( georgakarakos 2003 and 2004 ) .",
    "subsequently , some of the formulae were also tested for systems with planetary mass ratios ( georgakarakos 2006 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we deal with a problem that had to do with the secular part of our analytical solution and we manage to obtain a new formula which is free of that problem and gives improved results for certain cases .",
    "the new derivation applies to systems with initially circular and coplanar orbits , i.e. the type of systems we dealt with in georgakarakos ( 2002 ) .",
    "the new formula is tested numerically for systems with stellar and planetary mass ratios .",
    "other recent work on the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems includes the work done by krymolowski @xmath3 mazeh ( 1999 ) , ford , kozinsky @xmath3 rasio ( 2000 ) , blaes , lee @xmath3 socrates ( 2002 ) and lee @xmath3 peale ( 2003 ) .",
    "first , we would like to give a brief summary describing the derivation of the analytic formula ( for more details , one can check georgakarakos 2002 ) .",
    "our eccentricity expression consisted of two parts : a short period part , which varied on a time - scale comparable to the inner and outer orbital period , and a secular part .    in order to obtain the short period part of the inner eccentricity , and by using jacobian coordinates , we expanded the perturbing potential in terms of legendre polynomials and we then used the definition of the runge - lenz vector to obtain a series expansion for the inner eccentricity in powers of @xmath13 ( the period ratio x was considered to be rather large for the applications discussed ) .",
    "the secular part of the eccentricity was derived by using a hamiltonian which was averaged over the short period time - scales by means of the von zeipel method .",
    "then , by manipulating the canonical equations and by making a few approximations , we obtained our secular solution and eventually , we combined the short period and the secular solution in order to get a unified expression for the inner eccentricity ( we also had to find an expression for the outer eccentric vector , in order to determine the required initial conditions for the secular problem ) .    however , the secular solution was singular for certain combinations of the orbital elements and masses of some systems , and as a result , our model failed to describe the eccentricity evolution for those systems .",
    "the problem originated from the approximations we made about the motion of the outer pericentre , but with a more careful handling , that can now be corrected ( see subsection [ s3 ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that an important aspect of the theory that was developed , was the combination of the short period and secular terms in the expressions for the eccentricities . at any moment of the evolution of the system",
    ", we considered that the eccentricity ( inner or outer ) consisted of a short period and a long period ( secular ) component , i.e. @xmath14 ( one can picture this by recalling the expansion of the disturbing function in solar system dynamics , where the perturbing potential is given as a sum of an infinite number of cosines of various frequencies ) . thus",
    ", considering the eccentricity to be initially zero leads to @xmath15 ( initially ) , which implies that , although the eccentricity is initially zero , the short period and secular eccentricity may not be .",
    "we would like to point out here , that our derivation was done in the context of the gravitational non - relativistic three body problem with point masses .",
    "however , whenever it is necessary , it would be possible to generalize the calculation to include relativistic effects and the effect of treating the bodies as non - point masses , by adding the required terms ( e.g. a post - newtonian correction ) in the equation of motion of the inner binary .",
    "first , we list the components of both the inner and outer eccentric vectors ( short period ) .",
    "although the derivation details can be found in georgakarakos ( 2002 ) , the inner eccentric vector equations in that paper contain only the two dominant terms of the expansion , instead of the four we give below ( this is done for better accuracy purposes ; a four term expansion was used in georgakarakos 2003 and 2004 ) .",
    "the expansion of the outer eccentric vector includes one more term , compared to what we found in georgakarakos ( 2002 ) .",
    "that extra term improves the general solution of the problem , as it provides better initial conditions for the secular problem .",
    "the components of the inner eccentric vector are :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18    the components of the outer eccentric vector , which are obtained in a similar way to the one we used to get the components of the inner eccentric vector , are :    @xmath19+c_{\\rm e_{21}}\\label{e21}\\\\ e_{22}(t ) & = & y_{2}(t)+c_{\\rm e_{22}}=\\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{(m_{1}+m_{2})^{\\frac{4}{3}}m^{\\frac{2}{3}}}\\frac{1}{x^{\\frac{4}{3 } } } [ \\frac{3}{4}\\sin{(n_{2}t+\\phi)}+\\frac{1}{x } ( -\\frac{3}{16}\\sin{((2n_{1}-n_{2})t-\\phi)}+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{21}{16}\\cos{((2n_{1}-3n_{2})t-3\\phi)})]+c_{\\rm e_{22}}\\label{e22}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath20 is the total mass of the system , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mean motions of the inner and outer binary respectively , @xmath23 is the initial relative phase of the two binaries , i.e. the initial angle between the two jacobi vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and finally , @xmath26,@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are constants of integration .",
    "we would like to mention here , that when we expanded the components of the eccentric vector as a power series in terms of @xmath13 , terms of the same order as @xmath30 were missed out .",
    "those terms arose from the @xmath31 legendre polynomial in the expansion of the perturbing potential and they are of the form @xmath32 in the best case scenario , a rough estimate gives @xmath33 which leads us to conclude that the impact of the @xmath34 terms would not be significant for the parameter ranges discussed in this paper .",
    "this will be confirmed by numerical integrations in the subsequent sections .",
    "for that reason , and in order to avoid further increase of the volume of the equations , we choose not to include those terms here .      as in our previous papers , and in order to describe the long term motion of the system",
    ", we use a hamiltonian which is averaged over the inner and outer orbital periods by means of the von zeipel method .",
    "there are also other methods of studying the secular behaviour of hierarchical triple systems , e.g. see libert @xmath3 henrard ( 2005 ) , migaszewski @xmath3 gozdziewski ( 2008 ) , both concentrating on planetary systems . however , those methods can not reproduce fully the results of the von zeipel averaging method ( we are referring to terms that arise from the canonical transformation and which are second order in the strength of the perturbation ) . as a result ,",
    "the outcome is similar for planetary mass ratios , but for systems with comparable masses , the extra terms that the von zeipel method produces can have a noticeable effect ( e.g. see krymolowski and mazeh 1999 ) .",
    "the doubly averaged hamiltonian for coplanar orbits is ( marchal 1990 ) :    @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the subscripts s and t refer to the inner and outer long period orbit respectively , while @xmath36 is used to denote longitude of pericentre .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian is the keplerian energy of the inner binary , the second term is the keplerian energy of the outer binary , while the other three terms represent the interaction between the two binaries .",
    "the @xmath37 term comes from the @xmath38 legendre polynomial , the @xmath39 term comes from the @xmath40 legendre polynomial and the @xmath41 term arises from the canonical transformation .",
    "the expression for @xmath41 in marchal 1990 , contains just the term which is independent of the pericentres .",

    "generally , the new formula seems to work better and to provide more consistent results than the previous one . for most systems that show secular evolution , our model ( the averaged square eccentricity )",
    "has an error of about @xmath123 for @xmath104 , independently of the mass ratios of the system .",
    "there are a few systems with larger error ( e.g. for @xmath124 , but these systems are dominated by short period evolution ) and one with a small negative value ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 with @xmath127 error ) .",
    "this specific system looks a bit odd in table 1 , but if there were more systems in the table , the change in the error would look more smooth ( e.g. the error for a system with @xmath128 and @xmath129 is @xmath130 ) .",
    "basically , the error we get from the short period solution ( and which is the main source of the error in the final formula ) is passed to the secular solution by means of the initial conditions . as a result",
    ", our model has a longer period and some difference in the amplitude is also noticeable . as @xmath4 increases ,",
    "the period and amplitude differences go down and consequently the error goes down too .",
    "regarding the new secular solution we derived in subsection ( [ s3 ] ) , it appears that we have achieved our aim , i.e. to correct the problem that arose from the singularity @xmath52 in the old solution .",
    "for example , if one checks the corresponding table in georgakarakos ( 2006 ) , he sees that for @xmath114 and @xmath131 , the errors for @xmath122 are @xmath132 respectively . using our new formula ,",
    "the corresponding errors become @xmath133 .",
    "figures 3 demonstrate the improvement that is achieved by the use of our new formula .",
    "both column graphs are plots of inner eccentricity against time .",
    "the left column graphs are for a system with @xmath125 , @xmath134 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , while the parameter values for the right column graphs are @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath105 .",
    "the top graphs come from the numerical integration of the full equations of motion , the middle graphs are based on the old theoretical solution of georgakarakos ( 2002 ) and the bottom graphs are produced by our new equations .",
    "the improvement is clearly noted ( period and amplitude of oscillation ) .",
    "note that , although @xmath137 for the right column graphs , and one may expect not to have a significant error , the old equations fail badly .",
    "finally , we would like to mention here , that , after a more careful inspection of the systems in table 1 of georgakarakos ( 2006 ) , a few secular periods were corrected and some other systems that were not given a secular period , they now have one , as it can be seen in table 1 of this paper .",

    "an even distant or light companion is expected to inject eccentricity to a close binary .",
    "a slight change in the binary separation can have drastic consequences on its subsequent evolution .",
    "therefore , it is very useful to obtain analytical expressions about the amount of eccentricity injected into the binary orbit and the time - scales on which it is done .",
    "in addition , the analytical expressions could also be used for other purposes , such as the detection of a companion to a binary system ( mazeh and shaham 1979 ) , the determination of orbital elements of stellar triples or to set constrains to the masses and orbital elements of exoplanets .    in a series of papers , we derived formulae for estimating the inner eccentricity in hierarchical triple systems with various orbital characteristics and with the inner eccentricity being initially zero .",
    "the secular part of the solution we obtained in those papers , failed for certain combinations of the masses and the orbital parameters of some systems . in the current paper , we managed to obtain a secular solution for the inner eccentricity that had no such weakness .",
    "however the derivation applies only to hierarchical triple systems with initially circular outer binaries . for non - circular outer binaries ,",
    "the system of the approximate secular differential equations is non - linear and therefore we can not obtain an improved solution as we did for the circular case .",
    "the numerical integrations of the full equations of motion confirmed that our new model works well where the previous one failed to do so .",
    "our future aim is to see whether a similar solution can be obtained for the non - coplanar formula of georgakarakos ( 2004 ) .",
