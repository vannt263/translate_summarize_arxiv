    "we assume that the profile of the source and the statistical properties of the background are known .",
    "linear filtering of the data in order to eliminate partially the background is the primary goal .",
    "several filters have been introduced in the literature to deal with the problem .",
    "four examples are : the continuous ` mexican hat ' wavelet , difference of two gaussians , matched filters and scale - adaptive filters .",
    "the two first cases are filters given ` a priori ' , adapted to the detection of point sources , whereas the matched filter is constructed taking into account the profile and background in order to get the maximum snr at the source position . the scale - adaptive filter is constructed taking into account the previous properties and also the constrain to have a maximum in filtered space at the scale and source position .",
    "hereinafter , we will identify the position of the possible sources with the local maxima .",
    "the ` mexican hat ' wavelet used as a filter has been extensively applied during the last years to analyse optical , x - ray and microwave data .",
    "optical images of galaxy fields have been analysed to detect voids and high - density structures in the first cfa redshift survey slice ( slezak et al .",
    "microwave images have been analysed ( cayn et al .",

    "2001b ) to obtain catalogues of point sources from simulated maps at different frequencies that will be observed by the future planck mission . on the other hand ,",
    "the mexican hat has also been used to detect x - ray sources ( damiani et al .",
    "1997 ) and presently for the on - going xmm - newton mission ( valtchanov et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "other useful filters include the so - called ` matched ' filters .",
    "they optimize the signal - to - noise ratio and have been used mainly in signal processing .",
    "the generalization to two dimensions of the previous matched filters have been used recently to detect clusters of galaxies from optical imaging data ( postman et al .",
    "1996 ; kawasaki et al .",
    "1998 ) . in this approach",
    "the method uses galaxy positions , magnitudes ( and photometric / spectroscopic redshifts if available ) to find clusters and determine their redshift .",

    "2002a , b )    other remarkable filters that have been recently ( sanz et al . 2001 ) introduced in the astrophysics literature are the so - called scale - adaptive filters .",

    "one interesting question relative to all of these filters is the @xmath2 , that we define in terms of the following properties : confidence level of the detections , number of spurious sources which emerge in the process and number of real sources detected ( detection limit and completitude magnitude ) . as we will see in this paper , the previous properties are not only related to the snr gained in the filtering process but depend on the filtered momenta to 4th - order , the curvature of the source and the amplification in the 1d case . the combination of these quantities in a complicated way makes the decision on one filter totally dependent on the source profile and the background .",

    "( [ alfaybeta ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , let us consider a simulation with the same background , but without any source , and filter it in the same way as before .",
    "now , let us repeat the same procedure than before : we look for a local maximum at the central pixel of the ` image ' and , in case it exists , we apply the selection mechanism , that is , make the ( wrong ) hypothesis that a source of normalized amplitude @xmath44 is present in the simulation , and determine the region of acceptance as before .",
    "if the maximum is not inside the region of acceptance , it has been safely rejected . on the contrary , if it lies inside the region of acceptance , the noise will be interpreted as a signal and a false detection will occur . the number of false detections is directly related with the probability @xmath52 of eqn .",
    "( [ alfaybeta ] ) .    in order to test the behaviour of the probabilities of detecting a signal , rejecting a signal and obtaining a false detection as functions of the source amplitude @xmath181 and the filter , we tested 10 different values of @xmath181 . three different background regimes were tested : background index @xmath187 , corresponding to a case in which the mf is expected to detect with better reliability than the other two filters , @xmath150 , corresponding to a case in which the saf is the most reliable , and @xmath188 , where the most reliable filter is the mhw ( see section  [ sec : numerical ] ) . the lower and higher amplitude limits @xmath189 and @xmath190 were chosen so that after filtering with the saf the normalized amplitudes are @xmath191 and @xmath192 . for each value of @xmath181 we performed 10000 simulations containing a source in the central pixel and other 10000 simulations containing only background .",
    "each simulation was filtered using the saf , the mf and the mhw . for each pair of filtered simulations ( one with source and one without it )",
    "the following quantities were recorded : the number of times that a source was properly detected @xmath193 , the number of times a source produced a maximum but it was rejected by the selection criterion @xmath194 and the number of spurious detections ( due to the background ) that happened in the simulations without source , @xmath195 .",
    "the total number of maxima found when a source is present is @xmath196 .",
    "another interesting quantity is the ratio @xmath197 , that gives us an idea of the practical reliability of the detection .",
    "the results of the simulations with @xmath187 are shown in figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ] .",
    "the results of the simulations , indicated with points , are compared with the theoretical curves obtained in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "solid lines and filled circles make reference to the scale - adaptive filter .",
    "dotted lines and open circles make reference to the matched filter .",
    "dashed lines and asterisks make reference to the mexican hat wavelet .",
    "the first panel on the top and the left of figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ] shows the number of detections @xmath193 ( local maxima due to sources that are inside the region of acceptance ) in the 10000 simulations for the three filters .",
    "@xmath193 is directly related with the number density of maxima @xmath85 , being the relationship between the two quantities dependent on the sizes of the pixel and the filter scale @xmath24 .",
    "since the matched filter has the greatest gain , it gives the highest number of detections .",
    "the number of detections found in the simulations is lower than the expected value .",
    "this result is not unexpected due to the following reason : the theoretical expected number of detections is calculated by multiplying the number density of maxima in the presence of a local source @xmath85 by the number of simulations ( 10000 in this case ) and the pixel size ( in units of the filter width @xmath24 ) .",
    "this product can , eventually , give more than one theoretical detection per simulation and pixel , if the pixel size and @xmath44 are big enough .",
    "obviously , in a real simulation one can only find zero or one maxima per pixel .",
    "this effect is more conspicuous for high @xmath44 and , as we will see later , for higher @xmath121 values , producing apparent paradoxes such as the prediction , in some cases , of a number of detections greater than the number of simulations we have .",
    "therefore , the theoretical curve must be considered in the best case only as a upper limit for the real number of detections .",
    "the panel on the top and the right of figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ] shows the number of spurious detections @xmath195 found in the 10000 simulations versus the expected value .",
    "again , @xmath195 is directly proportional to the number density of maxima due to the background @xmath84 .",
    "the dots were obtained by counting the number of accepted background maxima considering all the pixels in absence of local source and then computing the average number of spurious detections per pixel , and the statistical @xmath198 error bars of such average .",
    "the agreement between the expected values and the results from the simulations is remarkable .",
    "the matched filter gives the lowest gross number of spurious detections .",
    "the left and the right lower panels in figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ] show the ratio between the number of background maxima interpreted as source ( @xmath195 ) and the total number of maxima due to the background , and the ratio between source detections ( @xmath193 ) and the total number of maxima in presence of a source ( @xmath196 ) , respectively .",
    "the first ratio gives us an estimation of the false alarm probability @xmath52 whereas the second one gives the power of the detection @xmath157 .",
    "the results obtained with the saf and the mf are strikingly similar to the expected values , whereas the concordance is slightly worse in the case of the mhw . note that the problem of the theoretical curves mentioned above does not affect these ratios because the terms that come from the number of simulations and the pixel area cancel in the division .",
    "more interesting is the ratio between the number of effective detections and the number of spurious ones .",
    "this quantity is shown in the middle panel on the left of figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ] .",
    "since the proportionality between @xmath193 and @xmath85 is the same than the one between @xmath195 and @xmath84 , this ratio is a good estimator of the ratio @xmath199 .",
    "the inverse of this ratio gives the percentage of spurious detections that is found in a number @xmath70 of detected maxima .",
    "again , the agreement between theory and simulations is excellent .",
    "note that the greatest values of @xmath197 correspond to the matched filter .",
    "that means that , if what we are looking for is _ reliability _ in the detection , the matched filter is the best choice in this case @xmath187 .",
    "in order to quantify the differences between filters regarding reliability ( in the sense mentioned above ) , it is useful the quantity @xmath158 defined in equation ( [ eq : d ] ) .",
    "this @xmath158 can be understood as the per cent relative difference between filters . in the middle panel on the right of figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ]",
    "it is shown the value of @xmath158 .",
    "the differences between the mf and the other filters are @xmath200 for the saf and @xmath201 for the mhw at intermediate @xmath44 values",
    ".    gaussian backgrounds with @xmath187 correspond to uncorrelated ( white ) noise and are very common in many fields of physics .",
    "for instance , the background of many astronomical images is dominated by uncorrelated poissonian noise , which is well approximated by this kind of noise when averaging over many observations .",
    "the results of the simulations with @xmath150 are shown in figure  [ fig : sd_gamma1p4 ] .",
    "as in the case before , the results from the simulations are compared with the theoretical curves obtained in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "the different lines and panels are the same as those in figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ] .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical expectations and the results is very good .        the number of detections @xmath193 at a given normalized amplitude @xmath44 is higher for the three filters than in the case @xmath187 .",
    "the filtering is more efficient at enhancing sources when @xmath121 increases due to the fact that at high @xmath121 the power of the background concentrates in large scale structures that are more easily removed by the filters .    in this case",
    "the performance of the three filters is similar in number of detections as well as in the probabilities @xmath52 and @xmath157 .",
    "the saf , however , produces a lower number of spurious detections due to the background .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath202 between authentic and spurious detections is better for the case of the saf ( although the mf performs almost as well in this aspect ) .",
    "the relative difference @xmath158 between saf and mf in this case takes values around @xmath203 .",
    "the mhw performs significantly worse than the other two filters in this case .",
    "we remark that noise index in the interval @xmath204 are not rare in some areas of astronomy .",
    "for example , in the scanning of the sky of many cmb experiments ( map , planck , etc ) backgrounds with noises in this range may appear due to the combination of cmb and galactic foregrounds with the scanning @xmath205 noise .",
    "the results of the simulations with @xmath188 are shown in figure  [ fig : sd_gamma2p2 ] .",
    "as in the two cases before , the results from the simulations are compared with the expectations obtained in section  [ sec : numerical ] .",
    "the different lines and panels are the same as those in figure  [ fig : sd_gamma0 ] .",
    "this case corresponds with the region in which the mhw outperforms the other two in reliability .",
    "the matched filter , however , performs almost as well as the mhw .",
    "the relative differences @xmath158 in the detection ratio are of a few percent between the mhw and the mf .",
    "the saf performs significantly worse in this case .",
    "the agreement between the results of the simulations and the theoretical predictions is good again , though not so good as in the previous cases .",
    "the reason is that in practice it is not possible to simulate perfectly a @xmath178 background with @xmath206 because such backgrounds diverge when @xmath69 tends to @xmath207 .",
    "the discrepancy between the ideal power spectrum and the simulated one gets worse when @xmath121 increases .",
    "spectral indices around 2 correspond to smooth backgrounds and are less common than smaller indices .",
    "however , they appear in certain cases .",
    "for instance , microwave observations dominated by dust emission have @xmath208 .      in the simulations presented above , our aim was reproducing the theoretical scheme using simulations .",
    "therefore , we have focused only on what happens in one pixel of the image , the pixel in which the source is located . however , in most real situations , the position of the source is not known and we will need to consider all the pixels of the image .    note that we are assuming that the position of the maximum is a good estimator of the position of the source . in practice , this is not necessaraly true . in particular ,",
    "the maximum can be shifted from the position of the source due to background fluctuations , although the probability of finding a peak due to source plus background decreases quickly as the distance to the source position increases .",
    "we have calculated the probability of a peak appearing at a certain distance @xmath209 ( in pixel units ) from the position of the simulated source for the case @xmath150 .",
    "we expect the results to be qualitatively similar for the other cases . at @xmath210",
    "we found that the probability of the peak appearing at distance @xmath211 is approximately @xmath212 for the three considered filters . at @xmath213",
    "this probability increases to @xmath214 , whereas at @xmath215 it increases to @xmath216 .",
    "when we consider @xmath217 pixels we found these probabilities to be practicaly zero for cases @xmath218 and @xmath219 , and 0.2 for @xmath220 .",
    "for @xmath221 the probability is almost zero for all cases .",
    "therefore , in a realistic situation where we need to consider all the pixels of the image , and in particular the neighbouring pixels of the source , the number of detections will slightly increase ( in a very similar manner for all the considered filters ) .",
    "regarding the number of spureous sources , they do not depend on the pixel position .",
    "thus the spureous detections will increase linearly with the considered number of pixels .",
    "this behaviour is again the same for all the filters .",
    "therefore the main conclusion is that while the global performance of the filters will be worse in a realistic case in which the position of the sources is not known , the relative performance of the filters will still be the same as that described in the previous sections .",
    "note that in our simulations the fwhm of the beam is 5 times the pixel size and that basically all maxima produced by a point source fall within the beam size .",
    "therefore , by simply using the position of the maximum as an estimator of the position of the source , this last quantity can be determined with a precision given by the beam size of the experiment .",
    "more ellaborated techniques can be used to improve the determination of the position .",
    "for instance one could use the average of the points at half the peak intensity along the slopes of the image , or fitting these points to a certain profile .",
    "this is out of the scope of the present paper and remains for a future work .",
    "now consider that the true amplitude of the source is unknown .",
    "this is the most frequent case in practise .",
    "in such a case , one must both detect and estimate the amplitude of the sources that are supposed to be embedded in the data .",
    "this problem can be confronted by adopting the methodology considered at the end of section  [ sec : simple_measurement ] : in absence of any a priori information about the p.d.f .",
    "@xmath76 we assume uniformity in the interval @xmath222 $ ] , where @xmath168 is some cut threshold over which it is not expected to find sources . an approximate value of @xmath168 can be obtained directly from the data under consideration simply by adopting @xmath223 , where @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the maximum and minimum data values , respectively . in practise , it is very unlikely that a source with normalized amplitude greater than the previous value is present in the data . if the p.d.f .",

    "half of the simulations had a gaussian source of @xmath180 pixels located at the central pixel , whereas the other half had only noisy background .",

    "then we compare three different filters that have been thoroughly used in the study of cosmic microwave background radiation data : the mexican hat wavelet , the matched filter and the scale - adaptive filter .",

    "we find that , regarding this last quantity , there are three different regions demarcated by the value of the index @xmath121 : for @xmath247 the mf outperforms the other two in the reliability sense as well as in total number of true detections . for @xmath248 the mf and the saf coincide . for @xmath249",

    "there is a positive bias due to a selection effect . with these filters and the likelihood estimator ,",
    "it is possible to safely reach thresholds as low as @xmath253 in the filtered data . due to the amplification effect of the filters , the equivalent thresholds in the unfiltered maps",
    "can be really low , specially for high @xmath121 indexes .",
    "as an example , in the case @xmath188 the mf produced in our simulations a mean gain of @xmath254 , this meaning that the ` safe threshold ' of @xmath255 after filtering translates into a @xmath256 threshold before filtering .",
    "the ideas presented in this paper can be generalized to more general filtering schemes and for two - dimensional data sets . in this case ,",
    "other quantities such as the ellipticity of the peaks can be useful to establish decision criteria similar to the ones presented here . a future work will address this particular issue .",
