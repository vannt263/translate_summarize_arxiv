    "there is growing interest in the idea of utilizing cooperative communication @xcite to improve the performance of wireless networks with time varying channels .",
    "the motivation comes from the work on mimo systems @xcite which shows that employing multiple antennas on a wireless node can offer substantial benefits . however , this may be infeasible in small - sized devices due to space limitations .",
    "cooperative communication has been proposed as a means to achieve the benefits of traditional mimo systems using _ distributed single antenna _ nodes .",
    "much recent work in this area promises significant gains in several metrics of interest ( such as diversity @xcite@xcite , capacity @xcite , energy efficiency @xcite , etc . ) over conventional methods .",
    "we refer the interested reader to a recent comprehensive survey @xcite and its references .",
    "the main idea behind cooperative communication can be understood by considering a simple @xmath0-hop network consisting of a source @xmath1 , its destination @xmath2 and a set of @xmath3 relay nodes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .",
    "suppose @xmath1 has a packet to send to @xmath2 in timeslot @xmath4 .",
    "the channel gains for all links in this network are shown in the figure . in direct communication",
    ", @xmath1 uses the full slot to transmit its packet to @xmath2 over link @xmath5 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one](a ) . in conventional multi - hop relaying",
    ", @xmath1 uses the first half of the slot to transmit its packet to a particular relay node @xmath6 over link @xmath7 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one](b ) .",
    "if @xmath6 can successfully decode the packet , it re - encodes and transmits it to @xmath2 in the second half of the slot over link @xmath8 . in both scenarios , to ensure reliable communication , the source and/or the relay must transmit at high power levels when the channel quality of any of the links involved is poor . however , note that due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions , other relay nodes may receive the signal from the transmission by @xmath1 and can cooperatively relay it to @xmath2 .",
    "the destination now receives multiple copies / signals and can use all of them jointly to decode the packet . since these signals have been transmitted over independent paths ,",
    "the probability that all of them have poor quality is significantly smaller .",
    "cooperative communication protocols take advantage of this _ spatial diversity gain _ by making use of multiple relays for cooperative transmissions to increase reliability and/or reduce energy costs .",
    "this is different from traditional multi - hop relaying in which only one node is responsible for forwarding at any time and in which the destination does not use multiple signals to decode a packet .",
    "-hop network with source , destination and relays .",
    "the time slot structures for different transmission strategies are also shown . due to the half - duplex constraint ,",
    "cooperative protocols need to operate in two phases .",
    "hence , there is an inherent loss in the multiplexing gain under any such cooperative transmission strategy over direct transmission.,width=340 ]    because of the half - duplex nature of wireless devices , a relay node can not send and receive on the same channel simultaneously .",
    "therefore , such cooperative communication protocols typically operate over a two phase slot structure as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : one](c ) and [ fig : one](d ) . in the first phase",
    ", @xmath1 transmits its packet to the set of relay nodes . in the second phase ,",
    "a subset of these relays transmit their signals to @xmath2 .",
    "note that the destination may receive the source signal from the first phase as well . at the end of the second phase",
    ", the destination appropriately combines all of these received signals to decode the packet .",
    "the exact slot structure as well as the signals transmitted by the relays depend on the cooperative protocol being used . ] for example , fig . [",
    "fig : one](c ) shows the slot structure under a cooperative scheme that transmits over orthogonal channels .",
    "specifically , the time slot is divided into @xmath9 equal mini - slots . in phase one",
    ", the source transmits its packet in the first mini - slot . in the second phase ,",
    "the relays transmit one after the other in their own mini - slots .",
    "[ fig : one](d ) shows the slot structure under a cooperative scheme in which the cooperating relays use distributed space - time codes ( dstc ) or a beamforming technique to transmit simultaneously in the second phase .",
    "it should be noted that due to this half - duplex constraint , there is an inherent loss in the multiplexing gain under any such cooperative transmission strategy over direct transmission .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop algorithms that cooperate opportunistically .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a mobile ad - hoc network with _ delay - limited _ traffic and cooperative communication .",
    "many real - time applications ( e.g. , voice ) have stringent delay constraints and fixed rate requirements . in slow fading environments ( where decoding delay is of the order of the channel coherence time ) , it may not be possible to meet these delay constraints for every packet .",
    "however , these applications can often tolerate a certain fraction of lost packets or outages .",
    "a variety of techniques are used to combat fading and meet this target outage probability ( including exploiting diversity , channel coding , arq , power control , etc . ) .",
    "cooperative communication is a particularly attractive technique to improve reliability in such delay - limited scenarios since it can offer significant spatial diversity gains in addition to these techniques .",
    "much prior work on cooperative communication considers physical layer resource allocation for a static network , particularly in the case of a single source .",
    "objectives such as minimizing sum power , minimizing outage probability , meeting a target snr constraint , etc . , are treated in this context @xcite .",
    "we draw on this work in the development of _ dynamic _ resource allocation in a stochastic network with fading channels , node mobility , and random packet arrivals , where _ opportunistic cooperation decisions _ are required .",
    "dynamic cooperation was also considered in the prior work @xcite which investigates throughput optimality and queue stability in a multi - user network with static channels and randomly arriving traffic using the framework of lyapunov drift .",
    "our formulation is different and does not involve issues of queue stability . rather , we consider a delay - limited scenario where each packet must either be transmitted in one slot , or dropped .",
    "this is similar to the concept of _ delay - limited capacity _",
    "also related to such scenarios is the notion of _ minimum outage probability _ @xcite .",
    "these quantities are also investigated in the recent work @xcite that considers a @xmath10 node static network with rayleigh fading and shows that opportunistic cooperation significantly improves the delay - limited capacity .    in this work , we use techniques of both lyapunov drift and lyapunov optimization @xcite to develop a control algorithm that takes dynamic decisions for each new slot . different from most work that applies this theory ,",
    "our solution involves a @xmath0-stage stochastic shortest path problem due to the cooperative relaying structure .",
    "this problem is non - convex and combinatorial in nature and does not admit closed form solutions in general .",
    "however , under several important and well known classes of physical layer cooperation models , we develop techniques for reducing the problem exactly to an @xmath3-stage set of convex programs .",
    "the convex programs themselves are shown to have quasi - closed form solutions and can be computed in real time for each slot , often involving simple water - filling strategies that also arise in related static optimization problems .",
    "we consider a mobile ad - hoc network with delay - limited communication over time varying fading channels .",
    "the network contains a set @xmath11 of nodes , all potentially mobile .",
    "all nodes are assumed to be within range of each other , and any node pair can communicate either through direct transmission or through a @xmath0-phase cooperative transmission that makes use of other nodes as relays .",
    "the system operates in slotted time and the channel coefficient between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath12 in slot @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we assume a block fading model @xcite for the channel coefficients so that their value remains fixed during a slot and changes from one slot to the other according to the distribution of the underlying fading and mobility processes .    for simplicity , we assume that the set @xmath11 contains a single source node @xmath1 and its destination node @xmath2 and that all other nodes act simply as cooperative relays .",
    "this is similar to the single - source assumption treated in @xcite for static networks .",
    "we derive a dynamic cooperation strategy for this single source problem in sec .",
    "[ section : cnc ] that optimizes a weighted sum of reliability and power expenditure subject to individual reliability and average power constraints at the source and at all relays .",
    "this highlights the decisions involved from the perspective of a source node , and these decisions and the resulting solution structure are similar to the multi - source scenario operating under an orthogonal medium access scheme ( such as tdma or fdma ) studied later in sec .",
    "[ section : extensions ] . in the following ,",
    "we denote the set of relay nodes by @xmath14 and the set @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "all nodes @xmath17 have both long term average and instantaneous peak power constraints given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "we consider two models for the availability of the channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "the first is the _ known channels , unknown statistics _ model . under this model , we assume that the channel gains between the source node and its relay set and destination as well as the channel gains between the relays and the destination are known every slot . these could be obtained by sending pilot signals and via feedback .",
    "this model has also been considered in prior works @xcite on power allocation in static networks where , in addition to the current channel gains , a knowledge of the distribution governing the fading process is assumed . in our work , under this _ known channels , unknown statistics _ model , we do not assume any knowledge of the distributions governing the evolution of the channel states , mobility processes , or traffic .",
    "thus , our algorithm and its optimality properties hold for a very general class of channel and mobility models that satisfy certain ergodicity requirements ( to be made precise later ) .",
    "we note that the channel gain could represent just the amplitude of the channel coefficient if an orthogonal cooperative scheme is being used .",
    "however , in case of cooperative schemes such as beamforming , this could represent the complete description of the fading coefficient that includes the phase information .",
    "the second model we consider is the _ unknown channels , known statistics _ model . in this case , we assume that the current set of potential relay nodes is known on each slot @xmath4 , but the exact channel realizations between the source and these relays , and the relays and the destination , are unknown . rather , we assume only that the _ statistics _ of the fading coefficients are known between the source and current relays , and the current relays and destination .",
    "however , we still do not require knowledge of the distributions governing the arriving traffic or the mobility pattern ( which affects the set of relays we will see in future slots ) .",
    "this is in contrast to prior works that have considered resource allocation in the presence of partial csi only for static networks .    for both models",
    ", we use @xmath20 to represent the collection of all channel state information known on slot @xmath4 . for the known channels , unknown statistics model",
    ", @xmath20 represents the collection of channel coefficients @xmath13 between the source and relays and relays and destination . for the unknown channels , known statistics model",
    ", @xmath20 represents the set of all nodes that are available on slot @xmath4 for relaying and the distribution of the fading coefficients .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 lies in a space of finite but arbitrarily large size and evolves according to an ergodic process with a well defined steady state distribution .",
    "this variation in channel state information affects the reliability and power expenditure associated with the direct and cooperative transmission modes that are discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : options ] .      as an example of these models ,",
    "suppose the nodes move in a cell - partitioned network according to a markovian random walk ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] in sec .",
    "[ section : sim ] on simulations ) .",
    "each slot , a node may decide to stay in its current cell or move to an adjacent cell according to the probability distribution governing the random walk .",
    "suppose that each slot , the set of potential relays consists only of nodes in either the same or an adjacent cell of the source .",
    "suppose channel gains between nodes in the same cell are distributed according to a rayleigh fading model with a particular mean and variance , while gains for nodes in adjacent cells are rayleigh with a different mean and variance . under the known channels , unknown statistics model , the @xmath20 information is the set of current gains @xmath13 , and",
    "the rayleigh distribution is not needed . under the unknown channels , known statistics model",
    ", the @xmath20 information is the set of nodes currently in the same and adjacent cells of the source , and we assume we know that the fading distribution is rayleigh , and we know the corresponding means and variances .",
    "however , neither model requires knowledge of the mobility model or the traffic rates .",
    "suppose the slot size is normalized to integer slots @xmath21 .",
    "in each slot , the source @xmath1 receives new packets for its destination @xmath2 according to an i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli process @xmath22 of rate @xmath23 .",
    "each packet is assumed to be @xmath24 bits long and has a _ strict _ delay constraint of @xmath25 slot .",
    "thus , a packet not served within @xmath25 slot of its arrival is dropped .",
    "further , packets that are not successfully received by their destinations due to channel errors are not retransmitted .",
    "the source node has a minimum time - average reliability requirement specified by a fraction @xmath26 which denotes the fraction of packets that were transmitted successfully . in any slot @xmath4 ,",
    "if source @xmath1 has a new packet for transmission , it can use one of the following transmission modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) :    1 .",
    "transmit directly to @xmath2 using the full slot 2 .",
    "transmit to @xmath2 using traditional relaying over two hops 3 .",
    "transmit cooperatively with the set @xmath14 of relay nodes using the two phase slot structure 4 .",
    "stay idle ( so that the packet gets dropped )    we consider all of these transmission modes because , depending on the current channel conditions and energy costs in slot @xmath4 , it might be better to choose one over the other .",
    "for example , due to the half - duplex constraint , direct transmission using the full slot might be preferable to cooperative transmission over two phases on slots when the source - destination link quality is good . note that this is similar to the much studied framework of opportunistic transmission scheduling in time varying channels .",
    "further , even in the special case of static channels , the optimal strategy may involve a mixture of these modes of operation to meet the target reliability and average power constraints .",
    "let @xmath27 denote the collective control action in slot @xmath4 under some policy @xmath28 that includes the choice of the transmission mode at the source , power allocations for the source and all relevant relays , and any additional physical layer choices such as modulation and coding . specifically",
    ", we have : @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the mode choice refers to one of the @xmath30 transmission modes for the source , and where @xmath31 is the collection of coefficients @xmath32 representing power allocations for each node @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath33 for all @xmath6 under transmission mode @xmath30 ( idle ) .",
    "if the source @xmath1 chooses mode @xmath25 , we have @xmath34 for all relay nodes @xmath35 , whereas if @xmath1 chooses mode @xmath0 , we have @xmath36 for at most one relay @xmath35 .",
    "note that under any feasible policy @xmath28 , @xmath32 must satisfy the instantaneous peak power constraint every slot for all @xmath6 .",
    "also note that under the cooperative transmission option , the power allocation for the source node and the relays corresponds to the first and second phase respectively .",
    "thus , the source is active in the first phase while the relays are active in the second phase .",
    "we denote the set of all valid power allocations by @xmath37 and define @xmath38 as the set of all valid control actions : @xmath39    the success / failure outcome of the control action is represented by an indicator random variable @xmath40 that depends on the current control action and channel state .",
    "successful transmission of a packet is usually a complicated function of the transmission mode chosen , the associated power allocations and channel states , as well as physical layer details like modulation , coding / decoding scheme , etc . in this work ,",
    "the particular physical layer actions are included in the @xmath27 decision variable . specifically , given a control action @xmath27 and a channel state @xmath20 , the outcome is defined as follows : @xmath41 note that @xmath40 is a random variable , and its conditional expectation given @xmath42 is equal to the success probability under the given physical layer channel model .",
    "use of this abstract indicator variable allows a unified treatment that can include a variety of physical layer models . under the known channels , unknown statistics model ( where @xmath20 includes the full channel realizations between source and relays and relays and destination on slot @xmath4 ) ,",
    "@xmath40 can be a determinisitic @xmath43 function based on the known channel state and control action .",
    "specific examples for this model are considered in sec .",
    "[ section:2stage ] . under the unknown channels , known statistics model ( where @xmath20 represents only the set of current possible relays and the fading statistics ) ,",
    "we assume we know the value of @xmath44 $ ] under each possible control action @xmath27 .",
    "this model is considered in sec .",
    "[ section : stats ] . under both models",
    ", we assume that explicit ack / nack information is received at the end of each slot , so that the source knows the value of @xmath40 . for notational convenience ,",
    "in the rest of the paper , we use @xmath45 instead of @xmath40 noting that the dependence on @xmath42 is implicit .",
    "the basic model described above extends prior work on @xmath0-phase cooperation in static networks to a mobile environment , and treats the important example scenario where a team of nodes move in a tight cluster but with possible variation in the relative locations of nodes within the cluster .",
    "we note that our model and results are applicable to the special case of a static network as well .",
    "another example scenario captured by our model is an ofdma - based cellular network with multiple users that have both inter - cell and intra - cell mobility . in each slot , a set of transmitters is determined in each orthogonal channel ( for example , based on a predetermined tdma schedule , or dynamically chosen by the base station ) .",
    "the remaining nodes can potentially act as cooperative relays in that slot .",
    "the basic model treats scenarios in which a source node can transmit to its destination , possibly with the help of multiple relay nodes , in @xmath0 stages .",
    "while this is a simplifying assumption , the framework developed here can be applied to more general scenarios in which , in a single slot , cooperative relaying over @xmath46 stages is performed ( for some @xmath47 ) using multi - hop cooperative techniques ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath17 be a collection of non - negative weights .",
    "then our objective is to design a policy @xmath28 that solves the following _ stochastic optimization problem _ :",
    "@xmath50    where @xmath51 is the time average reliability for source @xmath1 under policy @xmath28 and is defined as : @xmath52    and @xmath53 is the time average power usage of node @xmath6 under @xmath28 :    @xmath54    here , the expectation is with respect to the possibly randomized control actions that policy @xmath28 might take .",
    "the @xmath48 and @xmath49 weights allow us to consider several different objectives .",
    "for example , setting @xmath55 and @xmath56 for all @xmath6 reduces ( [ eq : obj1 ] ) to the problem of minimizing the average sum power expenditure subject to minimum reliability and average power constraints .",
    "this objective can be important in the multiple source scenario when the resources of the relays must be shared across many users .",
    "setting all of these weights to @xmath57 reduces ( [ eq : obj1 ] ) to a feasibility problem where the objective is to provide minimum reliability guarantees subject to average power constraints .",
    "problem ( [ eq : obj1 ] ) is similar to the general stochastic utility maximization problem presented in @xcite .",
    "suppose ( [ eq : obj1 ] ) is feasible and let @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the optimal value of the objective function , potentially achieved by some arbitrary policy .",
    "using the techniques developed in @xcite , it can be shown that it is sufficient to consider only the class of stationary , randomized policies that take control decisions purely as a ( possibly random ) function of the channel state @xmath20 every slot to solve ( [ eq : obj1 ] ) . however , computing the optimal stationary , randomized policy explicitly can be challenging and often impractical as it requires knowledge of arrival distributions , channel probabilities and mobility patterns in advance .",
    "further , as pointed out earlier , even in the special case of a static channel , the optimal strategy may involve a mixture of direct transmission , multi - hop , and cooperative modes of operation , and the relaying modes must select different relay sets over time to achieve the optimal time average mixture .",
    "however , the technique of lyapunov optimization @xcite can be used to construct an alternate dynamic policy that overcomes these challenges and is provably optimal . unlike the stationary , randomized policy",
    ", this policy does not need to be computed beforehand and can be implemented in an online fashion . in the known channels model",
    ", it does not need a - priori statistics of the traffic , channels , or mobility . in the unknown channels model",
    ", it does not need a - priori statistics of the traffic or mobility .",
    "we present this policy in the next section .",
    "in this section , we present a dynamic control algorithm that achieves the optimal solution @xmath58 and @xmath60 to the stochastic optimization problem presented earlier .",
    "this algorithm is similar in spirit to the backpressure algorithms proposed in @xcite for problems of throughput and energy optimal networking in time varying wireless ad - hoc networks .",
    "the algorithm makes use of a `` reliability queue '' @xmath61 for source @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , let @xmath61 be a value that is initialized to zero ( so that @xmath62 ) , and that is updated at the end of every slot @xmath4 according to the following equation : @xmath63 + \\rho_s a_s(t)\\label{eq : p1u1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the number of arrivals to source @xmath1 on slot @xmath4 ( being either @xmath57 or @xmath25 ) , and @xmath64 is @xmath25 if and only if a packet that arrived was successfully delivered ( recall that ack / nack information gives the value of @xmath64 at the end of every slot @xmath4 ) .",
    "additionally , it also uses the following virtual power queues @xmath65 : @xmath66 +   p_i(t ) \\label{eq : p1x1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all these queues are also initialized to @xmath57 and updated at the end of every slot @xmath4 according to the equation above .",
    "we note that these queues are virtual in that they do not represent any real backlog of data packets .",
    "rather , they facilitate the control algorithm in achieving the time average reliability and energy constraints of ( [ eq : obj1 ] ) as follows .",
    "if a policy @xmath28 stabilizes ( [ eq : p1u1 ] ) , then we must have that its service rate is no smaller than the input rate , i.e. , @xmath67    similarly , stabilizing ( [ eq : p1x1 ] ) yields the following : @xmath68 where we have used definitions ( [ eq : ri ] ) , ( [ eq : ei ] ) .",
    "this technique of turning time - average constraints into queueing stability problems was first used in @xcite .    to stabilize these virtual queues and optimize the objective function in ( [ eq : obj1 ] )",
    ", the algorithm operates as follows .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the collection of these queues in timeslot @xmath4 .",
    "every slot @xmath4 , given @xmath70 and the current channel state @xmath20 , it chooses a control action @xmath71 that minimizes the following stochastic metric ( for a given control parameter @xmath72 ) : @xmath73    after implementing @xmath71 and observing the outcome , the virtual queues are updated using ( [ eq : p1u1 ] ) , ( [ eq : p1x1 ] ) . recall that there are no actual queues in the system .",
    "our algorithm enforces a strict @xmath25-slot delay constraint so that @xmath74 if the packet is not successfully delivered after @xmath25 slot .",
    "the virtual queues @xmath75 are maintained only in software and act as known weights in the optimization ( [ eq : p1ssp3 ] ) that guide decisions towards achieving our time average power and reliability goals .",
    "the control action @xmath76 ) that optimizes ( [ eq : p1ssp3 ] ) affects the powers @xmath77 allocated and the @xmath64 value according to ( [ eq : phi ] ) .",
    "the above optimization is a @xmath0-stage _ stochastic shortest path _",
    "problem @xcite where the two stages correspond to the two phases of the underlying cooperative protocol .",
    "specifically , when @xmath1 decides to use the option of transmitting cooperatively , the cost incurred in the first stage is given by the first term @xmath78 .",
    "the cost incurred during the second stage is given by @xmath79 and at the end of this stage , we get a reward of @xmath80 .",
    "the transmission outcome @xmath64 depends on the power allocation decisions in _ both _ phases which makes this problem different from greedy strategies ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in order to determine the optimal strategy in slot @xmath4 ,",
    "the source @xmath1 computes the minimum cost of ( [ eq : p1ssp3 ] ) for all transmission modes described earlier and chooses one with the least cost .",
    "note that this problem is unconstrained since the long term time average reliability and power constraints do not appear explicitly as in the original problem .",
    "these are implicitly captured by the virtual queue values .",
    "further , its solution uses the value of the _ current _ channel state @xmath20 and does not require knowledge of the statistics that govern the evolution of the channel state process .",
    "thus , the control strategy involves implementing the solution to the sequence of such unconstrained problems every slot and updating the queue values according to ( [ eq : p1u1 ] ) , ( [ eq : p1x1 ] ) .",
    "assuming i.i.d .",
    "@xmath20 states , the following theorem characterizes the performance of this dynamic control algorithm a similar statement can be made for more general markov modulated @xmath20 using the techniques of @xcite . for simplicity , here we consider the i.i.d . case .",
    "_ theorem 1 _ : ( algorithm performance ) suppose all queues are initialized to @xmath57 .",
    "then , implementing the dynamic algorithm ( [ eq : p1ssp3 ] ) every slot stabilizes all queues , thereby satisfying the minimum reliability and time - average power constraints , and guarantees the following performance bounds ( for some @xmath81 that depends on the slackness of the feasibility constraints ) : @xmath82 further , the time average utility achieved for any @xmath72 satisfies : @xmath83 where @xmath84    _ proof _ : appendix a. @xmath85    thus , one can get within @xmath86 of the optimal values by increasing @xmath87 at the cost of an @xmath88 increase in the virtual queue backlogs .",
    "the size of these queues affects the time required for the time average values to converge to the desired performance .    in the following sections , we investigate the basic @xmath0-stage resource allocation problem ( [ eq : p1ssp3 ] ) in detail and present solutions for two widely studied classes of cooperative protocols proposed in the literature : decode - and - forward ( df ) and amplify - and - forward ( af ) @xcite .",
    "these protocols differ in the way the transmitted signal from the first phase is processed by the cooperating relays . in df , a relay",
    "fully decodes the signal .",
    "if the packet is received correctly , it is re - encoded and transmitted in the second phase . in af ,",
    "a relay simply retransmits a scaled version of the received analog signal .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details on the working of these protocols as well as derivation of expressions for the mutual information achieved by them .",
    "let @xmath89 . in the following , we assume a gaussian channel model with a total bandwidth @xmath90 and unit noise power per dimension .",
    "we use the information theoretic definition of a transmission failure ( an outage event ) as discussed in @xcite , @xcite . here , an outage occurs when the total instantaneous mutual information is smaller than the rate @xmath24 at which data is being transmitted .    we first consider the case when the channel gains are known at the source ( sec . [ section:2stage ] ) . in this scenario , ( [ eq : p1ssp3 ] ) becomes a @xmath0-stage _ deterministic shortest path problem _ because the outcome @xmath64 due to any control decision and its power allocation can be computed beforehand .",
    "specifically , @xmath91 when the resulting total mutual information exceeds @xmath24 and @xmath74 otherwise .",
    "further , this outcome is a function of control actions taken over two stages when cooperative transmission is used .",
    "this resulting problem is combinatorial and non - convex and does not admit closed - form solutions in general .",
    "however , for these protocols , we can reduce it to a set of simpler convex programs for which we can derive quasi - closed form solutions . then in sec .",
    "[ section : stats ] , we consider the case when only the statistics of the channel gains are known . in this case , the outcome @xmath64 is random function of the control actions ( taken over the two stages in case of cooperative transmission ) and ( [ eq : p1ssp3 ] ) becomes a @xmath0-stage _ stochastic dynamic program_. while standard dynamic programming techniques can be used to compute the optimal solution , they are typically computationally intensive .",
    "therefore , for this case , we present a monte carlo simulation based technique to efficiently solve the resulting dynamic program .",
    "recall that in order to determine the optimal control action in any slot @xmath4 , we must choose between the four modes of operation as discussed in sec .",

    "<S> we investigate optimal resource allocation for delay - limited cooperative communication in time varying wireless networks . motivated by real - time applications that have stringent delay constraints , we develop a dynamic cooperation strategy that makes optimal use of network resources to achieve a target outage probability ( reliability ) for each user subject to average power constraints . using the technique of lyapunov optimization </S>",
    "<S> , we first present a general framework to solve this problem and then derive quasi - closed form solutions for several cooperative protocols proposed in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> unlike earlier works , our scheme does not require prior knowledge of the statistical description of the packet arrival , channel state and node mobility processes and can be implemented in an online fashion .    </S>",
