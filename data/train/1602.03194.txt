    "<S> we analyze the effect of magnetic fluctuations in superconductors with strong spin - orbit coupling and show that they drive a phase transition between two superconducting states : a conventional phase with zero center - of - mass momentum of cooper pairs , and an exotic phase with non - zero pair momentum . </S>",

    "<S> in magnetic systems , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) can induce a number of new phases , spectacularly different from the familiar ( anti-)ferromagnets and with new kinds of low energy excitations.@xcite in systems that would otherwise tend towards ferromagnetism , soc leads to a different ordering pattern  a helimagnet  where the magnetic moments rotate as function of position in a spiral structure.@xcite an even greater variety of new phenomena may arise from the combination of spin - orbit , magnetism and superconductivity.@xcite here the interplay of translation symmetry , spin - rotation symmetry and rotations of the superconducting phase offers many new possibilities for forming ordered ground states.@xcite in the presence of a zeeman magnetic field , soc is known to stabilize a condensate of cooper pairs with finite momentum.@xcite this is a variant of the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinikov ( fflo ) state@xcite where the critical ( zeeman ) magnetic field of the @xmath0-wave superconductor significantly exceeds the pauli limit . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial distinction to the conventional fflo state is that soc permits the superconducting order to exhibit a well defined chirality even in the absence of currents . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , there are no nodes in the pairing gap , and such a superconductor with finite pair momentum is robust against disorder.@xcite an additional consequence of soc is a finite spin susceptibility in the superconducting state  comparable to its normal state value  down to the lowest temperatures.@xcite    the strong response of superconductors with large soc to magnetic fields raises questions regarding the role of spin fluctuations in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity coexisting with magnetic states has been observed in several materials without inversion symmetry such as @xmath1  [ ] , @xmath2  [ ] and @xmath3  [ ] . </S>",
    "<S> another family of systems exhibiting superconductivity and magnetism are transition metal oxide heterojunctions , such as the interface between @xmath4 and @xmath5 which hosts a 2d layer of high mobility electrons.@xcite at low temperatures the electrons at the @xmath6 interface become superconducting on the background of an inhomogeneous magnetic state.@xcite in addition , the atomic soc characterizing the parent compound @xmath5 gives rise to a strong coupling between spin and momentum of rashba type.@xcite    measurements of the superconducting state in @xmath6 heterostructures have revealed a peculiar new property of superconducting films with strong soc . </S>",

    "<S> such a non - monotonic dependence of the transition temperature on the zeeman field is not unique to @xmath6 heterostructures ; it is even more pronounced in @xmath8 films.@xcite the presence of magnetic impurities was proposed to account for this behavior,@xcite but has been ruled out experimentally.@xcite moreover , formation of a paired state at finite momentum that protects superconductors with soc from pair breaking effects up to high zeeman fields , does not explain this surprising dependence of @xmath7 on the external field . motivated by this unexpected behavior , we study the effect of magnetic fluctuations on the phase diagram of superconductors with strong soc . </S>",
    "<S> we show that magnetic fluctuations in the superconducting state can drive a second - order phase transition between two different superconducting states , one with uniform order parameter @xmath9 and another with @xmath10 . </S>",

    "<S> soc enters the free energy in two important ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , the term @xmath37 is only allowed in the absence of inversion symmetry , and its coefficient is proportional to @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the spin susceptibility @xmath39 is only weakly affected by superconductivity , and in particular , remains non - zero deep in the superconducting state @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the vanishing spin susceptibility of conventional superconductors without soc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , soc gives rise to an anisotropic @xmath39 in the superconducting state ; the spin susceptibility normal @xmath41 and parallel @xmath42 to the plane are no longer equal . to study the universal properties of the system , it is convenient to adopt a phase - only formulation , writing @xmath43 . under this approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the free energy takes the form : @xmath44 here , @xmath13 is the superfluid stiffness , and @xmath45 grows from @xmath46 near the transition temperature @xmath7 to @xmath47 as @xmath40 , where @xmath48 is the electron spin susceptibility.@xcite from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : phaseonlyfe ] it follows that superconducting currents are accompanied by a finite magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the supercurrents that encircle a vortex carry a spin structure that resembles a magnetic monopole.@xcite    integrating out massive fluctuations of @xmath49 generates short - range interactions for the pairing field , which are reflected in nearest and next - nearest - neighbor couplings of @xmath50 in the lattice model . in the absence of an external magnetic field the free energy becomes @xmath51 ^ 2\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient @xmath52 is positive provided the system is in a paramagnetic phase ; it grows as the magnetic transition is approached and the corresponding fluctuations become stronger . </S>",
    "<S> while the first term is minimized by configurations with uniform @xmath50 , the second term favors the phase on neighboring sites to differ by @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> there , frustration induces a transition into a helical ferromagnetic state @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , depending on the relative strength of the two contributions to the free energy ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : phaseonlyfinal ] ) , the system can be in one of two states : ( i ) a superconductor with a uniform phase @xmath58 and ( ii ) a superconductor with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the latter is only possible when both soc and magnetic fluctuations are present ( @xmath60 ) .     for ( a ) @xmath61 ( b ) @xmath62 and ( c ) @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition temperature is found from the phase - only model assuming the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath64 has a weak dependence on @xmath65 . </S>",

    "<S> we approximate the transition temperature by the effective phase stiffness , i.e. , the coefficient of @xmath67 in the expansion of the free energy . at the transition between the two superconducting phases the stiffness vanishes , as shown in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> similar behavior is known to occur in certain magnetic systems , such as the frustrated spin system described above , at the lifshitz point.@xcite within mean - field theory , a second - order transition between superconducting states with @xmath68 and @xmath69 occurs at @xmath70 . on a square lattice and for @xmath71 </S>",

    "<S> these states are characterized by the superconducting order parameter @xmath64 as well as a chiral order parameter @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ordered state intertwines rotations of the superconducting phase with translations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the states with @xmath69 have non - zero spin magnetization which is proportional to the chiral order parameter . the observation that as magnetic fluctuations or the strength of soc increase the system undergoes a phase transition into a superconducting state with finite pair momentum is a key result of our work .    </S>",
    "<S> we now return to the question of vortex excitations . </S>",
    "<S> previous studies of the kosterlitz - thouless transition in closely related magnetic systems showed that near the critical point , helical order may survive even when vortex proliferation destroys magnetic order.@xcite vortex physics , however , becomes important only in the close vicinity of the lifshitz point , and thus , does not change our main conclusion .    in the presence of a constant external magnetic field @xmath74 , the phase transition is replaced by a smooth crossover , and the phase stiffness remains finite for all values of @xmath12 , see fig .  1 . </S>",

    "<S> the phase @xmath78 changes from @xmath79 at low zeeman field to @xmath53 at very high field . within mean field theory , the phase difference @xmath15 in the direction perpendicular to the field is non - zero for all @xmath12 . for @xmath80 </S>",
    "<S> the phase difference equals @xmath78 and tracks the zeeman field , while at large @xmath12 it acquires a contribution that is independent of the external field ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the zeeman field enhances the transition temperature as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 . this result is applicable as long as the magnitude of the order parameter @xmath81 is independent of magnetic field . since soc protects superconductivity from pair breaking effects up to zeeman fields well above the pauli limit , at weak @xmath65 the phase only model captures the main effect . at higher magnetic fields suppression of @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be dominant . </S>",

    "<S> consequently there are no nodes in the pairing gap , which rules out probes such as specific heat measurements that are frequently used in search of the fflo state . instead , </S>",
    "<S> phase sensitive techniques must be employed , e.g. , measuring the critical current in a josephson junction . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , a number of striking signatures arise in a ring geometry due to the sensitivity of the superconducting phase to boundary conditions .    . </S>",

    "<S> this implies that ground states with constant phase difference are only possible for @xmath106 . </S>",
