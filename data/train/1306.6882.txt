    "pseudopotentials ( also known as effective core potentials ) are used to replace the chemically inert core electrons within electronic structure calculations .",
    "the use of pseudopotentials reduces the number of electrons that must be treated explicitly , and reduces the size of the basis set required to represent the one - electron orbitals .",
    "pseudopotentials are particularly useful for heavy elements because eliminating the numerous core electrons greatly increases the efficiency of the calculations .",
    "pseudopotentials are also used for light elements , even for hydrogen , because it can be advantageous to work with smooth pseudo - orbitals .",
    "the atomic pseudopotentials that we describe here can be used with a range of many - body techniques , including quantum chemical methods . however",
    ", our interest is mainly in quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations using the variational quantum monte carlo ( vmc ) and the more accurate diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) methods .",
    "@xcite these approaches can provide accurate energies with a computational cost that scales with the number of particles , @xmath0 , as approximately @xmath1 , which is better than other correlated wave function methods .",
    "the scaling of the computational cost of qmc calculations with atomic number @xmath2 is , however , approximately @xmath3.@xcite using a pseudopotential reduces the effective value of @xmath2 and makes qmc calculations feasible for heavy atoms",
    ". the relatively small memory requirements of qmc calculations also facilitates applications on massively parallel computers .    in many quantum chemical methods it is possible to use a frozen - core approximation to reduce the computational effort , but it has not so far proved possible to implement a frozen - core approximation in a straightforward manner within the vmc and dmc methods , and therefore pseudopotentials have been used instead .",
    "in addition , core - polarization effects can be included within the pseudopotential formalism,@xcite so that the calculations go beyond the frozen - core approximation .",
    "the plane wave basis sets often used in hartree - fock ( hf ) and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for extended systems have the advantage that they can be improved systematically by increasing a single parameter , the plane wave cutoff energy . correlated electron calculations have recently been performed using plane wave basis sets,@xcite for which pseudopotentials are almost always used to ensure that the required basis set is of a reasonable size .",
    "calculations using smooth hf - based pseudopotentials @xcite have yielded good results in correlated electron calculations , which appear to be superior to those obtained with dft - based pseudopotentials.@xcite the hf - based pseudopotentials do not include correlation effects , and it is likely that more accurate pseudopotentials could be developed for correlated - electron calculations by starting from a correlated - electron theory .",
    "acioli and ceperley@xcite showed that pseudopotentials can be formulated within many - body theory using the density matrix .    in this paper",
    "we describe a scheme based on the density matrix for generating atomic pseudopotentials using data from correlated electron calculations .",
    "correlated electron pseudopotentials ( cepps ) are generated for the h , li , be , b , c , n , o and f atoms .",
    "we choose first row atoms as they allow the use of the same basis set for ae and pseudopotential calculations , resulting in a consistent basis set error . for second row atoms and beyond such a choice is in principle possible , but in practice is numerically problematic . neither he or ne are considered due to the absence of experimental molecular data . to generate the cepps we use a combination of data from multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf)@xcite atomic calculations performed on a radial grid using the atsp2k code@xcite , and _ ab initio _ data for atomic core polarizabilities .",
    "the cepps are tested by comparing with results obtained from all - electron ( ae ) coupled - cluster single double triple ccsd(t ) calculations performed with large gaussian basis sets and the molpro@xcite code .",
    "we perform tests for atomic energy levels , ionization energies and electron affinities , and for the relaxed geometries , well depths , and total zero - point vibrational energies ( zpves ) of 35 small molecules .",
    "we also compare our ccsd(t ) results with a set of highly accurate experimental , semi - empirical , and _ ab initio _ data , which are referred to in the text as ` accurate ' .",
    "the semi - empirical results are used only when they have been considered to be more accurate than the available experimental data .    we have constructed our cepps using atomic states with a single valence electron , which are therefore ionized states for all atoms considered , except h and li . there is no need to use highly ionized states to generate pseudopotentials within single particle theories , such as hf and dft , because the construction of the pseudo - atom and resulting pseudopotential is straightforward . in the many - body case , however , the construction of the pseudo - density matrix and associated pseudo - hamiltonian describing an atom with more than one valence electron is a challenging task , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ theory_pseudo_atoms ] .",
    "the error due to transferring a pseudopotential from the highly ionized environment in which it is constructed to neutral or near neutral environments is partially corrected by modifying the ionic calculations .",
    "the remaining error is part of that tested by our ccsd(t ) calculations .",
    "the paper is arranged in three parts . in sec .",
    "[ cepps_theory ] we describe our method for generating the cepps , which is divided into subsections on : [ theory_pseudo_atoms ] theory of many - body pseudo - atoms ; [ single - valence - electrons ] theory of pseudopotentials for single - valence - electron atoms ; [ details_generation ] a discussion of more subtle aspects of the generation and implementation ; and [ parameterization ] parameterization in a standard form for quantum chemistry packages .",

    "the many - body density matrix for a @xmath4-electron atom is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a many - body wave function . in order to reproduce the scattering properties of the @xmath4-electron system using a pseudopotential describing @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) `` valence '' electrons ,",
    "we define a spherical core region centered on the nucleus ( that is , for any @xmath9 ) .",
    "we then reduce the full density matrix to an @xmath7-electron density matrix outside of the core region where all @xmath10 , and continue the @xmath7-electron density matrix with some model form for any @xmath9 .",
    "details of this generalization of the one - body lders relation@xcite to many - body systems are given by acioli and ceperley@xcite .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath4-body density matrix to a @xmath7-body form is accomplished by integrating over @xmath11 electron coordinates :    @xmath12    @xmath13 is the @xmath7-body density matrix for @xmath7 electrons for all @xmath10 , which is the quantity that must be preserved so that the @xmath7-body pseudopotential reproduces the scattering properties ( to first order in the energy ) of the @xmath4-body system . to reproduce the scattering of the all - electron system we define the pseudo - density matrix outside of the core region by @xmath14 with @xmath15 for any @xmath16 defined such that it is correctly normalized and well behaved .",
    "standard norm - conserving independent electron pseudopotentials @xcite are defined using valence orbitals only , but the reduced density matrix considered so far contains a contribution from the core orbitals .",
    "consequently , for independent electrons , a pseudopotential defined from the reduced density matrix can not be equivalent to the standard norm - conserving pseudopotential . to allow the two to be equivalent",
    "we define a modified density matrix .",
    "we separate the underlying wave function into core and valence parts , confine the core part to the core region , construct a @xmath4-body density matrix , and reduce it to a modified @xmath7-body matrix .",
    "this is achieved by expressing @xmath6 as a sum of determinants @xmath17 where the @xmath18 are coefficients .",
    "the determinants are formed from the natural orbitals ( nos ) , @xmath19 , which are eigenfunctions of the density matrix with occupation numbers , @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 nos with the largest occupation numbers , @xmath20 , are identified as the core nos .",
    "the determinants containing one or more core nos are classified as core determinants , @xmath22 , while the others are classified as valence determinants , @xmath23 . in this notation @xmath6",
    "is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are taken to be the valence and core components of the wave function .",
    "note that for the special case of a hf wave function the sole determinant would be classified as a core determinant .",
    "in the next step the core nos present in each @xmath22 are modified such that they are zero outside of the core region , which gives a modified wave function , @xmath27 and a modified density matrix @xmath28 this modification is desirable for the same reason as in the independent particle case ; the scattering properties of the pseudo - system are modified by a very small amount , but significantly smaller values of @xmath29 can be used .",
    "it is important to note that explicit modification of the core nos is neither required nor used in the cepp generation procedure described below , and the remaining non - core nos are not modified .",
    "this aspect of our scheme is essentially a many - body generalization of the removal of core orbitals in the generation of standard dft or hf norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "reduction to a @xmath7-body matrix with all coordinates constrained to lie outside of the core region provides    @xmath30    an important property of this modification and reduction procedure is that although core determinants do not contribute to @xmath31 outside of the core region , they do contribute to @xmath32 outside of the core region .",
    "it is this property that ensures that the cepp is equivalent to a standard norm - conserving hf pseudopotential when the multi - determinant expansion is replaced by a single ( core ) determinant . a proof of this property is given in the appendix .",
    "the density matrix @xmath15 must be preserved for a @xmath7-body system to reproduce the scattering properties of the @xmath4-body all - electron atom , but @xmath32 must be preserved for a @xmath7-body system to reproduce the scattering properties of the @xmath4-body all - electron atom with the core electrons constrained to lie within the core region .",
    "note that the division of @xmath6 into core and valence parts is not unique .",
    "our choice can , however , be justified by noting that the nos provide the most efficient orbital representation of a wave function as a sum of determinants , and that the no occupation numbers associated with occupied ( unoccupied ) orbitals are the largest ( smallest ) possible for all choices of orbitals.@xcite    in principle the next step should be to define the @xmath7-body density matrix in the core region @xmath33 in such a manner that there are @xmath7 pseudo - electrons and the density - matrix is smooth .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial problem .",
    "even if this could be solved , we would then need to invert the many - body quantum schrdinger equation to obtain a potential whose ground state has density matrix @xmath32 .",
    "again , this is a highly non - trivial problem to which a solution would in general be a @xmath7-body effective potential . to put this another way , in addition to the familiar core - electron pseudo - interaction naturally identifiable as a pseudopotential , there would also be core - electron - electron pseudo - interactions , etc .",
    ", up to and including a @xmath34-body interaction .    to avoid this difficulty we consider only the special case of a single valence electron . the @xmath7-body modified density matrix is then given by @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are the non - core unmodified nos with indices ordered by decreasing @xmath37 .",
    "note that although a valid density matrix must be representable by a complete set of orthonormal functions , this condition does not invalidate eq .",
    "( [ onedm ] ) .",
    "orthonormality is allowed since our definition is over a subspace only , and completeness is allowed since we may introduce a subset of additional nos with zero occupancy that do not contribute to the sum .",
    "since there is only one valence electron , the charge density contains the same information as the density matrix and we can work in terms of the pseudo - density , @xmath38 , defined as @xmath39 with @xmath40 constructed to give the required particle number and satisfy various smoothness conditions . finding the one - body potential for which @xmath38 is the ground state is then straightforward .    before describing the implementation of such an inversion procedure",
    ", it is worth clarifying the separation of core and valence electrons used above .",
    "this separation procedure is a natural generalization of mean - field norm - conserving pseudopotential theory to many - body theory , is equivalent for non - interacting electrons in a mean - field , and is no more _ ad hoc _ than the well established procedure of removing core orbitals in mean - field pseudopotential theory .",
    "the pseudopotential provided by the inversion procedure describes the effect of core electrons on valence electrons , including correlation .",
    "from this perspective it is apparent that the cepp fits naturally into the methodology of correlated wave function methods .",
    "the effects of correlation involving core electrons is described by the external potential part of the ( pseudo-)hamiltonian , whereas correlation between valence electrons remains a direct consequence of electron - electron interactions .",
    "for example , a ` hf ' calculation using cepps includes all correlation except that between valence electrons , and post - hf methods naturally add the correlation between valence electrons to provide a complete description of the correlation effects .",
    "to create a pseudopotential for a single - valence - electron system we calculate a one - body potential that generates the density ( and therefore the one - body density matrix ) of the all - electron correlated atom outside of the core region .",
    "we calculate the nos and occupation numbers on a numerical grid using the atsp2k code@xcite .",
    "core electron excitations are included in the active space ( as ) so as to describe core - valence and intra - core correlation .",
    "the finite as manifests itself as the requirement that only a finite number of orbitals can be included in the calculation , with each indexed by an angular momentum eigenvalue @xmath41 and an index analogous to the primary quantum number of hydrogenic atoms , @xmath7 .",
    "we have employed the largest ranges of @xmath7 and @xmath41 that avoid numerical errors arising from linear dependence problems which , in practice , corresponds to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , with the removal of one or two @xmath44 , high @xmath41 orbitals for li , be , and b. these ranges , together with the single and double excitations of the core and valence electrons , define the as used .",
    "the lowest energy states of different symmetries are considered in order to construct potentials for the @xmath45 , @xmath4 and @xmath46 angular momentum channels of a non - local pseudopotential .",
    "for example , the mchf data for carbon are generated for the c^3+^ ion in the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 configurations .",
    "we divide the radial space into three regions , in a manner similar to lee _ _ et al.__@xcite , defining the pseudopotential and pseudo - orbital separately in each region .",
    "the potential for each angular momentum channel @xmath41 is written as @xmath50 the core region is denoted by @xmath51 , and the outer part is divided into two regions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in principle",
    "the latter division is not necessary , but it is useful in controlling the numerical problems that arise far from the nucleus where the density decreases exponentially .    in region",
    "@xmath53 we take the potential to have the form @xmath54 which is the sum of terms due to the valence charge @xmath55 , and core - valence correlation effects , with the latter described by a core polarization potential ( cpp ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath56 is the dipole core - polarization parameter .",
    "higher order terms ( corresponding to quadrupole polarizability and higher ) are not considered here since they are negligible , provided @xmath57 is sufficiently large .",
    "this form provides the correct asymptotic potential far from the nucleus .",
    "the pseudopotential in region @xmath52 is constructed directly from the mchf charge density .",
    "a pseudo - orbital is defined by @xmath58^{1/2}$ ] and the pseudopotential is obtained by inverting the radial schrdinger equation : @xmath59 it is tempting to identify @xmath60 with some target eigenvalue , but this is not necessary since the potential in region @xmath51 has not yet been defined .",
    "instead we note that the potentials should be continuous at @xmath61 , which leads to @xmath62 the potential has a very small discontinuity in its first derivative at @xmath61 .",
    "the potential in region @xmath52+@xmath53 is thus defined as that which reproduces the target charge density outside of the core region .",
    "note that @xmath57 must be large enough for @xmath63 of eq .",

    "we provide a target density , @xmath38 , in regions @xmath75 , which results in the density @xmath40 in regions @xmath76 . before commencing we clarify the relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath40 in region @xmath75 . for the ideal case where an exact @xmath38 is available we could take the limit @xmath77 , so that @xmath56 would not be required ( core polarization effects would still be present since the ae wave function is correlated ) .",
    "furthermore , we would have @xmath78 , where @xmath51 is the exact ionization energy of the ion ( for example , for carbon this would be the difference between the total energies of c^3+^ and c^4+^ ) , so we would exactly reproduce the ionization energy and the charge density outside of the core region . for a limited as ( for example a hf ae calculation )",
    "the same desirable properties occur , as long as @xmath77 can be used to eliminate region @xmath53 .",
    "region @xmath53 exists when @xmath57 is finite , and the potential within this region is approximate .",
    "consequently , @xmath79 , but it is an accurate approximation since @xmath60 approaches @xmath80 with increasing @xmath57 , which ensures that @xmath40 approaches @xmath38 with increasing @xmath57 . to put this another way , provided that eq .",
    "( [ v_iii ] ) is a good approximation , the pseudopotential will reproduce the ae ionization energy and ( modified ) density matrix outside of the core region .",
    "note that the quantities that must be supplied for generating the pseudopotential are the target density in region @xmath75 , and the core - polarization parameter , @xmath56 . a target eigenvalue is not required .      in the above discussion",
    "the pseudopotential describes the frozen core of an ion ( e.g. , c^3+^ ) , whereas it would be better for the core implicit in the pseudopotential to be that of the neutral atom , as this is closer to the electronic states of interest .",
    "this difference is expected to be small , but we account for it by fixing the core orbitals to be those of a correlated neutral atom . the required orbitals and energies are obtained from two different mchf calculations with the same as , with all determinant expansion coefficients free to vary .",
    "first ` relaxed core ' mchf results are generated for the neutral atom , with all orbitals free to vary . from the resulting orbitals we select the @xmath81 core orbitals .",
    "next , we perform a ` fixed core ' mchf calculation , including the core orbitals of the neutral atom in the as , allowing no variation in the core orbitals , but with all the other orbitals free to vary .",
    "this provides a new set of nos , @xmath82 , from which we construct the target density of eq .",
    "( [ dens_def ] ) , and hence the ` fixed core ' pseudopotential .",
    "this procedure is used for all of the cepps generated in this work , and it provides pseudopotentials that include core - valence ( and intra - core ) correlation effects .",
    "lee _ _ et al.__@xcite have generated pseudopotentials from hf orbitals and ` accurate ' ionization energies of ions .",
    "they evaluate corrections to both the norm and ionization energy due to fixing the core to be that of a neutral atom .",
    "these hf corrections to the target norm and eigenvalue are then used with the hf orbitals of the ion to generate pseudopotentials .",
    "the approach of lee _ _ et al.__@xcite may be generalized from hf to mchf , resulting in a scheme similar to that given in this paper . at first",
    "this approach seems appealing as it includes a semi - empirical description of physical effects not present in the mchf hamiltonian via the target ionization energies , such as relativistic and finite nuclear mass effects .",
    "however , we have not considered this option further since the performance of such pseudopotentials was similar or marginally worse than our more _ ab initio _",
    "pseudopotentials for all systems considered .",
    "some further steps are required to define the cepp .",
    "the angular - momentum - dependent pseudopotential , @xmath83 , ( eq .  ( [ eq : v_l ] ) )",
    "provides an _ ab initio _ representation of the interaction between a single valence electron and the core .",
    "although this could be applied as it stands to systems containing many electrons and atoms , consideration of the semi - empirical theory of cpps strongly suggests that we can improve on this .",
    "so far we have used the term ` core - valence correlation ' to refer to all atomic correlation not represented by a hf pseudopotential .",
    "consideration of semi - empirical cpps allows us to separate this correlation into different parts , and to include the correlation ( mostly due to exchange ) arising from interactions between the separate cores of a many - atom system .",
    "the potential part of the hamiltonian , including the cpp , can be written as @xmath84 + \\left [ \\hat v_{e - e } + \\hat v_{e - i } + \\hat v_{i - i } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath85 represents core - core , core - valence and valence - valence correlation effects , @xmath86 represents valence - valence correlation effects , and the four cpp terms provide an approximate representation of core - core and core - valence correlation effects as an induced dipole interaction .",
    "considering the cpp terms separately , @xmath87 describes a one - body valence electron potential , @xmath88 describes a two - body valence electron potential , @xmath89 describes a three - body core - core - electron interaction , and @xmath90 describes a two - body inter - core interaction . generating a pseudopotential from an isolated atom can directly provide _ ab initio _ versions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and , since @xmath83 is a one - body potential generated from an ion with a single valence electron , it only provides an _ ab initio _ version of @xmath91.\\ ] ] the @xmath83 pseudopotential version of this quantity can be expected to be superior to the semi - empirical cpp description .    in light of this",
    "we use @xmath83 to provide an _ ab initio _ description of the one - body valence electron potential , but rather than ignore the other parts of the correlation we describe them using part of the semi - empirical cpp interaction .",
    "this is achieved by subtracting the one - body core - electron part of the semi - empirical cpp interaction from the _ ab initio _",
    "pseudopotential @xmath83 , and adding it back in as part of the full cpp correction .",
    "mller and meyer@xcite describe alkali dimers using configuration interaction calculations together with a cpp , and report the influence of each of the cpp terms on the equilibrium geometry and binding energy .",
    "they find the @xmath87 and @xmath89 terms to be the largest and of opposite sign .",
    "these results suggest that it is desirable to include a semi - empirical representation of the correlation that is not included in @xmath83 .",
    "we use the parameterized cpps of shirley and martin@xcite , and define a modified pseudopotential @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a short range truncation function used to remove the unphysical singularity at @xmath94 , the @xmath95 are empirically defined cutoff radii for this truncation function , and @xmath56 is the polarizability parameter used in generating @xmath83 . throughout this paper",
    "the acronym cepp refers to @xmath96 used together with the cpp , and we emphasise that the one - body valence - electron potential part of the cepp is _ ab initio _ even though the one - body valence electron potential part of the cpp is semi - empirical .",

    "we conclude that , of the three pseudopotentials , the cepps reproduce the ae zpves to the highest accuracy .",
    "the zpves calculated using the tndf pseudopotentials are marginally less accurate .",
    "the zpves calculated using the bfd pseudopotentials are significantly less accurate , with a maximum deviation from the ae results of @xmath298 greater than for the cepps , but still well within chemical accuracy of the ae results .          the differences between the ` accurate ' geometries and the ae data is significantly larger than chemical accuracy for h@xmath130o@xmath130 , h@xmath266coh , and h@xmath267n@xmath130 , where the errors occur for bond or dihedral angles .",
    "relaxing the geometry of h@xmath130o@xmath130 using the contracted aug - cc - pvtz basis results in a negligible change in bond lengths , a small improvement in the bond angle , and an error in the dihedral angle which is smaller than chemical accuracy .",
    "this suggests that the error in the original calculation arose from the absence of diffuse basis functions resulting in a poor description of bond angles involving h - h interactions .",
    "geometry optimization for h@xmath266coh using the contracted aug - cc - pvtz basis set suggests a similar source of error , resulting in a negligible change in bond lengths and an error in bond angles of chemical accuracy or less .",
    "geometry optimization of h@xmath267n@xmath130 using the contracted aug - cc - pvtz appears to increase the errors in both bond angles .",
    "however , this is probably not significant given the uncertainty in the experimental values for these quantities@xcite .",
    "there is an underlying trend for the well depths , @xmath133 , to be overestimated in the ae results as compared with the ` accurate ' data .",
    "it seems reasonable to ascribe part of this error to the absence of relativistic effects since the relativistic correction provided by oneil and gill@xcite shows a similar general behavior and magnitude , decreasing the well depth by @xmath299 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 .",
    "however , such a correction does not explain all of the error ( particularly for b@xmath130 , cn , and no@xmath130 ) .",
    "for a detailed analysis of the remaining error due to extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and correlation missing from ccsd(t ) we refer the reader to feller and peterson@xcite .",
    "our ae results agree with ` accurate ' data with a similar accuracy to that achieved by feller and peterson , with a mad and maximum deviation from the ` accurate ' data of @xmath300 and @xmath301 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 for those molecules common to both their paper and ours ( all of our set except for bh , be@xmath130 , b@xmath130 , c@xmath130 , and no@xmath130 ) . for comparison , taking the results of feller and peterson that include core - valence correlation and comparing with our ` accurate ' data results in a mad and maximum deviation of @xmath302 and @xmath303 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 .",
    "we consider the agreement between our _ ab initio _ ae results and ` accurate ' data to be as good as we could hope for , given the neglect of relativistic corrections , the correlation missing from ccsd(t ) in the complete basis set limit ( estimated@xcite to be roughly @xmath146 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 ) , and that the experimental errors@xcite , when available , fall within the range @xmath304 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 .",
    "overall the deviation of the ` accurate ' well depths from the ae results is not significantly different from the deviation of the cepp well depths from the ae data ; the mads of the ae results from the ` accurate ' data , the cepp results from the ` accurate ' data , and the cepp results from the ae results are @xmath270 , @xmath123 , and @xmath286 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 , respectively .",
    "the mad of the ` accurate ' zpves from the ae results is @xmath305 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 , with a maximum value of @xmath306 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 for c@xmath130h@xmath290 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the deviation of the cepp results from the ae values ( @xmath296 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 , and a maximum of @xmath293 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 for h@xmath267n@xmath130 ) .",
    "the data shows the general trend that the calculated harmonic zpves overestimate the ` accurate ' data , with the overestimation increasing with the number of h atoms present in each molecule .",
    "this trend is particularly apparent for the 8 larger molecules on the right hand side of fig .",
    "it is also evident in the good agreement between the ` accurate ' data and the ae results for the two largest molecules containing no hydrogen atoms , co@xmath130 and no@xmath130 , and in the small error for the diatomic molecules compared with the rest of the set .",
    "overall the deviation of the ` accurate ' zpves from the ae data appears to be dominated by cubic anharmonic effects involving hydrogen atoms@xcite , which reduce the vibrational frequencies .",
    "such effects are not included in our ae and pseudopotential calculations , suggesting that the ae harmonic zpves have provided the appropriate baseline for assessing the performance of the pseudopotentials .",
    "we have developed a scheme for generating pseudopotentials suitable for use in correlated - electron calculations . these correlated electron pseudopotentials ( cepps )",
    "are created using data from correlated - electron atomic mchf calculations and _ ab initio _ core polarizabilities .",
    "we have created cepps for the h , li , be , b , c , n , o , and f atoms , although our approach can readily be applied to heavier elements .",
    "we emphasize that the full accuracy of the cepps is obtained only when the potential of eq .",
    "[ hamilcpp ] is used , made up of an _ ab initio _ one - electron term and three many - body terms taken as part of the semi - empirical cpp potential .",
    "the cepps have been tested by performing ccsd(t ) calculations with large gaussian basis sets for various atoms and molecules and comparing the resulting equilibrium geometries , well depths , and zero - point vibrational energies of 35 small molecules with accurate ae results .",
    "the mad and maximum errors in the well depths of the 35 molecules are : cepp ( @xmath286 and @xmath285 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 ) , tndf ( @xmath283 and @xmath281 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 ) , and bfd ( @xmath284 and @xmath282 kcal@xmath147mol@xmath148 ) .",
    "these results demonstrate the superior performance of our cepps for correlated systems , as compared with the uncorrelated pseudopotentials available in the literature .",
    "the results for the geometries and zpves are similar for the different potentials .",
    "many of the cepps are generated in highly ionized states , but our results show that they can give highly accurate results for neutral systems . in the light of the known transferability problems that occur for norm - conserving dft pseudopotentials",
    "this is , perhaps , a surprising feature of our results .",
    "this can be understood by noting that our cepps are constructed by exact inversion of the pseudo - atom schrdinger equation , whereas a norm - conserving dft pseudopotential is constructed by an approximate inversion of the self - consistent kohn - sham equations ( in the sense that the exchange - correlation functional is approximate , contains self - interaction , and is linearized in the inversion process ) .",
    "consequently the cepps can be expected to show better transferability than dft pseudopotentials .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that atomic cores become less responsive to valence electrons as we move to the right of each period ( as in cpp theory ) .",
    "this suggests that although the description of core - valence interactions will become less accurate it will also exhibit a weaker dependence on the behaviour of the valence electrons .",
    "our results are consistent with this ; the transfer error for lithium was found to be negligible and as we move to the right of the period no consistent increase in error is apparent for electron affinities or first ionization energies of atoms , or for the geometries , well depths , or zpves of molecules",
    ".    it would be possible to improve the cepps by including , for example , relativistic effects , although they are small for the light atoms considered here .",
    "overall we conclude that the cepps work very well in the cases considered and that they produce better results in correlated - electron calculations than hf - based pseudopotentials available in the literature .",
    "tabulated and parameterized forms of the cepps described in this paper are given in the supplementary material.@xcite    the authors were supported by the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) of the uk .",
    "in sec .  [ theory_pseudo_atoms ] a many - body wave function made up of valence determinants and modified core determinants was defined and used to construct a @xmath4-body density matrix .",
    "this @xmath4-body density matrix was then reduced to a @xmath7-body density matrix in order to define the cepp .    it is tempting to assume that since the core determinants of sec",
    ".  [ theory_pseudo_atoms ] are zero outside of the core region the modified core determinants will not contribute to the @xmath7-body reduced density matrix ( and cepp ) in this region .",
    "this is not so . to demonstrate this we consider the special case of a hartree - fock wave function , which is a single normalized core determinant , for which the core nos are chosen to be zero outside of the core region .",
    "we define the hartree - fock wave function as a function of all electronic co - ordinates , @xmath307 , where @xmath308 , but @xmath309 are free to vary over all space .",
    "the slater determinant may then be written as @xmath310 where row and column indices are orbital and electron co - ordinate indices , respectively .",
    "the block - matrices @xmath311 and @xmath312 are composed of non - core orbitals , the block matrix @xmath313 is composed of core orbitals , and the zero - block arises from the constraint on the first @xmath7 co - ordinates and the properties of the core orbitals .",
    "note that @xmath311 is a @xmath314 matrix , @xmath312 is @xmath315 , and @xmath313 is @xmath316 .    from the properties of zero - block matrices such a determinant may be written as @xmath317 from which it follows that the @xmath4-body density matrix can be written as latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\gamma^p & = & \\psi^*_{\\rm hf } ( \\mathbf{r}_1 \\ldots\\mathbf{r}_p )               \\psi_{\\rm hf } ( \\mathbf{r}_1'\\ldots\\mathbf{r}_p ' ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{p ! }            we may then reduce this to a @xmath7-body density matrix by integration over the final @xmath319 co - ordinates , @xmath320 in this final expression @xmath13 is clearly the @xmath7-body density matrix associated with a slater determinant of the @xmath7 non - core orbitals .",
    "note that all of the above equations and statements are correct only for @xmath308 , and for core nos that are zero outside of the core region .    for a multi - determinant expansion ,",
    "the expressions given above become more complicated , but the largest contribution to the final @xmath7-body density matrix is still provided by the determinant whose expansion coefficient has the largest absolute value . no information provided by the non - core nos",
    "is lost in the cepp generation procedure .",
