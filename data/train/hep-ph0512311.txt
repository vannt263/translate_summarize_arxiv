    "there is currently an interest in the types of showers induced by ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic ray neutrinos  @xcite which will be relevant to the anita , auger and icecube experiments .",
    "the resulting showers are presumed to be initiated by the bremsstrahlung photons radiated from the electron produced in the initial reaction , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a nucleus in the target medium , and @xmath5 is a hadronic jet produced in the initial reaction . due to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm )  @xcite effect , at uhe soft electromagnetic radiation",
    "is suppressed and most of the energy of the electron is transfered directly to the photon .",
    "furthermore , the cross section for @xmath6 pair production drops at uhe and the hadronic interaction between the photon and the target nuclei may dominate while the electromagnetic interaction becomes negligible .",
    "the suppression due to the lpm effect becomes stronger depending on the density of the target medium . for a general overview of the lpm effect and electromagnetic suppression various media ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the shapes of showers may depend upon whether they are dominantly electromagnetic or hadronic  @xcite .",
    "along these lines , it also important to determine what fraction of showers are due to charmed particles .",
    "this is important for icecube and macro because an increase in the number of charmed mesons in the initial reaction will increase the number of high energy muons seen in experiments , but the contribution of high energy muons is one factor used to determine the composition of cosmic rays .",
    "in addition , charmed particles contribute to the flux of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "thus , experiments will need to take this contribution into account in searches for diffuse astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "for example , constraints on the uhe neutrino flux are sensitive ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are sensitive to constraints on uhe photon cross sections .",
    "another possible source of uhe cosmic photons is the decay of extremely masses exotic particles , topological defects , and z - burst models  @xcite .",
    "particles with masses as high as @xmath7  ev may explain the observation of super - gzk energy cosmic rays  @xcite . indeed , the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite have shown , using both standard qcd and supersymmetric qcd , that a large part of the spectrum in the decay of super - massive particles consists of photons .",
    "a characteristic of these `` top down '' models is the existence of a large photon flux in cosmic rays .",
    "the ratio of protons to photons in the primary interaction for the production of showers can be used to distinguish between various top - down scenarios .",
    "it is necessary , in order to address the issues above , to place upper limits on the growth of the real photon cross section .",
    "upper limits have been placed on the the fraction of primary photons at @xmath8  @xcite by analysis at the auger observatory , but those upper limits are sensitive to the photon - nucleus interaction .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to combine the dipole picture ( in the limit that the incident photon is real ) with unitarity constraints and phenomenological expectations to estimate the actual growth of the real photon cross section with target nucleons / nuclei at uhe .",
    "we allow the cross section to grow with energy as fast as possible under the constraints of the s - channel unitarity , and thereby we at the very least place upper limits on the growth of photon - nucleus cross sections .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that one can not simply use a smooth extrapolation of the cross section to higher energies by assuming ( as it is often done for the case of hadron - hadron scattering ) a parameterization of the cross section inspired by the froissart bound of the form , @xmath9 .",
    "asymptotically , the photon - hadron cross section can grow _ faster _ than the rate of growth supplied by the froissart bound due to the the fact that the photon wave function is non - normalizable .",
    "in fact , as we will discuss , the rate of growth with energy of the photon - hadron cross section may be as fast as @xmath10 @xcite . because of the uncertainties involved in describing astronomically high energy photon behavior , the strategy that we take in this paper is to provide meaningful upper limits on the growth of the cross section based on the observation that the true hadronic cross section of the photon will be tamed in any realistic theory relative to what is predicted in a low order perturbative qcd description .",
    "therefore , a low order perturbative qcd description that is only corrected for definite unitarity violations supplies a absolute upper limit .",
    "we purposefully avoid including a more precise description of higher order affects ( using , e.g. , saturation , color glass condesnsate , etc ... ) in order to avoid introducing any model dependent taming effects into the description of the high energy photon .",
    "therefore , we most likely overestimate the cross section by a significant fraction , but we will see that the upper limits obtained are nevertheless useful since they provide stronger constraints than more complex models of the high energy behavior .",
    "dipole models in strong interaction physics describe the interaction of a high energy virtual photon with a hadronic target by representing the photon by a distribution over hadronic fock states of varying sizes in the light - cone formalism .",
    "this picture has become popular for studying deep inelastic scattering in the low - x limit .",
    "it is a _ dipole",
    "_ model because the very small size configurations are usually modeled by a small quark / anti - quark pair , though larger size fock states are not necessarily dipole configurations and should be thought of as more general hadronic states containing , for example , intrinsic gluon fields .",
    "the idea that hadrons should contain configurations interacting with different strength emerged first in the context of discussion of the inelastic diffraction  @xcite .",
    "this idea reemerged in connection with the introduction of the two gluon exchange model for the strong interaction @xcite . in this model",
    "the interaction of a small hadronic system with a large hadronic system is obviously proportional to the transverse size squared of this system@xcite . in this context",
    "the impact parameter representation of the scattering amplitude first introduced for high energy processes by cheng and wu @xcite in their studies of the high energy qed turned out to be useful .",
    "the relationship between the smallness of the interaction with nucleons , the small size of the incident configuration ( color transparency ) , and bjorken scaling was emphasized in @xcite where it was demonstrated that small and large size configurations give comparable contributions to @xmath11 at small x and @xmath12 - the qcd aligned jet model .",
    "the use of the eikonal model with two gluon exchange and the cheng and wu representation for the impact parameter photon wave function ( extended to finite @xmath13 ) was used to build a model of nuclear shadowing @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the cross section of the dipole nucleon interaction within the leading log approximation is actually proportional to the gluon density at high virtuality and small x , resulting in a fast growth of the total cross section .",
    "the resulting dipole - nucleon cross sections were used to take into account finite @xmath13 corrections to exclusive vector meson production in dis @xcite .",
    "splitting of the dipoles into systems of dipoles was studied within the bfkl approximation in @xcite .",
    "the dipole model was applied to the description of hera dis data by golec - biernat and wusthoff  @xcite who introduced a parameterization of the dipole cross section inspired by the eikonal model which ensured that the total cross section of the interaction of dipoles of any size would reach a finite limiting value at high energies .",
    "a more realistic model was introduced by mcdermott , frankfurt , guzey and strikman ( mfgs ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite ( the mfgs model ) the cross section for small dipole sizes was constrained to satisfy the perturbative qcd expression for the dipole - nucleon interaction , while for large sizes a growth consistent with the pattern of the pion - nucleon interaction was imposed .",
    "an important advantage of the model is that one can adjust the behavior of large size and small size configurations independently .",
    "the mfgs model was extended to an impact parameter analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , and other impact parameter analyses were done earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at small bjorken - x",
    ", the gluon distribution dominates over the quark distribution in the nucleon target , and the behavior of the small size dipole cross section is successfully predicted in leading - twist perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "however , at very small values of bjorken - x , the leading - twist gluon distribution becomes unreasonably large and qualitatively new physics is expected to dominate .",
    "the usual assumption is that , whatever qcd mechanism is responsible for extremely low - x behavior , scattering of a dipole of a given size at fixed impact parameter at sufficiently high energy occurs at or near the limit allowed by unitarity .",
    "applications of the dipole model have thus far been used mainly in searches for these qualitatively new regimes in qcd .",
    "within the dipole picture , at fixed large @xmath13 and sufficiently small x the distribution of sizes is sharply peaked around small size quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "for small photon virtualities , @xmath14 , and for the energies @xmath15  gev the distribution in sizes is dominated mostly by large sizes which lie far from the pqcd regime .",
    "however , for extremely high energy photons ( relevant to cosmic rays ) , pqcd predicts a very rapid rise in the basic cross section with an increase in dipole size . at",
    "asymptotically large photon energies , finite size configurations rapidly reach the unitarity bound and certainly lie far outside the applicability of ordinary leading - twist pqcd .",
    "thus , we expect that for real photons with astronomically large energies , a sizable contribution to the total @xmath16 cross section may arise from small size dipoles whose amplitudes in impact parameter space are close to the the saturation limit for a wide range of impact parameters . to address quantitatively the issue of the real photon - nucleon or the real photon - light nucleus interaction at cosmic ray energies we need to use a model which naturally matches with pqcd for small dipole sizes as it is the small size dipoles which will play the crucial role in the analysis of maximal possible growth of the cross section .",
    "hence we will use the mfgs model .",
    "the consistency of a particular dipole model can be checked by considering both the real photon limit and the limit of extremely high photon energies where the total cross section should start to exhibit behavior consistent with s - channel unitarity .",
    "we will demonstrate this consistency within the mfgs model in the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : section1 ] we discuss the modifications of the mfgs model necessary to apply it to real photon - nucleon scattering . in sec .",
    "[ sec : section2 ] we evaluate the rate of growth of the @xmath17-proton cross section at uhe and we indicate the advantages and limitations of the current approach .",
    "we estimate , within the model , the fraction of the total cross section due to the diffractive processes and find it to be quite close to the black disk limit of 50% .",
    "we also demonstrate that nearly 25% of the total cross section at the highest energies comes from production of leading charm ( the interaction of the photon in the @xmath18 component at photon energies of @xmath1  gev ) . for a target",
    "@xmath2c nucleus , this ratio rises to around 30% due to differences in the degree of shadowing for charm and light quark dipoles . in sec .",
    "[ sec : section3 ] we extend the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : section2 ] to the case of a @xmath2c target .",
    "we find that blindly extending the procedure we used for the proton target ( imposing an upper limit of unity on the nuclear profile function ) leads to the paradoxical result that the ratio of the nuclear and nucleon cross sections exceed the total number of nucleons , a. we explain that this is a consequence of the small thickness of the target .",
    "the main result of our investigations is the general observation that taming is necessary for the elementary cross sections of the hadronic subprocesses in @xmath17-n scattering , and that , due to the large amount of diffractive scattering for the hadronic subprocesses in @xmath17-n scattering , there is a significant amount of shadowing in @xmath17-a scattering .",

    "in the perturbative qcd dipole model , the total ( virtual ) photon - nucleon cross section due to the interaction of the small size configurations with a target is written as the convolution product of a basic perturbative cross section for the interaction of the hadronic fock component of the photon with the transverse and longitudinal light - cone wave functions of the photon , @xmath20 , see e.g. refs .",

    "@xcite , one finds that the unitarity constraint is usually violated at very low values of bjorken-@xmath19 ( ultra - high energy ) .",
    "this sort of behavior is evidence of breaking of the leading twist approximation and indicates the onset of qualitatively new qcd phenomena .",
    "however , the small size configurations of the uhe real photon wildly violate the unitarity constraint due to the rapid growth of the perturbative expression , @xmath89 at small @xmath37 even when the increase of the radius of the interaction with energy is taken into account .",
    "therefore , it becomes necessary to introduce some new assumptions about the unitarity violating components of the total cross section in order to make some sense of the uhe behavior .",
    "we choose to adhere to the usual assumption that at uhe , in the region where small size perturbative methods begin to break down , the cross section is at ( or near ) the limit set by unitarity .",
    "this assumption is supported by our studies of the amplitudes of the dipole - nucleon interaction at hera energies  @xcite . for reference , the hadron - proton amplitude that was used in ref .",

    "the dominant effect is from the diffusion factors . by making a large estimate for the amount of diffusion ( @xmath96 ) , we over estimate the amount of spreading in impact parameter space . within our approach",
    "to unitarity taming , as will become clear , this over estimate of the diffusion is consistent with the goal of obtaining an upper limit to the growth of the cross section .",
    "very large size configurations tend not to violate the unitarity constraint in a gross way - the total cross section for large size configurations increases slowly with energy , but there is suppression of the impact parameter at small @xmath100 with increasing energy due to diffusion consistent with the donnachie - landshoff soft pomeron  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the fit of  @xcite does violate s - channel unitarity for lhc energies and above .",
    "however , this leads to a very small effect for the total cross sections for the energies we discuss here .",
    "we can enforce the unitarity assumption about the high energy behavior if we re - calculate the total photo - production cross section by using the basic cross section of the mfgs model with linear interpolation everywhere _ except _ where the unitarity limit is violated . when the unitarity limit is violated , we set the cross section equal to the maximum value allowed by unitarity .",
    "more specifically , we first decompose the the basic cross section in terms of the impact parameter representation of the amplitude ( usually called the profile function ) using the optical theorem .",
    "let @xmath101 be the hadron - nucleon amplitude and let @xmath102 be the 4-momentum exchanged in the subprocess . then , we calculate , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the profile function for a configuration of size @xmath26 . the hadronic profile function that we use",

    "as we shall see , the distribution of hadronic sizes involved in the interaction becomes more and more sharply peaked around small sizes as @xmath107 .",

    "we include the charm contribution in the calculation of the cross section and note that the resulting hadronic showers will likely consist of a significant number of charmed particles like d - mesons . the contribution from the bottom quark",

    "the cross section appearing in the integrand of region 2 then becomes , @xmath233 however , the requirement that region 2 contains _ all _ of the unitarity saturating contribution , and that region 1 contains a negligible contribution demands that we allow @xmath220 to have some energy dependence .",

    "( [ eq : proof3 ] ) shows , the basic cross section at small sizes may have as much as a quadratic @xmath26-dependence and potentially very rapid energy dependence .",
    "therefore , at a small but fixed value of @xmath26 , the basic cross section quickly rises from small values to unitarity violating values with increasing energy .",
    "however , region 1 by definition contains only the suppressed part of the integrand near @xmath145 , whereas the unitarity saturating region should be associated entirely with region 2 . as the energy of the photon",
    "is increased , therefore , we must continuously redefine region 1 so that the integrand of region 1 is confined to a smaller and smaller region around @xmath145",
    ". this sort of behavior does not exist at @xmath234 , because at such large values of hadronic size , the cross section only increases as @xmath229 and there is almost no variation with hadronic size .",
    "therefore , @xmath219 is defined without any energy dependence ( @xmath219 may be given weak energy dependence , but that will only result in subleading powers of @xmath235 in the final result . ) equation  ( [ eq : proof3 ] ) tells us that the maximum rate at which @xmath220 may decrease at small @xmath26 is , @xmath236 we thus write region 2 as , @xmath237 here we have continued to use @xmath175 behavior for the squared photon wavefunction because this yields the fastest possible rate of divergence of the wavefunction at the lower end of the integral and thus yields the most conservative upper limit on the rate of growth .",
