    "[ a ]    self - similarity is a possible feature of multi - partons inside a proton at small _ x _ suggested by lastovicka @xcite and pursued by us in recent years @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have examined its consequences in @xcite double parton distribution function(dpdf ) to be tested at lhc , in froissart saturation @xcite and longitudinal structure function @xcite .",
    "one of the theoretical limitations of the model of ref @xcite is that it has a singularity at @xmath2 which is within the physically allowed range @xmath3 .",
    "even though outside its phenomenological range of validity @xmath4 , such singularity is beyond common expectations from any physically viable model of proton structure function @xmath5 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we therefore make a re - analysis of the model of ref@xcite , demanding it to be singularity free in the entire @xmath6-range of @xmath3 .",
    "present work will also study the consequences of the suggestion of ref@xcite in the context of the reported reanalysis . in section[b ] , we outline the formalism and in section[c ] , we discuss the results .",
    "section[d ] contains the conclusions .",
    "the self - similarity based model of the proton structure function of ref@xcite is based on transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function(tmd ) @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 is the parton transverse momentum squared .",
    "choosing the magnification factors @xmath9 and @xmath10 , it is written as @xcite @xmath11= d_1.log\\frac{1}{x}.log\\left(1+\\frac{k_t^2}{q_0 ^ 2}\\right)+d_2.log\\frac{1}{x } + d_3.log\\left(1+\\frac{k_t^2}{q_0 ^ 2}\\right)+d_0^i\\ ] ]    where i denotes a quark flavor . here",
    "@xmath12 are the three flavor independent model parameters while @xmath13 is the only flavor dependent normalization constant .",
    "m@xmath14(=1 gev@xmath14 ) is introduced to make ( pdf ) @xmath15 as defined below ( in eqn([e2 ] ) ) dimensionless .",
    "the integral quark densities then defined as : @xmath16    as a result , the following analytical parametrization of a quark density is obtained by using eqn([e2 ] ) @xcite @xmath17 where , @xmath18 is flavor independent . using eqn([e3 ] ) in the usual definition of the structure function @xmath5 , one can get @xmath19 or it can be written as @xmath20    where @xmath21 . from hera data @xcite , eqn([e6 ] ) was fitted with @xmath22 in the kinematical region , @xmath23      the model of ref@xcite has two inherent limitations .",
    "first , the parameter @xmath24 is negative contrary to the expectations of positivity of the fractal dimensions @xcite .",
    "secondly , due to its negative value , eqn([e6 ] ) develops a singularity at @xmath25 @xcite as it satisfies the condition @xmath26 , contrary to the expectation of a physically viable form of structure function .",
    "the model can be made singularity free under following specific conditions of the model parameters .",
    "+   + * case 1 :* if @xmath27 in eqn([e1 ] ) then the pdf eqn([e3 ] ) and the structure function eqn([e6 ] ) will be of the form : @xmath28 @xmath29 +   + * case 2 :* in this case @xmath30 in eqn([e1 ] ) then the corresponding expressions for the pdf and structure function in this limit are respectively : @xmath31 @xmath32 +   + * case 3 :* in this case , @xmath33 in eqn([e1 ] ) then the corresponding pdf and the structure function are set in the form : @xmath34 @xmath35 respectively .",
    "+   + * case 4 :* this is the most general case for the singularity free model , eqn([e6 ] ) under the condition that @xmath36 are positive .",
    "it is to be noted that the variable in which the supposed fractal scaling in the quark distribution occur is not known for the underlying theory . in ref@xcite , the choice of @xmath37 as one of the magnification factors",
    "was taken presumably because of the power law form of the quark distribution at small @xmath6 found in glck - reya - vogt ( grv ) distribution @xcite .",
    "however , this form is not derived for the theory but rather inspired by the power law distribution in @xmath38 assumed for grv distribution for qcd evaluation .",
    "the choice of @xmath37 as the proper scaling variable is not an established result of the underlying theory .    a more plausible variable appears instead to be @xmath39 @xcite which confirms to the froissart saturation @xcite of high energy interaction .    with this choice , transverse momentum dependent structure function ( tmd ) and parton distribution function ( pdf )",
    "now take the following forms @xcite @xmath40 and @xmath41    where , @xmath42 the structure function as defined in eqn([e6 ] ) becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 for very small @xmath6 and large @xmath45 , the second term of eqn([e18 ] ) can be neglected leading to @xmath46 which satisfies the froissart saturation condition , if @xmath47 within @xmath48 corrections @xcite .",
