    "the era of gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomy has come since the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) detected the first gw event , gw150914 , which is thought to be produced by the merging of a stellar mass binary black hole system @xcite . finding the electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart of the gw event is critically important in many aspects , such as identification of the gw event , study of the progenitor and its environment , fundamental physics and cosmology .",
    "although many efforts have been made to search for the purported em counterpart of gw150914 @xcite , only the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) onboard fermi @xcite recorded an excess ( denoted as gw150914-gbm ) at 0.4 s after the ligo trigger time , which is claimed to be possibly associated with this gw event @xcite .",
    "however , since there is no significant signal detected by the integral / spi - acs around the time of gw150914-gbm @xcite , a great debate has been raised about whether gw150914-gbm is of astrophysical origin and associated with the gw150914 .",
    "@xcite reported that gw150914-gbm is likely associated with the gw150914 based on the following reasons : ( a ) its time is only 0.4 s after the ligo trigger time of the gw event .",
    "( b ) its localization is not inconsistent with ligo locations of gw150914 , although quite poor due to the weakness and unfavorable incident angles to gbm detectors .",
    "( c ) its duration and spectrum are consistent with typical short gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) which is thought to be candidate of gw em counterpart .",
    "( d ) it can not be attributed to other known sources , such as solar activity , terrestrial gamma - ray flashes @xcite or terrestrial electron beams @xcite produced on the earth , magnetosphereic activities and galactic sources .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the non - detection of spi - acs suggests the gw150914-gbm is likely from magnetospheric activity or background fluctuation .",
    "but @xcite argued that the fluence of gw150914-gbm is consistent with the upper limit estimated by spi - acs for most regions of ligo arc ; about half of weak gbm events are not found by spi - acs ; the origin of magnetosphere is very unlikely because gbm is on the low magnetic latitude and the duration of gw150914-gbm is too short for the magnetospheric events usually seen by gbm .",
    "however , the reported gbm false alarm rate of 0.0022 @xcite is only of moderate significance to reject the possibility of background variation .    given that there is no other measurement in a similar energy range as gbm and spi - acs to the gw150914 region around the ligo trigger time , and that no other em counterpart detection has been reported yet , the origin of gw150914-gbm and whether gw150914 has an em counterpart remain a big mystery , but of high importance .",
    "here we focus on the observational properties of gw150914-gbm by carefully analyzing the gbm data using a straightforward but sophisticated method .",
    "gbm employs the thallium - doped sodium iodide ( nai ) and bismuth germanate ( bgo ) scintillation detectors to cover a wide energy range from 8 kev to 40 mev @xcite . since a nai detector only has a good viewing to sources within @xmath0 of the detector s normal , the response of the detector decreases rapidly when the incident angle is greater than 60@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "to form an all - sky field of view ( fov ) except the inevitable blocking by the earth in low earth orbit , gbm consists of 12 nai detectors with different orientations placed at the four corners of the spacecraft and two bgo detectors set in the opposite sides of the spacecraft ( see * ? ? ?",
    "such configuration is also used to localize astrophysical transients based on the fact that these detectors will receive different number of photons from a distant source due to different incident angles of the source to different detectors .",
    "such localization method @xcite has successfully helped gbm to localize @xmath2 2000 grbs @xcite .",
    "the gbm team has reported an excess , gw150914-gbm , with false alarm rate of 0.0022 at t0 + 0.4 s , where t0 is the ligo trigger time 2015 - 09 - 14 09:50:45.391 utc , and this event is believed to be possibly linked to gw150914 @xcite .",
    "as shown in the top panel in figure [ fig : f1 ] , we produced the summed light curve of all 14 detectors for gw150914-gbm in the same energy selection as used in @xcite , which is very consistent with the results ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "4 ) in @xcite .",
    "next we test whether gw150914-gbm is of astrophysical origin and associated with the gw event . unlike the search algorithm utilized in @xcite which is based on a weighted light curve of all 14 detectors of gbm",
    ", here we choose to use a much more straightforward but sophisticated approach : we divide all 14 detectors into two groups with one group having good viewing angles to the ligo location of the gw event and the other group bad viewing angles . according to the placement of the detectors described above",
    ", good - viewing detector group should have seen more photons than the bad - viewing group from the gw150914 , if there is any high energy emission from it .",
    "we used the calculation of the incident angle for each detector in table 2 of @xcite to decide which detector belongs to which group .",
    "it turns out that nai 2 , nai 4 , nai 5 and bgo 0 have smaller viewing angles than other detectors for all possible locations of the gw event , thus these four detectors are chosen to be the good - viewing detectors for gw150914 .",
    "the incident angle to the good - viewing group ranges from 20@xmath1 to 80@xmath1 , depending on the real location of gw150914 .",
    "we slightly relieved the usual threshold of good - viewing of 60@xmath1 to 80@xmath1 , because there are too few detectors with less than 60@xmath1 for a single location of the gw event .",
    "the other ten detectors compose the bad - viewing group because their incident angles are well greater than 80@xmath1 , resulting in either very little exposure to the gw event or completely blocked by the spacecraft .",
    "light curves for all 14 detectors , good - viewing and bad - viewing detectors are separately plotted in figure [ fig : f1 ] . in the duration of gw150914-gbm ( from t0 + 0.41",
    "s to t0 + 1.43 s ) , there are 462 ( @xmath3 = 82.1 , significance of this excess is 5.63 @xmath3 ) net counts above the fitted background level in all 14 detectors , where 306 ( @xmath3 = 67.3 , significance of this excess is 4.55 @xmath3 ) of them come from bad - viewing detectors and 156 ( @xmath3 = 47.0 , significance of this excess is 3.32 @xmath3 ) from good - viewing ones .",
    "we suggest this event is very unlikely from the gw150914 as following :    * ( i. ) the majority of the excess ( @xmath4 ) of gw150914-gbm is from bad - viewing detectors , which is inconsistent with an astrophysical source incident from the ligo localizations visible to the gbm*. the ratio of net counts of good - viewing and bad - viewing detectors for gw150914-gbm is 0.51 @xmath5 0.19 . in principle",
    ", one could do a detailed monte carlo simulation to estimate what this ratio should be for an astrophysical source ; however , such simulation is impossible without the accurate mass model of the fermi spacecraft which is unavailable for public .",
    "alternatively , we estimate the expected ratio from gbm - swift jointly - detected grbs ( shown in table [ tab : grbs ] ) with similar incident angles in spacecraft coordinates as gw150914 , because it only depends sensitively on the incident angle in the spacecraft coordinates for the spectra dominated by low - energy photons , which is always true for grbs in gbm energy range . as an example",
    ", the light curve of grb140716a is shown in figure [ fig : f2 ] .",
    "the measured net counts ratio ( 0.51 @xmath5 0.19 ) of gw150914-gbm is far away from that of grbs in table [ tab : grbs ] , consistent with the fact that the best localization of gw150914-gbm is on the earth , rather than the gw150914 locations @xcite . assume the excess in bad - viewing detectors for gw150914-gbm is from ligo locations visible to gbm , and we use 1.4 as a conservative estimation of the net counts ratio for the gw150914 , then the expected net counts in good - viewing detectors should be 306 @xmath6 1.4 = 428.4 counts , with the error the same as original measurement of 67.3 , because it is dominated by the background variation .",
    "thus this assumption is rejected in @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , as shown in the table 1 and 2 in @xcite , the bad - viewing detectors ( nai 9 , bgo 1 ) with high incident angle for all possible ligo locations have the most high significance of excess while the good - viewing detector ( nai 2 ) with much smaller incident angle has the least significance of excess .",
    "such distribution of excess among detectors is inconsistent with an astrophysical source from ligo locations .",
    "it s very likely that gw150914-gbm will not be found out by the targeted search @xcite without the excess signal in the bad - viewing detectors .",
    "the excess of gw150914-gbm in good - viewing detectors is consistent with background fluctuation*. to estimate the false alarm rate of the excess of gw150914-gbm in good - viewing detectors , we searched 216.6 ks of data of good - viewing detectors and found 56 events with higher significance , giving a false alarm rate of @xmath8 hz , much higher than that reported in @xcite . note that there are already several spikes with similar excess as gw150914-gbm within only 100 s of data in good - viewing detectors ,",
    "see panel b in figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "this suggests that the excess of gw150914-gbm in good - viewing detectors is consistent with background fluctuation .",
    "in fact , the ratio of net counts between good - viewing and bad - viewing detectors for gw150914-gbm ( 0.51 @xmath5 0.19 ) is approximately equal to the ratio of background level ( red lines in panel b and c in figure [ fig : f1 ] ) and detector number of these two detector groups .",
    "this may suggest that the gw150914-gbm is likely caused by a sudden increase of the local particles around the spacecraft .",
    "ccccccc grb140716a & grb140716436 & 134.1 & 352.2 & 8.8 & 5/6/7/8 & 1.4 @xmath5 0.2 + grb140817a & grb140817293 & 131.5 & 10.7 & 9.5 & 7/8 & 1.7 @xmath5 0.2 + grb150607a & grb150607330 & 130.1 & 7.7 & 9.3 & 6/7/8 & [ 1.7 , 11.2 ] +",
    "by using a straightforward but sophisticated method , we find that the excess of gw150914-gbm , which is suggested to be a possible counterpart of gw150914 @xcite , is mostly contributed by those gbm detectors that are not expected to see much radiation from the ligo localization region of gw150914 , whereas detectors ( nai 2 , nai 4 , nai 5 , bgo 0 ) with good exposures to the gw event did not see any significant excess beyond the background fluctuation .",
    "the distribution of excess signals among detectors of gw150914-gbm is very inconsistent from the expected value that has been demonstrated by gbm - swift jointly - detected grbs with similar incident angles as gw150914 .",
    "however , @xmath2 2000 grbs have been successfully localized based on such distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the gw150914-gbm is very unlikely associated with gw150914 , and the origin of the excess in bad - viewing detectors , which is not the focus of this paper though , is possibly due to some sudden increase in the local particles , while the relatively small excess in the good - viewing detectors is not distinguishable from the background fluctuation .",
    "since gw150914-gbm is the only event found by gbm that is possibly associated with gw150914 in a comprehensive search , the rejection of it to be an astrophysical event in the ligo localizations means that gbm did not detect any significant em counterpart of gw150914 .",
    "@xcite predicted that the merging of two astrophysical black holes will not produce any electromagnetic emission , based on the exact global solution of the dynamic and evolving metric for matter falling onto a pre - existing black hole in the frame of a distant external observer .",
    "as of today , the non - detection of em counterpart of gw150914 by a series of telescopes @xcite including fermi / gbm is consistent with this prediction @xcite .",
    "however , it is commonly believed that the in - falling matter to a black hole must approach asymptotically to but never cross the event horizon of the black hole in the frame of a distant external observer ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in this case the merging of two such objects will produce both gw and strong em radiations @xcite , through the well - known blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "because the relativistic jet produced through the bz mechanism for a gw150914-like event may not point to the observer , the non - detection of strong em radiation from just one gw150914-like event does not distinguish between the above two models ; therefore , a statistically significant sample of gw150914-like events with comprehensive em search is highly demanded .",
    "thanks to the very wide instantaneous fov , broad energy coverage and moderate localization capability , fermi / gbm is one of the best telescopes to find the purported em counterparts of the gravitational wave events . as more joint observations are undergoing between ligo and fermi / gbm , it is very promising for fermi / gbm to either find some em counterparts or put a strong constraint on the em radiation of gw150914-like events .",
