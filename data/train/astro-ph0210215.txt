    "establishing the low - redshift galaxy luminosity density of the universe is a fundamental measurement of the contents of the local universe .",
    "the last two decades , beginning with the center for astrophysics redshift survey ( @xcite ) , have seen steady progress in understanding the total galaxy luminosity density emitted in the universe .",
    "part of the progress has been due to measuring larger and larger numbers of galaxy fluxes and redshifts , from only a few hundred redshifts before 1980 to a few hundred thousand at present .",
    "however , equally importantly , the determination of galaxy fluxes has been steadily improving .",
    "the luminosity functions calculated from the cfa survey were based on `` zwicky '' magnitudes : essentially , they were determined by visual inspection of photographic material .",
    "automated processing of photographic plates provided an improved way of measuring flux ; the automatic plate measurement survey ( @xcite ) , from which targets were selected for the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) , is the latest example of this method .",
    "however , deep ccd imaging , such as that performed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , which provides a higher dynamic range and more linear response than do photographic plates , is yielding the highest signal - to - noise ratio measures of flux and the greatest surface brightness sensitivity in a large survey to date .    a preliminary estimate of the sdss galaxy luminosity function was performed by @xcite , using a small sample of commissioning data . at the time of writing ,",
    "the sdss has obtained photometry and redshifts for more than ten times the number of galaxies in the commissioning data used by @xcite ; furthermore , the photometric calibration procedures have improved since that time . in addition , we have developed a new and more self - consistent method for @xmath29-correcting galaxies to a fixed frame bandpass ( @xcite ) . finally , we have developed a maximum likelihood technique for fitting the galaxy luminosity function which allows for generic luminosity function shapes as well as luminosity and number density evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is now time to reevaluate the galaxy luminosity function in the sdss .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a friedmann - robertson - walker cosmological world model with matter density @xmath30 , vacuum pressure @xmath31 , and hubble constant @xmath32 @xmath25 km s@xmath33 mpc@xmath33 with @xmath18 , unless otherwise specified .    in section [ data ]",
    ", we describe the sdss galaxy catalog data . in section [ method ] , we briefly describe our method of fitting the luminosity function ( a fuller description of the method can be found in @xcite ) . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present our results for the galaxy luminosity density at @xmath0 . in section [ systematics ]",
    ", we test whether our results are sensitive to how we determine the galaxy magnitudes . in section [ comparison ] ,",
    "we compare our results to previous work .",
    "we conclude and discuss plans for future work in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the sdss ( @xcite ) is producing imaging and spectroscopic surveys over @xmath34 steradians in the northern galactic cap . a dedicated 2.5 m telescope ( siegmund et al .",
    ", in preparation ) at apache point observatory , sunspot , new mexico , images the sky in five bands between 3000 and 10000   ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; @xcite ) using a drift - scanning , mosaic ccd camera ( @xcite ) , detecting objects to a flux limit of @xmath40 mags . a major goal of the survey is to spectroscopically",
    "observe 900,000 galaxies ( down to @xmath41 mags ) , 100,000 luminous red galaxies ( @xcite ) , and 100,000 qsos ( @xcite , @xcite ) selected from the imaging data .",
    "this spectroscopic follow up uses two digital spectrographs on the same telescope as the imaging camera .",
    "many of the details of the galaxy survey are described in the galaxy target selection paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "other aspects of the survey are described in the early data release paper ( edr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the survey has begun in earnest , and has so far obtained about 30% of its intended data .",
    "the sdss images are reduced and catalogs are produced by the sdss pipeline photo , which measures the sky background and the local seeing conditions , and detects and measures objects .",
    "the astrometric calibration is performed by an automatic pipeline which obtains absolute positions to better than 0.1 arcsec ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitudes are calibrated to a standard star network ( @xcite ) approximately in the ab system .",
    "there are small differences between the system output by the sdss pipelines and a true ab system , amounting to @xmath42 in the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 bands .",
    "because these effects were discovered at a relatively late date in the preparation of this manuscript , we have not self - consistently included these shifts in our results .",
    "instead we have applied them _ a posteriori _ to our results in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 bands .",
    "object fluxes are determined several different ways by photo , as described in @xcite .",
    "the primary measure of flux used for galaxies is the sdss petrosian magnitude , a modified version of the quantity proposed by @xcite .",
    "the essential feature of petrosian magnitudes is that in the absence of seeing they measure a constant fraction of a given galaxy s light regardless of distance ( or size ) .",
    "more specifically , we define the `` petrosian ratio '' @xmath43 at an angular radius @xmath44 from the center of an object to be the ratio of the local surface brightness averaged over an annulus at @xmath37 to the mean surface brightness within @xmath44 : @xmath45}{\\left . \\int_0^\\theta",
    "dr ' 2\\pi \\theta ' i(\\theta ' ) \\right/ [ \\pi \\theta^2]},\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile and @xmath47 , @xmath48 define the annulus .",
    "the sdss has adopted @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the petrosian radius @xmath51 is the radius at which the @xmath43 falls below a threshhold value @xmath52 , set to 0.2 for the sdss .",
    "the petrosian flux is defined as the flux within a circular aperture with a radius equal to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 for the sdss .",
    "petrosian magnitudes are described in greater detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another important measure of flux for galaxies is the sdss model magnitude , which is an estimate of the magnitude using the better of a de vaucouleurs and an exponential fit to the image .",
    "photo also measures the flux in each object using the local psf is a template , which is the highest signal - to - noise measurement of flux for point sources .",
    "finally , photo outputs an azimuthally averaged radial profile for each object .    for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we have implemented one more measure of galaxy magnitude : a srsic  magnitude , following @xcite .",
    "we fit an axisymmetric srsic  profile to the azimuthally - averaged radial profile of the galaxy : @xmath55,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are free parameters quantifying the amplitude , size , and shape of the surface brightness profile quantitatively .",
    "we do so by convolving @xmath59 with the double gaussian fit to the seeing output by photo , and minimizing @xmath60 with respect to the observed radial profile ( using the photo catalog output describing the radial profile and its uncertainties , as described in @xcite ) . in practice ,",
    "we fit for @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the @xmath38-band and only fit for @xmath56 in the other bands , fixing @xmath57 and @xmath58 to their values in the @xmath38-band ( in analogy to the model magnitudes output by photo ) .",
    "as found by @xcite , galaxies have best fit srsic  indices ranging from around exponential profiles of @xmath61 ( which galaxies tend to be blue , low luminosity , and low surface brightness ) to quite concentrated galaxies with @xmath62@xmath63 ( which galaxies tend to be red , high luminosity , and high surface brightness ) .",
    "a de vaucouleurs profile , which is generally ascribed to elliptical galaxies , has @xmath62 .",
    "while sdss petrosian magnitudes contain over 99% of the flux within an exponential profile , they contain only around 80% of the flux within a de  vaucouleurs profile ( in the absence of seeing ) .",
    "we can evaluate the total flux contained in our srsic  model ; this estimate is corrected for seeing _ and _ is an attempt to extrapolate the profile to infinity . comparing the sdss petrosian magnitudes to the srsic  magnitudes yields a guess of how much luminosity density we are missing because of the finite petrosian aperture size .",
    "we have chosen not to use the sdss model magnitudes for this purpose because for the versions of photo used for this set of photometry , the outer radius which photo considered in its model fits was too small to accurately model large objects .",
    "to supply targets selected by the imaging program for the concurrent spectroscopic program , periodically a `` target chunk '' of imaging data is processed , calibrated , and has targets selected .",
    "these target chunks never overlap , so that once a set of targets are defined in a particular region of sky , it never changes in that region .",
    "thus , the task of determining the selection limits used in any region reduces to tracking how the target chunks cover the sky , which is done by an internal sdss operational database . within each target chunk , a target selection pipeline determines which objects are qso targets , galaxy targets , and/or star targets , depending on the properties of each object .",
    "the pipeline selects the main sample galaxies used in this paper according to an algorithm described and tested in @xcite , which has three most important steps : star / galaxy separation , the flux limit , and the surface brightness limit",
    ". expressed quantitatively , these criteria are @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dereddened petrosian magnitude in the @xmath37 band ( using the dust maps of @xcite ) , @xmath66 is the model magnitude , @xmath67 is the psf magnitude , and @xmath68 is the petrosian half - light surface brightness of the object in the @xmath37-band . in practice ,",
    "the values of the target selection parameters vary across the survey in a well - understood way , but for the bulk of the area , they are : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "as described in @xcite , there are many more details in galaxy target selection which we do not have space to discuss here .",
    "we note here that objects near the spectroscopic flux limit are nearly five magnitudes brighter than the photometric limit ; that is , the fluxes are measured at signal - to - noise of a few hundred .",
    "to drill spectroscopic plates which have fibers on these targets , we define `` tiling chunks '' which in principle can contain numerous target chunks ( and parts of target chunks ) .",
    "an automatic tiling pipeline ( @xcite ) is then run in order to position tiles and assign fibers to them , after which plates are designed ( that is , extra fibers are assigned to possibly interesting targets and calibration fibers are designed ) and then drilled .",
    "in general , these tiling chunks _ will _ overlap because we want the chance to assign fibers to targets which may have been in adjacent , earlier tiling chunks but were not assigned a fiber . for a target to be covered by a particular tile , it must be in the same tiling chunk as that tile and be within 1.49@xmath72 of the tile center ( because the edges of tiles can extend beyond the tiling chunk boundaries , a particular direction can be within 1.49@xmath72 of the tile center but not `` covered '' by it as defined here ) . to calculate the survey window function",
    ", we then divide the survey into a number of small regions known as `` sectors '' which are regions which are covered by a unique set of tiles ( the same as the `` overlap regions '' defined in @xcite ) .",
    "these sectors are described in sample10 ; the sampling rates are calculated on a sector - by - sector basis .",
    "the targets are observed using a 640 fiber spectrograph on the same telescope as the imaging camera .",
    "the results of the spectroscopic observations are treated as follows .",
    "we extract one - dimensional spectra from the two - dimensional images using a pipeline ( specbs v4_8 ) created specifically for the sdss instrumentation ( schlegel et al . in preparation ) , which also fits for the redshift of each spectrum .",
    "the official sdss redshifts are obtained from a different pipeline ( subbarao et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the two independent versions provide a consistency check on the redshift determination .",
    "the results of the two pipelines agree for over 99% of the main sample galaxies .",
    "as of april 2002 , the sdss had imaged and targeted 2,873 deg@xmath73 of sky and taken spectra of approximately 350,000 objects over @xmath74 deg@xmath73 of that area . from these results",
    ", we created a well - defined sample for calculating large - scale structure and galaxy property statistics , known as large - scale structure sample10 .",
    "sample10 consists of all of the photometry for all of the targets over that area ( as extracted from the internal sdss operational database ) , all of the spectroscopic results ( as output from specbs ) , and , most significantly , a description of the angular window function of the survey and the flux and surface brightness limits used for galaxies in each area of the sky . for most of the area , the same version of the image analysis software used to create the spectroscopic target list was used in this sample . however , for the area covered by the early data release ( edr ; @xcite ) we used the version of the analysis software used for that data release , since it was substantially better than the early versions of the software used to target that area . for photo , the most important piece of analysis software run on the data , the versions used for the photometry range from v5_0 to v5_2 .",
    "the region covered by this sample is similar to , but not exactly , the region which will be released in the sdss data release 1 ( dr1 ) , scheduled for january 2003 ( which will use photo v5_3 , a newer version of the software which among other things improves the handling of large galaxies ) .",
    "figure [ pie.sample10 ] shows the distribution in right ascension and redshift of main sample galaxies with redshifts in sample10 within 6@xmath72 of the equator .",
    "figure [ lb.sample10 ] shows the distribution of main sample galaxies with redshifts on the sky in galactic coordinates .",
    "we measure galaxy magnitudes through a set of bandpasses which is obviously constant in the observer frame .",
    "this set of observer frame magnitudes corresponds to a different set of rest - frame magnitudes depending on the galaxy redshift . in order to compare galaxies observed at different redshifts , we convert all the magnitudes to a single fixed set of bandpasses . to perform this conversion ,",
    "we use the method of @xcite ( kcorrect v1_11 ) .",
    "these routines fit a linear combination of four spectral templates to each set of five magnitudes , assigning coefficients @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath75 to the first template is an estimate of the flux in the optical range ( @xmath79 ) in ergs s@xmath33 @xmath80 ; the fractional contribution of the other coefficients @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 characterize the spectral energy distribution of the galaxy .",
    "the most significant variation is along @xmath83 . taking the sum of the templates and projecting it onto filter responses",
    ", we can calculate the @xmath29-corrections from the observed bandpass to any rest - frame bandpass . in order to minimize the uncertainties in the @xmath29-correction",
    ", we choose a fixed set of bandpasses blueshifted by @xmath0 in order that they cover the same region of the rest - frame spectrum as do the observed bandpasses for a galaxy at @xmath0 ( chosen because it is near the median redshift of the sample ) .",
    "the bottom panel figure [ response ] shows this set of shifted bandpasses in the sdss ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) ) ; the top panel shows the more commonly used unshifted restframe bandpasses , measurements of which are more poorly constrained by our set of data .    for this paper , rather than using the full freedom of all four templates ,",
    "we instead use @xmath29-corrections from a restricted set of models .",
    "we fix @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( near the mean of the galaxy distribution in coefficient space ) .",
    "in addition , after fitting for @xmath83 we restrict that ratio to be one of the twelve values .",
    "figure [ kcorrect ] shows the @xmath29-corrections in each band as a function of redshift for each of these twelve values .",
    "the reason to restrict the @xmath29-correction this way is to make the likelihood evaluation more efficient , as described in @xcite . we have tested the effect of this approximation on our fit for the luminosity function by taking a smaller set of values ( six ) , finding no significant differences .",
    "furthermore , if we consider the residuals of the restricted @xmath29-corrections in figure [ kcorrect ] to the @xmath29-corrections found using all four templates , there is no trend with redshift and the standard deviations of the differences are 0.03 mags at most ( for the @xmath35 band ; the value is much less for the other bands ) .    from this sample ,",
    "we create one subsample for each band , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , of galaxies satisfying the apparent magnitude and redshift limits listed in table [ limits ] .",
    "we chose the same apparent magnitude limits for the bands other than @xmath37 as @xcite chose ; that paper chose the limits by imposing the requirement that @xmath86 of galaxies brighter than the flux limit in the given band are fainter than @xmath87 . by defining a separate magnitude - limited sample in each band ,",
    "we avoid biasing our results in one band due to the fact that the galaxies were selected in another band ( for example , if we calculated the luminosity function in the @xmath35 band from a sample limited in the @xmath37 band , all of the faintest @xmath35 band galaxies would tend to be red galaxies ) . for each band",
    "we include essentially all observed absolute magnitudes in our samples .",
    "however , we of course do not have good constraints at all absolute magnitudes ; for this reason , we consider our model applicable only to a smaller range of evolution - corrected absolute magnitudes , which we define from the tenth least luminous object to the most luminous object .",
    "these absolute magnitude limits are also listed in table [ limits ] .",
    "in this section , we describe how to recover the number density of galaxies @xmath88 as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath89 and redshift @xmath39 , which we will use to calculate the luminosity density at @xmath0 .",
    "each galaxy has a measured magnitude in each band @xmath90 , an associated uncertainty @xmath91 , and a redshift @xmath39 .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath92 may be constructed from the apparent magnitude @xmath93 and redshift @xmath39 as follows @xmath94 where as written @xmath95 is the distance modulus as determined from the redshift assuming a particular cosmology ( for example , using the formulae compiled by @xcite ) and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath96 is the @xmath29-correction from the @xmath37 band of a galaxy at redshift @xmath39 to the @xmath3 band .    in order to fit the distribution of the absolute magnitudes and redshifts of galaxies ,",
    "we use a maximum likelihood method which allows for a generic luminosity function shape ( it does not assume a schechter function or any other simple form ) , allows for simple luminosity and number evolution , and accounts for the estimated uncertainties in the galaxy fluxes .",
    "the method is described in detail by @xcite , and we outline it briefly here .",
    "it is akin to the stepwise maximum likelihood ( swml ) method of @xcite .",
    "however , it includes evolution in our model for the luminosity function , it accounts for the effects of flux uncertainties , and ( for computational convenience ) it uses gaussian basis functions rather than top hat basis functions .",
    "in addition , rather than maximizing the likelihood of absolute magnitude given redshift , it maximizes the joint likelihood of absolute magnitude _ and _ redshift .",
    "this choice makes our estimates more sensitive to large - scale structure in the sample , and more sensitive to evolution .",
    "our model for the luminosity - redshift function is @xmath97 , \\ ] ] where the @xmath98 are fixed to be equally spaced in absolute magnitude and represent the centers of gaussians of width @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath100 are adjustable parameters signifying the amplitudes of the gaussians .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath101 represents the evolution in luminosity , in units of magnitude per unit redshift ; @xmath102 indicates that galaxies were more luminous in the past .",
    "@xmath103 quantifies the change in the number density with redshift ; we choose this particular parametrization ( again following @xcite ) such that @xmath103 represents the contribution of number density evolution to the evolution in the luminosity density in units of magnitudes .",
    "@xmath103 can be interpreted as either due to true evolution in the number density or due to very large scale structure .",
    "given the size of our data set and its relative shallowness , we can not distinguish between these possibilities ; when necessary to , we will interpret @xmath103 only as large - scale structure . in any case ,",
    "our main interest in this paper is the luminosity density at @xmath0 , not its evolution , and the luminosity density is insensitive to reasonable values of @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath104 is the zeropoint redshift , with respect to which we measure the evolution ; for this sample , we choose @xmath105 , the median redshift , since it is at that redshift that we can observe galaxies in the luminosity range around @xmath106 , which contribute the most to the luminosity density",
    ".    in principle we can include large - scale structure in the radial direction , @xmath107 , explicitly in the model , with the constraint that it have a reasonable power spectrum ( since the power in the density field is constrained mostly by modes which are not purely radial ) .",
    "however , we have decided not to do so here because it is not necessary for our goals .",
    "as described in @xcite , we fit model parameters by maximizing the likelihood of the model parameters given the data : @xmath108 we assume a uniform prior distribution of @xmath109 , @xmath101 , and @xmath103 ( thus guaranteeing that @xmath100 is positive ) .",
    "because @xmath110 obviously does not depend on the model parameters , the problem reduces to minimizing @xmath111 we construct the likelihood @xmath112 of each galaxy @xmath38 by convolving the luminosity function with a gaussian of width @xmath91 ( the estimated apparent magnitude uncertainty defined above ) and constraining the galaxies to satisfy the flux limits of the survey : @xmath113    the number of parameters required for this fit ( @xmath114@xmath115 ) is small enough that standard function minimizers can handle the task in a reasonable amount of time ( one hour ) on modern workstations ( in our case , a 2 ghz pentium iv machine ) , for a sample of @xmath116 objects . in the fit , we constrain the integral of @xmath117 to be unity over our range of absolute magnitude ( as listed in table [ limits ] for each band ) .",
    "the overall normalization @xmath118 can not be determined from this likelihood maximization procedure .",
    "we use the standard minimum variance estimator of @xcite to perform the normalization . @xmath119 where the integral is over the volume covered by the survey between the minimum and maximum redshifts used for our estimate .",
    "the weight for each galaxy is @xmath120 and the selection function is @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the galaxy sampling rate determined at each position of sky as the fraction of targets in each sector that were successfully assigned a classification .",
    "the integral of the correlation function is : @xmath123 clearly , because @xmath118 appears in the weight @xmath124 , it must be determined iteratively , which we do using the simple estimator @xmath125 as an initial guess .    to determine the uncertainties in our fit , we use thirty jackknife resamplings of the data . in each sampling",
    ", we omit @xmath126 of the effective area of sky ( meaning , the area weighted by the sampling rate @xmath122 ) .",
    "each omitted area is a nearly contiguous set of sectors .",
    "this jackknife resampling procedure thus includes , to the extent possible , the uncertainties due to large - scale structure and calibration errors across the survey .",
    "effectively , it includes the effects of errors which are correlated with angular position on the largest scales . taking the results of all thirty fits to the data",
    ", we calculate the covariance between all of our measured parameters using the standard formula @xmath127 the uncertainty correlation matrix is then defined in the standard way : @xmath128 .",
    "we are not interested in the uncertainty correlations between the amplitudes of each gaussian , because obviously neighboring gaussians will be highly covariant . for this paper",
    ", we will not even be interested in the covariances between overall amplitude at different luminosities of the luminosity function calculated from the sum of the gaussians .",
    "however , we will list in tables the covariances between the luminosity density , the evolution parameters , and overall measures of the shape , such as @xmath106 and @xmath129 for the best fit schechter function of each luminosity function .",
    "it is also important to track the covariances among the luminosity densities in all of the bands ; because large - scale structure is an important source of uncertainty , the luminosity densities are highly covariant , and ignoring this covariance would lead to overconfidence in any fit to the stellar density in galaxies based on this data ( and _ underconfidence _ in our knowledge of the relative luminosity density in different bands ) .",
    "note that the true uncertainties in the luminosity density may be dominated by the uncertainties in the overall photometric calibration or by the fraction of flux contained within the petrosian aperture for the galaxies that contribute to the luminosity density , while the uncertainties in the level of evolution recovered may be dominated by possible systematic errors in the @xmath29-corrections , as well as a systematic dependence of the fraction of light contained within a petrosian magnitude as a function of redshift ( due to the effects of seeing ) .",
    "we have applied the procedure described in the section [ method ] to the data described in section [ data ] .",
    "our results are summarized in this section .",
    "figures [ lfr ] and [ lfugiz ] show the galaxy luminosity function in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 bands , assuming @xmath130 and @xmath17 .",
    "the thick black line shows our best fit luminosity function .",
    "the thin black lines show the gaussians which sum to form the full luminosity function .",
    "the grey region surrounding the thick black line indicates the 1@xmath131 uncertainties in the luminosity function  of course , these uncertainties are all correlated with one another , and are closer to representing the uncertainties in the overall normalization of the function than the individual uncertainties at each magnitude .",
    "the best - fit @xmath101 and @xmath103 evolution parameters are listed in the figure .",
    "we have taken the thick black lines and their uncertainties and fit a schechter function to each curve .",
    "the dotted lines in figures [ lfr ] and [ lfugiz ] represent the best fit schechter functions , which provide a reasonable fit to our non - parametric results .",
    "the luminosity density we list in the figure , expressed as the absolute magnitude from galaxies in an @xmath132 mpc@xmath8 on average , is the result of integrating this schechter function fit over all luminosities .",
    "the values associated with the schechter function are listed in table [ schtable ] .",
    "we list results for the ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) and ( @xmath130 , @xmath134 ) cosmologies as well .",
    "we have found that to an accuracy of about 3% , we can convert the results of one cosmology to those of another by scaling @xmath135 by the inverse ratio of the comoving volumes at @xmath0 between the two cosmologies , and by scaling @xmath106 by the difference of the distance moduli at @xmath0 for the two cosmologies .",
    "we therefore recommend this procedure for readers interested in comparing our results to those in some other cosmological model .",
    "table [ lftable ] lists some salient quantitative measurements of the luminosity function in each band , including the evolution parameters and the luminosity density ( expressed in magnitudes , solar luminosities , and flux at the effective filter wavelength ) for a mpc@xmath8 . to obtain the physical expressions of the luminosity density",
    ", we used measurements of the sdss camera response performed by mamoru doi , which james gunn combined with estimates of the atmospheric extinction as a function of wavelength at @xmath136 airmasses ( to which all sdss observations are calibrated ) and the primary and secondary mirror reflectivities .",
    "projecting the solar model of @xcite onto these bandpasses ( shifted to @xmath0 ) yields the absolute solar ab magnitudes : @xmath137 the luminosity densities expressed in ergs s@xmath33 @xmath33 are calculated from the ab magnitudes as follows .",
    "first , we use the equation which relates an ab magnitude to the effective flux density at the effective wavelength , @xmath138 to convert the absolute magnitudes in an @xmath132 mpc@xmath8 to the flux density which would be observed if an average @xmath132 mpc@xmath8 of the universe were compressed to a point source and placed 10 pc distant from the observer .",
    "second , we multiply this value by @xmath139 to obtain the average luminosity per unit wavelength at the effective wavelength in an @xmath132 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "the `` effective wavelength '' of a passband with a quantum efficiency @xmath140 is defined : @xmath141,\\ ] ] following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the effective flux density defined above is that which an ab standard source ( @xmath142 ) of magnitude @xmath90 in passband @xmath143 would have at the effective wavelength . both of these quantities are obviously only nominal since , in any case , the average spectrum of galaxies is nothing like an ab standard source , but it does give a sense of the physical flux associated with a magnitude .",
    "we also list @xmath144 , the fraction of the integrated luminosity density of the schechter luminosity function included in the non - parametric estimate of the luminosity density .",
    "results for the cosmologies ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 ) and ( @xmath147 , @xmath146 ) are also listed .",
    "it is worth asking how well this model reproduces the number counts of galaxies as a function of redshift and absolute magnitude .",

    "the expectation from our model fit ( based on monte carlo realizations of the sample ) is shown as the thin histogram .",

    "the model appears to the eye to be a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "however , it is clear that there are statistically significant discrepancies in these figures ( note the large number of objects in each bin ) .",
    "some of these discrepancies occur because there is large - scale structure in the sample ; however , it is possible that we will need to introduce a more sophisticated model for the evolution of the galaxies or for the relationship between density and luminosity in order to explain all of these discrepancies . as discussed in the conclusions",
    ", we postpone the investigation of these issues to a later paper .",
    "as described above , we have quantified our uncertainties by taking 30 jacknife resamplings of the data . in tables",
    "[ ucorrtable][zcorrtable ] we display the resulting correlation matrices between various properties of our fit for each band .",
    "note that many of the parameters are highly correlated .",
    "in particular we note that @xmath106 and @xmath129 , which characterize the shape of the schechter luminosity function , are highly correlated .",
    "one should be cautious when quoting @xmath106 values as representative of the `` typical luminosity '' of a luminous galaxy .",
    "this statement is true to an extent , but not in detail .",
    "table [ fulljk ] displays the correlation matrix between the luminosity densities and evolution parameters @xmath101 in all of the bands .",
    "note that this matrix is entirely positive . in any particular resampling , if the luminosity density is slightly high in one band relative to the mean , all the bands are slightly high ; when one band evolves a bit more strongly , so do they all .",
    "this correlation occurs because our errors are dominated by large - scale structure , which affects all the bands simultaneously .",
    "these correlations are strong , so it is important to account for this correlation matrix of uncertainties when using these results .",
    "the top panel of figure [ mdenq ] shows the luminosity density as a function of wavelength at @xmath0 using the results of all five bands .",
    "one product of our fit is @xmath101 , the evolution of the luminosity density .",
    "however , we caution that we have restricted our model such that galaxies of all luminosities evolve identically .",
    "this assumption is probably incorrect , because different galaxy types have different luminosity function and are expected to evolve in different ways ( since their differing colors obviously imply different star - formation histories ) .",
    "furthermore , our understanding of our photometric error model , particularly in @xmath35 and @xmath39 , is currently rather primitive .",
    "while we believe that the flaws in our model for the evolution do not greatly bias the main result of this paper , the luminosity function and luminosity density at @xmath0 , we do warn the reader that because of the deficiencies of our model the measured @xmath101 values might be biased .",
    "we show our results for the luminosity evolution , @xmath101 , and its uncertainties , in the bottom panel of figure [ mdenq ] , for all the bands .",
    "the @xmath11 band has very strong evolution ( @xmath148 ) , although with large uncertainties .",
    "the other bands all have @xmath149@xmath150 .",
    "the evolution in these bands is generally consistent with the evolution of a relatively old stellar population .",
    "however , we will consider fits to theoretical models more carefully in a separate paper , and draw no particular conclusions here .",
    "it is likely that these evolution results reflect the evolution of the more luminous galaxies in the sample , for two reasons .",
    "first , more luminous galaxies are observable over a larger redshift range .",
    "second , the low luminosity end of the luminosity function is nearly a power - law , which makes it more difficult to detect evolution .",
    "if @xmath101 traces the evolution of primarily the luminous galaxies , it might explain why the evolution in the @xmath11 band is unusually large ; the most luminous objects in the @xmath11 band are the blue , exponential profile objects , which we expect to evolve more rapidly than red , concentrated galaxies .    for the flat , @xmath151-dominated cosmology ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath15 bands have @xmath152 , though at low significance in the case of @xmath1 .",
    "we do not believe that @xmath103 reflects true number density evolution , which we regard as _ a priori _ unlikely , especially since the other bands have @xmath103 consistent with zero . instead @xmath103 probably is compensating for inaccuracies in some other aspect of our model . in the case of the @xmath1 band",
    "it may compensate for the fact that our model does not include large - scale structure . in the case of the @xmath5 band ,",
    "our error model could be insufficient , or the @xmath29-corrections might be incorrect ( though they are small in any case ) .",
    "thus , one _ might _ claim that the luminosity density evolution we measure should be @xmath153 ; however , we think it better to interpret a non - zero @xmath103 to reflect large - scale structure in the sample rather than true evolution . a more sophisticated approach would be to treat the problem in more detail by fitting for the radial large - scale structure simultaneously with the luminosity function .",
    "we note in passing that the differences in @xmath103 and @xmath101 between the flat , @xmath151-dominated cosmology and the other cosmologies are consistent with the differences in the redshift dependence of the luminosity distance and the differential comoving volume among these cosmologies .",
    "we do not regard the low value of @xmath103 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in the flat , @xmath151-dominated cosmology necessarily as evidence that that cosmological model is correct .",
    "one of the challenges in studying the luminosity function and its redshift dependence is that one must verify that one s measurements of galaxy luminosity are consistent as a function of redshift .",
    "that is , one must test whether observing an identical galaxy at different redshifts will yield the same fraction of the total independent of redshift .",
    "otherwise , systematic errors in the measurement of galaxy luminosities as a function of redshift could masquerade as evolution .",
    "several : w effects can yield artificial redshift dependence in one s determination of galaxy flux ( which is to say , redshift dependence which can not be accounted for using the distance modulus and the @xmath29-correction ) .",
    "first , the increased physical size corresponding to the angular psf width for galaxies at high redshift can change both the metric size ( in physical units at the galaxy ) of the aperture used to calculate the galaxy flux _ and _ the amount of light scattered outside of any particular aperture .",
    "second , color gradients in galaxies mean that the different radii in the galaxy profile @xmath29-correct differently",
    ". since in the sdss the size of the aperture is based on the shape of the profile , this effect can change the metric size of the aperture used to calculate the galaxy flux .",
    "third , cosmological surface brightness dimming can make the outermost measurable isophote have a smaller metric size .    because the sdss has high signal - to - noise ratio imaging and",
    "because it uses petrosian rather than isophotal magnitudes , the third effect is negligible .",
    "however , petrosian magnitudes are sensitive to some degree to seeing ; as an object becomes small with respect to the seeing width , the fraction of the total flux measured by the petrosian magnitudes tends to that fraction for a pure psf ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) . for the sdss ,",
    "the fraction of the total light in a pure psf measured by the petrosian magnitude is about 95% .",
    "thus , galaxies with exponential profiles will tend to have their measured fluxes reduced in the presence of bad seeing from the fraction of nearly 100% for the no - seeing case . on the other hand , galaxies with de vaucouleurs",
    "profiles will tend to have their measured fluxes increased from the fraction of only 82% for the no seeing case .",
    "furthermore , the apertures of the petrosian magnitudes are determined by the @xmath37-band image of the galaxy , which , while it is less sensitive to differential @xmath29-corrections than bluer bands , is still somewhat dependent on these effects .",
    "several methods exist for estimating what fraction of the flux is outside the sdss petrosian apertures .",
    "first , one could compare sdss imaging to deeper imaging .",
    "second , one could stack many sdss images of different galaxies but of similar types , and use the composite profile to characterize the fraction of light missing outside of a petrosian aperture .",
    "third , one can use a reasonable model for galaxy light profiles to extrapolate to a `` total '' flux for each object . here , we take the third approach , using the srsic  magnitudes described in section [ data ] as a seeing - corrected , `` total '' magnitude . in addition , because the srsic  fit is based on the @xmath38-band image , the issue of the @xmath29-correction of the galaxy profile is negligible ( as the @xmath29-corrections in the @xmath38-band are small ) for the redshifts considered in this paper .",
    "figure [ check_sersic ] shows the differences between srsic  and petrosian magnitudes in each band , as a function of srsic  index @xmath58 and redshift @xmath39 . clearly , the difference is sensitive to the srsicindex and is larger for galaxies which are similar to de vaucouleurs galaxies , in accordance with the estimates in @xcite of the fraction of flux included in the sdss petrosian magnitudes for different profile types . for @xmath35 and @xmath36 the srsic",
    "magnitude is significantly fainter than the petrosian magnitude at low srsicindex .",
    "this fact _ might _ reflect color gradients within exponential galaxies .",
    "the shape of the srsic  model we use is determined in the @xmath38-band ; if the effective size of the galaxy is larger in bluer bands , known to be the case for spiral galaxies , the flux determined by fitting the srsic  model amplitude will be smaller than the flux determined by counting the flux within an unweighted aperture .",
    "the right panel shows a linear regression versus redshift .",
    "the mean offset at @xmath0 ranges from 0.14 for the @xmath1 band to -0.14 for the @xmath5 band .",
    "again , this result suggests that the srsic  magnitude traces a redder population , perhaps as a consequence of color gradients in galaxies .    for our purposes here",
    ", we are interested primarily in the differences in the resulting luminosity density from srsic  magnitudes relative to petrosian magnitudes .",
    "when we fit luminosity functions to all five bands using the srsic  magnitudes , we obtain luminosity densities offset from the petrosian values as follows : @xmath154 the values of @xmath101 for srsic  magnitudes are consistent with the results for petrosian magnitudes .",
    "we caution that the estimates of the luminosity density using srsic  magnitudes are not necessarily more correct than the estimates from petrosian magnitudes ; because the srsic  profile is not a perfect fit to the observed radial profiles of galaxies , there is likely to be a bias in the resulting estimates of luminosity density associated with srsic  magnitudes",
    ". however , the small differences in equation ( [ sersicdiff ] ) suggest that the differences are also small between either of these estimates and the luminosity density we would derive using true `` total '' magnitudes .",
    "in order to compare our results to those of other investigators , we have used the routines in kcorrect v1_14 ( a slight update on the version kcorrect v1_11 used elsewhere in this paper and in @xcite ) to fit the sed of the universe and derive the luminosity densities in other bands . in particular , we list in table [ kuniv ] results for the unshifted sdss bandpasses for comparison to @xcite , for the unshifted @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath143 and @xmath157 johnson bandpasses ( using the responses listed by @xcite ) , and for @xmath158 for comparison to 2dfgrs . to create the @xmath158 result we applied the equation @xmath159 to the results in the johnson bandpasses , originally from @xcite .",
    "we derive these luminosity densities both at @xmath0 and ( by using @xmath101 to evolve the sdss results ) @xmath160 . for comparison ,",
    "we show in the same table the results of @xcite and @xcite . for the @xcite we use the mean evolutionary correction from their figure 8 to evaluate a luminosity density at @xmath0 .",
    "there is only 0.09 magnitude difference between our result in @xmath158 at @xmath0 and theirs ; this difference is less than 1@xmath131 taking into account the 2dfgrs statistical uncertainties .",
    "the results of table [ kuniv ] reflect a general agreement between these different determinations of the luminosity function .",
    "in contrast to these results , @xcite reported a higher luminosity density than found in other surveys , such as the 2dfgrs results of @xcite and the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; @xcite ) results of @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite found that the @xmath161-band luminosity function of @xcite overpredicted the number counts of galaxies found in the millenium galaxy catalog .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out by @xcite , the luminosity density in the @xmath162-band reported by @xcite was unreasonably high relative to the luminosity density found by @xcite in @xmath163 and @xmath164 . while our luminosity density is still considerably higher than that found by the lcrs , we no longer disagree significantly with 2dfgrs .",
    "naturally , the question arises as to why the discrepancy existed in the first place .",
    "table [ kuniv ] makes clear that there are large differences between our present results and those of @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize here that if we apply the same methods used in that paper to our current sample , the results are within 1@xmath131 of the results in that paper .",
    "this change in the luminosity density estimates are not due to statistical fluctuations , nor to a change in the photometric calibration , but are instead due to improvements in our model for the luminosity function and the observations .",
    "in particular , we are using a better estimate of the @xmath29-corrections and we are including evolution in our model for the luminosity function .",
    "the largest changes are the luminosity densities in the @xmath165 and @xmath166 bands ( which are 1.2 and 0.75 magnitudes less luminous respectively ) , where the changes in the @xmath29-corrections were largest _ and _ where evolution is most important .",
    "ignoring evolution in the luminosity function model causes a large bias in the estimate of the luminosity density , because it causes the expected number of objects at high redshift to be inaccurate .",
    "if galaxies in fact are brighter in the past , a non - evolving model tends to yield lower number counts at high redshift , at a given normalization . since the normalization procedure of @xcite weights according to volume , and thus accords higher weight at higher redshift , in this case a non - evolving model would result in an overestimate of galaxies at low redshift . due to bad luck , the systematics comparison of figure 8 in that paper , which compared the normalizations of the luminosity function at high and low redshift , happened not to reveal this effect , presumably due to the large supercluster at @xmath167 in those data ( and still distinctly visible in figure [ zhist ] in this , much larger , dataset ! ) .",
    "figures [ zhist][zqa ] in the present paper show decisively that our current model explains the redshift counts very well .",
    "so how does this affect our comparisons to other surveys ?",
    "for the lcrs , whose method of fitting the luminosity function and its normalization was identical to that of @xcite , the original comparison remains the fair one . that is , even though our estimate of the luminosity density is now only @xmath168 magnitudes brighter than that of @xcite , this is only an accident , resulting from a combination of two effects in the lcrs : using bright isophotal magnitudes , which lowers the luminosity density estimate , and ignoring ( as @xcite also did ) evolution , which raises the luminosity density estimate .",
    "for 2mass , the change in our result makes the sdss more compatible with the results of @xcite .",
    "however , it is more difficult to directly compare these surveys , since the sdss bands and 2mass bands do not overlap .    for the 2dfgrs , @xcite report a luminosity density of @xmath169 absolute magnitudes at @xmath160 ( integrating the schechter function for the @xmath130 , @xmath17 cosmology in the first line of their table 2 over all luminosities ) .",
    "this result is based on extrapolating to @xmath160 the luminosities of galaxies whose typical redshifts are @xmath170@xmath168 , using assumptions about the luminosity evolution .",
    "figure 8 of @xcite , which shows the mean @xmath29-correction and evolution correction used in their analysis , shows that their evolution correction corresponds closely to @xmath171 .",
    "since we find a somewhat different value of @xmath172 at these wavelengths , and both surveys have similar median redshifts , the fair comparison of the luminosity densities involves evaluating the luminosity density at around @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason , we evolution - correct their results back to @xmath0 by applying @xmath173 .",
    "thus , for 2dfgrs @xmath174 , within 1@xmath131 of our result in table [ kuniv ] . note that if we instead compare our @xmath160 value of the @xmath158 luminosity density to theirs , the discrepancy is about 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "however , in either comparison the differences between the sdss and 2dfgrs luminosity densities are rather small .",
    "we find similarly small differences between our results and the galaxy counts data from the millenium galaxy catalog of @xcite .",
    "our schechter function model for the @xmath2-band luminosity function , crudely transformed into @xmath175 bandpass by applying @xmath176 to @xmath106 , and using @xmath177 as for @xmath12 , nicely predicts their galaxy counts to @xmath178 to within about 5% .    the original @xcite 2dfgrs result that @xcite compared to did not evolution - correct their magnitudes either .",
    "so why was there a discrepancy between those two results ?",
    "first of all , as @xcite have pointed out , the linear transformation used by @xcite to convert sdss magnitudes to 2dfgrs magnitudes ( which was based on the linear transformation between @xmath158 and @xmath155 and @xmath156 published by @xcite ) was inappropriate .",
    "using the @xcite transformation from @xmath155 and @xmath156 to @xmath158 ( @xmath179 ) instead results in a 10% reduction in the luminosity density , not enough to explain the original discrepancy .",
    "however , one significant difference between @xcite and the mock @xmath158 luminosity function in @xcite was that @xcite normalized to the number counts instead of using a volume - weighted method . due to this normalization ,",
    "the @xcite result was less affected by luminosity evolution , because their normalization was set by galaxies close to the median redshift of the survey , rather than those at the distant edge of the survey .",
    "this difference seems to account for the bulk of the discrepancy between @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite reach the same conclusion . as stated above , comparison of our results to those of @xcite , who perform an evolution correction to their magnitudes , now results in a consistent measurement of the luminosity density .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite did show that the isophotal magnitudes meaured by the apm survey did not include a significant fraction of the flux for a typical galaxy , and further that the `` gaussian - correction '' to total magnitudes ( described in detail by @xcite ) performed on the galaxy fluxes were insufficient to replace this difference .",
    "if this were the whole story , there should remain a difference of roughly 30% between the @xcite results based on 2dfgrs magnitudes and the results presented here , based on sdss petrosian magnitudes .",
    "however , extensive further calibration of the plate magnitudes has been performed using deep ccd imaging , as described by @xcite . in effect , the overall calibration of the galaxy survey is set by a comparison between observations of a set of galaxies using the apm and using deep ccd imaging . since the magnitudes in the deep ccd imaging count flux outside the limiting isophotes of the apm magnitudes , this overall calibration translates the isophotal to total magnitudes ( on average , that is  naturally , for any particular galaxy the correction depends on the profile shape and size of that galaxy ) .",
    "for this reason , the comparisons in @xcite of 2dfgrs magnitudes and sdss magnitudes agree on average , for galaxies near the median surface brightness ( although there is a strong correlation of the residuals with surface brightness ) .",
    "@xcite did not account for these extra step of calibration and isophotal - to - total correction , and so overestimated the effect of the different magnitude definitions in the final luminosity density .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have suggested that the results of @xcite could have been biased high due to large - scale structure .",
    "this possibility can be ruled out by simply using the same methods used by that paper on the full sample presented here .",
    "the luminosity density so calculated is within @xmath180 of the original result , suggesting that the 10% uncertainties calculated for that sample were realistic .",
    "this agreement occurs despite the fact that the galaxy counts for @xmath181 in the region used by @xcite are 1015% higher than in the survey on average . as correctly pointed out by @xcite , the statistical uncertainties in the normalization are much smaller when using the volume - weighting method of @xcite , rather than the normalizing to galaxy counts , though as those authors state one is more susceptible to systematic errors in the model for evolution . using the luminosity function model in this paper , normalizing either way yields nearly identical results ;",
    "for example , consider the counts predicted by the models listed in figures [ uqa][zqa ] .",
    "the possible exception is the @xmath35-band , for which there is a 10% difference ( still within the @xmath180 statistical uncertainties ) .",
    "again , we emphasize that the differences between the luminosity function derived here and in @xcite are a product primarily of the model of the luminosity function we use .    in short ,",
    "the discrepancies between sdss and 2dfgrs appear to be resolved , for the most part due to a proper treatment of evolution in the sdss luminosity function .",
    "it remains to be determined whether the results of sdss and 2mass are discrepant , but in any case they are ameliorated by the reduction of our estimate of the luminosity density .",
    "figure [ mdenq ] plots the luminosity density versus wavelength using equation ( [ fluxeq ] ) for the sdss ( diamonds ) . using the above results",
    ", we add the 2dfgrs point from @xcite ( triangle ) , and the 2mass points from @xcite ( crosses ) , as described in this section .",
    "for the 2dfgrs , translating the luminosity density expressed in magnitudes into physical units is a nontrivial endeavour .",
    "the zeropoint of the 2dfgrs @xmath158 system is set by the equation : @xmath182 although this slope was determined by @xcite based only on a small set of stars , it can be checked _ a posteriori _ against ccd observations which are appropriately converted from their natural system into the johnson @xmath155 and @xmath156 system . according to @xcite ,",
    "such observations confirm the slope @xmath183 to a surprising degree of accuracy given the estimated errors of @xcite .",
    "however , the typical galaxy used to perform this check is not anywhere near @xmath184 , and because we expect the relationship between any set of bandpasses to be nonlinear ( with or without photographic plate nonlinearities ) , it is not guaranteed that @xmath158 , as zeropointed using equation ( [ bjeq ] , is a vega - relative magnitude .",
    "we perform a test of equation ( [ bjeq ] ) using an estimate of the spectral response of the plates , from hewett & warren ( private communication ) , who have determined the response for one plate by dispersing a spectrum ( with well - measured @xmath185 from spectrophotometry ) through 2 mm of gg395 filter and onto kodak iiiaj emulsion , the definition of the @xmath158 bandpass . using the nominal @xmath155 and @xmath156 responses derived by @xcite and typical galaxy spectra at @xmath160 , we find that the relationship between @xmath158 and @xmath155 around a typical galaxy color of @xmath186 is close to @xmath187 .",
    "the relationship is indeed nonlinear and appears to cross @xmath188 at @xmath184 .",
    "again , if this difference existed in the 2dfgrs data , it would never be noticed because the zeropoint is explicitly set using ccd imaging of galaxies assuming equation ( [ bjeq ] ) holds at typical galaxy colors . on the other hand ,",
    "the curve given to us by hewett & warren is based only on measurements of a single plate , whose response may not be typical of the plates in the apm . given this uncertainty , we simply assume hewett & warren are correct , and derive an ab magnitude from 2dfgrs @xmath158 magnitudes : @xmath189 which we claim is uncertain at the 0.05 mag level",
    ". then we can use equation ( [ fluxeq ] ) to calculate the luminosity density in physical units .    in the near infrared , the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass )",
    "results of @xcite for the @xmath163 and @xmath190 bands are shown .",
    "we use the published responses of @xmath191 and @xmath192 from the 2mass website and the @xcite theoretical vega spectrum ( normalized at 5000   to match the @xcite spectrophotometry of vega ) to calculate zeropoint shifts from vega to ab magnitudes of ( @xmath193 , @xmath194 ) for @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath191 band ab zeropoint corresponds closely with that listed in the 2mass explanatory supplement section iv.5.a .",
    "however , the @xmath192 band ab zeropoint listed there is about 1.77 ; since the spectrophotometry or model used to calculate this zeropoint is not specified on that site , we can not determine the source of this discrepancy .",
    "however , the difference is within the 1@xmath131 statistical uncertainties of @xcite .",
    "to evolution - correct the 2mass luminosity densities to @xmath0 , we assume @xmath171 , which is consistent with most stellar population synthesis models .",
    "we display this in figure [ mdenq ] as crosses .",
    "we should note here that although we have done our best here to place all the observations on the same physical footing , absolute calibration of this sort is uncertain .",
    "no spectrophotometry we know of has been performed to verify the models of @xcite in the infrared , which we rely on to put the 2mass results in physical units in figure [ mdenq ] .",
    "there are uncertainties of at least 5% percent in the spectrophotometric calibration of bd+17 4708 , the primary standard used to calibrate the sdss . in any of the observations",
    "there is uncertainty and quite possibly variability in the bandpass responses .",
    "so this plot ( and any plot like it in the literature ) should not be trusted to better than 5% ( which can be enough to substantially change one s theoretical interpretation of the observations in terms of a star - formation history ) .",
    "we leave until a later paper or to other authors a serious attempt to reconcile these various observations given a star - formation history and stellar population synthesis models .",
    "we have presented the galaxy luminosity density across the optical range , and have shown that it is consistent with other determinations .",
    "previous differences found between the sdss and other surveys are primarily attributable to the effect of luminosity evolution on our results .",
    "we have accounted for luminosity evolution in our current fits , and have given our results , which appear loosely consistent with the predictions of passive evolution in most bands .",
    "our results are similar to those found by @xcite for their sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "we note that our results are in general agreement with the shape of the cosmic spectrum determined from the 2dfgrs and sdss galaxy spectra by @xcite and glazebrook et al .",
    ", in preparation . in the case of sdss spectra , glazebrook et al .",
    "use the same data as used here ( petrosian magnitudes in sample10 ) to apply an overall normalization to their spectrum , but use the @xmath195 diameter fiber spectra ( which typically contain about 20% of the petrosian galaxy flux and cover regions of the galaxy about 0.1 mag redder in @xmath196 than that covered by the petrosian aperture ) to find the luminosity density as a function of wavelength .",
    "the power of their approach is that the emission and absorption lines contain more detailed information on the star - formation history than do broad - band colors ; the question remains whether this star - formation history is representative of the global star - formation history",
    ".    we will continue to improve our estimates of evolution .",
    "first , we will quantify our uncertainties in flux measurements more robustly and understand how our estimates of magnitude are affected by seeing in more detail .",
    "doing so will yield more reliable estimates of luminosity evolution .",
    "second , different galaxy types are expected to evolve differently ; redder galaxies are generally presumed to be older and thus more slowly evolving .",
    "the different evolution of different galaxy types can constrain theories of the formation of galaxies , and thus it is of interest to study this differential evolution . furthermore , it is well known that different galaxy types have different luminosity functions ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) ; thus , it is probable that the shape of the galaxy luminosity function evolves , not merely its overall luminosity scale .",
    "one caveat to our results is the existence of surface - brightness selection effects .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that if the sdss can truly detect most of the objects which exist down to @xmath197 , not much luminosity density ( @xmath198 ) can exist at lower surface brightnesses , unless the dependence of luminosity on surface brightness flattens dramatically below these limits or there is a sharp upturn in the luminosity function at low luminosities .",
    "@xcite demonstrated similar results for 2dfgrs .",
    "this result is not necessarily inconsistent with the results of @xcite , who found that the number density of galaxies does not decline at low surface brightnesses ; however , if the relationship between luminosity and surface brightness measured in the sdss exists in their galaxy sample , the contribution to the luminosity density of galaxies should decline considerably at low surface brightness . unfortunately , that paper and its predecessors do not evaluate the luminosity density contributed by different ranges of surface brightness in their sample",
    "the possibility remains that the sdss is very incomplete at @xmath199 .",
    "such incompleteness would probably not be due to low signal - to - noise ( see the order - of - magnitude calculation in @xcite ) ; it would more likely be due to systematic difficulties in subtracting the sky background .",
    "we find no evidence for changes in the measured extinction - corrected surface - brightness distribution at galactic extinctions varying from 0 to nearly 2 in the @xmath37-band ( as determined by @xcite ) , which indicates that the surface brightnesses of most galaxies in the survey are not close to the surface brightness limit of the survey .",
    "in fact , there are a number of `` objects '' detected at low surface brightness @xmath200 , nearly all of which turn out to be scattered light or other image defects ; thus , such low surface brightness features are readily detectable .",
    "we can test these effects more thoroughly by searching for simulated galaxies inserted into actual data , and such tests are currently ongoing .    these results ( and the accompanying covariance matrices ) can be used to constrain aspects of the star - formation history of the universe , and in particular the overall stellar density .",
    "in addition , they can be used to develop a selection function for flux - limited galaxy redshift surveys selected from the sdss .",
    "they also provide the state - of - the - art luminosity densities with which to calculate @xmath201 using measured mass - to - light ratios .",
    "finally , they can be compared to high redshift estimates of luminosity density in order to evaluate the evolution of galaxies to high redshift .",
