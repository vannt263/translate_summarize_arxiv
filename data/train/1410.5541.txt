    "stars form from molecular clouds in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , especially giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ( mckee & ostriker 2007 [ mo07 ] ; tan et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the rate of star formation appears to be relatively inefficient compared to that derived from collapse of the clouds at the free - fall rate ( zuckermann & evans 1974 ; krumholz & tan 2007 ) .",
    "part of the reason for this may be the high degree of clustering of star formation within gmcs in regions with @xmath3  mag ( lada et al . 2010",
    "; heiderman et al . 2010 ; gutermuth et al . 2011 ) .",
    "studying the formation of the dense substructures within molecular clouds is thus crucial for a more complete understanding of the star formation process .",
    "observationally , these dense substructures have been studied by : various molecular line tracers , such as @xmath4 ( e.g. , jackson et al . 2006 ) , @xmath5 ( e.g. , barnes et al . 2011 ) , and @xmath6 ( e.g. , henshaw et al .",
    "2013 ) ; sub - mm and mm dust continuum emission ( e.g. , rathborne et al . 2006 ; ginsburg et al .",
    "2012 ) ; and mid - infrared extinction ( e.g. , butler & tan 2009 , 2012 ; peretto & fuller 2009 ) of infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) .",
    "theoretically , we expect gravitational collapse within molecular clouds to be mediated by support from some combination of turbulence , magnetic fields and stellar feedback ( mo07 ) .",
    "some examples of recent work studying dense gas formation include set - ups of internal gmc converging flows ( chen & ostriker 2014 ) , global turbulent clouds ( smith et al . 2014 ) , periodic box turbulence ( moeckel & burkert 2014 ) , and formation of gmcs from converging atomic flows ( heitsch et al . 2009 ; gomez & vzquez - semadeni 2014 ) .",
    "our approach differs from these previous studies by setting the boundary conditions for gmcs from a galactic environment affected by global galactic dynamics .",
    "tasker & tan ( 2009 , hereafter tt09 ) carried out hydrodynamic simulations of an idealized axisymmetric , flat rotation curve galaxy to resolve the formation and interaction of gmcs ( see also dobbs 2008 ; bournaud et al .",
    "2010 ; renaud et al .",
    "their mutual interactions lead to a supersonic velocity dispersion of the clouds and frequent collisions that drive turbulence in the gas . in order to understand",
    "the star formation process within molecular clouds , a significant range of the cloud s internal structure then needs to be resolved , ranging from the gmc - scale down to the @xmath7  pc scale clumps thought to represent the initial conditions of star cluster formation .",
    "van loo et al . ( 2013 , hereafter paper i ) followed a 1 kiloparsec - square patch of the tt09 disk ( extended vertically for @xmath8  kpc ) down to a resolution of 0.5  pc for a period of 10  myr .",
    "star formation was introduced in gas above a threshold `` clump '' density of @xmath9 and at a star formation efficiency per local free - fall time of @xmath10 .",
    "the star particles created , with a minimum mass of 100  @xmath11 representing clusters or subclusters of stars , were prevented from accreting additional gas . nor was local feedback from these star particles implemented . in spite of the relatively low value of @xmath12 , the overall sfr seen in",
    "the simulation was much , @xmath13 times , larger than in observed galaxies with similar total mass surface densities of gas ( e.g. , bigiel et al .",
    "this was due in part to the much higher mass fractions of gas at `` gmc '' and `` clump '' densities than in real galaxies : about 70% of the gas was within `` gmcs '' ( at @xmath14 ) , and of this about 50% was also above the clump threshold density . in paper",
    "i , we speculated that inclusion of magnetic fields and/or local feedback from young stars is needed to resolve this discrepancy .    in van loo , tan & falle ( 2015 , paper ii ) we presented an initial study of the effects of magnetic fields of various strengths on the same kpc - scale patch of the galactic disk , finding modest levels of global suppression of star formation rates by up to factors of two .",
    "however , this result was strongly influenced by the presence of a single magnetically supercritical starburst region in one part of the simulation domain , and larger suppression factors were seen in other regions .",
    "our goal in this paper , paper iii , is to follow the evolution of the gmcs and the formation of dense filaments and clumps to higher spatial resolution , @xmath15  pc .",
    "this is carried out with the same physics as modeled in paper i , namely pure hydrodynamics of self - gravitating gas ( magnetic fields at this resolution and stellar feedback are deferred to future papers ) .",
    "the rationale is to be able to carry out more detailed characterization of the stucture , kinematics and dynamics of forming dense gas structures for comparison with galactic irdcs , which , being at very early stages of their star formation , are probably relatively unaffected by local stellar feedback . our particular focus is on the properties of long , @xmath16  pc , filaments that form from the collapsing gmcs .",
    "we measure various properties of simulated filaments and compare to similarly long filaments , recently discovered , including as irdcs , in the galactic interstellar medium ( e.g. , jackson et al .",
    "2010 ; battersby & bally 2012 ; ragan et al .",
    "2014 ) .    these nonmagnetic , zero - feedback simulations should thus be regarded as a baseline calculations from which we can then determine how much , if any , suppression of collapse is needed from magnetic fields ( and stellar feedback ) to more accurately represent the observed structure and dynamics of dense , star - forming filaments and clumps .",
    "in  [ s : methods ] we describe our methods and numerical set - up . in ",
    "[ s : resultsa ] and  [ s : resultsb ] we describe our results . in  [ s : conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "for our initial conditions , we use the same 1 kpc@xmath17 patch ( @xmath18-@xmath19 coordinates describe location in the disk plane ) studied in paper i , that is centered at a galactocentric radius of 4.25  kpc ( the galactic center is 4.25  kpc away from the patch center in the negative @xmath18 direction and at the same @xmath19 value ) and extending to @xmath20  kpc , above and below the disk .",
    "this patch was extracted from the global galaxy simulation of tt09 after a time when the disk was largely fragmented into a population of gmcs ( see left column of figure  [ fig : boxsigma ] ) . as in paper",
    "i , the velocity field is transformed to the frame of the circular velocity of 200  km  s@xmath21 at the center of the box .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied at the @xmath22 faces of box and outflow boundary conditions at the other faces .",
    "a fixed background potential is applied to represent the vertical distribution of galactic stars and dark matter to match the potential used by tt09 .",
    "note , this set - up is not that of a shearing box ( e.g. , coriolis forces are neglected ) , but the effects of this approximation are expected to be quite small since the total time span that is followed is relatively short compared to a flow crossing time across the box .",
    "paper i followed the evolution of this region for 10  myr with a maximum resolution of 0.49  pc , but , to resolve structures on the scale of individual star - forming clumps , higher resolution is needed .",
    "the following simulations contain 6 levels of amr on top of the original 7.8  pc base grid resolution of the tt09 simulation .",
    "the maximum resolution is then 0.122  pc , i.e. , four times better than in paper i.    we include heating and cooling functions derived using the photodissociation code cloudy ( version 8 ; ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) , as in paper i. these functions are able to treat gas at temperatures as low as @xmath23  k ( and up to @xmath24  k and beyond ) .",
    "these functions include both atomic and molecular line cooling processes , including from h@xmath25 and co , among others .",
    "a table of heating and cooling rates for a range of densities and temperatures was generated based on the density versus mean extinction relationship derived in paper i. for temperatures above @xmath26  k , we opt to use the cooling curve of sarazin & white ( 1987 ) and set the heating rate to zero . for densities and temperatures above or below the limits of the table , we use the limiting rate . for more details on the derivation of this function ,",
    "see paper i.    since our focus is on the dense , molecular gas , we adopt a fixed mean particle mass of @xmath27  g , i.e. , assuming @xmath28 .",
    "thus the sound speed is @xmath29 , which implies an adiabatic sound speed @xmath30)^{1/2 } \\rightarrow 0.243 ( t/10\\:{\\rm    k})^{1/2}\\:{\\rm km\\:s^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "our use of this fixed value of @xmath31 means that the pressures of the regions of our simulation that correspond to atomic regions are smaller in our simulation by a factor of 1.83 than they would be in reality .",
    "we present the results of two separate simulation runs .",
    "the first run , run nsf , includes all the above processes at a maximum resolution of 0.122  pc . in the second run , run sf , we utilize a simple recipe for star formation , which converts a fixed percentage of gas mass per free - fall time into star particles if a cell exceeds a particular threshold density . we choose a value for the star formation efficiency per local free - fall time , @xmath32 ( krumholz & tan 2007 ) . as in paper",
    "i , we do not resolve individual star - forming cores , so no requirements for the gas to be converging or to be gravitationally bound are imposed .",
    "when a cell exceeds the threshold density , a star particle is formed whose mass is calculated by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the gas density , @xmath35 the cell volume , @xmath36 the numerical time step , and @xmath37 the free - fall time of gas in the cell ( evaluated as @xmath38 with a mean molecular weight of @xmath39 ) .",
    "we use a threshold density of @xmath40  @xmath41 and a minimum star particle mass of 10  @xmath42 . if @xmath43 , then a particle is formed stochastically with a probability @xmath44 . at the threshold density ,",
    "the minimum gas mass in the cell is @xmath45 .",
    "note that the threshold density is higher and minimum star particle mass smaller compared to paper i , because of the higher grid resolution .",
    "the star particles are treated as collisionless particles whose motions are governed by pure n - body calculations , and do not gain any mass once they are formed .",
    "the focus of this study is the collapse of gmcs to form filaments and the fragmentation of these filaments to form dense star - forming clumps .",
    "considering the time scales on which these processes occur , we run the simulations for 4  myr using the adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code _",
    "enzo 2.0 _ ( bryan et al . 2014 , oshea et al . 2004 ) . after this time",
    ", the clouds have undergone significant fragmentation and formed a large number of small pc - scale clumps in several filaments ( see figure  [ fig : boxsigma ] ) . in the run with star formation",
    "a large number of star particles has been created .",
    "the presence of a large number of dense gas and stellar structures makes continued calculation of the simulation very memory intensive , slow and inefficient . since",
    "continued evolution is not necessary for us to achieve our scientific goals of studying the initial stages of star formation and since other physics due star formation feedback is not yet included in these models , we do not attempt to follow the evolution beyond 4  myr .",
    "we note that the zeus solver ( stone & norman 1992 ) , rather than a godunov solver , has been used for these simulations .",
    "this introduces relatively large heating rates due to numerical viscosity , but makes the calculation more numerically stable .",
    "we have also carried out simulation runs at the 0.5  pc resolution with this same solver for comparison .",

    "the mean locations of the gmcs do not change much over this relatively short timespan , given the clouds initial simulation - frame @xmath18-@xmath19-plane velocities of @xmath48 that are a mixture of the shearing velocity field of galactic rotation and the peculiar motions imparted by gravitational scattering interactions from prior evolution in the tt09 simulation . note that these motions correspond to mach numbers of about 100 for gas that has been able to cool to @xmath49  k.    after 4  myr",
    ", the clouds are seen to have collapsed to form filamentary structures and more spheroidal clumps .",
    "the overall morphology of these gas structures is very similar between the nsf and sf runs .",
    "the main difference is seen in the peak @xmath1 values , with the sf run having lower values due to conversion of gas into star particles .",
    "the peak @xmath1 values as seen in the top - down projections are 1250 and 317 @xmath50 in the nsf and sf runs , respectively .",

    "we note that since ionizing photon , stellar wind and supernova feedback are not included , the global density and thermal structure of this simulated ism lacks the hot phase component and underrepresents the warm phase components .",
    "the total gas mass in run nsf is @xmath57 , while it falls by @xmath58 to @xmath59 in run sf after 4  myr due to star formation activity . as a consequence",
    "the mass in star particles grows to @xmath60 , composed of 1.82 @xmath61  particles , resulting in a mean star particle mass of 19.2  @xmath11 .",
    "this means that , contrary to paper i , not all star particles are formed stochastically at the minimum mass level .",
    "in fact , only a small percentage , 1.5% , has the minimum star particle mass of @xmath62 .",
    "the maximum star particle mass in our simulation is 289  @xmath63 .",
    "the average star formation rate per unit area during the 4.0  myr of the simulation is @xmath64 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , we compare the sfr time evolution of run sf to those of the 0.5  pc resolution runs including star formation with a density threshold of @xmath65 and a minimum star particle mass of 100  @xmath42 ( equivalent to the simulations of paper i , but also investigating the effect of the use of the zeus rather than the godunov solver ) . in all cases the evolution is characterized by an onset of star formation after @xmath66  myr , rising to a peak at @xmath67  myr , followed by a gradual decline .",
    "this evolution should be viewed as a response to the initial conditions of the simulation set - up , where dense , self - gravitating gas clouds are released synchronously at @xmath68 and allowed to collapse to high densities to form stars .",
    "after an initial burst of star formation , the rate is seen to decline by factors of about 5 after 10  myr .",
    "the choice of hydrodynamics solver is seen to make a @xmath69 difference to the sfr , with the additional heating introduced by the zeus solver reducing the sfr and delaying its onset and peak .",
    "the higher resolution of run sf , which involves a higher threshold density for star formation , leads to increased and more time variable sfrs compared to the lower resolution run that also uses the zeus solver .",
    "similar to the results of paper i , the overall sfrs per unit area are much higher , by factors of @xmath13 , than in observed galaxies ( e.g. , bigiel et al .",

    "the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of mass surface density ( or equivalently column density ) can provide useful insight into the processes governing a cloud s structure .",
    "kainulainen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed that clouds undergoing star formation have wider column density pdfs , including a power law tail of high column densities , while non - star - forming clouds have narrower distributions , better fit by a single log - normal function .",
    "the formation of pdf power law tails has been interpreted as being due to evolution of a separate self - gravitating component of the clouds that are undergoing free - fall collapse ( e.g. , kritsuk et al .",
    "2011 ; ballesteros - paredes et al . 2011 ) . in this case",
    "the development of such pdf tails would mark the onset of star formation .    for each of the four filament regions in the sf run ,",

    "a fair amount of structure can be present in the pdfs at all @xmath1 values , which we expect is partly a consequence of the global cloud structure that happens to be within the defined region . at the high @xmath1 end of the distributions ,",
    "power - law tails are often present , but can show variation in their properties depending on the viewing angle .",
    "we also zoom into a 25-pc cube , centered on the center of mass of the regions , and show the @xmath1 pdfs of these regions ( red lines in figure  [ fig : sigpdf ] ) .",

    "observationally , @xmath1 pdfs can be measured in a number of ways , including via sub - mm dust emission ( which requires also knowing the temperature structure of the clouds and dust emissivity properties per unit total mass ) and via nir or mir extinction ( which requires knowing dust opacities per unit total mass , but not cloud temperatures ) . in figure",

    "note that the mir extinction mapping technique has an upper limit of @xmath1 that it is able to probe , corresponding to @xmath84 .",
    "this region can be probed by sub - mm emission studies ( e.g. , battersby et al .",
    "2011 ; schneider et al .",
    "2014 ) , but these results are dependent on the accuracy of the derived dust temperature and assumed emissivity properties , and they also have lower spatial resolution compared to the mir extinction maps .    allowing for the inability of the mir extinction map to probe to very high @xmath1 values",
    ", the overall comparison is quite favorable .",
    "however , it should be noted that irdc c is one of the more extreme examples known , while the filament regions selected in the simulation are quite moderate examples of dense regions .",
    "more typical irdcs , selected from the bt12 sample , have been studied by kainulainen & tan ( 2013 ) , and these have relatively smaller amounts of gas at higher @xmath1 values .",
    "the gmcs and nearby star - forming regions studied by kainulainen et al .",
    "( 2009 ) show even smaller high @xmath1 mass fractions .",
    "the largest values of @xmath1 that are seen within the kpc - scale volume of the simulations are @xmath85 , much higher than have been seen via mm dust emission in irdcs or star - forming clouds .",
    "we evaluate the area and mass fractions of the pdfs that are @xmath86 and @xmath87 and list the results in table  [ tab : regions ] .",
    "there can be a large variation depending on orientation , i.e. , if the viewing direction is perpendicular or parallel to the main axis of the filament .",

    "however , with its mass per unit length of @xmath245 , one would expect a virialized velocity dispersion of only 5.2  @xmath246 .",
    "this difference is explained by the clump - boosting factor for velocity dispersion squared predicted by equation  [ eq : clumpboost ] of about 2.0 , i.e. , a factor of 1.4 for the velocity dispersion . since the clump itself is moderately super - virial , then",
    "this explains why the actual velocity dispersion increase is larger .",

    "for each of the clumps identified by the threshold density of @xmath249 , we measure the mass in the cells , the mass - weighted velocity dispersion about the center of mass velocity , and the mean half - mass radius , @xmath250 , in each of the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath81 directions , and the average value .",
    "we then evaluate the virial parameter , @xmath251 ( bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) ) at this half - mass scale .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : clumps ] .",
    "the clumps tend to have virial parameters @xmath252 , and almost always @xmath253 , indicating they are gravitationally bound and perhaps moderately supervirial ( although a contribution from surface pressure would also raise the virialized value of @xmath148 above unity ) .",
    "we tentatively conclude , with the caveat that increased numerical resolution is needed , that these clump structures are much closer to virial equilibrium than their parental filaments , which is to be expected given their much shorter dynamical times .",
    "we have continued the study begun in van loo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , following the evolution of a kiloparsec - scale patch of a galactic disk extracted from a global disk simulation down to @xmath254 resolution .",
    "we have followed collapse for 4  myr , which is ample time for the formation of dense filaments and clumps from the initial gmcs and , in the run allowing star formation , for significant star formation activity .",
    "the main goal has been to study the detailed structural , kinematic and dynamical properties of filamentary clouds that are in relatively early stages of collapse at @xmath255  4  myr . even in the run where star formation is allowed ( above the threshold density of @xmath256 )",
    ", almost no star formation has yet occurred in our sample of filaments .",
    "these properties have been compared to those of observed filamentary irdcs , which are also thought to be in a relatively early stage of collapse and star formation .",
    "note , irdcs are thus thought to be relatively unaffected by internal feedback from star formation , simplifying the comparison of simulation with observation by avoiding having to simulate star formation feedback , which requires much high resolution or more uncertain sub - grid models .",
    "our main conclusion is that the simulated filaments , which are forming from global collapse of gravitationally unstable gmcs mediated by galactic shear driven turbulence , show significant differences from observed irdcs .",
    "the filaments and their surrounding 50-pc scale regions often have dense gas mass fractions , e.g. , at @xmath257 that are larger than even the most extreme irdcs .",
    "the simulated filaments show large dispersions in their mass per unit lengths , caused by their fragmentation into dense clumps .",
    "the simulated filaments have more disordered kinematics , including velocity gradients as measured on 50 and 5 pc length scales .",
    "these more disordered kinematics equate to larger velocity dispersions than expected of virialized filaments .",
    "the implications of these results are that irdcs do not form by fast global collapse of gravitationally unstable gmcs .",
    "mediation , regulation and slowing of collapse by dynamically strong magnetic fields seems to be the most promising mechanism by which to reconcile simulations with observed irdcs .",
    "this scenario is given support by the recent observational results of pillai et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , who infer @xmath80  mg magnetic fields and sub - alfvnic turbulence in irdcs g11.11 - 0.12 and g0.253 + 0.016 from the ordered orientations of sub - mm dust emission polariazation vectors .",
    "lower ( 0.5  pc ) resolution simulations of the same initial conditions as our study , but including magnetic fields , have been recently presented by van loo et al .",
    "( 2015 , paper ii ) .",
    "a future goal is to extend these to 0.1  pc or higher resolution to be able to examine the effect of magnetic fields on filament structure , kinematics and dynamics .",
    "a more general output of this paper has been the presentation of a range of metrics of cloud , especially filamentary cloud , properties related to structure , kinematics and dynamics .",
    "these properties are presented for multi - phase ism , especially molecular , clouds evolving under pure self - gravitating hydrodynamics , i.e. , without inclusion of magnetic fields or star formation feedback ( although with the focus on nearly starless clouds , this feedback is expected to be limited ) .",
    "these cloud metrics include structural properties on 25 and 50  pc region scales , including pdfs of mass surface density and the fraction of gas above @xmath258 .",
    "structural properties of filaments include mass per unit length , dispersion in mass per unit length , filament and envelope densities and lateral widths .",
    "kinematic properties include filament and envelope velocity dispersions , comparison of mass per unit lengths with virial mass per unit lengths , external to internal pressures , and velocity gradients on various scales .",
    "standard kinematic and dynamical properties of clumps , forming in the filaments , have also been presented .",
    "these properties can all be compared to observed clouds , especially those of irdcs , as well as future simulations that include additional physics , especially magnetic fields and star formation feedback .",
