    ", one could rely on measurements of asymmetries of final state particles in bins of measured transverse momentum p@xmath19 .",
    "asymmetries are the ratio of the polarized to unpolarized cross - sections ( eq .  [ formula_all ] ) .",
    "these measurements offer an elegant way of accessing parton information by counting observed particle yields in different helicity states of the interacting beam(s ) and target ( @xmath20 versus @xmath21 . )",

    "the proton beam is extracted from the cern s sps at a cycle of approximately 17 seconds .",
    "the resulting muon beam from each cycle is then collided on a two cell @xmath38 target .",
