    "@xcite observed that galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift have a higher fraction of members with blue optical colors than clusters in the local universe , thus providing a key piece of evidence supporting galaxy evolution .",
    "this increase in blue members with redshift , named the butcher - oemler ( bo ) effect , was intensely debated for two decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , multiple optical studies based on spectroscopic observations have since confirmed the increase in blue , star - forming galaxies in higher redshift clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and found that bo galaxies reveal signs of recent and ongoing star formation .",
    "the paramount question now is have we seen only the tip of the iceberg ?",
    "most studies of star - forming galaxies in clusters rely on rest - frame ultraviolet or optical tracers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but uv / optical tracers can suffer severely from dust obscuration , especially when star formation is concentrated in the nuclear regions @xcite .",
    "for example , ultraluminous infrared galaxies have sf rates of @xmath10m@xmath1 , yet many ulirgs fail to even be detected at uv and optical wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . although corrections for dust attenuation are possible , reliable estimates of sf rates can not be achieved solely using rest - frame uv / optical observations @xcite",
    ".    a substantially more robust method of determining total sf rates is with mid - infrared ( mir ) imaging .",
    "the first mir imaging of galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts was taken with iso s isocam camera , and @xcite found that at least 90% of the star formation was hidden at optical wavelengths .",
    "the first handful of galaxy clusters observed with the mips camera on the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( sst ) have also revealed strong dust - obscured star formation @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear as to what causes the increase in star - forming galaxy cluster members .",
    "detailed morphological studies of blue galaxies [ defined as having @xmath8 is the color offset from the red sequence fit to the cluster ellipticals . ] with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) find that most are disk systems similar to those in local clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; past studies also find that many show signs of interactions or mergers @xcite .",
    "more recently , studies indicate that galaxy infall is a viable explanation for the significant numbers of blue galaxies and their disturbed morphologies in intermediate redshift clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a scenario supported by hierarchical clustering models @xcite . in this case ,",
    "galaxy clusters that are accreting a significant number of new members should have a higher fraction of star - forming galaxies , especially at higher redshifts when the amount of activity was enhanced also in the field .    here",
    "we present the first comprehensive study of sst / mips @xmath2 m imaging of galaxies that are spectroscopically confirmed members of eight massive ( @xmath0m@xmath1 ) x - ray luminous clusters spanning a wide redshift range ( @xmath11 ) . after presenting the data in  2",

    "individual frames were corrected with scan mirror position - dependent flats and then mosaiced with the mopex software @xcite to a pixel size of 1.2 .",
    "integration times ( @xmath28 ) and background levels ( @xmath29 ) in these mosaics are given in table [ clusters ] .",
    "photometry was performed with apex @xcite using a 3-diameter aperture , and an aperture correction of 9.49 as given in the mips data handbook .",
    "a small aperture is necessary to avoid contamination in the deep and crowded cluster fields .",
    "the fluxes are consistent with results from psf - fitting photometry with scatter from a 1:1 relation in the range of 15 - 25 @xmath30jy .",
    "to estimate the completeness of each mips catalog , we added to the mosaics artificial sources modeled on the psf . to avoid overcrowding , we simulated 30 signals at once , and repeated the process 30 times for each cluster ( the @xmath31 completeness limits , @xmath32 , are presented in table [ clusters ] ) .",
    "finally , the mips sources were matched with the optical catalogs using a 2  search radius @xcite .",
    "from randomization of the mips coordinates , we estimate the rate of false identification to be @xmath33 , and little dependency of this error rate on redshift or color is observed .",
    "star formation rates are based on the @xmath2 m fluxes .",
    "first , the total infrared luminosity ( @xmath34 ) of each galaxy was determined using a family of infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from @xcite .",
    "we choose the range of seds that are representative of the galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey @xcite , and at each redshift adopt the median conversion factor from @xmath35 to @xmath36 given by these models . at @xmath37 ,",
    "the error due to the adopted conversion factor is @xmath38% , but the error increases to a factor of 1.5 - 2.0 at lower and higher redshifts . for the parts of our analysis that are sensitive to the sf rates , we take these errors into account . as a check , we note that our total infrared luminosities in ms1054 agree well with the values in @xcite .",
    "the conversion from total infrared luminosities to star formation rates is done following @xcite .",
    "we assume that the emission at @xmath39 is due to star formation but it could also be due to dust - enshrouded active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "however , in comparing the x - ray and @xmath39 detections , only one cluster galaxy ( in rxj0152 ) is detected in both and rejected . while the agn fraction in clusters seems to increase with redshift @xcite ,",
    "the estimated agn fraction is only 2% at @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite also find evidence that at @xmath41 , any excess x - ray agn are located at @xmath42  mpc whereas we focus on the central mpc of each cluster .",
    "although we can not completely rule out possible contamination by weak obscured agn , we have excluded x - ray agn and thus assume that the galaxies detected by mips are powered by dusty star formation ; see @xcite for a more detailed argument on why this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the color - magnitude diagrams of the five main clusters with photometry from h07 . because the mips sensitivity varies from cluster to cluster",
    ", we apply a sf rate limit of 5 m@xmath1  yr@xmath3 .",
    "the first immediate observation is that the number of strongly star - forming galaxies increases significantly with redshift . using a field galaxy sample drawn from the same photometric and spectroscopic catalogs",
    ", we estimate a possible field contamination at @xmath5 to be @xmath43% ( i.e. no more than one galaxy per cluster ) . in figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "the dotted lines represent the original color criterion for bo galaxies . the ratio of the number of cluster galaxies with mir sf rate @xmath44m@xmath1  yr@xmath3   above this color cut to the number of blue galaxies ( @xmath45 ) increases with redshift",
    ".      for each cluster , we compute and plot in figure [ fig2 ] the fraction of confirmed star - forming cluster members after selecting by rest - frame b - band magnitude ( @xmath46 ) , cluster - centric distance mpc , the mips imaging for ms1358 only extends to @xmath47 mpc ( @xmath48% of @xmath49 for these clusters ) . ] , and mir star formation rate ( @xmath44m@xmath1  yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "the errors on @xmath50 represent the range that can be produced by taking the minimum and maximum conversion factors from @xmath35 to @xmath51 instead of a single average value for each cluster , and by varying the different selection thresholds by amounts comparable to the errors on each of these parameters .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that the fraction of galaxies in clusters with mir sf rates @xmath44m@xmath1  yr@xmath3   steadily climbs from @xmath52% locally to @xmath53% at @xmath5 .",
    "because h07 showed that a cluster s morphological composition can vary depending on whether members are selected by mass or by luminosity , we apply an additional stellar mass cut of @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the mass cut is only applied to the five main clusters for which uniform photometry and thus stellar masses are available ; the remaining three clusters are shown only as upper limits . while the mass cut attenuates the increase in fraction of star - forming members , it does not completely suppress the trend .",
    "thus the mir bo effect is not due to an increase in the fraction of faint , low - mass members temporarily brightened by strong star formation .",
    "having established an increase in the fraction of mir - detected galaxies from @xmath55 to @xmath41 , we stress that optical studies are likely underestimating the increase in star - forming cluster galaxies with redshift .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , an increasing number of strong dust - obscured star - forming members appear on or near the red sequence at higher redshifts ; these are not included in traditional color - selected bo studies .",
    "the late - type morphologies of these members supports our intepretation of dusty star formation and red colors due to extinction ( see also a901/902 ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the standard bo definition of @xmath45 , the fraction of blue galaxies with @xmath46 and @xmath56  mpc at @xmath41 is @xmath57% ; however , including the red , massive , star - forming members raises the total fraction of blue / star - forming members to @xmath9% .",
    "we note that for the five main clusters , the increase in the blue / star - forming fraction due to these red , star - forming members is \\{1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.7 } at @xmath58\\{0.02 , 0.33 , 0.59 , 0.83 } , @xmath59 the relative importance of including red , dusty star - forming members increases with redshift .",
    "is this increase linked to galaxy infall ? in figure  [ fig2 ] , both cl0024 ( @xmath60 ) and ms2053 ( @xmath40 ) are above the general trend established by the other six clusters . both cl0024 and ms2053 have enhanced star formation compared to other clusters at similar redshift , and both have bimodal redshift distributions .",
    "cl0024 is made of two colliding subclusters @xcite , and has an unusually large number of luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite conclude from that ms2053 has a significant number ( @xmath61% ) of infalling galaxies ; these members tend to be blue and star - forming .",
    "both cl0024 and ms2053 are accreting a large number of new members and have high fractions of dusty star - forming galaxies .",
    "we speculate that the increase in star - forming members reflects the recent accretion of new members , @xmath59 galaxy infall , and that such events are more frequent at higher redshift due to the process of cluster assembly @xcite . as further evidence of this ,",
    "80% of the mips - detected galaxies in the @xmath41 clusters are more than 700 kpc from the cluster cores in projected distance and thus the mir butcher - oemler effect is significantly altered by only considering the inner 500 kpc of the clusters ( open symbols in fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "we present the first comprehensive study of sst / mips 24@xmath30 m observations for seven massive , x - ray luminous galaxy clusters spanning a wide redshift range ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "uniform photometry , high resolution hst imaging , and extensive redshift catalogs enable us to measure the fraction of members with strong , dust - obscured star formation .",
    "the fraction of cluster galaxies with mir star formation rates @xmath44m@xmath1  yr@xmath3   increases from 3% in coma to @xmath53% in clusters at @xmath5 , and this trend is evident in both luminosity ( @xmath46 ) and mass - selected samples ( @xmath7m@xmath1 ) .",
    "optically - based studies increasingly underestimate the total amount of star formation in cluster galaxies with redshift because many of these dusty red star - forming members are missed in color - selected samples .",
    "these tend to be late - type galaxies that are red because of dust extinction which disguises their high levels of obscured star formation ( @xmath62m@xmath1  yr@xmath3 ) . defining the sf fraction to include both optically blue and red , but mips - detected members doubles the fraction at @xmath5 from @xmath57% to @xmath9% ( @xmath56mpc ) .",
    "lastly , our study indicates that the bo effect and the increase in obscured star - forming members are linked to galaxy infall : 80% of the mir - detected members at @xmath41 are outside the cluster cores ( @xmath63mpc ) , and the two clusters at @xmath64 that are accreting a substantial number of new members also have an enhanced fraction of galaxies with mir sf rates @xmath44m@xmath1  yr@xmath3 .",
