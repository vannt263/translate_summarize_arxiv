    "the antiferromagnetic formulations of field theories in four dimensions have been recently paid considerable attention  @xcite .",
    "the hope is to give some insight into the well known triviality problem in field theory  @xcite .",
    "also there are other interesting phenomena as the apparition of new particles  @xcite .",
    "a spin model , in a simple cubic lattice with first neighbor interactions , becomes antiferromagnetic if the coupling is negative .",
    "however , with some exceptions @xcite , a simple _ staggered _ transformation maps the antiferromagnetic phase into the usual ferromagnetic one .    to obtain a non - equivalent antiferromagnetic phase one has to include further couplings or modify the lattice geometry ( see for instance ref @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the simplest method to obtain non - trivial antiferromagnetism in four dimensions is to work in an f@xmath1 lattice .",
    "it is defined by taking out the odd sites ( the sum of the coordinates is odd ) of a simple hypercubic lattice .",
    "four dimensional antiferromagnetic o(@xmath0 ) models have been already studied by monte carlo(mc ) means in this lattice .",
    "the o(1 ) model ( ising model ) was considered in reference @xcite : a weak first order transition was found .",
    "a study of the o(4 ) model appears in reference @xcite : in the range of the lattice sizes simulated , the behavior pointed to a second order transition .    in this letter",
    "we consider the intermediate cases : o(2 ) and o(3 ) , to know if the order of the transition changes with @xmath0 . we will give evidence that the transitions are in both cases first order , but the numerical difficulties grow with @xmath0 .",
    "we also present an analytical study in the @xmath3 limit .",
    "we label the coordinates of an f@xmath1 lattice as a set of integers @xmath4 such that @xmath5 is even .",
    "we consider the action    @xmath6    where the sum runs over 24 pairs of nearest neighbors and the field , @xmath7 , is a normalized @xmath0 component real vector .",
    "we work in a hypercubic lattice of size @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions .    in the ferromagnetic region ( @xmath9 )",
    "this model is expected to belong to the same universality class of the simple cubic model : it presents a second order transition with mean field critical exponents .    in the antiferromagnetic sector ( @xmath10 )",
    "the system also presents an ordering phase transition , but the structure of the ordered phase is much more complex .",
    "in fact , it can be easily checked that the ground state presents frustration . moreover , the ordered vacuum is not isotropic .",
    "the independent order parameters we can construct with periodicity 2 are    @xmath11    where the sums are extended to all the f@xmath1 sites . the dots stand for the other 3 combinations of hyperplanes and 2 of planes .",
    "we label the site @xmath12 inside the @xmath13 elementary cell with its cartesian coordinates @xmath14 . in practice",
    "we measure the 8 different magnetizations associated to a given position in the elementary cells , @xmath15 , defined as the normalized sum of the magnetization for all @xmath13 cells for each of the 8 sites .",
    "@xmath16    the quantities ( [ parord ] ) can be expressed as linear combinations of these magnetizations .",
    "the mean magnetization and the susceptibility are defined respectively as : @xmath17    the binder cumulants are defined in a such way that @xmath18 and @xmath19 :    @xmath20    for the connected susceptibility we use the definition @xmath21",
    "for an operator @xmath22 that diverges as @xmath23 , its mean value at a coupling @xmath24 in a size @xmath25 lattice can be written , in the critical region , assuming the finite - size scaling ansatz as  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a smooth scaling function and @xmath28 is the universal leading corrections - to - scaling exponent . in order to eliminate the unknown @xmath27 function we can measure at the coupling where @xmath27 presents a maximum as for @xmath29 or for the specific heat @xmath30 .",
    "another method  @xcite is to study the behavior of the quantities    @xmath31    we use @xmath32 as scaling variable  @xcite .",
    "it is direct to obtain @xmath33 we use that @xmath34 and @xmath35 to obtain the critical exponents .",
    "the expected fss behavior of a first - order transition  @xcite corresponds to apparent exponents : @xmath36 .",
    "we will consider in this letter the cases @xmath2 . we have used a metropolis algorithm followed by @xmath37 overrelaxation steps as update method , @xmath37 depending on the model and lattice size .",
    "we have worked in lattice sizes up to 48 .",
    "we used for the computation the dedicated machine rtnn , consisting in 16 dual pentium pro units .",
    "for the largest lattices we parallelized , using shared memory , in each dual motherboard .",
    "every @xmath38 sweeps we measured the energy , the specific heat and the 8 period - two magnetizations @xmath39 . in table  [ simulations ] we report the parameters of the simulation at the critical region .    in order to extrapolate to the neighborhood of the critical point",
    ", we used the usual reweighting method  @xcite .",
    "we also simulated at the maxima of the specific heat because the region where the extrapolation was reliable was not large enough .",
    "these simulations were about one fourth of the total cpu time .",
    "the errors were computed with a jack - knife method , performing 50 blocks in order to achieve statistical error bars within 10% of precision .",
    ".description of the simulation in the critical region for o(2 ) ( upper part ) and o(3 ) ( lower part ) .",
    "we report the lattice size , the frequency of measures , number of over - relaxation steps for each metropolis one , autocorrelation time ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath41 , iterations in @xmath40 units , and the coupling .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^ , > , < \" , ]     in table  [ betacr ] we compare ( [ betacn ] ) with mc results for @xmath42 .",
    "the good agreement between the simulations for these values of @xmath0 and the analytical limit when @xmath3 points to the absence of an abrupt change of the critical properties as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "exactly at @xmath43 the order of the transition is not clear , because the divergence in the correlation length can simply be caused by the goldstone bosons of the symmetry breaking .",
    "in this letter we present a mc study of the four dimensional antiferromagnetic o(2 ) and o(3 ) models in the f@xmath1 lattice .",
    "we study the critical behavior of these models with fss techniques .",
    "there is an apparent asymptotic behavior which gives false critical exponents for not large enough lattice sizes .",
    "this transitory effect can be understood as caused by a large correlation length whose presence can be demonstrated for some observables ( as the eigenvalues of the sum tensor of the period - two magnetizations ) .",
    "this must be very carefully controlled , because as we see in our case , the behavior changes drastically when larger lattice sizes are considered , revealing the true first order nature of the o(@xmath44 ) , o(@xmath45 ) transitions .",
    "we also see that this effect is bigger as @xmath0 grows , so that for larger values of @xmath0 , it is very difficult to study numerically the critical properties of the system . however , the great accuracy in the determination of the critical point obtained by the analytical calculation at @xmath43 points to a similar qualitative behavior for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "we thank to the cicyt ( contracts aen94 - 0218 , aen96 - 1634 ) for partial financial support .",
    "we have employed for the simulations dedicated pentium pro machines ( rtnn project ) .",
