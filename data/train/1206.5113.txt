    "@xcite examined the distribution of field strength in the ap star population and concluded that a direct link between ap stars and high field magnetic white dwarfs ( @xmath16 g ) may exist assuming magnetic flux conservation , but that low - field white dwarfs are without known progenitors .",
    "however , @xcite found a progenitor deficit for high - field white dwarfs and postulated that a large fraction of massive main - sequence stars ( @xmath17 ) may harbour weak fields ( 10 - 100  g ) .",
    "we present a survey of 58 high proper - motion white dwarfs conducted with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph ( fors ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "the observations , presented in section 2 , provided us with intensity and circular polarization spectra enabling high - sensitivity measurements of the surface - averaged ( @xmath18 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath19 ) magnetic fields ( section 3 ) . in particular , we examine the sample properties ( section 3.1 ) , our new low - field detections ( section 3.2 ) and instances of variable high - fields ( section 3.3 ) , and the sample kinematical properties ( section 3.4 ) as well as other interesting aspects of this survey ( section 3.5 ) .",
    "we summarize and discuss some implications of our results in section 4 .",
    "we obtained two sets of observations using the fors spectrograph attached to the 8 m telescopes at paranal observatory .",
    "the first data set was obtained with the fors1 attached to ut2 .",
    "we used the 600 lines per mm grism centred at 4650   ( grism 600b ) .",
    "the slit width was set to 1.0 arcsec to obtain a spectral dispersion of 1.51  per pixel and a resolution of @xmath20 .",
    "the second set of observations was obtained with the fors2 attached to ut1 . for these observations we used the 1200 lines per mm",
    "grism centred at 6500 (grism 1200r+93 ) providing a spectral dispersion of 0.73   per pixel .",
    "the slit width was set to 1.0 arcsec to obtain a spectral resolution of 3.0  .",
    "both sets of spectra were obtained in the spectropolarimetric mode where the observing sequence consisted of an exposure with the wollaston prism rotated to @xmath21 immediately followed by an exposure with the wollaston prism rotated to @xmath22 .",
    "additional spectra of the programme stars were obtained at eso using the new technology telescope ( ntt ) and at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) and kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "we also collected spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 8 , and recycled our published spectra @xcite .",
    "the complete data set will be described in a forthcoming publication and , here , we employ key results of the spectroscopic analysis of these complementary spectra .",
    "in summary , the spectra obtained with the ntt have a resolution of @xmath23   and a spectral range of 3700 - 7400  , the spectra obtained with the ctio 4 m telescope have a resolution of @xmath24   with a spectral range of 3700 - 7480  , and the spectra obtained with the kpno 4 m telescope have a resolution of @xmath25   and a spectral range of 3660 - 6790  .",
    "the sdss spectra cover a range from 3800 to 9200   and have a resolution of @xmath26  .",
    "table  [ tbl_obs ] lists the selected targets .",
    "figure  [ fig_da ] shows the intensity spectra obtained during the two fors programmes .",
    "some of the blue spectra showed heavy element lines ( ca  h&k ) characteristic of polluted da white dwarfs ( daz ) , while the red spectra only showed h@xmath1 with the exception of the spectrum of nltt  11748 : the strong , saturated na  d doublet ( @xmath27m , @xmath28m ) at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath29revealed a high neutral gas ( nai ) column density in the interstellar medium ( ism ) toward the star .",
    "the na  d doublet was not detected toward any other objects from our sample .",
    "the star nltt  11748 is located toward a known high - density line - of - sight @xcite and the scaled ism hi column density ( @xmath30 @xmath31 ) correlates well with the relatively large extinction coefficient @xmath32 measured by @xcite .",
    "observations of the dc white dwarfs nltt  8525 , nltt  8904 , nltt  11051 , nltt  20389 , and pm  j04356@xmath146105 , of the dz white dwarfs nltt  57760 and pm  j08186@xmath143110 , and of the dq white dwarfs nltt  8733 and nltt  14553 will be presented in a forthcoming publication .",
    "two targets that were subsequently reclassified are not listed : nltt  18393 ( m3.5 ) and nltt  40020 ( g5v ) .",
    "finally , we also excluded one observation of nltt  17486 obtained on ut 2007 october 31 and all observations of nltt  40636 because of pointing errors .",
    "the coordinates and proper - motion measurements are from @xcite .",
    "the circular polarization spectra were obtained using two successive exposures obtained with the wollaston prism rotated to the angle @xmath33 and @xmath22 and were calculated following : @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the fluxes from the ordinary and extra - ordinary beams , respectively .",
    "the direction of polarization of these beams are perpendicular to each other .",
    "this method is used to eliminate possible biases to first order @xcite .",
    "we calibrated the acquisition images and converted the count rates into broad - band magnitudes .",
    "the procedure is described in appendix a and the magnitudes are listed in table  [ tbl_mag ] along with published @xmath37 magnitudes and two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xmath38 magnitudes .",
    "a close examination of the acquisition images of nltt  17662 revealed the the presence of a close ( sep.@xmath39 arcsecond , @xmath40 ) companion to the white dwarf approximately 1 mag fainter .",
    "a comparison with the first - epoch digitized sky survey ( dss ) image proves that the faint companion is in common proper - motion with the bright star .",
    "fortunately , both stars were acquired during the spectroscopic observations and we were able to analyse both fors spectra .",
    "similarly , our acquisition image of nltt  56045 also reveal the presence of a close common proper - motion companion 1.1 mag fainter in white light ( sep.@xmath41 arcsecond , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the faint component was also acquired during spectroscopic observations but no spectra were extracted .    finally , we cross - correlated our sample of stars with the sdss data release 8 and obtained @xmath43 photometry for 18 objects .",
    "only one of these had a sdss spectrum .",
    "table  [ tbl_sdss ] lists the available @xmath43 photometry .",
    "a correction of @xmath44 mag was applied to the tabulated @xmath45 magnitude prior to our analysis ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?"
