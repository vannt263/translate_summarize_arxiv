    "pressure effect is one of the most interesting and direct probes and ways to control of the relation between electronic structure and superconductivity .",
    "one starting point can be an observation that , in the high - tc cuprates at ambient pressure , there exists significant material dependence of @xmath2 , which remained an important puzzle even within the single - layer family .",
    "a recent work by the present author and coworkers@xcite has demonstrated , with a two - orbital model , that , while the usual wisdom is to consider the cuprate as a one - band ( @xmath0 ) system , a hybridization with the second ( @xmath1 ) band around the fermi energy significantly affects @xmath2 in the spin - fluctuation mediated pairing .",
    "there , the larger the energy offset ( @xmath4 ) between the two orbitals ( i.e. , smaller the band mixing ) , the higher the @xmath2 .",
    "we can then follow this line of approach to show that applying pressures can significantly affect tc , through the pressure dependence of the @xmath1 hybridization .",
    "if we turn to the multi - layer cuprates , inter - layer pair hopping is suggested to be important@xcite , which may have an interesting effect on pressure dependence .",
    "pressure effect is also interesting for carbon - based superconductors , typically fullerene systems , where both of the electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions are strong .",
    "we can then discuss the tc dome against the interactions.@xcite in a recently discovered aromatic family of superconductors ( picene , etc)@xcite , we have again multi - band systems@xcite , which in these class of materials derive from multiple molecular orbitals . as a result",
    "the fermi surface is an intriguing composite of different pockets / sheets having different dimensionalities arising from anisotropic transfers between the molecular orbitals , and pressure effects should be an important probe of these .",
    "in the physics of high-@xmath2 cuprates , optimizing their @xmath2 remains a fundamental yet still open problem .",
    "empirically , important parameters that control @xmath2 have been identified to be chemical composition , structural parameters , the number of layers , etc , besides the doping concentration . specifically , several key structural parameters have been suggested : the bond length between copper and in - plane oxygen@xcite , and the cu - apical oxygen distance ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , refs.@xcite conclude that larger the level offset @xmath4 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 wannier orbitals , higher the @xmath2 , where @xmath4 is governed by the apical - oxygen height and the inter - layer distance .",
    "the key material parameters in the cuprates are : the apical oxygen height ( @xmath6 ) above the cuo@xmath7 plane and the separation ( @xmath8 ) between the cuo@xmath7 planes determine the level offset @xmath4 between the cu(@xmath0 ) and cu(@xmath1 ) _ wannier _ orbitals through @xmath9 ( offset between o(@xmath10 ) and o(@xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( offset between atomic cu(@xmath0 ) and cu(@xmath1 ) ) .",
    "this captures the material dependence of @xmath2 , covering a broad range of single - layer cuprates ( la , hg , bi , and tl ) .",
    "these are depicted in fig .  [ levels ] .",
    "pressure effect then is an ideal _ in situ _ way to probe the structure - dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "so far we know for the cuprates that : ( i ) @xmath2 tends to be enhanced under hydrostatic pressure for pressure @xmath13 gpa @xcite , while ( ii ) uniaxial pressures produce anisotropic responses of @xmath2 , namely , an @xmath14-axis compression generally raises @xmath2 while @xmath15-axis compression has an opposite effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the pressure coefficient tends to be smaller for materials having higher @xmath2s@xcite .    basically , the effects of uniaxial pressures come from the pressure - dependence of @xmath4 affected by the crystal field , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ pressure_fig2](a ) , where a - axis compression , which enhances the apex o height , raises tc .",
    "more precisely , however , while the variation of @xmath2 under pressure is indeed affected by @xmath4 , especially in the relatively low-@xmath2 cuprates , the higher-@xmath2 cuprates such as hgba@xmath7cuo@xmath16 ( hg1201 ) with large @xmath4 has a smaller @xmath2 variation against pressure .",
    "we can also show that one factor contributing the pressure effect is , on top of @xmath0 and @xmath1 orbitals , cu(@xmath3 ) orbital can be relevant , whose level is raised with pressure , resulting in a better nested fermi surface .",
    "this is shown in a model comprising all of the @xmath17 and @xmath3 orbitals explicitly .",
    "this , along with the increase in the band width , is shown to cause a higher @xmath2 under pressure .",
    "so we display the theoretical result , for la and hg cuprates , for the dependence of the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation ( a measure of tc ) on uniaxial pressures in fig .",
    "[ pressure_fig2](b ) or on the hydrostatic pressure in fig .",
    "[ pressure_fig2](c ) .",
    "there we have decomposed the pressure effects into three contributions from the change of @xmath4 due to pressure , change of @xmath18 , and change of the ratio , @xmath19 , of the further neighbour hoppings to the nearest neighbour one that determines the warping of the fermi surface .",
    "for details see ref.@xcite .     of the eliashberg equation",

    "triangles ( circles ) indicate the result for the la ( hg ) cuprates .",
    "arrows depict the contributions to the pressure effect from @xmath4 , @xmath18 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",

    "however , in fig .",
    "[ pressure_fig2](c ) we can notice that the increase in @xmath18 results in an enhancement of @xmath23 in hg , while the opposite occurs for la .",
    "if we vary @xmath30 with a fixed band width @xmath18 , the absolute value of the renormalized green s function squared @xmath25 at @xmath26 monotonically decreases with @xmath30 as in fig .",
    "[ vgg ] ( for the hg compound in this figure ) due to an increased self - energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the pairing interaction @xmath27 increases with @xmath30 because the spin fluctuations develop monotonically .",
    "consequently , @xmath29 , a rough measure of the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation for @xmath31wave superconductivity , exhibits a peak .",
    "if we repeat the calculation for the la cuprate , we can show that the hg cuprate is located on the right of the peak , while the la cuprate on the left .",
    "this explains the opposite contributions for the @xmath18 effect .",
    "since the important units in the cuprates come in two flavours , cuo octahedron and cuo pyramid , the difference in the effect of the apex oxygen height between them is intriguing .",
    "figure  [ ho - ed ] shows the relationship between the apical oxygen height @xmath5 and @xmath12 ( the energy difference between the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 atomic orbitals ) .",
    "we can see that , while @xmath12 is positively correlated with the apical oxygen height in both octahedral and pyramidal systems .",
    "more precisely , while the value of @xmath12 is significantly greater for pyramids , dependence on @xmath5 is smaller for pyramids with only one apical o per unit .",
    "this may be one reason why @xmath2 increases in spite of somewhat larger reduction in @xmath5 in bi - layer system than in single - layer system under hydrostatic pressure@xcite .",

    "this may also possibly help materials - design for higher tc .     and",
    "@xmath32 ( carrier concentration ) for the double - layer system with ( red lines ) and without ( black ) interlayer pair hopping processes .",
    "@xmath33 is sc transition temperature while @xmath34 af transition ( nel ) temperature .",

    "the superconductivity in a double - layer hubbard model with and without the interlayer pair hopping , as studied by solving the eliashberg equation with the fluctuation exchange approximation , reveals that the interlayer pair hopping ( fig .",
    "[ pairhop ] , inset ) acts to increase the pairing interaction and the self - energy simultaneously , but that the former effect supersedes the latter and enhances the superconductivity ( fig .",
    "[ pairhop ] ) .",
    "study of the triple - layer case with the interlayer pair hopping reveals that the superconductivity is further enhanced but tends to be saturated toward the triple - layer case .",
    "there is a class of superconductors in which the electron - electron coulomb repulsion and the electron - phonon coupling are strong at the same time .",
    "this most typically applies to alkali - doped fullerides .",
    "although the pairing is an @xmath42-wave , tc has recently been found to be dome - shaped and sits next to an antiferromagnetic phase in the temperature - pressure phase diagram@xcite .",
    "thus an interplay of the electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions becomes an interesting problem .",
    "this may also apply to the aromatic superconductors in the next section .",
    "we can tackle this problem with the holstein - hubbard model , which is a simple model that incorporates both electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the model is characterized by the energy @xmath43 of dispersionless ( einstein ) phonons , the on - site hubbard interaction @xmath30 and the electron - phonon coupling @xmath44 .",
    "there is a body of works which investigates the competition between the two interactions in this model .",
    "the study of the one - dimensional case based on the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique or quantum monte carlo analysis has revealed some general features.@xcite in the opposite limit of infinite spatial dimensions , @xmath45 , where the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) becomes exact , the effect of the competition between the two kinds of interactions have been studied  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional system is also studied.@xcite    however , an important question remains as follows : a usual wisdom in capturing the system is to regard it as having an effective interaction @xmath46 , where @xmath23 is the static effective electron - electron interaction mediated by phonons .",
    "however , this is only valid in the antiadiabatic limit for @xmath47 where the phonon - mediated interaction becomes non - retarded , so that the real question is to what extent this approximation remains valid when we vary @xmath30 and/or @xmath43 .",
    "in other words how can we go beyond migdal theorem@xcite or the macmillan equation.@xcite in the fullerene superconductor , @xmath30 , @xmath23 , and @xmath43 are all comparable to the electronic bandwidth @xmath18 , so the question becomes real .",
    "we have studied the holstein - hubbard model , at half - filling , with the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , with a continuous - time quantum monte carlo impurity solver , which enables us to work in the regime where @xmath30 , @xmath23 , and @xmath43 are comparable to the bandwidth.@xcite we show in fig .  [ hh ] that the phonon - induced retardation or the coulomb repulsion have the effect of significantly decreasing and shifting the @xmath2 dome against @xmath48 . in order to understand and interpret the observed behavior we can introduce an effective static model derived from a lang - firsov transformation . as for the pressure effects",
    ", the quantities @xmath43 , @xmath30 and @xmath23 should be affected by pressure , which is an interesting future problem to elaborate . in real fullerides",
    "there is also a complication coming from the jahn - teller degree of freedom.@xcite     against @xmath49 for various values of the phonon energy @xmath43 with the hubbard @xmath50 ( top panel ) , and for various values of @xmath30 with @xmath51 ( bottom ) , with the hopping integral @xmath52 as the unit of energy .",
    "the lines connecting symbols are guides for the eye , while the black curve in each panel indicates @xmath2 in the attractive hubbard model .",
    "after @xcite .",
    ", width=302 ]",
    "let us move on to the pressure effects on the aromatic hydrocarbon superconductors , especially picene superconductors@xcite .",
    "potassium ( k ) doped picene has been attracting much attention after the experimental report of superconductivity with transition temperature tc=18 k , which is very high as an organic material .",
    "furthermore , there is a very recent report for a striking pressure effect , where tc is raised to about 30 k by applying pressure @xmath53 gpa@xcite . at present , neither the pressure effect nor is even the superconducting mechanism itself well understood theoretically . if the picene superconductor obeys conventional bcs theory , the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy will be an important factor determining tc .",
    "the positive pressure dependence of tc seems to contradict with a conventional mechanism , since applying a pressure is likely to decrease dos .",
    "specifically , we have to carefully examine how the pressure affects the electronic structure , since the theoretical band structure of picene superconductors , being multi - orbital systems , is rather complex@xcite .",
    "this is important , since , if an unconventional mechanism , such as the electron - electron correlation , is at work , tc will be sensitive to the fermi surface structure .",
    "thus , in the following , we show some results on the electronic structure under pressure .    here",
    "electronic and crystalline structures of k - doped picene crystals are investigated based on the density functional theory ( dft ) with local density approximation ( lda ) adopted for exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "the actual calculations are performed using quantum espresso package@xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the case in which three k atoms are doped per a picene molecule , for which the superconductivity is reported . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the lattice constants are fixed to the most updated experimental values@xcite in the present study , and the internal coordinates are relaxed by minimizing calculated forces on each atom . for the pressure effect , the calculation is done for an `` artificial '' pressure introduced as decreased lattice parameters , as a first step towards understanding of pressure effects in picene superconductors .",
    "thus the pressure effect is simulated by repeating the calculation with reduced lattice parameters . for simplicity ,",
    "lattice constants in three directions are scaled by a common scaling factor , which means that the anisotropy in the bulk modulus is neglected .",
    "we carried out calculations with scaling factors 100% ( experimental lattice constants at ambient pressure ) , down to 95% .",
    "ideally , a fully theoretical method is desirable , where the lattice constants are relaxed within a theoretical structural optimization under pressure .",
    "however , precise prediction of the lattice constants within dft is difficult for the present target material .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "a theoretical factor is that we should have , especially for the undoped molecular crystal , a calculation with the van der waals interaction taken into account , but the method is still under improvements . once the lattice constants are given , the difference between lda and generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) is less significant for internal coordinates .",
    "a second , experimental factor here is that there is no definite experimental lattice constants , which is mainly because the superconducting fraction is very tiny ( @xmath53 per cent ) , even at ambient pressure .",
    "these are why we have opted for the artificial treatment of pressure effects , and leave more sophisticated works as future problems .    even when the lattice constants are fixed and only internal coordinates are relaxed , calculation is still hard , since the organic system has many metastable structures .",
    "for example , there are several possible ways for putting the doped k atoms ( three per molecule ) into the molecular crystal . here",
    "we focus on , following the previous theoretical work by kosugi et al@xcite , two kinds of k atom arrangements , which we call k@xmath54picene and k@xmath7k@xmath55picene structures , as most probable candidates . in k@xmath56picene",
    ", all the k atoms are doped within the layer of picene molecules arranged in a herringbone pattern . on the other hand",
    ", k@xmath7k@xmath55picene has one k atom resides in the interlayer region while the other two in the intralayer region . in practice , we start internal coordinate relaxation from the k@xmath56- or k@xmath7k@xmath55-structure for each set of lattice constants .",
    "picene and k@xmath7k@xmath55picene at ambient pressure .",
    "( b ) theoretically optimized crystal structures at ambient pressure ( 100% ) and for the 95% reduced lattice constants .",
    "each panel displaying a unit cell is a side view of the molecular layer.,width=302 ]    fig .",
    "[ picene_fig1](a ) shows the calculated crystal structures along with the two wannier functions ( basically the lumo and lumo+1 of the picene molecule ) for the conduction band ( which comprises four bands ) at ambient pressure .",
    "the ambient pressure result , with the experimentally updated lattice constants , shows that k@xmath56- and k@xmath7k@xmath55 continue to be the ( meta)stable structures .",
    "if we turn to fig .",
    "[ picene_fig1](b ) , which displays the change of the structure when the lattice constants are reduced to 95% , we can see that the main features of k@xmath56- and k@xmath7k@xmath55-structures are respectively retained even with the shrunk lattice .",
    "however , a closer examination reveals that there are significant differences in the dopant positions and the relative angle between two picene molecules .",
    "the calculated band structures are plotted in fig .",
    "[ picene_fig2 ] .",
    "we first note that the obtained band structures are different from the previous theoretical work@xcite even at ambient pressure .",
    "this naturally comes from the adaptation in the present calculation of the updated experimental lattice constants@xcite .",
    "basically the c - axis is elongated in the update , so that the band structure becomes more two - dimensional and simpler compared with the previous calculation .",
    "if we turn to the pressure effect , a notable feature in fig .",
    "[ picene_fig2 ] is that the band structure changes in a nonmonotonic manner against pressure , especially for k@xmath56-structure .",
    "this comes from the dopant positions and relative angle between molecules that change nonmonotonically against pressure , where the band structure is sensitive to the change .",
    "although a discussion of tc would require a more sophisticated treatment of the pressure , a message here is that a decrease in the lattice constants can exert an effect beyond a simple expansion of band width .",
    "this fact is highlighted in the fermi surfaces in fig .",
    "[ picene_fig3 ] , which plots the change in the fermi surface as the lattice constants are reduced down to 96% . with the updated experimental lattice constants",
    "the fermi surface at ambient pressure is remarkably simpler .",
    "we have however the sensitivity to the dopant positions : namely , k@xmath54picene has a composite of a two - dimensional cylinder and a pair of one - dimensional sheets , while k@xmath7k@xmath55picene has two pairs of more or less one - dimensional sheets . for both k3- and k2k1-structures",
    ", the pressure induces some complexity in the fermi surface structures .",
    "remarkably , we can see that the topology of the fermi surface changes , i.e. , a lifshitz transition occurs as the lattice is shrunk , for both of k3- and k2k1-structures .",
    "it is an interesting future issue to investigate the relation between tc and the dopant arrangement , especially the lifshitz transition .    for the cuprates",
