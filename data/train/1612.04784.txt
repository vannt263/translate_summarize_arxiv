    "the widespread explanation of the fuor phenomenon is a sizable increase in accretion rate from the circumstellar disc onto the stellar surface .",
    "the cause of increased accretion is still being discussed .",
    "but the possible triggering mechanisms of fuor outburst could be : thermal or gravitational instability in the circumstellar disk ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "another important option is to study the pre - outburst variability of the fuor objects .",
    "our ccd photometric observations of fuor objects were performed with the 2 m rcc , the 50/70 cm schmidt , and the 60 cm cassegrain telescopes of the national astronomical observatory rozhen ( bulgaria ) and with the 1.3 m rc telescope of the skinakas observatory of the institute of astronomy , university of crete ( greece ) .",

    "the photometric observation obtained before the outburst displayed only small amplitude variations in all pass - bands typical of t tauri stars .",
    "acoording to our data the outburst started sometime before may 2010 , and reached the first maximum value at the period september - october 2010 . since october 2010 ,",
