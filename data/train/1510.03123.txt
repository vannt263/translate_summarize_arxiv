    "* ) .    for those agn with noticeable fe k@xmath1 lines , the fluorescent lines from elements other than fe should also be detectable .",
    "the fluorescent lines of other elements are generally thought to be observationally irrelevant , due to their small yields",
    ". nevertheless , the yields of other elements are not as small as unobservable .",
    "for example , the yield of neutral si k@xmath1 is 0.042 , larger than 10% of that of the neutral fe k@xmath1 .",
    "the fluxes of the fluorescent lines are determined by the chemical abundances , the distribution of the obscuring material , as well as the illuminating intrinsic spectrum of agn .",
    "if detected , the non - fe fluorescent lines can be used to measure the abundances of the cold gas .",
    "a possible example is the _ asca _ observation of ngc 6552 that shows k@xmath1 lines of seven neutral species , which were used to constrain the abundances of the cold gas @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we report the detection of fluorescent lines of neutral si , s , ar , ca , cr , and mn , along with the prominent fe k@xmath1 , fe k@xmath2 , and ni @xmath0lines , from the deep spectrum of the nucleus of m51 ( ngc 5194 ) . known as the whirlpool galaxy , m51 is classified as a liner / seyfert ii galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we see that the spectrum has a significant soft component below 2 kev , which is likely due to the shock - heated gas by the radio jet @xcite . while above 2 kev , the most prominent feature are the emission lines at 6.4 and 7 kev , which are the k@xmath1 and k@xmath2 lines of neutral - like fe .",

    "we find they are exactly corresponding to the k@xmath1 emission lines of neutral si , s , mn , and ni .",
    "therefore , they are most likely due to the fluorescent lines of neutral species as the fe 6.4 kev line .        to measure the observed line fluxes , it is better to use a scattered continuum rather than a powerlaw .",
    "for this purpose , we adopt the mytorus model @xcite , which is based on monte - carlo simulations of a toroidal geometry .",
    "the mytorus model is specified by the incident powerlaw continuum , the equatorial column density , and the inclination angle .",

    "we also add a gaussian line at 6.7 kev , where seems to be a faint  @xmath0line .",
    "to further constrain the continuum model of mytorus , we include the spectrum of m51 into the fitting , which is extracted from a circle region of 75@xmath27 radius as indicated in figure 1 .",

    "the region of 60@xmath27 radius includes most of the extended emission and point sources that contaminate the spectrum .",
    "therefore , besides the model for the nucleus of data , we also assign these two powerlaw models with fixed parameters to the data . the instrument normalization between and is fixed .     for the addition of an emission line for simulated fake spectra of a null hypothesis model including vapec , a continuum , and only fe @xmath0and @xmath31lines .",

    "there are totally about 1200 photons in the spectra and only the @xmath42 kev energy range is used due to the low s / n of the data above 50 kev .",
    "we see that below @xmath43 kev the spectrum is dominated by the ulx indicated in figure 1 , while above that the nucleus dominates .",
    "because the exposure of the observation is short , there are no many photons above 20 kev and the intrinsic spectrum is not well constrained .",
