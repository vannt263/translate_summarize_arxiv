    "extra dimensions , supersymmetry and branes have become a canonical ingredient in physics beyond the standard model and cosmology . in large part , this is due to their motivation from fundamental theories of high energy physics , in particular string theory .",
    "indeed , if string theory is to describe nature , we must explain why only four of the ten or eleven spacetime dimensions have been observed .    in the traditional kaluza - klein picture ,",
    "a four dimensional effective field theory is obtained from a higher dimensional one by compactifying the extra dimensions to a very small size , say , the string scale .",
    "then , the higher dimensional fields can be represented by an infinite tower of 4d kaluza - klein modes , which are essentially harmonics in the internal manifold .",
    "massless modes , such as the 4d graviton , are separated from the massive modes by a finite mass gap .",
    "this renders almost all the modes  and thus the extra dimensions  inaccessible to experiments performed at low energies .",
    "the advent of branes widened our possibilities for hiding the extra dimensions . some fields ( the standard model )",
    "may be confined to a brane in large extra dimensions , in which case we say their wave functions are localized on the brane .",
    "gravity , describing the dynamics of spacetime itself , must of course propagate everywhere .",
    "however , an effective four dimensional gravitational theory can be obtained if the massless mode of the higher dimensional graviton is exponentially enhanced at our brane , whereas the massive modes are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this was shown to happen in the 5d brane world model of randall - sundrum @xcite .",
    "5d brane world models have been extremely well studied .",
    "they are quite special , since the branes represent boundaries in the spacetime .",
    "much of the interesting dynamics is due to the warp factor , which appears when solving the gravitational backreaction of the brane .",
    "it is exponential in the proper distance from the brane .",
    "this gives rise to qualitatively different physics from the traditional kaluza - klein picture , such as the possibility of infinitely large extra dimensions .",
    "the randall - sundrum toy models have by now been realized in more stringy scenarios , and are playing a role in such issues as the moduli stabilization problem , inflation and ads / cft .",
    "indeed , extra dimensions are not only obstacles in our quest to connect string theory to nature . together with branes and supersymmetry",
    ", they also provide new avenues in which to approach some of the long - standing problems of the standard model of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "for instance , the exponential warping induced by codimension one branes , was proposed as a solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "two submillimeter sized extra dimensions were also proposed early on as a way to relate the planck and electroweak scales @xcite , and together with supersymmetry , may even provide a link between that hierarchy and the cosmological constant problem @xcite .    in the following , we review some of our recent work exploring 6d brane models @xcite .",
    "as for 5d , and unlike higher codimensions , the gravitational backreaction of codimension two branes can be solved . in the 5d case , the branes induce step - like singularities in the geometry , whereas in 6d the singularities are conical .",
    "the warping , rather than the exponential behaviour in 5d , is only power law .",
    "we present various background solutions induced by codimension two branes , and study the spectra of small fluctuations near the backgrounds .",
    "this analysis is necessary to establish the stability of the configurations , and also allows one to infer properties of the low energy effective 4d theory , and when and how extra - dimensional physics comes into play .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the gravitational backreaction of codimension two branes , and present the configurations to be studied . in section 3 we outline the strategy for analysing the perturbations , which can actually be applied to more general dimensions and codimensions , and in section 4 we summarize the main physical results for 6d . finally , we conclude , by comparing and contrasting 6d brane models with their 5d cousins and the traditional kaluza - klein models .",
    "we end this introductory section with a few historical remarks .",
    "the idea of a brane world and matter localization on them is rather old and has been discussed in different contexts and with different motivations for more than two decades . in @xcite the localization of fermion zero modes on a u(1 ) vortex",
    "was discussed and similar ideas were applied to the discussion of superconducting cosmic strings in @xcite .",
    "the localization of massless gauge fields on a euclidean 4-brane have even be applied to construct models of chiral fermions on the lattice @xcite , and has been extended to include gravitational fields @xcite .",
    "the application to particle physics and cosmology starts with the papers in @xcite .",
    "a brane in higher dimensional space - time can be introduced with a function , and the world volume coordinates on the brane with @xmath0 . ]",
    "@xmath1 , which represents the position of the brane @xcite . with this function and the bulk metric , @xmath2",
    ", we build the induced metric on the brane , @xmath3 , and we can then write an effective brane action of the form : s_brane = d^4x(-t+ ... ),[sbrane ] where @xmath4 is a constant parameter ( the tension of the brane ) and the dots represent a series of higher derivative terms involving the brane metric and any extra brane localized fields .",
    "the total action is then s_bulk+s_brane .",
    "[ totals]a famous example of this type is the randall - sundrum model @xcite in which @xmath5 is the 5d einstein - hilbert action with cosmological constant , and one or two branes are included .",
    "let us discuss in some more detail the 6d case .",
    "henceforth , we assume that any brane localized matter is integrated out , leaving pure tension branes .",
    "the simplest choice for the bulk action is the 6d einstein - hilbert term s_eh = d^6 x r,[einstein]where @xmath6 is the determinant of the higher dimensional metric , and @xmath7 the 6d planck scale . for @xmath8 , a solution of ( [ totals ] ) with 4d poincar invariance is given by the product of the 4d minkowski space - time and a cone ds^2=_dx^dx^ + dr^2 + ( 1-)^2 r^2 d ^2 .",
    "[ cone]the cone , whose metric is given above in polar coordinates , can be constructed by splicing out a wedge starting from a flat space ( see the example on the left in figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) .",
    "the size of the deficit angle , @xmath9 , is related to the brane physics through = .[deltat]the space remains flat apart from at the apex , where the ricci scalar acquires a delta - function behaviour .",
    "since the deficit angle is bounded from above by @xmath10 , we have an upper bound on the brane tensions that can be described with these mild conical singularities . at the same time",
    ", the solution in ( [ cone ] ) is valid also when @xmath11 .",
    "negative deficit angles are perfectly well defined , and can even be made at home with a piece of paper and a pair of scissors .",
    "a cone with negative deficit angle , which we call saddle - cone , is obtained by splicing a wedge _ into _ a flat space ( see the example on the right in figure [ fig : geodesics ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the deficit angle can even take arbitrarily large negative values .",
    "meanwhile , the instabilities generically associated with negative tension branes may be avoided by placing them on orbifold fixed points , which projects out the unstable `` branon '' modes .    a simple generalization of the bulk action ( [ einstein ] )",
    "is obtained by adding a 6d cosmological constant @xmath12 and yang - mills gauge fields @xmath13 , with field strength @xmath14 : s_bulk = d^6 x ( r --f^2).[sbulk2]this allows for the simplest models of flux compactifications ( relevant in moduli stabilization ) , an example of which is given by the following `` rugby - ball '' solution , in spherical - polar coordinates @xcite : ds^2=_dx^dx^+^2(d^2+^2 ^ 2d^2 ) , = ( 1 ) da_.[sol - rugby - ball]here , @xmath15 is a generator of an abelian subgroup of a simple factor of the gauge group ] .    in order for ( [ sol - rugby - ball ] ) to be a solution to the equations of motion the constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 have to fulfil @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "thus we see that the size of the extra dimensions is fixed .",
    "the metric has two conical singularities at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , with deficit angles @xmath23 , which are sourced by two branes of equal tension as in eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) .    finally , topological arguments , which are explained in figure [ rugby - ball ] and its caption , lead to the so called dirac quantization condition , which for a field interacting with @xmath13 through a charge @xmath24 gives e c n = , where @xmath25 is the gauge coupling constant of the subgroup generated by @xmath15 .",
    "the limit @xmath26 ( which is equivalent to the limit of zero deficit angle or zero tension ) corresponds to a smooth flux compactification on a sphere with radius @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "as motived in the introduction , it is also interesting to consider more sophisticated models , with local supersymmetry in the bulk .",
    "6d chiral gauged supergravity @xcite , with its positive definite scalar potential , provides a supersymmetric version of the einstein - yang - mills systems discussed above .",
    "the bosonic sector includes , additionally , a dilaton @xmath27 and a 2-form field @xmath28 , which emerge from the graviton multiplet and an antisymmetric tensor multiplet @xcite . besides the fermionic fields needed to supersymmetrize this bosonic field content",
    ", one can also add a number of hypermultiplets ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) - with hyperscalars and hyperinos respectively .",
    "the bulk action ( for vanishing hyperscalars ) is then s_bulk=&&d^6x \\{-e^/2f^2 -e^h_mnp h^mnp - e^-/2 } + & & + fermion terms , [ sb ] where h_mnp = _ m b_np + f_mna_p - _ m(a_n _ p ) + 2 cyclic perms , [ hkr]and @xmath31 is the gauge coupling of the @xmath32 gauged r - symmetry .",
    "the chiral fermions present in the theory generically lead to gravitational and gauge anomalies , which can sometimes be cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism @xcite .",
    "this places an attractive restriction on the matter content of the model , and in table [ anomalyfree ] we give some examples of the anomaly free models that have been discovered .",
    ".some examples of anomaly free models with gauge groups containing @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "there are also many other models @xcite .",
    "[ anomalyfree ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the source of the instability is the monopole flux in a non - abelian gauge sector , and it is to be found also in smooth sphere compactifications @xcite .",
    "it turns out that models that are stable for the sphere , are also stable in the presence of positive tension branes .",
    "this includes all models in which the monopole is embedded in an abelian gauge group , even if they are non - supersymmetric .",
    "curiously , the introduction of negative tensions can render an unstable monopole flux stable .",
    "possible endpoints of these instabilities have been studied in @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed the physics of 6d brane worlds , focusing on the background geometries that they induce and the behaviour of their perturbations . in the series of papers @xcite we developed a fairly comprehensive analysis of the perturbations in ( warped )",
    "brane world compactifications of 6d chiral supergravity .",
    "the techniques developed could also applied to other scenarios , with different dimensions and codimensions .",
    "our results show that the behaviour of bulk fluctuations in 6d brane worlds , with positive tensions , is much the same as in traditional kaluza - klein compactifications . moreover , the power law warping that appears in 6d changes the physics little with respect to unwarped models .",
    "instead , models with negative tension branes can lead to new physics . in table",
    "[ summary ] we provide a summary , which compares and contrasts the behaviour amongst kaluza - klein models , 5d randall - sundrum like models and the 6d models discussed here .",
