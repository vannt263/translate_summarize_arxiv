    "bose - einstein condensation of mixtures of different atomic species has recently been the subject of an intensive experimental and theoretical research @xcite .",
    "the first experimental realization of a system of two interacting bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has been obtained at jila with a double condensate of @xmath0rb in two different hyperfine states , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this mixture was characterized by a partial overlap between the two condensates , in presence of a gravitational `` sag '' due to the different magnetic moment . since then",
    "several other experiments have been performed with double condensates of rubidium @xcite and with spinor condensates of sodium in optical traps @xcite .    motivated by these experiments and by the future possibility of realizing other binary mixtures of interacting becs , these systems have been extensively studied also from the theoretical point of view . up to now",
    "only two particular cases have been addressed : _",
    "( i ) _ a system of two condensates with different mass in cylindrically symmetric potentials arranged concentrically @xcite , and _",
    "( ii ) _ including a gravitational sag , but for condensates with the same mass ( the jila case ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend these studies by considering the very general case of two different atomic species , with different mass and in different hyperfine states , trapped in a magnetic potential whose eigenaxes can be tilted with respect to the direction of gravity .",
    "we show that , despite the complicated geometry , the ground - state of the system can be easily characterized within the thomas - fermi approximation valid for large numbers of atoms .",
    "we provide general formulas which allow to calculate the shape and the density distributions of the two becs .",
    "our results can be a useful tool to analyze future experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : model ] we discuss the equations for the ground state of the system and show that upon an appropriate coordinate transformation , they can be put in a very simple spherical form . in section [ sec : tf ] we discuss the general features of the model , and we give an explicit algorithm to classify all the different topologies which can be constructed by varying the number of atoms and the inter - atomic scattering length .",
    "we also work out some example for the case @xmath0rb and @xmath3k , which is a promising system for the realization of a new binary mixture of becs @xcite .",
    "finally we compare the results against the numerical solution of the full gross - pitaevskii equations for the system , finding a good agreement .",
    "let us consider a system of two bose - einstein condensates with mass @xmath4 and in the hyperfine state @xmath5 , each containing @xmath6 atoms ( @xmath7 ) , confined in a magnetic trap .",
    "the ground state of the system can be obtained by solving two coupled gross - pitaevskii equations for the condensate wave - functions @xmath8",
    "@xcite @xmath9\\psi_1=\\mu_{1}\\psi_1 \\label{eq : gpe1}\\ ] ] @xmath10\\psi_2=\\mu_{2}\\psi_2 \\label{eq : gpe2}\\ ] ] with the normalization condition @xmath11 the coupling constants @xmath12 are given in terms of the scattering length @xmath13 by @xcite @xmath14 where we used the fact that @xmath15 .",
    "hereinafter we assume @xmath16 , @xmath17 .    the total potential experienced by each condensate is the sum of the gravitational potential and of a dipole magnetic potential @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the gyro - magnetic factor of the specie @xmath20 ) which we assume , as usual , to be harmonic @xmath21 by defining @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 we can finally write @xmath25 in the standard form @xmath26 for what concerns the gravitational potential , here we consider the general case in which the vertical direction ( the direction of gravity ) is not aligned with any of the symmetry axis of the trap , but lies in the @xmath27 symmetry plane , rotated by an angle @xmath28 .",
    "we include this possibility since in the experiments the trap confinement is generally weaker along the horizontal direction @xmath29 , and therefore even a small angle can produce a large `` horizontal sag '' ; we will give explicit examples in the following section @xcite .",
    "the total potential is @xmath30    by performing an appropriate transformation on the coordinates the potential @xmath31 can be put in a simpler form",
    ". these transformations amount to    * a scaling by @xmath32 ( notice that the determinant of the transformation is equal to one ) @xmath33 in order to put @xmath34 in a spherically symmetric form ; * a rotation of an angle @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) in order to align the @xmath37 axis with the vertical direction @xmath38    the transformed potential reads ( to simplify the notations in the following we omit the apices , @xmath39 ) @xmath40 where we have defined @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xmath43 where the scaling factor @xmath44 is given by @xmath45    then we perform a translation along @xmath46 by @xmath47 , defining @xmath48 , and we express all quantities in dimensionless units , rescaling lengths by @xmath49 and energies by @xmath50 .",
    "finally , the expressions for the trapping potential that will be used in the rest of the paper are @xmath51 with @xmath52    to summarize , in this section we have shown that with suitable transformations the trapping potential for the two condensates can be reduced to a simple spherical form .",
    "this allows for a much easier investigation of the features of the interacting system , as will be discussed in the following section .",
    "for large number of atoms @xmath6 the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gpe1])-([eq : gpe2 ] ) can be derived in the so called thomas - fermi approximation which amounts to neglecting the kinetic terms @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , by reabsorbing the values @xmath54 of the potentials on their minima in the definition of the chemical potentials , @xmath55 , the above equations become @xmath56 where the reduced coupling constants @xmath12 are @xmath57    by defining @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tf1])-([eq : tf2 ] ) in the overlapping region take the form @xmath61 where we have defined the radii @xmath62 @xmath63 the position of the centers along @xmath46 @xmath64 and the normalization factors @xmath65 @xmath66 notice that in order to have overlap between @xmath67 and @xmath68 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : over1])-([eq : over2 ] ) have both to be satisfied , that is both right members must be positive ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the overlapping region between the two condensates is therefore the intersection of the regions of space delimited by the spherical surfaces @xmath70 defined by the equation @xmath71 , and identified by the sign of the coefficient @xmath65 : for @xmath72 the region to be considered is the one inside the surface @xmath70 , for @xmath73 the one outside .    in the regions",
    "where there is not overlap the wave functions take the usual form @xmath74 analogously to the overlapping case , these solutions are defined in a region of space whose boundary is delimited by the surfaces @xmath75 of equation @xmath76 , with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "notice that in order to satisfy the continuity condition of the wave function @xmath8 at the interface between the overlapping and non - overlapping regions the wave function @xmath81 must be connected to @xmath67 at the boundary defined by @xmath82 ( where @xmath83 vanishes , but not @xmath84 ) , and vice - versa .",
    "even though a self consistent solution of the full problem can be obtained only after having imposed the normalization of the wave functions , we can draw some general considerations by considering the role played by the determinant @xmath85 and the coupling @xmath86 .",
    "first of all we define the value of @xmath86 at which the determinant @xmath85 change sign , @xmath87 .",
    "then we notice that the behavior of the position of the centers along @xmath46 , @xmath88 , and the normalization factors @xmath65 of the overlapping wave functions depends on two critical values @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which define the poles of @xmath88 and the zeros of @xmath65 ( the latter have poles also for @xmath91 . it is not difficult to prove that one of this two values lies in the interval where @xmath92 , and the other outside .",
    "therefore , to fix the hierarchy of the scattering lengths we choose the condensate 1 in order to satisfy the condition @xmath93 ; with this choice the critical value lying in the interval of positive @xmath85 is @xmath94 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : centri ] and [ fig : alpha ] we show the position of the centers @xmath88 and the normalization factors @xmath65 as a function of @xmath86 .",
    "notice that in correspondence of @xmath95 the center @xmath96 of the surface @xmath97 goes from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , and the normalization factor @xmath100 becomes negative .",
    "therefore for @xmath101 the region where @xmath102 is the one outside the surface @xmath97 ( see also figs . [",
    "fig : topology]c , g ) .",
    "we can distinguish three cases :    * @xmath103 , @xmath104 : no overlapping solution is allowed in this range . from fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] we see that both @xmath65 are negative , and therefore it is not difficult to prove that an overlapping region could be constructed only at the price of putting an hole in the condensate , where both @xmath105 would be vanishing .",
    "this has obviously no physical meaning and in fact what actually happens is that when @xmath86 approaches @xmath106 the condensates eventually collapse @xcite .",
    "* @xmath107 , @xmath92 : in this range the two condensate can coexist and overlap in some region of space if @xmath108 .",
    "we will discuss in detail the actual degree of overlap and its topology in the next section .",
    "* @xmath109 , @xmath104 : in this case the strong mutual repulsion leads to a phase separation between the two condensates @xcite .",
    "the actual shape of the interface is determined by the one at the critical value @xmath110 . since for this value",
    "the overlap goes to zero ( in the tf approximation ) , if one further increases @xmath86 the shape of the interface can not change .    of course , if one retains the kinetic term in the gp equations this can in part affect the degree of overlap between the two condensates .",
    "in particular the transition to the phase separation regime is not so sharp : the condensates can have an appreciable overlap also for @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the kinetic energy is also to raise the critical value below which the system collapses .      in this section",
    "we investigate the different configurations which can be obtained in the case ( ii ) discussed above ( @xmath92 , @xmath107 ) . before solving completely the system for some particular set of parameters , we give an overview of the different topologies that one can obtain .",
    "we again distinguish three cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ]    * `` external overlap '' : this case can take place when the separation @xmath112 between the centers is larger than the difference of the radii of the non - interacting profiles , @xmath113 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : topology]a - d ) .",
    "one can easily verify that all the four surfaces @xmath70 and @xmath75 intersect on a circle perpendicular to the plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] , passing for the points p and q ( shown as black dots ) . the overlapping region is the one contained between the surfaces @xmath114 and @xmath97 ( dashed lines in the figure ) whose actual shape depend on @xmath86 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] for @xmath115 ( a ) , @xmath116 ( b ) , @xmath101 ( c ) , and @xmath117 which is a case of phase separation ( d ) . for smaller",
    "@xmath118 one obtains other configurations , which fall in the next two classes . * `` full overlap '' : in this case , for @xmath119 , one of the two condensates is entirely contained into the other with whom it is fully overlapping .",
    "[ fig : topology]e - f for @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively . which of the two condensates lies in the outer shell depends the actual value of the parameters @xcite .",
    "* `` partial overlap '' : this is similar to the case ( 2 ) , but now the overlap take place over a shell which separates the inner core containing the condensate 1 , and the outer region with the condensate 2 ( fig . [",
    "fig : topology]g ) .",
    "notice that according to the above discussion this configuration is possible only for @xmath101 where the sign of @xmath100 is negative .",
    "this is a necessary but not sufficient condition , since also the condition @xmath120 must be satisfied . in this range of @xmath86 ( where @xmath121 ) another possible solution is @xmath122 , which leads to the case ( 2 ) . by further increasing @xmath86 to the critical value @xmath110 one again obtain a configuration of phase separation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : topology]h ) .",
    "having determined the possible configurations of the system , we are now ready to solve any particular problem by imposing the normalization condition ( [ eq : norma ] ) . to do",
    "this one has to write the normalization integrals for each of the possible profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] , and then solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : norma ] ) in order to find the chemical potentials @xmath123 as a function of the atom numbers @xmath6 .",
    "the analytic expressions for these integrals are given in appendix [ app : integral ] .",
    "these are polynomial functions of fractional powers in the chemical potentials @xmath123 , and in general eq .",
    "( [ eq : norma ] ) does not admit analytical solutions .",
    "therefore the relation between @xmath123 and @xmath6 must be inverted numerically ( which is nevertheless a much easier task than solving numerically the full gross - pitaevskii problem ) .",
    "for the special case of phase separation the two normalization equations can be decoupled ( by using the fact that @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath117 ) , and solved analytically for @xmath126 .",
    "notice that in general ( except for some particular case , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath126 ) it is not possible to know _ a priori _ which of the various configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] applies : one has to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : norma ] ) for all the possible configurations , and then choose the one which gives a self - consistent solution .    in summary the ground state configuration for a particular system can be found in three steps :    * choose the normalization integrals which applies to the possible profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] for a given @xmath86 , and determine @xmath127 by solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : norma ] ) self - consistently ; * identify the overlapping region by plotting the `` interacting '' surfaces @xmath70 ; * determine the non - interacting region for each condensate by using the `` non - interacting '' surfaces @xmath75 , and the continuity of the wave functions ( see fig . [",
    "fig : topology ] ) .",
    "we also remind that for the very special case @xmath126 there are also symmetry breaking solutions , not included in the present analysis , which could be energetically favorable @xcite .      to give some explicit example we now consider two condensates of @xmath0rb and @xmath3k , which is a promising system for the realization of a new binary mixture of becs @xcite .",
    "we will classify some possible configurations which can be obtained by varying the number of atoms in each condensate , for different values of the inter - atomic scattering length , which is considered here as a tunable parameter @xcite .",
    "the results , valid in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , will be compared with the numeric solution of the full-3d gross - pitaevskii equations ( gpe ) , found using a steepest descent method @xcite .",
    "we start by considering a case of `` external overlap '' with both condensates in the hyperfine level @xmath2 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the scattering lengths are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , @xmath131 being the bohr radius @xcite . as trap frequencies we use @xmath132hz , @xmath133hz , with an angle of rotation @xmath134 ( we retain these values for all the cases analyzed in this section ) . with this choice",
    "the reduced coupling constant @xmath135 are @xmath136 and therefore , according to the above discussion , we identify the condensates 1 with @xmath0rb , and the condensates 2 with @xmath3k .",
    "we choose a case attractive interaction between the two condensates , @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) , with @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "to visualize the role of the scaling and rotation transformations , in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] we show the tf profiles of the two condensates in the @xmath27 plane , in rescaled ( left ) and natural coordinates ( the coordinate axes correspond to the trap eigenaxes ; right ) .",
    "the profiles in natural units can be easily obtained by performing the inverse transformation of those in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) and ( [ eq : rotation ] ) .",
    "we will use this system of coordinates to show all the following figures .",
    "notice that despite the small rotation angle @xmath28 , ( the direction of gravity , represented by a dotted line in the right picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : rotation ] , is almost indistinguishable from the @xmath46 axis on the scale of the figure ) the misalignment in the direction of gravity produces a relatively large horizontal sag in the @xmath29 direction where the trap confinement is weak .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex - ext ] we compare the tf profiles with the contour plot of the two densities , as found from the full gpe solution . for clarity each condensate",
    "is plotted separately , and compared with the tf profiles which define the boundary of the non - interacting ( continuous lines ) or overlapping phases ( dashed lines ) , as defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] . the outer contour line for each condensate",
    "correspond to @xmath141 of its peak density ( for @xmath142 ) .",
    "then we consider two examples for a system where the @xmath0rb condensate is in the hyperfine level @xmath2 and the @xmath3k condensate in @xmath143 ( we use again @xmath144 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath145 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex - part ] we show a case of `` partial overlap '' , obtained by fixing the inter - atomic scattering length to @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) and the number of atoms to @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "notice that when both condensates are in the @xmath2 level the spatial separation between the two is too large to allow for a configuration of `` partial overlap '' for reasonable values of the trap frequencies ( in principle one could reduce the separation by strongly increasing the confinement in the direction of gravity ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex - full ] we show a case of `` full overlap '' for @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , giving @xmath153 .    from the examples considered here we see that , although the full solution of the gpe is required for a precise determination of the actual degree of overlap between the two condensates , the tf approximation well captures the basic topology of the ground state configurations .",
    "therefor , due to its simplicity , the tf method presented here can be a useful tool to characterize the ground state structure of a binary mixture of becs also in presence of a non trivial geometry .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that we have also verified that our method well reproduces the results already studied in literature in case of simpler geometries @xcite .",
    "we have presented a general method to classify the ground - state of a binary mixture of bose - einstein condensates . we have considered the general case of of two different atomic species , with different mass and in different hyperfine states , trapped in a magnetic potential .",
    "we have explicitly included the possibility of a non trivial gravitational sag , when the direction of gravity is not aligned with any of the trap eigenaxes , since even a small misalignment can produce a large `` horizontal sag '' .",
    "we have shown that , within the thomas - fermi approximations and by performing a suitable coordinate transformation , the equations for the density distributions can be put in a simple spherical form .",
    "we have given explicit rules to classify the different spatial topologies which can be produced , and we have discussed how the behavior of the system is influenced by the inter - atomic interaction .",
    "we have also provided explicit examples , and compared the results with the full numeric gross - pitaevskii calculation , finding a good agreement .",
    "the results presented in this paper might be useful for analyzing future experiments where new combinations of binary condensates are likely to be produced @xcite .",
    "we acknowledge useful discussion with g. modugno and g. roati .    after having completed this work we became aware of a very recent preprint related to this subject @xcite .",
    "in this appendix we give the explicit expressions for the integrals which enter the normalization condition ( [ eq : norma ] ) .",
    "we distinguish two general cases : ( i ) `` internal overlap '' one of the two condensates is entirely contained into the other ( fig .",
