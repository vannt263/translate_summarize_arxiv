    "recently , anomalous diffusion equations have been extensively investigated due to the broadness of their physical applications .",
    "in fact , fractional diffusion equations and the non - linear fractional diffusion equations have been successfully applied to several physical situations such as percolation of gases through porous media [ 1 ] , thin saturated regions in porous media [ 2 ] , in the transport of fluid in porous media and in viscous fingering[3 ] , thin liquid films spreading under gravity [ 4 ] , modeling of non - markvian dynamical processes in protein folding [ 5 ] , relaxation to equilibrium in system ( such as polymer chains and membranes ) with long temporal memory [ 6 ] , anomalous transport in disordered systems [ 7 ] , diffusion on fractals [ 8 ] , and the multi - physical transport in porous media , such as electroosmosis[9 - 10 ] .",
    "note that the physical systems mentioned above essentially concern anomalous diffusion of the correlated type ( both sub and super - diffusion ; see [ 11 ] and references therein ) or of the lvy type ( see [ 12 ] and references therein ) .",
    "the anomalous correlated diffusion usually has a finite second moment @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to super - diffusion , normal diffusion and sub - diffusion , respectively ; @xmath3 corresponds basically to localization ) . due to the broadness of the problems involving anomalous diffusion",
    ", one needs to apply different kinds of theoretical approaches such as nonlinear fokker - planck equation ( or modified porous media equation ) , fractional fokker - planck equation , fokker - planck equation with spatial dependent diffusion coefficient , and generalized langevin equations .",
    "the properties concerning these equations have been intensively investigated [ 13 - 17 ] and the lattice boltzmann method was used to get the numerical solutions for this equations which govern the multi - physical transfort in porous media .    in order to cover the above situations , we employ a spatial time - dependent diffusion coefficient , in other words , our work is aimed at the investigation of solutions for a fractional diffusion equation taking a spatial time - dependence on the diffusion coefficient and an external force ( drift ) into account .",
    "more precisely , we focus our attention on the following equation : @xmath4^{\\nu}\\}-\\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}x}\\{f(x)\\rho(x , t)\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath6 , which is a spatial time - dependent diffusion coefficient , and @xmath7is an external force ( drift ) associated with the potential @xmath8 . here",
    ", we use the caputo operator [ 18 ] for the fractional derivative with respect to time @xmath9 , and we work with the positive spatial variable @xmath10 .",
    "later on , we will extend the results to the entire real @xmath10-axis by the use of symmetry ( in other words , we are working with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "also , we employ , in general , the initial condition @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is a given function ) , and the boundary condition @xmath15 . for eq.(1 ) , one can prove that @xmath16 is time independent ( hence , if @xmath17 is normalized at @xmath18,it will remain so forever ) .",
    "indeed , if we write eq.(1 ) as @xmath19 , and , for simplicity , assume the boundary conditions @xmath20 , it can be shown that @xmath16 is a constant of motion ( see [ 19 ] and references therein ) .",
    "note that when @xmath21 , eq.(1 ) recovers the standard fokker - planck equation in the presence of a drift taking memory effects into account . the particular case @xmath22 ( no drift ) and @xmath23 with @xmath24 has been considered by spohn [ 20 ] .",
    "the case @xmath25 with @xmath26 and the case @xmath27 with @xmath26 have been investigated in [ 21 ] and [ 22 ] , respectively .",
    "explicit solutions play an important role in analyzing physical situations , since they contain , in principle , precise information about the system .",
    "in particular , they can be used as an useful guide to control the accuracy of numerical solutions .",
    "for these reasons , we dedicated to this work to investigate the solutions for eq.(1 ) in some particular situations .",
    "in all the particular cases , eq.(1 ) satisfies the initial condition @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is a given function ) , and the boundary condition @xmath28 .",
    "the remainder of this paper goes as follow . in sec.2",
    ", we obtain the exact solutions for the special cases . in sec.3",
    ", we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we start our discussion by considering eq.(1 ) in the absence of external force with @xmath29 ( @xmath30),@xmath26 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 arbitrary . for this case , eq.(1 ) reads @xmath33 here , we use the caputo operator [ 18 ] for the fractional derivative with respect to time @xmath9 . by employing the laplace transform in eq.(2 )",

    "this equation can be solved by green function method [ 23 ] . by substituting @xmath39 into eq.(3 ) which yields @xmath40 where @xmath41 subjects to the initial condition @xmath42 and the boundary condition @xmath43 .    in order to solve eq.(5 ) , it is convenient to perform the transform [ 24 ] @xmath44 to translate eq.(5 ) into the second - order bessel equation as @xmath45 with parameter @xmath46 under the following conditions : @xmath47^\\frac{1}{2},\\lambda=\\frac{1+\\theta}{2+\\theta},\\delta=\\frac{1+\\theta}{2+\\theta}.\\ ] ] since eq.(5 ) should fit the boundary condition @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath48 , we get the solution of eq.(5 ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the modified bessel function of second kind ; and @xmath51 can be determined by the normalization of @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 . after some calculations , we obtain @xmath54 where , we used the formula @xmath55    * case 1 .",
