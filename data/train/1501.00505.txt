    "this article presents an adaptive control strategy for 4-dof manipulator , where some dynamical parameters of a manipulator are considered not to be known precisely .",
    "also it is considered that there is no way to measure these parameters other than start controlling and trying to determining precise values of parameter while manipulator executing some tasks .",
    "so , the proposed controlling strategy must have integrated online recursive parameter identification .    to derive the strategy , first the kinematics of manipulator is explained .",
    "the kinematics is necessary to derive then inverse dynamics equations of manipulator , which are then used then to implement adaptive torque controller .",
    "the final section of this article is dedicated to simulation and testing of the proposed strategy .",
    "there are number of adaptive control strategies described in literature ( see [ lewis , 2011 ] ) .",
    "but the distinguishing feature of the proposed strategy is that it focuses on identification of parameters that are related to position of centers of masses in manipulator bodies .",
    "a normal way to describe robot kinematics is to use danavit and hartenberg parameters .",
    "the given robot manipulator represent an anthropomorphic leg .",
    "four degrees of freedom are distributed in the following way three revolute joints combined into one in foundation of the hip , and one revolute joint in the knee .",
    "the three combined revolute joints act as spherical joint in hip of a human for instances . in real robotic manipulators it would be possible to merge \" all three joints into points , and",
    "they have to be separated by some physical links .",
    "but since this the target of the work was to simulate adaptive control strategy , and merging all of them into one simplifies derivation of robot dynamics greatly , it was decided to merge them into 3-dof z - y - x joint with zero length links .",
    "table 1 contains the dh parameters of the robot .",
    "further the straightforward equations of robot kinematics are given .",

    "is given below .",
    "robot dynamics is derived using lagrangian - euler mechanics .",
    "lagrange s equation of motion for a conservative system are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a vector of generalized forces , @xmath17 is a joint variables vectors , @xmath18 is kinetic energy of the system , @xmath19 is a potential energy .",
    "a more standard form of manipulator dynamics is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the inertia matrix , @xmath22 is coriolis / centripetal vector , and g(q ) is the gravity vector .    for the given kinematics of a robot",
    "the lagrangian can be derived by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25    at the end @xmath26      to implement parameter identification algorithm , the manipulator dynamics has to be parametrized linearly .",
    "the goal of this project to design a strategy that would adapt to uncertain model parameters , which are center of masses of linked bodies in manipulator .",
    "it is not possible to factor out positions if center of masses from the inverse dynamic of a manipulator directly , as the dynamics equation is non - linear in relation to coordinates of center of masses .",
    "however it is possible multiple these nonlinear terms to some parameters and through this was to adjust inverse dynamics equation of the system .",
    "so then @xmath27 can be factored as @xmath28 where @xmath29 lets introduce set of parameters @xmath30 so we can parametrize @xmath31 as @xmath32 so the parametrarized inverse dynamics looks like : @xmath33      in foundation of the described control strategy lays a computed torque controller . a idea behind a computed torque controller is to cascade non - linear system with its inverse so the overall system has constant unity gain . in practice",
    "the inverse is not perfect so a feedback loop is required to deal with errors .",
    "the computed torque controller is given by : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are position and velocity gains matrices , @xmath37 is position error .",
    "the recursive least squares algorithm is used for parameter estimation . as it is the easiest way most reliable way for parameter estimation in the proposed control strategy .",
    "@xmath38 or at some @xmath39-th step : @xmath40 so the rls scheme can be expressed in the following steps : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 the rls parameter estimation was implemented as a part of a model controller .",
    "the figure [ fig : simcontrol ] is actual simulink model of controller and simulated manipulator .",
    "the central block called `` interpreted matlab fcn '' is matlab implementation of robot inverse dynamics together with rls parameter estimation .",
    "this block is implemented using persistent variables used to memorize one step ahead @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath1 values of rls estimator .",
    "the described control strategy was tested on a matlab simulink model .",
    "the reference model of manipulator was powered by peter corke s robotics library , which is based on recursive newton - euler articulated body algorithm .",
    "the torque controller was computed symbolically from lagrangian of a manipulator that had slightly different inertial parameters than reference model .",
    "the built simulink model has the following features :    @xmath44 and @xmath45 are fixed at some values , that were learned empirically by looking at optimal controllability and stability of reference model .",
    "the output of controller is discretized using zoh , at a rate of 100hz .",
    "the reference trajectory is generated by interpolation between two joints space states    the implemented simulink model is show on the picture [ fig : simcontrol ] .        2",
    "the number of simulations were performed that shown that presented control strategy is viable and stable enough . in number of experiments",
    ", model parameters converged to some fixed valued .",
    "however the presented strategy has to be researched much further than the author was able to do for the project to conclude fully about effectiveness of the proposed strategy ."
