    "now if @xmath31 is a graded commutative differential algebra whose cohomology is connected and finite type , there is a unique ( up to isomorphism ) minimal algebra @xmath27 with a quasi - isomorphism @xmath32 .",
    "the differential graded algebra @xmath27 is then called the ( sullivan ) minimal model of @xmath31 .    in @xcite sullivan associated to each nilpotent space @xmath7 a graded commutative differential algebra of rational polynomials forms on @xmath7 , @xmath33 , that is a rational replacement of the algebra of de rham forms on a manifold .",
    "the minimal model @xmath27 of @xmath34 is then called the minimal model of @xmath7 .",

    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a space @xmath0 is called ( rationally ) formal if its minimal model , @xmath27 , is quasi - isomorphic to its cohomology with differential @xmath35 , @xmath36 a formal space @xmath0 admits a minimal model equipped with a bigradation on @xmath22 , @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , and such that the bigradation induced on the homology satisfies @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "this model has been constructed by halperin and stasheff in @xcite , and is called the bigraded model of @xmath0 .",
    "we will use this model for the proof of theorem 2 .    a nilpotent space @xmath0 is called ( rationally ) elliptic if @xmath41 and @xmath42 are finite dimensional vector spaces .",
    "to be elliptic for a space @xmath0 is a very restrictive condition .",
    "for instance @xmath42 satisfies poincar duality and @xmath43 is zero for @xmath44 @xmath45 dim@xmath46 .",
    "a nilpotent space @xmath0 is called ( rationally ) hyperbolic if @xmath41 is infinite dimensional and @xmath42 finite dimensional .",
    "the homotopy groups of elliptic and hyperbolic spaces have a completely different behavior .",

    "suppose that @xmath48 is the sullivan minimal model of @xmath0 .",
    "denote by @xmath49 a supplement of the subvector space generated by the cocycles .",
    "then @xmath50 is an acyclic differential graded ideal , and the quotient @xmath51 is a finite dimensional model for @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath52 the dual coalgebra .",
    "let @xmath53 , @xmath54 be a graded basis for @xmath18 with @xmath55 and denote by @xmath56 the dual basis for @xmath57 .",

    "proves that there is a unique differential @xmath60 on @xmath61 making @xmath62 a morphism of differential graded algebras .",
    "then @xmath63 is a model for @xmath2 and @xmath64 is a model for the evaluation map @xmath65 . in particular , ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the rational homotopy groups of @xmath2 are given by @xmath66\\,.\\ ] ] this formula is natural in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in @xcite thom computes the rational homotopy type of @xmath67 when dim@xmath68 .",
    "he proves that the mapping space is a product of eilenberg - maclane spaces , @xmath69 since odd dimensional spheres are rationally eilenberg - maclane spaces , it follows that if @xmath1 has the rational homotopy type of a product of odd dimensional spheres , then @xmath2 is formal .",
    "suppose now that @xmath2 is formal .",
    "since any retract of a formal space is formal , @xmath1 is formal . by theorem 2",
    ", the image of the hurewicz map for @xmath2 is finite dimensional .",
    "recall that for a formal space , the cohomology is generated by classes that evaluate non trivially on the image of the hurewicz map .",
    "therefore the algebra @xmath70 is finitely generated .",
    "the square of an even dimensional generator @xmath71 of @xmath70 gives a map @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "we denote by @xmath74 the product of those maps , @xmath75 we do not suppose that @xmath76 .",
    "in fact if @xmath77 for all @xmath78 , then @xmath74 is homotopically trivial but this has no effect on our argument .",
    "the pullback along @xmath74 of the product of the principal fibrations @xmath79 is a fibration @xmath80 by construction the rational cohomology of @xmath81 is finite dimensional , and so the rational category of @xmath81 is also finite .",
    "now from the definition of the dimension of @xmath0 , there is a cofibration @xmath82 such that @xmath83 is surjective .",
    "the restriction to @xmath84 induces a map @xmath85 whose homotopy fiber is the injection @xmath86 from the naturality of the formula for the rational homotopy groups of a mapping space , we deduce that @xmath87 is injective .",
    "denote now @xmath88 the pullback of @xmath89 along @xmath90 , @xmath91 since @xmath92 is injective , it follows from the mapping theorem @xcite that the rational category of @xmath88 is finite . in particular the cup length of @xmath88",
    "is finite .    now",
    "the rational cohomology of @xmath93 is the free commutative graded algebra on the graded vector space @xmath94 , with @xmath95 .",
    "therefore if @xmath1 is hyperbolic , @xmath96 will contain a free commutative graded algebra on an infinite number of generators , and in particular its cup length is infinite .",
    "it follows that @xmath1 is elliptic . to end the proof we only apply yamaguchi result ( @xcite ) that asserts that when @xmath1 is elliptic , and @xmath2 is formal , then @xmath1 has the rational homotopy type of a finite product of odd dimensional spheres .",
    "denote by @xmath27 the bigraded model for @xmath1 and by @xmath31 a connected finite dimensional model for @xmath0 .",
    "connected means that @xmath97 .",
    "denote as above by @xmath98 , an homogeneous basis of @xmath18 , and by @xmath56 the dual basis for @xmath99 .",
    "we write also @xmath100 .",
    "we consider the differential ideal @xmath104 , and we denote by @xmath105 the quotient map . in @xmath106",
    "the equation @xmath107 gives for each @xmath108 the equation @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the derivation of @xmath111 defined by @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "to go further we specialize the basis of @xmath114 .",
    "we denote by @xmath115 a basis of @xmath116 , by @xmath117 a set of cocycles such that @xmath118 is a basis of the cocycles in @xmath18 .",
    "finally we choose elements @xmath71 with @xmath119 .",
    "a basis of @xmath18 is then given by @xmath120 and the elements @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "denote then by @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 the derivations @xmath126 associated respectively to @xmath122 , @xmath71 and @xmath127 .",
    "then we have @xmath128 @xmath129      consider now in @xmath134 a cocycle @xmath135 of the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a decomposable element",
    ". looking at the linear term of @xmath138 we obtain that @xmath139 .",
    "we can replace @xmath135 by @xmath140 to cancel the linear part @xmath141 .",
    "we can thus suppose that @xmath135 has the form @xmath142 where @xmath137 is a decomposable element .    in @xmath106",
    ", @xmath135 decomposes into a sum of cocycles , @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "let fix some @xmath78 .",
    "we write @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "we denote @xmath147",
    ". then the component @xmath148 is isomorphic to @xmath149 and @xmath150 is equipped with an isomorphism of degree @xmath151 , @xmath152 we extend @xmath153 in a derivation of @xmath154 by @xmath155 , and the differential @xmath156 satisfies @xmath157 .",
    "write @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .",
    "we show that in that case @xmath160 is a cocycle .",
    "if this is true for any @xmath78 , this implies that the map @xmath161 is zero in degrees @xmath44 dim@xmath162 .",
    "since @xmath163 is the dual of the hurewicz map @xmath164 , this implies the result .",
    "we now follow the lines of the proof given for @xmath165 by dupont and vigu - poirrier in @xcite .",
    "write @xmath166 , and denote by @xmath167 a graded basis of @xmath168 .",
    "we denote by @xmath169 the derivation of degree @xmath170 defined by @xmath171        write @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 with @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "then @xmath185 @xmath186 therefore @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xmath189 this implies that @xmath190 is a cocycle . in particular , @xmath191 and is a cocycle .",
