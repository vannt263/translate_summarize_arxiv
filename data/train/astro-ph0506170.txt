    "the dense molecular clouds lead to strong star formation activity , which also results in the formation of binary systems , and subsequently to x - ray binary systems .",
    "these objects show x - ray flares and outbursts because of accretion processes onto the compact object . at the same time , the gas and dust of the spiral arms absorb most of the emission in the optical to soft x - ray regime below 10 kev .",

    "even though igr  j162834838 was in the partially coded field of view of ibis , the analysis gave a @xmath22 detection within 96 ksec with a flux of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the low flux level of the source did not allow the extraction of a spectrum from the isgri data and no simultaneous soft - x and optical observations are available as igr  j162834838 was always outside the field of view of _ integral _ s x - ray monitor jem - x and of the optical monitor omc .",
    "no further _ integral _ observations of the source were obtained .      after the discovery of igr  j162834838 a _ swift _",
    "follow - up observation was requested in order to obtain an x - ray spectrum and an optical measurement .",
    "the _ swift _ mission @xcite is a multiwavelength observatory for gamma - ray - burst astronomy .",
    "the payload combines a gamma - ray instrument ( burst alert telescope , 15 - 150 kev ; barthelmy et al .",

    "two _ swift _ observations took place 3 and 5 days after the last _ integral _ observation .",
    "the first one started on april 13 , 14:02 u.t . with an exposure time of 2.5 ksec , which resulted in an effective _ swift_/xrt exposure of 550 sec .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the xrt data refined the position of igr  j162834838 to @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( j2000.0 ) with an estimated uncertainty of 5 arcsec radius @xcite .",

    "these tools are included in the release of heasoft 6.0 as of april 12 , 2005 . applying a centroid algorithm to the data of april 15",

    "the @xmath20 upper limit for the fe k@xmath37 line at 6.4 kev is @xmath38 with an equivalent width of @xmath39 .",
    "because of the short exposure time the source was not detected by the bat instrument .",

    "the _ rxte_/pca has a large field of view ( @xmath40 fwzm ) . for targets near the galactic plane , a significant amount of galactic diffuse emission enters the pca aperture , which is considered background .",

    "this observation is at a similar latitude as igr  j162834838 , so the diffuse emission should have nearly the same spectrum .",

    "the shape of the background template was fixed and added to the spectral model of the two pca observations of igr  j16283 - 4838 ; only the total normalization of the template was allowed to vary .",

    "unfortunately the @xmath18 upper limit does not constrain the sed significantly . note that we display in the sed the absorbed x - ray fluxes as they are measured at the observer , as most of the absorption appears to be intrinsic to the source .",
    "the situation is different in the optical where the flux is absorbed already significantly by material in the line of sight .",
    "the hydrogen column density in the direction of the source is @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to an extinction of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "therefore the unabsorbed optical limit is @xmath58 and outside the displayed range of figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the absorption has a lower effect on the near - infrared fluxes . with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) the unabsorbed flux values are @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "the extinction in the mid - infrared range is negligible .",
    "the new hard x - ray source igr  j162834838 exhibits several characteristic features .",
    "igr j162834838 is located at galactic longitude @xmath65 and latitude @xmath66 arcmin in the norma arm region .",
    "it shows a strong flare within a time scale of days .",
    "the absorption is of the order of @xmath67 with variations by a factor of 4 within one day and a flat x - ray spectrum ( @xmath68 ) during all observations .",
    "the bimodal spectral energy distribution has one peak probably in the near - infrared and the other in the hard x - rays .",
    "the equivalent width of the iron k@xmath37 line is @xmath39 ( @xmath69 ) and no optical counterpart is detectable ( @xmath70 ) , probably because of absorption in the line of sight .    combining this information enables us to put constraints on the nature of the source . the position within the galactic plane at only @xmath66 arcmin makes a galactic origin of the source likely , even though some agn have been seen through the plane by _ integral _ , like the seyfert 1 galaxy grs 1734 - 292 @xcite . strong variability as observed in igr  j162834838 has been seen in the x - ray spectra of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. dewangan et al .",
    "2002 ) , but the x - ray spectrum is too flat ( @xmath68 ) for a seyfert galaxy .",
    "this would still leave the possibility of a blazar as counterpart .",
    "but the absorption by the galaxy in the direction of the source ( @xmath56 ) is not high enough to explain the intrinsic absorption of @xmath71 , and thus intrinsic strong absorption in the blazar would be required to explain the _",
    "swift_/xrt spectrum , but this has not been seen so far in blazar spectra .    if we consider igr  j162834838 to be a galactic source , mainly two types of bright and variable hard x - ray emitters are likely to be a counterpart : low mass and high mass x - ray binaries , lmxbs and hmxbs , respectively .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum with strong absorption indicates the presence of a hmxb in which no pulsation have been detected so far @xcite .",
    "also the bright infrared emission , if connected to the x - ray source , would indicate a massive star as the companion of the compact object .    for a hmxb it is likely that igr  j162834838",
    "is located close to a star forming region in a galactic spiral arm . along the line of sight towards the source several arms",
    "are located @xcite : the sagittarius - carina arm ( 0.7 kpc ) , the scutum - crux arm ( 3.2 kpc ) , the norma - cygnus arm ( 4.8 kpc ) , a star - forming region ( 7 kpc ) , and the perseus arm ( 10.8 kpc ) .",
    "the luminosity of the object during the flare can be estimated by taking the brightest stage during the _ rxte _ observation and assuming a distance to the object between 1 and 10 kpc .",
    "the unabsorbed flux is in this case only 20% larger than the absorbed one , because the significant part of the luminosity is emitted in the hard x - rays .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is then in the range @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is in units of @xmath74 ) .",
    "the quiescent luminosity of the system is at least a factor of @xmath75 lower with @xmath76 .",
    "this range of values is consistent with measurements from known be / x - ray binaries with a neutron star as the compact object @xcite . in any case the luminosity is far below the eddington luminosity of a neutron star of @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) .    the properties of igr  j162834838 are similar to those of a number of highly absorbed sources ( @xmath79 ) found in the galactic plane , especially in the norma arm region @xcite .",
    "the hmxb igr  j19140 + 0951 shows also strong variable absorption @xcite , indicating intrinsic absorption in the source .",
    "the observed properties of igr  j162834838 are consistent with those of igr  j19140 + 0951 in the bright state , where the iron line flux decreased to @xmath80 , which is at the upper limit for the _ swift_/xrt measurement in our case .",
    "the ( non-)variability of the absorption in igr  j163184848 is still under discussion , as walter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) claim constant absorption , whereas revnivtsev ( 2003 ) discovered variable absorption which could be connected with the orbital phase of the binary system .",
    "only one of the newly detected highly absorbed sources has been claimed so far not to be a hmxb .",
    "patel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observed igr  j163584726 with _",
    "chandra_. from the x - ray data they favour the source to be a millisecond pulsar lmxb even though the hmxb interpretation can not be ruled out completely , though it would require some unknown kind of spin - down torque to prevent the neutron star from spinning up in this particular case .",
    "x - ray binaries with strong intrinsic absorption have been known already before _ integral _ , for example in 4u 1700 - 377 , gx 301 - 2 , vela x-1 , and ci cam . except for the latter one , where the nature of the source is unclear to date , these sources are also hmxbs , likely to host a neutron star as the compact object .",
    "vela x-1 shows variable absorption from a negligible value up to @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "gx 301 - 2 shows strong absorption variation ( up to @xmath82 ; white & swank  1984 ) , and so does ci cam ( @xmath83 ; boirin et al .",
    "2002 ) . in 4u 1700 - 377 the absorption",
    "is linked to the state of the hmbx system and varies by a factor of 2 between 0.9 and @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "it appears that variable absorption is a common feature in highly absorbed hmxbs .",
    "this could mean that the absorbing material is linked to the existence of a high mass donor in the binary system . in this case",
    "a strong and dense stellar wind ( @xmath85 to @xmath86 ) from the early - type stellar companion will probably cause the absorption in the system .",
    "the fact that all the absorbed sources so far have shown to be hmxbs @xcite containing neutron stars does not rule out significant contribution of hmxbs with a black hole as the compact object .",
    "but these systems are expected to be less numerous than the neutron star hmxbs by a factor of 10 to 100 , making the detection of a black hole binary within a sample of only about 10 detected highly absorbed hmxbs unlikely .",
    "these absorbed binary systems might provide a significant contribution to the galactic hard x - ray background at energies above 10 kev @xcite .",
    "the newly discovered hard x - ray source , located in the norma arm region , is likely to be a hmxb containing a neutron star as the compact object .",
    "it is located in the galactic plane in the direction of star forming regions in the spiral arms and shows a large flare , which makes an extragalactic origin unlikely .",
    "the spectrum is hard ( @xmath1 ) and strongly absorbed during the flare , which indicates a hmxb rather than a lmxb .",
    "the luminosity is comparably low ( @xmath87 ) which is typical for a neutron star hmxb .",
    "the strong and variable absorption ( @xmath67 ) indicates that igr  j162834838 belongs to the class of highly absorbed hmxbs discovered by _",
    "integral _ along the galactic plane .",
    "bright and absorbed sources like igr  j162834838 could contribute significantly to the galactic hard x - ray background in the 10200 kev band .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the discovery and classification of igr  j162834838 would not be possible without combining the observations of the recent observatories in space , like _ integral _ , _ swift _ , _ rxte _ , and _",
    "spitzer_. combined efforts from these missions should lead to deeper insights into the nature of the hard x - ray source population in our galaxy in the near future .",
