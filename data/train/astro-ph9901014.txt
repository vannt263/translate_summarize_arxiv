    "six years ago the @xmath11-dmr experiment detected anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) on angular scales @xmath12 ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ; wright et al . 1992 ; bennett et al . 1996 ; grski et al . 1996 ) .",

    "these observations are becoming an increasingly powerful tool for testing cosmogonies and constraining cosmological parameters such as @xmath1 , @xmath13 , and @xmath2 in these models is the nonrelativistic - mass density parameter , @xmath13 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath14 , and @xmath2 is the baryonic - mass density parameter . ] .",
    "while definitive results will probably have to await new data acquired at a variety of frequencies to constrain or estimate possible non - cmb anisotropy foreground emission , it is of interest to explore what constraints current data place on cosmological model parameters . given the error bars associated with current measurements , interesting constraints on cosmological model parameters require simultaneous use of many data sets in this exploration .",
    "two distinct techniques have been used to combine results from different data sets .    in the first approach , a goodness - of - fit (  @xmath15 \" ) comparison of cmb anisotropy predictions , which depend on model parameters , and observational results",
    "is used to constrain cosmological model parameters ( e.g. , ganga , ratra , & sugiyama 1996 ; hancock et al .",
    "1998 ; lineweaver et al . 1997",
    "; lineweaver & barbosa 1998 ; baker et al .",
    "this comparison does not make use of the complete data from each experiment .",
    "rather , it typically uses a single number ( amplitude of a predefined cmb spectrum ) with error bars , derived from the rms anisotropy measured by the experiment . as a consequence it is an easily used technique that allows for a rapid exploration of cosmological parameter space . on the other hand",
    "it does have a number of significant drawbacks , some of which are discussed , most recently , by bond , jaffe , & knox ( 1998 ) and by tegmark ( 1998 ) . in particular , the amplitude ( and error bars ) used to represent the data is model dependent  this is typically a @xmath16 effect for current data sets with good detections ( ganga et al .",
    "1997a , hereafter grgs ; ganga et al . 1998",
    "; ratra et al . 1999 , hereafter r99 ) .",
    "this is not accounted for in the @xmath15 analyses , since they use an amplitude ( and error bars ) extracted from the data on the basis of an assumed flat bandpower spectrum or gaussian autocorrelation function .",
    "more importantly , these amplitudes and error bars are derived from quite nongaussian posterior probability density distribution functions . as a result",
    "the observational error bars are quite asymmetric and symmetrizing (  gaussianizing \" ) them in different ways results in different @xmath15 values ( ganga et al . 1996 ) .",
    "note that gaussianization is mandatory , not optional , for the @xmath15 technique .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath15 technique , as currently applied , can not account for observational upper limits . as discussed below , at least one upper limit ( suzie )",
    "significantly constrains cosmological parameter space .",
    "in addition , when assigning confidence limits on cosmological parameters to the constant @xmath15 bounds , proponents of the @xmath15 technique assume that the resulting probability distribution is a gaussian function of the cosmological parameters , which is not true .",
    "given these drawbacks it is clear that one should not rely solely on the @xmath15 technique for quantitative constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we note , however , that the technique does qualitatively establish that the cmb anisotropy spectrum has more power on smaller angular scales ( ganga et al .",
    "1996 ) , consistent with recent saskatoon observations ( netterfield et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the second and more correct approach ,",
    "a joint maximum likelihood analysis of all the data sets using realistic model anisotropy spectra , is very time consuming .",
    "this approach has been used to constrain cosmological parameters on the basis of a single data set ( bunn & sugiyama 1995 ; grski et al . 1995 , 1998 ;",

    "stompor 1997 ; ratra et al .",
    "1998 ; r99 ) , and a combination of three data sets ( bond & jaffe 1997 ) . such analyses use the full information in each data set , rather than the single amplitude with error bars used in the @xmath15 analyses .    in this paper",
    "we combine results from earlier analyses of the gundersen et al .",

    "( 1994 ) argo hercules data .",

    "1997b , 1998 ; ratra et al . 1998 ; r99 ) .",
    "since these data sets were acquired from regions that are well separated in space , the likelihoods of the individual data sets are independent and can thus be multiplied together to construct the likelihood of the combined data set .",
    "this combined likelihood is then used to derive constraints on cosmological model parameters .",
    "our analysis here is complementary to that of bond & jaffe ( 1997 ) .",
    "they consider the dmr , ucsb south pole 1994 , and saskatoon data sets and develop a method to constrain cosmological parameters , while we focus here on a larger number of smaller angular scale data sets . to cut down on complexity",
    ", we do not consider the dmr data in this paper .",
    "different ways of dealing with the quadrupole moment in the dmr analysis lead to significantly different constraints on cosmological parameters ( grski et al .",
    "1998 ) , so a proper treatment would require consideration of at least two different sets of dmr results , leading to a significant increase in the number of data set combinations ( since we consider various combinations of the small - scale data sets ) and a proliferation of figures .",
    "we also want to first focus on the constraints from smaller angular scale data , and , in particular , compare results from different combinations of the small - scale data sets .",
    "while we consider fewer model parameters than did bond & jaffe  for instance , we do not allow for tilt , gravity waves , or hot dark matter  we explore , in a systematic way , a much broader range for the model parameters considered .",

    "1995 ; liddle et al . 1996",
    "; cole et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in passing , we note that most of these observations can probably be reconciled with a time - variable cosmological  constant \" dominated spatially - flat model ( e.g. , peebles & ratra 1988 ; sugiyama & sato 1992 ; ratra & quillen 1992 ; coble , dodelson , & frieman 1997 ; ferreira & joyce 1997 ; caldwell , dave , &   steinhardt 1998 ; viana & liddle 1998 ; frieman & waga 1998 ; anderson & carroll 1998 ; zer & taha 1998 ; huterer & turner 1998 ; starobinsky 1998 ) .    on the other hand , recent applications of the apparent magnitude versus redshift test using type ia supernovae favor the flat-@xmath0 model ( e.g. , riess et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we emphasize that some , if not most , of the above constraints are very tentative .",
    "they should be viewed as indicative as what may soon be possible , and are certainly not definitive .    in the analyses in this paper we focus on a spatially open cdm model and a spatially flat cdm model with a @xmath0 .",
    "these models have gaussian , adiabatic primordial energy - density power spectra .",
    "the flat-@xmath0 model cmb anisotropy computations use a scale - invariant energy - density perturbation power spectrum ( harrison 1970 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) , as predicted in the simplest spatially - flat inflation models ( guth 1981 ; kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , 1981b ) .",

    "these effects are unlikely to be very significant in viable open models although they could help reconcile some flat-@xmath0 model predictions with the observations . more specifically ,",
    "while we do not use goodness - of - fit statistics in this paper to check whether the favored cosmological parameter values derived here are a good fit to the data , @xmath15 analyses have qualitatively shown that some of the models in the four - dimensional parameter space we study in this paper are indeed a good fit to the data , possibly better than should be expected ( ganga et al .",
    "1996 ; lineweaver & barbosa 1998 ; tegmark 1998 ) .",
    "that is , current data does not require consideration of a larger dimensional parameter space .",
    "in addition , we note that constraints on model parameters from each of the individual data sets used in this paper are largely mutually consistent .",
    "the computation of the anisotropy spectra is described in stompor ( 1994 ) and sugiyama ( 1995 ) .",
    "we have evaluated the spectra for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval 0.1 to 1 in steps of 0.1 , for a range of @xmath9 spanning the interval 0.005 to 0.029 in steps of 0.004 , and for a range of @xmath4 spanning the interval 10 to 20 gyr in steps of 2 gyr .",
    "see r99 for further details .",
    "figure 1 shows examples of the model cmb anisotropy spectra used in our analyses .",
    "other examples are shown in figure 2 of r99 .",
    "we consider various combinations of ten different data sets .",
    "the data sets we use are the ucsb south pole 1994 ka and q band observations , hereafter sp94ka and sp94q ( gundersen et al .",
    "1995 ; grgs ) , the argo hercules observations ( de bernardis et al . 1994 ; r99 ) , the max 4 @xmath6 draconis ( i d ) and @xmath10 herculis ( sh ) and max 5 hr5127 ( hr ) , @xmath41 pegasi ( mp ) , and @xmath42 herculis ( ph ) observations ( tanaka et al .",

    "; ganga et al . 1998 ) , the white dish observations ( tucker et al . 1993 ; ratra et al . 1998 ) , and the suzie observations ( church et al . 1997 ; ganga et al .",
    "detailed information about these data sets may be found in the papers cited above ; in what follows we discuss only directly relevant issues .    amongst the experiments we consider ,",
    "the suzie observations probe the smallest angular scales . in some models suzie is still quite sensitive to multipoles @xmath43 ( ganga et al .",
    "1997b ) . on these angular scales",
    "a number of effects not accounted for in our cmb anisotropy power spectra computations can modify the primordial cmb anisotropy power spectra .",
    "we therefore consider combined data sets both including and excluding the suzie observations , so as to bias our conclusions as little as possible .",
    "multifrequency data sets , such as sp94 and max 4 and 5 , allow for an  internal \" estimate of the amount of non - cmb anisotropy foreground contamination .",
    "in this sense they are  better \" than single frequency data sets .",
    "besides the well - known spectral analysis method for checking for foreground contamination , some multifrequency data sets allow one to use sample variance and noise considerations to check for consistency of the data with cmb anisotropy ( grgs , pp . 1921 ) .",
    "the method is as follows ; see grgs for a detailed discussion and grgs and ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for applications of the method .",
    "if systematic uncertainties ( such as those in the beamwidth , calibration , or pointing ) are small , the deduced @xmath40 error bars only account for noise and sample variance .",
    "assuming that the data is pure cmb anisotropy , when individual channel observations are combined , the noise contribution to the error bars will integrate down in known fashion while the sample variance contribution will not ( since the sky coverage does not change ) .",
    "since the behavior of the noise part of the error bars is known , comparing the error bars derived from each of the individual channel observations to those derived from the combined data allows for an estimate of the sample variance directly from the data .",
    "if this estimate of the sample variance is consistent with that estimated independently from the observing strategy and parameters of the instrument , it is reasonable to conclude that the data is not inconsistent with cmb anisotropy .",
    "spectral analyses and simple analytic sample variance estimates indicate that the sp94ka and max 5 hr data are more consistent with what is expected for cmb anisotropy than are the sp94q and max 5 ph data ( grgs ; ganga et al .",
    "1998 , also see tanaka et al .",
    "1996 ) . while the max 5 ph observations were done at lower balloon altitude and so through more of the atmosphere ( tanaka et al .",
    "1996 ) , and while there is indication of a possible non - cmb foreground in other q band observations made at saskatoon ( de oliveira - costa et al . 1997 ) , it is useful to improve on the simple analytic sample variance estimates of grgs and ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to see if their conclusions are justified .    to improve upon these estimates",
    "we have generated 1000 monte carlo maps of the flat bandpower cmb anisotropy in a flat two - dimensional space .",
    "we then mimic the sp94 and max 4 and 5 observational techniques and  observe \" these noise - less simulations .    for the sp94 ka and q observations we find sample variances of 23% and 22% of the bandtemperature , estimated at the central beamwidths , as in the grgs sample variance estimate .",
    "these are larger than the 21% and 18% estimated by grgs on the basis of the simple analytic formula . however , the conclusions of grgs are unaffected .",
    "that is , given these new numerical estimates of sample variance , the sp94ka data is still more consistent with what is expected for cmb anisotropy than is the sp94q data .    for max 5",
    "we find a sample variance of 23% , estimated at beamwidth @xmath44 , as in the ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sample variance estimate .",
    "this is larger than the ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) analytic estimate of 19% . however , this is not large enough to affect the ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) conclusion that the max 5 hr error bars are more consistent with what is expected for cmb anisotropy than are the max 5 ph ones .",
    "we also note that max 5 mp data has structure that correlates with @xmath45 100 @xmath41 m dust emission ( lim et al .",
    "since the max 4 sh error bars do not significantly shrink when the individual channel observations are combined , while the max 4 i d error bars do , ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded that the max 4 sh data was not that consistent with what is expected for cmb anisotropy , while max 4 i d could be .",
    "on the basis of these , admittedly weak , arguments , we therefore also analyze the combination of sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr data .",
    "these are multifrequency observations with error bars consistent with what is expected for cmb anisotropy on the basis of sample variance and noise considerations .",
    "more precisely , these three data sets are the only ones ( amongst those considered in this paper ) for which we have no basis to suspect foreground contamination . in this sense",
    "this is a conservative combination of data .",
    "we emphasize , however , that some or all of the other data sets could also be purely cmb anisotropy , since our arguments do not establish the contrary at a convincing statistical level .",
    "we emphasize that a proper treatment would require a complete analysis of each individual data set , accounting for a cmb anisotropy signal as well as various non - cmb foreground signals .",
    "since there almost certainly are uncharacterized non - cmb foregrounds , this is likely to be a difficult undertaking .    in summary ,",
    "then , we consider three different combinations of data sets : i ) all data ( sp94 , argo , max 4 and 5 , white dish , and suzie ) ; ii ) all data excluding suzie ; and iii ) sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr data .",
    "grgs describe the computation of the likelihood function for a given cmb anisotropy data set .",
    "offsets and gradients removed from the data are accounted for in the analysis .",
    "beamwidth and calibration uncertainties are also accounted for as described in grgs .",
    "the likelihood functions for the individual data sets considered in this paper were recomputed in r99 , for the much larger set of cosmogonical model spectra considered here .",
    "the initial models - based analyses , except for argo , used only 25 model spectra ( ratra et al . 1997 ) , in contrast to the 798 considered here .",
    "since the data sets considered are well separated in space , and in some cases also in angular resolution , the likelihood functions of the individual data sets are simply multiplied together to construct the likelihood function of the combined data .",
    "these open and flat-@xmath0 model likelihoods are a function of four parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath1 , @xmath9 , and @xmath4 .",
    "marginalized likelihood functions are derived by integrating over one or more of these parameters .",
    "we assume a uniform prior in the parameters integrated over , set to zero outside the parameter range considered .    to determine central values and limits from the likelihood functions we assume a uniform prior in the relevant parameter .",
    "then the corresponding posterior probability density distribution function vanishes outside the chosen parameter range and is equal to the likelihood function inside this range .",
    "the deduced central value of the parameter is taken to be the value at which the posterior probability density peaks , and we quote highest posterior density ( hpd ) limits .",
    "see grgs and r99 for details .",
    "the quoted limits depend on the prior range considered for the parameter .",
    "this is a significant effect if the likelihood function is not sharply peaked within the parameter range considered , as is the case for a number of the likelihood functions derived in this paper .",
    "see r99 for a more detailed discussion of this issue .",
    "for the flat bandpower spectrum , the posterior distribution for the combined data peaks at @xmath46k , with a 1 @xmath10 range of @xmath47 , resulting in an averaged fractional 1 @xmath10 uncertainty of 8.9% , and with likelihood ratio = 0 @xmath41k .",

    "these numerical values account for beamwidth and calibration uncertainties , and the removal of offsets and gradients when appropriate . clearly",
    ", these combined data sets result in very significant detections of cmb anisotropy , even after known systematic uncertainties are accounted for .",
    "we emphasize that the most conservative combination ( sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr ) has a lower amplitude than the other two data combinations , but it is not significantly lower . also , while this most conservative combination of data has a larger error bar , 19% , qualitatively consistent with a smaller amount of data , adding additional data to that considered here should result in a considerably smaller error bar .",
    "for comparison , the corresponding dmr error bar is @xmath55 ( depending on model , grski et al .",
    "1998 ) .    as for argo ( r99 ) , for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models ,",
    "the four - dimensional posterior probability density distribution function @xmath56 is nicely peaked in the @xmath40 direction but fairly flat in the other three directions ( especially in the @xmath9 and @xmath4 directions ) .",
    "again as for argo ( r99 ) , marginalizing over @xmath40 results in a three - dimensional posterior distribution @xmath57 which is steeper .",
    "since the limits determined from the four- and three - dimensional posterior distributions are not highly statistically significant , we do not show detailed contour plots of these functions here .",
    "however , the vertical heavy solid lines in figure 8 show the formal 1 @xmath10 and 2 @xmath10 confidence limits derived by projecting the appropriate four - dimensional posterior distribution on to the @xmath40 axis . these limits are reasonably close together in the @xmath40 direction , illustrating the steepness of the four - dimensional posterior distribution in this direction .",
    "marginalizing over @xmath40 and one other parameter results in two - dimensional posterior probability functions which are more peaked .",
    "some examples are shown in figures 24 .",
    "again as for argo ( r99 ) , in some cases these peaks are at an edge of the parameter range considered .",
    "figures 24 illustrate a number of interesting points , some of which we return to below when we discuss the posterior distribution obtained by marginalizing over one more parameter , i.e. , the posterior distributions for each of the four parameters .",
    "figure 4 shows results in the @xmath58 plane for the open model and the individual max 4 i d , max 5 hr , and sp94ka data sets , as well as the combined sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr data set .",
    "panels @xmath59 show that the contours of the posterior distribution in the @xmath1 direction for these three individual data sets look like rescaled ( in @xmath40 ) versions of each other .",
    "this is partly because the three experiments probe similar angular scale parts of the model cmb power spectra , the multipole @xmath60 rise towards the first peak , which are only weakly dependent on @xmath1 ( see figure 1 ) , and partly because the data error bars are large . as a result ,",
    "when one does a joint analysis of the three data sets the contours in the @xmath40 direction are closer together while those in the @xmath1 direction do not shift as significantly .",
    "thus a combined analysis of the data sets results in tighter limits on @xmath40 but not significantly stronger constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "this effect has previously been noticed by grgs , bond & jaffe ( 1997 ) , ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and r99 .",
    "grgs found that when the sp94 ka and q data were jointly analyzed the limits on @xmath40 were somewhat tighter than those derived from the ka or q data alone while the combined data did not better differentiate between different @xmath1 values than did the individual data sets .",
    "ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also drew attention to this effect in their joint analysis of the max 4 and 5 data .",
    "figure 5 of r99 shows posterior density distribution contours in the @xmath58 plane for the dmr , sp94 , argo , max 4 and 5 , white dish , and suzie data .",
    "bond & jaffe ( 1997 ) use the amplitude of mass fluctuations at 8@xmath19 mpc , @xmath61 , instead of @xmath40 , and show posterior density distribution contours in the @xmath62 and @xmath63 planes instead of the plots we show .",
    "( here @xmath64 is the primordial energy - density perturbation power spectral index . )",
    "they consider the combination of the dmr , sp94 , and saskatoon data , and point out that since the dmr data does constrain @xmath64 fairly well ( grski et al .",
    "1996 ) but not @xmath13 ( e.g. , grski et al .",
    "1998 ) , the combination of dmr , sp94 , and saskatoon data does constrain @xmath64 fairly well , but not @xmath13 . a similar constraint on @xmath1 in the open models at low @xmath1 ( as that on @xmath64 )",
    "would be expected from the suzie data ( and to a lesser extent from the dmr data )  see figure 5 panels @xmath65 and @xmath66 of r99 , and figure 3 panels @xmath66 and @xmath67 of this paper .",
    "figure 2 shows that the two - dimensional posterior distributions allow one to distinguish between different regions of parameter space at a fairly high formal level of confidence .",
    "for instance , for the sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr data combination ( panels @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the bottom row ) , the open model near @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 gyr , and the flat-@xmath0 model near @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath72 gyr , are both formally ruled out at @xmath75 @xmath10 confidence . however , we emphasize , as discussed below , care must be exercised when interpreting the discriminative power of these formal limits , since they depend sensitively on the fact that the uniform prior has been set to zero outside the range of the parameter space we have considered .",
    "figure 3 shows the contours of the two - dimensional posterior distribution for @xmath40 and @xmath1 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional distribution over @xmath9 and @xmath4 .",
    "these are shown for the three combined small - scale data sets and the dmr data , for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models . at 2 @xmath10 confidence ,",
    "constraints on these parameters derived from the three combined small - scale data sets are mostly consistent with those derived from the dmr data",
    ". however , at a lower level of significance , the dmr data favor a higher normalization for the flat-@xmath0 model than do the combined small - scale data sets , see panels @xmath76 , @xmath68 , and @xmath77 of figure 3 .",
    "it is interesting that the constraints on @xmath40 derived from the dmr data are not much tighter than those derived from the combined small - scale data sets .",
    "a similar conclusion has previously been drawn from the max 4 and 5 data alone ( ganga et al .",
    "1998 ) and the argo data alone ( r99 ) . as mentioned above , excluding suzie from the combined small - scale data set results in an increase of the allowed low-@xmath1 region for the open model , see panels @xmath66 and @xmath67 of figure 3 .",
    "figure 5 shows the one - dimensional posterior distribution functions for @xmath1 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional ones over the other three parameters . for the flat-@xmath0 model ( left hand column of figure 5 ) ,",
    "all three combinations of data sets favor @xmath78 , although no value of @xmath1 is ruled out since the distributions are quite flat . including or excluding the suzie data , panels @xmath76 and @xmath68 , hardly changes the posterior distribution for the flat-@xmath0 model .",
    "this is mostly a consequence of the fact that the flat-@xmath0 models do not predict much cmb anisotropy power on the angular scales probed by suzie ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the results for the open model ( right hand column of figure 5 ) are dramatically different . using all the data , panel @xmath66 , @xmath78",
    "is favored , with , formally , @xmath79 at 1 @xmath10 , 2 @xmath10 , and 3 @xmath10 confidence , respectively .",
    "excluding suzie , panel @xmath67 , significantly shifts the most likely value to @xmath80 .",
    "considering only the sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr combination , panel @xmath69 , the most favored open model is at @xmath81 with @xmath82 formally excluded at 1 @xmath10 and @xmath83 formally excluded at 2 @xmath10 .",
    "as mentioned above , and discussed in the analysis of the argo data ( r99 ) , care is needed when interpreting the discriminative power of these formal limits .",
    "if the posterior density function was a gaussian which peaked well inside the parameter range considered , the 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath10 hpd limits would correspond to a value of the posterior distribution relative to that at the peak of 0.61 , 0.14 , and 0.011 respectively . using this criterion ,",
    "the posterior distribution of figure 5@xmath66 , for the open model and all the small - scale data , sets a 2 @xmath10 confidence limit of @xmath84 and a 3 @xmath10 confidence limit of @xmath85 .",
    "this gaussian posterior ratio criterion also results in a 1 @xmath10 confidence limit of @xmath86 for the open model and the sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr combination , panel @xmath69 .",
    "this criterion does not result in 1 @xmath10 limits for any of the other panels .    to summarize , the most conservative constraints follow from the sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr data combination , figure 5 panels @xmath77 and @xmath69  the most favored value is @xmath87 for the open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model , with @xmath88 excluded at 1 @xmath10 for the open model and no constraint on the flat-@xmath0 model if the gaussian posterior distribution ratio criterion is used .",
    "that is , even using this most conservative prescription a 1 @xmath10 limit can be set on @xmath1 in the open model , and the most favored open model is somewhat more favored than the most favored flat-@xmath0 one .",
    "while the inclusion or exclusion of the suzie data do not significantly affect the flat-@xmath0 models constraints , panels @xmath76 and @xmath68 of figure 5 or panels @xmath76 and @xmath68 of figure 3 , it does significantly affect the open model constraints , panels @xmath66 and @xmath67 of figure 5 or panels @xmath66 and @xmath67 of figure 3 , shifting the most likely value of @xmath1 from 1 to 0.3 . since the suzie data only results in an upper limit ( church et al .",
    "1997 ; ganga et al .",
    "1997b ) , it is not straightforward to include it in a conventional goodness - of - fit @xmath89 analysis .",
    "this is a drawback of the conventional @xmath15 technique .",
    "it is of interest to compare the constraints on @xmath1 in the open model from the combined sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr analysis with what has been derived from @xmath15 analyses which include much more data .",
    "as mentioned above , we find , from figure 5@xmath69 , that @xmath81 is the most favored value , with the conservative gaussian posterior distribution ratio upper limit of @xmath86 at 1 @xmath10 and no constraint at 2 @xmath10 .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the ganga et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xmath15 analysis conclusion that @xmath90 is favored .",
    "it is also not inconsistent with the baker et al .",
    "( 1998 ) values @xmath91 at 2 @xmath10 , where we have simply doubled their 1 @xmath10 error bars .",
    "however , it seems to be difficult to reconcile this with the lineweaver & barbosa ( 1998 ) conclusion that @xmath92 at more than @xmath93 @xmath10 confidence ( if @xmath94 ) .",
    "this difference could be due to a number of effects .",
    "it could be due to the fact that we have considered only a small number of data sets .",
    "another possibility is the different numerical values ascribed to some of the data sets in the two analyses .",
    "for instance , recent reanalyses ( grgs ; ganga et al . 1997b , 1998 ; ratra et al .",
    "1998 ; r99 ) of some of the data , which more carefully accounts for systematic effects , has altered a number of data points , some quite significantly . yet",
    "another possibility is that some of the data sets considered in the @xmath15 analysis but not in this paper are inconsistent with the data sets considered here , for the restricted four - dimensional parameter space we have studied .",
    "this , however , does not seem very likely since @xmath15 analyses have resulted in very low reduced @xmath15 values for some of the models considered here , indicating that in this restricted parameter space the data sets are qualitatively consistent with each other given the error bars ( ganga et al . 1996 ; lineweaver & barbosa 1998 ; tegmark 1998 ) .",
    "given that the field is still rapidly evolving , such differences are not unexpected .",
    "figure 6 shows the one - dimensional posterior distribution functions for @xmath9 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional ones over the other three parameters .",
    "for both the flat-@xmath0 and open models , and for all combined data sets considered , a low @xmath95 is favored .",
    "while formal 2 @xmath10 confidence upper limits exist ( see figure 6 ) , the constraints derived from the gaussian posterior distribution ratio criterion discussed above are much weaker and do not rule out any value of @xmath9 .",
    "inclusion or exclusion of the suzie data do not significantly affect the deductions in this case .    while not very significant , it is gratifying that the cmb anisotropy data favor lower @xmath9 , consistent with a number of recent estimates using different techniques , which disfavor @xmath9 larger than @xmath96 ( e.g. , fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ; levshakov , kegel , & takahara 1998 , but",
    "also see burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "this low value for @xmath9 is also consistent with the indications from the ganga et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xmath15 analysis .",
    "however , it differs from the lineweaver & barbosa ( 1998 ) favored high value of @xmath97 .",
    "figure 7 shows the one - dimensional posterior distribution functions for @xmath4 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional ones over the other three parameters .",
    "for both the flat-@xmath0 and open models , and for all combined data sets considered , a young universe , @xmath98 gyr is favored . again , while formal 2 @xmath10 confidence upper limits exist ( see figure 7 ) , constraints derived from the gaussian posterior distribution ratio criterion are much weaker , although they are stronger than for the case of @xmath9 .",
    "these 1 @xmath10 constraints are : for all the data and the open model , panel @xmath66 , @xmath99 gyr ; for all the data excluding suzie and the open model , panel @xmath67 , @xmath100 gyr ; and for the sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr combination , panels @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath69 , @xmath101 gyr ( @xmath102 gyr ) , for the flat-@xmath0 ( open ) models .",
    "inclusion or exclusion of the suzie data do not dramatically affect the deductions in this case .",
    "again , while not highly significant , it is gratifying that the cmb anisotropy data favor a young universe , consistent with other recent estimates ( e.g. , feast & catchpole 1997 ; reid 1997 ; gratton et al .",
    "1997 ; chaboyer et al .",
    "lower @xmath4 corresponds to larger @xmath13 .",
    "hence these results would seem to be consistent with the indications for large @xmath13 from the ganga et al .",
    "( 1996 ) @xmath15 analysis .",
    "they also seem to be consistent with the open model values of @xmath103 favored by lineweaver & barbosa ( 1998 ) and baker et al .",

    "( 1998 ) .    figure 8 shows the one - dimensional posterior distribution functions for @xmath40 , derived by marginalizing the four - dimensional ones over the other three parameters .",

    "they are consistent with the dmr results for both the open and flat-@xmath0 models",
    ". however , at a lower level of confidence the dmr data favor a somewhat higher normalization for the flat-@xmath0 model than do the small - scale data sets .",
    "this is consistent with indications from other data ( e.g. , stompor et al .",

    "; cole et al .",

    "the peak values of the one - dimensional posterior distributions shown in figures 58 are listed in the figure captions for the case when the four - dimensional posterior distributions are normalized such that @xmath105 . with this normalization ,",
    "marginalizing over the remaining parameter the fully marginalized posterior distributions are , for the open ( flat-@xmath0 ) models : @xmath106 for all the data ; @xmath107 for all the data excluding suzie ; and , @xmath108 for the sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr combination .",
    "we have derived constraints on cosmological model parameters in the open and flat-@xmath0 cdm models , from joint analyses of combinations of the sp94 , argo , max 4 + 5 , white dish , and suzie cmb anisotropy data sets .",
    "the favored value of @xmath1 in the open model depends sensitively on which combination of data is used . to determine",
    "if this is significant will require a models - based analysis of a larger number of data sets .",
    "constraints on @xmath1 in the flat-@xmath0 model , and constraints on @xmath9 and @xmath4 in both models , are only weakly dependent on the data set combination considered .    in the most conservative case ,",
    "i.e. , for the sp94ka , max 4 i d , and max 5 hr data set combination , an open ( flat-@xmath0 ) model with @xmath109 is favored .",

    "this is in agreement with recent determinations based on other techniques .",
    "it is gratifying that the small subset of current cmb anisotropy data considered in this paper can place some constraints on cosmological parameters . while these are mostly not very statistically significant , they are largely consistent with results determined using other , non - cmb anisotropy , measurements . to derive tighter and more robust constraints on cosmological parameters",
