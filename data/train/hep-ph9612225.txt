    "the astronomical observations indicate that there exist more baryons than antibaryons in our universe .",
    "this baryon asymmetry of the universe may be understood within the framework of physics at the electroweak scale @xcite , since all the necessary ingredients for baryogenesis could be available there @xcite .",
    "although the standard model ( sm ) does not account for the asymmetry quantitatively , certain extensions of the sm would be able to overcome those difficulties which the sm encounters .",
    "this possibility could give some hints for physics beyond the sm .",
    "in particular , it turned out that cp violation in the sm arising from the kobayashi - maskawa phase does not lead to an enough amount of asymmetry between the numbers of baryons and antibaryons",
    ". the baryon asymmetry could be a unique phenomenon ever found , other than the  system , which enables us to study cp violation .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the possibility of baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition in the supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) .",
    "this model @xcite , which is one of the most plausible extensions of the sm from the viewpoint of physics at the electroweak scale , contains new sources of cp violation @xcite wanted for the baryogenesis .",
    "in addition , the electroweak phase transition may be strongly first order in the ssm , which is also necessary for the baryogenesis though not compatible with the higgs boson mass in the sm . indeed , the constraints on the higgs boson masses from this requirement could be relaxed @xcite compared to the sm , owing to the richness of higgs fields , especially by adding a gauge singlet field",
    ". it would be thus of great importance to study whether the electroweak baryogenesis is viable in the ssm .",
    "the baryogenesis at the electroweak phase transition could occur within or outside the bubble wall of the broken phase , where baryon number violation by electroweak anomaly is not suppressed .",
    "we consider the baryon number generation outside the wall , which has been suggested to give an enough amount of asymmetry in the ssm @xcite . for this process",
    "the baryon number is well estimated through the charge transport mechanism @xcite .",
    "the mediators on which our study is focused are charginos , which consist of the fermionic partners of the charged su(2 ) gauge bosons and higgs bosons and have a mass matrix with a physical complex phase . since these particles couple to the higgs bosons by the su(2 )",
    "gauge interaction , their scatterings at the wall are not so weak as the leptons , while their asymmetries in the symmetric phase are maintained longer than the quarks",
    ". it will be shown that the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be explained in the ssm within the reasonable values for its model parameters .",
    "however , the allowed range for the new cp - violating phase is not so wide as estimated before @xcite , so that the baryogenesis could give nontrivial constraints on the ssm .",
    "although the baryogenesis within the wall might also be possible in the ssm @xcite , it has been generally shown that an enough amount of baryon asymmetry can not be produced within the wall only @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly review the source of cp violation in the chargino sector . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we discuss cp asymmetries in the reflection and transmission rates for the charginos at the bubble wall .",
    "the procedure for computing these rates , which gives accurate results , is presented explicitly . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we calculate the ratio of baryon number to entropy following the charge transport mechanism .",
    "the dependences of the ratio on various parameters are also analyzed .",
    "summary is given in sec .",
    "a new source of cp violation in the ssm comes from the mass matrices of the su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "the mass terms for the charged gauginos @xmath1 and higgsinos @xmath2 , @xmath3 are given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the mass parameter for the su(2 ) gauginos arising from the supersymmetry soft - breaking term ; @xmath6 denotes the mass parameter for the higgsinos from the bilinear term of higgs superfields in superpotential ; and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the vacuum expectation values of the higgs bosons with u(1 ) hypercharges @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the mass matrix ( [ 2 ] ) is diagonalized by unitary matrices @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath13 giving the mass eigenstates for the charginos @xmath14 .",
    "in general , the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 in the mass matrix ( [ 2 ] ) have complex values .",
    "although there is some freedom of defining phases for the particle fields , if the su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and thus @xmath7 and @xmath8 have non - vanishing values , all the complex phases can not be rotated away .",
    "the redefinitions of the fields make it possible without loss of generality to take @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 for real and positive",
    ". then @xmath6 can not be made real .",
    "therefore , there is one physical complex phase in the mass matrix for the charginos , which we express as @xmath15 owing to this complex phase , cp invariance is broken in the interactions for the charginos .",
    "similarly the mass matrix for the neutral gauginos and higgsinos contains the cp - violating phase .",
    "at the electroweak phase transition of the universe , if it is first order , bubbles of the broken phase nucleate in the su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) symmetric phase . in the symmetric phase the gauginos and the higgsinos are in mass eigenstates themselves . on the other hand , they are mixed to form mass eigenstates in the wall and in the broken phase , owing to non - vanishing vacuum expectation values of the higgs bosons .",
    "consequently , the gauginos incident on the wall from the symmetric phase can be reflected to become higgsinos , and vice versa .",
    "the charginos from the broken phase can be transmitted to the symmetric phase and become gauginos or higgsinos . in these processes",
    "cp violation makes a difference in reflection or transmission probability between a particle state with a definite helicity and its cp - conjugate state .",
    "the induced cp asymmetries shift equilibrium conditions in the symmetric phase for non - vanishing baryon number .",
    "the reflection and transmission rates at the wall are obtained by solving the dirac equations for the charginos . in the rest frame of the wall",
    "the dirac equations are given by @xmath16 @xmath17 where the wall is taken to be parallel to the @xmath18-plane and perpendicular to the velocity of the particles .",
    "the components of the dirac fields are expressed as @xmath19 we have adopted the chiral representation for the dirac @xmath20 matrices . in the symmetric phase the vacuum expectation values @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath8 vanish , while in the broken phase they are related to the @xmath21-boson mass as @xmath22 .",
    "the vacuum expectation values vary along the @xmath23-axis in the wall . for simplicity , we assume that the wall is situated from @xmath24 to @xmath25 and the @xmath23-dependences of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given by @xmath26 where the ratio @xmath27 is taken to be constant and equal to its value @xmath28 in the broken phase .",
    "the symmetric phase is in the region @xmath29 .    as a prototype for the calculation of the reflection and transmission rates",
    ", we consider the case that a gaugino with a positive helicity and energy @xmath30 enters from the symmetric phase .",
    "then the reflected particle ( gaugino , higgsino ) has a negative helicity and the transmitted particle ( charginos ) has a positive helicity by angular momentum conservation .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath24 becomes @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for the absolute values of the momenta for the gaugino and the higgsino .",
    "the incident gaugino , the reflected gaugino , and the reflected higgsino correspond to @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath25 becomes @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for the absolute values of the momenta for the two charginos .",
    "the lighter and heavier charginos correspond to @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . for the wave functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 given at @xmath24 , those at @xmath25 are obtained by numerically solving the differential equation ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the reflection and transmission amplitudes @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 then satisfy the simultaneous equation @xmath48 which is solved algebraically .",
    "the reliability of these numerical calculations may be checked by the sum @xmath49 , which is in excellent agreement with unity in our results .",
    "we calculate the asymmetries of the transition rates between cp conjugate processes @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the gaugino and the higgsino in the symmetric phase , respectively , and @xmath14 the chargino in the broken phase .",
    "the subscripts @xmath53 and @xmath54 refer to a positive and a negative helicities , respectively .",
    "if cp is not violated , @xmath55 and @xmath56 vanish . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the absolute values of these cp asymmetries are shown for ( a ) @xmath55 , ( b ) @xmath57 , and ( c ) @xmath58 as functions of the particle energy @xmath30 , taking @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 gev , and @xmath62 ( gev)@xmath63 . the sign of @xmath55 is negative for @xmath64 and positive for @xmath65 , and those of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are positive and negative , respectively .",
    "the sum of @xmath55 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 vanishes by cpt invariance .",
    "the cp asymmetry @xmath55 has values of order of 0.1 for the energy range in slightly excess of the particle mass and has much smaller values in the other energy range . since the mass of the lighter chargino becomes smaller than that of the gaugino , the gaugino is transmitted to the broken phase at a large rate .",
    "this makes the magnitude of @xmath55 rather small in spite of an unsuppressed value for the cp - violating phase .",
    "the cp asymmetries of the reflection and transmission rates for the charginos lead to a bias on equilibrium conditions favoring baryon asymmetry in the symmetric phase .",
    "the free energy is then minimized at a non - vanishing baryon number , to which the initial equilibrium state with no baryon asymmetry approaches through electroweak anomaly . a simple procedure for relating the cp asymmetries with the bias @xcite is to introduce chemical potentials for conserved and approximately conserved quantum numbers and set these quantum numbers for zero .",
    "this makes the chemical potential of baryon number given by a hypercharge density , which is induced by the cp asymmetries .",
    "although this procedure may not be completely correct , it would be able to provide a rough estimate for the bias .",
    "since the hypercharges of the gauginos and the higgsinos are @xmath66 and @xmath9 , respectively , the bubble wall emits a net flux of hypercharge by cp violation .",
    "the transitions which cause a change of hypercharge in the symmetric phase are ( i ) @xmath67 , ( ii ) @xmath68 , @xmath69 , ( iii ) @xmath70 , and their cp - conjugate transitions .",
    "the sum of the probabilities for the transitions in the reaction ( ii ) is however the same as that for their cp conjugate transitions by cpt invariance , so that a net hypercharge flux can be induced through the reactions ( i ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the hypercharge flux is calculated by convoluting the transition rates with the thermal flux of incoming particles . in the thermal frame at temperature @xmath71 , the incoming flux from the symmetric phase and that from the broken phase , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , are given by @xmath74^{-1 }              \\quad   ( d_s :   \\frac{p_z}{e_t}+v_w>0 ) ,        \\nonumber \\\\ f_b&=&-\\int\\int\\int_{d_b}\\frac{d^3{\\bf p}}{(2\\pi)^3 }                     ( \\frac{p_z}{e_t}+v_w)[\\exp(\\frac{e_t}{t}+1)]^{-1 }              \\quad   ( d_b :   \\frac{p_z}{e_t}+v_w<0 ) ,    \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent the total energy and the @xmath23-component of the momentum for the particle .",
    "the wall is taken to be perpendicular to the @xmath23-axis and moving with the velocity @xmath77 .",

    "is given by @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the rate per unit time and unit volume for the transition between the neighboring states different by unity in baryon number , and @xmath85 stands for the chemical potential of baryon number which represents a bias on the fluctuation of baryon number .",
    "in the symmetric phase the rate @xmath84 is estimated as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is of order of unity @xcite .",

    "the squarks , sleptons , and gluinos are assumed to be heavy enough . before the net hypercharge flux is emitted from the wall ,",
    "the baryon number and the lepton number vanish .",
    "we thus impose for equilibrium conditions vanishing values on the baryon and the lepton number densities in each generation , and on the number densities of the right - handed quarks and leptons except the @xmath88-quark . these constraints lead to the chemical potential for baryon number given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 stands for the hypercharge density .",
    "the net hypercharge flux into the symmetric phase induces a net hypercharge density , which makes @xmath85 non - vanishing .",

    "we studied the electroweak baryogenesis mediated by the charginos in the ssm following the charge transport mechanism .",
    "the observed baryon asymmetry is explained in reasonable ranges of the ssm parameters .",
    "however , the cp - violating phase can not be so small as estimated in the literature .",
    "this is mainly because the gauginos or the higgsinos incident on the wall from the symmetric phase can be transmitted to the broken phase , thus reducing the overall reflection rates in the wide region of the parameter space . assuming a moderate value for the transport time",
    ", the phase should be at least of order of @xmath120 .",
    "if this is the case , the squark masses are predicted to be around or larger than 1 tev from the analysis of the edm of the neutron .",
    "the ssm has some ambiguities in the higgs sector .",
    "the minimal version of the ssm contains two higgs doublets and no singlet .",
    "however , having a singlet field may well be motivated from various standpoints in particle physics , which could make the electroweak phase transition strongly first order .",
    "it should be noted that the chargino sector relevant to our discussions does not depend much on whether the ssm has a singlet or not , so that our analyses are mostly applicable to both cases .",
    "the baryon asymmetry could also be generated by the neutralinos which consist of neutral su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) gauginos and higgsinos .",
