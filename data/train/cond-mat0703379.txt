    "the entanglement properties of quantum chains in their ground state are by now rather well known .",
    "the most common measure is the entanglement entropy calculated with the reduced density matrix for a subsystem , usually a segment of the chain .",
    "this quantity was first studied within field theory @xcite and more recently also for various lattice models @xcite . for non - critical systems it is finite and of order one , but for critical systems it diverges logarithmically with the length of the subsystem .",
    "moreover , the prefactor of the logarithm is given by the central charge @xmath0 in the conformal classification , see @xcite . in systems with defects or disorder it",
    "may be modified @xcite .",
    "a more complex situation arises if the quantum state evolves in time .",
    "the simplest way to achieve this is a quench , where one changes a parameter of the system instantaneously .",
    "an eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian then becomes a superposition of the eigenstates of the final one and a complicated dynamics results .",
    "the concomitant evolution of the entanglement entropy has been the topic of several recent studies @xcite .",
    "if one is dealing with critical models , this can be discussed within conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "so far , most quenches considered were global , i.e. the system was modified everywhere in the same way .",
    "such a quench can actually be realized for atoms in optical lattices @xcite . in the theoretical studies",
    ", it was found that the entanglement entropy first increases linearly in time and then saturates at a value proportional to the size of the subsystem .",
    "thus it becomes an extensive quantity , in contrast to the equilibrium case .",
    "these features can be understood in a simple picture where pairs of particles transmit the entanglement from the initial state to later times @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study a different situation , namely a local quench .",
    "we consider free electrons hopping on a chain which initially contains a defect in form of a weakened bond .",
    "this defect is suddenly removed and the electronic system has to readjust . the set - up is similar to the x - ray absorption problem in metals where the creation of a deep hole leads to a local scattering potential . when a conduction electron fills the hole , this potential is switched off again @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a related study of the transverse ising model @xcite , we start from the ground state .",
    "we consider a section of the chain containing the defect in the interior or at its boundary and calculate the time evolution of its entanglement entropy with the rest .",
    "for the equilibrium case , this problem has been studied before @xcite .",
    "we find a time dependence which is very different from that for a global quench .",
    "the entanglement entropy only changes after a certain waiting time , increases then to a maximum or plateau , depending on the location of the defect , and finally decreases very slowly and in a universal way towards its equilibrium value . in particular , it remains always non - extensive .",
    "the calculations are numerical and based on the determination of the reduced density matrix @xmath1 from the one - particle correlation functions .",
    "the necessary formulae are given in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the case of a central defect , typical single - particle eigenvalue spectra and the long - time behaviour of s are discussed in section [ sec : center ] .",
    "the evolution of the entropy at intermediate times and for various defect positions is presented in section [ sec : defpos ] .",
    "the case of a boundary defect is studied in section [ sec : boundary ] and described by simple formulae based on fronts moving through the system . in section [ sec : summary ]",
    "we sum up our findings . in the two appendices we discuss the initial entanglement and present a simple example of a global quench for comparison .",
    "we consider a system of free spinless fermions hopping between neighbouring sites of an infinite chain ( xx model ) .",
    "the system is half filled and initially prepared in the ground state of the inhomogeneous hamiltonian @xmath2 where the hopping amplitudes are @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "thus one has a single bond defect between sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 . at time @xmath8",
    "this defect is removed and the time evolution is governed by the homogeneous hamiltonian @xmath9    both @xmath10 and @xmath11 describe critical systems . our aim is to study how the entanglement between a subsystem of length @xmath12 and the rest of the chain evolves after the quench .",
    "the subsystem is chosen in such a way that the initial defect is inside of it or at its boundary .",
    "the entanglement properties are determined by the reduced density matrix which for free fermions has the following diagonal form @xcite : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a normalization constant ensuring @xmath15 and the fermionic operators @xmath16 follow from the @xmath17 by an orthogonal transformation .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the eigenvalues of the time - dependent ( @xmath21 ) correlation matrix @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the ground state of @xmath10 and the indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 run over the sites of the subsystem .",
    "the @xmath20 also determine the entanglement entropy @xmath26 via @xmath27    to obtain the matrix @xmath28 one diagonalizes the operator @xmath11 by a fourier transform @xmath29 the time dependence of the @xmath30 then is @xmath31 and fourier transforming back gives , for a ring of @xmath32 sites , @xmath33 in the thermodynamic limit , the matrix elements @xmath34 of the unitary evolution operator can be written as bessel functions and the correlation matrix becomes @xmath35 this expresses @xmath28 in terms of the matrix @xmath36 calculated with the initial state @xmath23 .",
    "the information is transmitted via the bessel functions which have a maximum when the spatial separation is equal to the elapsed time .",
    "the factors in front of the bessel functions can lead to imaginary correlations and thus to local currents in the system .",
    "this is what one also expects on physical grounds .",
    "the initial matrix elements @xmath37 were already obtained in @xcite for the region to the right of the defect",
    ". then they have the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the correlation matrix of the homogeneous system @xmath40}{\\pi ( m - n)}\\ ] ] and @xmath41 is the contribution of the defect , given explicitly in eq .",
    "( 8) of @xcite .",
    "it depends only on @xmath42 and vanishes for @xmath43 .",
    "if the defect cuts the chain , @xmath44 reduces to @xmath45 with argument @xmath42 .",
    "when both sites are to the left of the defect , one simply has to replace @xmath42 with @xmath46 , and by a straightforward generalization one can obtain corresponding formulae for @xmath47 and @xmath48 on opposite sides of the defect .    with these initial values ,",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath28 was calculated numerically and then diagonalized to obtain the eigenvalue spectrum and the entanglement entropy .",
    "since the bessel functions decay rapidly for indices much larger than the argument @xmath49 , one can confine each of the sums in ( [ corellt ] ) to about @xmath50 terms .",
    "most calculations were done for times of the order 100 - 200 .",
    "we start with analyzing a simple symmetric situation , namely a defect with @xmath51 in the center of the subsystem .",
    "thus one starts with two uncoupled infinite half - chains which then are connected .    in figure",
    "[ fig : epsilon_t ] the time evolution of the single - particle spectrum is shown in two different ways .",
    "on the left hand side , the eight lowest eigenvalues @xmath18 are plotted in ascending order for several times .",
    "only the positive ones are shown , since due to the half - filling the spectrum is symmetric with respect to zero .",
    "these snapshots show that the initial step structure resulting from the degeneracies of the uncoupled chains smoothens with time and the dispersion curve seems to approach the one of the homogeneous system",
    ". however , two steps remain and as a consequence the curves lie below the asymptotic one . roughly speaking",
    ", this corresponds to a stronger entanglement .     for a subsystem of @xmath52 sites with a central defect @xmath51 .",
    "left : snapshots of the positive eigenvalues for different times , compared with the spectrum in equilibrium .",
    "right : time evolution of the four lowest eigenvalues.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for a subsystem of @xmath52 sites with a central defect @xmath51 . left : snapshots of the positive eigenvalues for different times , compared with the spectrum in equilibrium .",
    "right : time evolution of the four lowest eigenvalues.,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the right , the time evolution of the four lowest eigenvalues is displayed .",
    "it shows two important features .",
    "firstly , the eigenvalues remain unchanged and the two - fold degeneracy survives up to a time @xmath53 . this can be explained in terms of a front propagating with velocity @xmath54 @xcite which is the fermi velocity in the system and also the speed of the maxima in the bessel functions . before the front , starting at the defect , reaches the boundary , the subsystem to the right ( left ) of the defect can not become entangled with the environment to the left ( right ) .    secondly , for @xmath55 three of the eigenvalues quickly relax towards the values @xmath56 of the homogeneous system but one , on the contrary , starts to evolve rather slowly .",
    "these `` anomalous '' eigenvalues ( another one is found among the higher levels ) lead to the kinks in the dispersion curves on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : epsilon_t ] when they are close to another level .",
    "the smallest one is the most important for the entanglement , and its time dependence will determine that of @xmath57 , since the other @xmath18 are basically constant .    therefore it is important to have a general picture of its behaviour .",
    "figure [ fig : avoidcross ] shows what happens for times @xmath49 up to 1600 .",
    "in contrast to figure [ fig : epsilon_t ] , where the anomalous eigenvalue simply crossed over , one sees an avoided crossing with the next one , @xmath58 , which already looked relaxed at smaller times .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the two eigenstates in this case have the same reflection symmetry .     and",
    "@xmath59 already seen in figure [ fig : epsilon_t ] .",
    "the avoided level crossing can be fitted by @xmath60 with @xmath61 . ]    at the avoided crossing , the two eigenvalues exchange role and the anomalous parts of the curves can be well described by a single logarithm of the form @xmath60 , as shown in the figure .",
    "therefore the spectrum roughly looks as in equilibrium with at least one additional eigenvalue @xmath62 .",
    "one expects that for very large times @xmath62 finally converges to the maximal eigenvalue of the homogeneous system .",
    "therefore the logarithmic behaviour can not persist indefinitely .",
    "this could be confirmed for a rather small subsystem with @xmath63 sites , but for larger @xmath12 the necessary times are numerically inaccessible .",
    "moreover , the @xmath64 can only be calculated reliably for values up to about 25 .",
    "one can also look at the single - particle eigenfunctions connected with the @xmath64 .",
    "then one finds that they develop imaginary parts which vanish again as the eigenvalue approaches the equilibrium limit . in the anomalous eigenvector",
    "they persist more and generally speaking this eigenvector looks more extended than the others when @xmath62 is not close to a crossing .",
    "the entanglement entropy , finally , is shown in figure [ fig : entropyevol ] .",
    "the basic features are consequences of eigenvalue spectrum discussed above .",
    "one has a sudden jump at @xmath65 , followed by a very slow relaxation towards @xmath66 , the value in the homogeneous system .",
    "for a large subsystem , initial and final value of @xmath57 are also the same , as discussed in appendix a.     sites with a central defect @xmath51 .",
    "a sudden jump is followed by a slow relaxation towards the homogeneous value @xmath66 .",
    "the inset shows the logarithmic correction to the @xmath67 decay . ]",
    "as mentioned above , the slow decay can be understood in terms of the anomalous eigenvalue @xmath62 .",
    "its observed logarithmic time dependence implies @xmath68 .",
    "this yields for the entropy @xmath69 the inset in figure [ fig : entropyevol ] shows that the logarithmic corrections to the @xmath67 time dependence can be indeed observed and fitted very well .",
    "the height of the maximum in @xmath57 depends on the size of the subsystem and one finds the behaviour @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "all these results were obtained for a defect with @xmath73 .",
    "however , they also hold for the general case @xmath74 . then the spectra and the entropy have similar behaviour only the amplitude @xmath75 and the constant @xmath76 decrease with increasing @xmath77 , since the effect must vanish for @xmath43 .",
    "we now ask how the picture changes if one varies the position of the defect . for simplicity",
    "we discuss the case @xmath51 , in which the defect cuts the subsystem into two parts with @xmath78 sites to the left and @xmath79 to the right of it .",
    "figure [ fig : asymmblock ] shows the entropy for intermediate times and several defect positions , specified by the numbers @xmath78 and @xmath80 .",
    "the extreme cases are a defect at the boundary , @xmath81 , and in the center @xmath82 , as in the previous section .",
    "the main feature is the development of a plateau - like region , which can be understood in terms of fronts propagating from the defect site .",
    "the entropy increases rapidly at @xmath83 when one of the fronts reaches the closest boundary and starts to decay at @xmath84 when both fronts have left the subsystem .",
    "thus the plateau is related to the asymmetry of the set - up .",
    "sites for several defect positions @xmath85 , indicating the number of sites to the left / right of the defect with @xmath51 . ]",
    "one also finds that at time @xmath86 where the plateau region ends , the entropy always has the same value which moreover coincides with the maximum value ( [ eq : smax ] ) found for the central defect in the previous section . beyond this point ,",
    "the long - time region begins and shows the same relaxation behaviour as in ( [ eq : entdecay ] ) for all defect positions , although the curves do not coincide completely when shifted appropriately .",
    "the plateau itself will be studied in more detail in the following section .",
    "to obtain a better understanding of the development of the entropy plateau we now investigate the situation when it is most pronounced .",
    "this is the case for a defect located at the boundary of the subsystem .",
    "the behaviour for these intermediate times should be connected with the propagation of a wavefront in the subsystem .",
    "that such a front actually exists , can be seen from the single - particle eigenfunctions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eigvec ] we show snapshots of the lowest eigenvector for several intermediate times in a subsystem of @xmath87 sites .",
    "one can clearly recognize the front , either from the real part or from the imaginary part of the eigenvector .",
    "the latter , in particular , only develops behind the front , while it is approximately zero otherwise .",
    "sites and with a defect @xmath51 at the left boundary.,title=\"fig : \" ]   sites and with a defect @xmath51 at the left boundary.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   sites and with a defect @xmath51 at the left boundary.,title=\"fig : \" ]   sites and with a defect @xmath51 at the left boundary.,title=\"fig : \" ]    furthermore , the form of the eigenvectors suggests to interpret the front as an effective defect with a time - dependent position , which divides the subsystem in two parts of size @xmath49 and @xmath88 .",
    "this leads to an analogy with the equilibrium problem where the defect is located inside a subsystem .",
    "some details for this situation , which was not covered in @xcite are given in appendix a. in that case , the entropy can be written as a sum of logarithmic terms , which can be combined into a scaling function depending only on @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the location of the defect .",
    "starting from these equilibrium formulae , one is lead to make the following generalized ansatz for the nonequilibrium case @xmath92 where each of the coefficients depends on the strength of the defect .",
    "note , that one has to have @xmath93 in order to account for the nonsymmetric plateaus .",
    "the arguments of the logarithms have been shifted to avoid divergences in the interval @xmath94 $ ] .    in the simplest case of zero defect strength",
    "one can also motivate the ansatz ( [ fitplateau ] ) with the help of a simple physical picture .",
    "initially one has a subsystem which is entangled only with one of the half - chains and corresponding entropy @xmath95 .",
    "the propagating front carries information about the other half - chain , and therefore the @xmath49 sites of the subsystem which have already been visited by the front acquire an entropy @xmath96 , while the other @xmath88 sites still remain entangled only with one half - chain .",
    "this gives the values @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the constants .",
    "figure [ fig : plateau ] shows the entropy plateau curves with @xmath51 for different system sizes , together with the fit functions ( [ fitplateau ] ) .",
    "our fit gave the values @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we emphasize , that these coefficients have been obtained via a single fit to the @xmath102 data , and the other two curves differ only in the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "one can see a good agreement with the data , except for the boundaries of the time intervals .",
    "indeed , for @xmath103 the fit formula ( [ fitplateau ] ) scales as @xmath104 , that is the asymptotics of the equilibrium entropy @xmath105 .",
    "however , as it was mentioned in the previous section , the value @xmath106 is described by ( [ eq : smax ] ) , and for later times one enters in the regime of slow relaxation towards @xmath105 .",
    "boundary defect for different subsystem sizes .",
    "the fitting function is defined in eq .",
    "( [ fitplateau ] ) and the coefficients were determined by a single fit to the @xmath102 data . ]    the situation becomes slightly more complicated for arbitrary defect strengths in the range @xmath107 .",
    "considering the limiting case @xmath108 one has no time dependence at all , thus @xmath109 , however the entropy in this homogeneous case must scale as @xmath110",
    ". therefore the constant in ( [ fitplateau ] ) must be rewritten to contain a term proportional to @xmath111 with a new coefficient .",
    "finally , one could change to the scaling variables @xmath112 and write the entropy in the form @xmath113 where all the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 are functions of the defect strength and have to be determined by fitting to the data .",
    "note , that the above form of the entropy is expected to hold only for large @xmath12 and away from the boundaries of the time interval .",
    "in fact , we have always used the regularised ansatz ( [ fitplateau ] ) to determine the @xmath77-dependence of @xmath116 and @xmath117 by fitting to time series with @xmath87 fixed .",
    "then the additional logarithmic term was extracted from fitting to the @xmath117 values obtained from time series with different @xmath12 , @xmath77 being fixed .",
    "one finds after all , that @xmath118 , thus one needs only @xmath116 and @xmath115 to describe the plateaus .",
    "the @xmath77-dependence of the former two is depicted in figure [ fig : effc ] .",
    "one can see that the coefficients vary smoothly with @xmath77 , both of them going to zero as @xmath119 .     and",
    "@xmath120 as functions of the defect strength . ]    in conclusion , the time dependence of the entropy in the plateau - region can be written in the scaling form ( [ entscale ] ) for all values of the defect strength .",
    "the effective height of the plateau scales as @xmath121 with @xmath122 which indicates a logarithmic increase of the entropy for these intermediate times .",
    "we have studied a particular kind of quench , where the system remained critical and was only modified locally . starting from the ground state with a defect , we calculated the evolution of the reduced density matrix and the entanglement following from it .",
    "the main effect is an increase of the entropy @xmath57 on a time scale @xmath123 which can be related to the excitations near the fermi energy with velocity @xmath124 in our units .",
    "thus the entanglement always increases at the early stages of the rearrangement process .",
    "the criticality of the system is reflected in the logarithmic dependence of various quantities , in particular the height of the maximum of @xmath57 , on the size of the subsystem .",
    "for the case of a boundary defect , where the mechanism at work leads to a plateau , we could also find the scaling function describing its shape .",
    "the defect strength only changes the parameters , which are closely related to those in equilibrium , but not the qualitative features .",
    "the long - time behaviour is characterized by a slow approach to the homogeneous ground state . for the times",
    "accessible , one finds a universal law independent of the defect strength .",
    "thus no anomalous exponents as in the x - ray problem enter .",
    "these appear for time - delayed correlation functions or in the overlap between initial and time - dependent state , whereas here one is following the evolving state directly .",
    "a particular feature of our situation is that the initial state is asymptotically degenerate with the final ground state .",
    "this distinguishes it from the case of global quenches , where the energy difference between both is extensive , and also from the study in @xcite , where the evolution started from a randomly chosen high - energy state and the main interest was in the thermalization . on the level of the reduced density matrix",
    ", one can define an effective temperature , if @xmath1 has thermal form , which is always the case for free fermions , and if the @xmath125 , or at least the important ones , are proportional to the single - particle excitations of the hamiltonian .",
    "this is the case for critical systems where both have linear dispersion @xcite and also for the global quench considered in appendix b. in this sense , our subsystem thermalizes with an effective temperature @xmath126 which vanishes if one considers the whole system , while the quench in appendix b leads to a finite value @xmath127 .",
    "altogether we have obtained a good overall picture of the phenomena , although some aspects like the oscillations in @xmath57 and the influence of the filling have not been addressed .",
    "however , an analytical derivation of the asymptotic time dependence would still be desirable .",
    "we would like to thank m. cramer , j. eisert , e. jeckelmann , c. kollath , a. luchli and k.d .",
    "schotte for discussions .",
    "for a defect at the boundary of the subsystem , the entanglement entropy has already been studied in @xcite . for a general location , an expression can be given immediately if @xmath51 .",
    "then one has two half - chains where segments at the ends are part of the subsystem .",
    "if their respective lengths @xmath25 and @xmath128 are large , the conformal formulae @xcite lead to @xmath129 + 2 k_1 \\label{eqn : defect1}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the hopping model .",
    "thus @xmath57 is maximal when the defect is in the center of the subsystem , @xmath132 .",
    "numerical calculations show that this law also holds for arbitrary defect strengths @xmath133 but with a constant @xmath134 depending on @xmath77 .",
    "measuring the position of the defect from the center of the subsystem , @xmath135 , one can write it in the form @xmath136 + \\frac { c'}{3 } \\ln \\,\\bigl[\\,1 -   ( \\frac { 2x}{l})^2\\ ; \\bigr ] ,   \\label{eqn : defect2}\\ ] ] the term in the bracket with @xmath137 represents the entropy of the homogeneous system which is reduced by the scaling function , except for a central defect .",
    "the coefficient @xmath134 is related to the quantity @xmath138 which appears for a boundary defect @xcite via @xmath139 . if the defect is outside the subsystem , the same formula holds with @xmath140 replaced by @xmath141",
    ". then @xmath57 is unaffected , if the defect is far away from the subsystem , as one expects .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : ent_defectpos ] for the case @xmath142 and served as a guidance for the analysis of the non - equilibrium results in section [ sec : boundary ] .     with a defect of @xmath142 as a function of the defect position @xmath91 measured from the center of the subsystem . ]",
    "it is instructive to compare local and global quenches at the level of the density - matrix spectra .",
    "a simple global quench in the hopping model is obtained if one starts with a fully dimerized chain in its ground state which is then made homogeneous .",
    "thus initially @xmath143 and @xmath144 and only pairs of sites are coupled . for half filling ,",
    "this leads to a correlation matrix @xmath36 which consists of ( @xmath145 ) blocks along the diagonal with all elements equal to one - half .",
    "explicitly , @xmath146 \\label{eqn : global1}\\ ] ] due to the translational invariance ( up to the alternating factors ) this leads to the simple result @xmath147   \\label{eqn : global2}\\ ] ] which involves only single bessel functions .",
    "the resulting @xmath125 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : globalquench ] for @xmath87 and several times .",
    "sites in case of a global quench starting with a fully dimerized initial state . ]",
    "one sees that the dispersion is linear near zero with a slope which decreases in time .",
    "this makes the number of low - lying levels larger and is responsible for the initial increase of the entanglement entropy . for times exceeding @xmath148 ,",
    "however , an asymptotic curve is approached and @xmath57 saturates .",
    "the asymptotic form of the @xmath125 follows from the first two terms in ( [ eqn : global2 ] ) which describe a homogeneous tridiagonal matrix with eigenvalues @xmath149 where the @xmath150 are the allowed momenta for an open chain .",
    "this gives @xmath151 the spacing of the @xmath150 proportional to @xmath152 then leads to an asymptotic value @xmath153 if one converts the sums for @xmath57 into integrals .",
    "the explicit result is @xmath154 and was found also in @xcite for a similar quench in the transverse ising model .",
    "these results illustrate the strong influence of a global quench on the form of the spectrum and the level spacing . for a local quench ,",
