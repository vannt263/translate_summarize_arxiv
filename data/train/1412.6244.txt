    "forecasting volatility opens up a possibility to make better - informed decisions .",
    "thus this problem is of high interest to the practitioners in business and economic policy making as well as to the scientific community .",
    "the auto - regressive conditionally heteroskedastic ( arch ) model and its generalization , known as garch , were proposed exactly for this purpose @xcite . since then",
    "numerous modifications of the seminal models proposed by engle and bollerslev were introduced to serve varying purposes : from financial market to macroeconomic modeling ( see @xcite for a long list of the arch family models ) .",
    "our particular interest , in the context of this paper , lies in the continuous - time garch model ( cogarch , see @xcite ) and nonlinear variations of garch , such as ngarch @xcite or march @xcite .    in order to evaluate the suitability of a given model one",
    "should compare the features of the time series produced by the model with the actual empirical data .",
    "it is known that high frequency time series of financial data exhibit some universal statistical properties .",
    "vast amounts of historical stock price data around the world have helped to establish a variety of so - called stylized facts @xcite corresponding to the statistical signatures of financial processes .",
    "one of the stylized facts concerns with autocorrelation function , or , equivalently , power spectral density ( psd ) of the time series .",
    "there is empirical evidence that trading activity , trading volume , and volatility are stochastic variables with the long - range correlation @xcite leading to @xmath1 type psd .",
    "successful models should reproduce as many stylized facts as possible .",
    "however , the @xmath1 type psd is not accounted for in some widely used models , such as arch family models .",
    "therefore , it would be useful to examine under which conditions power law psd may be observed in garch(1,1 ) and in nonlinear modifications of garch(1,1 ) models .",
    "power law statistics and especially @xmath1 noise are rather ubiquitous phenomena observed in many different fields of science ranging from natural phenomena to computer networks and financial markets @xcite . since the discovery of @xmath1 noise numerous models and theories have been proposed , for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "a class of nonlinear stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) exhibiting power law probability density function ( pdf ) and power law psd in a wide region of frequencies has been derived in @xcite starting from the point process model .",
    "such nonlinear sdes have been used to describe signals in socio - economical systems @xcite .",
    "usually arch family models are calibrated by retro - fitting historical data and thus may replicate patterns observed in the past @xcite . yet",
    "other approaches are also possible .",
    "for example , one may consider comparing them to successful models from other frameworks . in this paper",
    "we compare garch(1,1 ) and its nonlinear modifications to nonlinear stochastic differential equations generating signals with power law psd .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : stochastic - differential - equation ] we briefly introduce a class of nonlinear sdes reproducing @xmath1 noise ; in section [ sec : garch(1,1 ) ] we show that power law distributions with varying exponents may be obtained from garch(1,1 ) process ; in section [ sec : ngarch ] we consider a nonlinear modifications of garch(1,1 ) process using which we reproduce @xmath1 noise .",
