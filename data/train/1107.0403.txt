    "production of dark matter and baryon number of the universe is very important in cosmology . in the gauge - mediated supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking , the gravitino is natural candidate of the dark matter , while the afflick - dine ( ad ) baryogenesis @xcite is promising mechanism because thermal leptogenesis confronts serious cosmological gravitino problem , for example .",
    "it is well known that the ad condensate transforms into nontopological solitons , @xmath0 balls , during the course of baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "the charge of the @xmath0 ball in the gauge mediation could be large enough to be stable against the decay into nucleons , and the @xmath0 ball itself could be the dark matter of the universe @xcite . in this case , however , nondetections in direct and/or indirect @xmath0-ball searches tell us that it may be difficult to simultaneously obtain enough baryon asymmetry of the universe .    on the other hand , the small charge @xmath0 ball will decay into nucleons . at the same time , it could decay into gravitinos , which would have enough abundance to be the dark matter .",
    "this idea was considered in refs.@xcite . in the former ,",
    "the authors considered relatively small charge @xmath0 balls which evaporate in the thermal bath , and imagined that the gravitino is directly produced from the @xmath0 balls . in this case",
    ", however , most of the charge decays ( evaporates ) at the temperature around the electroweak scale , and sparticles are created , finally leading to the production of the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) , which thermalizes immediately .",
    "the gravitino could be produced by the nlsp decay , but the abundance of the gravitino is too small to be the dark matter of the universe , and the nlsp decay would destroy light elements during the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .    in the latter reference , the formed @xmath0 ball is the gravity - mediation type , which is able to decay into nlsps nonthermally .",
    "the nlsp decays into the gravitiono in the end , but they did not discuss the fact that the nlsp abundance is limited severely by the bbn constraints for @xmath1 gev , so that the amount of the produced gravitino should be much smaller than that to be the dark matter @xcite .    in this article , we investigate a very simple scenario that the unstable @xmath0 balls decay mainly into nucleons , partially into gravitinos with small branching ratio , while kinematically forbidden to nlsps almost throughout the decay process , in the gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "the crucial observation reveals that the right amounts of the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe can be created through this process .",
    "the scenario is achieved by a couple of key ingredients .",
    "one is that the @xmath0 ball decays from its surface @xcite so that the decay rate through the main channel has an upper bound , which is called the saturated rate , while the decay into gravitino is not saturated .",
    "another is that a large enough @xmath0 ball forbids the decay into the nlsp , while allowing the decay into nucleons and gravitinos , having an appropriate lifetime to decay at the temperature of @xmath2(10 mev ) .",
    "the whole scenario proceeds as follows .",
    "the ad field starts the oscillation ( rotation ) after inflation .",
    "the rotation has an oblate orbit in the potential . due to the negative pressure ,",
    "the ad field feels spatial instabilities , which grow into @xmath0 and anti-@xmath0 balls .",
    "the @xmath0 and anti-@xmath0 balls decay into nucleons and anti - nucleons to create the baryon asymmetry in the universe , while producing small amount of gravitinos which become the dark matter of the universe .",
    "nlsps would be produced only at the very end of the decay process when the charge of the q ball becomes small enough to open the kinematically allowed channel to the nlsp production@xcite , and its abundance is small enough to evade any cosmological disasters such as spoiling the successful bbn .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the features of the @xmath0 ball in the gauge - mediated susy breaking model , and the details of the decay process of the @xmath0 ball are described in sec .",
    "[ qdecay ] . in sec.[abundances ] , we estimate the abundances of the baryon number , the dark matter , and the nlsp .",
    "we impose bbn constraints on the nlsp abundances to derive the allowed gravitino mass range in sec.[bbnconstraints ] . in sec.[scenario ]",
    ", we show the region in the model parameter space where the successful scenario exists .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the ad field consists of some combination of squarks and sleptons .",
    "the potential is flat in the susy - exact limit , but due to the breaking of susy in gauge mediation , it is lifted as@xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a soft breaking mass , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are related respectively to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 components of a gauge - singlet chiral multiplet @xmath9 in the messenger sector as @xmath10 here @xmath11 generically stands for the standard model gauge coupling , and @xmath5 is allowed in the following range : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gravitino mass and @xmath14 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the ad field starts the oscillation when @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the field amplitude at the onset of the oscillations .",
    "the field fluctuations grow exponentially due to the negative pressure during the helical motion , and the field transforms into @xmath0 balls .",
    "the charge of the formed @xmath0 ball is estimated as@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 for a circular orbit ( @xmath19 ) , while @xmath20 for an oblate case ( @xmath21 ) . here",
    "@xmath22 represents the ellipticity of the field orbit .",
    "the charge @xmath0 is just the @xmath23-numbers , and relates to the baryon number of the @xmath0 ball as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the value of the baryon number carried by a @xmath23 particle .",
    "for example , @xmath26 for the @xmath27 direction .",
    "the mass , the size , the rotation speed of the field , and the field value at the center of the @xmath0 ball are related to the charge @xmath0 as @xmath28 respectively .",
    "a @xmath0-ball decay takes place if some decay particles carry the same kind of the charge of the @xmath0 ball , and the mass of all the decay particle is less than @xmath29 . in this case , the @xmath0-ball decay rate @xmath30 has an upper bound , which we call the saturated rate @xmath31 @xcite : @xmath32 where we use eqs.([rq ] ) and ( [ omegaq ] ) in the last equality .",
    "the decay rate saturates typically when @xmath33 , where the elementary process has an interaction of @xmath34 . on the other hand , for @xmath35 , the decay rate",
    "is given by@xcite @xmath36 since we are interested in the case that the @xmath0 ball can decay into nucleons ( @xmath37 , where @xmath38 gev is the nucleon mass ) and , at the same time , the decay into nlsps is kinematically prohibited ( @xmath39 ) , the main decay channel is the decay into nucleons .",
    "we thus consider the @xmath0-ball charge in the range @xmath40 , where @xmath41 notice that the nlsp is produced at the latest moment of the decay , only after the charge of the @xmath0 ball becomes less than @xmath42 during the course of the decay@xcite .",
    "the elementary process of the main channel is squark @xmath43 squark @xmath44 quark @xmath43 quark via ( heavy ) gluino exchange , whose rate is estimated as@xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the gluino mass , and @xmath47 is a possible ckm suppression factor ( @xmath48 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we obtain the effective coupling as @xmath49 since we have @xmath50 the main decay channel is saturated so that we must use the saturated rate @xmath31 for the decay .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 ball decays when the cosmic time becomes the lifetime of the @xmath0 ball : @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath0 ball decays when the universe is radiation - dominated , and the cosmic temperature at the decay is estimated as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the degrees of freedom at the corresponding temperature , and set to be 10.75 here .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath0-ball decay into gravitinos is not saturated .",
    "the decay rate of the elementary process squark @xmath44 quark @xmath43 gravitino is given by @xmath54 since effective coupling is thus estimated as @xmath55 we have @xmath56 where we use eqs.([omegaq ] ) and ( [ phiq ] ) in the first equality , and eq.([mfrange ] ) in the second equality .",
    "therefore , the branching ratio of the decay into the gravitino is estimated as @xmath57",
    "the number densities of the baryon number , the gravitino dark matter , and the nlsp are respectively related to the number density of the ad field as @xmath58 wmap seven - year data tells us @xmath59@xcite . since the ratio of the gravitiono dark matter and the baryon densities is @xmath60 we must have @xmath61 therefore , the orbit of the ad field should be oblate , which is natural in the gauge - mediated susy breaking models . as mentioned above",
    ", this leads to the production of both @xmath0 and anti-@xmath0 balls to cancel out the baryon number to be small enough , compared to the gravitino dark matter .",
    "baryon number is created when the ad field starts the rotation .",
    "it can be estimated as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are used in the last equality in the second line , and @xmath65 from eq.([qosc ] ) is used in the last line . inserting eq.([epsilon ] ) , we obtain @xmath66 this provides the relation among @xmath0 , @xmath5 , and @xmath67 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the nlsp abundance is estimated as @xmath68 where @xmath69 , and we use @xmath70 in the second equality , and eqs.([n3/2 ] ) , ( [ nnlsp ] ) , ( [ qcr ] ) , and ( [ b3/2 ] ) in the third one .",
    "we can now consider the limits of the abundance from bbn constraints in the next section .",
    "the abundance of the nlsp is limited by bbn constraints , since the decay of the nlsp affects the abundances of light elements .",
    "it depends on the gravitino mass and the species of the nlsp how it has an influence on them .",
    "let us first estimate the expected abundance of the nlsp in the limiting case , which means that the @xmath0 ball decays just in time for bbn ( @xmath711 or 3 mev ) , and the thermally produced gravitinos do not overdominate .",
    "the latter condition is rephrased in terms of the constraint on the reheating temperature as@xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a gluino mass evaluated at @xmath74 . using eqs.([td ] ) and ( [ yb ] ) , we can eliminate @xmath5 and @xmath0 from eq.([ynlsp ] ) , which results in @xmath75 where eq.([trh ] ) is used in the last inequality . in fig.[fig_nlsp ] , it is shown in red lines , above which is allowed . also shown are the bbn constraints for bino ( blue ) , stau ( pink ) , and sneutrino ( green ) nlsps , where upper right regions are excluded  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we plot the dotted line as the nlsp abundance that the gravitinos produced by the nlsp decays has a right amount of dark matter : @xmath76    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     only the stau nlsp is allowed in the region shown in faint red in fig.[fig_qmf](a ) . in fig.[fig_qmf](b ) , there are three territories , where the faint ( @xmath77 mev ) and the dark ( @xmath78 mev ) red are applicable to the stau and the sneutrino nlsps , while the blue is for the bino nlsp . on the other hand ,",
    "all three species ( bino , stau , and sneutrino nlsps ) are relevant for the allowed region in fig.[fig_qmf](c ) , which corresponds to the nlsp abundance between the red lines [ eq.([ynlsp1 ] ) ] and the dotted line [ eq.([nlsp3/2 ] ) ] in fig.[fig_nlsp](a ) .",
    "we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig_qmf](d ) where @xmath79 mev that the allowed region disappear completely for @xmath80 mev , and only a tiny area remains for @xmath81 mev .",
    "thus , we obtain the lower bound of the gravitino mass that could result in successful scenario as @xmath82 gev for @xmath78 ( 1 ) mev .",
    "notice that the allowed regions reside in such parameter space that the @xmath0-ball charge is by far large enough so that the @xmath0 ball survives from the evaporation in thermal bath , where the @xmath0 ball evaporates if the charge is less than @xcite @xmath83 which is shown by green dashed lines in fig.[fig_qmf ] . on the other hand , black dotted lines in these figures denote the boundary above which the @xmath0 ball is the gauge - mediation type : @xmath84 also notice that those @xmath0 balls in the allowed region in fig .",
    "[ fig_qmf](a ) ( @xmath79 gev ) will form when the field starts rotation at the field amplitude larger than @xmath85 , where the gravity - mediation effects dominate over the gauge - mediation ones . depending on the one - loop potential",
    ", the formed @xmath0 ball could be the delayed type @xcite or the new type @xcite which later transforms into the gauge - mediation type , or the gauge - mediation type may form directly .",
    "we have investigated the scenario of simultaneous production of the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe through the @xmath0-ball decay in the gauge - mediated susy breaking model .",
    "this is simply achieved by the @xmath0 ball with charge small enough to decay into nucleons to create baryon number of the universe .",
    "we have calculated the branching ratio of the gravitino to find that it is small .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the observed baryon to dark matter abundance ratio , the ad field should rotate in the oblate orbit so that both @xmath0 and anti-@xmath0 balls are created to suppress the baryon number compared to the gravitino dark matter .    at the same time",
    ", the charge should be large enough to kinematically forbid the decay into nlsps .",
    "this evades the serious bbn constraints on the nlsp abundance , which was not properly taken into account in the literatures .",
    "nlsps are actually produced at the very end of the @xmath0-ball decay when the charge becomes small enough to open the corresponding decay channel .",
    "including all these considerations , we have used the bbn constraints for the bino , stau , and sneutrino nlsps in ref.@xcite , to get the allowed range of the gravitiono mass .",
    "we have found that typically @xmath86 gev for @xmath87 gev .",
    "we have also shown the allowed region in @xmath88 plane for @xmath89 gev .",
    "we thus have found the production of right amounts of both the baryon asymmetry and the gravitino dark matter of the universe is successful when the @xmath0 ball has the charge @xmath90 for @xmath91 gev and @xmath92 gev .",
    "it is naturally achieved , for example , for the @xmath93 @xmath27 direction . in this case , the nonrenormalizable superpotential @xmath94 determines the field amplitude at the onset of the oscillation @xmath95 , and also leads to the @xmath8-term of the form @xmath96 , and the scenario is successful for @xmath97 gev , @xmath98 gev , and @xmath99 , which leads to @xmath100 gev , and @xmath101 .",
