    "this talk summarizes our work on the higher - loop perturbative gluon and ghost propagators in landau gauge  @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo study of both propagators , which are closely related to each other by schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) , has attracted much attention outside the lattice community by phenomenologists working on infrared qcd in general and hadron physics ( see our original papers for further references ) . taken together , both propagators provide us with a definition and the momentum dependence of the running coupling @xmath2 directly based on the ghost - gluon vertex .",
    "a simple connection between the two propagators exists in the extreme infrared , both beeing powerlike in a scaling or massive in a decoupling solution .",
    "this nonuniqueness reflects the gribov problem .",
    "the effect of nontrivial vacuum structure ( vortices , instantons ) is manifest also in the gluon propagator , in the intermediate momentum range around @xmath3 where the sde approach suffers from truncation ambiguities and where nonperturbative lattice calculations are unrivalled . in order to follow the onset of nonperturbative effects ,",
    "it is desirable to approach this momentum range from high momenta within higher - order perturbation theory . while ordinary diagrammatic lattice perturbation theory ( lpt ) soon gets too involved to be pursued , numerical stochastic perturbation theory ( nspt , for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , provides a powerful tool to perform high - loop computations .",
    "nspt has its roots in stochastic quantization and is based on a modified langevin equation equipped with stochastic gauge fixing .",
    "we use here a version for quenched lattice qcd with wilson gauge action .",
    "actually , it is a hierarchy of first - order evolution equations associated with various parts of the gauge link fields @xmath4 and gluon fields @xmath5 exposed by an expansion in powers of the lattice coupling @xmath6 : @xmath7 these different orders are separately dealt within the code . the maximal addressable order of perturbation theory is thus limited by the available computing resources ( cpu time and memory ) .    the langevin simulation is implemented in an euler scheme with a finite evolution time step . before the estimator for the gauge",
    "dependent ghost and gluon propagators can be evaluated , we have to fix the gauge to the minimal landau gauge . for this purpose ,",
    "a sequence of configurations ( separated by @xmath8 langevin time steps ) is subjected to a fourier - accelerated gauge - fixing procedure , after which the individual gluon fields , @xmath9 ( associated with particular perturbative order @xmath10 ) are transversal within machine precision .",
    "the propagators are evaluated taking the long - time average of coefficients , order by order in a loop expansion in even powers of @xmath11 .",
    "contributions from odd powers vanish within the statistical errors . as for any langevin simulation ,",
    "one then has to take the limit to vanishing time step . in order to get results comparable with the practice of lpt , the continuum limit and the limit of infinite volume must be performed .",
    "nspt results for _ finite _ lattice volume and spacing can be confronted directly with standard mc results for a given @xmath12 , provided the definitions of the studied observables is the same .",
    "the gluon two - point function in @xmath13-loop order is defined as a convolution of the bilinears of gluon fields ( in momentum space ) in complementary orders ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 \\ ,    \\right\\rangle_u \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : dn}\\ ] ] in landau gauge we consider @xmath17 and use the dressing functions ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19    the color diagonal ghost propagator in momentum space is the color trace in the adjoint representation @xmath20 in ( [ eq : g - definition ] ) @xmath21 is the fourier transform of the inverse fp operator in lattice coordinate space . it is expanded in terms of products of various @xmath22 , with the term @xmath23 collecting all terms of order @xmath24 .",
    "this structure allows to express @xmath21 also as an expansion in orders of @xmath11 in a recursive way .",
    "again we use the ghost dressing functions @xmath25    as an example the cumulatively summed perturbative gluon dressing function for various volumes is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure15b ] using @xmath26 .",
    "a reasonable `` convergence '' of the nspt results up to few loops ( three or four are available now ) requires a small bare coupling @xmath11 .",
    "however , @xmath11 is known to be a poor expansion parameter  @xcite .",
    "one can speed up convergence by `` boosting '' , i.e. , trading the bare coupling constant by an effective `` boosted '' coupling @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 is defined by the average perturbative plaquette determined also within our langevin simulations .",
    "the effect of the boosted coupling being larger is overcompensated by the rapid decay of the expansion coefficients with increasing order @xmath13 .",
    "we illustrate the effect of `` boosting '' the perturbative expansion and confront the boosted dressing functions with corresponding new monte carlo ( mc ) data of the berlin group  @xcite adopting the same definitions for the propagators and the gauge fixing as in nspt .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure16a],[fig : figure16b ] where also the bare and the boosted inverse couplings @xmath12 and @xmath29 are given . as expected ,",
    "boosting moves the nspt data closer to the mc results , but they can not be reached completely , certainly not at @xmath30 .     lattice . ]     for the gluon dressing function in four loops . ]    here we define the renormalization - group invariant running coupling @xmath31 by the ghost - gluon vertex in a particular ( minimal ) mom scheme ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is given in terms of the bare gluon and ghost dressing functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 the @xmath31 calculated from the nspt dressing functions , both summed up to the orders available , is compared to the mc results at @xmath30 and @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding data is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : figure18a],[fig : figure18b ]     to corresponding mc data for a @xmath36 lattice at @xmath30 . ]     at @xmath30 zoomed into the large momentum region . ]    again for naive and boosted perturbation theory .",
    "we see that the running coupling from mc simulations is approached at large momenta from below up to 7% for @xmath30 and practically approached within the present errors for @xmath37 , i.e. in an effectively deconfined phase .",
    "in the ri-mom scheme the dressing functions are just the wave function renormalization constants for the ghost and gluon fields at the renormalization point @xmath40 .",
    "the nspt data available at various volumes and lattice momentum realizations allow us to find the perturbative dressing functions to three - loop accuracy in the bare coupling including the non - logarithmic contributions . via standard transformations",
    "the results can be transformed to the renormalized coupling in the preferred scheme . to find those constants ,",
    "a fitting procedure has been proposed which takes into account both hypercubic and finite volume effects ( for details see  @xcite ) . as result",
