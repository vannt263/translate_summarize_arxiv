    "the hvcs and ivcs consist of gas moving at velocities incompatible with a simple model of differential galactic rotation .",
    "wakker@xcite defines the `` deviation velocity '' ( v@xmath4 ) as the difference between the observed lsr velocity and the maximum velocity that can be understood in terms of galactic rotation . with this definition hvcs",
    "have @xmath5v@xmath6@xmath5@xmath7@xmath890 , while ivcs have @xmath5v@xmath6@xmath5=3090 .",
    "maps of the large - scale structure of hvcs@xcite in 21-cm  emission are based on four surveys .",
    "two of these@xcite , cover the sky on a 1@xmath11  grid ( 2@xmath12  for declinations",
    "@xmath9@xmath1018 ) , down to a column density of @xmath822 , though only at 16velocity resolution .",
    "the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( lds@xcite ) and its southern equivalent@xcite cover the sky on a 05@xmath105 grid , at 1  velocity resolution , but only down to about 82 .",
    "most of the recent progress in understanding the origin of the hvcs and ivcs has been made through measurements of distances and metallicities .",
    "wakker@xcite summarizes the available literature up to mid 2001 .",
    "below , a short summary is given of each of the origins for which observational evidence now exists .",
    "distance measurements exist for several ivcs : the iv - arch ( @xmath11=0.71.7 kpc ) , the lliv - arch ( z=0.9 kpc ) , complex  k ( @xmath11@xmath94.5 kpc ) and the pp - arch ( @xmath11@xmath90.9 kpc ) .",
    "all of these show metallicities of 0.51 times solar .",
    "fuse data of extra - galactic targets show  absorption at ivc velocities in many cases and in few of these , the  absorption appears to be centered at the same velocity as the  of the ivc . however , it is not always clear whether the  is associated with the ivc , or whether the galactic  component is just broad .",
    "for the two ivc sightlines have been studied in detail ( pg0804 + 761@xcite and pg1259 + 593@xcite ) the properties of the gas ( distance , metallicity , ionization structure , the presence of hot gas ) are compatible with the notion that the ivcs are a manifestation of the galactic fountain .",
    "the magellanic stream is comparatively well understood . for a while it seemed possible",
    "that the stream is the result of ram - pressure stripping@xcite , but since the identification of the leading arm@xcite the tidal model is clearly favored .",
    "two measurements of /  in the stream exist . toward ngc3783 , ( @xmath12,@xmath13)=(287,+23 ) ,",
    "lu et al.@xcite found a value of 0.25@xmath140.07 times solar , while toward fairall9 , ( @xmath12,@xmath13)=(295,@xmath1058 ) gibson et al.@xcite find 0.33@xmath140.05 times solar . in",
    "the most complete published model@xcite the combined tidal force of the lmc and galaxy on the smc peaked 2gyr ago , during their previous peri - galacticon passage . as a result about 2.58  of material ( out of an original total of 88@xcite ) was extracted from the outer parts of the smc .",
    "one orbit later the mcs are again near perigalacticon , now followed by a trailing tidal arm ( the magellanic stream , m=1.58 ) and a leading arm ( m=8 ) .",
    "figure 1 presents a map of the  in the magellanic system , in a coordinate system where galactic longitude @xmath12=270runs along the equator .",
    "complex  a is the only hvc with a known distance .",
    "a bracket of 410kpc was derived by van woerden et al.@xcite .",
    "a fuse spectrum of the star pg0832 + 675 improves this to 810kpc .",
    "this implies a gaseous mass of 26  ( including a correction for he and assuming a 20% ionized fraction ) .",
    "so far , its metallicity is unknown , but fuse spectra of two extra - galactic objects suggest a value @xmath90.2 times solar , although contamination by h@xmath15 lines is a major problem .",
    "the second largest hvc is complex  c. a map of its very complex velocity field is presented by wakker@xcite .",
    "its distance is still fairly uncertain , but probably between 5 and 20kpc , implying a total mass of 350 .",
    "its metallicity is comparatively well - known .",
    "initially , wakker et al.@xcite measured the sulphur abundance in the direction of mrk290 ( n ( ) = 92 ) as ( s / h)=0.09@xmath140.02@xmath140.02 times solar . here",
    "the first error is statistical and the second systematic , and this value takes into account h@xmath16 , s@xmath17 and  small - scale structure .",
    "sulphur is a good element to use in this game , as ( a ) it is mostly undepleted onto dust grains , ( b ) s@xmath16 is the dominant ionization stage in the diffuse ism and ( c ) the 1250 , 1253 and 1259 lines are neither too strong nor too weak .",
    "oxygen is also good , as it s ionization is strongly tied to that of hydrogen , although some oxygen may be depleted onto dust .",
    "richter et al.@xcite measured abundances in the spectrum of pg1259 + 593 ( n()= 92 ) and found : /=0.012@xmath140.005 , /=0.09@xmath18 , /=0.10@xmath19 , /hi=0.12@xmath20 , /=0.14@xmath140.04 and /=",
    "0.054@xmath21 times solar .",
    "on the other hand , gibson et al.@xcite found that /    = 0.33@xmath140.05 toward mrk817 ( n()=32 ) and /hi=0.039@xmath140.007 toward mrk876 ( n()= 122 ) . in the latter sightline , murphy et al .",
    "@xcite also found /= 0.48@xmath140.20 , although a large ionization correction is expected because n ( ) is low .",
    "yet , a factor 10 is difficult to reconcile with the non - detection of h@xmath22 emission .",
    "further , toward mrk290 a stis spectrum shows that in this sightline /=0.52@xmath140.04 , while the fuse spectrum of mrk817 gives /=0.19@xmath140.05 and /=0.19 times solar .",
    "these abundances shows several interesting patterns .",
    "\\(1 ) they clearly confirm the low metallicity of complex c found by wakker et al.@xcite .",
    "there is some evidence for variations in the metallicity across the cloud , considering the two different values found for /  and /.",
    "measurements in more directions will be necessary to understand this .",
    "\\(2 ) in both the pg1259 + 593 and the mrk817 sightline the /  ratio is @xmath81.5 times solar , suggesting either that  is somewhat depleted onto dust , or that a substantial fraction of the hydrogen is ionized .",
    "\\(3 ) two elements that are usually lightly depleted ( al and si ) seem to be undepleted in complex  c , as the ratios al/(o , s ) and si/(o , s ) are @xmath7 solar .",
    "this suggests that there is little or no dust present .",
    "\\(4 ) iron still appears depleted in three sightlines : /  lies in the range 0.40.6 times solar for mrk290 , mrk817 and pg1259 + 593 .",
    "this may mean that either there is some dust made exclusively of iron particles , or that the fe / s ratio in complex  c is intrinsically subsolar .",
    "\\(5 ) nitrogen is clearly underabundant in complex c. toward pg1259 + 593 an improved fuse spectrum also allows us to measure the -1083 line , which shows that n()@xmath8n ( ) . the intrinsic n / o ratio can be approximated by /@xmath80.15 .",
    "this can be compared with value for n / o measured in irregular galaxies@xcite , in the outer parts of normal spirals@xcite and in damped ly@xmath22 absorbers@xcite , which shows that only in the latter kind of object are values found that are as low as in complex  c.    taken together , the abundances and ratios are compatible with the notion that complex  c consists of gas in which heavy elements were produced only by type ii sne , explaining the low fe and n abundances , the high ratios of @xmath22-element abundances ( si , s ) over o , as well as the apparent absence of dust .",
    "blitz et al.@xcite proposed that most hvcs are intra - local - group clouds , assuming ( a ) that they contain dark matter and ( b ) have a median distance of 1mpc .",
    "possibly the subset of smaller , compact hvcs forms this population . in this model",
    "each hvc is assumed to be self - gravitating and its distance and mass can be derived from observables ( velocity dispersion , area and flux ) using the virial theorem , assuming a value for @xmath23 , the ratio of the  mass to the total mass ( + h@xmath16+he+dark matter ) .",
    "blitz et al .",
    "favor @xmath23=0.1 .",
    "figure 3 shows the resulting  mass function for the subset of compact hvcs , for @xmath23=0.1 ( thin dotted line ) and @xmath23=0.01 ( thick dotted line ) .",
    "these distributions are compared to the  mass function of the local group ( lower solid line ) and of the general field derived from a deep arecibo survey@xcite , scaled to match the local group at m()@xmath79(upper solid line ) .    clearly ,",
    "if the hvcs are virially stable and have @xmath23=0.1 , there would be 1050 times more massive hvcs in the local group than galaxies .",
    "there would also be 50200 times more than in a comparable volume outside groups .",
    "there are four ways to reconcile this discrepancy .",
    "first , the local group may be unusual and indeed have many more massive starless  clouds than the general field .",
    "second , the field  mass function may have been underestimated by a factor @xmath810 .",
    "third , the value of @xmath23 may 0.01 or lower ( e.g.  by increasing the ionization ) .",
    "however , this implies that most distances are in the range 20200kpc , and the hvc ensemble would not fill the local group , but rather be concentrated around the milky way .",
    "none of these three possibilities seems likely .",
    "fourth , only a small fraction of the hvc sample may be local group objects . for @xmath23=0.1 there might be up to 510 such objects without causing a discrepancy . for lower @xmath23 proportionally more are allowed to exist .",
    "in its first two years of operation , fuse has observed 219 extra - galactic objects . of the 154 observations that were public as of september 2001",
    ", a reasonable measurement of galactic  absorption can be obtained in 85 cases ( wakker et al .",
    "& sembach et al . , in preparation ) . in 56 of these sightlines high - negative or high - positive velocity",
    "there is clearly high - velocity  associated with complex  c : in all nine sightlines projected onto that hvc it is detected , although in three of these the  only extends out to the velocity where the  peaks . in one sightline through complex  a a weak -hvc can be seen .",
    "the magellanic stream is detected toward fairall9 . in eight other cases",
    "a  hvc lies just a few degrees away and has a velocity similar to that of the high - velocity .",
    "twelve sightlines lie in the region @xmath12=180330 , @xmath13@xmath735  and show absorption at velocities @xmath7 + 200 .",
    "another eleven lie in the region @xmath12=20140 , @xmath13@xmath9@xmath1030  and show absorption at velocities ranging from @xmath10400 to @xmath10150  ( six of the sightlines near a  hvc probably also belong to this group ) . apart from these associations and groupings , there are 14 more sightlines with high - velocity .    in the case of complex  c",
    "a possible explanation for the associated absorption is that its outer envelope is heated by friction while it moves closer to the galaxy .",
    "no explicit models of this process exist , however , and it will require the measurement of other highly - ionized atoms , such as  and  to discern between the possible explanations .",
    "the concentration of twelve sightlines with high - positive  lies diametrically opposed to the concentration of seventeen with high - negative absorption .",
    "the latter lies near the direction to m31 and other local group galaxies , which may indicate that we are detecting a filament of hot gas in the local group through which the milky way is moving .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the velocities and distribution of high - velocity  will be needed to confirm this possibility .",
