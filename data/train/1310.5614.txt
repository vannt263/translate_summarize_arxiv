    "the quantum slit diffraction experiment of electrons was first realized experimentally in 1961 by c. jnsson , see @xcite and @xcite , but the first experimental proof of the quantum diffraction for individual electrons was shown in the seventies by o. donati , p. g. merli , g. p. missiroli and g. pozzi , @xcite,@xcite using electron biprisms and later independently by a. tonomura , j. endo , h. ezawa , t. matsuda and t. kawasaki @xcite .",
    "the quantum diffraction phenomenon has been interpreted via the famous thought experiment imagined by richard feynman in @xcite .",
    "we mention that this double slit experiment has recently also been done experimentally @xcite in a situation where the probability distribution for individual electron on the screen was observed ( statistically ) while varying the position of a mask hiding one , two or none of the slits .",
    "in addition , nano - slit electron experiments were recently performed , see for example @xcite .",
    "furthermore , slit experiments were carried out with neutrons , see @xcite and the references therein , ultracold atoms @xcite and with heavy molecules such as @xmath0 , see @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "feynman and hibbs also treated in detail a quantum slit diffraction model using the path integral formalism to compute the quantum slit propagator .",
    "the model consists of a one - dimensional slit appearing in the motion of an electron at a time @xmath1 and then removed instantaneously , the electron striking the screen at a time @xmath2 .",
    "actually , this means that the motion of the electron from the source to the screen consists of two independent motions , the first from the source to the slit and the second from the slit to the screen . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the quantum propagator for the single - slit system can be written as a product of the free propagator in the @xmath3-direction orthogonal to the slit and the propagator along the one - dimensional slit axis @xmath4 : see @xcite and @xcite for pedagogical presentations of this model .",
    "this so - called `` _ _ truncation assumption _ _ '' or `` _ _ truncation approximation__''@xcite is convenient and valid under certain conditions .",
    "first , we suppose that the particle passes through the aperture at the classical time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance between the emittor and the center of the slit , @xmath3 is the distance between the emittor and the screen , and @xmath7 is the classical velocity related to the wave length @xmath8 by the de broglie relation @xmath9 . here",
    "we assume @xmath10 because we have @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the size of the slit , and we take @xmath13 where @xmath4 is the position of the particle detected on the screen .",
    "this assumption means that the motion along the @xmath3-axis is classical whereas the one parallel to the screen ( in the @xmath4 direction ) is quantum .",
    "the main goal of this article is to find the condition justifying the latter assumption , i.e. the classical behavior of the particle along the @xmath3-axis , independently of the fact that we consider the aperture of the slit to be relatively small , and also to obtain a correction to the single - slit propagator formula and to analyse the resulting effect on the probability density function for different regimes .    at this stage",
    ", we should mention that another curious quantum diffraction phenomenon was imagined in 1952 m. moshinsky @xcite .",
    "he showed that for a monochromatic plane wave moving along a one - dimensional line , if a perfectly absorbing screen is placed at a fixed position on the axis at the times @xmath14 and is removed at the time @xmath15 , the probability density function would be similar to the one observed for the diffraction in space by a half - plane . by analogy , therefore , we call this phenomenon _ diffraction in time_. it was first observed experimentally in 1997 by the cold atom team of the kastler brossel institute in paris , see @xcite . in the mean time , the problem of diffraction in both space and time of monochromatic plane waves for a perfectly reflective slit - screen was treated in @xcite .",
    "they used the green s function method , giving the general solution of the diffusion equation @xcite in the half - space delimited by the plane of the slit with given boundary conditions .",
    "another approach was developed in @xcite to construct the quantum propagator for a purely absorbing screen .",
    "also , some recent progress have been made in @xcite where an exactly solvable model of diffraction in time for a perfectly absorbing shutter was developed .",
    "there are other recent articles @xcite , @xcite and review @xcite , on the diffraction in time phenomenon .",
    "also we refer the reader to the series of articles dealing with diffraction in space and time for gaussian wave packets @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where the autor discusses the effect of the finite width of the wave packet .    in this article , we use the brukner - zeilinger approach @xcite to construct the three - dimensional quantum slit propagator of a gaussian wave packet for general boundary conditions on the slit ( absorbing or reflective ) , and to derive a semi - classical formula for the propagator taking into account the diffraction in time . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the following model .",
    "consider a particle , modeled by a three - dimensional gaussian wave packet of width @xmath16 , which is emitted at the time @xmath17 from the position @xmath18 .",
    "the aperture of the slit is closed until the time @xmath19 after which it is opened and the wave packet propagates from the rectangular aperture of the slit ( centered at @xmath20 ) to a screen ( centered at @xmath21 ) where the position @xmath22 of the particle is detected at a time @xmath23 . in section iii",
    ", we derive an explicit integral formula for the single - slit propagator ( for a rectangular aperture ) for arbitrary boundary conditions on the plane of the slit , in the case where the times of emission of the particle and of opening of the slit coincide : @xmath24 .",
    "after that , we will show that there is a _ semi - classical transition _ , when the parameter @xmath25 is large , where @xmath26 is the position of the particle detected on the screen at the time @xmath27 .",
    "we will also interpret the semi - classical propagator formula as a sum over classical paths going through the aperture at different times depending on the position at which the particle passes through the slit . to illustrate the semi - classical transition we calculate numerically the probability density function for a narrow gaussian wave packet , @xmath28 .",
    "in section iv we give a correction to the truncation approximation propagator in the fraunhofer regime when the dimensions of the aperture are small compared to the distance between the slit and the screen .",
    "then we give a formula for the shift in the distance between two successive minima of the probability distribution function compared to the classical result . in the last section",
    ", we discuss an experimental perspective to the diffraction pattern for a relatively large aperture of the slit , particularly for the slit diffraction experiment in the presence of a constant gravity field .",
    "the aim of this section is to recall the theory of diffraction in space and time and to give a general solution to the schrdinger equation for an initial gaussian wave packet on the half space delimited by a plane .",
    "the purpose of this study is to give the physical ingredients and the mathematical tools to treat the problem of the slit diffraction beyond the truncation approximation .",
    "the latter main problem will be explored in the subsequent sections .",
    "the diffraction - in - time experiment consists of opening a shutter at position @xmath29 at a time @xmath30 and observing the particle at a point @xmath21 after the opening time @xmath31 . in @xcite as well as in @xcite ,",
    "the wave at the source is considered to be a monochromatic plane wave .",
    "here we consider , as in @xcite , a localized wave packet ( gaussian ) , but we follow the method developed in @xcite to find the general solution . to understand the difference between the localized wave packet versus plane wave , we notice that the phase of the wave is non - linear in space and in time ( for one dimension @xmath32 ) and so the coordinate and time of emission of the localized wave has to be taken into account ( which is not the case for a plane wave since the phase is linear in time , @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , for the truncation approximation model , the half - plane diffraction amplitude for a gaussian wave packet is given by fresnel integrals ( see @xcite ) whereas for a plane wave this amplitude is given by the fourier transform of the shape of the aperture ( for example of a two dimensional gate function for a rectangular aperture ) .",
    "we will see that the result for the space diffraction of a localized wave packet by an half - plane is actually similar to the so - called `` diffraction in time '' .    to give a general solution of the diffraction in space and time problem",
    ", we first write the schrdinger equation for the wave function of the particle moving in the apparatus : @xmath34 here we fixed the initial condition in the half - plane to be zero at times @xmath35 and inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions on the plane of the slit @xmath36 for @xmath37 . in @xcite ,",
    "the boundary condition is taken to be a monochromatic plane wave @xmath38 , whereas here we will consider a localized wave packet ( gaussian ) .",

    "we have also seen that we can interpret this phenomenon as a diffraction in time by analogy with the diffraction in space . however , since the main problem of this article is to derive a formula for the slit diffraction problem , where the aperture is not assumed to be small compared with the distance between the slit and the screen ( and the slit and the source ) , we would like to interpret the so - called diffraction in time phenomenon in a different way , where the apparatus is fixed in time ( no shutter ) and the problem is stationary . in this section ,",

    "the resulting formula will be analyzed in the semi - classical limit using the stationary phase approximation method which yields a semi - classical interpretation of the propagator .",
    "the one - slit propagator is then given by an integral of this one - point source propagator over the aperture of the slit . finally , the wave function on the screen at time @xmath27 is given by ( [ psis2 ] ) , where we consider an initial narrow gaussian wave packet ( [ psi0 ] ) of width @xmath16 which is small compared to the distance between the center of the gaussian and the slit and also to the size of the aperture : @xmath110 by ( [ psis2 ] ) we then have the following approximation : @xmath111 therefore , in the sequel we will take @xmath112 in ( [ kslit1 ] ) since the final wave function is just proportional to the one - slit propagator .",
    "remark_. in the limit @xmath113 , we would like to give a formula for the probability density for the particle to be at the point @xmath26 on the screen at the time @xmath27 .",
    "this has already been done for the truncation approximation , see @xcite and appendix 1 , and",
    "the general idea here is similar .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath114 represents the non - normalized wave function at the point @xmath26 on the screen at the time @xmath27 and so , to get the probability , we have to divide by the total mass on the screen : @xmath115 for the truncation approximation model , the particle is assumed to pass through the slit at the classical time @xmath116 ( given by a linear relation between @xmath27 and the distances along the @xmath3-axis ) . hence , the total mass passing to the right side of the plane of the slit is equal to the total mass on the screen : @xmath117 however , in our model there is no similar conservation equation to ( [ pclaw ] ) since we do not know the exact time when the particle passes through the aperture .",
    "hence , the expression for the probability density at the point @xmath26 and at the time @xmath27 has to written as @xmath118 . + the formula ( [ kslit1 ] ) can be rewritten as an integral over all points @xmath119 in the slit ( i.e. @xmath120 $ ] and @xmath121 $ ] ) : @xmath122 where we have defined the three - dimensional one - point source propagator : @xmath123g_0(\\bold{r}-\\bold{r}_1,t-\\tau)g_0(\\bold{r}_1-\\bold{r}_0,\\tau)\\ .\\ ] ] we want to give an explicit formula for the one - point slit propagator ( [ ks1 ] ) . for a detailed calculuation we refer the reader to appendix 2 .",
    "the result is the following explicit formula : @xmath124 where the phase is given by @xmath125 and where the amplitude is given by a linear combination of the neumann and dirichlet amplitudes : @xmath126 the neumann part is given by : @xmath127 and the dirichlet part by : @xmath128    _ remark . _",
    "the equation ( [ krew ] ) gives the correct propagator formula for the slit diffraction problem , whatever the initial condition for the wave at @xmath17 .",
    "for example , we can take the following more general condition than ( [ psik0 ] ) : @xmath129 where @xmath130 are small but @xmath131 is large , and consider in the limit delta - distributions along the @xmath132- and @xmath4-axis and a plane wave along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "then , the approximation we made for @xmath28 is still valid in the plane of the slit but not on the @xmath3-axis which can be considered the _",
    "propagation axis_. in this limit , to get the wave solution , we have to compute the fourier transform of ( [ krew ] ) with respect to @xmath71 : @xmath133      in the following we still assume that the opening of the aperture of the slit coincides with the emission of the gaussian wave packet @xmath24 , and that the width of the gaussian is small compared to the distances of the apparatus , @xmath134 , so that ( [ psis3 ] ) gives a good approximation to the solution .",
    "now we will give the semi - classical approximation of the propagator ( [ krew ] ) when the fluctuation of the phase tends to zero , i.e. considering that @xmath135 and so that @xmath136 with @xmath137 .",
    "this allows us to interpret the propagator of the slit experiment in this regime as the sum over classical paths starting from @xmath138 at the time @xmath17 to @xmath26 at the time @xmath27 given that the particle passes through the slit @xmath139 at a so - called _ semi - classical time _",
    "the results are similar to the ones obtained for the truncation approximation model ( see @xcite and appendix 1 ) but not the same since we do not make any geometrical approximation and , as a consequence , @xmath141 depends on the coordinates @xmath60 of the classical paths passing through the slit .",
    "we should mention that another condition for the validity of the semi - classical approximation is that the distances @xmath142 and @xmath143 have to be of the same order for every @xmath144 , which means that @xmath145 and @xmath146 are also of the same order , and that the sizes of the aperture @xmath147 and the position of the screen @xmath148 have to be at most of the same order as @xmath146 .",
    "+ by the above assumptions , we are able to use the stationary phase approximation applied to the one - point propagator formula([ks1 ] ) : @xmath149 where @xmath141 is the solution of the equation @xmath150 , @xmath151 is the second derivative of @xmath64 at the point @xmath141 , and where we put @xmath152    by a direct calculation , we find that the saddle point @xmath141 which is the solution of the equation @xmath150 is given by @xmath153 then we get : @xmath154 to estimate the integral at the right hand side of ( [ sp0 ] ) , we need to integrate in the complex plane along a contour , which we take to be the perimeter of the eighth part of a circle centered at @xmath155 on the real axis and of radius @xmath27 , together with the radii . putting @xmath156 , we get the following estimate for large @xmath157 : @xmath158 since the latter integral is of the order @xmath159 .",
    "hence by ( [ sp0 ] ) and ( [ estimate ] ) , we get the following approximation for the one - point propagator : @xmath160 the stationary phase approximation method , leading to the formula ( [ sc1 ] ) , thus yields the propagator ( [ kssol ] ) except for the last terms of ( [ ad ] ) and ( [ an ] ) .",
    "indeed , the phase is the same and the amplitude is a linear combination of the first term of the amplitudes ( [ ad ] ) , ( [ an ] ) .",
    "we can explain this result remarking that both first terms in ( [ ad ] ) and ( [ an ] ) are large compared to the second terms since the ratio is of the order @xmath161 .",
    "rewriting the semi - classical propagator ( [ sc1 ] ) using ( [ sp2 ] ) we have @xmath162}{2\\hbar(t-\\tau_{sc})}}}{2i\\pi\\hbar ( t-\\tau_{sc})/m } \\frac{e^{\\frac{im [ y_1 ^ 2+z_1 ^ 2]}{2\\hbar\\tau_{sc}}}}{2i\\pi\\hbar\\tau_{sc}/m},\\ ] ] where the function @xmath163 is defined by @xmath164 and where @xmath165 can be interpreted as the semi - classical path length traveled by the particle : see fig .",
    "hence the one - slit propagator formula ( [ krew ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath166}{2\\hbar(t-\\tau_{sc})}}}{2i\\pi\\hbar ( t-\\tau_{sc})/m } \\frac{e^{\\frac{im [ y_1 ^ 2+z_1 ^ 2]}{2\\hbar\\tau_{sc}}}}{2i\\pi\\hbar\\tau_{sc}/m}\\ ] ]    the formula ( [ sc3 ] ) is similar to the one - point source propagator in the truncation approximation , formula ( [ ktr ] ) of appendix 1 , except that the semi - classical time @xmath141 depends on the distance from the origin to the point in the slit , and from the slit to the screen ( see ( [ tc ] ) ) , and the function @xmath163 in front of the product of the two gaussians depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "+    _ remark 1_. we can give a geometric interpretation to the diffraction in space and in time in the semi - classical regime .",
    "the first - order term of the semi - classical approximation ( [ sc2 ] ) gives only the classical path contribution .",
    "therefore , we observe that the propagator ( [ sc3 ] ) is nothing but a sum over all _ semi - classical paths _ ( made up of two broken lines ) passing through the aperture of the slit as in fig.1 . thus , the equation ( [ sc3 ] ) shows that the semi - classical approximation is in fact a truncation approximation since one sees in these formulas that the motion along the @xmath3-axis and the motion in the orthogonal @xmath22 plane are separated and moreover that along the @xmath3-axis the motion is classical .",
    "however , we have more information within our model since by ( [ tc ] ) we notice that there is a relation between the classical times @xmath141 and @xmath27 even if the two motions from the source to the slit and from the slit to the screen are separated , see fig .",
    "1 . actually , we can interpret this relation as the conservation of the classical energy of the particle when the particle passes through the slit : @xmath167 and this leads to ( [ tc ] ) , whereas the classical momentum is not conserved due to the quantum diffraction phenomenon .",
    "consequently , in the semi - classical regime , the theory of diffraction in time allows us to take into account all the classical paths ( passing through the slit at a time depending on the position inside the aperture ) without assuming that the dimensions of the aperture are small compared to the dimension of the apparatus along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "moreover , the additional term ( [ sigma ] ) which could not be discovered otherwise , has an important physical meaning since the values of the parameters @xmath168 depend on whether the screen of the slit is reflective , absorbing or neither .    in fig.2 .",
    ", appendix 3 we show the transition between the quantum and the semi - classical regimes from the left to the right .",
    "firstly , for the diffraction patterns at the left side ( fig.2.1a-2.4a ) , the _ semi - classical parameter _",
    "@xmath169 ( i.e. , relatively close to one ) and so that explain why the curves are different from those for the truncation approximation ( see fig.2.4a ) .",
    "we observe that for the dirichlet boundary condition ( fig.2.1a ) there is a narrow central peak decreasing very fast so that we can not see the oscillations ( a numerical zoom could show these slight oscillations ) . on the contrary , for the neumann ( fig.2.2a ) and the free boundary conditions ( fig.2.3a )",
    ", there is no central peak but large oscillations where the distance between the fringes is essentially constant but different from the distance between the fringes in the truncation approximation ( fig.2.4a ) .    for the curves at right side of ( fig.2.1c-2.4c ) ,",
    "we have @xmath170 and then we get similar pictures to those in the truncation approximation ( fig .",
    "2.4c ) although there is still a difference in the location of the fringes . in the following section",
    ", we will give a qualitative description of those differences . from ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ q ] )",
    "we can conclude that if the first minima of the curves are not too different , however we observed that the second and the third differ by @xmath171 .",
    "the patterns in the middle of fig.2 , show the transition between the quantum and the semi - classical regimes where a central peak appears also for the neumann ( fig.2.5 ) and the free boundary conditions ( fig.2.8 ) .",
    "remark 2_. let us make another remark about the probabilistic interpretation of the slit diffraction experiment in the semi - classical limit .",
    "a consequence of the last comment about the relation between the semi - classical approximation and the truncation approximation is that there is an analogous equation to ( [ pclaw ] ) giving the relation of the conservation of the probability between the aperture of the slit and the screen : @xmath172 where @xmath141 is given by ( [ tc ] ) and depends on @xmath173 , and where the semi - classical wave functions in ( [ scplaw ] ) are given by : @xmath174 so we get the following formula for the semi - classical density of probability : @xmath175 where @xmath176 is defined in ( [ scplaw ] ) and @xmath177 .",
    "the equation ( [ krew ] ) gives the three - dimensional one - gate - slit propagator as a double integral of the three - dimensional one - point - slit propagator given by the equations ( [ kssol ] ) , ( [ a ] ) and ( [ phase ] ) . despite the fact that there is no explicit formula giving the result for the gate - slit propagator , we can give an approximation when the size of the slit and the distance on the screen are relatively small , in which case it is also of interest to give an estimate for the relative shift between the minima in the interference pattern for the fraunhofer regime compared with the truncation approximation .",
    "we first want to give the semi - classical approximation of the one - point source propagator ( [ kssol ] ) when the sizes in the @xmath3-direction are relatively large compared to the sizes of the slit and of the distances of the observation point on the screen : @xmath178 and also large compared to @xmath179 ( relatively short time ) .",

    "we remark that the term @xmath227 appearing in ( [ fraap6 ] ) gives no contribution to the intensity . keeping the zeroth - order approximation for the amplitude ( [ afraap ] ) ,",
    "the fourth -order approximation gives the propagator in the @xmath4-direction : @xmath228 since @xmath229 by ( [ prtc ] ) and since @xmath230 .",
    "thus we obtain a similar result to ( [ ktr1 ] ) : @xmath231 where the function @xmath232 is defined by ( [ ktr2 ] ) , and where @xmath233 is given by @xmath234 similar to ( [ ktr4 ] ) , since @xmath235 with @xmath236 and @xmath237 , we can rewrite ( [ k4ap2 ] ) as @xmath238 where the fresnel number is : @xmath239 where @xmath202 and @xmath240 ( and we have used @xmath241 ) . by ( [ k4ap1 ] ) , we find an analogous result for the distance @xmath242 between two successive minima of the intensity ( see @xcite for a detailed approximation ) but to fourth - order approximation : @xmath243 thus , we should observe in the intensity pattern ( see fig.2c ) , a deviation of the distance between the consecutive minima from the truncation approximation given by the following law : @xmath244      as we saw in the last section iv.b , the 4th - order correction involves the ratio between the distance of the observation on the screen and the distance in the @xmath3-direction between the screen and the slit .",
    "the aim of this section is to understand the condition of validity for the 4th -order correction to the truncation approximation model .",
    "here we have to assume that the system is in the semi - classical regime so that the parameter @xmath245 , introduced in section iii.b is relatively small .",
    "hence we will see that the corrections are not related to the value of the parameter @xmath245 but to the quantum fluctuation along the @xmath3-axis .",
    "we remark that in fig.3 , appendix 3 the approximation seems valid for the curves at the right side ( fig.3.1c-3.3c compared with fig.3.4c ) and at the middle ( fig.3.1b-3.3b compared with fig.3.4b ) , whereas it is not correct for the curves at the left side ( fig.3.1a-3.3a compared with fig.3.4a ) .",
    "actually , the optical resolution of the pattern has to be high enough to distinguish two successive minima , i.e. the relative difference @xmath246 , see ( [ delta ] ) , has to be small : @xmath247 this means that the distance @xmath4 on the screen has to be relatively small compared to @xmath248 ( if @xmath249 ) .",
    "we have seen that in the fraunhofer regime ( see appendix 1 and @xcite for more details ) the pattern on the screen has several minima at @xmath250 , @xmath251 with distances @xmath252 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath253 , the intensity becomes rather small compared to its maximum and so the visibility is low .",
    "if we consider that we can observe the pattern in a window @xmath254 , then by ( [ c1 ] ) we get the criterion @xmath255 hence , given the geometrical parameter @xmath256 , we obtain a condition for the ratio between the wavelength @xmath257 and the distance @xmath248 .",
    "we reintroduce the parameter @xmath258 , so that @xmath259 .",

    "the criterion ( [ c2 ] ) gives a condition : @xmath264 where the parameter called the _ coherence number in the @xmath3-direction _",
    "@xmath265 is defined as @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the _ quantum fluctuation parameter in the @xmath3-axis _ and @xmath268 with @xmath269 , is the inverse of the _ zoom parameter_.    in the fig.3 , appendix 3 for the diffraction patterns at the left side ( fig.3.1a-3.4a ) the coherence parameter is of the order of unity , and the semi - classical parameter @xmath270 ( with @xmath271 , @xmath272 ) .",
    "we observe some differences with the truncation approximation .",
    "first , the distance between the fringes is about @xmath273 in case of the first minimum and @xmath274 for the second .",
    "we conclude that in those cases , the fourth - order approximation above is not valid .",
    "however , we observe different shapes for the different boundary conditions and also the amplitude of the oscillations are not the same .",
    "if we suppose that we can experimentally ( and this is probably a big challenge ) build an apparatus for which the parameter @xmath245 is of the range @xmath275 , the differences described before would provide physical information about the surface of the slit .    for the fig.3.1b-3.4b , the parameters @xmath276 and @xmath277 ( with @xmath278 , @xmath279 ) .",
    "in this case the fourth - order approximation is quite good for the first ten fringes .",
    "for example , we have @xmath280 for the first fringe shift , @xmath281 for the third one and @xmath282 for the fifth one .",
    "additionally , we observe that the shape of the curves as well as the amplitude of the oscillations do not depend on the boundary conditions .    similarly for the fig.3.1c-3.4c , the parameters @xmath283 and @xmath284 ( with @xmath285 , @xmath286 ) and we obtain diffraction patterns very close to the truncation approximation .",
    "in the next section , we will see that experimentally this is the general situation .",
    "concerning the two - slit problem , we observed that for large @xmath245 and for small fresnel numbers ( @xmath287 , where @xmath288 is the distance between the centers of the slits along the @xmath4-axis ) the interference pattern has a similar shape to the one for the truncation approximation ( see @xcite ) , see fig .",
    "4 , appendix 3 but we observe a similar diffraction in time phenomenon for the envelope of the interference pattern which is nothing but the diffraction curve for a single - slit centered at @xmath289 .",
    "the two - slit propagator formula is given by : @xmath290 where the three - dimensional one - point source propagator @xmath291 is given by ( [ kssol ] ) .",
    "here we have only studied a rectangular aperture but naturally the propagator ( [ kslit1 ] ) can be generalized for an arbitrarily shape of slit : @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the aperture of the slit ( e.g. , circle ) and where the one - point source propagator @xmath291 is given by ( [ kssol ] ) .",
    "+ also , we mention that the semi - classical approximation is valid for two dimensions where we have to integrate ( [ kslit1 ] ) along the @xmath294-axis and apply the stationary phase approximation method . similarly to ( [ sc3 ] ) we get : @xmath295 where @xmath296 is given by ( [ sigma ] ) and with the semi - classical time @xmath141 is given by ( [ tc ] ) taking @xmath297 .      in the slit experiments for electrons , cold neutrons and heavy molecules , we point out that the dimensions of the apparatus are large",
    "so that the semi - classical parameter is very large , for example in @xcite and @xcite , @xmath245 is of the order @xmath298 , it is @xmath299 in @xcite and @xmath300 in @xcite . additionally , experimentally the initial wave function ( at the time of the emission ) is not localized at @xmath138 but a plane wave along the @xmath3-axis . as discussed above",
    ", it suffices to fourier transform the propagator ( [ krew ] ) with respect to the variable @xmath71 .",
    "however , in the cold atoms experiment @xcite the narrow wave packet model is more convenient even if for realistic conditions we do not reach the limit @xmath69 . in @xcite",
    "is presented a theoretical description and interpretation of the latter experiment , but still following the truncation approximation .",
    "concretely , a bunch of coherent cold neon atoms ( mass @xmath301 ) is trapped above a plate where there are two apertures ( the two - slits system ) at a distance @xmath302 . at the time @xmath17 the optical - magnetic trap is switch off and the atoms fall under the gravity field of the earth , passing through the two slits and strike a detection plate at distance @xmath303 from the two - slit plate .",
    "it is assumed that the initial wave of an atom falling down the gravity field is a gaussian wave packet centered at @xmath304 with an initial vector wave @xmath79 .",
    "it is also assumed that the motion along the @xmath4-axis is classical .",
    "moreover , the dimensions of the slits are considered to be small compared to the distances @xmath302 and @xmath303 which , in addition to the classical treatment along @xmath4 , is the truncation approximation . by fixing @xmath305",
    ", it follows that the classical time that the particle needs to pass through the slits is simply given by @xmath306 .",
    "then , taking @xmath307 , @xmath308 we compute @xmath309 and so @xmath310 which yields to @xmath311 .",
    "besides , in @xcite numerical simulations are performed to study the probability density for small @xmath303 showing that the interference patterns can be observed only for @xmath312 . in the fig . 4 of @xcite , the probability density is plotted especially for @xmath313 where we can observe a transition between the so - called _ separated regime _ and the _ mixed regime _ @xcite between the two - slits patterns .",
    "however the length @xmath302 was kept fixed for numerical simulation and so we may wonder what the shape pattern would be if we varied the length @xmath302 in such a way that the total length @xmath314 is of orders @xmath315 . in this situation , the semi - classical parameter @xmath245 would be of orders @xmath316 and so we expect the probability density to be modified by the fluctuation along the @xmath4-axis which should exhibit a correction to the truncation approximation model .",
    "here we will give a brief description of the modifications needed in our model to describe this experiment .",
    "again we use the brunker - zeilinger method and obtain a semi - classical approximation for the propagator .",
    "we leave the numerical simulation for another article where we will investigate the phenomenological consequences of our model .",
    "as described above , we consider gaussian wave packet ( [ psi0 ] ) centered at @xmath317 falling down the gravity field @xmath318 where @xmath319 and passing through a single slit , where the slit is an aperture in a plane orthogonal to the @xmath4-axis positioned at @xmath320 . after a time @xmath27 ,",
    "the particle is detected on a screen at the position @xmath321 .",
    "we describe the quantum - motion of the particle by the following equation similar to ( [ scheq ] ) : @xmath322 with @xmath323 and where we fixed the boundary and initial condition on the plane of the slit . as",
    "before , we consider a shutter opening at the time @xmath90 after which the wave propagates below the slit plane ( i.e. @xmath321 ) .    using the same arguments as previously but replacing the free green s function by : @xmath324 where the free propagator @xmath325 is given by ( [ green0 ] ) , we get : @xmath326 where : @xmath327    then for @xmath328 , by the stationary phase approximation we obtain : @xmath329 where the one - point source amplitude is given by @xmath330 with @xmath331 and the one - point source phase by @xmath332 here , the semi - classical time @xmath141 is the solution of the following fifth - order polynomial equation ( since after expansion , the term in @xmath333 disappears ) : @xmath334 which can be interpreted as the conservation of the classical energy of the particle passing through the aperture , the trajectories being two broken parabolas similarly to the broken straight lines for the case without gravity .",
    "the first parabolic trajectory goes from @xmath304 at the time @xmath17 to the point @xmath60 at the time @xmath335 , and the second one from @xmath60 at the time @xmath335 to the point @xmath26 at the time @xmath27 .",
    "then , the classical energies for a particle following the two trajectories are @xmath336 for the first one and @xmath337 for the second one , with the classical velocities",
    "@xmath338 @xmath339 the conservation of energy equation @xmath340 then leads to the equation ( [ tcg ] ) .",
    "+      to summarize , the fourth - order corrections are generally small for realistic experimental situations , which is to be expected a priori since the theoretical predictions fit very well with the past and current experiments .",
    "however , our model brings a new perspective investigating the quantum diffraction beyond the truncation approximation .",
    "the fluctuation along the `` propagation axis '' could in principle be quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrated experimentally for a system following the conditions ( minimum ) :    1 .",
    "the apparatus has to be of mesoscopic scale , since we have seen that the length along the `` propagation axis '' has to be of orders @xmath341 to have @xmath342 in order to be able to observe any shift in the distances between the fringes . 2 .",
    "the statistics have to be high enough to have a good accuracy so that we can detect a shift for @xmath343 and also so that the differences between the amplitude of the oscillation for different boundary conditions can be detected .",
    "to construct an experimental apparatus of this kind is certainly a challenge but perhaps not entirely beyond future advances in technology .",
    "we recall@xcite that the single `` gate '' slit propagator , centered on the @xmath3-axis of size @xmath344 on the @xmath4-axis and @xmath345 on the @xmath132-axis is given by the following formula @xcite : @xmath346}{2\\hbar(t - t_c)}}}{2i\\pi\\hbar(t - t_c)/m } \\frac{e^{i\\frac{m[(y_1-y_0)^2+(z_1-z_0)^2]}{2\\hbar t_c}}}{2i\\pi\\hbar",
