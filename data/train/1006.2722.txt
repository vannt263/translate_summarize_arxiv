    "the transition from the partonic state to the confined state is described using various phenomenological models like the _ cluster models _ @xcite@xcite and the _ string model _ @xcite . a completely independent model , based on a statistical formulation and known as _ statistical hadronization model _ @xcite , has been studied in the literature but it is not available in any official release of the monte carlo event generators for high energy physics . in this paper a short overview of the microcanonical formulation of the statistical hadronization model will be given and a new monte carlo code performing the hadronization process according to that model , ` mcsthar++ ` , and its interface to the event generator ` herwig6.510 ` @xcite will be described , showing also some preliminary results obtained for the hadronization of light quarks only .",
    "as described in @xcite , the statistical model is based on the hypothesis that in a high energy collision some extended objects made of pre - hadronic matter , called _ clusters _ or _ fireballs _ , are produced .",
    "these objects are supposed to be colorless and characterized by well defined physical quantities like energy , momentum and abelian charges .",
    "each one of these clusters hadronizes according to a pure statistical law , which for the microcanonical formulation is the following : _ every multihadronic state confined inside the cluster and conserving all the physical quantities of the cluster itself is equally likely_. in this picture of the hadronization process the cluster is treated as a microcanonical ensemble , whose partition function @xmath0 is given by @xcite    @xmath1    is the sum over all the multihadronic states @xmath2 confined inside the cluster , while the sum on the left equation is over all possible channels , corresponding to the asymptotic states , which are identified by the @xmath3-tuple of integer @xmath4 , one for each hadron species @xmath5 , and where @xmath6 is the projector on the conserved set of charges .",
    "the above partition function is then modified introducing the strangeness suppression parameter @xmath7 and multiplying the weight of each channel by the factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the total number of strange and antistrange quarks contained in the hadrons of the channel itself . at this point",
    "this hadronization model requires only _ two _ parameters , which need to be tuned on the experimental data : the @xmath7 parameter and the energy density of the clusters @xmath10 , which is taken to be equal for each cluster and which is used to convert the mass of a cluster into its volume , a quantity which appears in @xmath0 , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "` mcsthar++ ` ( * * m**onte * * c**arlo * * st**atistical * * ha**dronization in high energy * * r**eactions ) is a monte carlo code implementing the statistical hadronization model in its microcanonical formulation .",
    "it is written in object oriented ` c++ ` and it is built to take as input a set of clusters and to give in output a set of hadrons ( stable and unstable ) , coming from the microcanonical hadronization of each one of the incoming clusters . for the hadronization of these objects the exact conservation of energy - momentum , electric charge , strangeness , baryonic number , charm and beauty charge is imposed .    in the present case , ` mcsthar++ ` is interfaced to ` herwig6.510 ` @xcite , the clusters used as input for ` mcsthar++ ` are the `` standard '' ` herwig ` s clusters ( allowed to have non zero baryonic number ) and the primary hadrons produced during the hadronization are decayed using the ` herwig ` s routines for the strong and electroweak hadron decay .",
    "even if a full tuning of the model is mandatory , it is already possible to see the good behavior of the hadronization code in the preliminary results shown in this section .",
    "the theoretical predictions are obtained with no tuning at all of the ` herwig ` s parameters and with a reasonable choice of the ` mcsthar++ ` s parameters : @xmath11 and .",
    "the distributions and the multiplicity table show a comparison among ` mcsthar++ ` , ` herwig6.510 ` and lep ( opal @xcite and delphi @xcite ) data for the process @xmath12 at @xmath13 center of mass energy .",
    ".mean values of the charged particle multiplicity and of the production rate of charged pions , charged kaons and ( anti)protons , for the hadronization of light quarks only . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "` mcsthar++ ` , a new monte carlo code for the statistical microcanonical hadronization , has been presented .",
    "this code , written in ` c++ ` , will be soon available to be used with the monte carlo event generators alternatively to the standard hadronization modules , as it has been shown in this paper , where ` mcsthar++ ` has been interfaced to ` herwig6.510 ` .",
    "the next steps of this work will be focused on the tuning of ` mcsthar++ ` , completed with the hadronization of @xmath14 and @xmath15 quarks , on lep and tevatron data , and on the comparison with other available hadronization models ."
