    "located at about 1@xmath4 to the nw of the orion trapezium , the bn / kl region has been , as the closest region of massive star formation , the subject of extensive studies .",

    "( 2005 ) reported large proper motions ( equivalent to velocities of the order of a few tens of km s@xmath2 ) for the radio sources associated with the infrared sources bn and n , as well as for the radio source i. all three objects are located at the core of the bn / kl region and appear to be moving away from a common point where they must all have been located about 500 years ago . even when these proper motions are now available , there is no radial velocity information for these three sources , with the exception of the near - infrared spectroscopic study of bn made by scoville et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , that report an lsr radial velocity of + 21 km s@xmath2 for this source .",
    "in this paper we present 7 mm continuum and h53@xmath0 radio recombination line observations of the bn / kl region in an attempt to obtain additional information on the radial velocities of these sources .",
    "the 7 mm observations were made in the b configuration of the vla of the nrao , during 2007 december 14 .",
    "the central rest frequency observed was that of the h53@xmath0 line , 42951.97 mhz , and we integrated on - source for a total of approximately 3 hours .",
    "we observed in the spectral line mode , with 15 channels of 1.56 mhz each ( 10.9 km s@xmath2 ) and both circular polarizations .",
    "the bandpass calibrator was 0319 + 415 .",
    "a continuum channel recorded the central 75% of the full spectral window .",
    "the absolute amplitude calibrator was 1331 + 305 ( with an adopted flux density of 1.47 jy ) and the phase calibrator was 0541@xmath5056 ( with a bootstrapped flux density of 1.78@xmath60.08 jy ) .",
    "the phase noise rms was about 30@xmath7 , indicating good weather conditions .",
    "the phase center of these observations was at @xmath8 .",
    "the data were acquired and reduced using the recommended vla procedures for high frequency data , including the fast - switching mode with a cycle of 120 seconds .",
    "clean maps were obtained using the task imagr of aips with the robust parameter set to 0 .",
    "in figure 1 we show the image obtained from the continuum channel .",
    "three sources , bn , i and n , are evident in the image .",
    "no other sources were detected above a 5-@xmath9 lower limit of 1.75 mjy in our @xmath10 field of view .",
    "the positions , flux densities , and deconvolved angular sizes of these sources are given in table 1 .",
    "the continuum flux density of the sources has been obtained from the line - free channels .",
    "the line emission will be discussed below .",
    "the flux density obtained at 7 mm by us for bn is in good agreement with the values previously reported in the literature : we obtain a flux density of 28.6@xmath60.6 mjy , while values of 31@xmath65 and 28.0@xmath60.6 were obtained by menten & reid ( 1995 ) and chandler & wood ( 1997 ) , respectively . in the case of source i , the agreement is acceptable , since we obtain a flux density of 14.5@xmath60.7 mjy , while values of 13@xmath62 and 10.8@xmath60.6 mjy were reported by menten & reid ( 1995 ) and chandler & wood ( 1997 ) , respectively .",
    "careful monitoring would be required to test if the radio continuum from source i is variable in time .",
    "the spectral indices determined from our 7 mm observations and the 3.6 cm observations of gmez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are given in the last column of table 2 .",
    "our spectral indices for bn and i are in excellent agreement in this spectral range with the more detailed analysis presented by plambeck et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and beuther et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we have detected source n for the first time at 7 mm and this detection allows the first estimate of the spectral index of this source over a wide frequency range .",
    "the value of 0.2@xmath60.1 suggests marginally thick free - free emission , as expected in an ionized outflow .",
    "this supports the interpretation of this source as an ionized outflow by gmez et al .",
    "the position given by us in table 1 is consistent with the extrapolation of the proper motions of this source discussed by gmez et al .",

    "beuther et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that this spectral index is either the result of optically thick free - free plus dust emission , or @xmath12 free - free emission that gives rise to a power - law spectrum with an index of @xmath131.6 .    in the case of the radio source associated with the infrared source",
    "n we only have an upper limit to its size at 7 mm .",
    "in addition , gmez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) report important morphological variations over time in this source that suggest that comparisons at different frequencies should be made only from simultaneous observations .    in the case of bn",
    ", the frequency dependences of flux density and angular size ( this last parameter taken to be the geometric mean of the major and minor axes reported in tables 1 and 2 ) can be accounted for with a simple model of a sphere of ionized gas in which the electron density decreases as a power - law function of radius , @xmath14 . in this case , the flux density of the source is expected to go with frequency as @xmath15 and the angular size is expected to go with frequency as @xmath16 ( reynolds 1986 ) .",
    "the frequency dependences of flux density ( @xmath17 ) and angular size ( @xmath18 ) for bn are consistent with a steeply declining electron density distribution with power law index of @xmath19 .",
    "the continuum spectrum of bn produced by plambeck et al .",
    "( 1995 ) indicates that a constant spectral index extends from 5 to 100 ghz .",
    "we clearly detected the h53@xmath0 line emission only from bn . the spectrum is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the parameters of the gaussian least squares fit to the profile are given in table 3 .",
    "we note that the radial lsr velocity determined by us , @xmath20 km s@xmath2 , agrees well with the value of @xmath21 km s@xmath2 reported by scoville et al .",
    "( 1983 ) from near - ir spectroscopy . in a single dish study of the h41@xmath0 line made with an angular resolution of 24@xmath22 toward orion irc2 , jaffe & martn - pintado ( 1999 ) report emission with @xmath23 = -3.6 km s@xmath2 .",
    "most likely , this is emission from the ambient h  ii region , since its radial velocity practically coincides with the value determined for the large h  ii region ( orion a ) ionized by the trapezium stars ( e. g. peimbert et al .",
    "the single dish observations of the h51@xmath0 emission of hasegawa & akabane ( 1984 ) , made with an angular resolution of 33@xmath22 , most probably come also from the ambient ionized gas and not from bn .",
    "if we assume that the line emission is optically thin and in lte , the electron temperature , @xmath24 , is given by ( mezger & hglund 1967 ; gordon 1969 ; quireza et al .",
    "2006 ) :    @xmath25 = \\biggl[7100 \\biggl({{\\nu_l } \\over { ghz } } \\biggr)^{1.1 } \\biggl({{s_c } \\over { s_l } } \\biggr ) \\biggl({{\\delta v } \\over { km~s^{-1}}}\\biggr)^{-1 } ( 1 + y^+)^{-1 } \\biggr]^{0.87},\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 is the line frequency , @xmath27 is the continuum flux density , @xmath28 is the peak line flux density , @xmath29 is the fwhm line width , and @xmath30 is the ionized helium to ionized hydrogen abundance ratio . in the case of bn , we can adopt @xmath31 given that the source is not of very high luminosity , and using the values given in tables 1 and 3 , we obtain @xmath32 k. this value is similar to that determined for the nearby orion a from radio recombination lines ( e. g. lichten , rodrguez , & chaisson 1979 ) .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that we get a very reasonable estimate for @xmath24 when our previous discussion seemed to imply that bn is partially optically thick at 7 mm .",
    "one possibility is that we have two effects fortuitously canceling each other .",
    "for example , the optical thickness of the source will diminish the line emission , while maser effects ( such as those observed in mwc 349 ; martn - pintado et al .",
    "1989 ) will amplify the line .",
    "however , in an attempt to understand this result in lte conditions , we will discuss the expected lte radio recombination line emission from a sphere of ionized gas in which the electron density decreases as a power - law function of radius , @xmath14 .",
    "as noted before , the modeling of the continuum emission from such a source was presented in detail by panagia & felli ( 1975 ) and reynolds ( 1986 ) .",
    "the radio recombination line emission for the case @xmath33 has been discussed by altenhoff , strittmatter , & wendker ( 1981 ) and rodrguez ( 1982 ) . here",
    "we generalize the derivation of the recombination line emission to the case of @xmath34 .",
    "this lower limit is adopted to avoid the total emission from the source to diverge .    for a sphere of ionized gas",

    ", the free - free continuum plus radio recombination line emission will be given by an equation similar to eqn .",

    "we have also assumed that the opacity of the line and continuum processes are proportional to the line and continuum absorption coefficients , respectively , that is , that the physical depths producing the line and continuum emissions are the same . under the lte assumption , we have that    @xmath52    for @xmath53 43 ghz and typical parameters of an h ii region , we can see from eqn . ( 8) that @xmath54 , and eqn . ( 7 )",

    "the factor is 2/3 , and we reproduce the result of altenhoff , strittmatter , & wendker ( 1981 ) and rodrguez ( 1982 ) . in the case of bn",
    ", we have that @xmath58 , and we expect the attenuation factor to be 2/5 . if bn can be modeled this way , we would have expected to derive electron temperatures under the lte assumption ( see eqn .",
    "1 ) of order    @xmath59    however , from the discussion in the first paragraph of this section observationally we determine that    @xmath60    summarizing : i ) bn seems to have significant optical depth in the continuum at 7 mm , ii ) this significant optical depth should attenuate the observed recombination line emission with respect to the optically - thin case , but iii ) the line emission seems to be as strong as in the optically - thin case .    as possible explanations for the `` normal '' ( apparently optically - thin and in lte ) radio recombination line emission observed from bn we can think of two options .",
    "the first is that , as noted before , there is a non - lte line - amplifying mechanism that approximately compensates for the optical depth attenuation .",
    "the second possibility is that the free - free emission from bn at 7 mm is already optically thin .",
    "however , this last possibility seems to be in contradiction with the results of plambeck et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that suggest a single spectral index from 5 to 100 ghz .",
    "observations of radio recombination lines around 100 ghz are needed to solve this problem .",
    "a comparison with the h53@xmath0 emission from the hypercompact h  ii region g28.20 - 0.04n is also of interest .",
    "the continuum flux densities from this source at 21 , 6 , 3.6 , and 2 cm are 49 , 135 , 297 , and 543 mjy , respectively ( sewilo et al . 2004 ) . at 7 mm",
    "the continuum flux density is 641 mjy ( sewilo et al .",
    "2008 ) , indicating that the source has become optically thin at this wavelength . using the h53@xmath0 line parameters given by ( sewilo et al .",
    "2008 ) we derive an lte electron temperature of @xmath61 k , similar to the value for bn and in this case consistent with the optically - thin nature of g28.20 - 0.04n .    the non detection of h53@xmath0 emission from radio source i is consistent with its expected large optical depth .",
    "the formulation above implies @xmath62 , and an attenuation factor of 2/9 .",
    "this confirms the notion that bn and radio source i are two sources intrinsically very different in nature .",
    "this difference is also evident in the brightness temperature of both sources . at 7 mm ,",
    "the brightness temperature of a source is    @xmath63 \\simeq 0.96 \\biggl[{{s_\\nu } \\over { mjy } }   \\biggr ] \\biggl[{{\\theta_{maj } \\times \\theta_{min } } \\over { arcsec^2 } } \\biggr]^{-2}.\\ ] ]    using the values of table 1 , we get @xmath64 7,800 k for bn , confirming its nature as photoionized gas . however , for the radio source i we get @xmath64 2,600 k. so , even when source i seems to be optically thick , its brightness temperature is substantially lower than that expected for a photoionized region .",
    "reid et al . (",
    "2007 ) have discussed as possible explanations for this low brightness temperature @xmath12 free - free opacity or a photoionized disk .    following the discussion of reid et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we consider it unlikely that dust emission could be a dominant contributor to the 7 mm emission of bn or orion i. a dense , warm , dusty disk would be expected to show many molecular lines at millimeter / submillimeter wavelengths . while beuther et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and friedel & snyder(2008 ) find numerous , strong , molecular lines toward the nearby `` hot core '' , they find no strong lines toward the position of orion i ( with the exception of the strong sio masers slightly offset from orion i ) or bn .",
    "also , the brightness temperatures derived by us at 7 mm ( 7,800 k for bn and 2,600 k for source i ) are high enough to sublimate dust and suggest that free - free emission from ionized gas dominates the continuum emission .",
    "finally , the continuum spectra of bn and of source i measured by plambeck et al.(1995 ) and beuther et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , respectively , suggest that the dust emission becomes dominant only above @xmath13300 ghz .    in the case of source",
    "n , no detection was expected given its weakness even in the continuum .",
    "the h53@xmath0 line emission in the individual velocity channels shows evidence of structure but unfortunately the signal - to - noise ratio is not large enough to reach reliable conclusions from the analysis of these individual channels .",
    "however , an image with good signal - to - noise ratio can be obtained averaging over the velocity range of -21.2 to + 66.1 km s@xmath2 , using the task momnt in aips .",
    "this line image is compared in figure 3 with a continuum image made from the line - free channels .",
    "the larger apparent size of the continuum image is simply the result of its much better signal - to - noise ratio . for the total line emission we obtain an upper limit of @xmath65 for its size ,",
    "that is consistent with the size of the continuum emission given in table 1 .",
    "we also show images of the blueshifted ( -21.2 to + 22.5 km s@xmath2 ) and redshifted ( + 22.5 to 66.1 km s@xmath2 ) line emission in figure 3 .",
    "the cross in the figure indicates the centroid of the total line emission .",
    "the centroid of the line emission does not appear to coincide with the centroid of the continuum emission and we attribute this to opacity effects .",
    "an interesting conclusion comes from comparing the total line emission , with the blueshifted and redshifted components .",
    "the blueshifted emission seems slightly shifted to the sw , while the redshifted emission seems slightly shifted to the ne , suggesting a velocity gradient .",
    "this result supports the suggestion of jiang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) of the presence of an outflow in bn along a position angle of 36@xmath7 .",
    "given the modest signal - to - noise ratio of the data , it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of the velocity shift and we crudely assume it is of order one channel ( @xmath1310 km s@xmath2 ) , since most of the line emission is concentrated in the central two channels of the spectrum ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the position shift between the blueshifted and the redshifted emissions is @xmath66 ( @xmath67 au at the distance of 414 pc given by menten et al .",
    "2007 ) , significant to the 4-@xmath9 level .",
    "unfortunately , the data of jiang et al . ( 2005 ) does not include line observations and there is no kinematic information in their paper to compare with our results .",
    "the small velocity gradient observed by us in bn is consistent with a slow bipolar outflow but also with keplerian rotation around a central mass of only 0.2 @xmath68 .",
    "we presented observations of the h53@xmath0 recombination line and adjacent continuum toward the orion bn / kl region . in the continuum",
    "we detect the bn object , the radio source i ( gmr i ) and the radio counterpart of the infrared source n ( orion - n ) and discuss its parameters . in the h53@xmath0 line we only detect the bn object , the first time that radio recombination lines have been detected from this source .",
    "the lsr radial velocity of bn from the h53@xmath0 line , @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , is consistent with that found from previous studies in near - infared lines , @xmath69 km s@xmath2 .",
