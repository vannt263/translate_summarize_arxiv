    "the higgs spectrum of many well motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) often includes a charged higgs , whose detection at future colliders would constitute a clear evidence of a higgs sector beyond the minimal sm @xcite . in particular , the two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) has been extensively studied as a prototype of a higgs sector that includes a charged higgs boson ( @xmath7)@xcite . however",
    ", a definitive test of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking will require further studies of the complete higgs spectrum .",
    "in particular , probing the properties of charged higgs could help to find out whether it is indeed associated with a weakly - interacting theory , as in the case of the popular minimal susy extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , or to a strongly - interacting scenario @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these tests should also allow to probe the symmetries of the higgs potential , and to determine whether the charged higgs belongs to a weak - doublet or to some larger multiplet .",
    "decays of a charged higgs boson have been studied in the literature , including the radiative modes @xmath8 @xcite , mostly within the context of the thdm , or its mssm incarnation , and more recently for the effective lagrangian extension of the thdm @xcite .",
    "charged higgs production at hadron colliders was studied long ago @xcite , and recently more systematic calculations of production processes at lhc have been presented @xcite .",
    "current bounds on charged higgs mass can be obtained at tevatron , by studying the top decay @xmath9 , which already eliminates some region of parameter space @xcite , whereas lep bounds give approximately @xmath10 gev @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the vertex @xmath11 , deserves special attention because it can give valuable information about the underlying structure of the gauge and scalar sectors . in the first place",
    ", the decay mode @xmath12 could be detected at the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) as it was claimed in reference @xcite within the context of the mssm .",
    "furthermore , the vertex @xmath11 , can also induce the associated production of @xmath13 at hadron colliders , through a virtual @xmath14 in the s - channel , which could become a relevant production mechanism for heavy charged higgs bosons .",
    "in this paper we are interested in studying thoroughly the physics behind this important vertex .",
    "its organization goes as follows : in section 2 , we present a general analysis of the case when the higgs sector includes arbitrary higgs representations ; we derive a general formula for the vertex @xmath11 in terms of the isospin components and the hypercharge of the higgs multiplet .",
    "then , in section 3 , we apply this general discussion to study the charged higgs vertex within the thdm and the minimal susy extension of the sm ( mssm ) .",
    "results for the br of the charged higgs decay in the mssm are presented including the leading radiative corrections . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss the strength of the vertex for an extended supersymmetric model that includes a complex higgs triplet ; we perform a numerical analysis to search for values of higgs masses that allow the decays @xmath15 to procced .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a higgs sector that includes several higgs multiplets @xmath16 , which transforms under @xmath17 with isospin ( @xmath18 ) and hypercharge @xmath19 .",
    "the components of the isospin @xmath18 , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are @xmath22-dimensional representations of @xmath23 , and satisfy the algebra @xmath24",

    "@xmath25 one can define the raising and the lowering operators @xmath26 , which will be used next .",
    "the kinetic terms of the higgs multiplets are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the covariant derivative , and it takes the following form for a general multiplet , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the charge operator and the hypercharge @xmath31 is normalized to satisfy the relation @xmath32 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) will induce the gauge boson masses and the higgs - gauge vertices after spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "the higgs multiplet @xmath16 can be expanded in terms of the spinors @xmath33 , eigenstates of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as follows : @xmath36 where the components @xmath37 denote the scalar state with @xmath22 units of the electric charge , and include : @xmath38 , for @xmath39 .",
    "the spinors @xmath40 , being eigenstates of @xmath34 and @xmath41 , satisfy the following relations , @xmath42^{1/2 } ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "after ssb , the neutral higgs components acquire vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v.s ) , and one can write : @xmath47 while in some particular model it is possible that some of the @xmath48 could be absent , in the following we shall assume that @xmath49 , which corresponds to a cp - invariant vacuum .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the higgs mass matrices and interactions we need to make the substitution @xmath50 into the lagrangian ( 1 ) .",

    "when @xmath18 is integer and @xmath57 ( i.e. in real representation ) , one has : @xmath58 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath59 , which corresponds to a complex representation , and @xmath18 could be either integer or half - integer ( e.g. , higgs doublets with @xmath60 or triplets with @xmath61 ) , one has @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 when @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , one can fix the following phase convention : @xmath66 .",
    "we also notice that when @xmath18 is integer and @xmath67 , @xmath68 can contribute to @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the most general expression for the charged goldstone bosons for a higgs sector that includes an arbitrary number of multiplets @xmath70 ( either with @xmath67 or @xmath71 ) is given by : @xmath72      to derive the form of this vertex , we have to determine the physical charged higgs states @xmath74 , which must be orthogonal of the goldstone boson @xmath75 . for this",
    ", one needs to construct and diagonalize the higgs mass matrix , which requires to study the higgs potential .",
    "however , in this section we shall procced as general as possible , and we will only indicate the mixing matrix for the charged and neutral higgs states .    using the previous expansion for @xmath16 ( equation ( [ mul ] ) ) , as well as the properties of the spinors @xmath76 ( equation ( [ normalization ] ) ) , and substituting them in the equation ( [ gwhh ] ) , we obtain the general expression for the vertices of the type @xmath77 as follows , @xmath78 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{ig}{\\sqrt{2 } } w^+_\\mu \\sum_\\alpha \\sum_n t_\\alpha^{+,n-1 } \\bigg [   \\phi_\\alpha^{(n-1)(+ ) } \\overleftrightarrow{\\partial}_\\mu   ( \\phi_\\alpha^{n(+)})^ *    \\bigg ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",

    ", for the case @xmath83 we use the phase conventions : @xmath66 .",
    "thus , for theses cases the coupling @xmath81 , has the following form : @xmath88 since @xmath89 , the strenght of the vertex will depend on the mixing factors .",
    "namely , in order to obtain the coupling @xmath90 it is necessary to determine the physical higgs states of the charged and neutral sector ( cp - even ) .",
    "since we have assumed that the higgs potential is cp - invariant , the imaginary and real parts of the neutral scalar fields do not mix .",
    "thus , the physical neutral higgs bosons ( cp - even ) are determined from @xmath91 .    for the charged higgs ,",
    "we define a unitary rotation that gives the physical mass eigenstates @xmath74 as : @xmath92 then , we choose the first charged field @xmath93 to be the goldstone boson @xmath75 , while the physical charged fields @xmath74 ( for @xmath94 ) are orthogonal states to the goldstone boson .",
    "then , we can fix the first row of the matrix u , through the following expression @xmath95    for the physical neutral higgs eigenstates @xmath96 , one only needs to consider @xmath97 , and we introduce a similar unitary rotation ( @xmath98 ) that gives the mass - eigenstates , namely : @xmath99 we can also choose the first physical neutral field @xmath100 to be the lightest higgs boson , which can be identified as the light sm - like state preferred by ew radiative corrections .",
    "thus , using these rotations @xmath101 and @xmath102 , as well as the previous conventions , we find that the vertex @xmath103 is given by @xmath104   w^-_\\mu .",

    "the eigenstates of @xmath110 for the doublet are given by @xmath111 then , we can expand the higgs doublet @xmath112 in terms of the spinors @xmath113 as follows : @xmath114 for this representation the operator @xmath115 are @xmath116 and their action on the spinors @xmath113 are : @xmath117 on the other hand , for a higgs triplet with @xmath118 , one has @xmath119 and the spinors associated with the isospin eigenstates are given by : @xmath120 @xmath121 has the matrix representation @xmath122    thus , the higgs triplet @xmath123 with hypercharge @xmath57 , can be expanded in terms of the spinors @xmath124 as follows @xmath125 in this case , the action of matrix @xmath126 on the spinors @xmath124 are given by @xmath127 .",
    "the model includes one charged higgs and two neutral cp - even states , which are obtained from the weak eigenstates by orthogonal @xmath128 rotations , which are parameterized by mixing angles @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "therefore , one can write the factor @xmath131 in terms of these mixing angles ; for the light state it goes as follows : @xmath132 similarly , for the heavier neutral higgs we obtain : @xmath133 where @xmath134 depends of parameters of the higgs potential .",
    "thus , the coupling @xmath135 is quite sensitive to the structure of the covariant derivative , and could be one place where to look for deviations from the minimal thdm ( or susy ) prediction at tree - level .",
    "one of the simplest models that predicts a charged higgs is the thdm , which includes two scalar doublets of equal hypercharge , namely @xmath136 and @xmath137 , this is indeed the higgs content used in the minimal susy extension of the sm ( mssm ) . besides the charged higgs ( @xmath7 ) , the spectrum of the thdm includes two neutral cp - even states ( @xmath138 , with @xmath139 ) , as well as a neutral cp - odd state ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "diagonalization of the charged mass matrices gives the expression for the charged higgs mass - eigenstate : @xmath141 , where @xmath142 denotes the ratio of v.e.v.s from each doublet . in this case",

    "in these cases it is possible for the vertices @xmath145 to vanish , but only thanks to ad hoc combination of mixing angles .",
    "the vertex @xmath135 could induce the decay @xmath146 , whenever it is kinematically allowed . since the charged and neutral higgs masses are given by : @xmath147   ,    \\\\",

    "other relevant decays of the charged higgs boson are the modes into fermion pairs , which include the decays @xmath161 , and possibly into @xmath162 .",
    "if the charged higgs is indeed associated with the higgs mechanism , its couplings to fermions should come from the yukawa sector , and the corresponding decays should have a larger br for the modes involving the heavier fermions . a very simple test of this could be done through a comparison of the modes @xmath163 and @xmath164 , which should have very different br s .    to evaluate the branching ratios within the thdm we have used the expressions for the decay widths of the tree - level modes , as appearing in ref .",

    "similarly , the br for the mode @xmath176 is about @xmath188 ( @xmath179 ) , whereas the br for @xmath177 is about @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) . in this scenario",
    "@xmath156 clearly dominates , even above the @xmath162 mode .",
    "as it was mentioned before , one of the most popular motivations for the thdm , is that such higgs sector is in fact the one of the minimal susy extension of the sm ( mssm ) .",
    "the masses of the two cp - even neutral higgses ( @xmath138 ) and the charged pair ( @xmath7 ) , are conveniently determined in terms of the mass of the cp - odd state ( @xmath140 ) and @xmath191 .",
    "the higgs potential of the mssm has less free parameters than the thdm ; in particular the quartic couplings are given in terms of the gauge couplings , which then implies that the light higgs boson must satisfy the ( tree - level ) bound @xmath192 .",
    "however this relation receives important corrections form top / stop loops , which give an aproximate bound @xmath193 gev @xcite .    in the decoupling limit ( @xmath194 ) the parameters of the potential",

    "one also obtains an approximately degenerated spectrum of heavy higgs bosons , i.e. @xmath197 , while the mixing angles satisfy the approximate relation : @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , only the decay mode @xmath199 is allowed for most regions of parameter space of the mssm .",
    "one obtains a typical br of the order @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) for @xmath202 gev and @xmath203 .",
    "we have performed a detailed parametric search for contour regions for the branching ratio of @xmath204 , using the program hdecay @xcite , and the results are shown in fig .",

    "the supersymmetric model with two doublets and a complex triplet is one of the simplest extension of the minimal supersymmetric model that allows to study phenomenological consequences of an explicit breaking of the custodial symmetry su(2 ) @xcite .",

    ", the full scalar potential can be splitted into its neutral and charged parts , i.e. @xmath215 .    from the higgs potential one derives the minimization conditions and the scalar mass matrices .",
    "for the neutral scalars we have that the resulting mass matrix splits into two blocks , one of them ( the imaginary components ) is associated with the pseudoscalar higgs states , while the other one ( real components ) describes the masses of the scalar higgs bosons .",

    "@xmath313 increasses when @xmath309 increase . for case",
    "d , we notice a different behavior , as it is show in figs . 4 and fig . 5 , which show the br for @xmath300 y @xmath311 .",
    "now the mode @xmath199 mode gets a br of order @xmath307 for @xmath302 ; the same occurs for @xmath303 boson . when @xmath158 increase , @xmath171 mode is dominant for @xmath303 , while @xmath306 is dominant for @xmath302 .    in scenario",
    "ii , which mimics the mssm , fig .",
    "5 and 6 show the br s for @xmath300 and @xmath311 .",
    "now , the mode @xmath313 becomes dominant for @xmath314 , the lightest charged higgs boson , for any combination of of parameters .",
    "we also notice that the mode @xmath171 has a br of order of @xmath312 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mode @xmath306 is dominant for @xmath302 and @xmath303 , for any combination of the parameters .",
    "the mode @xmath171 mode gets suppressed when @xmath309 increase .",
    "finally , for scenario iii we considere the case f. here both doublets and tripet contribute equally to ssb .",
    "the results for the br s are show in fig .",
    "8 and fig . 9 for @xmath300 and @xmath311 , respectively",
    "again , we find that for @xmath314 the dominant mode is @xmath313 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath306 and @xmath315 modes is similar to the ones from scenario ii .",
    "we also find that the mode @xmath171 reaches larger br s when @xmath309 is large .",
    "we have studied the charged higgs vertex @xmath316 , within the context of several extensions of the sm that predict this vertex . for a higgs sector that includes arbitrary higgs representations",
    ", we were able to derive the general form of this vertex , i.e. its dependence on the isospin and hypercharge of the higgs multiplet .",
    "then , we evaluate the strength of this vertex for several specific models , which include : @xmath4 the thdm , both generic and the mssm version , and @xmath5 models with additional higgs triplets , for both susy and non - susy cases .",
    "when the decay @xmath317 is allowed , it can reach a br that could be detected at lhc , and would permit to test the charged higgs quantum numbers .",
    "we can summarize our results in terms of the following classification for the br , namely :          .classification of br @xmath326 according to the scheeme discussed in the text .",
    "( 1 ) for the thdm we take @xmath327 gev , @xmath328 gev . ( 2 ) we have @xmath329 for most regions of parameters .",
    "( 3 ) we consider the cases with @xmath311 , and the scenarios i , ii , iii defined in the text .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]        we can appreciate that for each model there area regions or values of parameters that correspond to one of those scenarios .",
    "therefore , the observation of the decay @xmath330 , as the dominant mode , would correspond to the thdm or scenario i of the susy triplet case , while the moderate case could arise either of thdm or mssm ( observation of more higgs bosons with the predicted properties would then be needed to descriminate among them ) , while the detection of several charged and neutral higgs bosons would correspond to a model with more elaborated higgs sector ( such as higgs triplets ) .",
    "then , some results for typical br s within each model are shown in table 1 .",
