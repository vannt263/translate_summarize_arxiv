    "a map @xmath7 : @xmath8 is called a morphism ( or map ) of posets if it preserves the non - strict order , i.e. for all @xmath9 , @xmath10 such that @xmath11 we have @xmath12 in @xmath6 . the map @xmath7 induces a simplicial map @xmath13 from @xmath2 into @xmath14 by an obvious rule .",
    "thus any poset inclusion @xmath15 induces an inclusion map of the associated simplicial complexes : @xmath16 .",
    "following d.quillen we use the construction @xmath17 to assign topological concepts to posets .",

    "the set of cosets of all subgroups ( including @xmath20 and @xmath18 ) ordered by inclusion also forms a lattice and @xmath21 is its proper part ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus the natural question arises : what homotopy type can spaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 have for arbitrary finite group @xmath18 ?",
    "k.brown , c.kratzer and j.thevenaz proved that if @xmath18 is solvable , then both @xmath24 and@xmath25 are homotopy equivalent to wedges of equidimensional spheres ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this fact is really intriguing , because a poset not associated to a finite group can have almost any homotopy type .",
    "namely , for any finite simplicial complex @xmath26 there exists a finite poset @xmath1 such that @xmath26 and @xmath2 are homotopy equivalent ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of determining the homotopy type of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for any finite group @xmath18 is still open .",
    "the case of simple groups seem to offer the main difficulty . the homotopy complementation formula by bjrner and walker ( see @xcite ) and",
    "similar results which allowed to compute the exact homotopy type of lattices of solvable groups depend on the existence of a normal subgroup and therefore can not be used in this case .",
    "studying the shellability property of subgroup lattices of finite groups shareshian proved that for certain series of finite simple groups ( @xmath27 for prime @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for prime @xmath32 ) the homotopy type of lattice @xmath24 is that of a wedge of @xmath33 circles ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the proof was based on the fact that in each case a subgroup lattice can be reduced to a 1-dimensional connected using quillen s fiber lemma .",
    "any such complex is obviously homotopy equivalent to a wedge of circles .",
    "therefore , another question may be of interest : does there exist a minimal simple group whose subgroup lattice has homotopy type different from a wedge of equidimensional spheres ?",
    "we give an example of such group by determining the exact type of @xmath34 which is a wedge of 48 circles and 48 spheres .    in this work we also use spectral sequence method to obtain estimates for betti numbers of complexes @xmath24 and @xmath25 for any finite group @xmath18 as well as more precise results for certain groups ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , for prime @xmath32 and @xmath38 ) .",

    "the main tools for dealing with topological properties of posets are the quillen s fiber lemma and the homotopy complementation formula by bjrner and walker :    let @xmath7 : @xmath47 be a map of finite posets such that upper fibers @xmath48 are contractible for all @xmath49 ( respectively , lower fibers @xmath50 are contractible for all @xmath49 ) .",

    "for example , it follows that the poset @xmath77 is homotopy equivalent to a 1-dimensional complex which is connected as well as the original poset .",
    "once can easily check that its reduced euler characteristics is -60 , hence @xmath77 is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of 60 circles .    for many minimal simple groups ( @xmath27 for prime @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for prime @xmath32 )",

    "unfortunately , lemma [ coatoms ] can not be used iterative as we can not delete any new element .",
    "thus , it is naturally to ask a question : is it possible to `` get rid '' of some maximal elements ?",

    "let @xmath1 be a finite poset , @xmath80 . then @xmath81    any element of @xmath82 is greater than any element of @xmath83 , thus any chain in @xmath84 is a union of some chain in @xmath82 and some chain in @xmath83 ( note , that either chain may be empty ) .",

    "note , that at any moment we can do the same for minimal elements .    combining the homotopy methods described above we will be able to determine the exact homotopy type of @xmath34 .",
    "shareshian made a conjecture ( see @xcite ) that for any finite group @xmath18 the simplicial complexes @xmath22 and @xmath23 are homotopy equivalent to wedges of spheres of possibly different dimensions .",
