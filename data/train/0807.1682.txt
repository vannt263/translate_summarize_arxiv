    "a primary motivation for measuring cross sections for the @xmath8 reaction near the kinematical threshold was the study of the hadronic interaction between @xmath6 and @xmath5 mesons in order to understand the structure of the scalar resonances @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "such measurements have been made possible by beams of low emittance and small momentum spread available at storage ring facilities and in particular at the cooler synchrotron cosy placed in jlich , germany  @xcite .",
    "a precise determination of the collision energy , in the order of fractions of mev , permitted to deal with the rapid growth of cross sections  @xcite and thus to take advantage of threshold kinematics like e.g.  full space phase coverage achievable with dipole magnetic spectrometers rather limited in geometrical acceptance .",
    "early experiments on @xmath0 pair production at cosy conducted by the cosy-11 collaboration revealed , however , that the total cross section at threshold is by more than seven orders of magnitude smaller than the total proton - proton production cross section making the study difficult due to low statistics  @xcite .",
    "a possible influence from the @xmath11 or @xmath12 mesons on the @xmath0 pair production appeared to be too weak to be distinguished from the direct production of these mesons based on the cosy-11 data  @xcite .",
    "recent results obtained by the anke collaboration with much higher statistics can also be explained without the need of referring to the scalars @xmath11 or @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic collection of data below  @xcite and above  @xcite the @xmath1 meson threshold combined together reveal a significant signal in the shape of the excitation function in which the @xmath3 and perhaps also the @xmath0 interaction manifests itself .",
    "these observations motivate us to search for a signal from the interaction between the @xmath6 and @xmath5 in two dimensional invariant mass distributions .",
    "the analysis is based on generalizations of the dalitz plot for four particles proposed by goldhaber et al .",
    "the knowledge about the kk and kn interactions is important in many physical fields .",
    "in addition to the already mentioned studies of the nature of the scalar resonaces @xmath10 and @xmath9 , in particular for their interpretation as @xmath13 molecules  @xcite , it is also of importance in view of discussions on the structure of the excited hyperon @xmath14 , since it is not clear whether it is a usual three quark system or whether it is a @xmath15 bound state  @xcite . furthermore , an understanding of kaon and antikaon interactions with a nucleon is essential for studies of properties of strange particles immersed in dense baryonic matter  @xcite and in the determination of the structure of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath2 reaction close to threshold have been conducted using the cooler synchrotron cosy  @xcite and the cosy-11 detection system  @xcite shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ detector ] .",
    "the target , being a beam of h@xmath16 molecules grouped inside clusters of up to 10@xmath17 atoms  @xcite , crosses perpendicularly the beam of protons circulating in the ring .    .",
    "for the description see text .",
    "[ detector ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    if at the intersection point of the cluster target and cosy beam a collision of protons leads to the production of a @xmath0 meson pair , then the reaction products having smaller momenta than the circulating beam are directed by the magnetic dipole field towards the cosy-11 detection system and leave the vacuum chamber through a thin exit foils  @xcite .",
    "tracks of positively charged particles , registered by drift chambers , are traced back through the magnetic field to the nominal interaction point leading to a momentum determination .",
    "knowledge of the momentum combined with a simultaneous measurement of the velocity , performed by means of scintillation detectors s1 and s3 , permits to identify the registered particle and to determine its four momentum vector . since at threshold",
    "the center - of - mass momenta of the produced particles are small compared to the beam momentum , in the laboratory frame all ejectiles are moving with almost the same velocity .",
    "this means that the laboratory proton momenta are almost two times larger then the momenta of kaons .",
    "therefore , in the dipole field protons experience a much larger lorentz force than kaons . as a consequence , in case of the near threshold production , protons and kaons are registered in separate parts of the drift chambers .",
    "therefore , as a first step in the reaction identification events with two protons registered in an appropriate part of the drift chambers are selected based on the time - of - flight between the s1 and s3 scintillation hodoscopes .",
    "the additional requirement that the mass of the third particle , registered at the far side of the chamber with respect to the circulating beam , corresponds to the mass of the kaon , allows to identify events with a @xmath18 reaction  @xcite .",
    "reaction at an excess energy of q = 17 mev @xcite ; ( lower panel ) missing mass distribution from upper panel after additional requirement of the signal in the dipole detector as it is described in the text .",
    "[ missing ] , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    knowing both the four momenta of positively charged ejectiles and the proton beam momentum one can calculate the mass of an unobserved system @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ missing ] ( upper panel ) presents an example of the missing mass spectrum with respect to the identified @xmath20 subsystem . in the case of the @xmath2 reaction",
    "this should correspond to the mass of the @xmath5 meson , and indeed a pronounced signal can be clearly seen at this position .",
    "the additional broad structure seen in the upper panel of fig .  [ missing ]",
    "is partly due to the @xmath21 reaction , where the @xmath22 was misidentified as a @xmath6 meson , and in part due to the @xmath6 meson production associated with the hyperons @xmath23(1405 ) or @xmath24(1385 )  @xcite .",
    "the background , however , can be completely reduced by demanding a signal in the silicon pad detectors ( mounted inside the dipole ) at the position where the @xmath5 meson originating from the @xmath2 reaction is expected ( lower panel of figure 2 ) .",
    "this clear identification allows to select events originating from the @xmath2 reaction and to determine the total and differential cross sections .",
    "+ figure  [ totalcross ] shows the excitation function for the @xmath2 reaction established by the cosy-11  @xcite group near the threshold and by anke  @xcite and disto  @xcite collaborations at higher energies .",
    "the data are form references  @xcite and the meaning of the lines is described in the text .",
    "[ totalcross ] ]    the dashed line shows the result of calculations under the assumption of a homogeneous phase space population , normalized to the disto data point ( q  =  114  mev ) . for the dashed  dotted line",
    ", the proton - proton final state interaction is included using parameterization known from the three body final state  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that calculations neglecting the interaction of kaons underestimate the experimental results by a factor of five in the vicinity of the kinematical threshold .",
    "therefore , the enhancement may be due to the influence of @xmath3 or @xmath0 interaction .",
    "and indeed , with a factorization ansatz for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 interaction , the anke collaboration described the excitation function much better  @xcite , however still underestimating the two lowest data points by more than a factor of two .",
    "this could indicate that in this region the influence of the @xmath0 interaction is significant and can not be neglected .",
    "this observation encouraged us to carry out the analysis of differencial cross sections for the low energy data at q  =  10  mev ( 27  events ) and q  =  28  mev ( 30 events ) , in spite of the fact that the available statistics is quite low  @xcite .",
    "usage of the dalitz plot for extracting information about the interaction among particles in the case of three body final states is well known .",
    "it was introduced by dalitz in a nonrelativistic application  @xcite and then extended to the relativistic case by fabri  @xcite .",
    "if the transition amplitude is constant over phase space and if additionally there is no final state interaction , the occupation of the dalitz plot would be fully homogeneous because the creation in any phase space interval would be equally probable .",
    "thus , final state interaction should show up as a modification of the event density in the dalitz plot .",

    "[ experiment ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    in the case of four particles in final state the analysis is more complex , because one needs five variables to fully describe a relative movement of particles .",
    "nevertheless , there are many different types of generalization of the dalitz plot for four - body final states . in this contribution",
    "we present a generalization proposed by goldhaber  @xcite , which we use further on for studying the interaction in the @xmath7 system .",
    "however , there exist many other approaches as described e.g.   by nyborg or chodrow  @xcite . consider a reaction yielding in the final state four particles with masses @xmath28 and total energy @xmath29 in the centre - of - mass frame . assuming that the matrix element for the process @xmath30 depends only on invariant masses of two- and three particle subsystems  @xcite the distribution of events",
    "can be expressed in some choice of five independent invariant masses e.g. : @xmath31 .",
    "assuming further that @xmath30 depends at most on @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , which corresponds to the situation where only two two - particle or one three - particle resonances are present  @xcite , one obtains the following distribution of events : @xmath34 where g is a simple analytical function of its variables  @xcite .",
    "the projection of the physical region on the @xmath35-plane gives a right isosceles triangle in which the area is not proportional to the phase space volume .",
    "it is important to note that the event density in the goldhaber plot is not homogeneous and goes to zero on the entire boundary of the plot given by the following equations : @xmath36@xcite .",
    "figure  [ experiment ]  ( upper panel ) presents the simulated distribution for the @xmath7 reaction determined taking into account only the pp ",
    "experimental event distributions after acceptance corrections for both studied excess energies are shown in the middle and lower panels .",
    "clearly the event densities in the experimental goldhaber plots differ from the simulated spectrum .",
    "in particular data show an enhancement in the range of small @xmath0 invariant masses which may signify a signal from the kaon - antikaon interaction .",
    "a similar enhancement is seen by the anke group  @xcite below the @xmath1 meson mass in the @xmath0 invariant mass distributions . as a next step in the analysis we will compare experimental data to the results of monte carlo simulations generated with various parameters of the @xmath0 interaction taking into account the @xmath37fsi , as described in references  @xcite",
