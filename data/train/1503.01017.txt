    "is the world continuous or discrete ?",
    "richard feynman @xcite motivated a discrete universe as the only way it can be simulated by its own constituents , which means by a quantum computer .",
    "einstein himself considered a discrete space - time as a possibility , however , he complained about the lack of an appropriate mathematical framework @xcite .",
    "usually we dismiss discreteness on the basis of a mathematical convenience of continuos theories .",
    "but the continuum leads to still unsolved mathematical problems in the infinitely small , problems that do not arise in the discrete .",
    "the discrete , on the other hand , seems to raise a problem : the disagreement with einstein s special relativity .",
    "the debate about the clash between a discrete space and lorentz symmetry has been recently renewed because in some approaches to quantum gravity ( such as regge calculus @xcite , spin - foam @xcite , causal sets , @xcite ) the fundamental description of space - time is a discrete structure , to which the continuum is only an approximation .",
    "the scale of this discreteness is the planck length , which is amazingly small  the planck length compared to a meter is like the electron radius compared to the size of our galaxy .    why the lorentz transformations would not work with a discrete space - time ?",
    "the objection is that a discrete space - time would not be invariant under the lorentz group , even if we take it as discrete .",
    "such a point , raised more than sixty years ago , was disproved for @xmath0 space dimensions in ref .",
    "however , it was shown that the minimum admissible boost would be huge : 0.866 times the speed of light !",
    "it seems therefore that there is no way for the reconciliation of einstein s special relativity with a discrete fabric of space - time .",
    "the issue is , however , a false problem , originating from the unnecessary requirement of enforcing a covariance designed for the continuum .",
    "the right point of view is to take the lorentz covariance only as an approximate symmetry , and recovering it in the regime where the discreteness looks continuous .",
    "this is similar to what happens for a crystalline medium , which looks isotropic at large scales , whereas instead it is highly anisotropic at microscopic scales .",
    "the smaller is the crystal structure , the more accurate is the continuum symmetry : think that the planck length is @xmath1 !",
    "the right point of view is thus to consider the continuum as an approximation of the discrete when observed at very large scales .",
    "it is thus conceptually legitimate that the lorentz transformations are actually distorted at the tiny planck scale .",
    "an example of such a distorted lorentz symmetry is that of _ doubly special relativity _",
    "@xcite , where the distorted lorentz transformations , in addition to the speed of light , preserve also an energy scale .    here",
    "we show that if we take only the very essence of the relativity principle  the invariance of the physical law under change of _ inertial representation_we get nonlinear lorentz transformations , which happen to be of the same kind as those of doubly special relativity . in the continuum description",
    "the reference frame is a cartesian coordinate system  what is called `` position representation '' in quantum theory .",
    "other representations of the dynamics are given in terms of constants of motion  such as the momentum or energy representations  and these provide a viable notion of inertial frame in a world made of countably many quantum systems .",
    "we take the pragmatic point of view that quantum theory is more efficient a description of our world than classical theory , pretty much like kepler laws for the planet orbits are more efficient than ptolemaic epicycles .",
    "we therefore consider the most general quantum discrete theory , which is a _ quantum cellular automaton _ @xcite .",
    "this consists of infinitely many quantum systems ( qubits , fermionic or bosonic fields ) , whose evolution occurs in discrete steps , and which interact _ locally _ , namely every system interacts with a bounded number of other systems .",
    "a consequence of locality is that signals propagate at finite speed over the interacting network . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to consider a single particle , and technically this simplifies the automaton to be linear in the quantum field .",
    "moreover we require that the dynamics is reversible , hence it is described by a unitary matrix : this is what is called _ quantum walk _ @xcite .    in the discrete context universality of",
    "the physical law corresponds to the homogeneity of the evolution .",
    "this implies that the network of interactions represents a group @xmath2 of `` translations '' , moving from a system to another interacting with it : this is a so - called _ cayley graph _ of @xmath2 ( see methods ) .",
    "moreover , if we want to reproduce the physical situation of flat space where parallel transports along two different paths end up in the same result , then the `` translation '' group must be abelian .",
    "this allows us to make use the fourier transform . upon",
    "denoting by @xmath3 the eigenvector of the translations corresponding to wave - vector @xmath4 , we write the quantum walk unitary operator @xmath5 as follows @xmath6    ) where we fixed @xmath7 ( @xmath8 have the same plot ) .",
    "the red surface is the usual relativistic dispersion relation @xmath9 .",
    "notice that the two surfaces get closer approaching the origin for @xmath10 . ]    where @xmath11 denotes the brillouin zone of the interaction lattice , and @xmath12 is a unitary @xmath13 dimensional matrix , with @xmath13 finite . as proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , the easiest nontrivial quantum walk has @xmath14 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath5 are obtained by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath15 which can be rewritten in relativistic notation as follows @xmath16 where we introduced the four - vectors @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 denoting the pauli matrices , and the vector @xmath21 are defined by @xmath22        the eigenvalues can be collected into two functions @xmath23 called _ dispersion relations_. in this scenario the constants of motions are @xmath4 and @xmath24 , hence a change of representation corresponds to a map @xmath25 .",
    "now the principle of relativity corresponds to the requirement that the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian2 ] ) is preserved under a change of representation as follows @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are invertible matrices .",
    ". translates the relativity principle for the qw evolution : the dynamics is left invariant by a change of observer .",
    "the simplest example of change of observer is the one given by the trivial relabeling @xmath29 and by the matrices @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is an arbitrary real function of @xmath32 .",
    "when @xmath31 is a linear function we recover the usual group of translations .",

    "walk we just add that of isotropy , it turns out that there are only two admissible quantum walks @xcite , which in the small wave - vector regime give exactly the two weyl equations for the left and right massless fermion . indeed , with the above assumptions the only possible lattice is the body centered cubic one , and modulo local unitary equivalence the two admissible quantum walks are @xmath33 where @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , with @xmath37 denoting the transposed matrix .",

    "the mapping between the vectors @xmath44 exchange chirality of the particle and double the particles to four species in total .",
    "therefore we have four different particles  two left - handed and two right - handed  namely the discreteness also doubles the particles , which is the well known phenomenon of fermion doubling @xcite .",
    "in the following the term `` small wavevector '' will denote the neighborhoods of the vectors @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "we now show that the group of symmetries of the dynamics of the quantum walks in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weyl3d ] ) contains a nonlinear representation of the poincar group , which exactly recovers the usual linear one in the small wave - vector regime . for any arbitrary non vanishing function @xmath46",
    "we can introduce the four - vector @xmath47 and rewrite the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian2 ] ) as follows @xmath48 upon denoting the usual lorentz transformation by @xmath49 for a suitable @xmath50 ( an example is provided in the supplemental material ) the brillouin zone splits into four regions @xmath51 @xmath52 centered around @xmath44 @xmath53 , such that the composition @xmath54 is well defined on each region separately ( see methods ) .",
    "the four invariant regions corresponding to the four different massless fermionic particles show that the wigner notion of  particle  as invariant of the poincar group survives in a discrete world , consistent with a physical interpretation of the fermion - doubled particles . for fixed function",
    "@xmath50 the maps @xmath55 provide a non - linear representation of the lorentz group @xcite . in figs .",
    "[ orb2d ] and [ orb3d ] we show the numerical evaluation of some wavevector orbits under subgroups of the nonlinear lorentz .",
    "the distortion effects due to underlying discreteness are evident at large wavevectors and boosts .",
    "the relabeling @xmath56 satisfies ( [ eq : invariantdynam ] ) with @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the right - handed particles , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the left - handed particles , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 being the @xmath63 and @xmath64 representation of the lorentz group , independently on @xmath65 in each pertaining region .     under the full rotation group @xmath66 . ]    for varying @xmath50 , we obtain a much larger group , including infinitely many copies of the nonlinear lorentz one . in the small wave - vector regime",
    "the whole group collapses to the usual linear lorentz group for each particle .",
    "up to now we have analyzed what happens with massless particles .",
    "a simple way to obtain the dirac equation is to pair an automaton in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weyl3d ] ) with its adjoint into a direct sum , as in ref.@xcite , thus leading to a new automaton giving the dirac equation in the small wave - vector regime",
    ". a relevant feature of the discreteness is that because of unitarity the mass parameter is upper bounded @xcite .",
    "now if one derives the full symmetry group of the dynamics as we have done for the two automata in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weyl3d ] ) one discovers that the group is a nonlinear representation of the de sitter group @xmath67 with infinite cosmological constant , with the rest mass of the particle playing the role of the additional coordinate ( see methods ) .",
    "it is noticeable that even for pure boosts the rest - mass is involved in the transformation . for rest - mass much smaller than the upper bound and for pure boosts",
    "one recovers the previous nonlinear lorentz group for zero - mass .",
    "we have seen what happens of the lorentz group in a quantum world that is discrete .",
    "the main point is to abandon the idea of enforcing the exact lorentz symmetry on the discrete , but instead to consider the symmetry as an approximate one that holds only in the small wave - vector and small mass regime .",
    "but the natural question is now : how small ? according to the common opinion the scale of discreteness @xmath68",
    "is identified with the planck scale . in terms of the maximum wavevector @xmath69 in the brillouin zone",
    ", one has @xmath70 . in the small wavevector regime",
    "we recover the simple relations @xcite @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 denoting the speed of light , the planck constant , and the time - step , respectively .",
    "then the maximum mass @xmath76 of the quantum walk is the planck - mass .",
    "a way of deriving @xmath76 and @xmath68 heuristically is to keep literally the argument of taking the mass of the particle bounded in order to keep the compton wave - length @xmath77 larger than the schwartschild radius .",
    "noticeably for @xmath78 the dispersion relation is constant , namely with no propagation of information , a situation reminiscent of a micro black hole @xcite .",
    "remarkably general relativity enters the present quantum digital framework also through the unforeseeable appearance of the de sitter symmetry group , which connects different dirac particle mass values .",
    "are these only coincidences ?",
    "the dream is that it is a new route to quantum gravity .",
    "the crucial question is now what can be actually seen experimentally .",
    "recently , experimental tests of planck - scale phenomenology have been proposed @xcite . in particular , the modification to the usual dispersion relations can in principle be detected in observation of gamma - ray bursts from deep - space events , where billions of light - year of distance can sufficiently amplify the weak vacuum dispersive behavior due to discreteness @xcite . in our context",
    "this can be proved with the free electromagnetic field derived as the two - particle sector of the quantum walk in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weyl3d ] ) @xcite .",
    "this possibility reconnects with the recent analysis of data @xcite from fermi - lat concluding that the observations set an upper - bound to the scale of discreteness which is smaller than the planck scale @xmath68 by a factor @xmath79 .",
    "the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite can be refined with a complete theoretical derivation based on ref .",
    "@xcite and on the results presented in this letter .",
    "this would also take into account the possibility of a compensating effect due to the phenomenon of relative locality @xcite . in short relative locality",
    "is the phenomenon due to the nonlinearity of the lorentz transformations , which generalizes the relativity of simultaneity to relativity of the full space - time coincidence of events .",
    "the separation of events under boost is amplified by the difference of their frequency domain .",
    "indeed the fermi - lat observation is based on a predicted time - delay between two events with a huge difference in frequency , which could then be compensated by the relative - locality effect .",
