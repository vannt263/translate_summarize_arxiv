    "observations of neutron star low - mass x - ray binaries ( ns lmxbs ) with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have led to two important discoveries : strong variability on millisecond timescales in the x - ray light curves of these systems , the so - called kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and pulsations during x - ray bursts , also known as burst oscillations @xcite .",
    "the khz qpos are relatively narrow peaks in the power density spectrum of ns lmxbs that often appear in pairs , at frequencies @xmath5 and @xmath6 that change with time .",
    "these qpos are thought to reflect motion of matter at the inner edge of an accretion disk around the neutron star .",
    "burst oscillations are short - lived ( @xmath7s ) , almost coherent pulsations seen at the rise and tail of x - ray bursts in ns lmxbs .",
    "the frequency of these oscillations , @xmath8 , increases in the tail of the bursts to an asymptotic value that is consistent with being the same in bursts separated by more than a year time @xcite .",
    "this , and the fact that in the accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsar ( amp ) sax j1808.43658 burst oscillations appear at the same frequency as the pulsations seen during persistent ( non - burst ) intervals @xcite , indicates that the frequency of these burst oscillations is equal to the spin frequency of the ns , @xmath4 .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the spin of the neutron star is directly involved in the mechanism that produces the khz qpos .",
    "this consensus stems from the first detection of khz qpos and burst oscillations in the same source , the lmxb 4u 172834 , very early on in the rxte mission . while in different observations the khz qpos appeared at different frequencies , @xmath5 in the range @xmath9 hz , and @xmath10 in the range @xmath11 hz , the frequency difference of the qpos , when both were present simultaneously , was consistent with being constant , @xmath12 hz , and also consistent with the oscillations seen during bursts in this source at @xmath13 hz @xcite",
    "this fitted with the suggestion @xcite that a beat mechanism with the neutron star spin was responsible for the khz qpos .",
    "further results on other sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appeared to confirm this picture . a detailed model , the sonic - point model , proposed by @xcite explained the observed relation between the khz qpos and the neutron star spin in terms of a beat between material orbiting at the inner edge of the disk with the keplerian frequency at that radius , and the spin of the ns .",
    "as soon as khz qpos were discovered in 4u 163653 @xcite with a frequency difference of @xmath14 hz , and burst oscillations at a frequency @xmath15 hz @xcite , it became apparent that in this source @xmath16 was inconsistent with being equal to @xmath8 , but it was close to @xmath17 .",
    "this would have been the end of the sonic - point model , unless in 4u 163653 the 581 hz frequency seen during x - ray bursts was the second harmonic of the ns spin frequency , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 hz , e.g. if the pulsed radiation came from two antipodal poles on the ns . although searches for a signal at half the burst oscillations frequency , the putative spin frequency of the neutron star @xcite , in the power spectrum of the bursts in 4u 163653 yielded no positive result @xcite , this option remained viable .",
    "when khz qpos and burst oscillations were discovered in more sources , it became apparent that there was a systematic trend in how @xmath20 and @xmath8 were related : for sources for which @xmath21 hz , @xmath22 , whereas for sources for which @xmath23 hz , @xmath24 .",
    "these two groups of sources were then called `` slow '' and `` fast '' rotators , respectively @xcite .    related to this , it is interesting to note that when plotted against each other , the frequencies of the khz qpos in 19 different sources all follow approximately the same relation @xcite .",
    "this is a priori unexpected if in each source the frequency of the upper and lower khz qpos were related to the spin frequency as @xmath25 , given that @xmath5 and @xmath10 span more or less the same frequency range in all sources of khz qpos , whereas the neutron stars in these systems have spins that span a large range of frequencies , @xmath26 hz @xcite .",
    "more khz qpo data , and more precise qpo frequency measurements , showed that at least in some sources @xmath20 was not constant , but decreased as the qpo frequencies increased @xcite , and it was always significantly lower than either @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "modifications of the sonic - point model @xcite could account for this difference , considering that the frequencies of the qpos drift slightly when the material that produces the qpos crosses the sonic point and falls onto the neutron star surface .",
    "three other results raised more serious issues against the sonic - point beat - frequency model , and eventually rendered it untenable : ( i ) @xcite found that in 4u 163653 , when the frequency of the khz qpos decreases sufficiently , @xmath20 is significantly higher than @xmath27 , which was difficult ( if not impossible ) to explain by the sonic - point model , even after the modifications introduced by @xcite ; in the amp sax j1808.43658 , ( ii ) @xcite found that the frequency of burst oscillations is equal to the ns spin frequency ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar result in another amp , xte j1814338 ) , while ( iii ) @xcite detected two simultaneous khz qpos with a frequency separation @xmath28 .",
    "if this is extended to other sources in which @xmath24 , it would also be true that for those @xmath29 , and hence @xmath30 .",
    "the sonic - point model could not explain this .",
    "but soon after the sax j1808.43658 results were published , a new model that reestablished a relation between the spin frequency of the ns and the khz qpo , the sonic - point and spin - resonance model @xcite , was proposed ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model",
    ", there is a resonance in the accretion disk at the radial distance at which the keplerian orbital frequency is equal to the neutron star spin frequency minus the vertical epicyclic frequency .",
    "this resonance could lead to either @xmath31 or @xmath32 depending on whether the disk flow at the resonance radius is smooth or clumped .",
    "in fact , the same source may in principle show both cases , but this has so far not been observed .    almost in parallel with some of these explanations , and as a result of some of the difficulties for beat - frequency models mentioned above ,",
    "a different class of models was proposed , in which the frequencies of the khz qpos were associated to two of the three epicyclic frequencies of general relativity , or a combination of those ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in these models , the ns spin frequency plays no role in setting up the frequencies of the khz qpos , except for the small corrections it introduces to the epicyclic frequencies . while these models reproduce qualitatively the trends seen in the data , and predicted other trends that were later on observed @xcite , they have problems to fit the data in detail . the main criticism to these models , however , has always been that they do not explain the fact that in several sources @xmath33 or @xmath34 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the criticism is that in these models the ns spin plays no role in the mechanism that produces the qpos .",
    "recently , @xcite compared the average frequency separation of the khz qpos , @xmath35 , with @xmath4 in six systems in which these two quantities have been measured .",
    "they suggest that , despite the low number of sources available for their analysis , @xmath36 depends weakly on @xmath4 , @xmath37 hz .    in summary ,",
    "the history of models of the khz qpos is a cycle of attempts to explain the phenomenon in relation to the spin of the ns ; each time that a new observation raised an issue against one such model , a modification of that model , or a new model , was proposed that tried to reestablish the role of the ns spin in the mechanism that produces the khz qpos .    after more than ten years from the discovery of the khz qpos , a critical assessment of the current paradigms",
    "is necessary .",
    "here we review all the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 available in the literature in order to compare the slow / fast rotator paradigm with other possibilities .",
    "we suggest that the data may in fact show that there is no relation between ns spin and khz qpos .",
    "actually , the data appear to be consistent with a situation in which the average separation in frequency of the khz qpos @xmath35 is more or less constant , independent of the spin of the neutron star in the system .",
    "the division between `` slow '' and `` fast '' rotators may be an effect of the low number of sources for which two simultaneous khz qpos and burst oscillations and/or pulsations in the persistent emission have been observed , and the fact that @xmath35 is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "we use data from the literature . for the rest of the paper",
    "we assume that the frequency @xmath8 of burst oscillations is equal to the spin frequency of the neutron star , @xmath4 ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "there are ten sources for which both @xmath20 and @xmath4 have been measured .",
    "two of these sources are the amps sax j1808.43658 and xte j1807294 , six of them are the atoll sources 4u 160852 , 4u 163653 , 4u 170243 ,",
    "4u 172834 , ks 1731260 , and 4u 191505 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a definition of the atoll class ) , and the other two are igr j171912821 and sax j1750.82900 which most likely are also atoll sources .",

    "although there are too few sources to draw firm conclusions , from this table it is apparent that the average of the @xmath20 range in the amps sax j1808.43568 and xte j1807214 is somewhat lower than for the other eight sources .    in figure [ distribution ] we show in black the distribution of measurements of @xmath20 for the ten sources with known spin frequencies in table [ table1 ] , and for the other sources of khz qpos for which the spin frequency is not known .",
    "the data for this figure were taken from the papers in which the khz qpos were measured ( see van der klis 2006 for a complete reference list ) .",
    "we note that to measure both khz qpos significantly and calculate @xmath20 , in most cases power spectra had to be selected on the basis of some property of the source ( e.g. , intensity , colours , characteristic frequency of a low- or high - frequency timing feature , etc . ; see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and averaged . in this process ,",
    "part of the information of the real distribution of @xmath20 is lost .",
    "therefore , the plots in fig . [ distribution ] do not show the real @xmath20 distribution , but just the range of values observed and a rough idea of how often a certain value of @xmath20 has been observed .",
    "this plot again suggests that the average @xmath20 of the amp , @xmath38 hz , is somewhat lower than the average @xmath20 of the other sources , @xmath39 hz .",

    "this figure shows the fact that for `` slow rotators '' , neutron stars with @xmath45 hz , the ratio @xmath46 , whereas for `` fast rotators '' , neutron stars with @xmath47 hz , the ratio @xmath48 .",
    "note that , as mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , for some sources @xmath20 is significantly different from @xmath4 or @xmath49 , respectively , hence some of the individual ratios are significantly different from 1 or 0.5 , respectively .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , have shown that there is a correlation between the frequency of the khz qpos and that of other low - frequency qpos .",
    "more specifically , all these authors have shown that when plotted vs. the frequency of the upper khz qpo , the frequency of the lower khz qpo as well as the frequency of all low - frequency qpos follow individual correlations that are consistent with being the same in five atoll sources , one z source ( see * ? ? ? * for the definition of the z class ) , three low - luminosity bursters , and two amps ( see * ? ? ? * and @xcite , for an overview of these correlations ) .",
    "the amps sax j1808.43568 and xte j1807214 show relations between the frequencies of the low - frequency qpos and @xmath10 that are similar to those of the low - luminosity bursters and atoll sources .",
    "but the relations of sax j1808.43568 and xte j1807214 are shifted with respect to those of the other sources @xcite .",
    "the shift is between the frequencies of the low - frequency qpos and @xmath10 , and is best described as a multiplication of @xmath10 by a factor close to 1.5 .",
    "the exact multiplicative factors are 1.45 for sax j1808.43568 and 1.59 for xte j1807214 , respectively .",
    "while this factor applied to @xmath10 works for the low - frequency qpos vs. @xmath10 correlations , it does not work for the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , @xcite and @xcite noticed that the @xmath5 vs. @xmath10 correlation in the amps and in the other sources could be reconciled if they also multiplied @xmath5 by _ the same factor _ that they used to describe the shift of the @xmath10 vs. low - frequency qpo correlations .",
    "( notice that @xmath5 was not used to derive that factor . )",
    "the nature of this shift is unclear , but taken at face value , a multiplicative factor applied both to @xmath5 and @xmath10 implies that the frequency difference @xmath50 must also be multiplied by this factor .",
    "the gray histogram in the lower panel of figure [ distribution ] shows the distribution of @xmath20 ( apart from the caveat described above in this section ) for the two amps xte j1807294 and sax j1808.43658 multiplied by the factors ( close to 1.5 ) taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this multiplicative factors appear to bring the values of @xmath20 in these two amp into the range of the values measured in all the other sources .",
    "the average @xmath20 of the combined sample ( atoll sources with spin frequency and the two amps multiplied by the factors close to 1.5 ) is 308 hz , and the standard deviation is 38 hz .",
    "we note that the above procedure could imply a circular argument : matching the @xmath5 vs. @xmath10 correlation of the amps and the other sources via a multiplicative factor means that also @xmath20 of the amps and of the other sources would match . however , both @xcite and @xcite determined the shift factor on @xmath10 using only the correlations between the low - frequency qpos and @xmath10 , independently of @xmath5 .",
    "they then noted that they could also match the @xmath5 vs. @xmath10 correlations of the amps and the other sources if they applied the _ same factor _",
    "( within errors ) also to @xmath5 ( thence , there would be no freedom in choosing the shift factor on @xmath5 ; see the description in * ? ? ?",
    "withal , the argument would indeed be circular if the shifts on @xmath5 and on @xmath10 turned out not to be the same . this conundrum may eventually be resolved when more shifts in other sources are observed . in the meantime , we caution the reader about the possible caveats in our procedure of multiplying @xmath3 in the amps by the factors found by @xcite and @xcite .    in figure [ after ] we show the plot of @xmath40 for the ten sources in table [ table1 ] , but now we have multiplied the @xmath20 values of the amps by the factors taken from @xcite and @xcite . as in figure [ before ] , the dashed line is the step function @xmath51 ( see above ) ; the solid line corresponds to a constant @xmath52 hz .",
    "the dotted line shows the relation @xmath53 hz from @xcite .",
    "there is a general ( but not universal ) tendency to try and include the spin of the neutron star , @xmath4 , as a key ingredient in models that explain the khz qpos . in this type of models ,",
    "the spin is related to the difference between the frequencies of the khz qpos , @xmath54 .",
    "this tendency persisted , despite the fact that several results seemed to contradict the predictions of these models .",
    "amendments to the original ideas meant that models had to appeal to rather contrived geometries to explain the data , and rather artificial classes of sources had to be introduced to explain the diversity of the results ( e.g. , the division of sources with a different relation between @xmath20 and @xmath4 into `` slow '' and `` fast '' rotators ) . here",
    "we propose that the data are in fact consistent with a simpler picture in which the frequency separation between khz qpos , @xmath20 , is independent of @xmath4 , with @xmath35 more or less constant across sources .    in figure [ 2distributions ]",
    "we compare the distribution of the @xmath20 measurements in all types of sources for which two simultaneous khz qpos have been detected ( see fig . [ distribution ] ) , with the distribution of spin frequencies of twenty three sources for which pulsations in the persistent emission or burst oscillations have been measured ( see * ? ? ? * and table [ table1 ] for the list of sources and spin frequencies ) . from this figure",
    "it is apparent that the distribution of @xmath20 measurements is much more concentrated than the distribution of spin frequencies .",
    "the distribution of @xmath20 measurements can be well described ( @xmath55 for 12 degrees of freedom ) by a gaussian with a mean value @xmath56 hz and a standard deviation @xmath57 hz ( 1-@xmath58 errors ) . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test yields a very low probability , @xmath59 , that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population . according to the paradigm of slow and fast rotators ( see  [ intro ] ) , when @xmath60 hz ( the exact value is not specified ) @xmath20 should be compared to @xmath49 instead of @xmath4 . after dividing by two",
    "the spin frequencies higher than 400 hz , a k - s test indicates that the distributions of @xmath4 and @xmath20 are marginally consistent with each other , with a k - s probability @xmath61 that the two are drawn from the same parent population .    using @xmath20 and @xmath4 for six of the atoll sources also included in our sample , @xcite proposed that @xmath20 may be ( weakly ) related to @xmath4 in a way that is different than predicted by beat - frequency models .",
    "they found that @xmath62 hz for each source to calculate @xmath63 , and the spread of the @xmath20 values as a measure of the error . in the case of ks 1731260",
    "for which there is only one measurement of @xmath20 , they instead used the error of the measurement of @xmath20 . in the case of 4u 170243",
    "all @xmath20 measurements were done over a narrow range of qpo frequencies , which may artificially reduce the spread . ] . in their analysis , @xcite treat the two amps differently , and do not include them in their fit . following the results of @xcite and @xcite , here",
    "we do include the two amps in the analysis .",
    "we take a step further than @xcite , and we advance the hypothesis that in fact @xmath20 and @xmath4 are independent quantities test applied to the data presented here , averaged in the same way as in @xcite , yields a very low probability ( between 1.7 and 1.9 @xmath58 , depending on whether we include the two amps are not ) that there is correlation between @xmath63 and @xmath4 ] .    our interpretation that @xmath20 is independent of @xmath4 relies on the discovery by @xcite and @xcite , who found that to reconcile the frequency - frequency correlations of the two amps sax j1808.43568 and xte j1807214 with similar correlations in other sources , the frequencies of the khz qpos in the amps have to be multiplied by a factor of @xmath65 ( see  [ data ] for a discussion of possible caveats of this ) . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that they can also reconcile the frequency - frequency correlations if they apply different multiplicative factors to the frequency of all variability components , except @xmath10 .",
    "( as noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* a single multiplicative factor close to 1.5 applied both to @xmath5 and @xmath10 without changing the frequency of the other variability components is the simplest option . ) .",
    "in particular , they find that if @xmath10 remains unchanged , @xmath5 of the amps sax j1808.43568 and xte j1807214 has to be multiplied by a factor @xmath66 to match the @xmath67 correlation defined by the atoll sources and low - luminosity bursters .",
    "the picture presented here does not change significantly if we only apply the @xmath68 factors to @xmath5 and calculate new @xmath20 values .",
    "although it is not the purpose of this paper to explain the nature of these factors , here we provide some ideas about their possible origin .",
    "the usual suspect is the magnetic field .",
    "a stronger field could prevent the inner edge of the disk from moving inward and , if the khz qpos are produced at that radius , a larger inner disk radius could imply lower khz qpo frequencies , @xmath5 and @xmath10 . if , on the contrary , the low - frequency variability is produced at larger radii , they would be less affected by the neutron - star magnetic field , which could explain why a shift of the frequency of the low - frequency components is not required to match the frequency - frequency correlations .",
    "the problem with this explanation is that other amps supposedly having relatively high magnetic fields , at least comparable to those in sax j1808.43568 and xte j1807214 , show no or very small shifts @xcite .",
    "also , at least one other non - pulsating source shows shifts in the correlation , although smaller than the ones in the amps : @xcite find a shift of @xmath69 for the lmxb 4u 182030 .",
    "the other sources showing significant shifts in the frequency - frequency correlations are the amps xte j0929314 , with @xmath70",
    "hz @xcite and a shift of @xmath71 @xcite , and xte j1814338 with @xmath72 hz @xcite , and a shift of @xmath73 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the shift here is marginally significant ) .",
    "a neutron - star mass difference could also explain these shifts .",
    "e.g. , in the model of @xcite , and in other models that explain the frequencies of the khz qpos in terms of epicyclic frequencies in general relativity , the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath10 depends explicitly on the neutron - star mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : as noted by @xcite , a multiplicative factor applied to the neutron - star mass translates into the same multiplicative factor applied to both khz qpos ( see eq . ( 4 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "if this ( model - dependent ) interpretation is correct , a factor @xmath65 in @xmath5 and @xmath10 for the amps implies that the neutron stars in those systems are @xmath65 times more massive than in the other atoll and z sources and the low - luminosity bursters .",
    "it is generally assumed that , due to accretion , the neutron stars in lmxbs have masses larger than the canonical @xmath74 neutron star . if the @xmath65 factor is related to a difference in neutron - star mass , this would imply uncomfortably large masses for the neutron stars in the two amps .",
    "it is somewhat more difficult to assess the effect of the mass of the neutron star on the low - frequency components , because it is not clear what frequency in the model represents the frequency of those components .",
    "if one of these low - frequency qpos were due to lense - thirring precession @xcite , its frequency would be ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the moment of inertia and the mass of the neutron star , respectively , and as usual @xmath10 is the frequency of the upper khz qpo and @xmath4 is the spin frequency of the neutron star .",
    "if this identification is correct , the spin frequencies in table [ table1 ] , a shift factor @xmath78 in the mass and in the frequency of the upper khz qpo , but no shift of the low - frequency qpos imply that the moment of inertia must be a factor @xmath79 different among some of these sources .    we know that @xmath20 is not the same in all sources @xcite and not even for the same source when more than one significant detection is available @xcite .",
    "however , it is remarkable that , other than in the two amps , in all sources in which two simultaneous khz qpos have been detected , @xmath80 is approximately the same . after applying the multiplicative factors described in @xcite and @xcite , the same is true for the two amps ( see  [ data ] for possible caveats ) .",
    "this despite the fact that the measured spin frequencies span a factor of more than @xmath81 . in the model of @xcite",
    ", @xmath20 is equal to the radial epicyclic frequency , @xmath82 which , for the case of negligible eccentricity and a non - rotating neutron star is @xmath83 , with @xmath84 the azimuthal frequency , identified with @xmath10 in their model .",
    "( for neutron stars with spins smaller than @xmath85 hz and masses in the range @xmath86 , taking a typical range of @xmath10 frequencies , the radial epicyclic frequency is within @xmath87% of the value given by this formula . )",
    "one would then expect that on average @xmath20 would be the same for all neutron stars if they all have more or less the same mass and their upper khz qpo spans more or less the same frequency range .",
    "if it is generally true that @xmath35 is more or less the same in all sources of khz qpos , the idea that there is no link between @xmath20 and @xmath4 could be tested in the case of the lmxb exo 0748676 , which has a spin frequency of @xmath88 hz @xcite . from the results in figure [ after ] , for exo 0748676 one expects @xmath89 hz , whereas models that include a direct link between neutron - star spin frequency and frequencies of the khz qpos predict that for this source @xmath20 should be either @xmath90 hz or @xmath88 hz . in fact , in the context of `` slow '' and `` fast '' rotators , for exo 0748676 @xmath20 is expected to be @xmath88 hz .",
    "( we can not discard that if two simultaneous khz qpos are detected in exo 0748676 with @xmath89 hz , there would be attempts to modify existing models , or propose completely new ones , to explain @xmath91 ratios that are an integer larger than @xmath2 . ) unfortunately , so far a single khz qpo has been observed from this source @xcite .",
    "an equally interesting test of this idea would be to find a source with a spin frequency in the range @xmath92 hz for which no ( or only a small ) shift is required to fit the frequency - frequency correlations of @xcite . a case of more or less constant @xmath35 across different sources",
    "implies that @xmath0 would be between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "actually , there is a source that may be used for this in the near future : the amp xte j1751305 has a spin frequency @xmath95 hz @xcite , whereas @xcite find that a shift of only @xmath96 applied to @xmath10 is required to match the frequency - frequency correlations .",
    "unfortunately , so far there has been no detection of two simultaneous khz qpos that would allow us to calculate @xmath3 in this source .    despite the fact that the data seem to suggest that @xmath80 is more or less the same in all sources of khz qpos ( in the cases of the amp sax j1808.43658 and xte j1807294 after applying a multiplicative factor deduced from the low - frequency qpo vs. @xmath10 correlations ; see above and @xcite and @xcite for details and possible caveats ) , we have no strong reason to discard the possibility that there are sources for which this is not the case ( even after applying factors similar to those deduced in sax j1808.43658 and xte j1807294 ) .",
    "our conjecture that there is no link between @xmath20 and @xmath4 would therefore not be weakened if a source with two simultaneous khz qpos is ever discovered , for which @xmath35 is not close to @xmath97 hz , as long as in such a source @xmath35 ( after accounting for any possible shift factor as the ones in sax j1808.43658 and xte j1807294 ; @xcite ) is different from @xmath4 and @xmath49 .    from figure [ after ] it is apparent that in sax j1808.43658 and xte j1807294 the shifts on the frequency of the khz qpos @xcite , and the idea that @xmath3 is either equal to @xmath4 or @xmath49 are inconsistent with each other .",
    "it seems unlikely that this issue can be fully resolved as long as the nature of frequency shifts remains unexplained .",
    "while here we propose that the shifts imply that @xmath20 is not equal to @xmath4 or @xmath49 , we can not completely discard that the shifts have a different explanation , and that in the two amps @xmath91 is indeed close to either @xmath2 or @xmath1 .",
    "we note , however , that even without taking the shifts into account , there is solid evidence that in several sources @xmath3 is significantly different from @xmath4 or @xmath49 ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "the question is how strong the evidence must be before the idea that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are directly linked is abandoned .",
    "to conclude , here we put forward the idea that the frequency difference of the khz qpos , @xmath3 , in neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries may not be related at all to the spin frequency , @xmath4 , of the neutron star .",
    "beat - frequency mechanisms have been proposed not just in the context of the khz qpos ; they were originally advanced in the 1980s @xcite to explain the low - frequency qpos in these systems .",
    "we can not rule out completely the hypothesis of a similar type of link between the khz qpos and the neutron - star spin , but this idea can in principle be tested and , if proven wrong , discarded .",
