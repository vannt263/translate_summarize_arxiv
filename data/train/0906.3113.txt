    "the key problem in our paper is the description of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath14 and @xmath17 .",
    "the study of the spectral theoretic properties of the semigroups of killed symmetric @xmath9-stable processes has been the subject of many papers in recent years , see for example  @xcite .",

    ", the identification of the spectral problem for @xmath17 and the so - called mixed steklov problem in two dimensions , a method developed in  @xcite , is applied for the case of the half - line @xmath18 . instead of searching for a function @xmath19 satisfying @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 for @xmath23",
    ", we solve the equivalent mixed steklov problem where @xmath24 is the laplace operator in @xmath25 .",

    "similar or related methods were also applied e.g. by deblassie and mendez - hrnandez  @xcite , and the idea can be traced back to the work of spitzer  @xcite , see also  @xcite .    when @xmath12 , the spectrum of @xmath14 is equal to @xmath30 $ ] and is of continuous type , so there are no eigenfunctions of @xmath14 in @xmath31 ( this follows easily from scaling properties of @xmath14 ; see also theorem  [ th : spec ] below ) .",

    "such a function is automatically harmonic , hence   is satisfied . using the cauchy - riemann equations",
