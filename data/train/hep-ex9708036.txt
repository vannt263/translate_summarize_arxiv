    "many years of electron - positron annihilation experiments have yielded a huge amount of data covering a vast region of centre - of - mass energies .",
    "for example , at the pep , petra , tristan and lep colliders annihilation experiments have been performed between @xmath4 and @xmath5  gev  ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "distributions of event shape observables measured from hadronic final states clearly show a dependence on the centre - of - mass energy  ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this violation of the scaling behaviour is due to the running of @xmath6 with the energy scale @xmath7 .",
    "every measurement of the value of @xmath0 from event shape distributions requires the treatment of impacts of the hadronisation of quarks and gluons which can not be calculated perturbatively .",
    "usually , phenomenological hadronisation models , available from monte carlo event generators , are employed to correct for hadronisation effects .",
    "an approach , independent of hadronisation models , to account for such non - perturbative effects are power corrections @xcite . in the following , power corrections to the mean values of event shape distributions are investigated in order to determine the strong coupling constant @xmath0 from the scaling violation that is seen in the energy dependence of the mean values .",
    "non - perturbative contributions to event shape distributions are , on general grounds , expected to give rise to corrections proportional to reciprocal powers of @xmath8 . hadronisation effects , for example , should yield a @xmath9 correction according to the _ tube model _",
    "@xcite in which hadrons emanate from a tube spanned in rapidity and transverse momentum space between quark and anti - quark .",
    "another , more formal , theoretical approach leading to power corrections deals with renormalons  @xcite , that are found in the qcd vacuum polarisation at high order perturbative calculations .",
    "power corrections may also be explained in a more phenomenological ansatz @xcite with the behaviour of the strong coupling at low scales @xmath10  gev .",
    "the perturbative expression for the energy dependence of @xmath6 gives rise to the unphysical landau pole at @xmath11 .",
    "in general , one would , in this energy regime , expect the running such that @xmath6 remains finite but eventually large for all scales down to zero ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the approach of @xcite an effective coupling constant @xmath12",
    "is introduced that absorbs all non - perturbative details of @xmath6 up to an arbitrary infrared matching scale @xmath13  gev . using the effective coupling , power corrections to , for example",
    ", the mean values of event shapes can be calculated .",
    "they turn out to be simply additive to the perturbative calculation @xmath14 .",
    "the principal structure of the power correction is  @xcite @xmath15\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath16 is a coefficient , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the power of the @xmath9 term , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the power of an enhanced power term .",
    "all these parameters depend on the particular event shape .",
    "the term in curly brackets accounts for the contribution of the perturbative expression for the running of @xmath6 at @xmath21 .",
    "it is know in next - to - leading order ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the coefficients and parameters of the power corrections have been calculated for many event shape observables  ( e.g. @xcite ) , in particular , for mean values of thrust @xmath23 , @xmath24 parameter , heavy jet mass @xmath25 , total and wide jet broadening ( respectively , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and the differential 2-jet rate @xmath28 using the durham scheme ( cf .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig - t - c - mh ] exemplifies the results of such fits for thrust , @xmath24 parameter and heavy jet mass . for comparison the plain perturbative prediction using the fitted value of @xmath0",
    "is also shown by the dashed lines .",
    "for the central values of @xmath29 and @xmath0 , @xmath30 and @xmath31  gev are used .",
    "the systematic uncertainties for @xmath29 are estimated by varying @xmath32 between @xmath33 and @xmath18 and by varying @xmath16 as stated in table  [ tab - powcor - params ] .",
    "in addition , the errors of @xmath0 include a variation of @xmath34 by @xmath35  gev .",
    "the results of the fits and the @xmath36 are given in table  [ tab - a0-as - chi ] .",
    "averaging the six values of @xmath0 weighted by their total errors , and considering correlations for the errors , yields @xmath37 where the first error is the experimental uncertainty and the second represent the deviations due to the variation of @xmath32 , @xmath34 , and @xmath16 added quadratically .",
    "this value agrees with the world average of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "experiments at e@xmath39e@xmath40 colliders have measured distributions of event shape observables over a large centre - of - mass range of @xmath41-@xmath5  gev .",
    "the distributions clearly show a scaling violation which is expected due to the running of the strong coupling constant @xmath6 .",
    "hadronisation effects contained in these distributions can be explained by soft gluon phenomena .",
    "their theoretical treatment yields corrections proportional to powers of @xmath9 in addition to the usual perturbative prediction .",
    "power corrections have been found to be useful approximations of hadronisation effects .",
    "they have been applied to determine @xmath42 from the energy dependence of the mean values of thrust , @xmath24 parameter , heavy jet mass , total and wide jet broadening , and of the differential 2-jet rate using the durham scheme .",
    "the study also uncovered that the predicted power corrections are not universal for the event shape distributions considered .",
    "thus , hadronisation effects can not be explained completely by power behaved corrections .",
