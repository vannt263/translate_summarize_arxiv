    "we refer to @xcite for a study on lipschitz functions spaces , and to @xcite and @xcite for an introduction to lipschitz - free spaces and its basic properties .",
    "one of the main properties of the lipschitz - free spaces is that it permits to interpret lipschitz maps between metric spaces from a linear point of view :    let @xmath7 and @xmath26 be pointed metric spaces , consider @xmath27 and @xmath28 the isometries that assign each @xmath29 ( respectively , each @xmath30 ) to the corresponding evaluation functional @xmath31 in @xmath16 ( respectively , @xmath32 in @xmath33 ) , and suppose that @xmath34 is a lipschitz function such that @xmath35 . then there is an unique linear map @xmath36 such that @xmath37 , that is , such that the following diagram commutes :    [ propgk ]    in particular , if @xmath7 and @xmath26 are lipschitz equivalent ( that is , there is a bi - lipschitz map between @xmath7 and @xmath26 ) then @xmath16 and @xmath33 are isomorphic .",
    "the converse is not true , even if @xmath7 and @xmath26 are assumed to be banach spaces : if @xmath10 is an infinite compact metric space , then @xmath38 is isomorphic to @xmath39 , even though @xmath9 is not lipschitz equivalent to @xmath8 in general ( recall that , if @xmath9 is uniformly homeomorphic to @xmath8 , then it is isomorphic to @xmath8 c.f .",
    "this first counterexample for the banach space case was presented by dutrieux and ferenczi in @xcite .    despite of the simplicity of the definition of the lipschitz - free spaces , many fundamental questions about their structure",
    "remain unanswered .",
    "godard @xcite characterized the metric spaces @xmath7 such that @xmath16 is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of @xmath40 as exactly those who are isometrically embeddable into @xmath41-trees ( that is , connected graphs with no cycles with the graph distance ) ; on the other hand , naor and schechtman @xcite have shown that @xmath42 ( thus also @xmath43 ) is not isomorphic to any subspace of @xmath40 . from this",

    "we will show , for instance , that for any given banach space @xmath0 , we have that @xmath44 is isomorphic to @xmath51 ( see theorem [ main1 ] ) .",
    "this provides in particular a kind of non - linear version for peczyki s decomposition method ( see corollary [ corolpeln ] ) , which in turn can be used to obtain the mentioned example by dutrieux and ferenczi of non - lipschitz equivalent banach spaces sharing the same lipschitz - free space . in fact , we show that @xmath16 is isomorphic to @xmath39 for a wider class of metric spaces ( see corollary [ corolfxfc0 ] )",
    ". we will also show that , for compact metric spaces @xmath7 which are locally bi - lipschitz embeddable in @xmath52 , we have that @xmath16 admits a complemented copy in @xmath45 ; when moreover the euclidean ball @xmath53 is bi - lipschitz embeddable in @xmath7 , we have that @xmath16 and @xmath45 are actually isomorphic ( see theorem [ main2 ] ) .",

    "it is immediate to see that , if we choose another base point @xmath22 contained in @xmath72 , to each element @xmath78 there is a corresponding @xmath79 , defined by @xmath80 , which satisfies @xmath81 , so generally it is not important which base point is chosen .",
    "recall that there are always continuous but not necessarily linear extensions from @xmath82 to @xmath14 ; for example the infimum convolution @xmath83 is such an extension and it is an isometry , although in most cases it fails to be linear .",

    ".    we will be particularly interested in the subset @xmath69 of @xmath73 consisting of the pointwise - to - pointwise continuous elements .",
    "the fact that on bounded sets of @xmath82 the weak@xmath25 and the pointwise topologies coincide implies that any element of @xmath73 is weak@xmath25-to - weak@xmath25 continuous if and only if it belongs to @xmath69 .",
