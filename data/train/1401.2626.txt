    "the concordance model of the universe , or namely @xmath0cdm model , is in very good agreement with the data obtained from planck space telescope  @xcite ; data which has provided a very high resolution image of cosmic microwave background radiation  ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "this data , in addition to a wide variety of cosmological observations such as baryon acoustic oscillations  ( bao )  @xcite , weak lensing  @xcite , supernova type ia  ( snia )  @xcite , 2df galaxy redshift survey  ( 2dfgrs )  @xcite and deep2 redshift survey  @xcite at low and high redshifts respectively , has been used to tune @xmath0cdm model . accordingly",
    ", this model implies that the content of our @xmath1 billion year old universe is built up of @xmath2 non  relativistic matter and @xmath3 unknown isotropic and homogeneous distributed matter with equation of state @xmath4 , dubbed as dark energy  ( de )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the universe turns out to be almost spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic at its largest , and is recently experiencing an accelerating phase  @xcite .",
    "although there are different models of de  @xcite and also different classifications of it concerning the equation of state  @xcite , other alternatives to general relativity ( gr ) are widely discussed in the literature in order to explain the nature of the late time cosmic acceleration . among them , the scalar ",
    "tensor theories of gravitation , as extensions of brans ",
    "dicke  ( bd ) theory of gravitation are the most well  known .",
    "these theories couple a scalar field with the einstein  hilbert lagrangian , to preserve the mach principle .",
    "bd theory of gravitation mainly suffers to bring about a fine match with the observations in the solar system , within plausible value of its parameter  @xcite .",
    "other modifications of gr concern , for instance , the replacement of the scalar field with functions of other scalars engaged in the theory , such as @xmath5  @xcite , @xmath6  @xcite and @xmath7  @xcite , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the ricci scalar , the torsion scalar and the gauss  bonnet term , respectively .",
    "these latter alternatives to gr are capable of explaining the inflation phase and the late time acceleration in a unified manner .    in this manuscript",
    ", we investigate a chameleon theory which allows the scalar field to couple with both gravity and matter .",
    "the chameleon theory of gravitation  @xcite , as another modification to gr , mainly differs from bd theory in a way that the matter term in the lagrangian , is also a function of the scalar field . in other words ,",
    "the lagrangian of matter depends on the scalar field as well as the matter field and the metric .",
    "this allows the chameleon field , while behaving lightly on larger scales , to couple to matter much stronger than gravity does , and consequently makes this kind of theory to be capable of being in agreement with observational constraints  @xcite . like other gravitational theories ,",
    "there are different models of chameleon theory regarding the way the chameleon field couples to the matter field  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that for an @xmath5 theory to be in agreement with newtonian mechanics , it has to behave like a chameleon theory , therefore placing restrictions on the forms of @xmath5 functions in the action  @xcite .",
    "as stated in  @xcite , for an @xmath5 theory to have a detectable deviation from gr at astrophysical scales , it has to be equivalent to a chameleon model .    in most of the studied chameleon models , the specific choice of matter lagrangian",
    "term enables the resulting field equations to be obtained easily .",
    "however , in this manuscript , rather than choosing a specified form of the matter lagrangian term to explain the cosmic acceleration or other observational data , we consider the most general form of it .",
    "then the field equations of the action , using the dynamical method of solving differential equations , are derived and the corresponding integral curves in phase space and global phase portraits are represented .",
    "the sections in this manuscript are arranged as follows : in section  2 the field equations of a chameleon theory are derived .",
    "section  3 briefly provides the form of these equations in the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker  ( flrw ) metric , which is a logical consequence of the cosmological principle . after deriving the field equations , a qualitative analysis of these equations",
    "is provided in section  4 .",
    "a conclusion is summarized in section  5 .",
    "following the pioneer paper of brans and dicke  @xcite , the bd lagrangian is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a positive constant .",
    "dimensional analysis leads one to interpret , @xmath13 also , the energy  momentum lagrangian , @xmath14 , is assumed to be independent of the field @xmath15 .",
    "varying the lagrangian with respect to the metric and the scalar field , and combining the results , the corresponding field equations become : @xmath16    @xmath17    and @xmath18    on the other hand , and as stated before , in a simple chameleon model , the lagrangian is identical to the bd lagrangian  ( [ lag ] ) , except it is assumed that the matter lagrangian term is also a function of @xmath15 .",
    "so , one can assume @xmath19    this results in a modification of the field equations ,  ( [ rab1 ] ) ,  ( [ tab1 ] ) and  ( [ phaa1 ] ) , to  ( [ rab2 ] ) ,  ( [ tab2 ] ) and  ( [ phaa2 ] )    @xmath20    @xmath21    and @xmath22 it is worth noting that , the function @xmath23 in the two last equations , has the role of exchanging energy between the matter and the scalar fields .",
    "this will become clearer in the next section by assigning a density function to the scalar field .",
    "these equations are the general field equations of a chameleon theory . however , to have a specific solution , one has to apply the initial ( or boundary ) conditions or symmetries considered in the specific model . in the next section the specific forms of these equations in the cosmological frame are derived .",
    "the cosmological principle states that , in the universe when viewed on sufficiently large scales , there is no preferred place or direction in space . in other words , the universe can be approximated as homogeneous and isotropic in large scales .",
    "this principle is in accordance with the large scale observational evidences and as mentioned at the end of the last section , the cosmological symmetry is not a feature of gr and can be applied to all alternatives to gr . following the cosmological principle , the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric ,",
    "namely @xmath24 is the best metric applicable to these scales in the universe , for in this frame all variables can be regarded only as a function of cosmic time .",
    "the observational evidences  @xcite also convince one to assume spatial flatness of the universe in this frame .",
    "in addition , the matter is considered to be perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath25    the field equations in this frame , after some mathematical manipulations , are simplified to @xmath26 @xmath27-\\frac{\\omega}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\dot\\phi}{\\phi}\\right)^2+\\frac{\\dot a}{a}\\frac{\\dot\\phi}{\\phi}+\\frac{4\\pi}{3 + 2\\omega}s\\label{91}\\hspace{6pt},\\ ] ] @xmath28 and @xmath29 where _ dot _ denotes derivation with respect to cosmic time @xmath30 .",
    "now , by defining @xmath31 equation  ( [ phaa2 ] ) can also be rewritten as @xmath32 which can be interpreted as a non  conserved stiff matter with equation of state @xmath33 .",
    "applying the same substitution to other field equations , one can rewrite them as @xmath34 and @xmath35+\\frac{\\dot a}{a}\\frac{\\dot\\phi}{\\phi}+\\frac{4\\pi}{3 + 2\\omega}s\\label{111}\\hspace{6pt}.\\ ] ]    to study the dynamical behaviour of the universe according to the equations above , one can introduce the following dynamical variables @xmath36 in terms of these new variables , equations  ( [ 109 ] ) ,  ( [ 110 ] ) and  ( [ 111 ] ) become @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40    now , by defining @xmath41 and @xmath42 and eliminating @xmath43 between relations  ( [ 201 ] ) ,  ( [ 202 ] ) and  ( [ 203 ] ) , one gets    @xmath44\\label{300}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45y^2\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left[\\frac{1}{q_2}\\left(\\frac{2bc}{\\alpha}+\\frac{b}{\\alpha^2}+\\frac{3b}{2\\alpha^2}\\frac{x}{y}\\right)+\\frac{q_1}{q_2q_3}\\left(2 - 2a+\\frac{2b}{\\alpha^2}+\\frac{3(\\gamma+1)b}{\\alpha^2}\\frac{x}{y}\\right ) \\right]x^2\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\left[\\frac{1}{q_2}\\left(-3+\\frac{2bc}{\\alpha}+\\frac{b}{\\alpha^2}+\\frac{3b}{2\\alpha^2}\\frac{x}{y}\\right)+\\frac{q_1}{q_2 q_3}\\left(-2a+\\frac{2b}{\\alpha^2}+\\frac{3\\gamma b}{\\alpha^2}\\frac{x}{y}\\right)\\right]xy\\right\\rbrace\\label{301 }             \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these two latter equations can be used to analyse the universe as a dynamical system . however , since the dependence of the matter lagrangian term on the scalar field is not specified , one can only have a qualitative analysis of the equations by means of @xmath46 and @xmath12 , which is the aim of the next section .",
    "as the matter lagrangian term is assumed to be a general function of the matter and the scalar fields , it is useful to explore the behaviour and the fate of the universe by drawing the phase portraits of the dynamical variables with different values of parameters @xmath12 and @xmath46 .",
    "however , the two dimensional phase plane @xmath47 is not as appropriate as desired , since it does nt tell much about the behaviour of the system at infinity .",
    "fortunately , there is a compactification method invented by henry poincar which can be used to obtain a global phase portrait of a vector field in a finite disk , namely poincar disk , which is briefly explained in figure  [ fig:11 ] .",
    "plane onto the upper hemisphere of @xmath48 with respect to its origin .",
    "evidently , the infinity of @xmath49 plane are projected onto the equator of sphere .",
    "finally , the upper hemisphere is projected onto the @xmath49 plane to get the so called poincar disk .",
    "see for example  @xcite . ]",
    "it should be mentioned that one can not expect this qualitative description to produce the exact observed cosmological eras of the universe , since in this analysis , some assumptions , for example the constancy of the equation of state of the matter field during the evolution of the universe , are used which are not manifestations of reality . however , some of the solutions provided here are capable of describing special eras of the universe , such as the big bang and the late time acceleration . regarding the definitions of the dynamical parameters , relations  ( [ 200 ] ) , @xmath50 is the hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , any exponential expansion of the universe , such as the inflation phase or the late time acceleration , is represented by vertical sections of the integral curves .",
    "the big bang , on the other hand , corresponds to the limit @xmath51 , which is represented by half of the circumference of the poincar disk . as examples ,",
    "the phase portrait and global phase portrait of three cases ( @xmath52,@xmath53),(@xmath52,@xmath54 ) and ( @xmath55,@xmath53 ) are provided in figures  [ fig : fig12 ] ,  [ fig : fig13 ] and  [ fig : fig14 ] , respectively .     and @xmath53 .",
    "these diagrams show the evolution of a dust dominated universe and include curves which can be interpreted as both the inflationary phase and the late time acceleration.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath53 .",
    "these diagrams show the evolution of a dust dominated universe and include curves which can be interpreted as both the inflationary phase and the late time acceleration.,title=\"fig : \" ]     and @xmath54 .",
    "these diagrams show the evolution of a dark matter dominated universe and include curves which can be interpreted as the manifestations of the late time acceleration.,title=\"fig : \" ]    and @xmath54 .",
    "these diagrams show the evolution of a dark matter dominated universe and include curves which can be interpreted as the manifestations of the late time acceleration.,title=\"fig : \" ]     and @xmath53 .",

    "these diagrams show the evolution of a cold dark matter dominated universe and include curves which can be interpreted as the manifestations of the late time acceleration.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we have derived the field equations of a chameleon field theory without any specific assumption about the matter lagrangian term or the functional form of dynamical variables .",
    "the corresponding dynamical system of the theory , using the cosmological time , is constructed in order to easily investigate the evolution of the universe through the phase portraits of the system .",
    "the behaviour of the universe at the infinity of phase plane can be studied using the powerful poincae compactification method which enables us to view all the information contained in phase plane in a finite disk .",
    "the global phase portraits are prepared for the two special values @xmath52 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is worth noting that the bd theory with @xmath56 is conformally invariant and so it is equivalent to the so called conformal relativity  @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath55 , on the other hand , is of special interest since it makes the bd theory consistent with the solar system measurements  @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the analysis presented above can be extended by the structural stability analysis of the field equations .",
    "the idea of a structurally stable theory is of special interest in cosmology since it guaranties the integral curves of the system not to change dramatically by small perturbations of the field equations . in other words",
    ", a cosmological model needs to be structurally stable in order to be fitted with different observational data  @xcite .",
