    "there has been an upsurge of interest in the edwards - anderson model @xcite of the short - range ising spin glass with binary couplings , @xmath3 in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "several papers addressed the following well - posed question :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is the overlap distribution @xmath4 of this model , measured at @xmath2 , trivial or non - trivial in the thermodynamic limit ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    a trivial @xmath4 consists of a single delta function , @xmath5 ; a non - trivial @xmath4 has non - vanishing support also for @xmath6 .",
    "claims were made to the effect that the nature of @xmath4 bears on the validity of the droplet picture ( dp ) @xcite versus the scenario @xcite based on mean - field theory ( mf ) @xcite .",
    "our understanding is that a non - trivial global is measured for an entire system , whose size is then extrapolated to @xmath7 . ]",
    "@xmath4 is consistent with both @xcite . in this communication",
    "we do not take sides in the dp vs mf controversy ; rather , we address the well - defined technical question posed above .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ our conclusion is that @xmath4 is non - trivial at @xmath2 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    berg et al @xcite addressed the issue directly by generating ground states @xmath8 , for 512 realizations @xmath9 of systems with sizes @xmath10 ( and for 7 realizations of @xmath11 ) . for each @xmath9",
    "they computed the overlap distribution function @xmath12 , where the overlap @xmath13 is calculated between all pairs of ground states @xmath14 .",
    "they studied the function obtained by averaging over all realizations , @xmath15_j$ ] .",
    "in particular , they evaluated @xmath16 ; the second moment of the distribution @xmath17 , and the quantity @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is defined by @xmath20 if @xmath21 for large @xmath22 , all these quantities should extrapolate to zero ( provided one uses @xmath23 ) .",
    "berg et al found that all three quantities decrease as @xmath22 grows ; they could , however , fit the data to @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , as well as to @xmath26 , indicating consistency with extrapolation to both vanishing and non - vanishing limiting values .",
    "hartmann @xcite also studied the size - dependence of @xmath18 and found that it behaves as @xmath27 with @xmath28 , indicating a trivial @xmath4 ; the same conclusion was reached by hatano and gubernatis @xcite who studied @xmath16 at finite temperatures .",
    "krzakala and martin @xcite presented arguments that also support a trivial @xmath4 .",
    "finally , very recently palassini and young @xcite evaluated @xmath4 for a sequence of temperatures and sizes @xmath29 .",
    "they evaluated @xmath18 as function of @xmath22 and @xmath30 and demonstrated that the data are consistent with a scaling form .",
    "according to their scaling , for fixed @xmath31 and sizes @xmath32 , @xmath18 goes to a constant , @xmath33 ; hence they find that @xmath4 is non - trivial at @xmath31 and trivial at @xmath2 .",
    "we will argue now that all the studies mentioned measured a compound quantity , @xmath18 , which is the sum of two parts ; one which is relevant to the question asked , and another which is irrelevant .",
    "furthermore , for some of the sizes studied , the irrelevant part is as large as the relevant one",
    ". we will show how can one isolate the relevant part , and present the results obtained when this is done .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath4 is non - trivial at @xmath2 .    for a particular realization @xmath34 has , at @xmath2 , the typical form presented in fig [ fig : pqj ] .",
    "it has a large peak centered at some @xmath35 , and one or more smaller peaks .",
    "the largest peak is due to the overlap of pairs of states that belong to the _ same _ pure state .",
    "denote the overlap distribution of such pairs by @xmath36 .",
    "the other peaks , at lower @xmath37 , are due to the overlap between states that belong to two _ different _ pure states .",
    "the corresponding overlap distribution is @xmath38 and we have @xmath39 where the second equation is the average of the first over all realizations .",
    "hence we can write @xmath40 irrespectively of whether @xmath4 is trivial or non - trivial , one expects that the width of @xmath41 decreases with increasing size , since @xmath42 as @xmath7 .",
    "therefore as @xmath22 increases , the integral @xmath43 decreases towards 0 ; @xmath44 on the other hand , the behavior of @xmath45 ( and @xmath46 ) _ does _ distinguish a trivial @xmath4 from a non - trivial one ; in the first case @xmath47 , while in the non - trivial case @xmath45 and @xmath46 do not vanish as @xmath7 .",
    "we believe that previous analysis was hindered by the lack of ability to decompose @xmath4 and @xmath18 into its two constituent parts ; a method that we developed recently enables us to perform this task .",
    "we describe below how we can use a very recently developed method  @xcite to identify unabiguously , for a large majority of the realizations , a partial distribution @xmath48 , which is a lower bound to @xmath38 . for realizations in which this identification is ambiguous we set @xmath48 to zero ; averageing yields @xmath49_j$ ] , which is a lower bound on @xmath45 .",
    "the corresponding lower bound on @xmath50 is given by @xmath51    we found that the rate of convergence of @xmath52 to its limiting large-@xmath22 form is non - uniform ; for the sizes studied , convergence ( with increasing @xmath22 ) is much slower , and statistical errors are much larger in the interval @xmath53 than in @xmath54 .",
    "hence we base our analysis on the latter interval , calculate @xmath55 and show that it approaches a non - vanishing limit as @xmath7 .",
    "our method has been presented in  @xcite , together with results obtained for the model ( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "full details of the method are given in  @xcite ; here we give a brief summary of the main ingredients .",
    "we have shown that an unbiased sample  @xcite of @xmath57 ground states breaks naturally into two large groups , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the states of the two sets are related by spin reversal . for a large majority of realizations",
    "the set @xmath58 also breaks into two natural subsets , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . by natural we mean that the overlap between two states that belong to the same group ( say @xmath60 ) is significantly larger than between two that belong to two different groups .",
    "this suggest that the states in these clusters belong to different pure states , separated by free energy barriers .",
    "these barriers consist of correlated spin domains @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which flip collectively when we move from a state in one cluster to a state in another cluster .",
    "the spins that belong to @xmath62 are reversed in at least @xmath64 of the pairs of states @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , the second largest domain @xmath63 contains those spins that flip in @xmath64 ( or more ) of the times we pass between pairs states , with one member in @xmath60 and the other in @xmath61 .",
    "the domains @xmath62 and @xmath63 play the role of the cores of macroscopic `` zero energy excitations ''  @xcite that flip as we go from one pure state to another .",
    "@xmath62 separates state space into @xmath58 and @xmath67 . within @xmath58",
    ", @xmath63 induces a further non - trivial separation of the states , into clusters @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "each cluster @xmath68 contains one or more pure states .",
    "when @xmath63 is large ( `` macroscopic '' ) , a pair of states @xmath69 and @xmath70 will belong to different pure states , and their overlap @xmath71 will contribute to @xmath38 .",
    "hence , we define a new distribution @xmath48 , to which only pairs of states @xmath69 and @xmath70 contribute . this function is a lower bound to @xmath72 , since we might have for some realizations a third macroscopic cluster , in which case @xmath60 contains states from more than one pure state .",
    "when this happens , some pairs of states , both taken from @xmath60 , contribute to @xmath72 , and we do not include them in @xmath48 . in order to assure that @xmath60 and @xmath61 indeed do not belong to one pure state , we consider only those realizations for which @xmath73 .",
    "otherwise , we set @xmath74 .    the method we used to partition the states was based on a clustering procedure .",
    "it is important to stress the fact that the main result of the present study , that there are states whose overlap contribution should be separated from the self - overlap peak and does not vanish in the thermodynamic limit , does _ not _ depend qualitatively on the way the state clusters are determined . in fact , any method , which projectes out a particular contribution to @xmath4 and has a nonvanishing weight in the @xmath7 limit , will lead to the same conclusion .",
    "the only requirements are that the method is applied for all system sizes in the same way and the contribution is measured in absolute weights with respect to the total @xmath4 .",
    "we determined  @xcite for each @xmath22 the size distributions @xmath75 and found that they are nearly the same for @xmath76 , indicating convergence .",
    "@xmath77 scales as @xmath78 ; for @xmath79 the average value of @xmath75 is 0.07 and its standard deviation 0.09 ; for @xmath80 the numbers are 0.08 and 0.10 , respectively .    since the limiting size distribution of @xmath63 is non - trivial , we expect a non - trivial @xmath81 as long as @xmath61 does not vanish .",
    "the size @xmath82 of this state cluster is determined by the correlation between the spins of @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "if this correlation approaches 1 , this means that @xmath63 has a low probability to flip without @xmath62 , resulting in @xmath83 .",
    "the average correlation between these domains is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the correlation between spins @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the weight of the contribution to @xmath4 by pairs of states in which @xmath63 is flipped without @xmath62 or vice versa can be evaluated @xcite by @xmath88 .",
    "we found  @xcite that @xmath89 does not extrapolate to 1 as @xmath7 .",
    "for a realization @xmath90 , in which @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the function @xmath38 will be non - trivial , i.e. it will have a finite support for @xmath93 .",
    "to show explicitly that this indeed is the case , we studied @xmath94 and @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath95_j$ ] , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pqo ] , is a conservative estimate ( and a lower bound ) for @xmath45 .",
    "it also has a clear physical meaning .",
    "@xmath94 is the distribution of overlaps between pairs of states on the two sides of the second largest free energy barrier in the system . for comparison",
    ", we also present the full @xmath4 in fig [ fig : pq ] .",
    "@xmath52 has low values and large relative errors for @xmath96 . in this range",
    "its values decrease with increasing @xmath22 . on the other hand , in the interval",
    "@xmath54 it seems to have converged .",
    "therefore we chose this range for our analysis , and calculated the integrals @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : x * ] ) ) and @xmath98 the values obtained for @xmath99 are presented in table [ tab : x ] .",
    "perhaps the most direct evidence for our claim is the manner in which the values of @xmath100 level off as the size increases , at 0.047 . on the other hand , those of @xmath97 decrease with size .",
    "we performed a fit of the latter to the form @xmath101 the results of several attempts to fit the data to this form are summarized in table [ tab : fit ] . the best fit ( with @xmath102 )",
    "was obtained for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which is close to @xmath105 . imposing this value , i.e. setting @xmath106 and fitting @xmath107 and @xmath108 , we had a somewhat larger @xmath109 ; imposing @xmath110 yields a worse fit , with @xmath111 .",
    "we believe that these results clearly show that @xmath4 is non - trivial ."
