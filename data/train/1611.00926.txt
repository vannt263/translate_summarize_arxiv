    "the primary interest of this note is the following question , which has been posed to us by white :    * consider two minimal strictly stable embedded hypersurfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 in @xmath2 which have the same boundary @xmath3 ; is there a third smooth minimal hypersurface @xmath4 with the same boundary ?    in this note we anser positively , under some suitable assumptions , cf . corollary [ c : main2 ] : the main one is that @xmath3 lies in the boundary of a smooth strictly convex subset of @xmath2 , but there are also two other assumptions of technical nature , which we discuss at the end of the next section .    if we regard @xmath0 and @xmath1 as two local minima of the plateau s problem , we expect that a `` mountain pass lemma '' type argument yields a third minimal surface @xmath4 which is a saddle point .",
    "this intuition has a long history , which for closed geodesics goes back to the pioneering works of birkhoff and ljusternik and fet ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case",
    "@xmath5 the first results regarding the plateau s problem are due to shiffman @xcite and morse and tompkins @xcite , using the parametric approach of douglas - rado , which therefore answers positively to question ( q ) if we drop the requirements of embeddedness of the surfaces .    using a degree theory approach to the plateau problem",
    ", tromba @xcite was able to derive a limited morse theory for disk - type surfaces , generalizing the morse - shiffman - tompkins result .",
    "m. struwe @xcite then developed a general morse theory for minimal surfaces of disk and annulus type , based on the @xmath6 topology ( as opposed to the @xmath7 topology used in morse - shiffman - tompkins approach ) .",
    "these ( and other related works ) were expanded by jost and struwe in @xcite , where they consider minimal surfaces of arbitrary topological type . among other things ,",
    "they succeed in applying saddle - point methods to prove the existence of unstable minimal surfaces of prescribed genus .",
    "it is well - known that the parametric approach breaks down when @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason in their celebrated pioneering works @xcite almgren and subsequently pitts developed a variational calculus in the large using geometric measure theory .",
    "the latter enabled pitts to prove in @xcite the existence of a nontrivial closed embedded minimal hypersurface in any closed riemannian manifold of dimension at most 6 .",
    "the higher dimensional case of pitts theorem was then settled by schoen and simon in @xcite .",
    "a variant of the almgren - pitts theory was later introduced by simon and smith ( cf .",
    "smith s phd thesis @xcite ) in the @xmath9-dimensional case , with the aim of producing a min - max construction which allows to control the topology of the final minimal surface .",
    "further investigations in that direction were then set forth by pitts and rubinstein in @xcite , who also proposed several striking potential applications to the topology of @xmath10-manifolds .",
    "part of this program was carried out later in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , whereas several other questions raised in @xcite constitute an active area of research right now ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "currently , min - max constructions have gained a renewed interest thanks to the celebrated recent work of marques and neves @xcite which uses the almgren - pitts machinery to prove a long - standing conjecture of willmore in differential geometry ( cf . also the paper @xcite , where the authors use similar ideas to prove a conjecture of freedman , he and wang in knot theory ) .",
    "all the literature mentioned above regards closed hypersurfaces , namely without boundary .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a similar framework in order to attack analogous existence problems in the case of prescribed boundaries .",
    "the real issue is only in the boundary regularity of the final min - max surface , as the interior regularity and much of the existence setting can be extended without problems .",
    "when the boundary @xmath3 is lying in the boundary of a strictly convex set , our theorems give full regularity of the min - max hypersurface in any dimension .",
    "the most relevant difficulty in the proof can be overcome thanks to a beautiful idea of brian white , whom we thank very warmly for sharing it with us , cf .",
    "@xcite : the elegant argument of white to get curvature estimates at the boundary is reported in section [ ss : white_est ] . in passing ,",
    "since many of the techniques are essentially the same , we also handle the case of free boundaries , which for @xmath5 has already been considered by grter and jost in @xcite and by li in @xcite ( modifying the simon - smith approach and reaching stronger conclusions ) .",
    "our min - max constructions use the simpler and less technical framework proposed by the first author and tasnady in @xcite , which is essentially a variant of that developed by pitts in his groundbreaking monograph @xcite .",
    "it allows us to avoid a lot of technical details and yet be sufficiently self - contained , but on the other hand there are certain limitations which pitts theory does not have .",
    "however , several of the tools developed in this paper can be applied to a suitable `` boundary version '' of pitts theory as well and we believe that the same statements can be proved in that framework .",
    "similarly , we do not expect any problems in using the same ideas to extend the approach of simon and smith when the boundary is prescribed .",
    "consider a smooth , compact , oriented riemannian manifold @xmath11 of dimension @xmath12 with boundary @xmath13 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath13 is strictly uniformly convex , namely :    [ a:(c ) ] the principal curvatures of @xmath13 with respect to the unit normal @xmath14 pointing inside @xmath15 have a uniform , positive lower bound .",
    "sometimes we write the condition above as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes the second fundamental form of @xmath13 ( with the choice of inward pointing normal ) and @xmath19 the induced metric as submanifold of @xmath15 .",
    "we also note that we do not really need @xmath15 to be @xmath20 since a limited amount of regularity ( for instance @xmath21 for some positive @xmath22 ) suffices for all our considerations , although we will not pay any attention to this detail .",
    "we start by recalling the continuous families of hypersurfaces used in @xcite .",
    "we fix a smooth compact @xmath23-dimensional manifold @xmath24 with boundary @xmath25 ( possibly empty ) and we will call it the _ space of parameters_.    a smooth family of hypersurfaces in @xmath15 parametrized by @xmath24 is given by a map @xmath26 which assigns to each @xmath27 a closed subset @xmath28 of @xmath15 and satisfies the following properties :    * for each @xmath29 there is a finite @xmath30 such that @xmath28 is a smooth _ oriented _ hypersurface in @xmath31 with boundary @xmath32 ; * @xmath33 is continuous in @xmath29 and @xmath26 is continuous in the hausdorff sense ; * on any @xmath34 , @xmath35 smoothly in @xmath36 .    from now on we will simply refer to such objects as _ families parametrized by @xmath24 _ and we will omit to mention the space of parameters when this is obvious from the context . additionally we will distinguish between two classes of smooth families according to their behaviour at the boundary @xmath13 .",
    "[ homotopies ] consider a smooth , closed submanifold @xmath37 of dimension @xmath38 .",
    "a smooth family of hypersurfaces parametrized by @xmath24 is constrained by @xmath3 if @xmath39 for every @xmath40 .",
    "otherwise we talk about `` uncostrained families '' .",
    "two unconstrained families @xmath41 and @xmath42 parametrized by @xmath24 are homotopic if there is a family @xmath43 parametrized by @xmath44 $ ] such that    * @xmath45 @xmath46 , * @xmath47 @xmath46 , * and @xmath48 @xmath49 and for all @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "when the two families are constrained by @xmath3 we then additionally require that the family @xmath43 is also constrained by @xmath3 .",
    "finally a set @xmath51 of constrained ( resp .",
    "unconstrained ) families parametrized by the same @xmath24 is called homotopically closed if @xmath51 includes the homotopy class of each of its elements .",
    "let @xmath51 be a homotopically closed set of constrained ( resp .",
    "unconstrained ) families parametrized by the same @xmath24 .",
    "the min - max value of @xmath51 , denoted by @xmath52 is the number @xmath53 the boundary - max value of @xmath51 is instead @xmath54 a minimizing sequence is given by a sequence of elements @xmath55 such that @xmath56 a min - max sequence is then obtained from a minimizing sequence by taking the slices @xmath57 , for a choice of parameters @xmath58 such that @xmath59 .    as it is well known ,",
    "even the solutions of the codimension one plateau problem can exhibit singularities if the dimension @xmath12 of the ambient manifold is strictly larger than @xmath60 . if we say that an embedded minimal hypersurface @xmath61 is _ smooth _ then we understand that it has no singularities .",
    "otherwise we denote by @xmath62 its closed singular set , i.e. the set of points where @xmath61 can not be described locally as the graph of a smooth function .",
    "such singular set will always have hausdorff dimension at most @xmath63 and thus with a slight abuse of terminology we will anyway say that @xmath61 is embedded , although in a neighborhood of the singularities the surface might not be a continuous embedded submanifold . when we write @xmath64 we then understand that the singular set is empty for @xmath65 .",
    "our main theorem is the following .",
    "[ t : main ] let @xmath15 be a smooth riemannian manifold that satisfies assumption [ a:(c ) ] and @xmath51 be a homotopically closed set of constrained ( resp .",
    "unconstrained ) families parametrized by @xmath24 such that @xmath66 then there is a min - max sequence @xmath57 , finitely many disjoint embedded and connected minimal hypersurfaces @xmath67 with boundaries @xmath68 ( possibly empty ) and finitely many positive integers @xmath69 such that @xmath70 in the sense of varifolds and @xmath71 for each @xmath72 .",
    "in addition :    * if @xmath51 consists of unconstrained families , then each @xmath73 meets @xmath13 orthogonally ; * if @xmath51 consists of families constrained by @xmath3 , then : @xmath74 , @xmath75 for each @xmath72 and @xmath76 whenever @xmath77 .",
    "our main concern is in fact the case ( b ) , because the regularity at the boundary requires much more effort .",
    "the regularity at the boundary for the case ( a ) is instead much more similar to the usual interior regularity for minimal surfaces and for this reason we will not spend much time on it but rather sketch the needed changes in the arguments . as an application of the main theorem we give the following two interesting corollaries .",
    "[ c : main1 ] under the assumptions above there is always a nontrivial embedded minimal hypersurface @xmath61 in @xmath15 , meeting the boundary @xmath13 orthogonally , with @xmath64 .",
    "note that the corollary above does not necessarily imply that @xmath61 has nonempty boundary : we do not exclude that @xmath61 might be a closed minimal surface . on the other hand , if @xmath61 has nonempty boundary , then it is contained in @xmath13 and any connected component of @xmath61 is thus a nontrivial solution of the free boundary problem .",
    "therefore the existence of such nontrivial solution is guaranteed by the following    [ a : stronger ] @xmath15 does not contain any nontrivial minimal closed hypersurface @xmath78 embedded and smooth except for a singular set @xmath79 with @xmath80 .    note that the property above holds if @xmath15 satisfies some stronger convexity condition than assumption [ a:(c ) ] : for instance if there is a point @xmath81 such that @xmath82 can be foliated with convex hypersurfaces , then it follows from the maximum principle .",
    "in particular both the assumptions [ a:(c ) ] and [ a : stronger ] are satisfied by any bounded convex subset of the euclidean space , or by any ball of a closed riemannian manifold with radius smaller than the convexity radius .    likewise , under the very same assumptions we can conclude the following morse - theoretical result for the plateau s problem .    [ c : main2 ] let @xmath15 be a smooth riemannian manifold satisfying assumptions [ a:(c ) ] and [ a : stronger ] and let @xmath37 be a smooth , oriented , closed @xmath83-dimensional submanifold . assume further that :    * there are two distinct smooth , oriented , minimal embedded hypersurfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath84 which are strictly stable , meet only at the boundary and bound some open domain @xmath85 ( in particular @xmath0 and @xmath1 are homologous ) .    then there exists a third distinct embedded minimal hypersurface @xmath4 with @xmath86 such that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the corollary above asks for two technical assumptions which are not really natural :    * @xmath0 and @xmath1 intersect only at the boundary ; * they are regular _",
    "everywhere_.    we use both to give an elementary construction of a @xmath89-dimensional sweepout which `` connects '' @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( i.e. a one - parameter family @xmath90}$ ] ) , but by taking advantage of more avdanced techniques in geometric measure theory and algebraic topology - as for instance pitts approach via discretized faimly of currents - it should suffice to assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are homologous and that the dimensions of their singular sets do not exceed @xmath63 .",
    "the smoothness enters however more crucially in showing that any sweepout connecting @xmath0 and @xmath1 must have a `` slice '' with @xmath91-dimensional volume larger than @xmath92 .",
    "it is needed to take advantage of an argument of white @xcite , where regularity is a key ingredient .",
    "the following local minimality property could replace strict stability and smoothness :    * for each @xmath93 there is a @xmath94 such that any current @xmath61 with boundary @xmath3 which is distinct from @xmath95 and at flat distance smaller than @xmath96 from @xmath95 has mass strictly larger than that of @xmath95 .",
    "the corollaries [ c : main1 ] and [ c : main2 ] will be shown in the very last section of the paper ( cf .",
    "section [ s : final ] ) .",
    "the remaining part will instead be entirely devoted to prove theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "first of all in the section [ s : pull - tight ] we will introduce two adapted classes of stationary varifolds for the constrained and unconstrained case , which are a simple variants of the usual notion of stationary varifold introduced by almgren . then in proposition",
    "[ p : pull - tight ] we prove the existence of a suitable sequence of families @xmath97 in @xmath51 with the property that each min - max sequence generated by it converges to a stationary varifold : the argument is a straightforward adaptation of almgren s pull - tight procedure used in pitts book and in several other later references ( indeed we follow the presentation in @xcite ) ) .    in the sections [ s : am ] and [ s : comb ]",
    "we adapt the notion of almost minimizing surfaces used in @xcite to the case at the boundary and we ultimately prove the existence of a min - max sequence which is almost minimizing in any sufficiently small annulus centered at any given point , cf . proposition [ a.m. in annuli ] .",
    "the arguments follow closely those used by pitts in @xcite and a trick introduced in @xcite to avoid pitts discretized families .",
    "the min - max sequence generated in proposition [ a.m. in annuli ] is the one for which we will conclude the properties claimed in theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "indeed the interior regularity follows from the arguments of pitts ( with a suitable adaptation by schoen and simon to the case @xmath98 ) and we refer to @xcite for the details .",
    "the remaining sections are thus devoted to the boundary regularity .",
    "first of all in section [ s : boundary ] we collect several tools about the boundary behavior of stationary varifolds ( such as the monotonicity formulae in both the constrained and uncostrained case and a useful maximum principle in the constrained one ) , but more importantly , we will use a very recent argument of white to conclude suitable curvature estimates at the boundary in the constrained case , under the assumption that the minimal surface meets @xmath13 transversally in a suitable ( quantified ) sense , cf .",
    "theorem [ t : boundary_est ] .",
    "in section [ s : stability ] we recall the celebrated schoen - simon compactness theorem for stable minimal hypersurfaces in the interior and its variant by grter and jost in the free boundary case .",
    "moreover , we combine the schoen - simon theorem with theorem [ t : boundary_est ] to conclude a version of the schoen - simon compactness theorem for stable hypersurfaces up to the boundary , when the latter is a fixed given smooth @xmath3 and the surfaces meet @xmath13 transversally . in section [ s : replacements ] we modify the proof in @xcite to construct replacements for almost minimizing varifolds .",
    "the main difficulty and contribution here is to preserve the boundary conditions for the surfaces in the constrained case , throughout the various steps of the construction . following the arguments in @xcite",
    ", we analogously define the @xmath99 - homotopic platau problem for @xmath100 , and we conclude that in sufficiently small balls , the corresponding minimizers are actually minimizing for the ( usual ) plateau problem . hence their regularity ( with no singular points ! ) at the boundary will follow from allard s boundary regularity in @xcite .",
    "finally the tools of section [ s : stability ] and section [ s : replacements ] are used in section [ s : bdry_reg ] to conclude the boundary regularity of the minmax surface and hence complete the proof of theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "since we are always dealing with manifolds @xmath15 which have a nonempty boundary , as it is customary an open subset @xmath36 of @xmath15 can contain a portion of @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath15 is the closed unit ball in @xmath101 , @xmath102 the north pole @xmath103 and @xmath104 a neighborhood of @xmath102 in @xmath101 , then @xmath105 is , in the relative topology , an open subset of @xmath15 . hence , although we will denote by @xmath106 the set @xmath107 , the latter _ is not _ the topological interior of @xmath15 and our notation is slightly abusive . in the following table we present notations , definitions and conventions used consistently throughout the paper : +    [ cols= \"",
    "< , < \" , ]     note that all of the different spaces of vector fields introduced above ( namely @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) coincide when @xmath112 .",
    "otherwise we have the inclusions @xmath113 which are all proper .",
    "additional clarifications on the differences are provided in the next section . for the notation and terminology about currents and rectifiable varifolds we will follow @xcite .",
    "however we warn the reader that , unless we specify that a given varifold is integer rectifiable , in general it will be not and will be understood as a suitable measure on the space of grassmanians , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 8) .",
    "the first step in the min - max construction consists of finding a _ nice _ minimizing sequence having the property that _ any _ min - max sequence belonging to it converges to a stationary varifold . from now on we will denote the subset of stationary varifolds by @xmath114 ( or simply @xmath115 ) : the latter is the space of varifolds @xmath116 such that @xmath117 for any vector field @xmath118 , where @xmath119 denotes , as usual , the first variation of @xmath116 ( we refer to @xcite for the relevant definition ) .",
    "we will however consider two slightly smaller subclasses of @xmath115 , depending on whether we are dealing with the constrained or unconstrained problem . to get an intuition consider the one - parameter families of smooth maps @xmath120 generated by vector fields in @xmath121 following their flows and observe first that such family of smooth maps are keep fix any point @xmath122 . concerning the points in @xmath36 ( more precisely those in @xmath123 ) , we have the following different behaviors :    * if @xmath124 then , for every @xmath125 , @xmath120 is a diffeomorphism of @xmath15 onto itself which is the identity on @xmath13 ; * if @xmath126 then , for every @xmath125 , @xmath120 is a diffeomorphism of @xmath15 onto itself which maps @xmath127 _ onto _ itself ; * if @xmath128 then @xmath120 is a well - defined map for @xmath129 , but not necessarily for @xmath130 ; moreover , for each @xmath129 , @xmath120 is a diffeomorphism of @xmath15 with @xmath131 , but in general @xmath132 will be a proper subset of @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath120 rather than mapping @xmath13 into itself might `` push it inwards '' .",
    "it is thus clear that @xmath133 is a natural class of variations for the uncostrained problem , whereas a vector field in @xmath134 gives a natural ( one - sided ) variation for the constrained problem if we impose that it vanishes on the fixed boundary @xmath3 .",
    "this motivates the following    [ d : vairations ] in the `` constrained '' min - max problem , where the boundary constraint is @xmath3 , we introduce the set @xmath135 ( or shortly @xmath136 ) which consists of those varifolds satisfying the condition @xmath137 in the `` unconstrained '' min - max problem we introduce the set @xmath138 which consists of those varifolds which are stationary for all variations in @xmath139 : @xmath140    clearly , since @xmath141 , @xmath138 is a subset of the stationary varifolds @xmath115 .",
    "note moreover that , if @xmath142 , then both @xmath143 and @xmath144 belong to @xmath145 : therefore we again conclude @xmath146 .    for the purpose of this section",
    ", we will consider the subset @xmath147 of varifolds with mass bounded by @xmath148 ( the latter being the minmax value of theorem [ t : main ] ) . recall that the weak * topology on this set is metrizable , and we choose a metric @xmath149 which induces it .",
    "we are now ready to state the main technical proposition of this section which , as already mentioned , will be proved using the classical pull - tight procedure of almgren .",
    "[ p : pull - tight ] let @xmath51 be a homotopically closed set of smooth families parametrized , such that is satisfied .",
