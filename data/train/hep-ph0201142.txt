    "in hydrodynamic models @xcite the freeze - out surface is very sensitive on the initial conditions and is therefore highly model dependent , ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : jaipur2_fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , this dependence disappears when considering ratios of integrated particle yields , @xmath0 , which are independent of the details of the initial conditions and are the same as those of point - like particles in a fireball at rest , @xmath1 @xcite . if the rapidity distribution is flat ( as is the case at rhic energies ) then it is furthermore possible to show that @xmath2 the conditions for the validity of these results have been discussed in the literature @xcite and will not be repeated here . motivated by the above results , a systematic study of fully integrated particle multiplicities in central au  au and pb  pb collisions at beam momenta of 1.7@xmath3 gev , 11.6@xmath3 gev ( au  au ) and 158@xmath3 gev ( pb  pb ) has been performed @xcite .",
    "the close similarity of the colliding systems makes it possible to study heavy ion collisions under definite initial conditions over a wide range of beam energies .",
    "it can be concluded that a thermal model description of particle multiplicities , with additional strangeness suppression , is possible for each energy .",
    "the resulting temperature @xmath4 and chemical potential @xmath5 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig2 ] which also shows results from recent fits to the rhic data @xcite it can been seen that , at all energies , the average energy per hadron in the comoving frame is always close to 1 gev per hadron despite the fact that the center - of - mass energy varies more than 100-fold @xcite : @xmath6 it should be noted that , with the advent of more precise data from the na49 collaboration , this relation is now better satisfied than when it was first proposed in 1998 @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the baryon chemical potential , @xmath5 , can be described by a simple fit @xcite @xmath7 with @xmath8 gev and @xmath9 gev .",
    "the temperature is then determined from eq .",
    "[ eqn : eovern ] .",
    "the resulting fits to @xmath10 and @xmath11 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmu ] .",
    "this parametrisation can be used to discuss the energy dependence of particle ratios .",
    "the temperature varies considerably between the lowest and the highest beam energies , namely , between 50 mev at sis and 160 mev at sps .",
    "similarly , the baryon chemical potential changes appreciably , decreasing from about 820 mev at sis to about 240 mev at sps . the supplementary @xmath12factor @xcite , measuring the deviation from a completely equilibrated hadron gas , is around 0.7  0.8 at all energies where it has been considered as a free fit parameter . at the present level of accuracy , a fully equilibrated hadron gas ( i.e. @xmath12=1 ) can not be ruled out in all examined collisions except in pb ",
    "pb , where @xmath12deviates from 1 by more than @xmath13",
    ". this result does not agree with a recent similar analysis of pb ",
    "pb data @xcite imposing full strangeness equilibrium .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is to be found in the different data set used ; whilst in ref .",
    "@xcite measurements in different limited rapidity intervals have been collected , we have used only particle yields extrapolated to full phase space .",
    "the temperature values that we have found essentially agree with previous analyses in au ",
    "au collisions @xcite and estimates at 11.7 @xmath3 gev @xcite .",
    "the results of the previous section combined with the energy dependence of the thermal parameters shown in fig .  [ fig : tmu ] provide a basis for the study of the energy dependence of strangeness production in heavy ion collisions . of particular interest",
    "are the ratios of strange to non - strange particle multiplicities as well as the relative strangeness content of the system as expressed by the wroblewski factor @xcite defined as : @xmath14 furthermore , we assume ( for simplicity ) strangeness to be in complete equilibrium , that is , the strangeness saturation factor is taken as @xmath12=1 .",
    "when more data will become available , this point can be refined .",
    "we turn our attention first to the energy dependence of the wroblewski ratio the quark content used in this ratio is determined at the moment of chemical freeze - out , i.e. from the hadrons and especially , hadronic resonances , before they decay .",
    "this ratio is thus not an easily measurable observable unless one can reconstruct all resonances from the final - state particles .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig4 ] as a function of invariant energy @xmath15 .",
    "the values calculated from the experimental data at chemical freeze - out in central a - a collisions have been taken from reference  @xcite . there",
    "the statistical model was fitted with the extra parameter @xmath16 to account for the possible chemical under - saturation of strangeness . in general , values for @xmath16 close to 1 are found . at the sps , @xmath17 gives the best agreement with 4@xmath18 data .",
    "this is also the reason why the sps points in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig4 ] lie below the solid line .",
    "the values of @xmath19 were extracted from 4@xmath18 integrated data with the exception of the result form rhic where particle ratios were measured only at mid - rapidity @xcite .",
    "the solid line in fig .  [ fig : jaipur2_fig4 ] describes the statistical model calculations in complete equilibrium along the unified freeze - out curve  @xcite and with the energy dependent thermal parameters presented here . from fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig4 ] we conclude that around 30 a@xmath20gev lab energy the relative strangeness content in heavy ion collisions reaches a clear and well pronounced maximum .",
    "the wroblewski factor decreases towards higher incident energies and reaches a value of about 0.43 .",
    "the appearance of the maximum can be traced to the specific dependence of @xmath5 on the beam energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig4 ] we also show the results for @xmath19 calculated under the assumption that only the temperature varies with collision energy but the baryon chemical potential is kept fixed at zero . in this case",
    "the wroblewski factor is indeed seen to be a monotonic function of energy .",
    "the assumption of vanishing net baryon density is of course the prevailing situation in e.g. p-@xmath21 and e@xmath22-e@xmath23 collisions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig4 ] the results for @xmath19 extracted from the data in p - p , p-@xmath24 and e@xmath22-e@xmath23 are also included  @xcite .",
    "the dashed line represents results with @xmath25 and a radius of 1.2 fm .",
    "there are two important differences in the behavior of @xmath19 in elementary compared to heavy ion collisions .",
    "firstly , the strangeness content is smaller by a factor of two . in elementary collisions particle multiplicities",
    "follow the values given by the canonical ensemble with radius 1.2 fm whereas in a - a collisions there is a transition from canonical to grand canonical behavior .",
    "secondly , there is no significant maximum in the behavior of @xmath19 in elementary collisions due to the zero baryon density in the p-@xmath21 and e@xmath22-e@xmath23 systems .    following the chemical freeze - out curve , shown as a thick full line in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig4 ] , one can see that @xmath19 rises quickly from sis to ags energies , then reaches a maximum around @xmath26 mev and @xmath27 mev .",
    "these freeze - out parameters correspond to 30 gev lab energy . at higher incident energies",
    "the increase in @xmath4 becomes negligible but @xmath5 keeps on decreasing and as a consequence @xmath19 also decreases .",
    "the importance of finite baryon density on the behavior of @xmath19 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 showing separately the contributions to @xmath28 coming from strange baryons , from strange mesons and from hidden strangeness , i.e. , from hadrons like @xmath29 and @xmath30 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig5 ] , the origin of the maximum in the wroblewski ratio can be traced to the contribution of strange baryons .",
    "even strange mesons exhibit a broad maximum .",
    "this is due to the presence of associated production of e.g.  kaons together with hyperons .",
    "this channel dominates at low @xmath15 and loses importance at high incident energies .",
    "next we study how the behavior of the wroblewski ratio is reflected in specific particle yields .",
    "the energy dependence of the @xmath31 ratio is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig6 ] .",
    "the model gives a good description of the data , showing a broad maximum at the same energy as the one seen in the wroblewski factor .",
    "the appearance of the maximum in the relative strangeness contribution becomes also obvious when considering ratios which are more sensitive to the baryon chemical potential .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig6 ] also shows the energy dependence of the @xmath32 and the @xmath33 ratios which all exhibit maxima .",
    "the peak in the @xmath31 ratio is much stronger than the one in the @xmath34 or in the @xmath33 ratios .",
    "there is also a shift of the maximum to higher energies for particles with increasing strangeness quantum number .",
    "these differences appear as a consequence of the enhanced strangeness content of the particles which suppresses the dependence of the corresponding ratio on @xmath5 .",
    "we next analyze the centrality dependence of the thermal parameters describing hadron multiplicities @xcite .",
    "this provides further information about the effects of the size of the excited strongly interacting system and help in the systematic understanding of the experimental data .",
    "we will show that the thermal model is able to describe the available data for various centrality classes at one beam energy .    in order to have a sound basis for the application of the thermal model we rely as much as possible on fully integrated particle multiplicities .",
    "for this reason we concentrate our efforts on the analysis of results obtained by the na49 collaboration @xcite using centrality selected fixed - target pb  pb collisions at a beam energy of 158 gev per nucleon , which are here analyzed within the framework of the thermal model .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the inclusion or omission of certain hadron species can change considerably the extracted values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we stress however that our analysis , due to the restricted available data , focuses on the trends with changing centrality .",
    "the temperature , @xmath4 , and the baryon chemical potential , @xmath5 , do not show any noticeable dependence on centrality @xcite .",
    "there are two thermal parameters which exhibit a pronounced dependence on centrality : the strangeness equilibration factor @xmath16 increases approximately linearly and saturates for increasing centrality , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jaipur2_fig7 ] .",
    "other thermodynamic state variables , such as the energy per hadron @xmath35 , the energy density , the baryon density , and the entropy per baryon @xmath36 , remain fairly independent of the centrality .    in summary ,",
    "the analysis of the thermal parameters , describing the integrated yields of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 as obtained by the na49 experiment @xcite shows that the radius of the fireball increases linearly with increasing centrality .",
    "also the strangeness parameter @xmath16 increases , i.e. , strange particle multiplicities approach chemical equilibrium . in contrast , the temperature and the baryon chemical potential do not change with centrality .",
    "no in - medium modifications are needed to describe the above quoted hadron yields .",
