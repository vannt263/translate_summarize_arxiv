    "the discovery of three x - ray transient ultracompact accreting millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , xte j1751 - 305 @xcite , xte j0929 - 314 @xcite , and xte j1807 - 294 @xcite have demonstrated the existence of binary pulsar systems with low mass , @xmath4 , donors .",
    "these three ultracompact systems ( here defined as binaries with orbital periods , @xmath5 min ) are remarkably homogeneous , with measured @xmath6 min respectively , well below the minimum period for a system with a donor composed primarily of hydrogen @xcite . since the nature of the donors in these systems today depends on the prior evolution of the system , it is useful to discuss the potential formation mechanisms for these systems .",
    "binary systems with @xmath7 min can form through at least two channels .",
    "stable mass transfer from an evolved main - sequence star @xcite or a he burning star @xcite onto a neutron star ( ns ) is one mechanism . in this scenario ,",
    "the main - sequence star is brought into roche lobe contact due to orbital angular momentum losses from magnetic braking at a time when the core has nearly completed h burning .",
    "such a system will evolve to orbital periods comparable to the ultracompact msps and can reach @xmath8 min @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that the resulting ultracompact binaries have donor masses @xmath9 as they pass through @xmath10 min on their way towards a shorter period .",
    "these masses are significantly greater than those measured in the ultracompact msps @xcite .",
    "however , systems evolving through 40 min on the way out from the period minimum have masses more in line with the measurements ( @xmath11 ) and by this time the donors have become partially degenerate with core temperatures @xmath12 k @xcite .",
    "the second scenario that may form ultracompact systems involves triggering a common envelope phase during an unstable mass transfer episode from the donor onto the ns .",
    "the core of the donor , either a he or c / o white dwarf ( wd ) , and the ns spiral - in to shorter orbital periods until the envelope is expelled @xcite .",
    "several authors have proposed binary evolution scenarios in which the system , after emerging from the common envelope phase , then suffers in - spiral due to gravitational wave ( gw ) emission and eventually re - establishes contact @xcite . during this long gw in - spiral , the wd will have had time to cool , setting the entropy of the donor at the onset of the second mass transfer phase @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that a large fraction of the ns - wd binaries that undergo a common envelope phase will reach contact within 1 gyr .",
    "even considering a longer 4 gyr delay between the formation of the wd secondary and the onset of mass transfer , a he wd will have @xmath13 k @xcite , while a c / o wd will have @xmath14 k @xcite .",
    "the mass transfer time - scale at contact is much shorter than the wd cooling time - scale for these wds so that the initial entropy of these objects is the minimum attainable . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "if these objects adiabatically expand under mass loss , their @xmath3 will have been reduced by a factor of @xmath15 by the time they have reached @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to the evolutionary arguments that donors in the ultracompact msps have not reached a @xmath16 configuration , the system xte j1751 - 305 provides observational evidence for a hot donor since , as noted by @xcite , a fully degenerate companion composed of he or c can not fill its roche lobe ( rl ) in this system .",
    "hence , in examining the donors in the ultracompact accreting msps , we need to consider them to be arbitrarily degenerate , low mass objects of evolved ( he or c / o ) composition . to further constrain the nature of these donors ( for example , their @xmath3 ) requires knowledge of their mass - radius , @xmath0-@xmath1 , relation . for the compositions ( he , c / o ) , mass ( @xmath17 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath18 k ) ranges of relevance to these objects , the corresponding central densities , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are such that coulomb and thermal contributions to the equation of state ( eos ) provide non - negligible corrections to the degenerate electron pressure , impacting their @xmath0-@xmath1 relations . in this paper",
    ", we detail the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for low - mass stellar objects of finite @xmath3 , extending the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of @xcite for @xmath16 objects . in particular , we make clear that there is a _ continuous connection _ between fully degenerate objects ( i.e. wds ) , fully convective low - mass stars ( i.e. @xmath21 polytropes ) , and coulomb dominated objects .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : toymod ] by constructing a simple model of these objects using an approximate eos .",
    "although crude , this model describes adequately the relevant physics and yields an analytic description of the qualitative behavior of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations and how they are affected by coulomb and thermal contributions to the eos .",
    "we find that at finite @xmath3 , arbitrarily degenerate sequences exhibit a two branch solution , a fact noted previously [ e.g.,@xcite ] .",
    "further , for sufficiently high @xmath3 , the sequence of solutions on these two branches exhibit a mutual end point at a _ non - zero mass _ , @xmath22 , below which equilibrium solutions do not exist .",
    "when coulomb contributions are small and electrons are non - relativistic , fully convective stellar models of arbitrary degeneracy are well represented by @xmath21 polytropes @xcite . in  [ sec : polytropes ] , we review the role played by degeneracy in determining the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for @xmath21 polytropes and the existence of a two branch solution for the polytrope @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "other authors have noted that for a given @xmath0 , there is a maximum @xmath3 that such polytrope models may have @xcite .",
    "we connect the existence of a maximum @xmath3 with that of @xmath22 . in ",
    "[ sec : adiabats ] , we construct realistic @xmath0-@xmath1 relations using an eos for fully ionized plasmas . there",
    "we exhibit explicitly the impact of coulomb physics on the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations . like the simplified and polytrope models , we find that the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations of this model exhibit a two branch solution and a non - zero @xmath22 at high @xmath3 .",
    "in  [ sec : binapps ] we apply our stellar models to the ultracompact msp systems .",
    "for each of these systems , there is a donor ( of some composition and @xmath3 ) which will fill the rl at the required @xmath23 for any given orbital inclination . and , for a given composition , there is , in each system , a relation between orbital inclination and @xmath3 .",
    "we examine what constraints this places on the composition and @xmath3 of the donors in these systems .",
    "for example , in xte j1807 - 294 , c and he donors can have any @xmath3 , while an o donor s @xmath3 has a minimum value . in xte j1751 - 305 , all he or c / o donors must be hot .",
    "we also examine how the future evolution of these systems depends on donor composition and @xmath3 and highlight the fact that a multiple - valued @xmath0-@xmath1 relation leads to a multiple - valued relation between @xmath23 and the system s mass transfer rate , @xmath24 . finally ,",
    "in the context of adiabatic evolution , we discuss the expected number distribution of ultracompact systems as a function of @xmath23 . in a steady state",
    ", this distribution depends almost solely on the response of the donor radius , @xmath25 , to mass loss through the quantity @xmath26 .",
    "the increased importance of coulomb physics in c / o donors alters @xmath27 as compared to he donors and the expected distribution for the two donor types differs dramatically .",
    "depending on donor type , the relative number of systems at @xmath10 min as compared to those at @xmath8 min is @xmath28 for he donors and @xmath29 for c / o donors .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conc ] by discussing future applications of and refinements to our models .",
    "in the mass range of interest ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath0-@xmath1 relations for various objects have previously been constructed . for h",
    "rich objects , @xcite summarize the work that has been done on the structure and evolution of brown dwarfs and related objects . for these objects ,",
    "the models include detailed treatment of the equation of state ( eos ) and atmospheric physics . on the other hand , for objects with more evolved composition ( i.e. he or c / o )",
    "the theory is not so mature .",
    "@xcite calculated the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations for @xmath16 objects using the eos they derived from the thomas - fermi - dirac equation @xcite .",
    "this eos treats in an approximate manner the corrections due to coulomb interactions and exchange effects in a fully - degenerate plasma .",
    "additional @xmath0-@xmath1 relations produced by several different @xmath16 eos are presented in @xcite , but do not differ appreciably from the @xcite results . for the partially degenerate case",
    ", there is a large body of literature for he and c / o core wds more massive than @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "but , only recently have @xmath0-@xmath1 relations for arbitrarily degenerate he and c / o wds with masses @xmath32 been calculated @xcite and only for a limited number of cases . here",
    "we fill this gap by constructing low - mass wd models utilizing a realistic eos .",
    "degenerate stellar objects with @xmath33 have central densities , @xmath34@xmath35 . in this density range",
    ", the relative energy contributions to the plasma from an ideal fermi gas and coulomb interactions can be comparable .",
    "also , for these densities , at a temperature @xmath36 k , the thermal contributions to the pressure are about 10% of those of the electrons . at lower densities , coulomb and thermal effects",
    "become even more significant in calculating the eos . to examine the interplay between these contributions and how they impact the structure of low - mass stars , we start with a simple eos for a plasma composed of ions with charge number @xmath37 and atomic mass number @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pressure of a fully degenerate non - interacting fermi gas of electrons @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the pressure of an ideal gas of ions and electrons , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the negative pressure contribution due to coulomb interactions in the wigner - seitz approximation , @xmath45 . here",

    "consider a one - zone stellar model , i.e. a spherical system characterized by a single pressure and density , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . from dimensional analysis , @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are",
    "the mass and radius of the star and @xmath55 is the newtonian constant of gravitation . with the pressure given by equation ( [ eq : psimp ] ) , @xmath56 in the @xmath57 limit",
    ", the term involving @xmath58 vanishes and solving for @xmath1 gives @xmath59 showing that the gravitational and coulomb attraction act to collapse the star , which is supported by the degenerate electron pressure . as @xmath60 ,",
    "coulomb forces dominate gravity and @xmath61 . as @xmath62 , coulomb forces become negligible and @xmath63 .",
    "the transition from gravitational to coulomb dominated regime occurs where @xmath64 .",
    "the relation @xmath61 in the low @xmath0 limit implies a constant density , @xmath65 , fixed by the balance between the electron pressure and coulomb attraction . exhibiting @xmath52 explicitly as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    for @xmath68 ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : mrsmast ] ) has solutions given by @xmath69    figure [ fig : mrsimp ] exhibits several isotherms of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation of equation ( [ eq : mrsimp ] ) .",
    "the two - branch nature of this relation is apparent , as is the clear separation into three classes of stellar objects .",
    "the large @xmath0 lower - branch is made up of gravitationally bound objects supported by degeneracy pressure .",
    "on the lower - branch at small @xmath0 , we have coulomb dominated objects .",
    "the upper branch consists of objects supported by thermal pressure .    for @xmath68",
    ", there exists a minimum mass , @xmath22 , found by setting the discriminant in equation ( [ eq : mrsimp ] ) to zero , @xmath70 this expression is only positive if @xmath71 k. for he(c ) this temperature is @xmath72 k. above this critical temperature , the two branches meet at a mutual end point and no solution with @xmath73 exists .",
    "when coulomb physics is negligible , @xmath74 occurs at the point where @xmath75 along the solution curve .",
    "the existence of @xmath22 results from the fact that for @xmath76 , the pressure provided by @xmath77 at any @xmath52 is greater than that needed to support the star ( this is not the case for either an ideal gas or a fermi gas independent of the other  in either of these cases it is well known that equilibrium solutions down to @xmath78 exist ) . alternately , for a given @xmath0 , the isotherm on which @xmath79 gives the maximum @xmath80 for which solutions exist with this mass .",
    "for an object starting out on an upper branch solution , e.g. a recently expired star , as it loses entropy via radiation , it contracts . for a fixed mass ,",
    "a star supported by thermal pressure has @xmath81 , and it heats up , as expected .",
    "the thermal pressure in this case goes as @xmath82 , but @xmath83 and eventually @xmath40 dominates , halting substantial contraction .",
    "further entropy loss leads to a reduction in @xmath80 . for a given @xmath80 and @xmath0 ,",
    "the two possible solutions are physically distinguished by their entropy .      ignoring non - ideal effects and assuming that the electrons are non - relativistic",
    ", a fully convective object has an eos obeying @xmath84 and is modeled by an @xmath21 polytrope .",
    "the specific entropy , @xmath85 , throughout such a model is a constant . as @xmath85 only depends on the degeneracy parameter @xmath86 , defined as the ratio of the chemical potential of the electrons to @xmath87 ( @xmath88 being the boltzmann constant ) , @xmath86 is also a constant of the model @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , this allows us to write the pressure of a non - interacting gas of electrons and ions as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the mass of a proton and @xmath91 is defined as @xmath92 thus varying as @xmath86 changes . here",
    "@xmath93 is the ion mean molecular weight and @xmath94 is the fermi - dirac function of order @xmath88 from @xcite .",
    "we then utilize the @xmath21 polytrope relations , equation ( [ eq : polyp ] ) , and the fact that @xmath95 to determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of @xmath86 , @xmath3 .",

    "just as in the simple models of  [ sec : toymod ] , this shows explicitly the connection between a maximum @xmath3 for a given @xmath0 and the existence of an @xmath22 for a fixed @xmath3 . here again",
    ", there are 2 equilibrium radii for a given @xmath0 and @xmath3 differentiated by their degree of degeneracy or equivalently their entropy .",
    "the transition from a thermal pressure dominated to degeneracy pressure dominated state in these models approximately determines @xmath22 .",
    "this transition occurs near where @xmath99 @xmath100 . for increasing @xmath93 ,",
    "this occurs at lower @xmath86 , i.e. at lower @xmath19 if @xmath47 and @xmath3 are held fixed . with @xmath84 , dimensional analysis shows @xmath101 ; a lower density at the transition between degenerate and non - degenerate states gives a smaller @xmath22 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath3 , a pure c wd will has a smaller @xmath22 than a pure he wd .",
    "we now calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations derived from stellar models that include coulomb physics . in these calculations , we assume that the interior profile of our stellar models are adiabatic . in reality , the actual entropy profile in a given donor will depend on its evolutionary history . many factors  such as whether the system formed through a stable or unstable mass transfer channel , whether or not h burning is still ongoing at the point of contact , and how the mass transfer rate changes with time can impact either the initial entropy profile of the donor or its subsequent evolution . in calculating models for donors in ultracompact binaries , without choosing their evolutionary history , a reasonable approximation of their internal entropy profile is the best that can be done . since we aim to construct models that will enable analysis of the donor s properties today , irrespective of their past histories , we must assume some internal profile in calculating them .    a system that initiates mass transfer at a @xmath102 min has a donor mass @xmath103 .",
    "the mass transfer time - scale for such a system with a ns primary is roughly @xmath104 myr , depending on @xmath105 .",
    "consideration of the flux through the half - mass point in our models due to electron conduction ( calculated using the conductive opacities of @xcite ) compared to the heat content of the interior half of the model shows roughly that the time required to transport this heat out of the interior is @xmath106 myr-1 gyr , again depending on @xmath105 .",
    "thus during the mass transfer episode that would lead up to the creation of systems at @xmath10 min , the internal evolution is to first order an adiabatic expansion and , in the absence of tidal heating , the initial entropy profile should be more or less preserved with some corrections due to heat transport . to what ever degree",
    "this occurs , the critical point is that the interior will not be able to maintain an isothermal profile .",
    "we chose to use an adiabatic profile , instead of another arbitrary choice , since it provides several convenient features ",
    "it is a limiting case for the possible thermal profiles of the donor and produces the most compact configuration for a given @xmath3 and @xmath105 , it is completely determined by the utilized eos , and it allows parameterization of a set of models by one quantity , the specific entropy which is constant throughout the model .",
    "in addition , the calculations of @xcite show that he donors tend to become adiabatic as they lose mass .",
    "these latter calculations also highlight that throughout the mass loss episode , donors remain far from isothermal except in the deep interior of the star , and then only at masses near 0.1 @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "for the equation of state , we use the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their work provides accurate prescriptions for calculating the eos for a fully ionized plasma in either liquid or solid states and which includes the ideal contributions from non - degenerate ions , degenerate electrons and the non - ideal contributions due to coulomb interactions .",
    "we also include the radiation contribution , a small effect . in the calculations below",
    ", we assume that the plasma is in the solid state when the quantity @xmath108 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath109 is the inter - ion spacing given by @xmath110 , @xmath111 being the number density of ions .",
    "the quantity @xmath112 is a measure of the strength of the ionic coulomb interactions .",
    "we display a set of isotherms for a pure he plasma calculated with this eos in figure [ fig : eos_ad ] with the solid and dotted lines .",
    "the dotted lines indicate regions in parameter space where @xmath80 and @xmath52 are such that the plasma will likely become only partially ionized . in these regimes",
    "this eos is not strictly valid .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ fig : eos_ad ] show representative adiabats for this eos , some of which cross into regions of partial ionization .",
    "since we utilize an adiabatic internal profile in calculating our models in  [ sec : ad : calc ] , in some of these models there can be a point in their outer layers where our eos becomes invalid .",
    "we use our eos in these regimes despite this problem for two reasons .",
    "first , in the models of most interest only the very most outer layers of the models lie in regimes where ionization state transitions become an issue and the calculated @xmath0-@xmath1 relation is not affected .",
    "second , this eos provides a simple method of calculating the eos for various compositions over a wide range of @xmath52 and @xmath80 and this ease of use would be sacrificed by constructing composition specific extensions to the eos .",
    "we will highlight in our results models in which these eos concerns may cause more than a few percent uncertainty in the calculated @xmath0-@xmath1 relations .",
    "we constructed models for arbitrarily degenerate objects by integrating mass conservation and hydrostatic balance while presuming an adiabatic temperature profile .",
    "the calculation of our models proceeds as follows . in the interior , where degeneracy pressure dominates , we integrate @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the adiabatic exponent @xmath115 found from the eos . the density at each integration step is then solved for from @xmath51 and @xmath80 using the eos . at low @xmath52 , where coulomb effects on the pressure become significant , we switch to integrating @xmath116 where @xmath117 is another adiabatic exponent , and solve for @xmath80 at each integration step from @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "each model integration was terminated once the following criteria were met(1 ) between two integration steps in which @xmath51 differed by more than a factor of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 changed by no more than 1 part in @xmath121 , and ( 2 ) the current pressure is such that @xmath122 .",
    "we change the integrated variable because as @xmath123 along an adiabat , @xmath52 becomes very insensitive to @xmath51 and it is numerically intractable to determine @xmath52 by root finding from @xmath51 and @xmath80 . on the other hand , in the low @xmath51 limit , determining @xmath80 accurately from @xmath51 and @xmath52 is possible , something that was not true in the highly degenerate regime .",
    "we switch from integrating @xmath80 to integrating @xmath52 when a rough measure of the degeneracy , @xmath124 , is satisfied ( where @xmath52 and @xmath80 are in cgs units ) . in the solid state ,",
    "when @xmath125 , @xmath126 due to the rapid decline in the plasma s specific heat once crystalline .",
    "we use an adaptive step - size explicit runge - kutta algorithm to integrate our equations with the step size chosen to maintain a fixed fractional accuracy . a dramatic increase in @xmath114",
    "causes a sharp decline in the speed of the integration as the algorithm tries to maintain this accuracy in all three integrated quantities , @xmath119 , @xmath51 , and @xmath80 . to deal with this problem ,",
    "once @xmath127 k , we set @xmath128 .",
    "this causes no issues in the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations because by this point we are already well in the @xmath129 limit as far as the @xmath51-@xmath52 relation is concerned in any of our models .    finally in these models",
    "the ion coupling parameter , @xmath112 , increases with @xmath120 .",
    "this is due to the fact that along an adiabat , @xmath130 varies from @xmath131 to @xmath132 in a coulomb plasma . since @xmath133 , and @xmath134",
    ", @xmath112 goes as @xmath52 to a negative power .",
    "this is not just true for adiabatic profiles  any object with a profile @xmath135 for @xmath136 will have @xmath112 increasing with @xmath120 ( assuming @xmath37 is fixed)because of this some models transition from liquid to solid in their outer layers . for these cases we do not attempt to match adiabats in the solid and liquid phase (",
    "i.e. we do not account for the latent heat ) .",
    "instead , the integration assumes continuity of @xmath51 and @xmath80 ; the entropy in these models have a small discontinuity .",
    "if crystallization of the object were to actually occur from the surface inward , this could have significant impact on the mass loss rate , since the primary s gravitational field would have to overcome the coulomb binding of the crystal to effect mass transfer .",
    "more realistic calculations are obviously needed to consider this further and consideration of this potential effect in evolutionary calculations are encouraged .",
    "typical results for our model calculations are shown in figures [ fig : polycomp ] and [ fig : headmr ] .",
    "figure [ fig : polycomp ] shows for pure he models how the results utilizing the eos of  [ sec : ad : eos ] differ from the polytropes that neglect coulomb physics . in this , and in figure [ fig : headmr ] , portions of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves shown in dotted lines indicate models where more than 5% of the mass lies in regions where our eos is not strictly valid .",
    "the impact of coulomb interactions on the structure of low mass wds is clear from the comparison of the he polytrope models ( short dashed lines ) to the realistic eos he models ( solid lines ) .",

    "again , the dotted portions of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relations indicate models in which more than 5% of the model s mass lies in a regime where the eos is not strictly valid . from figures [ fig : polycomp ] and [ fig :",
    "headmr ] , it is clear that the realistic treatment of coulomb physics in the eos is necessary to calculate accurately the structure of low mass wds .",

    "the rate at which the orbit evolves will vary accordingly as will the @xmath154 relation over the course of the evolution . to illustrate this , we calculated the forward evolution of xte j0929 - 304 assuming a he donor and four different @xmath144 values .",
    "we assumed that the ns has @xmath155 ( and ignore the change in @xmath148 due to accretion ) and set @xmath156 so that the donor evolves adiabatically , ignoring any heating mechanisms ( such as irradiation or tidal heating ) and cooling .",
    "we show the results in figure [ fig : hej0929 t ] , displaying @xmath105 and @xmath24 as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "these relations are not single valued , but parameterized by orbital inclination , or equivalently , by the donor s entropy .",
    "a smaller @xmath144 requires a more massive donor ( which must be hotter than a lower mass donor if it is to have the fixed mean density implied by the system s @xmath23 ; see also figure [ fig : mtsini ] ) .",
    "this gives a higher @xmath24 for a fixed @xmath23 , as seen in figure [ fig : hej0929",
    "this also impacts the rate at which the orbit evolves . in figure",
    "[ fig : hej0929 t ] , the age of the system from today is indicated along each curve by symbols and it can be seen that the smaller @xmath144 the faster the system will evolve in @xmath23 .    at a given orbital inclination in a specified system , a c / o donor must have a higher @xmath3 to fills the roche lobe than a he donor .",
    "this is due to the stronger coulomb physics in the c / o object , which also causes @xmath157 to differ between the donor types and impacts the binary s evolution .",
    "the difference in @xmath157 between composition is shown in figure [ fig : nad ] for two representative adiabatic tracks for each composition .",
    "the solid dots show the zapolsky - salpeter @xmath27 for the same compositions .",
    "the effect of different @xmath157 on orbital evolution is evident in figure [ fig : aj0929 t ] , which compares the evolution of xte j0929 - 304 for @xmath158 and he , c , and o donors .",
    "the difference in the tracks comes about due to the difference in @xmath157 due to composition ; higher @xmath37 donors evolve fastest in mass , but slowest in @xmath23 because they remain more dense than lower @xmath37 donors at a given mass .",
    "these evolution calculations highlight the dependence of observables ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) on the donor s entropy and composition .",
    "we now emphasize the impact of the donor composition on the ultracompact population , especially the resulting orbital period distribution . in the scenario of cooling wds reaching contact via in - spiral ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the relative number of he vs c / o wd s that come into contact and stably reach longer orbital periods is hard to know .",
    "however , what we will show here is the ability to constrain the relative populations of say , he donors , at one orbital period versus another .",
    "a more complete picture of this dependence is shown in figure [ fig : ns_ucsys ] , where we display for he ( solid lines ) , c ( dashed lines ) , and o ( dash - dot lines ) donors , the @xmath24-@xmath23 relation along @xmath0-@xmath1 isotherms with @xmath159 , and @xmath160 k , assuming @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "these are instantaneous @xmath24 along an adiabatic track at a given @xmath23 and @xmath3 .",
    "one can see immediately that for a given @xmath23 , @xmath24 can constrain the combination of donor @xmath3 and composition .",
    "in particular , a sufficiently strong upper limit on @xmath24 can _ rule out _ a he donor for a given @xmath23 . above the minimum @xmath24 for a he donor , further information about the donor composition",
    "is difficult to infer without constraints on @xmath3 .",
    "now consider adiabatic evolution with initial @xmath163 and donors of varying composition and @xmath3 which fill their rl at @xmath164 min .",
    "we evolve these systems assuming the donor responds adiabatically to mass loss .",
    "the resulting tracks in the @xmath24-@xmath23 diagram are shown in figure [ fig : adiabmdotp ] , along with the measured periods of the known ultracompact binaries with a ns primary ( vertical dotted lines ) and the critical @xmath24 below which the accretion disk in these systems is subject to thermal instabilities for both irradiated ( hatched region , @xcite ) and non - irradiated disks ( nearly horizontal lines , @xcite ) . as compared with figure [ fig : ns_ucsys ] , it can be seen that for systems at @xmath165 min to have _ time - averaged _ mass transfer rates @xmath166 yr@xmath167 , the donor can not have evolved adiabatically from systems coming into contact at @xmath8 min .",
    "there are potentially two examples of such systems : 4u 1626 - 67 ( @xmath168 min and @xmath169 @xcite ) and 4u 1916 - 05 ( @xmath170 min , @xmath171 @xcite ) . if these measured @xmath24s reflect the long - term average @xmath24 , then the donors must be extremely hot ( @xmath172 k , see figure [ fig : ns_ucsys ] ) . however , the typical @xmath24 at these orbital periods are below where a he or c / o disk is thermally stable ( see figure [ fig : adiabmdotp ] ; @xcite ) . in that case",
    "we would explain the present @xmath24 as a higher rate indicative of a system in outburst .",
    "indeed , the luminosity from 4u 1626 - 67 is observed to be in a steady slow decline @xcite .",
    "if the ultracompacts evolve adiabatically , we can determine their relative numbers as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "defining @xmath173 such that @xmath174 is the number of systems with orbital period between @xmath23 and @xmath175 and demanding continuity gives @xmath176 leading to the expected relation between @xmath177 and @xmath178 : @xmath179 where @xmath180 and @xmath181 are the respective quantities at some reference orbital period , @xmath182 .",
    "for @xmath157 fixed , @xmath183 and with @xmath184 , equations ( [ eq : rl ] ) , ( [ eq : pdrel ] ) , and ( [ eq : nofpdot ] ) lead to the simple relation @xmath185 in this case @xmath186 and from this it is clear that _",
    "@xmath157 alone _ determines the number distribution . as @xmath187 increases with @xmath157 , systems with c / o donors will have a stronger increase in @xmath178 with @xmath23 than those with he donors due to the difference in @xmath157 shown in figure [ fig : nad ] . in the more general case",
    ", @xmath157 is variable and equation ( [ eq : dlnndlnp ] ) becomes , up to terms of order @xmath188 , @xmath189 and in general the distribution is almost solely a function of @xmath157 .    while equations ( [ eq : dlnndlnp ] ) and ( [ eq : gen_dlnndlnp ] ) highlight the centrality of @xmath157 in determining @xmath178 , to calculate @xmath178 for each of the adiabats in figure [ fig : adiabmdotp ] it is more straightforward , and slightly more accurate due to the small dependence of @xmath178 on @xmath190 , to calculate @xmath177 numerically and evaluate equation ( [ eq : nofpdot ] ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath177 from @xmath191 where @xmath192 .",
    "we display the resulting @xmath178 distribution for each adiabatic track , normalized to the value of @xmath180 at @xmath193 min , in figure [ fig : dndp ] .",
    "it is clear that the distribution is a strong function of composition , through the differing @xmath194 , but only a weakly depends on the entropy of the donor .",
    "the entropy dependence of @xmath178 derives from the fact that @xmath195 [ equations ( [ eq : rl ] ) , ( [ eq : mdot ] ) , and ( [ eq : pdot ] ) ] and donors with a higher entropy at a fixed mean density have larger @xmath105 ( see figure [ fig : amsprl ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : dndp ] also shows that depending on donor type and entropy , we expect to see roughly 60 - 160 ( for he and c / o donors , respectively ) times as many systems at @xmath196 min than at 10 min .",
    "while consideration of non - adiabatic evolution will change the value of this ratio , the fact that it will be larger for c / o donors than for he donors is expected to be a robust result , regardless of the evolutionary scenario considered .",
    "we have presented models for arbitrarily degenerate stellar objects including coulomb physics with masses @xmath2 . at these low masses , the well known @xmath0-@xmath1 relations for @xmath21 polytropes ( @xmath197 ) , wds ( @xmath63 ) , and coulomb dominated objects ( @xmath61 ) merge and transition from one to another .",
    "the connection between @xmath16 degenerate and coulomb dominated objects has been known from the @xcite @xmath0-@xmath1 relations .",
    "the connection between polytropes and degenerate objects , neglecting coulomb physics , is seen in the @xmath21 polytropes .",
    "our models make the final connection between the three classes of objects , filling in the gap occupied by @xmath198 objects in which coulomb physics can not be neglected .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : models ] , a ubiquitous feature of stellar @xmath0-@xmath1 relations at sufficiently high @xmath3 is the existence of a minimum mass , @xmath22 , below which equilibrium solutions do not exist .",
    "the cause of this is the transition from ideal gas to degenerate electrons providing the pressure support and we showed in  [ sec : polytropes ] that the well known maximum @xmath3 in @xmath21 polytropes for a fixed @xmath0 @xcite is the same physics .",
    "the value of @xmath22 depends on both @xmath3 ( in fact , @xmath199 at sufficiently low @xmath3 ) and the strength of coulomb physics . in general , the lower @xmath3 and the stronger the coulomb interactions , the smaller @xmath22 .",
    "the existence of an @xmath22 may have a profound impact on the evolution of a donor undergoing mass loss .",
    "for our he wds , @xmath200 for models with @xmath201 k. as discussed in @xcite , the existence of an @xmath202 leads to the possibility of disrupting the donor through mass loss .",
    "this could be accomplished through stable mass loss down to @xmath203 or via a mass transfer instability .",
    "the latter will occur if the expansion of the donor under mass loss exceeds that of the rl .",
    "the entropy input needed to cause this instability and the fate of the donor are the subject of future work .",
    "we have applied our model to the accreting ultracompact msps . in xte j1751 - 305 ,",
    "the donor must be hot regardless of its composition ; in xte j0929 - 314 and xte j1807 - 294 , fully degenerate donors are possible , depending on the composition . from orbital inclination constraints ,",
    "the probability that xte j1807 - 294 can accommodate a he donor is 15% while for xte j0929 - 304 , this probability is @xmath141 35% , providing support to the notion that some of these donors are likely c / o wds @xcite .",
    "the evolution of each system will differ depending on the orbital inclination .",
    "in particular , how far the system can evolve in @xmath23 in a specified time and the expected @xmath24-@xmath23 relation depends on @xmath144 through both the mass , core temperature , and composition of the donor .",
    "in general , the @xmath24-@xmath23 relation is additionally parameterized by the donor @xmath3 and composition .",
    "we find that the number distribution of systems as a function of @xmath23 , @xmath173 , is determined by the donor s @xmath27 .",
    "the distribution for systems with c / o donors thus varies significantly from those with he donors . in the case of adiabatic evolution ,",
    "the relative number of systems at 40 min to that at 10 min is @xmath29 for c / o donors and @xmath28 for he donors .",
    "in addition to the accreting msp systems , our models are applicable to the am cvn binary systems , which are believed to be double wd binaries with a he donor @xcite .",
    "the application of our models to these systems is the subject of current work .",
    "the constant entropy models we have calculated give a lower limit on @xmath1 for a given @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and composition .",
    "the actual thermal profile of a donor will depend on its prior evolution : how entropy is deposited into the star , entropy losses , and how quickly heat transport occurs as compared to mass loss . to determine the entropy profile of a donor in a specific system requires consideration of the coupled evolution of the binary and the donor .",
    "while our models do not address this uncertainty , they do provide limiting @xmath0-@xmath1 relations based on the _ total _ entropy content of the model in a consistent and systematic treatment without consideration of past evolution .",
    "as such they will be useful in consideration of binary systems with low - mass wd companions where time evolution of the donor s structure coupled to that of the binary itself is not computationally feasible or necessary .",
    "tracks of our @xmath0-@xmath1 relations and @xmath157 as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath3 for he , c , and o donors are available along with the electronic version of the paper .",
