    "an antiferromagnetic phase is observed in most _ cuprate _ high @xmath4 superconductors . on the other hand antiferromagnetic correlations",
    "are considered to play an important role in the mechanism of pair formation in those materials .",
    "the normal phase of @xmath0 hubbard model has been studied intensively by the composite operator method ( com ) , leading to good agreement with numerical results and experimental data @xcite .",
    "a study of the af phase in the @xmath0 hubbard model by com is therefore supposed to give some insight in both , the nature of antiferromagnetism and the pair forming mechanism .",
    "we investigate the hubbard hamiltonian on a @xmath0 square lattice with additional next ",
    "nearest neighbor hopping @xmath3 @xmath5 by means of com @xcite , using the hubbard operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 as components of the basic spinor @xmath8 .    to describe the af phase we introduce a coarse grained , bipartite lattice with lattice constant @xmath9 , overlaying the chemical lattice by grouping together pairs of nearest neighbors in the usual way . for the two sublattices @xmath10 and @xmath11 we assume a symmetric electronic state , @xmath12 .    the retarded greens functions @xmath13 with @xmath14 in the static approximation where finite life time effects are neglected are determined in a fully self  consistent way by the constraints @xmath15 and @xmath16 , emerging from the algebra of the hubbard operators , namely from the pauli principle .",

    "@xmath21 turns out to be significantly larger then in results obtained by renormalization group techniques @xcite@xcite , which might be due to the fact , that the latter is valid only in the weak coupling limit , whereas com provides a good approximation for intermediate and strong coupling as well .",
    "the band structure shows the opening of a gap at the transition line between the paramagnetic and the af phase .     at @xmath17 , @xmath22 and @xmath18 .",

    "[ fig : m(t ) ] the sublattice magnetization @xmath23 is plotted versus temperature for different values of the coulomb interaction . with decreasing magnetization the energy per site , which is not sublattice dependent because of the above symmetry assumption on the electronic state , is increasing , reaching finally the paramagnetic value at vanishing @xmath24 .",
