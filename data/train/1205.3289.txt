    "<S> ( iii ) @xmath130 ( nn e - h contribution ) is depleted in the vicinity of the so exciton @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing of these modes is natural in view of the nonzero overlap between quasi - degenerate @xmath150 and @xmath151 states [ see fig .  [ fig3](a , b ) ] by virtue of intersite hoppings .    </S>",
    "<S> the pes thus shows that the optically active e - h continuum of @xmath5 band and the optically forbidden so exciton  @xcite are located in the same energy range of @xmath149 ev , and there is considerable mutual interaction between these excitations due to the interband hopping between @xmath5 and @xmath14 states . </S>",

    "<S> the results obtained are consistent with the available experimental data . since the so splitting and the mott - hubbard charge gap are of similar scale , an unusual coupling between two different types of excitations  </S>",
    "<S> the optically inactive so exciton and the optically active e - h continuum  is induced due to the interband mixing of @xmath5 and @xmath14 states . </S>",
    "<S> although this effect is not very essential for nn magnetic interactions , it plays a crucial role in determining the shape of optical spectra : the e - h continuum is suppressed in the vicinity of the so exciton inherent to iridates . </S>",
    "<S> the unusual fano - type coupling between the rich ionic multiplet excitations and electronic continuum seems to be a characteristic feature of @xmath5 mott insulators . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is rooted to the atomic / band duality of 5d electrons and should therefore be generic to iridates with unusual hierarchy of energy scales .    </S>",
