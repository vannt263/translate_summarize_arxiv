    "in galaxy clusters the average morphology of galaxies changes with clustercentric radius or local density .",
    "the central region of clusters at the present epoch is dominated by early - type galaxies .",
    "this is known as the morphology - radius or morphology - density relation ( hereafter mrr and mdr , respectively ) .",
    "since the local density is on average a monotonically decreasing function of clustercentric radius , they appear to convey us the same information @xcite . however , there is discussion about which one plays a critical role in determining the galaxy morphology between the clustercentric radius and the local density @xcite .",
    "there is also a remaining issue what physical parameters of galaxies ( morphology , color , star formation rate , or stellar mass ) correlate fundamentally with the environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain this morphology - environment relation .",
    "it is suggested that tidal interactions between individual galaxies can change mass profile and transform disk galaxies into spheroidals @xcite .",
    "frequency of galaxy - galaxy interaction depends strongly on the clustercentric radius , and thus galaxy interactions can result in the mrr or mdr . however , the duration of tidal interactions and thus the total tidal energy deposit are expected to be too small to change galaxy properties significantly for cluster galaxies that are moving at high speeds . due to the fast orbital motions",
    "the frequency of galaxy mergers is also small in clusters .",
    "a series of frequent high - speed tidal interactions among cluster galaxies , called harassment , can produce impulsive heating and cause morphology transformation @xcite .",
    "tidal interaction with the whole cluster potential well can also change the structure and activity of galaxies significantly @xcite .",
    "existence of the hot x - ray emitted by intracluster gas makes the mechanisms relying on hydrodynamic processes appear attractive . stripping of cold gas from infalling late - type galaxies by a ram pressure of the hot intracluster gas ,",
    "was proposed to explain the increase of the early - type fraction toward the cluster center @xcite .",
    "hot gas removal from infalling galaxies through hydrodynamic interactions with the intracluster medium can shut off gas supply and star formation activity ( sfa ) after the already existing cold gas is consumed .",
    "the interstellar medium of a galaxy traveling in the hot intracluster medium can be stripped from the disk due to a viscosity momentum transfer @xcite or evaporate as the temperature of the interstellar medium rises @xcite .",
    "these hydrodynamic processes have a common drawback that they can turn spirals only to s0 s and do not produce ellipticals .",
    "the major effect of the hydrodynamic processes is quenching the sfa by removing or ionizing the cold gas in the disk of late - type galaxies .",
    "the bulge - to - disk ratio is not expected to increase by these processes .",
    "therefore , none of the mechanisms proposed so far is able to fully account for the mrr or mdr observed in clusters .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have found that galaxy properties like morphology and luminosity depend strongly on the distance and morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy .",
    "this dependence was found even when the large - scale background density is fixed , and thus is completely different from the commonly known morphology - local density relation .",
    "most importantly , the effects of the nearest neighbor change at the characteristic scale given by the virial radius of the neighbor galaxy .",
    "when a galaxy is located within the virial radius of its nearest neighbor , its morphology tends to be the same as that of the neighbor .",
    "but such tendency disappears when the separation is larger than the virial radius .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that galaxies interact hydrodynamically when the separation to their nearest neighbor is smaller than the virial radius of the neighbor , and that the effects of such interaction are significant enough to change their morphology and sfa .",
    "outside the virial radius galaxy morphology still depends on the distance to the nearest neighbor , but is suddenly independent of neighbor s morphology .",
    "the probability for a galaxy to be an early type monotonically decreases as the separation increases .",
    "this strongly supports the idea that the conformity in morphology of galaxy pairs is not primordial but an acquired one through interactions since there should be no reason for the break in morphology conformity to be at the current virial radius of the neighbor if it is initially given .",
    "@xcite proposed that the mechanism responsible for this be tidal interactions causing both gravitational and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "outside the virial radius the interactions are purely gravitational between the galaxy plus dark halo systems , but within the virial radius hydrodynamic ( and radiative ) effects must be involved as well .",
    "a series of tidal interactions and mergers will keep the total cold gas contents in bright galaxies decreasing , producing more early - type galaxies as time passes @xcite .",
    "the speed of this process is an increasing function of the large - scale density .",
    "namely , even though the direct physical processes affecting galaxy morphology are the gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring galaxies , the large - scale background density appears to control galaxy morphology through its statistical correlation with the frequency and strength of galaxy - galaxy interactions . given the knowledge that the mdr in most region of the universe ( note that park et al .",
    "did not resolve the cluster regions ) is the result of galaxy - galaxy interactions , one can naturally suspect the mrr and mdr in clusters are also due to the interactions between individual galaxies .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explore this possibility .",
    "we use a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 6 ( dr6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the survey produced five - band ( _ ugriz _ ) photometric data for 230 million objects over 8,400 deg@xmath1 , and optical spectroscopic data more than one million objects of galaxies , quasars , and stars over 6860 deg@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "extensive description of sdss data products is given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data is supplemented by several value - added galaxy catalogs ( vagcs ) drawn from sdss data .",
    "photometric and structure parameters of galaxies are obtained from the sdss pipeline @xcite .",
    "complementary photometric parameters such as color gradient , concentration index , and petrosian radius are taken from the dr4plus sample of @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters are obtained from mpa / jhu and nyu vagcs @xcite .",
    "-band magnitude ( _ upper panel _ ) and clustercentric radius ( _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "filled circles are the spectroscopic completeness of the data complemented by ned , while open circles show the completeness of the original sdss spectroscopic sample . ]",
    "completeness of the spectroscopic data in sdss is poor for bright galaxies with @xmath2 because of the problems of saturation and cross - talk in the spectrograph , and for the galaxies located in high density regions such as galaxy clusters due to the fiber collision ( two spectroscopic fibers can not be placed closer than @xmath3 on a given plate ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to supplement the galaxy data to reduce the possible effects of the incompleteness problem .",
    "we search for the galaxies within ten times the virial radius of each galaxy cluster in the photometric catalog of the sdss galaxies , and find their redshifts from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) to supplement our spectroscopic sample .",
    "figure [ fig - comp ] shows the spectroscopic completeness of our galaxy sample as a function of apparent magnitude and of clustercentric distance .",
    "the open circles are the completeness of the original sdss sample , and the filled circles are that of our sample with additional redshifts .",
    "it shows that the spectroscopic completeness of our sample is higher than @xmath4 at all magnitudes and clustercentric radii .",
    "we used the abell catalog of galaxy clusters @xcite to identify cluster galaxies in our galaxy sample . among the abell clusters , we selected those that have known spectroscopic redshifts in the ned .",
    "we found @xmath5 clusters located within the sdss survey region .",
    "we adopted the position of cluster center in the ned , but replaced it with the x - ray determined position if it is available in the literature .    in order to determine the membership of galaxies in a cluster",
    ", we used the `` shifting gapper '' method of @xcite that was used for the study of kinematics of galaxy clusters @xcite . in the radial velocity versus clustercentric distance space",
    ", the cluster member galaxies were selected by grouping galaxies with connection lengths of 950 km s@xmath6 in the direction of the radial velocity and of 0.1 @xmath7mpc in the direction of the clustercentric radius @xmath8 .",
    "if the boundary was not reached out to @xmath9mpc , we stopped the grouping at @xmath10mpc .",
    "we iterated the procedure until the number of cluster members converges . from this procedure",
    "we obtained 200 abell clusters that have more than or equal to 10 member galaxies .",
    "we computed a radius of @xmath11 ( usually called the virial radius ) for each cluster where the mean overdensity drops to 200 times the critical density of the universe @xmath12 , using the formula given by @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a velocity dispersion of a cluster and the hubble parameter at @xmath15 is @xmath16 $ ] @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the dimensionless density parameters . the velocity dispersion was computed for each cluster from the redshift distribution of the cluster member galaxies as described in appendix .",
    "in addition to the sample of cluster member galaxies obtained by the `` shifting gapper '' method above , we included the galaxies located at projected separations of @xmath20 to investigate the variation of galaxy properties over a wide range of clustercentric radius .",
    "@xmath21 is the largest clustercentric distance of the cluster member galaxies determined above .",
    "these additional galaxies were constrained to have velocity difference relative to the cluster s systematic velocity less than @xmath22 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the final sample consists of galaxies smoothly distributed from the cluster center to @xmath23 for each cluster .",
    "figure [ fig - member ] shows the radial velocities of galaxies around eight clusters in our sample as a function of clustercentric distance of galaxies .",
    "we rejected the clusters that appeared to be interacting or merging , which was decided in the galaxy velocity versus clustercentric distance space .",
    "dynamically young clusters having the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) at large clustercentric distance ( @xmath24 @xmath7 mpc ) were rejected too .",
    "we also eliminated the clusters for which survey coverages were not complete out to 10@xmath25 .",
    "we finally obtained a sample of 93 relaxed abell clusters and 34,420 associated galaxies for our analysis .",
    "the physical parameters of galaxies that we consider in this study are @xmath26-band absolute petrosian magnitude ( @xmath27 ) , morphology , axis ratio , @xmath28 color , equivalent width of @xmath29 emission line , @xmath30 color gradient , concentration index ( @xmath31 ) , internal velocity dispersion ( @xmath32 ) , and petrosian radius in @xmath33-band . here",
    "we give a brief description of these parameters .",
    "the @xmath26-band absolute magnitude @xmath27 was computed using the formula , @xmath34 - 25-k(z)-e(z),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the comoving distance at redshift @xmath15 in unit of @xmath7mpc , and the corresponding @xmath36 term in @xmath27 will be omitted in this paper .",
    "@xmath37 is the @xmath38-correction , and @xmath39 is the luminosity evolution correction . we adopt a flat @xmath40cdm cosmology with density parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the rest - frame absolute magnitudes of individual galaxies are computed in fixed bandpasses , shifted to @xmath43 , using galactic reddening correction @xcite and @xmath38-corrections as described by @xcite . the evolution correction given by @xcite , @xmath44 ,",
    "is also applied .",
    "figure [ fig - vol ] shows the @xmath26-band absolute magnitudes of the cluster galaxies against their redshifts .",
    "we define the volume - limited samples of galaxies using the redshift and absolute magnitude conditions as follows : c1 ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , c2 ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , and c3 ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "the apparent magnitude limit line ( @xmath51 ) shown in figure [ fig - vol ] is obtained using the mean @xmath38-correction relation given by equation ( 2 ) of @xcite .",
    "accurate morphology classification is critical in this work since the effects of interaction depend strongly on morphology of the target and neighbor galaxies .",
    "we first classify morphological types of galaxies included in the dr4plus sample of @xcite adopting the automated classification method given by @xcite .",
    "galaxies are divided into early ( elliptical and lenticular ) and late ( spiral and irregular ) morphological types based on their locations in the @xmath28 color versus @xmath30 color gradient space and also in the @xmath33-band concentration index space .",
    "the resulting morphological classification has completeness and reliability reaching 90% .",
    "the automatic classification scheme does not perform well when an early - type galaxy starts to overlap with another galaxy .",
    "this is because the scheme excludes galaxies with very low concentration from the early - type class and blended images often erroneously give low concentration .",
    "since we are investigating the effects of close galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - cluster interactions on galaxy properties , this problem in the automatic classification has to be remedied .",
    "we perform an additional visual check of the color images of galaxies to correct misclassifications by the automated scheme . in this procedure",
    "we changed the types of the blended or merging galaxies , blue but elliptical - shaped galaxies , and dusty edge - on spirals .",
    "in addition , for the galaxies in dr6 that are not in the dr4plus sample , we visually classified their morphological types using the color images .",
    "the @xmath52 color was computed using the extinction and @xmath38-corrected model magnitude .",
    "the superscript 0.1 means the rest - frame magnitude @xmath38-corrected to the redshift of 0.1 , and will subsequently be dropped .",
    "we adopt the values of @xmath53 color , concentration index ( @xmath31 ) , and petrosian radius @xmath54 computed for the dr4plus sample of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53 color gradient was defined by the color difference between the region with @xmath55 and the annulus with @xmath56 , where @xmath54 is the petrosian radius estimated in @xmath33-band image . to account for the effect of flattening or inclination of galaxies , elliptical annuli were used to calculate the parameters .",
    "the ( inverse ) concentration index is defined by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are semimajor axis lengths of ellipses containing @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the petrosian flux in the @xmath33-band image , respectively .",
    "the velocity dispersion value of the galaxy is adopted from nyu - vagc @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath29 equivalent width is taken from mpa / jhu - vagc @xcite , which is computed using the straight integration over the fixed bandpass from the continuum - subtracted emission line with the model of @xcite .    in our analysis",
    "we often limit the late - type galaxy sample to galaxies with @xmath33-band isophotal axis ratio @xmath62 greater than 0.6 .",
    "this is to reduce the effects of internal extinction on our results .",
    "the absolute magnitude and color of late - type galaxies with @xmath63 are very inaccurate ( see figs . 5 and 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , including them in the analysis may introduce a large dispersion in sf indicators such as luminosity , color , @xmath29 equivalent width , and color gradient .      to account for the effects of the nearest neighbor galaxy in cluster environment , we determine the distance and the morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy .",
    "we define the nearest neighbor galaxy of a target galaxy with absolute magnitude @xmath27 as the one which is located closest to the galaxy on the sky and is brighter than @xmath64 among those in our cluster galaxy sample .",
    "we adopt @xmath65 .",
    "when we adopt galaxies fainter than the target galaxy by more than 0.5 mag as neighbors , our conclusions do not change but our statistics are worse since the number of target galaxies becomes smaller ( see  [ mer ] for more discussion ) .",
    "we do not use the velocity condition to determine the nearest neighbor galaxy because it is selected from the cluster galaxy sample to which the velocity condition is already applied .",
    "we obtain the nearest neighbor distance normalized by the virial radius of the nearest neighbor as follows .",
    "we first compute the small - scale density experienced by a target galaxy attributed to its neighbor , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the mass - to - light ratio of the neighbor galaxy , @xmath68 is the @xmath26-band luminosity of the neighbor , @xmath69 is the projected separation of the neighbor from the target galaxy , and @xmath70 is the mean density of the universe .",
    "we assume that @xmath71(early)=@xmath72(late ) at the same @xmath26-band luminosity , and that @xmath71 is constant with galaxy luminosity for a given morphological type .",
    "the value of mean density of the universe , @xmath73 , was adopted , where @xmath74 is the mass of a late - type galaxy with @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "then , we define the virial radius of a neighbor galaxy as the projected radius where the mean mass density @xmath76 within the sphere with radius of @xmath69 is 200 times the critical density or 740 times the mean density of the universe , namely , @xmath77 since we adopt @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "this is almost equal to the virialized density @xmath80 in the case of our @xmath40cdm universe @xcite .",
    "this is what @xcite used to define the virial radius .",
    "according to our formula the virial radii of galaxies with @xmath81 and @xmath82 are 260 , 300 , and 350 @xmath7 kpc for early types , and 210 , 240 , and 280 @xmath7 kpc for late types , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig - frac1d ] shows the surface number density of galaxies and the fraction of early - type galaxies as a function of projected clustercentric radius @xmath8 normalized by the cluster virial radius @xmath25 .",
    "they are shown for three luminosity ranges .",
    "the uncertainties of the fraction represent @xmath83 @xmath84 confidence intervals that are determined from the numerical bootstrap procedure .",
    "it shows the well - known mrr or mdr of galaxies in clusters . in all three luminosity",
    "ranges the early - type fraction @xmath85 is almost constant at large distances , and starts to increase inwards at the critical region with @xmath86 , which corresponds to the cluster infall region .",
    "the transition radius seems depending on galaxy luminosity .",
    "for relatively brighter galaxies with @xmath87 ( the subsample c3 ) the transition occurs at @xmath88 , but for fainter galaxies with @xmath89 ( the subsample c1 ) it occurs at @xmath90 . the slope of increase is larger for less luminous galaxies at small @xmath8 . since we are not distinguishing between ellipticals and lenticulars , we can only see their sum is rising toward the cluster center .",
    "fainter galaxies seem more vulnerable to the cluster influence .",
    "this can be considered as evidence for the direct interaction between clusters and infalling galaxies , thinking that less massive galaxies change their morphology at farther distances from clusters relative to massive ones .",
    "however , it can be also due to the mass segregation within clusters that massive cluster member galaxies hardly overshoot beyond the cluster virial radius while the less massive ones overshoot out to a few times the virial radius .",
    "massive galaxies outside the virial radius are likely to be the infalling ones rather than bound cluster members .",
    "figure [ fig - frac1d ] indicates that the early - type fraction is nearly the same near the cluster center regardless of galaxy luminosity .",
    "the central value of @xmath91 actually means that the fraction is close to 1.0 at the cluster center if the projection effect is taken into account @xcite . at radii larger than about @xmath92 ,",
    "@xmath85 approaches the field fraction that depends on the luminosity range and becomes insensitive to the large - scale environment @xcite .",
    "to inspect this characteristic scale in more details we fit @xmath85 as a function of @xmath93 using the function @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a free parameter and @xmath96 is an average value of @xmath85 at @xmath97 .",
    "we define the characteristic radius @xmath98 as the scale where @xmath85 becomes 10% larger than its field value at fixed luminosity .",
    "figure [ fig - fracdd ] shows an almost linear relation between the characteristic radius and the absolute magnitude obtained from five luminosity subsets .",
    "the best - fit linear line is @xmath99 .",
    "we now investigate the dependence of galaxy morphology on both clustercentric radius and nearest neighbor distance .",
    "we select a volume - limited sample of target galaxies associated with clusters whose absolute magnitudes are in a narrow range of @xmath100 and redshifts are less than @xmath101 .",
    "their nearest neighbors are found among all galaxies with @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath103 of the nearest neighbors are calculated using their luminosity and morphology .",
    "dots in figure [ fig - frac2d ] show the distribution of early - type ( _ red points _ ) and late - type ( _ blue points _ ) galaxies in the projected clustercentric radius @xmath8 and projected nearest neighbor distance @xmath104 space .",
    "a spline kernel is used to obtain the smooth distributions of the median @xmath85 in each location of the two panels .",
    "contours with different colors mark constant early - type fractions .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig - frac2d ] contains the target galaxies having early - type neighbors .",
    "it shows that at @xmath105 all contours are nearly horizontal .",
    "this means that outside the cluster virial radius galaxy morphology is determined solely by the nearest neighbor distance and morphology .",
    "when the nearest neighbor is an early type , @xmath85 monotonically increases as @xmath104 decreases .",
    "but if the neighbor is a late type , it first increases , reaches a maximum at @xmath106 , and then decreases as @xmath104 decreases .",
    "the bifurcation occurs at @xmath107 .",
    "this is the morphology - neighbor environment relation that was discovered by @xcite in the general large - scale background density environment .",
    "it is interesting to see that the effects of the nearest neighbor s distance and morphology are the dominant factors of galaxy morphology transformation right down to the cluster infall regions .",
    "the situation abruptly changes at the critical clustercentric radii of @xmath108 . within this radius contours",
    "are nearly vertical when @xmath109 , but are nearly horizontal when @xmath110 . when @xmath111 , @xmath85 monotonically increase as @xmath8 decreases and depends almost entirely on @xmath8 regardless of the morphological type of the nearest neighbor .",
    "existence of this sudden transition near the cluster virial radius suggests that the morphology transformation of cluster galaxies is due to the interactions between galaxies and clusters .",
    "both gravitational and hydrodynamic processes can produce the discontinuity in @xmath85",
    ". it may be the hot cluster gas confined within @xmath112 or gravitational tidal force of cluster acting on galaxies trapped within the virial radius that causes the transformation .",
    "the monotonic increase of @xmath85 at smaller @xmath8 can arise by the increase of the effects of hot cluster gas whose pressure monotonically increases toward the cluster center and/or by interactions with the cluster potential for galaxies with smaller orbital radii that have the shorter crossing time .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ fig - frac2d ] clearly indicates that the clustercentric radius is not the only environmental parameter determining the galaxy morphology but the nearest neighbor does a critical role when the neighbor separation is less than about @xmath113 . the local galaxy number density , to which the mdr is often attributed , can not be responsible for the increase of @xmath85 inwards cluster because the density rises smoothly as @xmath8 decreases and does not have a characteristic break at @xmath98 ( see fig . [ fig - frac1d ] ) .",
    "after all , it is the morphology - clustercentric radius - neighbor environment relation instead of the simple mdr or mrr that determines the morphology of cluster galaxies . here neighbor environment includes both neighbor distance and neighbor morphology .",
    "we emphasize that we are not using the nearest neighbor distance as a measure of local galaxy number density .",
    "it is a measure of the influence of the nearest neighbor galaxy itself irrespectively of other galaxies .",
    "however , there exists statistical correlation between @xmath104 and the local galaxy number density .",
    "if one uses a measure of local galaxy number density , one will still find some correlation of the measure with galaxy morphology within the cluster virial radius .",
    "but it is actually the galaxy - galaxy interaction that causes the correlation .",
    "this is because fixing @xmath8 essentially fixes the local galaxy number density and in figure [ fig - frac2d ] @xmath85 still changes at a fixed @xmath8 .    in the left panel of figure [ fig - frac2d ] galaxies",
    "have early - type neighbors .",
    "it is expected that both cluster and neighbor galaxy impose morphology transformation toward early type on galaxies through hydrodynamic or gravitational effects .",
    "dominance of the role between the two depends on @xmath8 and @xmath104 . at @xmath114",
    "the neighbor galaxy starts to give a major impact on galaxy morphology at the separations @xmath115kpc ( note the difference of @xmath85 between the two panels ) .",
    "but at @xmath116 it happens at @xmath117kpc .",
    "this seems reasonable since near the cluster center the tidal effects by the cluster potential are stronger , the cluster gas has higher pressure , and thus the cluster gives more direct impact on galaxy properties .",
    "one can note from a comparison between two panels of figure [ fig - frac2d ] that directions and levels of contours change completely depending on the morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy at any clustercentric radius when the pair separation is small ( i.e. @xmath118 ) .",
    "the right panel shows that a cluster galaxy tends to become a late type when it has a late - type neighbor within the separation @xmath119 even when the pair is well within the cluster virial radius . for pairs with @xmath120 @xmath121 at the clustercentric radius of @xmath122 when the neighbor is an early type .",
    "but @xmath85 is as low as 0.35 for pairs with the same @xmath104 located at the same @xmath8 when the neighbor is a late type .",
    "it is a clear demonstration that the nearest neighbor has a dominant control over galaxy morphology transformation in clusters when the distance to the neighbor is less than about one tenth of the virial radius of the neighbor galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig - frac2d ] shows that there are not many such short separation pairs at a particular moment within the cluster virial radius and one might think that the majority of cluster galaxies are not affected by neighbors .",
    "however , it can be seen in figure [ fig - frac2d ] that at @xmath123 the mean separation between galaxies becomes so small that the virialized regions associated with galaxies are all overlapping with one another ( not that the upper edge of the galaxy distribution becomes smaller than @xmath124 at @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ fig - frac2d ] ) .",
    "suppose the rms orbital velocity of galaxies within @xmath25 is @xmath126 . if @xmath127 @xmath7 mpc and @xmath128 km s@xmath6 , the crossing time across @xmath25 is about @xmath129 yrs . on the other hand ,",
    "the rms relative velocity between two random cluster galaxies is @xmath130 .",
    "if the virial radius of the galaxies is @xmath131 @xmath7 kpc , their crossing time is @xmath132 yrs , an order of magnitude shorter than the crossing time across the cluster .",
    "this means in this figure that the cluster galaxies at @xmath133 have migrated vertically ( interaction with neighbor galaxies ) many times during the time they make one travel horizontally ( interaction with the cluster ) .",
    "in particular , when @xmath134 , a galaxy starts to interact with another neighbor galaxy as it passes one neighbor galaxy because the virial radii of galaxies all overlap with one another there . then the nearest neighbors may have left significant cumulative effects on morphology of cluster galaxies .",
    "the amount of the cumulative effects increases monotonically as the clustercentric radius decreases , which can produce the trend seen in figure [ fig - frac2d ] .",
    "it is expected that the late - type galaxy sample has a higher fraction of interlopers in the cluster environment .",
    "the pairs involving late - type target or late - type neighbor are more likely to be false pairs , and more widely separated in real space .",
    "if this effect is corrected in figure [ fig - frac2d ] , the contours will be shifted upward .",
    "furthermore , if the fraction of interlopers varies as a function of neighbor separation or clustercentric radius , the contours will be both shifted and stretched . however , the fact that there are discontinuities in @xmath85 shown in figure [ fig - frac2d ] ( near the cluster virial radius @xmath135 and the galaxy merger scale @xmath120 ) and also the fact that these transitions occur at physically meaningful scales , can not be explained if the fraction of interlopers is seriously high .",
    "this suggests that the morphology - environment relation shown by the contours in figure [ fig - frac2d ] is not seriously affected by the interlopers .    though we rejected the clusters that appear to",
    "be interacting or merging , there are some clusters ( @xmath13615% ) whose projected distance to the nearest cluster is less than 10@xmath25 and relative velocity is less than 1000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the galaxies associated with these clusters have been counted more than once in our analysis .",
    "for example , among 3874 galaxies used in figure [ fig - frac2d ] , 874 galaxies are those counted more than once .",
    "when we reject these galaxies , our results remain almost the same .",
    "in addition , our results do not depend sensitively on our definition of the nearest neighbor .",
    "for example , when we varied @xmath137 from 0.5 to 0.75 , our results remain qualitatively the same ( see also @xcite ) .    the mean virial radius of the bcgs , which is typically about @xmath138 , and its @xmath139 range are shown above the @xmath140-axes of figure [ fig - frac2d ] .",
    "we do not find any characteristic feature across the virial radius of the bcgs .",
    "this suggests that the bcgs are not directly participating in transforming the morphology of the cluster galaxies . when the positions of bcgs are used as the centers of clusters , the contours in figure [ fig - frac2d ] are basically unchanged at @xmath141 .",

    "galaxies with @xmath150 show little dependence of @xmath27 on @xmath8 or @xmath104 .",
    "the same phenomenon has been found by @xcite for galaxy pairs in the general background density regions .",
    "the reason that galaxies are brighter when they are located outside the nearest neighbor s virial radius was interpreted by park et al . as due to luminosity transformation through mergers . after a galaxy merges with its closest neighbor",
    ", the second nearest neighbor will become the new nearest neighbor of the merger product .",
    "since the merger product is typically located at a separation from the originally second nearest neighbor larger than the virial radius of the neighbor , a recently merged galaxy will appear in general at the upper edge of the galaxy distribution in figure [ fig - mag2d ] .",
    "as one moves toward the cluster center , the average galaxy number density increases and the mean distance between galaxies decreases .",
    "correspondingly , the distance to the new nearest neighbor of a recently merged galaxy also decreases statistically for decreasing clustercentric radius , and the location of the recent merger products follows the upper edge of the galaxy distribution in figure [ fig - mag2d ] .",
    "the upper left panel of figure [ fig - mag2d ] , showing the early - type target galaxies having early - type neighbors ( the e - e case ) , shows that the maximum luminosity a galaxy can attain slowly decreases as @xmath8 decreases until @xmath8 becomes about @xmath148 .",

    "this can be explained if the luminosity transformation process by galaxy - galaxy mergers becomes less efficient as @xmath8 decreases .",
    "this is reasonable because the relative velocity between neighboring galaxies will be higher and the chance for a pair to merge will decrease toward the cluster center .    a similar @xmath8-dependent trend in luminosity",

    "luminosity of late - type galaxies is on average lower than that of early types .",
    "interestingly , the late - type galaxies having an early - type neighbor ( the l - e galaxies ) are slightly brighter than the early - type galaxies at @xmath155 .",
    "it could be that , as @xmath8 decreases , faint late types are transformed to early types and only relatively bright late types survive near the cluster center .",
    "figure [ fig - mag2d ] also shows that galaxies located near @xmath156 and having a close neighbor are on average the faintest .",
    "namely , even though the most isolated galaxies become faintest at @xmath157 , those with a close neighbor ( @xmath158 ) become faintest at @xmath159 .",
    "the left column of figure [ fig - sf1d ] shows the @xmath28 color of galaxies divided into two morphology and three magnitude bins as a function of @xmath8 .",

    "this is evidence that hydrodynamic interactions between individual galaxies are effective even within the virialized region of clusters . in the case of the l - l galaxies",
    "there is clustercentric radius dependence of color when @xmath163 .",
    "it is likely that this is because the neighbors other than the nearest one tend to be early types as the system moves toward the cluster center .",

    "the sfa of late - type galaxies decreases as @xmath8 decreases .",

    "it is important to note that both @xmath28 color and @xmath164 show only mild dependence on the clustercentric radius @xmath8 , and it is actually the neighboring galaxies that mainly determine the color and sfa of galaxies within clusters as we can see in figure [ fig - sf2d ] .",
    "the second column of figure [ fig - sf2d ] shows @xmath164 in two - dimensional environmental parameter space .",
    "one can notice that the constant @xmath164 contours look very similar to those of @xmath28 color .",

    "the sfa of l - l galaxies shows dependence on @xmath8 when the nearest neighbor separation is not too small ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "this is again probably because the neighbors other than the nearest one tend to be early types as @xmath8 decreases .",
    "the two cases demonstrate that the sfa of the late - type cluster galaxies changes differently depending on the morphology of the neighbor galaxy even well inside the cluster virial radius .",
    "if the hot cluster gas could directly quench the sfa of late - type galaxies , both l - l and l - e galaxies would show the same @xmath8-dependence of sfa regardless of the morphology of the nearest neighbor . since this is not the case , one can conclude that it is after all the galaxy - galaxy hydrodynamic interaction that gives the biggest impacts on the color and sfa of cluster galaxies and that , contrary to intuition , the hot cluster gas is not the main actor quenching the star formation in late - type cluster galaxies at least down to @xmath166 .",
    "we have repeated our analyses using the fainter galaxies with @xmath167 , and arrived at the same conclusion . in the case of early - type galaxies",
    "the @xmath164 parameter is very small and hardly changes .",
    "figure [ fig - sf1d ] shows that the color gradient of galaxies depends only weakly on @xmath8 . in all cases",
    "the central region of galaxies becomes slightly bluer relative to the outskirts as @xmath8 decreases .",
    "the dependence is stronger for fainter galaxies .    in the right column of figure [ fig - sf2d ]",
    "contours represent the distribution of the median @xmath168 at each location of the @xmath8-@xmath104 space .",
    "unlike the @xmath28 color and @xmath164 , the color gradient @xmath168 of late - type galaxies depends on both @xmath8 and @xmath104 inside @xmath25 as can be seen from the slant contours .",
    "we interpret this phenomenon as a result of galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "when a late - type galaxy approaches a neighbor closer than the virial radius of the neighbor , its color gradient always increases ( center becomes relatively bluer ) regardless of neighbor s morphology as shown by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figs . 6 and 7 ) .",
    "the color gradient of a late - type galaxy can increase as it moves toward the cluster center because it becomes more likely to be affected by neighbor galaxies . since there is no neighbor morphology dependence of @xmath168",
    "when a late type approaches a neighbor , the @xmath168 contours are quite similar for l - e and l - l galaxies .",
    "it is also possible that the center of late - type cluster galaxies becomes bluer at smaller @xmath8 because of the tidal effects of the cluster potential @xcite .",
    "the left column of figure [ fig - struc1d ] shows that concentration of intermediate and low luminosity late - type galaxies increases ( @xmath169 decreases ) as @xmath8 decreases below @xmath98 .",
    "but concentration of early types and high luminosity late types is nearly independent of @xmath8 . as argued by @xcite ,",
    "this can be attributed to less compact internal structure of late types which are more vulnerable to tidal effects than early types .",
    "the first column of figure [ fig - struc2d ] shows the median @xmath169 contours for the intermediate luminosity galaxies with @xmath161 . again",
    "@xmath169 of early types hardly changes as @xmath8 or @xmath104 vary . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath169 of late types starts to decrease ( galaxies become compacter ) at @xmath170 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the structural parameter @xmath169 shows an abrupt change at the characteristic scale .",
    "a similar phenomenon can be found also for the central velocity dispersion .",
    "the fact that the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath169 exists only when @xmath171 , gives an important clue for understanding the structural evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "the local galaxy number density can not be the reason for the discontinuous @xmath8-dependence of @xmath169 because the local density is a smooth function of @xmath8 .",
    "the discontinuity can appear due to repeated gravitational interactions of cluster member galaxies with cluster potential or with other galaxies as they make trapped orbital motions within the cluster virial radius .",
    "it might also seem possible to explain the discontinuity by the hydrodynamic effects of hot cluster gas .",
    "for example , the cold gas in the outer part of late - type galaxies can evaporate or be stripped when they fall into the hot cluster gas clump or encounter the hot halo gas of their neighbor galaxies .",
    "then their outer part will become redder and dimmer .",
    "this may cause the color @xmath28 and color gradient @xmath172 increase and inverse concentration index @xmath169 decreases as @xmath8 or @xmath104 decreases .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain why the central stellar velocity dispersion of late types should also increase shown in the second column of figure [ fig - struc2d ] by quenching the sfa in the outer part .    figure [ fig - struc1d ] ( panels d , e , and f ) shows that the central velocity dispersion of galaxies in general increases as @xmath8 decreases except for low luminosity galaxies .",
    "the trend is clear for intermediate luminosity galaxies , in particular .",
    "the second column of figure [ fig - struc2d ] shows constant @xmath32 contours of intermediate luminosity ( @xmath161 ) galaxies divided into four different target - neighbor morphology cases .",
    "the central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath32 shows a characteristic behavior that it depends only on @xmath104 at @xmath173 but starts to depend only on @xmath8 when @xmath174 .",
    "would the increase of @xmath32 within the cluster virial radius be due to the tidal interaction of galaxies with other galaxies or with the cluster potential ?",
    "one can find a clue from figure [ fig - struc1d ] which shows that the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath169 and @xmath32 is largest for intermediate luminosity galaxies .",
    "this may be because the intermediate luminosity galaxies have suffered from the interaction with cluster potential more strongly than brighter or fainter ones . even though galaxy - galaxy encounters in general increase @xmath32 of late - type galaxies ( see l - e cases at @xmath175 and fig",
    ". 8 of @xcite ) , it is not true at @xmath133 as can be seen in figure [ fig - struc2d ]",
    ". the very bright massive galaxies at @xmath176 may be the galaxies falling into the cluster for the first time , and those which fell in long time ago are now sitting near the cluster center . in both cases",
    "the effects of the cluster potential will be relatively small .",
    "on the other hand , the small faint galaxies are likely to have large orbital radii , and can cross the cluster much fewer times than the massive ones .",
    "this is supported by the fact that @xmath98 is larger for fainter galaxies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - fracdd ] for example ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the intermediate luminosity galaxies are most susceptible to change in structure and kinematics through interactions with the cluster potential .",
    "our study of @xmath169 and @xmath32 of cluster galaxies makes it clear that late - type galaxies become more centrally concentrated and have higher central velocity dispersion as they approach the cluster center .",
    "our results suggest that late - type galaxies become earlier in sfa through hydrodynamic interactions between galaxies and also in morphology and kinematics through tidal interactions as they approach the cluster center .",
    "paucity of late - type galaxies near cluster center is a result of combined effects of gravitational and hydrodynamic interaction with the cluster and the nearest neighbor galaxies .",
    "we use the petrosian radius in the @xmath33-band image as a measure of galaxy size .",
    "figure [ fig - struc1d ] ( panels g , h , and i ) shows that the intermediate luminosity galaxies show very slight decrease of @xmath54 as @xmath8 decrease .",
    "the third column of figure [ fig - struc2d ] shows again that there is a weak clustercentric radius dependence of @xmath54 at @xmath174 for late - type galaxies .",
    "the decrease of @xmath54 does not seem to be due to the blending of galaxy images in high density regions like clusters because it suddenly occurs at the physically meaningful scale ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the degree of blending of galaxy images should be a smooth function of @xmath8 .",
    "the size of late - type galaxies does not change significantly by interactions with other galaxies as shown in figure 8 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the decrease of @xmath54 of late types at @xmath177 shown in figures [ fig - struc1d ] and [ fig - struc2d ] should be attributed to the cluster .",
    "late - type galaxies can appear smaller when their outer part becomes dimmer as they orbit within a cluster and get quenched in star formation in disks .",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the mrr or mdr in clusters .",
    "they are divided into two categories : mechanisms relying on gravitational and hydrodynamic processes ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the mechanisms based on gravitational interactions include galaxy - galaxy tidal interaction , galaxy - cluster potential tidal interaction , and interaction with the general tidal background ( harassment ) .",
    "those based on hydrodynamic interactions comprise ram pressure stripping , viscous stripping , or thermal evaporation of cold gas of late - type galaxies by hot cluster gas , and removal of hot halo gas reservoir causing stopping of gas supply and quenching of star formation ( strangulation ) .",
    "we will examine each of these mechanisms against our findings .",
    "galaxy - galaxy tidal interaction    tidal interaction between galaxies can be efficient at removing or consuming the cold gas in galaxies , and tend to transform late types into early types @xcite . however , this mechanism is usually excluded as a process responsible for the mrr or mdr because the orbital velocity of cluster galaxies are very high and the tidal energy deposit during the short encounters is too small to significantly affect galaxy structure @xcite . at @xmath178 ,",
    "the structural parameter of late - type galaxies depend only on the environment determined by the neighbor galaxies .",
    "but @xmath177 they strongly depend on @xmath8 , but only weakly or negligibly on @xmath104 ( see fig . [ fig - struc2d ] ) .",
    "this tells that the galaxy - galaxy tidal interactions do not instantly change the structure of cluster member galaxies much .",
    "the parameters @xmath169 and @xmath54 do show a weak dependence on @xmath104 for l - e galaxies within @xmath179 .",
    "but this may have also been resulted by hydrodynamic interactions with their early - type neighbor .",
    "even though we exclude the significance of the tidal effects of galaxy - galaxy interactions on the internal structure and kinematics of cluster galaxies , it should be emphasized that the hydrodynamic effects of galaxy - galaxy interactions can give significant impacts on their sfa .",
    "galaxy - cluster potential interaction    individual galaxies can suffer from the tidal force of the overall cluster mass @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is usually excluded in explaining the mrr or mdr because the time scale required for morphology transformation , being several cluster crossing time , is rather too long .",
    "the tidal force will be stronger toward the cluster center , and the strong dependence of @xmath169 and @xmath32 on @xmath8 within @xmath179 can easily explained by this mechanism .",
    "the internal structure of the intermediate mass galaxies , in particular , seems to have been significantly affected by this mechanism .",
    "but the tidal interaction with cluster potential may not be sufficient for morphology transformation of the very bright or faint cluster galaxies .",
    "harassment    galaxies can be also perturbed by the tidal force background from numerous distant encounters with other cluster members @xcite . even though individual encounters are too short for the tidal force to activate structural changes , galaxy structure may significantly change through such numerous weak encounters .",
    "the sudden transition of the structure parameters can be explained by repeated passage of member galaxies within the cluster .",
    "so both interaction with cluster potential and harassment may account for the @xmath8-dependence of morphology and structure parameters of intermediate mass galaxies , in particular , whose cluster crossing time is reasonably short but the path length is still long .",
    "galaxy - galaxy hydrodynamic interaction    the effects of hydrodynamic interaction between galaxies on cluster galaxy properties have been found important in this work .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy interaction turns out to be the major mechanism for quenching sfa of late - type galaxies within clusters . as can be seen in the scatter plot of galaxies in the @xmath8-@xmath104 plane , distance to the neighbors monotonically decreases as @xmath8 decreases and galaxies become always located within neighbor galaxy s virial radius when @xmath180 .",
    "in this situation galaxies are constantly undergoing hydrodynamic effects and mass exchange with neighbors .",
    "we argued above that the vertical contours for @xmath169 and @xmath32 can be explained by the gravitational tidal force from cluster itself .",
    "however , the nearly horizontal contours for the @xmath28 and @xmath164 parameters can be only explained by hydrodynamic effects of neighbor galaxies . it should be emphasized that the high - speed orbital motion of cluster galaxies weakens the importance of galaxy - galaxy tidal interactions , but can make the galaxy - galaxy hydrodynamic interaction very important .",
    "it was also found that bright galaxies are more isolated from influential neighbors than relatively fainter ones in clusters , which has been interpreted as due to merger - driven luminosity transformation .",
    "the fact that early - type galaxies show such trend more strongly is consistent with this interpretation .",
    "relative paucity of bright galaxies near cluster center ( except for the bcgs ) seems to indicate that the frequency of galaxy merger decreases as the clustercentric radius decreases .",
    "ram pressure stripping    many rich clusters like the abell clusters we are analyzing , are holding hot x - ray emitting gas .",
    "a late - type galaxy falling into such a hot gas tank can strip off its cold gas and terminate sfa @xcite .",
    "the hot gas is trapped roughly within the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "therefore , any mechanism relying on hydrodynamic interaction with the hot cluster gas will have a characteristic scale of onset of cluster influence near the cluster virial radius .",
    "a major problem with the ram pressure stripping and other hydrodynamic processes in accounting for the morphology segregation , is that these mechanisms can only reduce the sfa and can not change galaxy structure while the observations require the fraction of bulge - dominated galaxies to increase significantly as the clustercentric radius decreases .",
    "therefore , even though this mechanism can explain the radial variation of the fraction of galaxies that are red and inactive , it can not explain the radial variation of concentration or central velocity dispersion .",
    "it is also pointed out that only loosely bound thin clouds can be swept out of the galaxy and molecular clouds are mostly unaffected by this interaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have shown in figure [ fig - sf2d ] that it is actually the galaxy - galaxy interaction that mainly controls the color and sfa of the cluster late - type galaxies rather than the hot cluster gas .",
    "viscous stripping / thermal evaporation    the cold gas in a late - type galaxy moving through the hot intracluster gas can be stripped off by momentum transfer between the cold disk gas and hot cluster gas @xcite , or be evaporated by the thermal conduction @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms can be activated when a galaxy fall into the hot cluster gas pool , and can give rise to a characteristic feature in the radial variation of galaxy sfa as observed in this work .",
    "however , they share the same problem the ram - pressure stripping mechanism has in that they can not modify galaxy structure .",
    "furthermore , the hot cluster gas can not explain the environmental dependence of color and sfa of late - type galaxies either .",
    "if the hot cluster gas predominantly controls the color and sfa of cluster late types , the contours in figure [ fig - sf2d ] should be vertical independently of @xmath104 , which is not true .",
    "strangulation    according to the current understanding of galaxy evolution , spiral galaxies maintain sfa by accreting gas from their hot gas reservoir .",
    "it has been proposed that a spiral galaxy fell into the hot intracluster gas can lose its hot halo gas and stop supplying gas into its disk @xcite .",
    "then the galaxy just consume its already existing cold gas to form stars , and the sfa halts after some time when all cold gas is consumed .",
    "compared to the ram pressure stripping , this mechanism will quench the sfa in late - type galaxies in a delayed action . as being a pure hydrodynamic process",
    ", it also has the problem that the structural parameters of galaxies can not be changed .",
    "this mechanism also predicts the contours to be vertical ( dominance of cluster influence ) for the early - type fraction , color , and sfa parameters in figures [ fig - frac2d ] and [ fig - sf2d ] , which is not supported by observations .    to inspect galaxy properties for their dependence on hot cluster gas in more details",
    ", we studied the early - type fraction in the @xmath104-@xmath8 space separately for x - ray bright ( @xmath181 erg s@xmath6 ) and faint ( @xmath182 erg s@xmath6 ) abell clusters .",
    "figure [ fig - fracxray ] shows that the magnitude of @xmath85 is not particularly higher for x - ray bright clusters .",
    "this can be another evidence against the idea that the hot intracluster gas plays the main role in morphology transformation of late - type galaxies in massive clusters .    to summarize , the interaction responsible for the mrr / mdr in clusters can be either galaxy - galaxy or galaxy - cluster interactions from the point of view of the actor , or either gravitational ( mass - mass ) or hydrodynamic ( gas - gas ) interactions in terms of physical process .",
    "figure [ fig - struc2d ] suggests that the galaxy - cluster tidal interactions are responsible for structural and kinematic changes of cluster late - type galaxies toward early morphological type .",
    "late types seem to become more spheroidal through such interactions .",
    "figure [ fig - sf2d ] indicates that the hydrodynamic interactions with early - type neighbors are responsible for reddening and sfa quenching of cluster late - type galaxies .",
    "therefore , the morphology transformation of late - type galaxies seems to take place in clusters through galaxy - galaxy hydrodynamic interactions and galaxy - cluster / galaxy - galaxy gravitational interactions .",
    "however , it is reasonable to accept that all above mechanisms are contributing to the mrr / mdr in clusters to some extent and a particular process can not fully account for all observational aspects .",
    "we have studied the dependence of various galaxy properties on the clustercentric radius and the environment attributed to the nearest neighbor galaxy using the sdss galaxies associated with the abell galaxy clusters .",
    "our major findings are as follows .",
    "there exists a characteristic scale where the galaxy properties such as morphology , color gradient , and structural parameters suddenly start to depend on the clustercentric radius at fixed nearest neighbor environment .",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions with nearby early - type galaxies seem to be the main drive to quenching star formation activity of late - type galaxies in clusters .",
    "we do not find evidence that the hot cluster gas is the main drive down to the clustercentric radius of @xmath185 .",
    "existence of the characteristic scale means that the local galaxy number density is not responsible for the mdr in cluster because the local density is a smooth function of the clustercentric radius and has no discontinuity in general .",
    "the mdr appears working in clusters and also in the field because of the statistical correlation between the local density and the nearest neighbor distance .",
    "what is really working in clusters is the morphology - clustercentric radius - neighbor environment relation , where the neighbor environment means both neighbor morphology and the mass density attributed to the neighbor .    according to the third and fourth conclusions ,",

    "<S> we also find that the viable mechanisms which can account for the clustercentric radius dependence of the structural and internal kinematics parameters are harassment and interaction of galaxies with the cluster potential . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology transformation of the late - type galaxies in clusters seems to have taken place through both galaxy - galaxy hydrodynamic interactions and galaxy - cluster / galaxy - galaxy gravitational interactions . </S>"
