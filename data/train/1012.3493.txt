    "the non - perturbative physics of @xmath10 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath2 decays is governed by two lorentz - invariant @xmath0 form factors , namely the vector , denoted @xmath11 , and the scalar , @xmath12 .",
    "a good knowledge of these form factors paves the way for the determination of many parameters of the standard model , such as the quark - mixing matrix element @xmath13 obtained from @xmath3 decays @xcite , or the strange - quark mass @xmath14 determined from the scalar qcd strange spectral function @xcite .    until recently ,",
    "the main source of experimental information on @xmath0 form factors have been @xmath3 decays . lately ,",
    "five experiments have collected data on semileptonic and leptonic @xmath15 decays : bnl - e865 , kloe , ktev , istra+ , and na48 .",
    "additional knowledge on the @xmath0 form factors can be gained from the dominant cabibbo - suppressed @xmath16 decay : the channel @xmath2 .",
    "a detailed spectrum for @xmath17 produced and analyzed by belle was published in 2007 @xcite .",
    "also , preliminary babar spectra with similar statistics have appeared recently in conference proceedings @xcite and , finally , besiii should produce results for this decay in the future @xcite .",
    "the new data sets provide the substrate for up - to - date theoretical analyses of the @xmath0 form factors . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have performed a reanalysis of the @xmath2 spectrum of @xcite .",
    "more recently , we carried out an analysis with restrictions from @xmath3 experiments @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , the knowledge of these form factors consists of two tasks .",
    "the first of them is to determine their value at the origin , @xmath18 , crucial in order to disentangle the product @xmath19 .",
    "historically , chiral perturbation theory has been the main tool to study @xmath18 , but recently lattice qcd collaborations have produced more accurate results for this quantity @xcite .",
    "second , one must know the energy dependence of the form factors , which is required when calculating phase - space integrals for @xmath3 decays or when analyzing the detailed shape of the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "in our work we concentrate on the latter aspect of the problem and therefore it is convenient to introduce form factors normalized to one at the origin on the form factors . ]",
    "f_+,0(q^2)=f_+,0(q^2)/f_+,0(0 )  .    a salient feature of the form factors in the kinematical region relevant for @xmath3 decays , _ i_.e .",
    "@xmath20 , is that they are real . within the allowed phase - space",
    "they admit a taylor expansion and the energy dependence is customarily translated into constants @xmath21 defined as f_+,0(q^2)=1+_+,0 + _ + , 0  ( ) ^2 +  .",
    "[ fftaylor ] in @xmath2 decays , however , since @xmath22 , one deals with a different kinematical regime in which the form factors develop imaginary parts , rendering the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ fftaylor ] ) inadmissible .",
    "one must then resort to more sophisticated treatments .",
    "moreover , in order to fully benefit from the available experimental data , it is desirable to employ representations of the form factors that are valid for both @xmath3 and @xmath2 decays .",
    "dispersive representations of the form factors provide a powerful tool to achieve this goal .    from general principles ,",
    "the form factors must satisfy a dispersion relation . supplementing this constraint with unitarity ,",
    "the dispersion relation has a well - known closed - form solution within the elastic approximation referred to as the omns representation @xcite .",
    "although simple , this solution requires the detailed knowledge of the phase of @xmath23 up to infinity , which is unrealistic .",
    "an advantageous strategy to circumvent this problem is the use of additional subtractions , as done , for instance , for the pion form factor in ref .",
    "subtractions in the dispersion relation entail a suppression of the integrand in the dispersion integral for higher energies .",
    "the outcome of these tests is that for our purposes an optimal description of @xmath23 is reached with three subtractions and two resonances .",
    "here we quote the resulting expression f_+(s ) =  .",
    "[ dispff ] in the last equation , @xmath24 and the two subtraction constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 are related to the taylor expansion of eq .  ( [ fftaylor ] ) as @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is opportune to treat them as free parameters that capture our ignorance of the higher energy part of the integral .",
    "the constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 can then be determined through the fit .",
    "the main advantage of this procedure , advocated for example in refs .",
    "@xcite , is that the subtraction constants turn out to be less model dependent as they are determined by the best fit to the data .",
    "it is important to stress that eq .",
    "( [ dispff ] ) remains valid beyond the elastic approximation provided @xmath31 is the phase of the form factor , instead of the corresponding scattering phase .",
    "but , of course , in order to employ it in practice we must have a model for the phase .",
    "as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take a form inspired by the rcht treatment of refs .",
    "@xcite with two vector resonances . for the detailed expressions we refer to the original works . with eq .",
    "( [ dispff ] ) , the transition from the kinematical region of @xmath2 to that of @xmath3 decays is straightforward and the dominant low - energy behavior of @xmath23 is encoded in @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the cut - off @xmath32 in the dispersion integral is introduced to quantify the suppression of the higher energy part of the integrand . the stability of the results is checked varying this cut - off in a wide range from @xmath33",
    ".    in @xmath2 decays , the scalar form factor is suppressed kinematically .",
    "albeit marginal , the contribution from @xmath34 can not be neglected in the lower energy part of the spectrum . here",
    ", we keep this contribution fixed using the results for @xmath34 from the coupled - channel dispersive analysis of refs .  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the spectrum for @xmath2 produces a wealth of physical results , many of them with great accuracy , e.g. , the mass and width of the @xmath37 .",
    "we have advocated by means of monte carlo simulations that a joined analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra further constrains the low - energy part of the vector form - factor yielding results with a better precision @xcite .",
    "this idea was pursued in our recent work @xcite .    in order to include",
    "the experimental information available from @xmath3 decays and for the want of true unfolded data sets from these experiments we adopt the following strategy . in our fits ,",
    "the @xmath38 that is to be minimized contains a standard part from the @xmath2 spectrum and a piece which constrains the parameters @xmath39 using information from @xmath3 experiments . for the latter experimental values we employ the results of the compilation of @xmath40 analyses performed by antonelli _",
    "et al . _",
    "for the flavianet working group on kaon decays in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .      from the minimization of the @xmath38 a collection of physical results can be derived .",
    "some of them are obtained directly from the fit , such as @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the mass and width of the @xmath37 . with the form factor under control , one can then obtain other results such as the phase - space integrals for @xmath3 decays . here , we present the main results of ref .",
    "a careful comparison with other results found in the literature can be found in that reference .",
    "we start by quoting our final results for the mass and the width of the @xmath44 [ massandwidth ] m_k^*(892)^ & = & 892.03(0.19)_stat(0.44)_sys  , + _ k^*(892)^ & = & 46.53 ( 0.38)_stat(1.0)_sys  .",
    "these results are obtained from the complex pole position on the second riemann sheet , @xmath45 , following the definition @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the mass and width thus obtained are rather different from the parameters that enter our description of the phase of @xmath23 . when comparing results from different works one must always be sure that the same definition is used in all cases . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we showed that our results are compatible with others _ provided _ the pole position prescription is employed for all the analyses .",
    "the final results for the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 read [ lambdas ] _ + 10 ^ 3 & = & 25.49(0.30)_stat ( 0.06)_s_cut , + _ +  10 ^ 4 & = & 12.22(0.10)_stat ( 0.10)_s_cut . in this case , the uncertainty from the variation of @xmath32 contributes as indicated . from the expansion of eq  ( [ dispff ] ) we can calculate the third coefficient of a taylor series of the type of eq .",
    "( [ fftaylor ] ) .",
    "we find _ +  10 ^ 5=8.87(0.08)_stat ( 0.05)_s_cut . these results are in good agreement with other analyses but have smaller uncertainties since our fits are constrained by @xmath2 and @xmath3 experiments .    in the extraction of @xmath13 from the @xmath3 decay widths , one must perform phase - space integrals where the form - factors play the central role .",
    "the integrals are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite . from our form - factors",
    "we obtain the following results i_k^0_e 3 = 0.15466(17 )  , i_k^0_3 = 0.10276(10 )  , + i_k^+_e 3 = 0.15903(17 )  , i_k^+_3 = 0.10575(11 )  .",
    "the uncertainties were calculated with a mc sample of parameters obeying the results of our fits with the correlations properly included .",
    "the final uncertainties are competitive if compared with the averages of @xcite and the central values agree .",
    "another interesting result that can be extracted from the @xmath2 spectrum is the @xmath0 isospin-1/2 @xmath9-wave scattering phase .",
    "the decay in question is indeed a very clean source of information about @xmath0 interactions , since the hadrons are isolated in the final state .",
    "below inelastic thresholds , the phase of the form - factor is the scattering phase , as dictated by watson s theorem . from the expansion of the corresponding partial - wave @xmath47-matrix element in the vicinity of the @xmath0 threshold",
    "one can determine the @xmath0 @xmath9-wave threshold parameters .",
    "with our results , the first three read [ scattlengres ] m_^-^3 a_1 ^ 1/2 10 & = & 0.166(4 )  , + m_^-^5 b_1 ^ 1/2 10 ^ 2 & = & 0.258(9 )  , + m_^-^7 c_1 ^ 1/2 10 ^ 3 & = & 0.90(3 )  .",
