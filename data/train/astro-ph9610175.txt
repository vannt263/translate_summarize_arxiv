    "the main question addressed in this work is how large is the contribution of small numbers of bright stars to the near - infrared ( near - ir ) integrated light of a star cluster ? for a cluster of given age and metallicity , the size of the contribution will depend on the evolutionary state of the stars in question as characterized by their temperature and luminosity .",
    "more generally , the effects of changing small numbers of stars will depend on the total mass of the cluster and the cluster s initial mass function , its imf . for stochastic variations of a given size the integrated light from less massive clusters",
    "will obviously be more strongly influenced than will the light from more massive clusters .",
    "the advantages of including the @xmath2 bands in the analysis is that the effects of variations in the numbers of later type giants and supergiants in a cluster on the integrated light will be much more evident than if only optical wavelengths were examined .",
    "the age range analyzed @xmath3 was chosen because the available isochrones contain all relevant stellar evolutionary phases up to the end of the c - burning phase for stars with @xmath4 and up to the end of the early asymptotic giant branch ( e - agb ) for stars with @xmath5 ; for stars with @xmath6 , corresponding to @xmath7 , the evolution is followed up to the he - flash ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , although the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) for intermediate mass models is missing , the he - burning phases are covered by the models in the age range considered .",
    "the tp - agb according to models by @xcite was taken into account in a later stage of this work providing information on its contribution to the integrated light of stellar populations and allowing a better approximation to real star clusters concerning their integrated colors and stochastic fluctuations .",
    "the lower age limit selected avoids massive stars in evolutionary stages with very high mass loss rates , for which bolometric correction and temperatures are very uncertain .",
    "the present work is restricted to solar metallicity since the bolometric corrections and the color - temperature relations available come from solar neighborhood stars .",
    "this restriction , though , do not affect our primary goal which is to examine stochastic effects in stellar populations on the integrated colors of those populations .",
    "similar studies using visible bands have been carried out by , e. g. , @xcite . in particular , @xcite employ a homogeneous set of stellar evolution models that include convective overshooting and cover the whole range of evolutionary phases .",
    "they calculated integrated ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) colors and synthetic h - r diagrams of star clusters as a function of age , and applied their results to the known age and color distribution of clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . beside the stochastic effects on the imf",
    ", they also take into account the effects of dispersion in the stellar ages . in summary , among other important results , their analysis indicates that integrated @xmath10 colors show a significant spread for ages at which few luminous agb stars are present .",
    "thus , they conclude that it is necessary to take stochastic effects into account when the integrated light of a cluster is used to estimate the cluster s age and chemical composition . @xcite",
    "employ the photometric models of simple stellar populations ( ssps ) by @xcite and the integrated @xmath10 colors of lmc star clusters ( @xcite ) to investigate the history of star formation in the lmc .",
    "they present theoretical integrated @xmath10 colors of ssps with ranges in age and metallicity that span the observed ranges for the clusters .",
    "they analyze the dispersion in the observed integrated colors of the clusters and conclude that in @xmath10 stochastic effects dominate the color dispersion of the young clusters .",
    "dispersions in the colors due to variations in reddening and metallicity become significant for clusters older than 300myr . in summary ,",
    "the highest dispersion in the integrated colors of the ssps occurs for ages between 6.3 and 25myr as a consequence of the number and luminosity of red supergiants .",
    "similar results were obtained for different metallicities , except for smaller dispersions in young , metal poor ssps where red supergiants are rare compared to a more metal rich population .",
    "the near - ir light of a stellar system can be dominated by only a small number of luminous , red stars most of whose energy is emitted in the near - ir ( e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , stochastical variations in the numbers of these stars could lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the age and/or metallicity of the system if such estimates are based on integrated light measurements .",
    "thus , in the present study we analyze the effect on the integrated @xmath2 light from a single - generation stellar population , of stochastic variations in its imf .",
    "this issue is addressed here in the hope of setting useful constraints on stellar populations of galaxies , allowing one to decide how much an integrated observation in @xmath2 of a star system of certain age and metallicity can be affected by the stochastic nature of the imf in single - generation stellar populations .    in section",
    "2 the data employed and the procedure carried out to transform the theoretical h - r diagram into observational color - magnitude diagrams are described .",
    "section  3 presents the monte carlo technique used to carry out the simulations and a comparison between a young ssp and an intermediate age one .",
    "section  4 discusses the relationship between the stochastic effects and the age of a ssp . in section  5",
    "the results are compared with observations of lmc star clusters .",
    "finally , section  6 presents the conclusions .",
    "the stellar evolution models by schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 , hereafter ssmm ) were employed in the present study .",
    "basically they present models from 0.8 to 120 @xmath11 , at metallicities @xmath12 and solar , with mass loss and convective overshooting .",
    "the stellar tracks were transformed to isochrones by using the code made accessible by g. meynet .",
    "the fainter end of the main sequence ( ms ) ( @xmath13 ) was extended down to 0.07@xmath11 by using the information in @xcite ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and @xcite ( mass - luminosity relation to get @xmath16 ) . for",
    "most of the ages investigated less massive stars have not yet contracted to the ms phase , as at least 1gyr is needed for a complete ms to be formed ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "however , a complete ms was used here , even for the younger ssps , as a rough approximation to real clusters where low mass stars are in pre - ms phases .",
    "this approximation should be a lower limit in terms of near - ir integrated light contribution , since low mass contracting stars are cooler and brighter than their future ms location .    in the present context",
    ", the fact that the models do not take into account evolution beyond the e - agb for intermediate mass stars must be considered .",
    "@xcite carried out @xmath17 observations of stars in 12 intermediate age lmc clusters showing that around 60% of their integrated @xmath18 light comes from agb stars , consistent with the results of persson et al .",
    "( 1983 ) and frogel et al .",
    "@xcite constructed stellar population models by using @xcite stellar evolution models complemented with observations of tp - agb .",
    "their models indicate that the whole agb contribute with 60% at j and 70% at k to the integrated light of a 0.4 - 2gyr ssp , the tp - agb stars alone contributing with 20% at k and a little less at j. the agreement between these studies and their results support the conclusion that the e - agb is the major contributor to the whole agb in the integrated near - ir light of intermediate age star clusters .",
    "the tp - agb phase , though , has not negligible contribution and should be kept in mind , especially when stochastic variations in such stellar populations are to be evaluated .",
    "the @xmath2 ( and @xmath19 , in the kron - cousins system ) colors , in a standardized system , are from @xcite for ms stars from b8 to k5 and for giants from g0 to m6 , and from bessell ( 1991 , hereafter b91 ) for later ms spectral types . when needed , the colors for ms stars earlier than b8 were linearly extrapolated using the hottest spectral types available ; the same has been done for giants earlier than g0 .",
    "colors for o5-m5 supergiants , all considered as evolved stars with @xmath20 , are from @xcite . in this case , the transformations in @xcite were used to bring koornneef s colors into their system .      in order to transform the theoretical h - r diagram into a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for comparison with observations , bolometric corrections and temperature scale compiled by schmidt - kaler ( 1982 , hereafter sk82 ) for giants , supergiants and for ms stars of spectral type earlier than m and those determined by b91 for fainter stars were employed .",
    "the link between the colors and bc@xmath21 and @xmath14 was guided by the spectral type provided in both sets of data .",
    "an exception to this procedure was adopted for the m dwarfs , for which b91 gives colors , @xmath14 , and all other information needed to get bc@xmath21 ( his table 2 ) .",
    "the bolometric correction was defined here as bc@xmath22 and its zero - point was set by adopting bc@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the consistency between b91 and sk82 data was checked by looking at the flux density of a zero - magnitude star in both scales .",
    "the @xmath19 magnitude difference at @xmath25 is 0.03 mag brighter in the johnson system ( adopted by sk82 ) , which is insignificant given the uncertainties .",
    "the temperature scale adopted was checked at spectral type k7v ( where the data from the different sources were merged ) and no significant discrepancy was found . on the other hand , at this spectral type there was a difference of 0.09 mag in the bolometric correction of sk82 and b91 ( in the sense that bc is larger in sk82 ) .",
    "the option adopted was to smooth out the bc around @xmath26k ( i.e. k7v ) as long as this procedure is confined to the fainter end of the ms and will not have a major effect on integrated light models .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the importance of stochastic effects on the imf of star clusters in the @xmath10 bands . similarly , in the present study we used a monte carlo technique as an approach to assess the impact of stochastic variations in the imf of single - generation systems on near - ir bands .",
    "the monte carlo integration used simulates the stellar mass distribution of a system of a given age : a randomly generated mass is weighted on the imf and the process is repeated until the number of stars sampled reachs a preset value .",
    "a total of 100 simulations of systems containing a variable number of stars ( @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) is performed and the mean and dispersion of the integrated colors are computed .",
    "following is a more detailed description of the procedure used to carry out the simulations .",
    "an introduction to monte carlo methods is given by , e. g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the imf of a stellar system gives the relative number of stars within a mass range and it is employed in its usual definition @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a constant and @xmath31 the imf slope .",
    "@xmath32 is the value corresponding to the @xcite luminosity function .",
    "@xmath30 is determined by integrating the imf from the lowest ( @xmath33=0.07 ) to the highest stellar mass ( @xmath34=120 ) in the system and by normalizing the number of stars in the system to 1 .",
    "specifically , @xmath35 this normalization is critical for the present application of the monte carlo method since now @xmath36 can be treated as a probability distribution function ( pdf ) which gives the probability that a random mass @xmath37 is in the range between @xmath16 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath36 now obeys the following conditions : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the lower and upper mass limits of the stellar system .",
    "now , the pdf @xmath36 can be transformed into a new pdf @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a single - valued function of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the probability of occurrence of the random variable @xmath43 within @xmath44 and the probability of occurrence of the random variable @xmath37 within @xmath45 must be the same , i. e. , @xmath46    from eq .",
    "( [ imf ] ) , a cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) can be constructed which gives the probability that the mass @xmath37 is less than or equal to @xmath16 , i. e. , @xmath47 and , consequently , @xmath48 , resulting from eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) @xmath49    this means that the cdf is a uniform function for which any value is equally likely in the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the cdf property of uniformity between 0 and 1 allows one to use a random number generator ( namely , that of parker and miller with bays - durham shuffle as presented by @xcite ) to sample values for the cdf @xmath50 . since the random variable @xmath16 and the cdf @xmath50",
    "are related uniquely , it is possible to sample @xmath16 by sampling @xmath42 first and then to solve the result of the integration of eq .",
    "( [ cdf ] ) for @xmath16 , i. e. ,    @xmath51^{-1/x}\\ ] ]    each stellar mass @xmath16 generated in this way is interpolated linearly on an isochrone in order to get the corresponding @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the correlations assembled in section 2.3 were then linearly interpolated to the colors corresponding to these values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the mass difference between consecutive points on an isochrone is proportional to the evolutionary lifetime .",
    "therefore a random mass will have larger probability to be sampled in evolutionary stages for which there is a relatively wider range of masses indicating longer lifetimes .",
    "consequently , for a ssp of a given age , the fact that the number of stars in each evolutionary phase is proportional to its lifetime is taken into account .",
    "integrated fluxes and colors are then computed by appropriately combining the fluxes and colors from the individual stars with the weights as described above .      in this section ,",
    "a comparison of the simulations carried out for solar metallicity ssps with ages 32myr ( @xmath54 ) and 1gyr ( @xmath55 ) is presented . with the adopted criterion that stars with @xmath20 are supergiants",
    ", it turns out that the post ms stars in the 32myr ssp are slightly brighter than this limit .",
    "we also computed simulations treating these stars as giants for comparison .",
    "although the colors of the giants and supergiants differ , we find no significant differences between these two sets of simulations apart from those resulting from the stochastic effects .    fig .  1 shows how the young stellar population is distributed in cmds formed by both visible and near - ir bands ( a , c ) and exclusively by near - ir bands ( b , d ) .",
    "1a and 1b show different cmds for the same ssp simulated , while figs . 1c and 1d show the same for another simulation .",
    "each ssp has @xmath56 stars and an imf with @xmath32 . only the upper ms and the supergiants , the only regions for which the monte carlo simulations reveal significant variations , are shown .",
    "the integrated colors corresponding to each cmd are indicated on the panels .",
    "2 corresponds to fig . 1 for an intermediate age stellar population .",
    "we also ran an experiment to see , in the absence of any stochastic effects , how many stars would be required to produce at least one post ms star in such ssps .",
    "we found that young ssps ( @xmath54 ) containing 140 stars for an imf slope @xmath57 , 8990 stars for @xmath32 and 136540 stars for @xmath58 should contain one post ms star if a continuous imf is considered .",
    "similarly , intermediate age ssps ( @xmath55 ) containing 170 stars for an imf slope @xmath57 , 890 stars for @xmath32 and 5590 stars for @xmath58 should contain one post ms star . for ssps less populous than these the stochastic nature of the imf can still produce post ms stars and , consequently , color variations as large as those found for ssps with number of post ms npms=1 .",
    "if an ssp is far less populous then there would be no post ms stars , and the integrated fluxes would be dominated by upper ms stars with little spread in color , which results in smaller color fluctuations .",
    "3 presents the integrated colors ( @xmath59 ) , ( @xmath60 ) , ( @xmath61 ) as a function of the number of post ms stars for the young ssp ( a , b and c ) and the older one ( d , e and f ) , where 3 slopes of the imf are also considered .",
    "fluctuations in the colors come from 100 simulations for ssps of fixed total number of stars and are represented by twice the standard deviation from the mean color .",
    "( @xmath59 ) has the largest fluctuations because it is most sensitive to the slope of the spectral energy distribution of the stars in the system .",
    "the fluctuations are also larger the fewer post ms stars there are in the system . as their number increases , not only do the color fluctuations decrease but the mean colors get redder as well . as may be seen from fig .",
    "3 , the stochastic effects are always more significant than variations due to changes in the imf slope for the range studied here except for the young ssp when the number of post ms stars gets to be 100  then ( @xmath59 ) is larger for @xmath57 than it is for steeper values of the imf slope .",
    "relative flux contributions from ms and post ms stars for well - populated ssps with 100 post ms stars are plotted for the 3 slopes of the imf in fig .",
    "4 . for the young ssp ( left side of the fig .",
    "4 ) the @xmath19 flux contribution is distributed between the ms turnoff ( b type stars ) and the supergiantes , with insignificant contribution coming from the lower ms .",
    "as @xmath31 increases from -0.5 to 2 , the ms turnoff @xmath19 contribution increases from 40% to 60% , while the supergiants one decreases from 60% to 30% .",
    "the supergiants dominate the integrated @xmath2 bands for all imf slopes , followed by the ms turnoff , which contributes , at most , with 15% of the near - ir light .",
    "for the older ssp ( right side of fig .",
    "4 ) the @xmath19 flux contribution is distributed again between the ms turnoff ( types a and f ) and the post ms stars .",
    "as @xmath31 increases from -0.5 to 2 , the turnoff ( a+f stars ) @xmath19 contribution increases from 53% to 65% , while the giants one decreases from 45% to 30% . differently from the young ssp , there is a significant contribution in the near - ir bands from the turnoff : as @xmath31 increases from -0.5 to 2 , a and f stars together increase their contribution to @xmath62 and @xmath18 from 20% to 27% , the contribution in @xmath63 reaching 40% .",
    "the giants contribute with 80% ( @xmath57 ) to 60% ( @xmath64 ) in @xmath62 and @xmath18 and with 72% ( @xmath57 ) to 53% ( @xmath64 ) in @xmath63 .",
    "we can compare these results with that found for an old ( @xmath6510gyr ) stellar population ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for such a population , evolving dwarfs , subgiants and k giants dominate the @xmath66 and @xmath19 integrated light , regardless of the imf . in @xmath2",
    "the m giants are the largest single contributors to the flux . for @xmath32 their contribution",
    "reaches 50% of the total @xmath18 band light and is greater still for @xmath67 . in connection with the present study ,",
    "frogel s models show the relative importance of red giants in the integrated light of composite systems that contain an older stellar component , and whose contribution can change from @xmath19 to @xmath18 by significant amount",
    ".    subsequent analysis ( section 5 ) shows that the inclusion of the tp - agb can influence significantly the integrated colors in the case of the ssp with @xmath68 .",
    "for the whole range of ages ( @xmath0 ) ssps were computed in steps of @xmath69 .",
    "the behavior of the integrated ( @xmath60 ) color as a function of @xmath70 for ssps with different total masses and imf slope @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "5 . panel ( a ) shows the color evolution of ssps with @xmath71 and @xmath28 stars ; it is also shown the percentage of post ms stars for each age ( = npms/(n.100 ) ) .",
    "when ssps of identical total number of stars are compared , they can be associated to the evolution of a single star cluster . however , young clusters with a small number of stars are more difficult to interpret in terms of evolution since their post ms may be underrepresented , which produces large fluctuations in the integrated colors .",
    "5a shows that :    * less massive clusters with @xmath71 stars present a gradual reddening as they age . * young massive clusters with @xmath28 stars",
    "can have integrated ( j - k ) as red as those of older clusters . *",
    "young star clusters have integrated near - ir colors very sensitive to their masses .",
    "* older star clusters of different masses have small spread in color .    in fig .",
    "5b the color evolution is presented for ssps with a fixed number of post ms stars .",
    "the main difference between systems with npms=100 and npms=500 is the smaller color fluctuations for the last ones , the mean color having similar behavior to that of the more massive ssps with n@xmath72 stars ( see fig .",
    "well - populated ssps with at least 100 post ms stars have their integrated colors modulate by a combination of factors like the ratio between the number of upper ms and post ms stars and the extension in temperature of the blue loop and its luminosity compared to the asymptotic giant branch and to the ms turnoff .    for @xmath32 ,",
    "color fluctuations of 10% ( @xmath73 from the mean ) are reached when there are 70 post ms stars for @xmath54 , 80 for @xmath74 , 350 for @xmath75 and 40 for @xmath55 .",
    "the larger the number of post ms stars , the smaller the color fluctuations .",
    "the extended e - agb at age @xmath75 is the main feature responsible for the largest fluctuations in the integrated color of that ssp compared to the other ages .",
    "6 presents the evolution of the @xmath1 flux contribution of ms and post ms stars to the integrated light of ssps built with @xmath32 and 100 post ms stars . in summary ,",
    "the results indicated :    * in @xmath19 , as the age increases from @xmath54 to 8.25 the ms b stars contribution gets between 55% and 63% , while the post ms contribution decreases from 40% to 25% . the contribution of redder ms spectral types being less than 15% . * for @xmath75 ms b , ms a stars and post ms stars share most of the total integrated @xmath19 light , contributing with 40% , 27% and 23% respectively .",
    "the major contributors for the @xmath19 light of older ssps change dramatically : for @xmath76 , the post ms contribution increases from 25% to 35% , the ms a stars decrease strongly their contribution from 60% to 0% while the ms f ones increase theirs from 10% to 55% . * in @xmath62 and @xmath18 , the post ms contribution dominates throughly the near - ir integrated light from @xmath6590% ( at @xmath54 ) to @xmath6570% ( at @xmath77 )",

    "we compare the integrated color models and their fluctuations to the integrated colors of large magellanic cloud clusters ( from @xcite ) in fig .",
    "7a . regarding the age spread of the models computed",
    ", they are in principle adequate for a comparison with clusters of swb types ranging from ii to v. however , in most of the cases , the models are not expected to encompass clusters with swb type iv and v because the stellar evolution models do not take into account evolution beyond the e - agb for intermediate mass stars , where bright agbs like carbon stars can contribute significantly to the integrated light of a cluster .",
    "frogel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) analyzed the agb contribution to the integrated light of magellanic cloud clusters .",
    "they show that carbon stars ( originated by tp - agb stars ) are only found in clusters of swb types iv - vi and account for 50% to 100% of the bolometric luminosity from the agb above the rgb tip ( he - flash ) .",
    "the same type of stars contribute with 30% to the bolometric luminosity of a cluster with age around 2gyr ( swb v - vi ) , the whole agb ( @xmath80 ) contributing with 40% .",
    "the agreement between the younger ssp models with clusters of types swb ii and iii in the color - color diagram of fig .",
    "7a is indicating that the isochrones are essentially complete for ages around @xmath54 .",
    "more importantly , the small scatter of clusters around the younger ssp models indicates that their integrated colors are compatible with ssps showing an almost continuous imf , since big fluctuations in color are not needed to explain the young cluster distribution .",
    "it seems that the inclusion of the tp - agb phase in the stellar evolution models would improve the older ssp integrated colors , matching the observations .    in order to address the aforementioned point ,",
    "the influence of the tp - agb on the integrated colors was evaluated quantitatively by complementing the isochrones with the upper agb semi - empirical models of @xcite , which consider that stars with initial masses in the range @xmath81 will pass through that phase .",
    "the bc@xmath82  @xmath83  ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath84  @xmath83  @xmath85 relationships in @xcite together with the agb tip near - ir colors for lmc clusters observed by @xcite were used .",
    "the tp - agb has a maximum extension for the isochrone with @xmath68 , for which it spans @xmath86 and @xmath87 . on the observational side the corresponding values are @xmath88 , @xmath89(@xmath59)=3.2 and @xmath89(@xmath60)=1.3 .",

    "ssps with three values of the expected integrated v flux are presented and provide an useful tool for comparison with stellar systems of different sizes .    indeed ,",
    "when the tp - agb is taken into account , the near - ir integrated color models fit satisfactorily the observed colors of lmc clusters as shown in figure 7b .",
    "in particular , the @xmath68 ssp with @xmath90 and imf slope @xmath32 ( table 7 ) give an excelent match to the locus of the reddest lmc clusters in fig . 7b .    in order to check the sensitivity of the integrated colors on the bolometric correction and temperature scale adopted ,",
    "that information as provided by @xcite for the agb in the galactic bulge was used to build ssps of @xmath68 .",

    "the present work indicated the importance of stochastic effects on the near - ir integrated colors of young and intermediate age ssps .",
    "if integrated observations of galaxies can be represented by a mixture of integrated colors of ssps as those analyzed here , then it is clear that studies of stellar populations in galaxies must take into account the influence of bright and scarce stars on their integrated light , which can affect significantly determinations of age and metallicity .",
    "combining independent estimates ( other than by integrated light observations ) of age and metallicity for a given galaxy with its integrated colors would allow one , by using the present technique , to quantify how important are the stochastic effects for that particular stellar population .",
    "we show that the inclusion of the tp - agb phase for intermediate mass stars in the stellar evolution models by means of the semi - empirical approach presented here brought the integrated near - ir colors of intermediate age ssps in excelent agreement with the spread of observed colors of lmc clusters as far as the stochastic variations are considered .",
    "this result reflect the expected fact that the mean integrated colors are redder and subject to higher fluctuations than those generated from stellar evolution models without the tp - agb phase .",
    "* near - infrared bands combined to the optical @xmath19 band are useful tools to the investigation of the red stellar population and its stochastic fluctuation in star clusters and , consequently , in more complex systems like galaxies . * the @xmath1 integrated colors of ssps , when compared to those of lmc star clusters , gave information on the importance of taking into account tp - agbs like carbon stars in the stellar evolution models . *",
    "the importance of stochastic fluctuations in the integrated @xmath1 light of star clusters has been confirmed in this analysis , corroborating studies in the visible spectral range ; specifically , general properties derived from the integrated light of composite stellar populations must account for the influence of stars undergoing fast yet bright evolutionary stages .",

    "<S> in this paper we examine the influence of stochastic effects on the integrated near - infrared light of star clusters with ages between @xmath0 . to do this , we use stellar evolution models and a monte carlo technique to simulate the effects of stochastic variations in the numbers of main sequence , giant , and supergiant stars for single - generation stellar populations ( ssps ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations in the integrated light produced by such variations are evaluated for the @xmath1 bands . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the @xmath1 light of the star clusters can be strongly affected by plausible stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of bright but scarce stars . in particular , the inclusion of thermally pulsing agb stars in the stellar evolution models yields integrated colors with values in agreement with the spread seen for large magellanic cloud clusters that are known to have significant number of agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> implications of this analysis are important for studies of the integrated light of stellar populations where it is not possible to resolve individual stars . </S>"
