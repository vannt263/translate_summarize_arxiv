    "modelling the mass distribution of m31 is a classical problem that has seen many past iterations ( e.g. , einasto 1972 ; kent , huchra & stauffer 1989 ; klypin , zhoa & somerville 2002 ; widrow , perrett & suyu 2003 ; geehan et al.2006 ) .",
    "recently , a spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m mosaic image of m31 has become available ( barmby et al .",
    "this allows for a more accurate determination of the baryonic mass distribution in m31 than has been determined previously .",
    "accurate mass modelling of m31 is an important tool for both exploring our ideas of cosmology , and for understanding the dynamics of newly discovered local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , majewski et al .  2007 ; chapman et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "because m31 can be studied in exquisite detail , it provides a crucial testing ground for our ideas of galaxy formation ( kent 1989 ; evans & wilkinson 2000 ) .",
    "a problem of particular relevance for cosmological constant plus cold dark matter ( @xmath3cdm ) cosmology is the tully - fisher zero - point problem , which refers to the fact that standard models can not reproduce the relation between galaxy luminosity and circular velocity ( tully & fisher 1977 ) without over - producing the number density of galaxies at fixed luminosity ( e.g.   gonzalez et al .",
    "2000 ; cole et al .  2000 ; benson et al .  2003 ; yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ) .",
    "another problem of related concern is the cusp / concentration problem  namely that dark - matter dominated galaxy rotation curves seem to rise more slowly than predicted in @xmath3cdm ( moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ; moore et al .  1999 ; van den bosch & swaters 2001 ; blais - ouellette , amram & carignan 2001 ; alam , bullock & weinberg 2002 ; swaters et al .  2003 ; simon et al .  2005 ;",
    "dutton et al .",
    "2005 ; kuzio de naray et al .  2006 ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these problems point to some unaccounted for process in galaxy formation ( e.g.  dutton et al .",
    "2007 ) or to some new physics of cosmological relevance ( kaplinghat , knox & turner 2000 ; zentner & bullock 2002 ; kaplinghat 2005 ; cembranos et al .   2005 ; strigari , kaplinghat & bullock 2007 ; gnedin et al .  2007 ) .",
    "recently , dutton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and gnedin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) revisited the tully - fisher problem using two large well - defined samples of disc - dominated ( late - type ) galaxies .",
    "they both took as a starting point the `` standard '' model of disc formation , which assumes that initial navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) dark haloes respond to disc formation via adiabatic contraction ( ac ) ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2004 ; sellwood & mcgaugh 2005 ; choi et al .",
    "both groups conclude that the tully - fisher zero point can not be explained if initial nfw haloes have concentrations as high as those expected for @xmath3cdm with @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 for m31-size haloes , e.g.  bullock et al .",
    "2001a , macci et al .  2006 ) .",
    "both sets of authors agree that the problem could be alleviated if ac did not operate ( e.g.  somerville & primack 1999 ) and dutton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) go on to advocate a model where disc formation induces an _ expansion _ in the underlying halo density structure .",
    "in contrast , gnedin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that ac is a fundamental prediction in galaxy formation and instead suggest that the cosmology be changed to favor lower halo concentrations ( e.g. zentner & bullock 2002 ) or that the imf is lighter ( with a stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath9 lower by 0.15 dex ) than the standard kroupa ( 2001 ) assumption .    given the fundamental issues at hand , the question of whether ac occurs in nature is of significant interest .",
    "theory certainly favours the idea that haloes contract . indeed",
    ", halo contraction must occur when the infall of baryons is smooth and adiabatic ( e.g.   blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; ryden & gunn 1987 ; sellwood & mcgaugh 2005 ) and simulations suggest that dark haloes will contract even when galaxies or galaxy clusters form quickly from an irregular collapse ( barnes 1987 ; flores et al .",
    "1993 ; jesseit , naab & burkert 2002 ; gnedin et al .",
    "2004 ; sellwood & mcgaugh 2005 ; choi et al .",
    "2006 ; weinberg et al .",
    "2008 ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is very little observational evidence that halo contraction actually occurs in nature .",
    "for example , zappacosta et al .  ( 2006 ) performed a detailed xmm study of the radio - quiet galaxy cluster abell 2589 and conclude that an nfw halo + ac model can not explain the data but that a pure nfw halo provides a remarkable fit down to @xmath10 of the halo s virial radius .",
    "similarly , an investigation of seven elliptical galaxies with _ chandra _ by the same group ( humphrey et al .",
    "2006 ) finds that ac degrades the mass profile fits significantly unless strong deviations from a kroupa imf are allowed .",
    "also , kassin , de jong & pogge ( 2006a ) and kassin , de jong & weiner ( 2006b ) found that the rotation curves of 32 out of 34 of the bright spiral galaxies they study are better fit without adiabatic contraction .",
    "klypin et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have shown that the observed rotation curve of m31 is best explained with a halo model that includes ac . however , other recent m31 mass modelling papers ( e.g. , widrow et al .  2003 ; geehan et al .",
    "2006 ) have not directly addressed the question of ac .",
    "furthermore , m31 is essentially the only well - studied galaxy that has been shown to require ac ( klypin et al .  2002 ) .",
    "most other dynamical studies of galaxies tend to disfavour ac ( e.g. , kassin et al .",
    "2006a , b ) . given the availability of a spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m image , it is now appropriate to revisit this question and test the conclusion that m31 requires ac . in what follows",
    "we show that the rotation curve of m31 can only be explained without ac if an unusually high nfw concentration , @xmath11 , is adopted .",
    "such a concentration is well outside the range expected in @xmath3cdm haloes , and therefore this model is disfavoured .",
    "moreover , the best - fit ac model has a slightly high nfw concentration , @xmath4 , for typical , @xmath12 , @xmath3cdm haloes ( bullock et al .",
    "2001a , macci et al .  2006 ) , but it is within 1.5@xmath13 of the expected value for an m31 size halo .",
    "we speculate on the implications of these results in the conclusion section .",
    "our approach is unique compared to other recently published mass profiles derived from modelling the rotation curve of m31 . while our method bears most similarity to",
    "that adopted by klypin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we use an updated baryonic mass component , which is derived using a 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer image .",
    "geehan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used a pure nfw halo profile , and did not consider ac .",
    "tempel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also use the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer image , yet once again , ac is not considered .",
    "lastly , widrow et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used a different functional form for the halo density profile ( see evans 1993 ) .",
    "the evans profile is based upon an isothermal distribution function . unlike the nfw profile",
    ", the evans profile was not derived by fitting models to dark matter haloes produced in @xmath3cdm simulations .",
    "widrow et al .",
    "( 2003 ) then go on to fit an nfw model to their best - fitting evans ( 1993 ) model .",
    "however , we have chosen to use the cosmologically motivated nfw halo density profile model directly .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat @xmath3cdm cosmology with @xmath14 and a hubble constant of @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "we relate virial masses ( @xmath17 ) and radii ( @xmath18 ) assuming a virial over - density relative to _ average _ of @xmath19 kpc . ] . at times",
    "we quote baryon fractions relative to the universal value with @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt a distance of 784 kpc to m31 ( holland 1998 ) . as a result ,",
    "an angular distance of @xmath21 is equivalent to a distance of 228 pc .",
    "we make use of the spitzer / irac 3.6 @xmath0 m image of m31 ( barmby et al .   2006 ) .",
    "the irac observations of m31 were taken as part of _ spitzer _ general observer program 3126 in 2005 august .",
    "fifteen astronomical observation requests ( aors ) were used to map a region approximately @xmath22 on the sky .",
    "the central @xmath23 was covered by three aors , each having two 12 s frames per position .",
    "the outer regions were covered by two aors , each with two dithered 30 s frames per position .",
    "the pixel scale of irac at 3.6 @xmath0 m is 1.221 arcsec , with a point spread function ( psf ) that has a fwhm @xmath241.2 arcsec .",
    "the 3.6 @xmath0 m filter is 1.2 @xmath0 m broad , spanning the wavelengths 2.9654.165 @xmath0 m . for a description of the irac instrument see fazio et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the spitzer data are preferred over 2mass @xmath25-band data for a few reasons .",
    "the regular 2mass @xmath25-band image is simply not deep enough to obtain an accurate bulge / disc decomposition .",
    "furthermore , this same 2mass image suffers from over subtraction of the sky by about 0.5 magnitudes ( t.  jarrett , private communication ) .",
    "a 6@xmath26 2mass @xmath25-band image is also available ( where the data were observed with an integration time 6 times longer than the regular 2mass survey ) , but it is only about 1 magnitude deeper and also hampered by uncertain sky background .",
    "the spitzer image has a larger field of view , better depth , and a more accurate determination of the sky level .",
    "we also use the @xmath1 colour profile of walterbos & kennicutt ( 1987 ) , in order to determine the stellar mass - to - light ratio as a function of radius .",
    "we have corrected this @xmath1 profile has for galactic foreground extinction , which is @xmath27 mags in the direction of m31 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) .",
    "this is converted to a correction for the @xmath1 colour by using the transformation , @xmath28 from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , i.e.  @xmath29 for m31 . as a comparison",
    "the amount of extinction at 3.6 @xmath0 m is 1.5 per cent of that at @xmath30 , and about 34 per cent of that in the @xmath25 band .",
    "we adopt the rotation curve data from several sources . in one case ( m1 )",
    "we adopt the h@xmath31 rotation data out to 25 kpc from rubin & ford ( 1970 ) @xmath326583 emission feature , for the region within 3 kpc . however , these velocities are not tabulated in their paper , and so we do not include them here . ] and extend the rotation curve to 35 kpc using hi data from carignan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in another case",
    "( m2 ) we use the co rotational velocities from loinard , allen & lequeux ( 1995 ) and the hi from brinks & burton ( 1984 ) to construct an observed rotation curve out to a 30 kpc radius .",
    "this was the rotation curve adopted by klypin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in their m31 model .",
    "we adopt m1 as our fiducial case here because rubin & ford published errors on their observed velocities .",
    "however , as we show below , both cases yield consistent results . in both cases",
    "we take into account the presence of a @xmath33 supermassive black hole ( bender et al .",
    "2005 ) and the hi gas distribution ( carignan et al .",
    "our goal is to determine the best possible mass model for m31 .",
    "we perform a bulge - disc decomposition in order to estimate the baryonic contribution to the rotation curve .",
    "we then determine several possible mass models .",
    "the best fit model is determined by minimizing the reduced-@xmath34 in a fit to the observed rotation curve .",
    "we first extract the surface brightness profile of m31 using the spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m image and the iraf ellipse routine , which fits ellipses to an image using an iterative method described by jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) . in order to mask out foreground stars and satellite galaxies sextractor (",
    "bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was used .",
    "an inclination correction was then applied to the surface brightness profile ( see de jong 1996 ; seigar & james 1998a ) as follows @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the surface brightness when viewed at some inclination , @xmath37 , @xmath0 is the corrected surface brightness , @xmath38 is the major axis , @xmath39 is the minor axis and @xmath40 is a factor dependent on whether the galaxy is optically thick or thin ; if @xmath41 then the galaxy is optically thin ; if @xmath42 then the galaxy is optically thick .",
    "since we are using infrared data , the correction for inclination is small , and in many cases completely ignored ( see e.g.seigar & james 1998a ; de jong 1996 ) .",
    "however , graham ( 2001 ) showed that @xmath43 is a good typical value to use for the near - infrared @xmath25-band . if one adopts a simple reddening law , where extinction falls as the square of wavelength , then the value of @xmath44 is appropriate at 3.6 @xmath0 m , and we adopt this value here .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profile ( figure 1 ) reaches a surface brightness of @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath46 at a radius of @xmath47 .",
    "this is very similar to the surface brightness found by barmby et al .",
    "furthermore , the pne counts of merrett et al .",
    "( 2006 ) predict an r band surface brightness of @xmath48 mag arcsec@xmath46 . at these radii",
    "the metallicity of m31 is @xmath49 ( brewer , richer & crabtree 1995 ; worthey et al .",
    "2005 ) . using the maraston ( 2005 ) population synthesis codes",
    ", one can see that the expected @xmath50[3.6 ] color at this radius is @xmath50[3.6]@xmath242.5 , very similar to our measured surface brightness .    from this surface brightness profile",
    ", we perform a one - dimensional bulge - disc decomposition , which employs the srsic model for the bulge component and an exponential law for the disc component ( e.g.  andredakis et al .  1995 ; seigar & james 1998a ; khosroshahi , wadadekar & kembhavi 2000 ; donofrio 2001 ; graham 2001b ; mllenhoff & heidt 2001 ; see also graham & driver 2005 for a review ) .",

    "the constant @xmath55 is defined in terms of the parameter @xmath56 , which describes the overall shape of the light profile .",
    "when @xmath57 the srsic model is equivalent to a de vaucouleurs ( 1948 , 1959 ) @xmath58 model and when @xmath59 it is equivalent to an exponential model .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 has been approximated by @xmath60 , for @xmath61 ( capaccioli 1989 ; prugniel & simien 1997 ) . the exponential model for the disc surface brightness profile can be written as follows , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the disc central surface brightness and @xmath64 is the disc scale length .",
    "our bulge - disc decomposition ignores the inner @xmath65 of m31 , which is dominated by an independent nuclear feature ( light , danielson & schwarschild 1974 ) .",
    "the results of the bulge - disc decomposition can be seen in figure [ sb ] .",
    "note that although there appears to be a slight break in the disc surface brightness profile at @xmath244000@xmath66 , the residuals are still very small .",
    "this break may appear due to the presence of spiral structure , evident at similar radii in the 24 @xmath0 m of m31 .",

    "below , where we assign a mass to the disc , we extrapolate the disc profile to 6 scalelengths , which would contain 98.2 per cent of the disc light .",
    "since ibata et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that the disc of m31 extends to very large radii ( @xmath2470 kpc ) with the same scalelength , our above calculation assumes no disc truncation . both the 10 kpc ring and the 2.6 kpc bar ( beaton et al .",
    "2007 ) show up as small perturbations in the surface brightness profile ( fig .",
    "1 ) at radii of 46.67@xmath68 and 26.67@xmath68 respectively .",
    "we now assign masses to the disc and bulge of m31 .",
    "the stellar mass - to - light ratio in the @xmath25-band is a well calibrated quantity ( see bell et al .",
    "2003 ) which depends on @xmath1 colour .",
    "however , a similar calibration does not exist for the spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m waveband .",
    "an alternative method would be to estimate the @xmath25-band surface brightness profile , given the 3.6 @xmath0 m profile , and since we know the @xmath1 colour profile , we have chosen to determine the @xmath69[3.6 ] colour dependence on @xmath1 colour using both the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ; hereafter bc03 ) stellar population synthesis models and the maraston ( 2005 ; hereafter m05 ) stellar population synthesis models .",
    "the bc03 models use the stellar library of pickles ( 1998 ) , which includes stars in a wide range of spectral types ( 05-m10 ) and luminosity classes ( i - v ) and three metallicity groups ( metal poor , metal rich and solar ) .",
    "the pickles ( 1998 ) library has wavelength coverage from 0.1 @xmath0 m to 2.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "basel 3.1 spectra ( see bc03 tables 2 and 3 ) are then used to extend the pickles ( 1998 ) spectra into the infrared from 2.5 @xmath0 m to 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "the spectra of m giant stars are the only ones not observed in the pickles ( 1998 ) library . as a result the bc03 models use synthetic m giant spectra calculated by fluks et al .",
    "these spectra are extended into the infrared using the model atmospheres of schultheis et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which cover a spectral range from 0.5 @xmath0 m to 10 @xmath0 m , and 10 equally spaced stellar temperatures in the range @xmath70 k. the main difference between the bc03 and the m05 models is the way in which thermally - pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) stars are treated .",
    "the m05 models provide a better treatment of tp - agb stars than the bc03 models . furthermore , maraston et al .",
    "( 2006 ) find that in general the m05 models provide better fits to observations of infrared spectra of galaxies than the bc03 models .",
    "they indicate systematically lower ages and , on average , masses that are 60 per cent lower for the stellar population samples in these galaxies .",
    "figure [ synphot ] shows the result of both the bc03 ( _ left panel _ ) and m05 ( _ right panel _ ) models . in both cases ,",
    "the dotted lines in figure [ synphot ] represent the @xmath1 colour of the inner and outer disc of m31 ( walterbos & kennicutt 1987 and figure [ colour ] ) after correction for galactic foreground extinction .",
    "since the m05 models provide an updated treatment of tp - agb stars and generally provide better fits to observations than the bc03 models , from here on we concentrate on the m05 results .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the @xmath69[3.6 ] colour index predicted by the bc03 and m05 models differs by @xmath710.03 mag ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "lines of constant metallicity ( solid lines ) and age ( dashed lines ) are shown .",
    "the typical metallicity in the inner few kpc of m31 is @xmath242.4 @xmath72 , whereas in the outer disc this falls to @xmath240.4 @xmath72 ( brewer , richer & crabtree 1995 ; worthey et al .",
    "2005 ) . from this metallicity gradient and the m05 models ( figure [ synphot ]",
    "_ right panel _ )",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath1 colour gradient in m31 is almost entirely due to changes in metallicity , and that the @xmath69[3.6 ] colour difference is @xmath73 mag .",
    "furthermore , we can now use the @xmath1 gradient ( figure [ colour ] ) and the metallicity gradient of m31 to estimate the @xmath69[3.6 ] colour as a function of radius .",
    "we find that the inner region of m31 has a colour @xmath69[3.6]@xmath74 , and the outer disc ( at 26 kpc ) has a colour @xmath69[3.6]@xmath75 .",
    "given the @xmath1 colour profile and the k - band mass - to - light ratio calibration from bell et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we calculate a central mass - to - light ratio , @xmath76 and a mass - to - light ratio at 26 kpc , @xmath77 .",
    "from the @xmath69[3.6 ] colours determined in our stellar population synthesis analysis , the above mass - to - light ratios are equivalent to 3.6 @xmath0 m mass - to - light ratios of @xmath78 in the centre and @xmath79 at 26 kpc ( equivalent to a @xmath80 gradient 0.13 kpc@xmath16 ) . in our analysis , we prefer to keep the central @xmath81 value a free parameter , and as such we allow it to vary in the range @xmath82 .",
    "this is a standard approach to adopt in mass modelling of galaxies ( see humphrey et al .",
    "2006 ; zappacosta et al .",
    "2006 ) and as discussed at the end of section 3.2 and shown in table 2 , when the @xmath83 is left as a free parameter , the best - fit value found is @xmath84 , i.e.  consistent with the value of @xmath83 derived here .",
    "we use our derived value for the 3.6 @xmath0 m disc luminosity of @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "we then use the derived disc and bulge light profiles @xmath87 to determine the stellar mass contribution to the rotation curve , @xmath88 .    a concern in using the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer waveband to determine the underlying stellar mass , is the effect of emission from hot dust in this waveband , although this is probably only important in or near hii regions . in order to place some constraint on this ,",
    "we have chosen to explore the emission from dust in the the near - infared @xmath89-band at 2.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "using near - infrared spectroscopy at 2.2 @xmath0 m it has been shown that hot dust can account for up to 30 per cent of the continuum light observed at this wavelength in areas of active star formation , i.e. , spiral arms ( james & seigar 1999 ) . when averaged over the entire disc of a galaxy , this reduces to a @xmath712 per cent effect , if one assumes that spiral arms can be up to 12@xmath90 in width . at 3.6 @xmath0 m",
    "this would therefore result in @xmath713 per cent of emitted light from dust .",
    "another concern for the 3.6 @xmath0 m waveband , would be the contribution from the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature at 3.3 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , iso spectra covering the wavelength range 5.15 to 16.5 @xmath0 m have shown that pah emission in m31 seems to be very weak ( e.g. , cesarsky et al .",
    "1998 ) . furthermore , in a survey of actively star forming galaxies ,",
    "helou et al .  ( 2000 ) found that the 3.3 @xmath0 m feature was also very weak when they analysed the average @xmath91 @xmath0 m spectrum of 45 galaxies .",
    "the contribution of the pah feature to the 3.6 @xmath0 m spitzer waveband , is therefore not a major concern .    in the following section , where we model the dark matter halo , we have included a bulge surface brightness model using a deprojected srsic function",
    "the function we use is from trujillo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who show that the deprojected mass density profile is given by , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the effective radius , @xmath94 is the central intensity , @xmath95 is the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the @xmath99-order modified bessel function of the third kind .",
    "trujillo et al .  ( 2002 ) give values for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 for different values of the srsic parameter , @xmath56 . in our case , where @xmath105 , we adopt values of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "finally , the constant @xmath111 depends on the three - dimensional spatial orientation of the bulge . in our case , we assume the bulge is intrinsically spherical , and therefore @xmath112 .",
    "it should be noted that this version of the deprojected srsic function ( equation [ dep ] ) is an approximation , but it is good enough for our purposes .",
    "a range of allowed dark matter halo masses and density profiles are now explored , using two models for disc galaxy formation . in the first we assume that the dark matter halo surrounding m31 has not responded significantly to the formation of the disc ,",
    "i.e. , adiabatic contraction does not occur ( the `` no - ac '' model ) . in this case",
    "the dark matter contribution to the rotation curve is described by a density profile similar to those found in dissipationless dark matter simulations ( the nfw profile ) : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a characteristic `` inner '' radius , and @xmath115 is a corresponding inner density .",

    "we have chosen to assume a srsic law for the bulge and we then perform a mass - to - light conversion . in our approach , we essentially ignore any kinematics within the inner few kpc , because in that region the kinematics are likely to be perturbed by the bar or affected by streaming motions along the bar .",

    "figure 4 shows that the bar kinematics are strongest within the inner @xmath246 kpc . beyond 10 kpc ,",

    "( 2006 ) derives a bulge mass of @xmath180 @xmath126 , very similar to our bulge mass .",
    "we note that the bulge component in our models is less concentrated than that derived by some other groups .",
    "klypin et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have a more concentrated bulge , but that is probably due to a combination of the fact that they use a hernquist model ( equivalent to a srsic index of @xmath57 ) for the m31 bulge and optical data to determine the bulge characteristics .",
    "geehan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also use a hernquist model .",
    "this type of model will naturally produce a more concentrated bulge than a srsic model with index @xmath181 .",

    "it is also interesting to note that replacing our srsic bulge with a bulge profile modelled using a hernquist or exponential law does not affect the overall dark matter halo profile by more than 10 per cent .",
    "this may be because the overall bulge mass does not change ; it is just the way in which the bulge mass is distrbuted that changes .",
    "the issue of turbulent gas motions is very important for low - mass galaxies with small rotation velocities ( e.g. , valenzuela et al .",

    "we use the h@xmath31 rotation velocities of rubin & ford ( 1970 ) .",
    "however , we find that this is not the major driver .",

    "we allow @xmath80 to vary freely in the range @xmath191 , and find a best - fitting value close to the expected 3.6 @xmath0 m mass - to - light ratios ( see section [ bruzual ] ) .",
    "possibly the most significant difference is that klypin et al .",

    "2000 ) and the andromeda stream ( fardal et al .  2006 ; geehan et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the lower limit of @xmath204 found from kinematics of halo stars ( chapman et al .",
    "our m1 b86 model , which is in closest agreement with the expectations of @xmath3cdm , lies in the middle of the range with a virial mass of @xmath205 .",
    "another recent m31 mass model by tamm , tempel & tenjes ( 2007 ) and tempel , tamm & tenjes ( 2007 ) also uses spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m imaging to determine the total mass of m31 , and they find a mass of @xmath206 for a pure nfw model , i.e.a slightly higher mass than for our best fit .",
    "however , they did not look at the question of ac . also , their bulge seems to have a more concentrated density profile ( see figure 6 in tempel et al .  2007 ) , which is probably driven by the use of rotation velocities inside 5 kpc .",
    "this may be driving the differences between our model and the model presented in tempel et al .",
    "we have been cautious not to include rotation data within the inner few kpc in our model , since it is unlcear how non - circular motions induced in this barred region will affect the overall mass model .",
    "it is interesting that , while it has been shown that adiabatically contracted halo models do not generally fit the observed rotation curves of galaxies ( e.g.  dutton et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 ; kassin et al .",
    "2006a , b ; pizagno et al .",
    "2005 ) , the observed rotation curve of a well - studied galaxy such as m31 can be well described by a halo that has undergone adiabatic contraction .",
    "indeed , one either has to adopt _",
    "( i ) _ a pure nfw profile with an unphysically large concentration , within the context of @xmath3cdm , or _",
    "( ii ) _ an adiabatically contracted nfw profile and a more reasonable concentration .",
    "such a scenario is in agreement with the results of klypin et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who claim that an adiabatically contracted halo is favoured for m31 .    much of the power in this analysis came from including the normalization _ and _ outer slope of m31 s rotation curve in our fits ( where many similar studies of ac attempt to fit to just the rotation velocity at 2.2 disc scalelengths , @xmath118 ) .",
    "this highlights the usefulness of extended rotation curve data in constraining general models of galaxy formation .",
    "having rotation curve data out to large radii is essential for determining dark matter density profiles .",
    "studies that test the applicability of adiabatic contraction often make use of large samples of galaxies that are dominated by late - type disc - dominated galaxies , with small bulges or no bulge at all ( e.g.  pizagno et al .",
    "2005 ; dutton et al .  2005 , 2007 ;",
    "gnedin et al .",
    "2006 ; kassin et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "these `` bulgeless '' galaxies also tend to have very flat ( or even rising ) rotation curves , and it is therefore easy to explain these galaxy rotation curves without any need for adiabatic contraction .",
    "however , we suggest that early - type disc galaxies ( e.g.  hubble types sa  sb ) , which have bulge - dominated centres , and rotation curves that fall - off due to the presence of a large bulge , may require adiabatic contraction .",
    "although we have studied very few galaxies so far ( m31 in this paper and two other galaxies in seigar et al .",
    "2006 ) our results indicate that in cases where rotation curves have a fall - off ( two out of three cases ) , adiabatic contraction is favoured",
    ". this may be true for all galaxies with large bulges .",
    "if so , it may favour a secular ( rather than merger - driven ) origin for these bulge - dominated systems , as the gradual accumulation of central mass increases the likelihood that ac will operate .",
    "it should also be noted that in our best - fit model , while it is consistent with the current hi data from carignan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , it is unclear if the rotation curve is declining or remaining flat past 30 kpc , due to the large error bars .",
    "the most important requirement for future kinematical studies of galaxies would be improved hi measurements at large radii .",
    "this will enable us to put better constraints on the halo properties of m31 and other spiral galaxies .",

    "because m31 is a highly inclined galaxy , it is difficult to learn how tightly wound its spiral arm pattern is from imaging data .",
    "however , seigar , block & puerari ( 2004 ) and seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) have shown that there is a very tight correlation between the spiral arm pitch angle ( i.e.  how tightly wound the spiral arms are ) and rotation curve shear ( measured at a 10 kpc radius ) .",
    "therefore the spiral arm pitch angle can be estimated from the shear measured for the m31 rotation curve .",
    "rotation curve shear is defined as @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the first oort constant , @xmath209 is the angular velocity and @xmath210 is the rotational velocity at radius @xmath192 .",
    "the shear rate depends upon the shape of the rotation curve . for a rotation curve that remains flat the shear rate , @xmath211 , for a falling rotation curve the shear rate , @xmath212 and for a continually rising rotation curve the shear rate , @xmath213 . following the method described by seigar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we measure the shear at a 10 kpc radius .",
    "for m31 , 10 kpc is equivalent to @xmath214 .",
    "the shear is measured using the prescription described by seigar ( 2005 ) and seigar et al .",
    "( 2004 , 2005 , 2006 ) . in this method",
    "an average slope is fit to the outer part of the rotation curve ( i.e. , past the solid - body rotation regime ) , and the shear is then calculated at the given radius . for m31 , at a radius of 10 kpc , the shear is @xmath215 .",
    "there is little scatter in the correlation between shear rate and pitch angle , and the line of best fit is given by @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the spiral arm pitch angle in degrees and @xmath218 is the shear . from this the pitch angle for m31",
    "is @xmath6 .",
    "( it should be noted that the shear at 10 kpc determined for the m1 b86 model in section 2.2 is @xmath219 and for m1 g05 is @xmath220 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with the shear measured here .",
    "they result in pitch angles of @xmath221 and @xmath222 respectively , both of which are consistent with the pitch angle derived above ) .    assuming a logarithmic spiral ( see e.g. , seigar & james 1998b for the equations that define a logarithmic spiral ) , the spiral arm pattern of m31 is calculated .",
    "figure [ spiral ] shows the predicted spiral arm pattern of m31 for a face - on view ( _ left _ ) and with an inclination angle , @xmath223 , and a position angle @xmath224 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) appropriate for m31 ( _ centre _ ) .",
    "it should be noted that the position and inclination angles are not fitted parameters , they are taken from the literature .",
    "the spiral arm pitch angle calculated here is larger than the hi spiral arm pitch angle of 16@xmath90 calculated by braun ( 1991 ) , although it is possible that the spiral arm pattern in the neutral gas may be a few degrees tighter than that observed in the underlying stellar distribution .",
    "a pitch angle of 16@xmath90 would be a @xmath242@xmath13 outlier in the spiral arm pitch angle versus rotation curve shear correlation when the shear , @xmath225 ( see figure 3 of seigar et al .",
    "if this point was added to the correlation , it would be one of the larger outliers , yet the correlation would still be strong . for comparison",
    "the 24 @xmath0 m image is shown in the right panel of figure [ spiral ] .",

    "<S> we present an updated mass model for m31 that makes use of a spitzer 3.6 @xmath0 m image , a mass - to - light ratio gradient based on the galaxy s @xmath1 colour profile , and observed rotation curve data from a variety of sources . </S>",
    "<S> we examine cases where the dark matter follows a pure nfw profile and where an initial nfw halo contracts adiabatically in response to the formation of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both of these scenarios can produce a reasonable fit to the observed rotation curve data . </S>",
    "<S> however , a pure nfw model requires a concentration @xmath2 that is well outside the range predicted in @xmath3cdm cosmology and is therefore disfavoured . </S>",
    "<S> an adiabatically contracted nfw halo favors an initial concentration @xmath4 and virial mass @xmath5 , and this is in line with the cosmological expectations for a galaxy of the size of m31 . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit mass is consistent with published estimates from andromeda stream kinematics , satellite galaxy radial velocities , and planetary nebulae studies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using the known linear correlation between rotation curve shear and spiral arm pitch angle , we show that the stellar spiral arm pitch angle of m31 ( which can not be deduced from imaging data due to the galaxy s inclination ) is @xmath6 .    </S>",
