    "the problem of the formation of the structures in the universe is one of the most important problem of modern extragalactic astronomy and cosmology .",
    "one of interesting aspects of this problem is the analysis of the orientation of galaxies inside the galaxy structures .",
    "the very important question is if there exists dependence on the alignment to the mass of the analyzed structures .",
    "it is because the investigation of the orientation of galaxies planes is regarded as a standard test of galaxies formation scenarios . @xcite .",
    "there was a lot of investigation of the orientations of galaxies inside clusters ( see @xcite for the latest review ) .",
    "godowski et al @xcite suggested that alignment of galaxies in cluster should increase with the number of objects in a particular cluster .",
    "that suggestion was confirmed by aryal et al .",
    "@xcite , based on the series of papers @xcite .",
    "however both @xcite and @xcite analysis were qualitative only .",
    "for this manner godowski at al .",
    "@xcite analyzed sample of 247 rich abell clusters using statistical tests and found that alignment increases with the richness of the clusters .",
    "the analysis of the orientation of galaxies in poor galaxy structures - tully groups of galaxies was performed by godowski et al .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "it was found that the group do not exhibit clear evidence for existence of alignment in the investigated structures .",
    "however they concluded , that observational effect generated by the process of deprojection of galaxies @xcite , later confirmed by @xcite , masks to the high degree any possible alignment during analysis of the spatial orientation of galaxies in clusters .",
    "for these reasons we analyzed the orientation of galaxy in tully galaxy group in more details .",
    ".test for isotropy of the orientations of galaxy plane . the distribution of the angle @xmath2 of galaxies , inclination taken directly from ngc catalog .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     at first , following godowski et al .",
    "@xcite but adding the k - s test , we analyzed orientation of galaxies in tully groups using , for obtaining @xmath0 and @xmath1 angles , inclinations angles taken directly from nbg catalog @xcite ( sample a ) .",
    "the results were presented in the tables 1 - 3 .",
    "analysis of the supergalactic position angles showed that only one group ( @xmath3 ) exhibits alignment of galaxies .",
    "analysis of the distribution of the angles giving spatial orientation of galaxies ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) seems to show weak alignment . for @xmath0 angle three tests",
    "showed that the distribution is non random in the case of the clusters @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "two tests showed nonrandomness in the case of clusters @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for @xmath1 angle three tests showed alignment in the case of clusters @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "two tests showed it in the case of clusters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    for more detailed analysis we used the method described in @xcite .",
    "the question which arose , is if we could say that we found an alignment in the analyzed sample of @xmath11 tully groups of galaxies .",
    "so we computed the mean value and variance of analyzed statistics : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( i.e. the same statistics as was analyzed in @xcite ) for our sample of @xmath11 groups and compared it with results of numerical simulations .",
    "we performed 1000 simulations of 18 fictious clusters , each with number of randomly oriented , members galaxies , the same as in real clusters . in the table 4 we present , obtained from numerical simulations average values of the analyzed statistics , their standard deviations , standard deviations in the sample as well as their standard deviations for distribution of @xmath15 angles .",
    "one should note that there are some differences in results of numerical simulations for @xmath15 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 angles but it does not change our further conclusions . the mean values and variance of analyzed statistics for sample of real clusters are presented in the table 5 . on can show that ( for sample a ) analysis of the position angles does not show significant deviation from the values expected in the case of random distributions , while it seems that analysis of angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 shows existence of alignment at the @xmath16 level ( with exception of @xmath14 statistics for @xmath0 angle ) .",
    "however , below we will argue against such interpretation .",
    "the tully groups were analyzed also by godowski and ostrowski @xcite .",
    "for every cluster the parameter @xmath17 describing the galactic axes alignment with respect to a chosen cluster pole , divided by its formal error @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) were mapped .",
    "the cluster pole coordinates change along the entire celestial sphere .",
    "the resulting maps were analyzed for correlations of their maxima with important points on the maps ( see fig.1 for details ) .",
    "it was found that maxima correlated well with the line of sight direction .",
    "godowski and ostrowski @xcite concluded that the strong systematic effect , generated by the process of galactic axis de - projection from its optical image , is present in the catalogue data .",
    "the example of that effect is presented in the fig.1 . to avoid possible influence of global alignment inside ls ,",
    "we choose for presentation the cluster @xmath9 ( ursa major cloud ) because it is far from the center of the local supercluster ( i.e. virgo cluster ) . to remove above effect we should avoid the assumption that the `` true '' axial ratio is @xmath20 , which is a rather poor approximation , especially for non - spiral galaxies .",
    "fortunately nbg catalog contains morphological types of galaxies .",
    "these allowed us to use different values of @xmath21 depending on morphological type @xcite .",
    "now , with help of fouque & paturel @xcite formulae , which convert @xmath22 to standard photometrical axial ratios , we compute new inclination angle @xmath23 for all galaxies in ngb catalog .",
    "we repeated our investigation with that `` new '' sample of galaxies ( sample b ) .",
    "as one can see from right panel of the fig.1 , the `` line of sight '' effect disappeared which shows that our procedure for computation of the inclination angles are much better than the previous one . from the tab.6 and tab.7",
    "we can show that during analysis of the spatial orientation of galaxies , the alignment is observed only in the case of @xmath1 angle for clusters @xmath4 and @xmath7 ( virgo cluster and virgo - libra cloud ) .",
    "of course our procedure does not change position angles .",
    "in the tab.8 we presented analyzes of the distribution of @xmath15 where only galaxies with the certainly measure positions angles were taken into account . on can show ( tab.5 , sample @xmath24 ) that now the mean value of analyzed statistics does not exhibit any significant deviation from the values expected in the case of random distributions .",
    "the above results allowed us to conclude that we did not observe any significant alignment for tully groups of galaxies .",
    "we investigated the orientation of galaxies inside @xmath11 tully groups of galaxies belonging to the local supercluster , do not founding any significant alignment .",
    "so we conclude that orientations of galaxies in the tully groups are random .",
    "we also analyzed observational effect generated by the process of deprojection of galaxies found by godowski and ostrowski @xcite , which masks to the high degree any possible alignment during analysis of the spatial orientation of galaxies in clusters .",
    "we showed that using `` true shape '' of galaxies @xmath21 depending on morphological type according to heidmann et al .",
    "@xcite with help of fouque & paturel @xcite corrections of @xmath22 to standard photometrical axial ratios , allowed us to avoid this problem .",
    "this gives much more powerful investigation of the spatial orientation of galaxies .    in our prvious papers we found that in the sample of @xmath25 rich abell galaxy clusters we observed an alignment , which increased with the cluster richness @xcite",
    "now , we found that the orientation of galaxies inside the poor galaxy structure is random .",
    "it confirms our suggestion that alignment of galaxies increases with the mass of the structures @xcite . usually such dependence between the angular momentum and the mass of the structure",
    "is presented as empirical relation @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the observed relation between mass of the galaxy structure and the alignment is compatible with the prediction of the li model @xcite in which galaxies are forming in the rotating universe .",
    "however , in our opinion , it is due to tidal torque , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "also the results of the analysis of the linear tidal torque theory which noticed the connection of the alignment with the considered scale of the structure is pointing in the same direction @xcite .",
