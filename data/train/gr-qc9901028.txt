    "recently gravitational collapse of scalar fields have attracted much attention after the surprising discovery of critical phenomena by choptuik@xcite .",
    "the spherically symmetric collapse of a scalar field has been extensively investigated both analytically@xcite and numerically@xcite .",
    "the critical solution often displays self - similarity such that there exists a vector field , @xmath0 , whose lie derivative of the spacetime metric satisfies @xmath1 .",
    "the first known analytic solution of this kind was found by roberts@xcite in the context of counter - examples to cosmic censorship , and later discussed by brady@xcite in connection with critical behavior .",
    "frolov@xcite extended roberts work in general spacetime dimensions .    in the work of roberts - brady - frolov@xcite they considered subcritical , critical , and supercritical solutions depending on a parameter characterizing the solutions . in the supercritical solution",
    "a black hole is formed by the collapse , and in the critical case the spacetime is asymptotically flat but contains a null , scalar - curvature singularity . in the subcritical case ,",
    "classically , the scalar field collapses , interacts and disperses leaving behind flat spacetime without forming a black hole .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the subcritical case to investigate the quantum mechanical black hole formation by tunneling .",
    "although the flux of the scalar field is not intense enough to classically form a black hole , it is possible to tunnel through the effective potential barrier and to continue collapsing to form a black hole . in the classically forbidden region",
    "we shall solve the field equations in euclidean spacetime , whereas roberts , brady , and frolov considered only spacetime with lorentzian signature .",
    "we shall show that the black hole does form in the subcritical case through the tunneling mechanism .",
    "the mass of the black hole turns out to be infinity due to the self - similar nature of the solution .",
    "but one may view the solution as a near - critical solution with a finite mass in the spacetime region of a scale much below the relevant large correlation length .    in the section",
    "ii , we present the field equations and effective one particle formalism , and in the section iii we consider solutions in the lorentzian and euclidean regions of spacetime .",
    "there are two kinds of lorentzian spacetime region : one before tunneling which is the one studied by roberts , brady , and frolov .",
    "the other is the region after tunneling . in the euclidean region",
    "an instanton type solution is obtained . in the section",
    "iv we join continuously the above three regions to treat black hole formation by quantum tunneling of the subcritical collapse of a scalar field . in the last section , we discuss similar problems in general dimensions .",
    "we study the minimally coupled scalar field in the four dimensional spacetime whose action is @xmath2 + { 1\\over 8\\pi } \\int_{\\partial m }   d^3x k \\sqrt{-h }   \\label{eq01}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the trace of second fundamental form of the boundary .",

    "we call this the lorentzian region i , where roberts , brady , and frolov@xcite provide explicit solutions in this region .",
    "there is another region , we call the lorentzian region ii , where classical motion is allowed , for @xmath41 . for quantum tunneling",
