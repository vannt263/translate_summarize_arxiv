    "neutron stars , which comprise hadrons and leptons as remnants of supernovae explosions , may be believed to be cosmological laboratories for dense nuclear matter .",
    "however , their detailed properties , for instance , the mass , radius and particle fractions in the core of a neutron star , are not fully understood yet , since the pioneering paper by baade and zwicky  @xcite and the first discovery of a neutron star by hewish and okoye  @xcite . because the observed mass and/or radius of a neutron star can provide strong constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) of dense nuclear matter , many theoretical discussions have been focused on the eos to understand the structure of dense matter .",
    "the typical mass of neutron stars is known to be around @xmath3 ( @xmath4 : the solar mass )  @xcite .",
    "the most famous , precisely observed pulsar is the binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 ( the hulse - taylor pulsar ) with the mass of @xmath5  @xcite . however , a few neutron stars whose masses are much heavier than @xmath3 have recently been observed .",
    "for example , shapiro delay measurements have indicated that the binary millisecond pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 has the mass of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "then , such heavy neutron stars have attracted a lot of interest not only in astrophysics but also in nuclear physics , because of the possibility of exotic degrees of freedom , such as quarks , gluons and/or some unusual condensations of boson - like matter , in the core .",
    "recently , many people have often used relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models ( or relativistic hartree models ) including hyperons ( @xmath7 ) to calculate the eos for a neutron star .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to explain the heavy neutron stars by such eoss with the meson - baryon coupling constants based on su(6 ) ( quark model ) symmetry , because the degrees of freedom of hyperons make the eos very soft , and thus the possible maximum mass of a neutron star is considerably reduced  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the properties of a neutron star have been studied in detail within relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) approximation . in those calculations ,",
    "we have considered not only the tensor couplings of vector mesons to the octet baryons and the form factors at interaction vertices but also the change of the internal ( quark ) structure of baryons in dense matter .",
    "the rhf calculations have performed in two ways : one with the coupling constants determined by su(6 ) symmetry , the other with the coupling constants based on su(3 ) ( flavor ) symmetry ( see also ref .",
    "then , we have found that the baryon composition of the core matter in su(3 ) symmetry is completely different from that in su(6 ) symmetry . in su(6 ) symmetry , all octet baryons appear in the density region below @xmath8 @xmath9 , while , in the su(3 ) calculation , only the @xmath10 hyperon is produced .",
    "furthermore , the medium modification of the internal baryon structure hardens the eos for the core .",
    "taking all those effects into account , we have obtained the maximum mass of a neutron star which is consistent with psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "therefore , it is very vital to consider the extension from su(6 ) symmetry to su(3 ) symmetry and the effect of the internal baryon - structure variation in nuclear matter .",
    "now it is interesting to construct the eos based on su(3 ) symmetry in rmf approximation , and to see how the symmetry extension affects the eos , because the rmf calculation is practically much simpler than the rhf one , and many people have thus proposed many useful rmf models , some of which are accurately calibrated by various experimental data not only on infinite nuclear matter but also on finite nuclei . in this paper , we extend several popular rmf models , such as the gm1 , gm3 , nl3 , tm1 , fsugold and iu - fsu models , and study the properties of nuclear matter and the mass - radius relations of neutron stars using the isoscalar , vector - meson couplings to the octet baryons in su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "we then compare the results in su(3 ) symmetry with those in the ( usual ) su(6 ) calculations .",
    "in addition , we propose rmf models including the variation of baryon structure in a dense medium . in such models",
    ", we also use the coupling constants determined in su(3 ) symmetry , and compare the results with those calculated in su(6 ) symmetry . to take the variation of the in - medium baryon structure into account , we use the quark - meson coupling ( qmc )  @xcite and the chiral quark - meson coupling ( cqmc )  @xcite models . it is well recognized that the constituent quark mass in a hadron is generally given by the quark condensate , @xmath11 . the quark mass ( or @xmath11 ) in nuclear matter may then be reduced from the value in vacuum , because of the condensed scalar ( @xmath12 ) field depending on the nuclear density , namely the lorentz - scalar , attractive interaction in nuclear matter .",
    "the decrease of the quark mass leads to the variation of baryon internal structure at the quark level .",
    "such an effect is considered self - consistently in the qmc model .",
    "the cqmc model is an extended version of the qmc model , in which the quark - quark hyperfine interaction caused by the one - gluon exchange is included . in addition , the pion - exchange interaction based on chiral symmetry is also considered .",
    "the hyperfine interaction plays an impotent role in the baryon spectra in matter  @xcite .",
    "the qmc and cqmc models have been successfully applied in studying the properties of hadrons in nuclear matter  @xcite , finite nuclei  @xcite , hypernuclei  @xcite and neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite . )    using those models , we calculate the particle fractions , the meson fields and the eos inside the core .",
    "furthermore , we estimate the maximum mass and radius of a neutron star by solving the the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation  @xcite . in the present calculations , we also study the role of the strange mesons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) in the eos . in su(3 ) symmetry",
    ", we then find that the models except for gm3 , fsugold and iu - fsu can explain the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 . in the gm3 , fsugold and iu - fsu models , although the maximum mass can not reach @xmath6 , the calculated mass is not far from that value .",
    "therefore , the extension from su(6 ) to su(3 ) symmetry is very vital for sustaining a heavy neutron star .",
    "in addition , the strange vector - meson ( @xmath1 ) and the medium variation of baryon structure also help prevent the collapse of a neutron star",
    ".    in rmf models , various types of nonlinear potentials with respect to the meson fields are usually involved , and they are very significant to reproduce the saturation condition for symmetric nuclear matter and the properties of finite nuclei . among them , especially the @xmath13 term hardens the eos at high density , and thus enhances a neutron - star mass .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear isoscalar - isovector coupling , @xmath14 , which is involved only in the fsugold and iu - fsu models , plays a unique role in the particle fractions in the core .",
    "if the @xmath12-@xmath15 and @xmath0-@xmath15 coupling constants are determined so as to fit the ( repulsive ) mean - field potential for the @xmath15 in nuclear matter , the @xmath15 hyperon usually tends to be excluded in the core of a neutron star .",
    "however , in the fsugold and iu - fsu models , the @xmath16 as well as the @xmath17 and @xmath10 can emerge with a considerable fraction even at rather low density , which may be caused by the @xmath14 interaction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : extended - rmf - model ] , a brief review for rmf models based on quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd )  @xcite is presented .",
    "the usual rmf models , the qmc and cqmc models are then unified through the scalar polarizability . in section",
    "[ sec : su3-symmetry ] , the su(3 ) extension in the coupling constants of the isoscalar , vector mesons is explained .",
    "the parameters in various models are determined in section  [ sec : models ] .",
    "numerical results and discussions are addressed in section  [ sec : results - and - discussions ] .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "for describing the properties of the core of a neutron star , we extend the usual lagrangian density in rmf approximation to include not only the @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 mesons but also the strange mesons , namely the isoscalar , lorentz scalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath1 ) mesons .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are predominantly comprised of @xmath20 quarks . because the charge neutrality and @xmath21 equilibrium conditions are imposed in the core , the leptons must be introduced as well . the lagrangian density is thus chosen to be @xmath22\\psi_{b }      \\nonumber \\\\      & + & \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma - m_{\\sigma}^{2}\\sigma^{2 } \\right )      + \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\partial_{\\mu}\\sigma^{\\ast}\\partial^{\\mu}\\sigma^{\\ast }      - m_{\\sigma^{\\ast}}^{2}\\sigma^{\\ast2 } \\right )      \\nonumber \\\\      & + & \\frac{1}{2}m_{\\omega}^{2}\\omega_{\\mu}\\omega^{\\mu } - \\frac{1}{4}w_{\\mu\\nu}w^{\\mu\\nu }      + \\frac{1}{2}m_{\\phi}^{2}\\phi_{\\mu}\\phi^{\\mu } - \\frac{1}{4}p_{\\mu\\nu}p^{\\mu\\nu }      + \\frac{1}{2}m_{\\rho}^{2}\\vec{\\rho}_{\\mu}\\cdot\\vec{\\rho}^{\\,\\mu }      - \\frac{1}{4}\\vec{r}_{\\mu\\nu}\\cdot\\vec{r}^{\\mu\\nu }      \\nonumber \\\\      & - & u_{nl}(\\sigma,\\omega^{\\mu},\\vec{\\rho}^{\\,\\mu } )      + \\sum_{\\ell}\\bar{\\psi}_{\\ell}\\left[i\\gamma_{\\mu}\\partial^{\\mu}-m_{\\ell}\\right]\\psi_{\\ell } \\ ,    \\label{eq : total - lagrangian - density}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 with @xmath24 the baryon ( lepton ) field , @xmath25 the isospin matrix for baryon @xmath26 and @xmath27 the lepton mass .",
    "the sum @xmath26 runs over the octet baryons , @xmath28 ( proton and neutron ) , @xmath17 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the sum @xmath31 is for the leptons , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath18- , @xmath1- and @xmath34-@xmath26 coupling constants are respectively denoted by @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : total - lagrangian - density ] ) , @xmath38 is a nonlinear potential , which is explained below .",
    "when the baryons are treated as point - like objects ( as in qhd ) , the effective baryon mass , @xmath39 , in matter is simply expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass in vacuum , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the @xmath12- and @xmath0-@xmath26 coupling constants , respectively .",
    "we hereafter call the model in which the baryons are structureless the qhd - type model .",
    "in contrast , in the qmc and cqmc models , the coupling constants , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , depend on the @xmath12 and @xmath0 fields , which reflects the variation of internal baryon structure in matter  @xcite .",
    "such dependences are caused by the attractive interactions due to the @xmath12 and @xmath0 exchanges .",

    ", we introduce four parameters , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , for describing the mass , and their values are tabulated in table  [ tab : qmc - parameter ] .",
    ".[tab : qmc - parameter ] values of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the octet baryons in the qmc or cqmc model .",
    "we assume that the scalar , strange ( @xmath0 ) meson does not couple to the nucleon . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the core of a neutron star , the charge neutrality and @xmath21 equilibrium under weak processes are imposed in solving the tov equation  @xcite . to obtain the realistic relation between the mass and radius of a neutron star , for the eos at very low nuclear densities ( @xmath52 @xmath9 )",
    ", we use the models given by baym , bethe , pethick and sutherland  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the radius is relatively sensitive to the eos at low density .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : composition - qmc ] - [ fig : composition - fsu ] , we show the particle fractions in the core of a neutron star . in each model , we calculate three cases : ( 1 ) only the non - strange mesons ( @xmath12 , @xmath18 and @xmath34 ) are included in su(6 ) symmetry ; ( 2 ) all the mesons including the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are considered in su(6 ) symmetry ; ( 3 ) all the mesons are included in su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "we note that , in some panels in the figures , the calculation stops at a certain density because the effective nucleon mass becomes zero beyond that density .    as seen in the figures , from case ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) in order , the hyperons are created at higher densities .",
    "for example , the threshold densities of the @xmath17 and @xmath10 productions in su(3 ) symmetry are higher than those in su(6 ) symmetry , which makes the fractions of hyperons small at high densities and thus increases the neutron fraction .    in the models except for fsugold and iu - fsu , the @xmath17 and @xmath30 hyperons are created , but the @xmath15 does not appear , because the @xmath15-hyperon potential in nuclear matter , @xmath53 , is chosen to be repulsive ( see section  [ subsec : su(6 ) ] ) disappear . ] . however , in the fsugold and iu - fsu models , because the rather strong , @xmath18-@xmath34 ( nonlinear ) repulsive interaction , @xmath54 , is included ( see eq.([eq : lagrangian - nl ] ) ) , the @xmath30 fields are very suppressed at high densities ( especially , in the su(3 ) case ) , and the @xmath16 alternatively appears beyond @xmath55 @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , the order of the threshold densities for the @xmath10 and @xmath16 is reversed in the su(6 ) and su(3 ) cases .",
    "this is a very remarkable phenomenon , and the isoscalar - isovector nonlinear interaction , @xmath54 , plays a unique role in the particle fractions .",
    "the meson fields are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : field - qmc ] - [ fig : field - fsu ] . as it should be , in su(6 )",
    "symmetry , the strange - meson fields appear in the density region where the hyperons are generated .",
    "on the other hand , in su(3 ) symmetry , the @xmath1 meson contributes to the baryon interactions even at low densities because of the mixing effect .",
    "however , the @xmath0 meson emerges above the density at which the first hyperon ( usually the @xmath17 ) is created .",
    "this is because we assume that @xmath56 .",
    "in the fsugold and iu - fsu models , the fields of @xmath18 and @xmath34 mesons ( especially the @xmath34 ) are very suppressed because of the isoscalar - isovector , nonlinear interaction .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : eos - qmc - cqmc ] - [ fig : eos - fsu - iu - fsu ] , we show the eos in each model .",
    "furthermore , in figs .",
    "[ fig : tov - qmc - cqmc ] - [ fig : tov - fsu - iu - fsu ] , we present the mass - radius relation of a neutron star calculated by the tov equation . the detail of the neutron - star properties is also shown in table  [ tab : ns - properties ] .",
    "as expected , because the isoscalar , vector - meson couplings to the octet baryons are enhanced in su(3 ) symmetry , the extension from su(6 ) to su(3 ) symmetry hardens the eos very much . in each model ,",
    "the hardest eos is given by the case ( 3 ) , while the softest one is obtained in the case ( 1 ) .",
    "this tendency can be related to the fact that , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : composition - qmc ] - [ fig : composition - fsu ] , the densities at which the hyperons appear in the case ( 3 ) are rather higher than those in the case ( 1 ) . in general",
    ", the strange mesons , especially the @xmath1 meson , also play an important role in supporting a heavy neutron star . in the mass - radius relations presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : tov - qmc - cqmc ] - [ fig : tov - fsu - iu - fsu ] , we can again see that , in each model , the maximum neutron - star mass in the case ( 3 ) is heaviest , while the lightest one is given in the case ( 1 ) .",
    "we note that , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tov - gm1-gm3 ] , the curve ( red solid ) for the nl3 model in su(3 ) symmetry can not reach the maximum point because the nucleon mass becomes negative at the density before the maximum point .",
    "we summarize the following , several comments on the mass - radius relations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : tov - qmc - cqmc ] - [ fig : tov - fsu - iu - fsu ] . in the qmc and cqmc models",
    ", the maximum neutron - star masses calculated in su(3 ) symmetry are consistent with the pulsar psr j1614 - 2230 . in particular",
    ", the mass in the cqmc model clearly exceeds the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "because the difference between the qmc and cqmc models is originated by the hyperfine interaction between two quarks inside a baryon , the large difference between the two maximum masses is mainly generated by this microscopic interaction .",
    "it is noticeable that the quark - quark hyperfine interaction is very vital to obtain the correct mass spectra of octet baryons in a nuclear medium  @xcite .    in the gm1 model ,",
    "the maximum neutron - star mass in su(3 ) symmetry is much larger than the observed mass of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "in contrast , the maximum mass in the gm3 model is clearly under the observed value ( see the left panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : tov - gm1-gm3 ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two models is just in the values of the nuclear incompressibility and the slope parameter , namely @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 mev for the gm1(3 ) model ( see table  [ tab : cc - non - linear - sigma ] ) .",
    "the nl3 model is a unique model , in which the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 can be explained even in su(6 ) symmetry ( see the right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : tov - gm1-gm3 ] ) .",
    "this model may be characterized by the large values of symmetry energy ( @xmath59 mev ) and slope parameter ( @xmath60 mev ) ( see table  [ tab : cc - non - linear - sigma ] ) .",
    "the rather large values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 are also used in the tm1 model , where only the su(3 ) result can , however , reach the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 .",
    "furthermore , the difference between the maximum masses in su(6 ) and su(3 ) symmetries is very large in the tm1 model ( see also table  [ tab : ns - properties ] ) .",
    "this fact may be caused by the repulsive force due to the nonlinear @xmath63 term in eq.([eq : lagrangian - nl ] ) .",
    "note that , to reproduce the same saturation condition as in su(6 ) symmetry , the strength of @xmath64 in su(3 ) symmetry is larger than that in su(6 ) symmetry ( see table  [ tab : cc - non - linear - sigma - omega - rho ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 can not be explained by the fsugold and iu - fsu models .",
    "however , in both models the maximum mass in su(3 ) symmetry becomes @xmath65 , which is not far from the observed mass . in these models ,",
    "the maximum mass in su(6 ) symmetry is again very different from the value in su(3 ) symmetry ( see table  [ tab : ns - properties ] ) .",
    "furthermore , although the curves for @xmath66 in the su(6 ) and su(3 ) cases normally coincide with each other in the low mass region ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : tov - qmc - cqmc ] - [ fig : tov - gm1-gm3 ] ) , the two curves clearly stay away from each other even at @xmath67 in the fsugold and iu - fsu models ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tov - fsu - iu - fsu ] ) . these facts",
    "may again be caused by the very large difference between the values of @xmath64 in su(6 ) and su(3 ) symmetries ( see table  [ tab : cc - non - linear - sigma - omega - rho ] ) .",
    "we have calculated the particle fractions , the meson fields and the eos in the core of a neutron star , using the popular rmf models ( such as gm1 , gm3 , nl3 , tm1 , fsugold and iu - fsu ) as well as the qmc and cqmc models .",
    "it is noticeable that some of the rmf models are accurately parameterized to compute the properties of infinite nuclear matter and finite nuclei . on the other hand , because , in the qmc and cqmc models , the quark degrees of freedom in a baryon are taken into account , they allow us to consider the variation of the quark structure of baryon in dense mater . in particular , the cqmc model involves the quark - quark hyperfine interaction , and thus it can correctly describe the octet baryon spectra in matter as well as in vacuum .    in the present calculations ,",
    "we have examined the extension from su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry based on the quark model to su(3 ) flavor symmetry in determining the isoscalar , vector - meson couplings to the octet baryons .",
    "we have also studied how the strange mesons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) contribute to the internal structure of a neutron star .    in su(3 ) symmetry , we have found that the models except gm3 , fsugold and iu - fsu can explain the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 . in the gm3 , fsugold and iu - fsu models , although the maximum mass can not reach @xmath6 , the calculated mass is not far from that value .",
    "therefore , the extension from su(6 ) to su(3 ) symmetry and the strange vector meson , @xmath1 , are very significant in sustaining a heavy neutron star . in addition",
    ", the variation of baryon structure in matter also helps prevent the collapse of a neutron star .    in rmf models ,",
    "the nl potential , @xmath38 , is indispensable for reproducing the saturation condition for symmetric nuclear matter and the properties of finite nuclei . in the present calculations , it involves not only the usual , nonlinear @xmath12 terms but also the @xmath63 term and the isoscalar - isovector @xmath54 term . among them",
    ", in particular , the nonlinear @xmath63 term hardens the eos , and thus enhances a neutron - star mass .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear isoscalar - isovector coupling plays a unique role in the particle fractions inside a neutron star .",
    "because the @xmath12-@xmath15 and @xmath0-@xmath15 coupling constants are usually determined so as to fit the ( repulsive ) mean - field potential for the @xmath15 in nuclear matter , it becomes difficult to create the @xmath15 hyperon in the core of a neutron star .",
    "however , in the fsugold and iu - fsu models , instead of the @xmath30 , the @xmath16 can emerge with a considerable fraction even at rather low density .",
    "as the power counting  @xcite suggests , there may be many possible , nl couplings and many - body forces containing various meson fields , which may contribute to the eos .",
    "it is thus interesting to study how such interactions contribute to the properties of a neutron star .",
    "we note that , at the mf level , the nl potential may be regarded as many - body interactions among baryons because the meson fields are just auxiliary fields and thus they can be replaced with bilinear forms of baryon fields .    in rmf models ,",
    "the parameterization is usually performed using experimental data measured around @xmath68 . however , because the region of density which is important in the eos for a neutron star may be the region of @xmath69 @xmath9 ( @xmath70 ) , no one knows if such parameterizations work correctly at such high densities .",
    "therefore , although in this paper we have studied rmf models from various standpoints , it may be difficult to winnow the good models out at the rmf level . as suggested in dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock calculations  @xcite , it may , at least , be imperative to include the density dependence of the parameters to obtain conclusive results on the eos .    in the present calculations , we have not considered the fock ( exchange ) term .",
    "although , in _ naive _ qhd - i  @xcite , the fock contribution seems very small in symmetric nuclear matter , it plays a very important role even around the normal nuclear matter density as well as at high densities , if the @xmath34 meson is included and the tensor interaction thus arises  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that , when the tensor interaction is taken into account , the @xmath17 hyperon does not appear in the core even at high density  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the tensor contribution is very important in reproducing the density dependence of symmetry energy , @xmath61 .    at very high density",
    ", the quark and gluon degrees of freedom , rather than the hadron degrees of freedom , may take place in the core matter  @xcite . because the degrees of freedom in quark - gluon matter are generally large , it is necessary to assume a rather strong correlation between quarks and gluons to support a massive neutron - star mass .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate how the quark - gluon phase connects with the hadron one and how such degrees of freedom contribute to the eos for a neutron star .",

    "<S> using several relativistic mean field models ( such as gm1 , gm3 , nl3 , tm1 , fsugold and iu - fsu ) as well as the quark - meson coupling model , we calculate the particle fractions , the equation of state , the maximum mass and radius of a neutron star within relativistic hartree approximation . in determining the couplings of the isoscalar , vector mesons to the octet baryons </S>",
    "<S> , we examine the extension of su(6 ) spin - flavor symmetry to su(3 ) flavor symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we consider the strange ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) mesons , and study how they affect the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the equation of state in su(3 ) symmetry can sustain a neutron star with mass of @xmath2 even if hyperons exist inside the core . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the strange vector ( @xmath1 ) meson and the variation of baryon structure in matter also play important roles in supporting a massive neutron star . </S>"
