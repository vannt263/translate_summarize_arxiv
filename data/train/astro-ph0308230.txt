    "algol , whose name derives from arabic for `` the ghoul '' , is the brightest eclipsing binary system in the sky and the prototype of its class .",
    "algol - type binaries provide laboratories for studying close - binary evolution , roche lobe overflow and mass transfer , and the extremes of stellar magnetic activity .",
    "they are comprised of an early - type main - sequence primary and a less massive late - type subgiant secondary that fills its roche lobe and loses mass to the primary .",
    "the secondary is the initially more massive star of the system that has evolved first , but has then been demoted by transfer of its mass onto the initially less massive primary .",
    "the comparatively faint mass - losing secondary can be stripped down to layers whose composition has been radically altered by core hydrogen burning ( e.g.  sarna & de  greve  1996 ) .",
    "the late - type secondaries of algol systems are strongly magnetically active .",
    "tidal forces synchronise rotational and orbital periods of these close binaries , and consequent rapid rotation excites dynamo action in the convection zone of the evolved star that is manifest at the surface in the form of chromospheric and coronal emission ( eg s.a .",
    "drake , simon & linsky 1989 ; singh , s.a .",
    "drake & white 1995 ) .",
    "radio and x - ray activity levels of algol systems are similar to , but slightly lower than , those of their close relatives the short - period rs  cvn - type binaries , in which both members are late - type stars ( singh et al .",
    "1996 ; sarna , yerli & muslimov 1998 ) .",
    "eclipsing algol - type binaries provide very accurate stellar masses and radii with which to confront sophisticated models that follow the evolution of the component stars , including roche lobe overflow and mass transfer ( e.g.  sarna 1992,1993 ; nelson & eggleton 2001 ) . quantitative determination of element abundances modified by nuclear processing in stellar interiors can provide critical tests of these evolutionary models . in particular , the degree of c depletion and n enhancement through cn - cycle processing in the secondary can provide a measure of the depth to which its outer layers have been stripped . in turn , the primary receives mass that might have been partially processed by nuclear burning but that is then diluted by rotationally - induced and thermohaline mixing with its pristine envelope .",
    "measurements of c and n in the primary can then help constrain these mixing processes and the initial stellar mass of unprocessed material .",
    "based on high - resolution optical spectra , parthasarathy , lambert & tomkin ( 1983 ) showed that the secondaries of the algol binaries u  cep and u  sge were depleted in c and enhanced in n by significantly greater amounts than field giants of similar spectral type .",
    "the more pronounced abundance changes are the result of the cn - processed material being mixed with a less massive outer envelope , confirming that these stars lost a significant amount of mass prior to the onset of deep convection .",
    "cugier & hardorp ( 1988 ) , cugier ( 1989 ) , dobias & plavek ( 1985 ) and polidan & wade ( 1992 ) also found c depletions in the primaries and secondaries of several systems based on international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) observations of c  ii and c  iv absorption and emission lines .",
    "peters & polidan ( 1984 ) found evidence for c depletion in circumstellar matter in several systems , and an extreme c depletion was found in au  mon .",
    "further studies of c and n abundances based on optical spectra of several algol systems undertaken by tomkin & lambert ( 1989 ) , yoon & honeycutt ( 1992 ) , tomkin , lambert & lemke ( 1993 ) and tomkin & lambert ( 1994 ) confirmed the general pattern of moderate to strong c and n abundance changes in secondary stars and less extreme changes in the primaries .",
    "the general picture of the chemical evolution of algols and observational results supporting it has been summarised and explained in the review of sarna & degreve ( 1996 ) .",
    "algol primaries dominate the uv and optical spectra of these systems and are generally accessible for abundance studies .",
    "however , the comparatively faint secondaries can only be studied reliably during total eclipse .",
    "moreover , the rapid rotation of these stars smears out spectral lines rendering high resolution spectroscopic studies more uncertain . in the case of algol itself , no c and n abundances results exist for the secondary star .",
    "in contrast to uv - optical wavelengths , at x - ray wavelengths algol systems with primaries of spectral type mid - b to late - a are entirely dominated by the magnetically active secondary .",
    "primaries in this spectral type range do not have either an outer convective envelope thought to be required to sustain strong coronal activity , or a strong , shocked stellar wind thought to be responsible for x - ray emission from o and early b stars .    in this paper , using _",
    "chandra _ low energy transmission grating spectrograph ( letgs ) x - ray spectra of ly@xmath9 resonance transitions in c and n h - like ions (  [ s : obs ] ) , i determine for the first time c and n abundances in the secondary of algol (  [ s : abun_rats ] ) .",
    "this study is performed relative to a `` standard '' star , the rs  cvn system hr  1099 .",
    "as this work was nearing completion , schmitt & ness ( 2002 ) presented an analysis of c and n lines in several different stars , including algol .",
    "though they did not derive formal values for c and n abundances , their work demonstrated that the surface abundances of the secondary of algol have indeed been strongly modified through cn - processing .",
    "ness et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have also recently presented an analysis of other aspects of the _ chandra _ letg spectrum , including electron densities and temperature diagnostics . in ",
    "[ s : theo_comp ] , i compare the abundances derived here with theoretical predictions and show that these are consistent with current evolutionary models for algol .",
    "uncertainties and possible complications for this analysis are discussed in  [ s : uncert ] .",
    "the x - ray deficiencies of algol systems compared to rs  cvn - type binaries are discussed briefly in  [ s : comment ] , and a summary of this paper is presented in  [ s : summary ] .",
    "chandra letgs spectra of algol and hr  1099 where obtained in 2000 march and 2001 january , respectively , using the letg and high resolution camera spectroscopic ( hrc - s ) detector in its standard instrument configuration .",
    "the observations are summarised in table  [ t : obs ] .",
    "observational data were obtained from the public chandra data archive .",
    "pipeline - processed ( cxc software version 6.3.1 ) photon event lists were reduced using the ciao software package version 2.2 , and were analysed using the pintofale idl software suite ( kashyap & drake 2000 ) .",
    "processing included filtering of events based on observed signal pulse - heights to reduce background ( wargelin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the spectra of the two stars are compared throughout the wavelength range of the letg+hrc - s in figure  [ f : spectra ] , and in the limited wavelength range 20 - 38    in figure  [ f : cno ] ; identifications for prominent spectral lines are also indicated .",
    "i first examined each data set in order to determine the extent to which hr  1099 and algol might have varied during the observations .",
    "this is important because it is suspected that large flares are accompanied in some cases by detectable changes in the coronal abundances of the plasma that dominates disk - averaged spectra ( see , eg , drake 2002 for a recent review ) .",
    "light curves for both observations were derived using the 0th order events extracted in a circular aperture that were then binned at 100s intervals .",
    "these light curves are illustrated in figure  [ f : lc ] .",
    "both are smooth and devoid of obvious flare activity .",
    "i therefore conclude that these observations are representative of hr  1099 and algol during times of quiescence , and are thus well - suited to comparing the coronal abundances of these stars .",
    "it is also worth noting the orbital phase during the observations : according to the ephemeris of kim ( 1989 ) , the observation started at phase @xmath10 and ended at @xmath11 , where @xmath12 when algol  b star is nearest the observer .",
    "no significant spectral evolution was seen during this period , consistent with an earlier hetg observation analysed by chung et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "irradiation by the strong uv flux of the primary does not then have a significant influence on the gross features of the spectrum , though radiative excitation of transitions from the metastable levels in he - like ions has been observed ( e.g.ness et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "i restrict the following spectral analysis to the wavelength range 15 - 35   , which contains the prominent lines of c , n and o , and also includes the prominent 2p@xmath43d  @xmath5p@xmath6 @xmath2 2p@xmath7  @xmath5s@xmath8 resonance transition of fe  xvii at 15.01    and h - like ne ly@xmath9 seen in second and third orders .",
    "spectral line fluxes were measured by fitting `` modified lorentzian '' functions of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the amplitude and @xmath15 a characteristic line width . for a value of @xmath16 , it has been found that this function represents the line response function of the letg+hrc - s instrument to the photometric accuracy of lines with of order a few 1000 counts or less ( drake et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the apparent continuum level in the spectral region 25.5 - 28.0   , judged by both visual inspection and examination of radiative loss model spectral line lists to be `` line - free '' , was also determined in order to obtain a relative measure of continuum flux intensity .",
    "the flux , @xmath17 , from a collisionally - excited transition @xmath18 in an ion of an element with abundance @xmath19 in an optically - thin collision - dominated plasma can be written as @xmath20 \\;dt % \\overline{n_e^2}(t)\\ , \\frac{dv(t)}{dt } \\;dt \\,\\,\\ , \\mbox{erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ } \\label{e : flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a known constant which includes the frequency of the transition and the stellar distance , and @xmath22 is the `` contribution '' function of the line that describes the temperature dependence of the line emissivity .",
    "this quantity defines the temperature interval , @xmath23 , over which the line is formed , and is dependent on the atomic physics of the particular transition .",
    "the kernel @xmath24 $ ] is commonly known as the _ differential emission measure _ ( dem ) @xmath25=\\overline{n_e^2}(t)\\frac{dv(t)}{dt } \\label{e : dem}\\ ] ] and describes the temperature structure of the excitation power of the plasma , which is proportional to the mean of the square of the electron density , @xmath26 , and the emitting volume @xmath27 .",
    "if one makes the assumption that the dems of the coronae of algol and hr  1099 are very similar in terms of temperature dependence , then the expression for the ratio of fluxes in a given transition observed from the two stars reduces to the product of the ratio of abundances , @xmath19 , and the ratio of the emission measures of the two stars , @xmath28_a}{\\phi[n_e(t),v(t)]_h }   \\frac{a_a}{a_h}=q\\frac{a_a}{a_h } \\label{e : flux_rat}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath19 and @xmath29 denote algol and hr  1099 , respectively , and @xmath30 represents the ratio of source dems .",
    "i adopt that assumption for the analysis here ; i will further attempt to justify this in  [",
    "s : abun_rats ] and comment on its propriety in  [ s : uncert ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath30 can be determined from the source continua . the continuum flux",
    "_ density _",
    "@xmath31 per unit wavelength interval can be approximated by the integral over temperature of the product of the dem kernel and the expression for the emissivity of continuum processes ( e.g.  mewe , lemen & van den oord 1986 ) @xmath32 \\;dt   \\;\\ ; { \\rm erg\\ ; cm^{-2}\\ ; s^{-1}\\ ; \\aa^{-1 } } \\label{e : cont}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is again a constant involving the stellar distance , and @xmath34 is the total gaunt factor representing the sum of the gaunt factors for the free - free , free - bound and two - photon processes for all elements in the source plasma . in practice , the total gaunt factor is dominated by that of h , and to a lesser extent , he .",
    "provided the temperature dependence of the dem is approximately the same in both stars , the ratio of dems , @xmath30 , reduces simply to the integrated continuum flux ratios within an arbitrary wavelength interval : @xmath35    observed intensities ( total counts ) and their ratios , @xmath36 , for the features of interest here are listed in table  [ t : fluxes ] .",
    "note that no lines of c were detected in the algol spectrum , and only an upper limit could be obtained for h - like ly@xmath9  33.74   .",
    "this is dramatically illustrated in figure  [ f : cno ] in which c  vi is clearly detected in hr  1099 in @xmath37 and @xmath38 transitions .",
    "i first draw particular attention to the remarkable similarity of the spectra of algol and hr1099 illustrated in figure  [ f : spectra ] .",
    "the spectra show strong resemblence to one another in both the distribution of lines due to ions of different elements and formed at different coronal temperatures , and in the relative strengths of these lines , throughout the letg range .",
    "it is clear from this comparison that the x - ray emitting coronae of algol and hr1099 essentially share the same gross characteristics of temperature structure and relative element abundances .",
    "as i show below , carbon and nitrogren abundances are conspicuous exceptions .    a further test that the temperature structures of the dems of algol and hr  1099 are very similar , at least in the temperature range that concerns us for the elements c and n , can be found in the temperature - sensitive ratios of h - like to he - like transitions among the cno trio .",
    "while the he - like complexes of both n and c are both very weak and blended in algol and hr  1099 spectra , the he - like o  vii resonance line @xmath39 is well - observed and can be compared with the h - like @xmath40 .",
    "the observed photon counts in each line are listed for the two stars in table  [ t : fluxes ] and their ratios @xmath41 are @xmath42 and @xmath43 for algol and hr  1099 , respectively  identical to within experimental uncertainties .",
    "turning now to c and n , a qualitative sense of the abundances of these elements in algol relative to hr  1099 is immediately apparent on inspection of figure  [ f : cno ] .",
    "lines of h - like n are stronger by more than a factor of two in algol , whereas c is strong in hr  1099 yet undetected in algol .",
    "similar results were presented by schmitt & ness ( 2002 ) .",
    "relative element abundances were derived from the observed line and continuum fluxes using equations  [ e : flux]-[e : cont ] in  [ s : obs ] .",
    "i express abundances in algol relative to those in hr  1099 , thereby using the latter as the `` standard '' star . in the conventional spectroscopic bracket notation , the logarithmic relative abundance of element x , [ x / h]@xmath44 , is given by the logarithmic difference between line and continuum flux ratios : @xmath45}_{1099}=\\log_{10}\\frac{f_{xa}}{f_{xh } } -   \\log_{10}\\frac{f_{ca}}{f_{ch } } \\label{e : rel_abun}\\ ] ]",
    "the resulting abundances for fe , o and ne are listed in table  [ t : abuns ] .",
    "the corresponding numbers for c and n are [ c / h]@xmath46 and [ n / h]@xmath47 .",
    "the formal uncertainty on the n abundance based on the line intensity measurements is only 0.02  dex , though a more realistic uncertainty is of order 0.1  dex (  [ s : uncert ] ) .",
    "these c and n abundances demonstrate formally the severe depletion of c and enhancement of n in the corona of algol b. expressed as an abundance ratio , i obtain [ c / n]@xmath48 , which is a factor of 100 lower than the solar photospheric value of c / n@xmath49 ( allende prieto et al .  2002 ; grevesse & sauval 1998 ) .",
    "i do not quote the values [ c / h]@xmath44 and [ n / h]@xmath44 in table  [ t : abuns ] because these quantities do not tell us directly what the changes in c and n abundances resulting from nuclear processing are . to determine these changes , we need to ascertain the values of the original c and n abundances in the unprocessed envelope of algol b. there are two complications to this .",
    "firstly , as noted in ",
    "[ s : intro ] , coronal abundances in at least some stars appear not to reflect the values in the underlying stellar photosphere . secondly , and again as noted in ",
    "[ s : intro ] , both algol and hr  1099 are `` metal - deficient '' in their coronae with respect to the _",
    "solar photosphere_. i address this latter point first .",
    "transitions involving electrons with ground states in the fe @xmath50 shell tend to dominate soft x - ray spectra of hot coronal plasmas , and for this reason fe is often used as a proxy for the global plasma metallicity .",
    "the coronal fe abundances for algol and hr  1099 are identical to within observational uncertainty . a recent measurement of the absolute fe abundance in the corona of hr  1099 , fe / h@xmath51 ( corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath52 relative to the solar photospheric abundance ; e.g.  grevesse & sauval 1998 ) was recently presented by drake et al .",
    "earlier estimates of the coronal fe abundance of algol have been made based on asca ( [ fe / h]@xmath53 , with the error based on statistical uncertainty only ; antunes , nagase & white 1994 ; see also singh , drake & white 1996 ) euve ( [ fe / h]@xmath54 to @xmath55 ; stern et al .",
    "1995 ) , while favata & schmitt ( 1999 ) obtained a global metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath56 during quiescence in an observation by bepposax that captured a very large flare ( the metallicity was interpreted as undergoing strong variations correlated with the flare rise and decay ) .",
    "the determination of the coronal fe abundance of algol , `` bootstrapped '' from the earlier drake et al .",
    "( 2001 ) absolute fe abundance of hr  1099 , is in fairly good agreement with these values , and i consider this result quite robust . in quoting these other abundance results ,",
    "i note that the works cited all adopted the solar abundance compilation of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , which employed an iron abundance fe / h@xmath57 .",
    "i have accordingly adjusted the relative abundances to a solar iron abundance of fe / h@xmath58 ( see drake , laming & widing 1995 for further details ) used by drake et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "having established the fe abundance in both algol and hr  1099 , the next question is whether or not the value obtained is representative of their photospheric fe abundances , or whether the coronal abundances have been altered by fractionation processes . to my knowledge ,",
    "no detailed photospheric abundance analyses of either algol a or b have been published and so a definitive answer to this question will have to wait . in either case , we have to consider what the initial c and n abundances , prior to mixing of the envelope and nuclear - processed core , would have been .",
    "the elements c and n do not share the same nucleosynthetic origins : the dominant isotope c@xmath59 is produced mostly by he - burning , while the dominant n isotope n@xmath60 is produced mainly by h - burning .",
    "studies of c and n photospheric abundances in stars of different metallicity ( as represented by fe ) show different trends .",
    "the abundance of c exhibits moderate enrichment relative to fe with decreasing [ fe / h ] , amounting to [ c / fe]@xmath61 at [ fe / h]@xmath62 ( e.g. tomkin , woolf & lambert 1995 , gustafsson et al .",
    "1999 ; shi , zhao & chen 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , the abundance of n appears to follow that of fe over a range of [ fe / h ] from @xmath63 to + 0.1 ( e.g.  shi et al .",
    "if algol and hr  1099 were mildly metal - deficient , and this reflected the actual stellar compositions and was not the result of coronal compositional fractionation , then we might therefore expect original c and n abundances of [ c / h]@xmath64 and [ n / h]@xmath65 . we can use these values , together with the c , and n solar photospheric abundances c / h=8.39 ( allended prieto et al .  2002 ) ,",
    "n / h=7.92 ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) to estimate projected changes in the number of c and n atoms in the envelope of algol  b. in the usual logarithmic notation for the number density relative to hydrogen , these are @xmath66c / h@xmath67 and @xmath66n / h@xmath68 . these values pose an immediate problem : in the cn - cycle , n is produced at the expense of a commensurate depletion in c , and the total number of c and n nuclei is expected to be conserved .",
    "that we do not arrive at equal changes in c and n implies that the initial unprocessed abundances assumed here are incorrect .",
    "this conclusion is not changed significantly because of the adoption of a slightly non - solar initial c / n abundance ratio expected in a disk star with [ fe / h]@xmath52 ; the difference only amounts",
    "to c / n being larger by 0.15  dex .",
    "an alternative approach is to determine what initial absolute abundances of c and n would match the observed c depletion and n enhancement in algol relative to hr  1099 . or , put another way , what value of metallicity , [ m / h ] , would be required for the total number of c and n nuclei to be conserved .",
    "the number density of an element @xmath69 is given by our observed fluxes and by equations  [ e : flux_rat ] and [ e : cont_rat ] .",
    "we write the observed ratios of c and n in algol and hr  1099 as @xmath70 we now assume , firstly , that the total number density of c and n nuclei in the processed envelope of algol remains unchanged compared to the initial pristine value , and , secondly , that this total number density is the same in hr  1099 , except for a scaling factor allowing for different global metallicities between the two stars , @xmath71 , \\label{e : totcn}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is ratio of metallicities by number .",
    "the c / n abundance ratios by number for algol and hr  1099 can then be written @xmath73 i illustrate these c / n abundance ratios as a function of the logarithm of the metallicity parameter @xmath74 in figure  [ f : cn ] , adopting the derived c abundance upper limit for algol as a proxy for use in the value @xmath75 . also indicated on this figure are the c / n abundance ratios from three sources : the solar ratio derived from the c abundance of allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the n abundance of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) that i adopt as `` reference '' solar values ; the ratio from the still commonly used solar abundance compilation of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) ; and the ratio from the abundance values derived relative to that of o for the coronae of hr  1099 itself based on xmm - newton observations by brinkman et al .",
    "the intersection of these c / n ratios with the hr  1099 c / n locus indicates the metallicity of algol relative to hr  1099 needed in order that the number density of c and n abundances be conserved .",
    "for the solar c / n ratios , we need a metallicity [ m / h]@xmath76 , whereas for the brinkman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) c / n ratio , the metallicity is @xmath77  dex .",
    "the uncertainties of the values are of order 0.1  dex or so .",
    "note that the metallicity derived in this way is not sensitive to the fact that i have used the _ upper limit _ to the c ratio , @xmath75 : nearly all ( over 90% ) of the c in algol has already been converted into n , and so the n abundance remains essentially the same regardless of the exact c abundance adopted .",
    "i have already established above that the fe abundances in the coronae of algol and hr  1099 are essentially the same .",
    "the `` metallicity '' values indicated by the c / n ratios suggest slightly lower abundances in algol than hr  1099 , and possibly significantly so .",
    "this `` metallicity '' is of course just a number representing c and n. however , i note that the abundances for o and ne are similar to this in being slightly lower in algol than in hr  1099 ; the error - weighted mean of the ne and o abundances ( table  [ t : abuns ] ) yields a `` metallicity '' [ m / h]@xmath78 , a value consistent , within errors of 0.1  dex or so , with the c / n result .",
    "i take this agreement as indicating that indeed the light element abundances in algol are lower by of order 0.2  dex than those in hr  1099 .    by assuming an initial c / n ratio and that this ratio is represented by the current c / n ratio in hr  1099",
    ", we arrive at a c / n ratio for algol ; these ratios are indicated in figure  [ f : cn ] and are c / n=@xmath79 for initial solar c / n ratios , and c / n=@xmath80 for an initial ratio equal to that of brinkman et al .",
    "as discussed above in  [ s : abun_rats ] , the assumption that the present - day c / n coronal abundance ratio in hr  1099 is representative of the ratio in the original unprocessed envelope of algol  b , and that this ratio in hr  1099 is similar to the solar ratio , implies the change in the c / n abundance ratio in algol  b as a result of nuclear processing and dredge - up is @xmath81  dex . in comparison",
    ", the changes expected at the surface of normal g and k giants in the post - dredge - up phase is @xmath82 to @xmath83 ( eg lambert & ries 1977 , 1981 ; see also  [ s : two - zone ] below ) .",
    "main - sequence cn - processing in the core of algol  b is expected to have been essentially the same as that in a single star of the same mass ; the extreme decrease in the post - dredge - up phase in algol  b is simply a result of a lower dilution factor of this cn - processed material because of the loss of material from its outer envelope to algol  a.      stellar evolution calculations for algol - type binaries that follow the surface abundances of c and n have been undertaken for intermediate mass systems by de  greve ( 1989,1993 ; see also de  greve 1986 ) , and sarna ( 1992,1993 ) .",
    "these authors conclude that the mass transfer in algol corresponds to early case  b , in which transfer is initiated by the expanding stellar envelope filling its roche lobe after turn - off from the main - sequence and the establishment of hydrogen shell burning . in the early stages of mass transfer ,",
    "the convection zone of the initially more massive algol  b would not have been fully - developed and so the envelope from which material was lost would only be partially mixed with deeper layers that had been subjected to cn - processing . during later stages , after most of the pristine outer envelope had been lost to algol  a , material from layers in which cn - processing had reached equilibrium , and that would also have been he - rich from h - burning , was transferred .",
    "being he - rich , this material would have induced thermohaline mixing on algol  a ( mixing resulting from the larger molecular weight of the overlying material ) , diluting the cn - processed material with the rest of the envelope of algol  a.    i compare the abundance results derived here with the detailed binary model evolutionary calculations specifically for algol performed by sarna ( 1993 ) .",
    "these models include the effects of non - conservative mass transfer , and mass and angular momentum loss through magnetic activity and stellar winds  effects that have been shown to be important for intermediate and lower mass algols that include a magnetically - active late - type component by , e.g. , sarna et al.(1997 ) , eggleton ( 2000 ) and nelson & eggleton ( 2001 ) .",
    "sarna ( 1993 ) was able to derive a model that successfully matched the present day observed parameters of the system , including the c abundance in algol a obtained by cugier & hardorp ( 1988 ) based on c  ii lines observed by the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) .",
    "the c abundance appears depleted in algol a by about a factor of 2 because of the dilution of its original envelope by material strongly depleted in c from algol b. changes in c and n abundances in algol b are predicted as part of these calculations and amount to @xmath84 ( sarna 1993 ) and @xmath85 ( m.  sarna , private communication ) , yielding a change in the c / n abundance ratio of @xmath86 .    within reasonable uncertainties , the sarna ( 1993 ) abundances are quite consistent with the values derived in this study .",
    "as discussed at length above , the individual c and n abundances depend on the adoption of the metallicity for these elements .",
    "formally , then , our adopted n abundance is 0.1  dex higher than the model prediction and to lower it by this amount requires a lower c abundance of @xmath87 . since our c abundance is a @xmath88 upper limit , it does seem possible that the c / n decrease could be significantly greater than @xmath89  dex predicted by the sarna ( 1993 ) best - fitting model and it might be of interest to determine what changes to this model might accommodate a larger depletion .",
    "however , at the present day phase in its evolution , this model also predicts quite a steep decline in the c abundance and it seems plausible that a greater depletion in the c / n ratio might be accommodated by the model uncertainties .",
    "it is worth comparing the c / n ratio we have obtained for algol with the values expected in single g and k giants following convective dredge - up of cn - processed material during the ascent of the red giant branch .",
    "lambert & ries ( 1977,1981 ) obtained typical values by number of @xmath90 - 2 for a sample of field giants , to be compared with their adopted solar ( initial ) ratio of 4.8 , or a logarithmic change in the c / n ratio of @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "these values were in good agreement with the evolutionary models of dearborn , tinsley & schramm ( 1978 ) , which , for a star of mass @xmath91 and the same initial c / n ratio , predicted a surface abundance ratio of [ c / n]@xmath92 after dredge - up .",
    "following parthasarathy , lambert & tomkin ( 1983 ) , by adopting a crude two - zone model for the envelope and cn - processed shell we can make a very rough estimate of the fraction of mass lost from the star based on the ( assumed ) initial abundances and ( measured ) final abundances . in this model , one assumes that mass transferred onto algol  a is comprised of only pristine unprocessed material prior to deep mixing of envelope and processed core . at dredge - up , a remaining outer envelope of mass @xmath93 containing only unprocessed material",
    "is mixed with a mass @xmath94 of matter processed through the cn - cycle on the main - sequence .",
    "we can then equate the number of atoms of c or n per unit mass in the mixed material , @xmath95 , to the numbers per unit mass in the processed core , @xmath96 , and unprocessed envelope , @xmath97 , as follows : @xmath98 the ratio of the processed and unprocess masses is then simply @xmath99 since we have only an upper limit for the c abundance @xmath95 , i estimate @xmath100 based on the observed n abundance . as before , i adopt the initial solar c abundance of allende - prieto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and the n abundance of grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) .",
    "the observed n abundance is then [ n / h]@xmath101 , where the value in table  [ t : abuns ] has been lowered by 0.05  dex to be in accordance with the metallicity [ m / h]@xmath102 indicated for the adopted solar c and n abundances in figure  [ f : cn ] . assuming that in the processed mass @xmath94 essentially all the c is converted to n , the mass ratio given by equation  [ e : mass_rat ] is @xmath103 .    as pointed out by parthasarathy et al .",
    "( 1983 ) based on the work of iben ( 1967 ) , in the absence of strong mass loss , and over a fairly wide range of stellar masses , standard evolutionary models for intermediate mass stars such as the algol  b progenitor have an unprocessed envelope mass fraction of about half the total stellar mass , or @xmath104 .",
    "the simple two - zone model then provides a `` 0th order '' proof that algol  b must have lost nearly all of its outer envelope , or about half its mass .",
    "how applicable is such a simple two - zone model to algol ?",
    "it implicitly assumes that mass loss occurred only during a rapid phase that was short compared to evolutionary timescales .",
    "empirically , this can not be the case because the c abundance of algol  a indicates that he - rich material that induced thermohaline mixing must have been transferred , otherwise the surface abundances of the two stars would be about the same .",
    "such he - rich layers in algol  b also correspond to layers in which c and n abundances would have reached the equilibrium values of cn - processing , where c is reduced to about 3% of its initial value ( [ c / h]@xmath105 ) . the c abundance is larger than this equilibrium value because of mixing of the pristine envelope with the cn - processed layer during mass - transfer .",
    "the two - zone model estimate is therefore a lower limit to the actual mass loss .",
    "the model of sarna ( 1993 ) suggests an initial mass of algol  b of @xmath106 , to be compared with its present mass of @xmath107 ; in this non - conservative model , 15  %  of the total mass is lost to the system .",
    "prior to the chandra letgs observations , the only direct nucleosynthetic observational clue as to the past evolution of the algol system was the c abundance estimate for algol a of cugier & hardorp ( 1988 ) . as pointed out by sarna ( 1993 ) , this value remained too uncertain to be of quantitative value in constraining evolutionary models .",
    "the chandra observations present the first direct and definitive observational evidence of the strong modification of the surface c and n abundances of algol b through exposure to main - sequence nuclear burning and subsequent shedding of its outer envelope .",
    "these observations provide the best observational confirmation of theoretical models for the evolutionary history and present status of algol .",
    "the formal abundance results in table  [ t : abuns ] quote only statistical uncertainties , which are very small owing to the use of prominent and well - observed spectral features .",
    "the advantage of the relative study adopted here is that the uncertainties inherent in absolute abundance studies tend to cancel each other out because they are the same for both stars .",
    "these include uncertainties in the instrument calibration , in the measurement and extraction of line fluxes , and in the atomic data relevant for the radiative emission of interest .",
    "the largest uncertainties in this study instead arise from the two main assumptions adopted ( supplementary to the common underlying assumption that the sources can be adequately described by collision - dominated , optically thin plasmas , an assumption that we expect to be reasonably accurate ) .",
    "these are :    1 .",
    "the temperature dependences of the source dems are essentially the same ; and 2 .",
    "there is no strong differential compositional fractionation at work between the two stars , especially among c and n , so that inferred abundance differences represent underlying stellar compositional differences .",
    "these two assumptions are partly correlated : one might expect that any compositional fractionation at work in one corona might be duplicated in another that is in some respects very similar , provided the fractionation mechanism(s ) are at least partly dependent on the common parameters .",
    "i argue that this is indeed the case below .",
    "regarding the temperature structures of the source plasmas , it has been found that the ratios of he - like to h - like resonance lines in the abundant elements o , ne , mg , si , and s are very similar to within statistical uncertainties ( drake et al .  in preparation ) , with deviations typically of order 20  %  or less .",
    "these ratios are not sensitive to abundances but are quite sensitive to temperature . based on this evidence , provided assumption ( 2 )",
    "is valid , we might expect uncertainties in abundance ratios of order 0.1  dex to result from small differences in source temperature structure .",
    "the principal stellar parameters currently thought to drive coronal formation can be coarsely defined as spectral type and rotation rate . in this regard , the similarity in spectral type of the active subgiant primary in the hr  1099 system that dominates its coronal activity and algol b ( algol a being x - ray dark ) , together with their similar rotation periods , suggests at the outset that their coronae might also share very similar characteristics .",
    "further parameters for the x - ray dominant components are summarised in table  [ t : obs ] .",
    "these values indicate that , indeed , the effective temperatures appear to be consistent within experimental uncertainty , as , likely , are the masses and radii .",
    "these are known to an accuracy @xmath108  %  for algol ( e.g.  richards et al .",

    "2001 ) , in addition to outer atmosphere radiative loss rates .",
    "i address the stellar metallicities below ; again these appear to be similar in both stars .",
    "a further parameter is the he abundance , which is expected to be higher in algol b owing to a smaller dilution of h - burning products with an envelope depleted through mass transfer .",

    "s : comment ] .    in summary ,",
    "the remarkable similarity in the stellar parameters of active algol and hr  1099 components , as noted above , in addition to their identical rotation rates , leads me to suggest that their coronae are likely to be superficially identical .",
    "this conjecture is borne out in a detailed comparison of their x - ray spectra , in which variations in relative line intensities are generally well within a factor of two  see figure  [ f : spectra ] .",
    "similar conclusions were also reached in a comparison of radio observations of algol and hr  1099 by mutel et al .",
    "they found that the mean radio luminosity , luminosity distribution functions , and spectral index correlations with flux density from very long baseline array and green bank interferometer ( gbi ) observations were nearly indistinguishable . some difference in circular polarisation fraction",
    "was attributed naturally to differences in system inclination .",
    "some palpable differences have been found , however : richards , waltman & ghigo ( 2002 ) have recently presented evidence that apparent periodicities in radio flaring in the time from 1995 to 2000 at frequencies of 2.3  ghz and 8.3  ghz are different , with the strongest periodicities found being @xmath111 days and @xmath112 days for algol and hr  1099 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , all other characteristics appearing very similar , i feel that assumption ( 1 ) is justified and that , indeed , the temperature structures of the coronae of hr  1099 and algol are essentially the same .    the similarity in the x - ray spectra of these stars also argues against any significant role in coronal formation for their different roche lobe filling factors , or for the ongoing mass transfer in algol , again in agreement with the conclusions of mutel et al .",

    "are not generally expected to be so metal - poor .",
    "the best - fit evolutionary model of sarna ( 1993 ) suggests an age for algol of about 0.45  gyr ( see also nelson & eggleton 2001 whose best - fit model is 1.1  gyr old ) .",

    "we conclude , then , that fe is very likely depleted in the corona of algol b relative to the underlying star .",
    "a recent review of coronal abundance studies for rs  cvn systems for which estimates of both coronal and photospheric abundances exist also supports the idea that fe is in fact depleted in their coronae relative to their underlying photospheres , possibly by as much as 1  dex ( drake 2002 ) .",
    "there are no definitive photospheric abundance studies that tell us whether or not this is also the case for hr  1099 .",
    "in addition , the evolutionary status of hr  1099 is more difficult to infer than for algol because derived stellar masses are dependent on the adopted system inclination ( e.g.  fekel 1983 ; donati 1999 ) . if the estimate of @xmath116 for the primary listed in table  [",

    "however , ottmann et al .  (",
    "1998 ) have refuted claims of significant metal paucity for some systems in the randich et al.(1994 ) sample based on more extensive spectroscopic analyses , while a detailed study of the ar  lac secondary by gehren ( 1999 ) that obtained [ fe / h]=0 , in contrast to the result [ fe / h]@xmath121 of naftilan & drake ( 1977 ) , casts doubt on the reality of true intra - binary photospheric abundance differences .",

    "it is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the true photospheric metallicity of hr  1099 based on this summary of disparate results . clearly , the issue of possible abundance differences between primary and secondary components of close binaries warrants further study : if true , such differences would provide a strong challenge to structural and evolutionary models for such systems . at present , i appeal to the differential nature of this study and tentatively suggest that hr  1099 is not significantly more metal - poor than algol , and that the very similar x - ray dominant components of these systems are undergoing very similar fractionation processes that results in fe being depleted in their coronae by of order 0.5  dex .",
    "in addition to this apparent depletion of fe , the recent chandra and xmm - newton studies of hr  1099 based on high resolution x - ray spectra ( drake et al .",
    "2001 , brinkman et al .",

    "in their comparative analysis of x - ray observations of algol - type and rs  cvn - type systems , singh et al .  ( 1996 ) noted that the algols appeared systematically fainter in x - rays than the rs  cvn s , even after allowing for the likely x - ray dark nature of the primaries of the former systems . by comparing x - ray luminosity to roche lobe filling factors , singh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ruled out mass transfer and accretion in the algol systems as significant factors in their x - ray luminosity `` deficiency '' .",
    "sarna et al .  (",
    "1998 ) have successfully explained the gross characteristics of the large x - ray luminosity differences among algol - type systems in terms of convection zone parameters responsible for generating magnetic flux within an @xmath9-@xmath145 dynamo formalism .",

    "one conspicuous difference between the rs  cvn s and the algols is the mass transfer history of the secondaries of the latter .",
    "loss of a substantial fraction of the outer envelope leads to less dilution of the layers processed by main - sequence nuclear burning , as is manifest in the c / n abundance ratio . while trace elements such as c and n will have little effect on a star or its corona , another element whose surface abundance can be substantially altered is he .",
    "it was shown by drake ( 1998 ) that a corona substantially enhanced in he might appear metal - poor owing to the dependence of thermal bremsstrahlung on the square of the nuclear charge : the enhanced continuum lowers the line - to - continuum ratio . in the algol case , however , drake ( 1998 ) also noted that the large he abundance should not appreciably change the emitting characteristics of the corona .",
    "this is because the enhancement in he occurs at the expense of the loss of h , where four h nuclei are transformed into one he nucleus . in this case",
    ", the line - to - continuum ratio remains about the same because the he continuum emissivity is four times that of h. the net emissivity of coronal plasma therefore remains about the same .",
    "instead , i speculate that raising the he abundance could affect the corona in two possible ways : ( i ) through changes in the convective envelope in which magnetic fields thought to fuel a corona are generated ; ( ii ) through a possible dependence of the coronal heating efficiency on the he abundance or plasma mean molecular weight .",

    "i have investigated the c and n abundances in the corona of algol  b through a differential study relative to hr  1099 .",
    "chandra letg spectra obtained for both stars during times of quiescence show that the temperature structure and abundances in these coronae are very similar , in accordance with naive expectations based on the similarity of the parameters of the stars that dominate the x - ray emission .",
    "the differential analysis presented here therefore avoids errors associated with determining the underlying dem , in addition to all systematic uncertainties involving atomic data , line flux measurement and instrument calibration .",
    "the c / n abundance ratio in hr  1099 is found to be consistent with that of the solar photosphere , and no evidence is found for modification of the surface abundances of the x - ray - dominant subgiant through cn - cycle processing .",
    "the difference between this conclusion and that of schmitt & ness ( 2002 ) , who concluded that these elements exhibited signs of cn - processing , can be attributable to adoption of a different solar abundance for c. in contrast , c is not detected in the corona of algol and n appears enhanced relative to hr  1099 by a factor of 2 .",
    "the change in the c / n abundance ratio in the atmosphere of algol  b as a result of cn - cycle processing is found to be @xmath146 .",
    "based on this result , a simple two - zone model demonstrates that algol  b must have lost at least half of its original mass .",
    "this result is also consistent with predictions of detailed evolutionary models for algol computed by sarna ( 1993 ) in which algol  b has an initial mass of @xmath147 and loses about @xmath148 .    a detailed examination of the abundance patterns in hr  1099 and algol  b for elements fe",
    ", ne and o confirms that they have very similar fractionation patters , consistent with the view that they are `` coronal twins '' .",
    "consideration of the likely photospheric abundances for these stars leads to the conclusion that fe must be depleted in their coronae relative to photospheric values by about 0.5  dex .",
    "one notable difference in their coronal properties will be an enhanced he abundance in the corona algol  b owing to the mixing of the products of core h - burning into the remnant envelope .",
    "i speculate that the enhanced he abundance in some algol systems might explain some of the previously observed x - ray deficiency of these systems as compared to similar rs  cvn - type binaries .",
    "i would like to express warm gratitude to dr .",
    "v.  kashyap for helpful comments , and to m.  sarna for communicating his unpublished model n abundances for algol  b and for his stimulating remarks .",
    "a helpful review from an anonymous referee enabled me to improve the manuscript and include some relevant issues i had not considered .",
    "i also thank the nasa aisrp for providing financial assistance for the development of the pintofale package , and the chianti project for making publicly available the results of their substantial effort in assembling atomic data useful for coronal plasma analysis .",
