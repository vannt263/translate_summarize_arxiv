    "complex networked systems represent better than any other the idea of complexity . when looking at their large scale topological properties , real networks are far more complex than classical random graphs @xcite , showing emerging properties not obvious at the level of their elementary constituents the small - world effect , scale - free connectivity , clustering , degree correlations , etc . when looking at the dynamical processes that take place on top of them , these large scale topological properties have striking consequences on the behavior of the system absence of epidemic threshold , resilience to damage , etc .",
    "the understanding that many real world systems of interacting elements can be mapped into graphs or networks has led to a surge of interest in the field of complex networks and to the development of a theoretical frameworks able to properly analyze them @xcite . under this approach",
    ", the elements of the system are mapped into vertices whereas interactions among these elements are represented as edges , or links , among vertices of the network .    in an attempt to bring nearer theory and reality ,",
    "many researchers working on the new rapidly evolving science of complex networks have recently shifted focus from unweighted graphs to weighted networks@xcite .",
    "commonly , interactions between elements in network - representable complex real systems -may they be communication systems , such as the internet , or transportation infrastructures , social communities , biological or biochemical systems- are not of the same magnitude .",
    "it seems natural that the first more simple representations , where edges between pairs of vertices are quantified just as present or absent , give way to more complex ones , where edges are no longer in binary states but may stand for connections of different strength .    in an unweighted network ,",
    "all the topological properties can be expressed as a function of the adjacency matrix , @xmath0 , whose elements take the value @xmath1 when vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 are connected by an edge and @xmath4 otherwise . using this matrix ,",
    "the degree of a vertex the number of neighbors or connections it has becomes @xmath5 the distribution of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is called the degree distribution of the network , and it arises as the most fundamental topological characteristic .",
    "surprisingly , in a vast majority of cases , real networks show degree distributions following power laws of the form @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that the second moment of the degree distribution , @xmath11 , diverges in the thermodynamic limit , which causes the loss of any characteristic degree scale .",
    "for this reason , these class of networks are called scale - free ( sf ) .",
    "this feature of the degree distribution is , eventually , the responsible for the surprising behavior of dynamical processes that run on top of these networks .    for weighted networks ,",
    "the adjacency matrix is no longer the fundamental quantity ruling the properties of the network .",
    "instead , we have to consider the matrix @xmath12 , which measures the weight between the pair of vertices @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that is , the magnitude of the connection between @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". the analogous quantity to the vertex degree is now the vertex strength , defined as @xmath13 this quantity measures the total strength of vertex @xmath2 as the sum of the weights of all its connections .",
    "if the weights of a given vertex are not correlated with the vertex degree , the average strength of a vertex of degree @xmath6 is simply given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the average weight of the edges of the network .",
    "in this situation , strength and degree are proportional and weights do not incorporate more information to the network than that already present in the adjacency matrix .",
    "real networks show , however , a very different scaling , with a non trivial relation between strength and degree of the form @xmath16 with @xmath17 ( typically @xmath18 ) .",
    "this anomalous scaling reveals the presence of correlations between strength and degree and , thus , the need to model network formation in an weighted basis , where the evolution of the network is linked to the evolution of the weights assigned to connections . in this paper , we present a model of weighted network based on the configuration model . we shall show that , when the expected degree sequence follows a power law with exponent smaller than 2 , the resulting network is weighted and shows a non trivial scaling between strength and degree .",
    "the configuration model was first introduced as an algorithm to generate uncorrelated random networks with a given degree distribution , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the model operates in two steps :    * we start assigning to each vertex @xmath2 , out of a set of @xmath19 , a number of `` stubs '' , @xmath6 , drawn from the distribution @xmath7 , under the constraint that the sum @xmath20 is even .",
    "* pairs of these stubs are chosen uniformly at random and the corresponding vertices are connected by an undirected edge .    given the random nature of the edge assignment , this algorithm generates networks with the expected degree distribution and no correlations between the degrees of connected vertices .",
    "the model , as described above , allows the formation of multiple or self connections among vertices . nevertheless , when the expected degree distribution has bounded fluctuations , the number of such `` pathological '' connections is small an can be neglected in the thermodynamic limit . in this case , one can add an extra constraint in step two of the algorithm avoiding multiple or self connections without modifying the resulting network .",
    "the picture changes drastically when the expected degree distribution has unbounded fluctuations .",
    "this is precisely the case of sf distributions with exponent @xmath21 $ ] . in this situation ,",
    "vertices with expected degree satisfying @xmath22 can not avoid to form multiple connections .",
    "indeed , as it was proved in @xcite , the number of multiple connections in this case scales as @xmath23 .",
    "yet the situation is not so dramatic since the overall number of connections is much larger that the number of multiple connections .",
    "however , one has to be careful because the `` hubs '' of the network those in the tail of the distribution are precisely the ones more prone to hold multiple connections and , therefore , it could alter the results of dynamical processes evaluated on top of these class of networks .",
    "there are two strategies one can follow in order to avoid multiple connections :    * one can introduce a constraint in step two prohibiting multiple connections .",
    "this has the side effect of introducing strong disassortative degree correlations among connected vertices .",
    "* alternatively , one can introduce a cut - off in the distribution @xmath7 scaling as @xmath24 . by doing so",
    ", one recovers uncorrelated networks but with a smaller cut - off than the natural one @xcite .",
    "the configuration model with expected degree distribution with @xmath26 has not been studied so forth .",
    "this is an extreme situation in which the number of multiple connections can not be neglected .",
    "we can take advantage of this fact to construct a weighted network , where the weight between a pair of vertices is the number of multiple connections they have @xcite .",
    "now , the expected quantity of a given vertex is no longer its degree but its strength",
    ". therefore , let us change notation and denote by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the distribution of expected strengths , that is , the number of expected connections of vertices .    at the level of strength , vertices are uncorrelated and the average weight of edges linking nodes of strengths @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total number of connections regardless they are multiple or not in the network , that is , @xmath33 the average degree of a vertex can be obtained as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the first term in this equation is the contribution of those connections that , on average , are smaller than 1 .",
    "the second term represents connections with an average number larger than 1 and , thus , holding multiple connections . in this case , the contribution to the degree is just 1 and not @xmath36 . using the expression for the weights , eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) , in the continuum limit we can write @xmath37 that , in the thermodynamic limit goes as @xmath38 it is worth noticing that there are finite size effects that depend on the specific form of the strength distribution .",
    "the model generates a non trivial weighted network with an exponent @xmath39 larger than 1 , as it is observed in real weighted networks @xcite .",
    "the tail of the degree distribution can be obtained from this scaling relation , yielding an exponent @xmath25 .",
    "thus , even though the expected strength distribution has an exponent smaller than two , the resulting network has exponent equal to two and a number of connections growing as @xmath40 .    , used in the simulations .",
    "the solid lines correspond to the theoretical curves given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) ]",
    ", @xmath41 , as a function of @xmath42 , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the size of the network is @xmath46 . in all cases ,",
    "the strength distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) with @xmath47 .",
    "solid lines correspond to the best fit estimates ( numbers in parenthesis into the legend box ) of the theoretical behavior @xmath48 . ]    to test the results of our analysis , we have performed numerical simulations of the configuration model , generating expected strength distributions of the form @xmath49 the value of @xmath50 modulates the probability to find strengths of value larger than @xmath1 .",
    "we choose this particular form because , by an appropriate choice of @xmath50 , the finite size effects are minimized . in all the simulations ,",
    "the size of the network is @xmath46 , the values of @xmath51 are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath47 .",
    "we first show , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the cumulative strength distributions used in the simulations as compared to the theoretical ones , @xmath55 computed using the continuum approximation .    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the scaling relation between @xmath41 and the strength @xmath42 .",
    "as it can be seen , the theoretical prediction @xmath56 is well satisfied , with the following estimates for the exponent @xmath57 : @xmath58 for @xmath45 , @xmath59 for @xmath44 , and @xmath60 for @xmath43 .",
    "finally , the resulting cumulative degree distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , showing that this function goes , for large degrees , as @xmath61 independent of @xmath51 , as predicted by our analysis .    , generated by de model .",
    "the solid line is power law of the form @xmath61 corresponding to an exponent @xmath25 . ]",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the behavior of the classical configuration model in the case of expected strength distributions following a power law form of exponent smaller than two .",
    "we have shown that , in this case , the resulting network is weighted , where the weight stands for the number of multiple connections among vertices . the model presents a non trivial scaling relation between strength and degree and a degree distribution with exponent @xmath25 , independent of the exponent of the strength distribution , @xmath51 .",
