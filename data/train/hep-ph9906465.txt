    "@xmath0 boson , electrically neutral vector boson ( its spin equals 1 ) with mass @xmath28 gev and width @xmath29 gev , .",
    "] occupies a unique place in physics .",
    "this heavy analog of the photon was experimentally discovered in 1983 , practically simultaneously with its charged counterparts @xmath30 bosons with mass @xmath31 gev and width @xmath32 gev @xcite .",
    "the discovery was crowned by nobel prize to carlo rubbia ( for the bosons ) and to simon van der meer ( for the cern proton - antiproton collider , which was specially constructed to produce @xmath33 and @xmath0 bosons ) @xcite .",
    "the extremely short - lived vector bosons ( @xmath34 sec ) were detected by their decays into various leptons and hadrons .",
    "the detectors , in which these decay products were observed , were built and operated by collaborations of physicists and engineers the largest in the previous history of physics .",
    "the discovery of @xmath33 and @xmath0 bosons was a great triumph of experimental physics , but even more so of theoretical physics .",
    "the masses and widths of the particles , the cross - sections of their production turned out to be in perfect agreement with the predictions of electroweak theory of sheldon glashow , abdus salam and steven weinberg @xcite .",
    "the theory was so beautiful that its authors received the nobel prize already in 1979 @xcite , four years before its crucial confirmation .",
    "the electroweak theory unified two types of fundamental interactions : electromagnetic and weak .",
    "the theory of electromagnetic interaction  quantum electrodynamics , or qed , was cast in its present relativistically covariant form in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s and served as a  role model \" for the relativistic field theories of two other fundamental interactions : weak and strong .",
    "the main virtue of qed was its renormalizability .",
    "let us explain this  technical \" term by using the example of interaction of photons with electrons .",
    "one can find systematic presentation in modern textbooks @xcite . in the lowest approximation of perturbation theory ( the so called tree approximation in the language of feynman diagrams ) all electromagnetic phenomena can be described in terms of electric charge and mass of the electron ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "the small parameter of perturbation theory is the famous @xmath37 .",
    "the problem with any quantum field theory is that in higher orders of perturbation theory , described by feynman graphs with loops , the integrals over momenta of virtual particles have ultraviolet divergences , so that all physical quantities including electric charge and mass of the electron themselves become infinitely large . to avoid infinities an ultraviolet cut - off @xmath38",
    "could be introduced .",
    "another , more sophisticated method is to use dimensional regularization : to calculate the feynman integrals in momentum space of @xmath39 dimensions .",
    "these integrals diverge at @xmath40 , but are finite , proportional to @xmath41 in vicinity of @xmath40 , where by definition @xmath42 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the theory is called renormalizable , if one can get rid of this cut - off ( or @xmath41 ) by establishing relations between observables only . in the case of electrons and photons such basic observables are physical ( renormalized ) charge and mass of the electron .",
    "this allows to calculate higher order effects in @xmath43 and compare the theoretical predictions with the results of high precision measurements of such observables as e.g. anomalous magnetic moments of electron or muon .",
    "the renormalizability of electrodynamics is guaranteed by the dimensionless nature of the coupling constant @xmath43 and by conservation of electric current .    after this short description of qed",
    "let us turn to the weak interaction .",
    "the first manifestation of the weak interaction was discovered by henri becquerel at the end of the xix century .",
    "later this type of radioactivity was called @xmath44-decay .",
    "the first theory of @xmath44-decay was proposed by enrico fermi in 1934 @xcite .",
    "the theory was modelled after quantum electrodynamics with two major differences : first , instead of charge conserving , ",
    "neutral \" , electrical current of the type @xmath45 there were introduced two charge changing ,  charged \" , vector currents : one for nucleons , transforming neutron into a proton , @xmath46 , another for leptons , transforming neutrino into electron or creating a pair : electron plus antineutrino , @xmath47 .",
    "( here @xmath48 denotes operator , which creates ( annihilates ) electron and annihilates ( creates ) positron .",
    "the symbols of other particles have similar meaning ; @xmath49 are four dirac matrices , @xmath50 . )",
    "the second difference between the fermi theory and electrodynamics was that the charged currents interacted locally via four fermion interaction : @xmath51 where summation over index @xmath43 is implied ( in this summation we use feynman s convention : @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 ) ; h.c .",
    "means hermitian conjugate .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath56 of this interaction was called fermi coupling constant .    from simple dimensional considerations",
    "it is evident that dimension of @xmath56 is ( mass)@xmath57 and therefore the four - fermion interaction is not renormalizable , the higher orders being divergent as @xmath58 , @xmath59 ... .",
    "why these divergent corrections still allow one to rely on the lowest order approximation , remained a mystery .",
    "but for many years the lowest order four - fermion interaction served as a successful phenomenological theory of weak interactions .",
    "it is in the framework of this phenomenological theory that a number of subsequent experimental discoveries were accommodated .",
    "first , it turned out that @xmath44-decay is one of the large family of weak processes , involving newly discovered particles , such as pions , muons and muonic neutrinos , strange particles , etc .",
    "second , it was discovered that all these processes are caused by selfinteraction of one weak charged current , involving leptonic and hadronic terms .",
    "later on , when the quark structure of hadrons was established , the hadronic part of the current was expressed through corresponding quark current .",
    "third , it was established in 1957 that all weak interactions violate parity conservation @xmath60 and charge conjugation invariance @xmath61 .",
    "this violation turned out to have a universal pattern : the vector form of the current @xmath62 , introduced by fermi , was substituted @xcite by one half of the sum of vector and axial vector , @xmath63 , which meant that @xmath49 should be substituted by @xmath64 .",
    "in other words one can say that fermion @xmath65 enters the charged current only through its left - handed chiral component @xmath66    from such structure of the charged current it follows that the corresponding antifermions interact only through their right - handed components .",
    "attempts to construct a renormalizable theory of weak interaction resulted in a unified theory of electromagnetic and weak interactions",
    " the electroweak theory @xcite with two major predictions .",
    "the first prediction was the existence alongside with the charged weak current also of a neutral weak current .",
    "the second prediction was the existence of the vector bosons : @xmath0 coupled to the weak neutral current and @xmath67 and @xmath68 coupled to the charged current ( like @xmath69 ) and its hermitian conjugate current ( like @xmath70 ) .",
    "the vector bosons were massive analogues of the photon @xmath71 ; their couplings to the corresponding currents , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , were the analogues of the electric charge @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath74 and @xmath75 were dimensionless like @xmath76 , which was a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition of renormalizability of the weak interaction .",
    "the first theory , involving charged vector bosons and photon , was proposed by oscar klein just before world war ii @xcite .",
    "klein based his theory on the notion of local isotopic symmetry : he considered isotopic doublets @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and isotopic triplet @xmath79 . where @xmath80 denoted what we call now @xmath30 , while @xmath81 was electromagnetic field .",
    "he also mentioned the possibility to incorporate a neutral massive field @xmath82 ( the analogue of our @xmath83 ) . in fact",
    "this was the first attempt to construct a theory based on a non - abelian gauge symmetry , with vector fields playing the role of gauge fields .",
    "the gauge symmetry was essential for conservation of the currents .",
    "unfortunately , klein did not discriminate between weak and strong interaction and his paper was firmly forgotten .",
    "the non - abelian gauge theory was rediscovered in 1954 by c.n.yang and r.mills @xcite and became the basis of the so - called standard model with its colour @xmath84 group for strong interaction of quarks and gluons and @xmath85 group for electroweak interaction ( here indices denote : @xmath86  colour , @xmath87  weak isospin of left - handed spinors , and @xmath88  the weak hypercharge ) . the electric charge @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the third projection of isospin .",
    "@xmath91 for a doublet of quarks , @xmath92 for a doublet of leptons . as for the right - handed spinors , they are isosinglets , and hence @xmath93 thus",
    ", parity violation and charge conjugation violation were incorporated into the foundation of electroweak theory .    out of the four fields (",
    "three of @xmath94 and one of @xmath95 , usually denoted by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively ) only two directly correspond to the observed vector bosons : @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath83 boson and photon are represented by two orthogonal superpositions of @xmath98 and @xmath97 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , while the weak angle @xmath102 is a free parameter of electroweak theory .",
    "the value of @xmath102 is determined from experimental data on @xmath0 boson coupling to neutral current .",
    "the  @xmath0-charge \" , characterizing the coupling of @xmath0 boson to a spinor with definite helicity is given by @xmath103 where the values of the corresponding charges at @xmath2-scale , while @xmath35 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 refer to values at vanishing momentum transfer .",
    "the same refers to @xmath22 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath43 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( see below eqs .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) - ( [ 18 ] ) ) . ]",
    "@xmath108    note that the  @xmath0-charge \" is different for the right- and left - handed spinors with the same value of @xmath109 because they have different values of @xmath90 .",
    "the coupling constant of @xmath33-bosons is also expressed in terms of @xmath110 and @xmath102 : @xmath111    the theory described above has many nice features , the most important of which is its renormalizability .",
    "but at first sight it looks absolutely useless : all fermions and bosons in it are massless .",
    "this drawback can not be fixed by simply adding mass terms to the lagrangian .",
    "the mass terms of fermions would contain both @xmath112 and @xmath113 and thus explicitly break the isotopic invariance and hence renormalizability .",
    "the gauge invariance would also be broken by the mass terms of the vector bosons .",
    "all this would result in divergences of the type @xmath114 , @xmath115 , etc .",
    "the way out of this trap is the so called higgs mechanism @xcite . in the framework of the minimal standard model",
    "the problem of mass is solved by postulating the existence of the doublet @xmath116 and corresponding antidoublet @xmath117 of spinless particles .",
    "these four bosons differ from all other particles by the form of their self - interaction , the energy of which is minimal when the neutral field @xmath118 has a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value .",
    "the isospin of the higgs doublet is @xmath119 , its hypercharge is @xmath120 .",
    "thus , it interacts with all four gauge bosons .",
    "in particular , it has quartic terms @xmath121 ,   @xmath122 , which give masses to the vector bosons when @xmath123 acquires its vacuum expectation value ( _ vev _ ) @xmath124 : @xmath125 the magnitude of @xmath124 can easily be derived from that of the four - fermion interaction constant @xmath1 in muon decay : @xmath126 in the born approximation of electroweak theory this four - fermion interaction is caused by an exchange of a virtual @xmath33-boson ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "hence holds , see below , eqs .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) - ( [ 25 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath127    such mechanism of appearance of masses of @xmath33 and @xmath0 bosons is called spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "it preserves renormalizability @xcite .",
    "( as a hint , one can use the symmetrical form of lagrangian by not specifying the _ vev _ @xmath124 . )",
    "the fermion masses can be introduced also without explicitly breaking the gauge symmetry . in this case",
    "the mass arises from an isotopically invariant term @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is called yukawa coupling .",
    "the mass of a fermion @xmath130 .",
    "there is a separate yukawa coupling for each of the known fermions .",
    "their largely varying values are at present free parameters of the theory and await for the understanding of this hierarchy .",
    "let us return for a moment to the vector bosons .",
    "a massless vector boson ( e.g. photon ) has two spin degrees of freedom  two helicity states .",
    "a massive vector boson has three spin degrees of freedom corresponding , say , projections @xmath131 on its momentum . under spontaneous symmetry breaking three out of four spinless states ,",

    "the discovery of this particle is crucial for testing the correctness of msm .",
    "the first successful test of electroweak theory was provided by the discovery of neutral currents in the interaction of neutrinos with nucleons @xcite .",

    "a few other neutral current interactions have been discovered and studied : neutrino - electron scattering @xcite , parity violating electron - nucleon scattering at high energies @xcite , parity violation in atoms @xcite .",
    "all of them turned out to be in agreement with electroweak theory .",
    "a predominant part of theoretical work on electroweak corrections prior to the discovery of the @xmath33 and @xmath0 bosons was devoted to calculating the neutrino - electron @xcite and especially nucleon - electron @xcite interaction cross sections .    after the discovery of @xmath33 and @xmath0 bosons it became evident that the next level in the study of electroweak physics must consist in precision measurements of production and decays of @xmath0 bosons in order to test the electroweak radiative correction . for such measurements",
    "special electron - positron colliders slc ( at slac ) and lep - i ( at cern ) were constructed and started to operate in the fall of 1989 .",
    "slc had one intersection point of colliding beams and hence one detector ( sld ) ; lep - i had four intersection points and four detectors : aleph , delphi , l3 , opal .    in connection with the construction of lep and slc , a number of teams of theorists carried out detailed calculations of the required radiative corrections .",
    "these calculations were discussed and compared at special workshops and meetings .",
    "the result of this work was the publication of two so - called ` cern yellow reports ' @xcite , @xcite , which , together with the ` yellow report ' @xcite , became the ` must ' books for experimentalists and theoreticians studying the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the book @xcite ( which should be published in 1999 ) summarizes results of theoretical studies .",
    "more than 2.000 experimentalists and engineers and hundreds of theorists participated in this unique collective quest for truth !",
    "the sum of energies of @xmath138 was chosen to be equal to the @xmath0 boson mass .",
    "lep - i was terminated in the fall of 1995 in order to give place to lep - ii , which will operate in the same tunnel till 2001 with maximal energy @xmath139 gev .",

    "the first step in the theoretical analysis is to separate genuinely electroweak effects from purely electromagnetic ones , such as real photons emitted by initial and final particles in reaction ( [ 10 ] ) and virtual photons emitted and absorbed by them .",

    "all formulas of this appendix are valid at one electroweak loop approximation .    a set of three parameters @xmath507 , @xmath508 , @xmath509 has been suggested by altarelli , barbieri and jadach @xcite for phenomenological analysis of new physics : @xmath510 @xmath511 @xmath512 where @xmath513 describes the correction to @xmath391 , @xmath514 to @xmath392 and @xmath515 to @xmath17 : @xmath516 @xmath517 @xmath518 \\;\\ ; . \\label{t.6}\\ ] ]        as is evident from the last two formulas , the virtue of @xmath508 and @xmath509 is that they do not contain the term @xmath13 .",
    "so , at the time when top - quark mass was not measured at tevatron the corresponding uncertainties in @xmath508 and @xmath509 were diminished .",
    "another set of parameters , @xmath528 , @xmath529 , @xmath530 was introduced a few years earlier by peskin and takeuchi @xcite .",
    "these parameters were proposed to describe only the so - called oblique corrections due to the physics beyond the standard model . using the definitions of @xmath528 , @xmath529 , @xmath530 from @xcite and designating new physics contributions to @xmath531 as @xmath532",
    "we obtain : @xmath533 @xmath534 @xmath535      according to @xcite @xmath540=16\\pi [ \\sigma'_a(0)-\\sigma'_v(0 ) ] \\;\\ ; , \\label{t.19}\\ ] ] @xmath541 \\;\\ ; , \\label{t.20}\\ ] ] @xmath542 \\;\\ ; , \\label{t.21}\\ ] ] where @xmath543 and @xmath544 s are defined by the corresponding currents ( isotopic , 1 and 3 , and electromagnetic , @xmath109 , vector , @xmath62 , and axial , @xmath63 ) with coupling constants being extracted .",
    "thus @xmath528 characterizes the degree of chiral symmetry breaking , while both @xmath529 and @xmath530 that of isotopic symmetry .",
    "note that in eqs.([t.19 ] ) - ( [ t.21 ] ) only the contribution of new physics should be considered . since",
    "new particles should be heavy it is reasonable to take into account only values of self - energies at @xmath347 and their first derivatives ( higher derivatives are power suppressed ) @xcite .",
    "altogether we have eight parameters ( @xmath545 , @xmath546 , @xmath547 , @xmath548 , @xmath549 , @xmath550 , @xmath551 , @xmath552 ) , two of which are equal zero ( @xmath548 and @xmath547 ) , while three combinations can be absorbed in the definition of @xmath43 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the remaining three combinations enter @xmath528 , @xmath529 and @xmath530 ( or @xmath532 , @xmath553 ) .",
