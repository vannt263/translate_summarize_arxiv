    "the mobile communication networks face the challenge of utilizing limited spectrum and energy to meet the demand of rapid traffic growth . in the conventional cellular networks ,",
    "each base station takes care of the coverage as well as the traffic in its own cell . to cope with exponentially increasing traffic demand of mobile internet services  @xcite , more base stations are to be deployed densely",
    "it leads to large energy consumption , more inter - cell interference , and frequent handovers  @xcite .",
    "base station sleeping is proposed to increase the energy efficiency , but can possibly generate wireless coverage holes which is unacceptable in practical system .",
    "base station cooperation can be used to mitigate inter - cell interference , but the scheduling of adjacent cells is hard due to lack of global view . besides , frequent handovers increase the signaling overhead , rendering the system less efficient .",
    "the framework of hyper - cellular network aims at solving above problems by separating the coverage of control channel and data channel  @xcite . in the hyper - cellular network , signaling splitting is realized with two types of base stations : signaling base station ( sbs ) and data base station ( dbs ) .",
    "the sbs is responsible for the control coverage , while dbss take care of the data traffic demand and are deployed more densely . taking advantage of the space time variation of data traffic , the dbss can be dynamically switched on and off or scheduled to provide coordinated transmission under the sbs s command . by signaling splitting , hyper - cellular network can mitigate the signaling overhead and make the system globally resource optimized and energy efficient .",
    "hyper - cellular network is a novel framework concept and the related study focuses on the initial feasibility tests and simulations . in the conceptual study based on lte network",
    "@xcite huawei researchers propose to separate control and data by network functionalities .",
    "their numerical results show great reduction of energy consumption of the separation scheme compared to the tradition lte networks . however , no system implementation of the hyper - cellular architecture is available in the literature to our knowledge .",
    "another question to the novel architecture is whether present wireless protocols can be upgraded gradually to deploy the signaling splitting scheme .",
    "the current cellular network is effectively a mixed system with various protocols such as gsm , wcmda , and lte - a .",
    "it will be a big incentive to attract the mobile operators and device vendors to adopt the hyper - cellular architecture if the current running system can be smoothly upgraded .",
    "the paper takes gsm protocol as a case study and presents a working demonstration of hyper - cellular network in which signaling splitting scheme is implemented on a software defined radio platform .",
    "software defined radio originally means to move physical layer functions from dedicated hardware to programmable software in the radio communication system  @xcite .",
    "now its application has been extended to validate novel algorithms , realize full wireless protocol stack , and implement state of the art wireless systems  @xcite . the flexibility , rapid development and deployment , ease of programming as well as low cost make software defined radio a promising technology to power up new wireless communication systems .",
    "in this paper we focus on the gsm air interface to study the realizability of signal splitting of hyper - cellular network .",
    "a working system is designed and implemented on openbts to prove the feasibility .",
    "openbts is a unix application which implements the gsm air interface with software defined radio technology  @xcite .",
    "the public release is a free and open source software intended for education , experimentation , and research projects .",
    "it can run on a commodity pc and functions as a gsm base transceiver station which allows standard handsets to register on its network , make phone calls , and send text messages .",
    "it uses asterisk  @xcite , a software pbx , to switch traffic between different users , therefore the necessity of traditional core network equipment such as bsc and msc is eliminated . with a voip service provider , it can connect phone calls with various sip services and traditional cellular networks run by carriers .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the system structure and base station operation of hyper - cellular network .",
    "section 3 describes the gsm air interface and propose our decoupling scheme of signaling and data .",
    "we provide the system implementation on openbts in section 4 .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "hyper - cellular network emphasizes the separation of control channel and data channel in the air interface and demands two types of base stations .",
    "since the network coverage is taken care of by signaling base stations , data base stations can be switched off and go to sleep to save energy when there is no traffic demand , and they can also be scheduled to provide coordinated transmission to multiple users in multiple cells to mitigate the inter - cell interference and improve the quality of service ( qos ) . in the typical settings as in fig .",
    "[ fig : overview ] the signaling base station has a larger coverage where multiple data base stations reside and are scheduled by the signaling base station .    the signaling base station is responsible for the control coverage . when a mobile handset is powered on and scans for existing network , the signaling base station is supposed to check its identity and decide whether or not to allow its camping .",
    "once registered , the mobile user s network coverage will be handled by the signaling base station .",
    "the context information is maintained between the mobile user and the signaling base station , which does not involve the nearby data base stations .",
    "the data base stations will be active only when there is data traffic service associated .",
    "[ fig : mos ] shows the information flow between the mobile user , the signaling base station and the data base stations in the mobile originated service scenario .",
    "when the mobile user initiates data service , it will send the channel request to the signaling base station .",
    "the signaling base station will try to find one or more active data base stations to serve the mobile user depending on the system information .",
    "if the active data base stations are all of high load but there are data base stations in sleep mode , the signaling base station will try to wake up one or more sleeping data base stations .",
    "if there is no data base station available to provide the service , the signaling base station will reject the mobile user s request .",
    "once the appointed data base stations respond , the signaling base station will inform the mobile user of the channel information of the granted access .",
    "then the direct link between the mobile user and data base stations will be established , followed by data traffic transmission .    the case for mobile terminated service",
    "is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mts ] and explained as follows .",
    "when the mobile user has passive data service demand such as an incoming call , it will receive the paging frames from the signaling base station and then request necessary channel for the service . the signaling base station will try to appoint one or more available data base stations .",
    "after receiving the response of data base stations , the signaling base station will inform the mobile user of the assigned channel .",
    "then the mobile user will acknowledge the paging to the data base stations .",
    "next the appointed data base stations will establish the direct link to the mobile user and provide the data traffic service .",
    "the gsm air interface , namely um , defines the layered structure , the frame structure , and logical channels .",
    "the um layers roughly corresponds to the bottom three layers of the osi model .",
    "the frequency band is divided by fdma into independent channels numbered by arfcn .",
    "tdma is used to divide a frame into 8 time slots , each with the duration 0.577  ms .",
    "tdma frames can be grouped to multiframes , and further to superframes and hyperframes .",
    "the standard defines multiple logical channels which are categorized into traffic channels ( tch ) and control channels ( cch ) .",
    "the control channels can be divided into three groups : broadcast channels ( bch ) including bcch , fcch , and sch ; common control channels ( ccch ) consisting of pch , nch , rach , and agch ; dedicated control channels ( dcch ) which include sdcch , sacch , and facch  @xcite .",
    "when the logical channels are mapped to the physical channel , only certain combinations of logical channels are permitted according to the specification .",
    "for example there are tch+sacch , fcch+sch+bcch+ccch , and sdcch+sacch among common combinations  @xcite .",
    "after the mapping the signaling in the control channel and the data in the traffic channel are coupled together in the traditional gsm cellular system .",
    "hyper - cellular network aims at decoupling signaling and data at the air interface to enable dynamic network operation and soft resource matching .",
    "when applying the signaling splitting concept into practical system , we follow the principle of decoupling as much as possible while ensuring smoothly upgradable .",
    "thorough separation maximizes the benefits of simplification and specific optimization of two types of base stations , but might be impractical to migrate existing system smoothly .",
    "the ability of upgrading smoothly is highly attractive to network operators .",
    "no modification on the user equipment side is appreciated as it brings no breakage to device vendors and mobile users thus speeding up the migration .",
    "our signaling splitting scheme of gsm air interface is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : functionality ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : logical ] . from the view of network functionalities ,",
    "the signaling base station takes care of synchronization , system information broadcasting , and paging , while the data base station just handles data traffic services . in the aspect of logical channels , bch and ccch",
    "are of the signaling base station s responsibility , while tch only resides at the data base station .",
    "sacch and facch are included on the data base station s side since they carry the essential signaling during data transmission and the combination of tch+facch+sacch is commonly used .",
    "note that the data base station has sdcch as well as the signaling base station .",
    "sdcch is essentially a standalone logical channel and not tied to tch , but it is used in the sdcch+sacch combination to provide large sdcch capacity when the load is heavy .",
    "this consideration leads us to leave sdcch also in the data base station .",
    ".functionality separation of gsm air interface [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we implement the proposed signaling splitting scheme of hyper - cellular network concept on the software defined radio platform openbts . in the openbts application physical layer ( l1 ) and data link layer ( l2 , lapdm ) are consistent with the standard gsm um interface specification , but the network layer ( l3 ) differs in several aspects : radio resource ( rr ) is terminated locally in openbts ; mobility management ( mm ) and call control ( cc ) are translated to sip transactions and handed to external pbx  @xcite .",
    "besides , openbts uses sqlite3 databases to store user information . a separate application named sipauthserve uses the databases to authenticate mobile users .",
    "this way traditional core network equipment is avoided , leading to a flattened and lightweight network infrastructure .    based on the source code of the openbts application we create the two types of base stations in hyper - cellular network .",
    "the separation of network functionality and gsm logical channels is applied to implement the signaling splitting scheme .",
    "after the separation only the signaling base station is capable of broadcasting system information , discovering and authenticating mobile users .",
    "the data base station keeps silent until receiving the appointment from the signaling base station",
    ". then it will take care of the mobile user s data transmission .",
    "the signaling message between the signaling base station and the data base station is exchanged by udp sockets in current implementation .",
    "figure  [ fig : exp ] depicts our experiment scenario . in the setup ,",
    "two openbts instances run on two dell commodity desktop pcs .",
    "the one with intel core i7 - 2600 cpu serves as the signaling base station and the other with intel core2 duo e6550 cpu runs the affiliated data base station instance .",
    "the two base stations use the same cell color code but different arfcns .",
    "usrp n210s from ettus research  @xcite are used as the radio front end .",
    "n210 is connected to the host pc by the gigabit ethernet interface .",
    "the on board oscillator runs at the frequency 100  mhz , with the frequency stability of 2.5  ppm .",
    "it can work fine with openbts s transceiver with resampling enabled at the host pc .",
    "we use wbx daughter boards which can operate in the 900  mhz band .",
    "the antennas are of the type vert900 .",
    "the two pcs and the master n210 are connected to one gigabit ethernet switch .",
    "two n210s are interconnected in shared ethernet mode with one mimo cable which synchronizes the clock and timing between them and enables data transmission between the slave n210 and the host pc .",
    "note that the asterisk instance and the sipauthserve instance are running only on the signaling base station side .",
    "they are in charge of switching and authentication respectively .",
    "we use two nokia 1000 gsm phones in the experiments .    in the tests we monitor the base stations activities when mobile users camp on the network and make phone calls to each other .",
    "the experiment results show that standard gsm handsets can camp on the network after powered on .",
    "the signaling information is exchanged between the mobile handset and the signaling base station , while the data base station does nothing but waits for the task appointment .",
    "phone calls can be connected between standard handsets .",
    "the channel request and paging are between the handset and the signaling base station .",
    "the channel appointment and response are done between the two types of base stations .",
    "direct connection is then established between the data base station and the mobile user for the connected phone call .",
    "the results validate our signaling splitting scheme of gsm air interface . to our knowledge",
