    "suppose alice wishes to send a ( classical ) message to bob , using a quantum system as the communication channel .",
    "alice prepares the system in the `` signal state '' @xmath0 with probability @xmath1 , so that the ensemble of states is described by an average density operator @xmath2 .",
    "bob makes a measurement of a `` decoding observable '' on the system and uses the result to infer which signal state was prepared .",
    "the choice of system preparation ( represented by the index @xmath3 ) and bob s measurement outcome are the input and output of a classical communication channel .",
    "holevo @xcite proved ( as gordon @xcite and levitin @xcite had previously conjectured ) that the mutual information between the input and output of this channel , regardless of bob s choice of decoding observable , can never be greater than @xmath4 , where @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the von neumann entropy of the density operator @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , it has been shown by holevo @xcite and by schumacher and westmoreland @xcite that the holevo bound is asymptotically achievable .",
    "that is , if alice uses many copies of the same channel , preparing long code words of signal states , and if bob chooses an entangled decoding observable , alice can convey to bob up to @xmath4 bits of information per use of the channel , with arbitrarily low probability of error .",
    "( this fact was first shown for pure state signals in @xcite . )",
    "suppose the channel is a noisy one described by a superoperator @xmath8 .",
    "then if alice prepares the input signal state @xmath0 , bob will receive the output signal state @xmath9 .",
    "it is the ensemble of output signal states that determines the capacity of the channel .",
    "effectively , the superoperator @xmath8 restricts the set of signals that alice can present to bob for decoding .",
    "if @xmath10 is the set of all density operators , then alice s efforts can only produce output states in the set @xmath11 .",
    "in this paper we will consider the problem of maximizing @xmath4 for ensembles of states drawn from a given set @xmath12 of available states .",
    "this includes the problem of maximizing @xmath4 for the outputs of a noisy channel , if @xmath12 is chosen to be the set of possible channel outputs . in this case",
    ", @xmath12 will be a convex set ; but we will not need the convexity of @xmath12 for many of our results .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath13 are density operators , then the _ relative entropy _ of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath13 is defined to be @xmath14 here are three important points about the relative entropy :    * @xmath15 , with equality if and only if @xmath16 . * strictly speaking , @xmath17 is defined only if @xmath18 ( where `` @xmath19 '' is the support of the operator @xmath7 ) .",
    "if this is not the case , then we take @xmath20 . for example , if @xmath7 and @xmath13 are distinct pure states , the relative entropy is always infinite . *",
    "the relative entropy is jointly convex in its arguments : @xmath21 for @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "from this fact it also follows that the relative entropy is convex in each of its arguments .    the relative entropy plays a role in the asymptotic distinguishability of quantum states by measurement @xcite , and has been used to develop measures of quantum entanglement @xcite    it is often convenient to think of the relative entropy @xmath17 as a `` directed distance '' from @xmath13 to @xmath7 , even though it lacks some of the properties of a true metric .",
    "this view of the relative entropy will let us give a geometric interpretation to our results .",
    "suppose as before we have an ensemble of signal states in the available set @xmath12 , in which @xmath0 appears with probability @xmath1 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the holevo bound @xmath4 can be given in terms of the relative entropy : @xmath24 that is , @xmath4 is just the average of the relative entropy of the members of the signal ensemble with respect to the average signal state .",
    "to maximize the information capacity of the channel , alice will want to choose a signal ensemble that maximizes @xmath4 .",
    "we will denote the maximum of @xmath4 for a given set @xmath12 of available states by @xmath25 .",
    "any ensemble of signal states that achieves this value of the holevo bound will be called an _ optimal _ signal ensemble .",
    "if the set of available states @xmath12 is a closed convex set , then we can always take an optimal ensemble to be composed of extreme points of @xmath12that is , states which can not be written as convex sums of other states in @xmath12 . to see this ,",
    "suppose we have an ensemble of @xmath12-states with average state @xmath7 , and further suppose that @xmath26 is a member of the ensemble that is not an extreme point .",
    "this means that there are states @xmath27 and @xmath28 in @xmath12 such that @xmath29 for probabilities @xmath30 and @xmath31 that sum to unity . by the convexity of the relative entropy , @xmath32 since @xmath4 is the average of the relative entropies , we will never make @xmath4 smaller by replacing @xmath26 ( with probability @xmath33 ) by @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( with probabilities @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ) in the ensemble .",
    "thus , at least one optimal ensemble will be composed of extreme points of @xmath12 .    for noisy channels ,",
    "this means that pure state inputs to the channel are optimal  that is , it never increases @xmath4 to use mixed states as inputs .",
    "this fact was shown in @xcite .",
    "a second and very surprising fact was discovered by fuchs @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is a measure of the distinguishability of an ensemble of signal states .",
    "if we wish to maximize the distinguishability of the output signals of a noisy channel , we might imagine that we should always maximize the distinguishability of the input signals  i.e . , choose an orthogonal set of input states . but",
    "this intuition turns out to be false .",
    "some insight can be gained by examining a specific counter - example .",
    "our quantum system is a spin , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent eigenstates of @xmath38 .",
    "the spin is subject to `` amplitude damping '' , so that an initial density operator @xmath7 evolves into a density operator @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the result of this operation is , for instance , to leave the state @xmath37 unchanged but to cause @xmath36 to decay to @xmath37 with probability @xmath43 .",
    "we choose @xmath44 .",
    "a diagram of this process in the bloch sphere is found in figure  [ fuchs ] .",
    "if we consider only orthogonal input signal ensembles , the maximum @xmath4 is obtained for an equally weighted ensemble of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , for which @xmath47 bits . but a non - orthogonal ensemble of the states @xmath48 and @xmath49 can achieve @xmath50 bits , where the angle in hilbert space between the two inputs is about 80@xmath51 .",
    "why is this ?",
    "recall that @xmath4 is the average relative entropy `` distance '' from the average signal state to the individual signal states .",
    "this distance function grows larger near the boundary of the bloch sphere ",
    "so that , for example , the relative entropy distance between distinct pure states is infinite .",
    "thus , despite the appearance in figure  [ fuchs ] , the relative entropy distances for the ensemble of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are _ greater _ than those for the ensemble of @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in this section we will prove some useful results that will enable us to further characterize the optimal ensembles for a given set @xmath12 of available states .",
    "suppose as before that the signal state @xmath56 appears in our ensemble with probability @xmath33 , yielding an average state @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath13 be some other density operator , which we will call the `` alternate '' state .",
    "then we can calculate the average relative entropy distance of the signal states from @xmath13 : @xmath57 this useful identity , first given by donald@xcite , has a number of implications .",
    "for example ,    * for any ensemble and any @xmath13 , @xmath58 with equality if and only if @xmath59 .",
    "* from the previous point it follows that @xmath60 where the minimum is taken over all density operators @xmath13 .",
    "now we will use our identity to consider how the value of @xmath4 would change if we were to modify our ensemble .",
    "in particular , we can introduce a new state @xmath52 with probability @xmath61 , shrinking the other probabilities to maintain normalization .",
    "we may conveniently refer to our ensembles as the `` original '' and `` modified '' ensembles , as summarized in the following table :    [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     where @xmath62 we wish to find how the holevo bound changes  that is , we wish to make an estimate of @xmath63 .",
    "begin with the expression for @xmath64 and apply equation  [ coverish ] , choosing the original ensemble and letting the modified average state @xmath65 play the role of the alternate state .",
    "this yields @xmath66 therefore , @xmath67 this gives us a lower bound for @xmath68 .    to obtain an upper bound , we apply equation  [ coverish ] to the modified ensemble , with the original average state @xmath7 playing the role of the alternate state .",
    "@xmath69 and so we obtain @xmath70 in deriving this inequality , we obviously assume that @xmath71 .",
    "but if this is not the case , then the inequality still holds in the sense that the right - hand side is infinite .",
    "it is easy to generalize these results to a situation in which we modify the ensemble by adding many states .",
    "suppose the states @xmath72 are added with probabilities @xmath73 ( where the @xmath74 s form a probability distribution ) .",
    "then the above results would become @xmath75 all of our subsequent results still hold in this more general situation , but to simplify the discussion we will phrase our arguments in terms of `` single state '' modifications of a given ensemble .    finally , consider states @xmath76 and @xmath7 , and let @xmath77 . then @xmath78 exists and is finite for @xmath79 , and    * if @xmath71 , then @xmath80 as @xmath81 . * otherwise , @xmath82 as @xmath81 .",
    "we see that equations [ lower ] and [ upper ] are fairly `` tight '' lower and upper bounds for @xmath68 , because ( informally speaking ) the two expressions approach one another as @xmath61 approaches zero .",
    "for a given set @xmath83 of available states ( e.g. , the outputs of a noisy channel ) , let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the members and probabilities of the ensemble of @xmath83-states for which @xmath4 takes on its maximum value .",
    "call this the `` @xmath4-optimal ensemble '' , and let @xmath84 be the average state of this ensemble .",
    "denote @xmath85 by @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath4-optimal ensemble has a number of important properties .",
    ": :    if the letter states are outputs of a noisy channel in a    finite - dimensional hilbert space , then a @xmath4-maximizing    ensemble exists .",
    "+    * proof : * the key result can found in @xcite : let    @xmath12 be a convex , compact subset    @xmath12 of density operators on a hilbert    space of finite dimension @xmath87 , and let @xmath7    be in @xmath12 . if the set of extremal elements    of @xmath88 is compact then for any @xmath89    there exists an ensemble of states    @xmath90 with    @xmath91 that maximizes @xmath4    over the set of all ensembles whose average state is    @xmath7 . in other words , there exist optimal signal    ensembles for a given average state @xmath7 . by    caratheodory s theorem ,",
    "since the hilbert space has @xmath87    dimensions , then there are optimal ensembles ( in this sense ) with no    more than @xmath92 states .",
    "+    we see that the conditions for the result from @xcite are met .",
    "the    set of states @xmath12 that are possible    outputs of the channel is a convex , compact set with a compact set of    extremal points . for any average state @xmath7 in    @xmath12",
    ", we can find a    @xmath7-fixed optimal ensemble with @xmath92 or    fewer elements .",
    "thus , in order to maximize @xmath4 over all    possible ensembles , we only need to consider the set of ensembles with    no more than @xmath92 elements drawn from    @xmath12 .",
    "as this is a finite cartesian product    of a compact set , it is compact . as @xmath4 is a continuous    function",
    ", it must achieve its maximum in this set of ensembles .",
    "thus ,    the existence of an optimal ensemble of states in    @xmath12 is assured .",
    "maximal distance property . : :    for any state @xmath76 in @xmath83 ,    @xmath93    +    * proof .",
    "* we assume the existence of a state @xmath76 with    @xmath94 .",

    "then by equation  [ lower ] , @xmath98 that is , we can increase @xmath4    by including @xmath76 in the signal ensemble , which is a    contradiction .",

    ".    +    * proof .",
    "* this is a corollary to the maximum distance property .",
    "if    there were a state @xmath103 so that    @xmath104 were not contained in    @xmath105 , then    @xmath95 would    be infinite .",
    "sufficiency of maximal distance property .",

    ". then this must be a    @xmath4-optimal ensemble .",
    "that is , the only ensembles that    have the maximal distance property are @xmath4-optimal    ensembles .",
    "+    * proof : * if we add a state @xmath76 with probability    @xmath61 to the ensemble , then from equation  [ upper ]    @xmath108 so that we can not increase    @xmath4 .",
    "( by equation  [ manystate ] , the same would hold if    we were to add several different states instead of only one . )",

    "equal distance property .",
    ": :    suppose @xmath0 is a member of a    @xmath4-optimal ensemble with probability    @xmath110 .",

    "+    * proof : * this is another corollary to the maximal distance property .    if    @xmath112    for any @xmath0 with @xmath110 , then the    average relative entropy can not equal @xmath86 .",
    "min - max formula for @xmath86 .",
    ": :    from the above properties , we can show the following formula :    @xmath113 where the maximum is taken over all    @xmath103 and the minimum is taken over all    average states @xmath7 of ensembles of    @xmath83-states .",
    "+    * proof : * we first show that , for any state @xmath13 , the    quantity    @xmath114    is an upper bound for the value of @xmath4 for any possible    ensemble . by equation  [ donaldcorollary ] , we find that    @xmath115    this will also hold for an optimal signal ensemble , for which    @xmath109 .",
