    "in his seminal work , `` a spiral nebula as a stellar system , messier 33 , '' @xcite presented the discovery of 35 cepheid variables in that galaxy , which were used to determine its distance .",
    "no other searches for variables in m33 were undertaken for the next fifty years , until the surveys of @xcite that discovered a total of 77 new cepheids and recovered many of hubble s objects .",
    "the direct project @xcite started in 1996 the first modern ccd - based search for variables in m33 , among other targets .",
    "our first two seasons surveyed three @xmath4 fields located in the central area of m33 ; the variable star content of these fields has been presented in @xcite and @xcite . since these fields had been covered by all previous surveys , we cross - correlated our variable star catalog with published catalogs and successfully identified 57 of the 60 known cepheids .",
    "two of the three missing variables were short period cepheids : b08 from @xcite ( p=3.2  d ) and q19113 from @xcite ( p=13.4  d ) .",
    "these variables are faint and close to our detection threshold ; therefore , it was not surprising that they eluded our detection .",
    "the third missing variable turned out to be a surprising object , and is the topic of this paper .",
    "it is v19 from @xcite , classified by him as a 54.7-day cepheid .",
    "it is a bright , isolated , and easy to identify star located some @xmath5 north of the nucleus .",
    "hubble s light curve exhibited a variation of @xmath6  mag , which is not present in our data .",
    "additionally , the mean @xmath0 magnitude of the object increased by @xmath7  mag since hubble s original observations .    ",
    "2 summarizes the existing photometry for this object ;  3 addresses the current variability , periodicity , and location of this object in the h - r and pl diagrams ; and  4 discusses the possible nature of this object and its known galactic counterparts .",
    "the discovery of v19 by @xcite was based on observations obtained at the mount wilson 100-inch telescope in 56 epochs between august 1919 and september 1925 , with two additional plates from september 1909 and august 1910 .",
    "magnitudes were measured using the argelander method , and were based on local reference stars calibrated through a photometric sequence from the selected area 45 .",
    "hubble s original magnitudes suffered from zeropoint and scale errors , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we calculated a new transformation between hubble s magnitude scale and the standard system , using our photometry @xcite for hubble s original comparison stars .",
    "we identified 121 of these stars in our ccd images , using the finding charts published by @xcite and performed a least - squares fit between hubble s photographic magnitudes and our ccd - based @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "we found    -12pt @xmath8 + 19.68(\\pm0.02),\\ ] ]    where @xmath9 is the @xmath0 magnitude in the standard system and @xmath10 is the photographic magnitude as measured by hubble .",
    "the relation has a scatter of 0.18  mag after the rejection of 11 stars which deviated by more than 0.5  mag .",
    "our coefficients agree with those derived by @xcite .",
    "we corrected hubble s original measurements using the newly derived transformation , and analyzed the data using a suite of programs developed by the direct project @xcite .",
    "we derived a best - fit period of 54.71 days , identical to hubble s original value , and an intensity - weighted mean @xmath0 magnitude of @xmath1  mag .",
    "figure 1 shows a phased light curve of v19 based on hubble s recalibrated data .",
    "the scatter in the light curve is consistent with the _ r.m.s . _",
    "scatter of equation 1 .",
    "we based our identification of v19 on the finding charts of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , all of whom mark the same star as the variable .",
    "v19 is the direct object d33j013357.1 + 304512.4 , located at r.a.=1h33m57.1s , dec.=+30d45m12.4s ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "we ruled out a mis - identification of v19 with a nearby star in hubble s original finding chart by identifying all variables in the general vicinity ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this is a generous search area , given the fact that all other variables discovered by hubble were recovered within a few arcseconds of previously published positions .",
    "the nearest variable of any kind is d33j013357.1 + 304455.2 , a faint ( @xmath12 ) periodic variable located @xmath13 south of v19 .",
    "the nearest cepheid is d33j013354.9 + 304532.5 , with a period of 36 days and located @xmath14 north - west of v19 .",
    "the nearest cepheid with a period close to hubble s original period for v19 is d33j013347.5 + 304423.2 , with a period of 56 days and located @xmath15 to the south - west .",
    "v19 was observed by the direct project a total of 11 , 116 and 60 times in @xmath16 , respectively , during the 1996 and 1997 observing seasons .",
    "the description of the reduction and analysis of this data set was presented in @xcite .",
    "additional observations of another direct field which contains v19 were obtained during the 1999 season ; for the purposes of this paper , we performed a preliminary reduction using the standard direct pipeline @xcite and calibrated the resulting photometry using bright , non - variable stars from the database of @xcite .",
    "this third year of observations yielded an additional 19 , 121 and 35 points in @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the mean @xmath16 magnitudes of v19 obtained from the three seasons spanned by our data are @xmath2 , @xmath17 and @xmath18  mag , respectively .",
    "the light curves exhibit very little variation , of order 0.05  mag peak - to - peak .",
    " 3 contains the analysis of our light curve data .",
    "we searched the literature for additional observations of v19 obtained after 1926 and before 1996 .",
    "the only time series photometry that we were able to locate was that of @xcite , who obtained 67 plates of m33 between january 1966 and november 1974 at the palomar 48-inch schmidt , using a variety of plate types and filters . the data for v19 consists of 19 points in @xmath0 and 41 points in @xmath19 .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties quoted by the authors for the individual measurements is 0.7  mag , and there are no data available to check the absolute calibration of their photometric systems .    v19 was observed by @xcite in their survey for blue and red stars in m33 , and was designated as r142 in their catalog .",
    "we corrected their tabulated photometry according to @xcite and obtained @xmath20  mag and @xmath21  mag , consistent with our own determinations .",
    "unfortunately , the authors did not obtain a spectrum for this star .",
    "additionally , v19 is present in the fields surveyed by @xcite , but these authors do not list it in their compilation of variables .",
    "@xcite reported the results of @xmath22 observations of v19 and other m33 cepheids conducted between 1980 and 1983 at a variety of telescopes using a photometer with a @xmath23 diameter aperture .",
    "however , the authors expressed concerns about possible contamination by field stars inside their aperture .",
    "therefore , we analyzed @xmath24-band images of v19 , obtained by don mccarthy with the pisces camera @xcite at the refurbished mmt , under @xmath25 seeing .",
    "these images show the presence of another star of similar infrared flux some @xmath26 away . a preliminary calibration of the mmt data , based on isolated 2mass stars present in the field of view , yields a mean magnitude for v19 of @xmath27  mag .",
    "this , in turn , implies a @xmath28 color of @xmath29  mag , which is somewhat redder than , but consistent with , the one predicted for a 55-day cepheid , @xmath30  mag ( c.f .",
    "equations 5 and 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "lastly , we retrieved archival hst / wfpc2 frames in which v19 is present ( dataset u2c604 , proposal # 0538 ) from the space telescope archive .",
    "the images were obtained in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 filters and show the object ( at x=92,y=283 on wf4 ) to be well isolated , with no detectable companions inside our ground - based seeing disk .",
    "we computed the @xmath33 index @xcite using all 237 @xmath19 measurements from the direct data , and found a value of @xmath34 , which is above the standard direct threshold of 0.75 .",
    "however , the overall _ r.m.s .",
    "_ scatter is only 0.025  mag , below our usual threshold of 0.04  mag .",
    "therefore , the star does not meet the standard criteria for variability adopted by the direct project .",
    "we attempted to find a period from our data , using the standard direct technique of a modified lafler - kinman algorithm @xcite and the clean algorithm of @xcite .",
    "no convincing periods were found , which is not surprising given that our frame - to - frame random photometric error ( arising from the limitations of fixed - position psf photometry ) is of the order of @xmath35  mag .",
    "we conclude that _ if _ the 54.7-day periodicity seen by hubble is still present , its amplitude must be less than 0.05  mag .",
    "long - term follow - up observations using larger telescopes would be most useful to detect any small - scale periodicity and/or variability .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0-band light curve of v19 from 1910 to 2000 , based on the data from @xcite , vhk75 , and this work .",
    "the intensity - weighted mean magnitude shows a dramatic increase , from @xmath1  mag in 1919 - 1925 to @xmath36 in 1996 - 1999 , while the amplitude of pulsation decreases from 1.1  mag to undetectable levels .",
    "figure 3 shows the location of v19 in the h - r diagrams of @xcite .",
    "we also plot the location of 130 cepheids with @xmath37  days present in the inner region of m33 @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the location of v19 in the @xmath16 cepheid p - l relations defined by the same set of variables , using hubble s original period of 54.7 days .",
    "these figures indicate that the modern optical magnitudes of v19 are somewhat brighter than , but still consistent with , those of 55-day cepheids in m33 .",
    "the cessation of pulsations , or any significant decrease in amplitude ( i.e. , by a factor of ten ) , has never been observed in a classical cepheid .",
    "v19 may be the first case , or it may belong to another class of variable stars .",
    "we present here four classes of variable stars whose pulsational behaviour may explain the nature of v19",
    ".    _ population ii cepheids _ : ru cam , a 22-day cepheid which in 1965 abruptly decreased in amplitude from 1  mag to about 0.1 - 0.2  mag @xcite , was later shown to be a w virginis variable ( population ii cepheid ) that exhibited a highly unstable and modulated light curve thereafter @xcite . even before the 1965 event , @xcite had suggested that ru cam may be a w virginis variable .",
    "however , ru cam is of little relevance to our case , because in order for v19 to be a population ii cepheid , it should be about 2 magnitudes fainter ( see * ? ? ? * ) than population i cepheids of similar period .",
    "furthermore , w virginis variables are not known to change their mean magnitude , although a few rv tauri variables ( longer - period population ii cepheids ) do that cyclically .",
    "_ peculiar population i cepheids _ : these objects are extremely rare and entirely confined to much shorter periods . a case in point",
    "is the classical cepheid v473 lyr of @xmath38 days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has an amplitude modulation of a factor of 15 which resembles the beating of two closely spaced pulsation modes .",
    "this phenomenon is not understood , but it is most likely associated with the interaction of high - order modes .",
    "furthermore , the interval corresponding to low amplitudes in v473 lyr has a short duration ; in general , the phenomenon seems to have very little in common with v19 .",
    "a more relevant object in this category could be polaris , now established to be a population i cepheid pulsating in the first overtone mode @xcite .",
    "it has a period is 3.97 days , and its amplitude has decreased by a factor of 3 over the past 50 years . despite earlier reports , this amplitude decrease has stabilized over the past 15 years ; the pulsation amplitude is practically constant since 1986 @xcite . as in the case of v473 lyr",
    ", the amplitude decrease could be due to high - order mode interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the pulsation amplitude of polaris has always been very low ( @xmath39  mag in v ) , which makes the comparison with v19 difficult .",
    "finally , we should note that there are stars inside the cepheid instability strip that are not variable , for reasons that are still unknown .    _",
    "uu herculis stars _ : these are supergiants with cepheid - like pulsations that exhibit occasional standstills @xcite .",
    "pulsations cease abruptly and at mid - cycle ( corresponding to the mean magnitude of the star ) , last a couple of months , and then abruptly start again @xcite .",
    "the uu herculis stars may alternate between cepheid - like and rv tauri - like pulsations ( over timescales of several years ) with periods of 30 to 90 days , which are always of relatively low amplitude ( @xmath400.3  mag in v ) .",
    "uu her is the only exception , with amplitudes as high as 0.6  mag in v. most stars in this class have infrared excesses , low metallicities , and show variable emission in the h@xmath41 line @xcite .    _ luminous blue variables _ : given its luminosity ( m@xmath42  mag ) , v19 appears to be more closely related to the luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) , which are not always blue .",
    "one example is 164 g sco ( m@xmath43 , t=10,000k , @xmath44 , after * ? ? ?",
    "it shows multiperiodic variability ( @xmath45 days ) of very low amplitude ( @xmath39  mag in v ) .",
    "occasionally , lbvs experience dramatic outbursts and mass loss episodes which could considerably alter their effective radii and temperatures for extended periods of time .",
    "there also exist other luminous supergiants which are not lbvs but exhibit cepheid - like pulsations , such as v810 cen @xcite .",
    "however , their pulsations have always been observed to be low ( @xmath39  mag ) and multiperiodic .",
    "each of the types described above belongs to a different evolutionary state .",
    "the w virginis ( and rv tauri ) variables are most likely low - mass agb ( and tip - of- or post - agb ) stars ( hydrogen- and helium - shell burning ) . the same appears to be true for the majority of uu hers stars ( a related object which `` wanders '' across the hr diagram is fg sge ) . hence their lower luminosity and common circumstellar infrared excesses .",
    "they often show emission in the absorption profile of the h@xmath41 and other strong lines .",
    "there is no evidence that v19 possesses any of the above characteristics and its luminosity is incompatibly higher .",
    "the remaining types of variables ( lbvs , v810 cen ) are very massive supergiants . at a given pulsation period",
    "they are brighter than population i cepheids and they are unlikely to be mistaken for cepheids , due to their low amplitudes and multi - periodic pulsation .    in summary",
    ", v19 does not belong to any of the above types : it is too luminous to be a low - mass population ii star , and its pulsation was too regular and high - amplitude 75 years ago to be a massive microvariable supergiant .",
    "therefore , v19 appears to be a high - mass population i star that behaves more like a low - mass population ii rv tauri variable .",
    "given the bright and isolated nature of v19 , and its location in the host galaxy , it is likely that most photographic plates of m33 obtained at 2-m class ( or larger ) telescopes during the 20th century will yield precise photometry for this object .",
    "we encourage the astronomical community to contact us if they are in possession of plate material that might help constrain the past behavior of v19 .",
    "future observations , including spectroscopy and long - term , multi - band photometric follow - up , will help resolve the nature of this object .",
    "such resolution is desirable in order to avoid misclassifying objects like v19 as classical cepheids in distant galaxies .",
    "we would like to thank don mccarthy for the pisces images of v19 taken at the new mmt .",
    "thanks are due to d. bersier , n.r .",
