    "<S> the lowest - known excited state in nuclei is the 7.6 ev isomer of @xmath0th . </S>",
    "<S> this energy is within the range of laser - based investigations that could allow accurate measurements of possible temporal variation of this energy splitting . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn could probe temporal variation of the fine - structure constant or other parameters in the nuclear hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the sensitivity of this transition energy to these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two states are predicted to have identical deformations and thus the same coulomb energies within the accuracy of the model ( viz . </S>",
    "<S> , within roughly 30 kev ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find no enhanced sensitivity to variation of the fine - structure constant . in the case of the strong interaction the energy splitting </S>",
    "<S> is found to have a complicated dependence on several parameters of the interaction , which makes an accurate prediction of sensitivity to temporal changes of fundamental constants problematical . </S>",
    "<S> neither the strong- nor coulomb - interaction contributions to the energy splitting of this doublet can be constrained within an accuracy better than a few tens of kev , so that only upper limits can be set on the possible sensitivity to temporal variations of the fundamental constants .    </S>",
    "<S> the isotope @xmath0th has recently become of interest because of its unusually low - lying ( 7.6 ev , 3/2@xmath1 ) @xcite first excited state , which is an isomeric state with an estimated half - life of 5 hours . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 ground - state - to - isomer transition energy is within the range of atomic transitions , and it has been suggested that this almost degenerate doublet in @xmath0th could be used as a nuclear clock @xcite and as a sensitive probe of possible temporal variation of fundamental constants , including the fine - structure constant ( @xmath3 ) and the quark mass@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of the transition energy to temporal changes in the fundamental constants varies considerably depending on the assumptions made@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite temporal variation of the fine structure constant ( @xmath4 ) was related to constants in the nilsson hamiltonian , whereas in @xcite @xmath4 was shown to be proportional to the coulomb energy difference between the two states , which requires detailed information about the deformations involved . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is important to understand the nuclear - structure issues giving rise to this doublet .    in the present work we examined this doublet using the finite - range microscopic - macroscopic model ( frdm)@xcite , which describes many nuclear - structure properties ( such as ground - state masses and deformations ) over a broad range of nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to examine the sensitivity of the energy splitting between these states to the underlying components of the effective nuclear interaction , including the single - particle potential and the pairing , spin - orbit , and coulomb interactions . </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of this sensitivity is essential for determining the sensitivity of the transition energy to possible temporal variation of fundamental constants .    in our macroscopic - microscopic model@xcite </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic terms give the smooth variation of the nuclear potential energy ( mass ) with proton number @xmath5 , neutron number @xmath6 , and deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of nuclear structure properties on microscopic quantum - mechanical effects is obtained from a deformed single - particle potential through the use of strutinsky s method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nine constants of the macroscopic part have been determined in a least - squares adjustment to 1654 measured nuclear masses with @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; the details are given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for these 1654 nuclei ranging from @xmath9o to @xmath10106 the model mass accuracy is 0.669 mev . for the heavier mass regions the model is more accurate : for n@xmath1165 the corresponding accuracy is 0.448 mev . </S>",
    "<S> values of other model constants ( such as the depth and diffuseness of the single - particle potential , and the strengths of the spin - orbit and pairing interactions ) are determined from other global considerations , as discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ground - state masses and shapes have been calculated for 8979 nuclei and tabulated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the shape parameters tabulated are quadrupole ( @xmath12 ) , octupole ( @xmath13 ) , hexadecapole ( @xmath14 ) , and hexacontatetrapole ( @xmath15 ) deformation ( shape ) degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> strong evidence of reliability of the model is given by its now well - established predictive capabilities for new nuclear - mass regions , including unstable nuclei and super - heavy nuclei .    in the present calculations we carried out a high - accuracy determination of the ground - state deformation and quasi - particle energy by minimizing the potential energy for @xmath0th on a fine deformation grid . taking advantage of enhanced present - day computational power , we varied all four shape parameters in steps of 0.001 , which is to be compared to the 0.05 grid step used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we predict three very closely lying states with identical deformation : the @xmath16 ground state , the @xmath17 isomer , and a @xmath18 state . </S>",
    "<S> the three lowest ( almost degenerate ) neutron quasi - particle states are predicted to have deformations : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 state , with asymptotic quantum numbers @xmath23 = [ 732 , 5/2 ^ -]$ ] , lies lowest in energy . </S>",
    "<S> the ground - state and isomer doublet of interest have asymptotic quantum numbers @xmath24 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] , respectively , and are predicted to lie at 13.6 kev and 21.6 kev above the @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the three lowest neutron quasi - particle configurations are predicted to have the same deformation ( which determines their proton distribution ) , they also have the same coulomb energy ( within the model uncertainties ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for other states in @xmath0th , for which the energy was found to be minimized by different values of the shape parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> although minor changes to the model parameters could move this triplet of states relative to one another , the exact position of the 5/2@xmath26 state is not essential to our present interest , since the predicted energy of that state does not directly affect the sensitivity of the splitting between the 5/2@xmath27 doublet to the underlying interaction . given the global accuracy of the model in this mass region , we expect that the 5/2@xmath26 state should lie somewhere within 50 kev of the ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated positions of the three lowest - lying states as functions of deformation are shown in fig .  1 , and </S>",
    "<S> the three states are seen to track very closely in energy for values of @xmath12 between roughly 0.12 and 0.22 . as discussed below </S>",
    "<S> , we find a similar close tracking for all of the deformation parameters : @xmath28 . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also show in fig .  2 the @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] doublet together with two other low - lying states of @xmath0th . </S>",
    "<S> note the very different energy scales used in figs .  1 and 2 , and that the latter two states do not show a minimum at the same deformation as the three lowest states , which is the more typical situation seen in deformed nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of different quasi - particle configurations for a nucleus are not generally minimized by the same values of deformation parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the predicted energy separation of the @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] doublet ( viz . , 8.3 kev ) is large compared to the actual excitation energy of the isomer ( 7.6 ev ) , but it nonetheless means that on a `` normal '' nuclear - energy scale the two states are predicted to be almost degenerate . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> typical quasi - single - particle energy splittings in this mass region are a few hundred kev . </S>",
    "<S> for completeness we note that the odd - neutron wave function for the @xmath30 isomer is calculated to have the following asymptotic nilsson components :    @xmath31 + 0.519[642 ] + 0.431[613]\\nonumber \\\\ -0.221[622 ]   -0.137[602 ] -0.131[853 ] \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while that of the @xmath32 ground state has components : @xmath33 -0.123[871 ] -0.104[622 ] \\ , .   </S>",
    "<S> \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] those components in the wave functions whose squared amplitudes are less than 1% are not listed .    </S>",
    "<S> when quasi - particle configurations have the same deformation , the energy difference between them is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fermi energy , @xmath36 is the pairing gap obtained by solving the pairing equations , and @xmath37 are the single - particle energies for the two states ; all of these energies depend on deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the near degeneracy between the ground state and isomer of @xmath0th arises because the fermi surface energy is about midway between @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the isomer and the ground state will be exactly degenerate when @xmath40 ( i.e. , for @xmath41 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle energies @xmath42 depend on the deformed single - particle potential well and on the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> these in turn depend on parameters governing the depth and diffuseness of the potential well and the strength parameter of the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> although the single - particle energies depend on the shape of the potential , the shape parameters are not in the category of adjustable parameters , and single - particle energies are calculated by minimizing the energy of the chosen configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the doublet splitting on the fine - structure constant is particularly straightforward to examine in our model , as we discuss below . on the other hand , expressing that splitting in terms of more fundamental parameters of the strong interaction ( such as the quark mass , for example ) would require a very detailed and non - trivial analysis of the relation between the model parameters and fundamental sub - nucleon degrees of freedom@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is therefore necessarily restricted to a study of the sensitivity of the predicted doublet splitting to the effective interactions in our model .     calculated quasi - particle energies for the three lowest quasiparticle states ( relative to the @xmath43 $ ] ground state , which therefore has zero energy for all deformations ) in @xmath0th as functions of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> all three states remain almost degenerate at all values of @xmath12 near the common minimum at @xmath44     calculated quasi - particle energies of the 3/2@xmath1 - 5/2@xmath1 doublet and of a @xmath45 state and a @xmath46 state in @xmath0th as functions of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the doublet states remain almost degenerate for a wide range of values of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> note the change in energy scale from fig  1 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the similarity in the shape of the ground and isomeric states of @xmath0th implies that ( within the accuracy of the model ) they have the same charge ( i.e. , proton ) distribution and therefore the same coulomb energy . </S>",
    "<S> this has unfortunate implications with respect to experimental searches for a temporal variation in the fine - structure constant ( @xmath4 ) obtained from measuring a temporal variation in the energy splitting between these two states ( denoted by @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter variation is proportional to the coulomb - energy difference of the two states @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore find essentially no sensitivity to @xmath4 , since @xmath50 for our chosen mesh - parameter step size . </S>",
    "<S> allowing @xmath12 to vary by the mesh - parameter step size ( 0.001 ) in this calculation produces a variation in @xmath51 of approximately 30 kev , and this sets the upper limit for variations in @xmath47 relative to @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in the effective nuclear interaction prevent any nuclear - structure calculation from being predictive on an ev scale .    </S>",
    "<S> [ vary ]     best & @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 + & & & & + 8.8 kev & -4.4kev , 31.6 kev & 25.4 kev , 2.0 kev & -44.2 kev , 29 kev & 8.7 kev , 9.2 kev + & & & & +    with the exception of accidental degeneracies , nearly degenerate doublets in deformed nuclei reflect a strong similarity in the deformation of the states involved . if the deformations of two states are not similar their energy splittings are typically * at least * several tens of kev . to illustrate this and to investigate the accuracy of the model for very close - lying ( ev ) doublets we examined the ground and isomeric states in @xmath57u , where the observed energy splitting is 76 ev . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated this ( @xmath58 ) doublet , again allowing all of the deformation parameters to vary independently for each state . </S>",
    "<S> the results are very similar to those for @xmath0th , with the ground - state and isomer energies being minimized by the same values of the deformation parameters , and lying just below and above the fermi surface , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the deformations for these two states in @xmath57u were found to be @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the predicted energy splitting was 29 kev .    </S>",
    "<S> we next considered the sensitivity of the structure of the @xmath0th doublet to several of the globally determined strong - interaction parameters of the model , namely , the depth and diffuseness of the single - particle potential , and the strength of the pairing and spin - orbit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we varied each of these four global parameters by @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> we note , however , that variations of this magnitude would likely destroy the agreement with ground - state masses and for some nuclei would lead to incorrect assignments . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the strengths of the neutron and proton spin - orbit interactions have been fitted to experimental levels in the rare - earth and actinide regions , where properties of these nuclei ( particularly level spacings and orderings ) strongly suggest a linear dependence of the spin - orbit strength on the nuclear mass number @xmath64 : @xmath65 with this parameterization the constraints on @xmath66 are considerably tighter than 10% . nonetheless , in order to gain a better understanding of the origin of the near degeneracy in @xmath0th we varied the strength of this and the other three parameters by @xmath6710% . </S>",
    "<S> the results are summarized in table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted doublet splitting varies on the kev scale within a 10% variation of these four global parameters , while for some variations the levels are predicted to be inverted ( indicted by a minus sign in table i ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is no one parameter or part of the interaction determining or dominating the magnitude of the predicted splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy instead arises from a complicated combination of different effects causing the ground state and isomer to lie just below and above the fermi surface , respectively .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have examined the structure of the ground state and isomer in @xmath0th . within the present model the two states </S>",
    "<S> are predicted to be different quasi - single - particle neutron states , but corresponding to the same nuclear deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb energy is predicted to be the same for the two states ( within an uncertainty of roughly 30 kev induced by our mesh - step size ) , which suggests no enhanced sensitivity to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the near degeneracy appears to be accidental and is difficult to parameterize in terms of any one component of the effective interaction . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this doublet remains of interest in possible searches for time variations in fundamental physics because of the small energy splitting involved . </S>"
