    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have a prominent role in modern astrophysics and are the best standard candles for probing the universe on cosmological scales due to their high luminosities and remarkable uniformities ( e.g. , riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 )",
    ". however , the identity of their progenitors and the physics of their explosion mechanisms are still uncertain ( see hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2008 ; wang & han 2012 ; maoz et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "sne  ia are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon  oxygen white dwarfs ( co wds ) at about the chandrasekhar mass , though the means by which they grow to about the chandrasekhar mass still remain unclear ( see nomoto et al .",
    "two kinds of progenitor models have been proposed as possible mechanisms by which sne ia can be produced , which are the single - degenerate and double - degenerate models . in the single - degenerate model ,",
    "a co wd can accrete h- or he - rich matter from a non - degenerate star to increase its mass to approach the chandrasekhar mass , and then generate a thermonuclear explosion to become an sn ia , in which the donor star could be a main - sequence star , a subgiant , a red giant , or a he star ( e.g. , hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ; li & van den heuvel 1997 ; langer et al .  2000 ; han & podsiadlowski 2004 ; meng et al . 2009 ; wang et al .",
    "2009a ) . in the double - degenerate model ,",
    "sne ia arise from the merging of two co wds in a close binary .",
    "the closeness of two wds is due to common envelope evolution , which then enables gravitational wave radiation to drive orbital inspiral to merger ( e.g. , webbink 1984 ; iben & tutukov 1984 ) .",
    "some variants of these two models have been proposed to explain the observed diversity of sne ia ( for recent reviews see wang & han 2012 ; maoz et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "according to hydrodynamic simulations , denissenkov et al .",
    "( 2013 ) recently suggested that convective boundary mixing in an super - agb star can prevent the carbon burning from reaching the center , and will lead to the formation of a hybrid cone wd after the star has lost its envelope ; such a wd has an unburnt co - core surrounded by a thick one zone . following the work of denissenkov et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , chen et al .",
    "( 2014 ) found that , considering the uncertainty of the carbon burning rate and the treatment of convective boundaries , hybrid wds may be produced even by stars with initial mass @xmath4@xmath5 ; the mass of these wds could be close to 1.3@xmath6 in the extreme case of adopting a factor of carbon burning rate of 0.1 .",
    "it is easy for these hybrid wds to grow to the chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter , which could increase the birthrates of sne ia if cone wds can actually produce sne ia .",
    "note that denissenkov et al .",
    "( 2014 ) recently found that hybrid wds could reach a state of explosive carbon ignition , though depending on the convective urca process and some mixing assumptions .",
    "motivated by the work of chen et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , meng & podsiadlowski ( 2014 ) recently investigated the cone wd + ms scenario of sn ia progenitors by a detailed binary population synthesis ( bps ) method .",
    "however , a cone wd can also accrete matter from a he star to increase its mass , and then explode as an sn ia ( this is referred to as the cone wd + he star scenario in this work ) .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to estimate the sn ia birthrates and delay times in this scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our basic assumptions for numerical calculations .",
    "we present the results of our calculations in section 3 .",
    "finally , a discussion and summary are given in section 4 .",
    "in the cone wd + he star scenario , a cone wd accretes matter from a he star when it fills its roche lobe .",
    "the donor star transfers some of its matter to the surface of the wd , which leads to the increase of the wd mass .",
    "if the wd grows up to 1.378@xmath7 , we assume that it explodes as an sn ia .",
    "based on the optically thick wind model ( hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ) , wang et al .",
    "( 2009a ) have already obtained a dense model grid leading to sne ia with solar metallicity for various initial wd masses except for @xmath8 . adopting the assumptions of wang et al .",
    "( 2009a ) , we obtained the initial parameter space leading to sne ia for @xmath9=@xmath8 .",
    "figure 1 presents the contours leading to sne ia for different initial wd masses .    in order to obtain sn  ia birthrates and delay times , a series of monte carlo simulations in the bps approach",
    "are performed . for each bps realization",
    ", we used hurley s rapid binary evolution code ( hurley et al . 2002 ) to follow the evolution of 4@xmath2@xmath10 sample binaries .",
    "following the work of meng & podsiadlowski ( 2014 ) , we also assumed that , if the mass of a wd is less than the most massive hybrid one shown in figure 5 of chen et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and is not a co wd , then it is a hybrid cone wd .",
    "these binaries are followed from star formation to the formation of the cone wd + he star systems based on three binary evolutionary channels ( i.e. , _ he star , eagb _ and _ tpagb channels _ ; see wang et al .",
    "if the initial parameters of a cone wd + he star system are located in the sn ia production regions in the plane of initial orbital period and initial companion mass for its specific initial wd mass ( figure 1 ) , then an sn ia is assumed to be formed .",
    "the factors of the carbon burning rate are set to 0.1 , 1 and 10 based on the figure 5 in chen et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "we conduct eight sets of monte carlo simulations to examine their influence on the sn ia birthrates , where we set the bps parameters over a reasonable range ( see wang et al .",
    "the details of the initial conditions for the bps simulations are given in table 1 .",
    "a summary of the various given initial conditions is as follows : ( 1 ) either constant star formation rate ( sfr ) over the past 14gyrs or , alternatively , it is modeled as a delta function in the form of a single starburst .",
    "( 2 ) the initial mass function ( imf ) is from either miller & scalo ( 1979 , ms79 ) or scalo ( 1986 , s86 ) .",
    "( 3 ) a mass - ratio distribution ( @xmath11 ) that is either constant , rising or calculated from the case in which both binary components are chosen randomly and independently from the imf ( uncorrelated ) . ( 4 ) all stars are assumed to be members of binaries which have an initially circular orbit .",
    "( 5 ) the distribution of initial orbital separations is assumed to be constant in @xmath12 for wide binary systems , in which @xmath13 is the orbital separation ( e.g. , han et al .",
    "( 6 ) the standard equations describing energy are used to calculate the output during the common - envelope ( ce ) phase ( e.g. , webbink 1984 ) .",
    "similar to our previous studies ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2009b ) , we use a single free parameter @xmath14 to describe the ce ejection process , and adopt three specific values ( 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of the initial cone wd masses of the wd + he star systems that ultimately produce sne ia with different values of @xmath14 .",
    "this distribution is given at the current epoch by assuming an ongoing constant sfr . from this figure",
    ", we can see that a low value of @xmath14 tends to lead to higher initial wd masses .",
    "this trend can be understood by the _ he star channel _ as defined by wang et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , which allows a stable roche - lobe overflow , leading to form more massive wds ; a low value of @xmath14 in our bps simulations will increase the fraction of sne ia that can be produced by the _ he star channel _ , and thus tend to form more massive wds .",
    "however , we note that wd formation in the _ he star channel _ is different from origin in super - agb stars as described by denissenkov et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ; as such , it is unclear whether or not wds from the _ he star channel _ may be hybrid cone wds , as we assume .      according to the eight sets of simulations for the cone wd + he star scenario , the estimated sn ia birthrates are strongly dependent on the choice of the initial conditions , e.g. , they are sensitive to the choice of the ce ejection parameter , carbon burning rate ( cbr ) , initial mass function and initial mass ratio distribution , etc . notably , if we adopt an extreme mass - ratio distribution with uncorrelated component masses ( set 8) , the sn ia birthrate will decrease significantly .",
    "this is because most of the donors in this scenario are not massive , the result of which is that wds can not accrete enough mass to grow up to the chandrasekhar mass .    in figure 3 , we compare the evolution of sn ia birthrates for a constant sfr ( @xmath15 ; left panel ) and a single starburst ( right panel ) . according to our standard model ( set 2 ) , the sn ia birthrates are @xmath00.298@xmath2@xmath16 , which is roughly one tenth of the observed birthrate ( @xmath03@xmath2@xmath17 ; cappellaro & turatto 1997 ) .",
    "even the largest birthrate in our bps model ( set 7 ) is only a factor of two greater .",
    "this indicates that the cone wd + he star scenario can only be responsible for a part of the total sn ia birthrate ( for other sn ia formation scenarios see wang & han 2012 ) .",
    "we note that sn ia birthrates will become lower with the decrease of @xmath14 ( see the left panel ) .",
    "this is because more binaries after the ce ejection may merge with a low @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the sn ia birthrates decrease with the cbr factor ; a high cbr factor will result in a small upper mass limit for the cone wds , and consequently a low birthrate .    in figure 3",
    ", we also present the delay time distributions of sne ia obtained from a single starburst ( see the right panel ) . from this panel",
    ", we see that sn ia explosions occur between @xmath028myr and @xmath0178myr after the starburst , which may contribute to the population of young sne ia in late - type galaxies .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2009b ) found that the minimum delay time from the co wd + he star scenario is @xmath045myr , which is longer than the results obtained in this work .",
    "it seems that sne ia from the cone wd + he star scenario are the youngest of all current progenitor models .      the donor star in the cone wd + he star scenario would survive and potentially be identifiable if the wd is completely disrupted at the moment of sn explosion ( e.g. , wang & han 2009 ; pan et al .",
    "2010 ; liu et al .",
    "by interpolating in the three - dimensional grid ( initial wd mass , initial companion mass and initial orbital period ) of the wd + he star systems ( figure 1 ) , we can obtain many properties of companions when the wds grow to 1.378@xmath7 , e.g. , the luminosities , the effective temperatures , the orbital velocities , the surface abundances , etc .",
    "these properties may be observed and be used to help identify the companions .",
    "figure 4 shows an example of the distributions of the properties of companions in the plane of the effective temperature and luminosity at the point when the wd increases its mass to 1.378@xmath7 , which may be helpful for identifying the surviving companions . in this figure",
    ", we also present the final region that is obtained from the binary calculations in figure 1 ( see the dashed line ) .",
    "the possible he companion star in the sn 2012z progenitor system is located in this region ( for a discussion see section 4 ) .",
    "sne ia from the cone wd + he star scenario may exhibit some special properties . in this scenario ,",
    "the wd accretes material from a non - degenerate he star , which could result in the detection of he lines in the early spectra of such sne ia .",
    "in addition , sne ia from this scenario are relatively young and have delay times as short as @xmath028myr ; such sne ia may be detected in galaxies with recent star formation .",
    "some previous works indicate that the sn ia luminosities at maximum could be mainly dependent on the carbon abundance , i.e. , a low carbon abundance leads to a smaller amount of @xmath18 synthesized in the thermonuclear explosion , which results in a lower peak luminosity of sne ia ( e.g. , umeda et al . 1999 ) .",
    "compared with normal co wds , hybrid wds have a relatively low carbon abundance ( e.g. , denissenkov et al .",
    "therefore , sne ia from these hybrid wds could be expected to have a lower peak luminosity , and a lower explosion energy ( a relatively low ejecta velocity could thus be expected ) .",
    "it has recently been proposed that one sub - class of sne  ia is so distinct as to be classified separately from the bulk of sne ia , with a suggested name of type iax sne ( sne  iax ) , which contain sne resembling the prototype event sn 2002cx ( e.g. , foley et al .",
    "this type of sne may be excellent candidates for observational counterparts of sne ia via the cone wd + he star scenario .",
    "sne  iax have the maximum luminosities as low as that of the faint 1991bg - like events , and have lower maximum - light velocities compared with normal ones , but they show iron - rich spectra at maximum light like the bright 1991t - like objects ( foley et al .  2013 ) .",
    "so far , about 25 sne  iax have been identified , in which two of them show strong he lines in their spectra , and most of them have been discovered in late - type galaxies ( foley et al .",
    "lyman et al . ( 2013 ) found that the host population of sne  iax is very young , which can be comparable with that of type iip sne , and thus suggested that sne  iax may have a delay time of 30@xmath150myr .",
    "foley et al .",
    "( 2014 ) recently constrained the progenitor system of sn 2008 ha to have an age of @xmath1980myr .",
    "the estimated birthrates of sne  iax may account for 5@xmath130% of the overall sn ia birthrate ( e.g. , li et al .",
    "2011 ; foley et al .",
    "2013 ; white et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the above observed properties of sne iax seem comparable with those from the cone wd + he star scenario .",
    "mccully et al . (",
    "2014 ) recently found that one sn iax ( i.e. , sn 2012z ) was probably an explosion of a wd accreting matter from a he star . in figure 4",
    ", we can see that the the possible he companion star is a little cooler than our bps results , but this is merely a selection effect due to the initial conditions of the populations we consider in our bps studies ; it still lies in the region that can potentially be reached by our binary simulations .",
    "long period systems in figure 1 should contribute significantly towards the number of systems in the vicinity of sn 2012z , even though it is difficult for our current bps approach to reflect this .",
    "thus , we can not exclude the he donor star as a probable companion of sn 2012z .    however , the cone wd + he star scenario can not explain one particular sn iax , i.e , sn 2008ge , which was discovered in an old environment , hosted by an s0 galaxy with no massive stars nor any sign of star formation ( foley et al .",
    "this indicates that sne iax have a heterogenous class of progenitors .",
    "we note that some other models have already been proposed to produce sne iax , e.g. , a failed deflagration model of chandrasekhar mass wd ( e.g. , jordan et al .",
    "2012 ; kromer et al .",
    "2013 ; long et al .",
    "2014 ) , a specific class of he - ignited wd explosions ( wang et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the cone wd + ms scenario ( meng & podsiadlowski 2014 ) .",
    "observationally , some massive wd + he star binaries ( e.g. , hd 49798 with its wd companion and v445 pup ) are candidates of sn ia progenitors .",
    "( 1 ) hd 49798 is a h depleted subdwarf o6 star that contains a massive wd companion with an orbital period of 1.548d ( e.g. , bisscheroux et al .",
    "mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) obtained the masses of these two components , in which the wd mass is 1.28@xmath200.05@xmath7 and the he star mass is 1.50@xmath200.05@xmath7 .",
    "( 2 ) v445 pup is a he nova . the light curve fitting by kato et al .",
    "( 2008 ) shows that the wd mass is @xmath21@xmath22 .",
    "woudt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) deduced that the pre - outburst luminosity of the system was log@xmath23=4.34@xmath200.36 , which is compatible with a 1.2@xmath1@xmath24 he star that is burning its he shell ( see also piersanti et al .",
    "goranskij et al .",
    "( 2010 ) recently reported that the most probable orbital period for this binary is @xmath00.65d .",
    "the parameters of these two binaries are located in the initial - parameter - space contours for producing sne ia ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , they are possible progenitor candidates of sne ia . however , it is still uncertain which type of wds in these two binaries are , e.g. , co wds , cone wds or one wds .",
    "if they are cone wds , they could form sne ia through the scenario studied in this work .    by using a detailed bps approach and assuming cone wds can produce sne ia , we systematically investigated the hybrid cone wd + he star scenario for the progenitors of sne ia .",
    "we obtain the birthrates and delay times for this scenario .",
    "the birthrate from this scenario could account for 1@xmath118% of total sne ia , the specific proportion of which is strongly sensitive to uncertainties in some input parameters for the monte carlo simulations .",
    "sne ia from this scenario could be as young as @xmath028myr , which are the youngest sne ia ever modeled .",
    "we found that sne ia from this scenario will exhibit some special properties when compared with normal ones , and may explain some sne iax .",
    "we also provided the properties of donors when the wd mass increases to 1.378@xmath7 .",
    "these properties are a starting point for investigating the surviving companions of sne ia . in order to set further constraints on the hybrid cone wd + he star scenario , large samples of massive wd + he star systems and surviving companions are needed .",
    "we hope that our work stimulates numerical simulations on thermonuclear explosions of hybrid cone wds .",
