    "there exists clear evidence for mass discrepancies in extragalactic systems .",
    "application of the usual newtonian dynamical equations to the observed luminous mass does not predict the observed motions .",
    "this leads to the inference of dynamically dominant amounts of dark matter .    in a preceding paper we described the many difficulties that arise in trying to understand the data in terms of dark matter ( mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; hereafter paper i ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the alternative of a change in the fundamental equations of motion as the cause of the observed mass discrepancies .",
    "many alternative theories of gravity have been posited to this end , but most have been ruled out ( sanders 1986 ) .",
    "a few which may still appear to be viable are not in the light of data for low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "length - scale dependent alteration of the inverse square law ( the generic cases discussed by liboff 1992 or the nonsymmetric gravity of moffat & sokolov 1996 ) can not explain the large variation in the scale on which the mass discrepancy appears ( fig .  3 of paper i ) unless the length - scale of the theory is allowed to vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "similarly , the linear potential theory explored by mannheimm & kazanas ( 1989 ) predicts rotation curves which should ultimately rise rather than remain flat .",
    "this is not obviously consistent with extant rotation curve data ( carlson & lowenstein 1996 ) , and the rotation curves of at least some lsb galaxies ( ugc 128 ) remain flat well beyond the point where the upturn should be observed . only the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) proposed by milgrom ( 1983a , b ,",
    "c ) appears empirically viable , so we focus on testing it .    the rotation curves of disk galaxies derived from gaseous tracers ( h@xmath0 and ) provide the strongest tests of alternative force - laws ( kent 1987 ; begeman 1991 ) . with only the assumption of circular motion , it is possible to directly equate the centripetal acceleration @xmath1 with the gravitational acceleration @xmath2 determined from the poisson equation @xmath3 or any hypothesized alternative , for example @xmath4 = 4 \\pi g\\rho\\ ] ] ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) . in no other type of system",
    "are tests so direct and free of assumptions .    to test mond",
    "we employ the data compiled in paper i ( mostly from broeils 1992 , van der hulst 1993 , and de blok 1996 ) .",
    "these are rotation curves of disk galaxies spanning a large range in size , luminosity , and surface brightness .",
    "luminosity and surface brightness must trace mass and mass surface density modulo only the mass - to - light ratio of the stars in this alternative to dark matter .",
    "previous tests of mond have given mixed results .",
    "mond does generally do a good job of fitting rotation curves ( begeman 1991 ) , but it is less clear that it works in systems other than disks ( clusters of galaxies , the & white 1988 ) . as emphasized by milgrom ( 1983b,1988 ) ,",
    "lsb galaxies provide particularly strong tests . some attempts to test mond with lsb dwarf galaxies found that it failed ( lake 1989 ) .",
    "milgrom ( 1991 ) pointed out some uncertainties and limitations in lake s analysis , so it remains unclear whether these cases constitute contradictions of mond .",
    "other attempts to fit a limited number of lsb galaxies reported success ( milgrom & braun 1988 ; begeman 1991 ; sanders 1996 ) .",
    "we test mond with the substantial amount of new data we have accumulated on lsb galaxies ( van der hulst 1993 ; de blok 1996 ) .",
    "section 2 describes the predictions of mond relevant to lsb galaxies and tests each .",
    "section 3 examines the viability of mond in other systems .",
    "a summary of the results and some discussion of their implications is given in  4 .",
    "detailed mond fits to the rotation curves of lsb galaxies are given by de blok & mcgaugh 1998 ( paper iii ) .",
    "symbols and definitions follow the conventions of paper i. we adopt @xmath5 throughout .",
    "the modified newtonian dynamics are an empirically motivated force law which can be interpreted either as a modification of gravity or of the law of inertia ( see review by milgrom 1994 ) .",
    "we are not interested here in which interpretation is preferable , but rather in testing whether mond is indeed the correct force law . in this context",
    "it should be realized that mond has not yet been developed into a full theory in the sense of general relativity .",
    "however , as a force law it makes very precise and testable predictions just as the inverse square law did well before the adornment of subsequent theoretical elaboration .",
    "the empirical motivation for mond is the observation that the rotation curves of high surface brightness ( hsb ) spiral galaxies are asymptotically flat .",
    "one must take care not to test only the fact the force law was constructed to realize .",
    "the properties of lsb galaxies were largely unknown at the time , and were not part of the input motivating mond .",
    "milgrom ( 1983b ) stated that `` _ disk galaxies with low surface brightness provide particularly strong tests _ '' and made a series of specific predictions about lsb galaxies which constitute genuine tests of the mond force law .",
    "the mond force law is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the usual newtonian acceleration and @xmath8 is a universal constant .",
    "this applies only for @xmath9 ; for @xmath10 the behavior is purely newtonian .",
    "there is an interpolation function @xmath11 with @xmath12 for connecting the two regimes ( milgrom 1983a ) .",
    "the function is required to have the asymptotic behavior @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we will not specify @xmath11 here , and restrict our tests to the deep mond regime where equation  5 is the effective force law . in practice",
    "this means @xmath15 , where the precise form of @xmath11 ceases to matter ( @xmath16/x < 10\\%$ ] ) .",
    "the mond limit only occurs for extremely small accelerations : @xmath17 ( milgrom & braun 1988 ; begeman 1991 ) .",
    "this is roughly 1 ngstrom per second per second , or @xmath18 .",
    "for circular orbits about a point mass , @xmath19 , in the mond limit , @xmath20 this gives an asymptotically constant rotation velocity @xmath21 independent of @xmath22 : @xmath23 it is this behavior that gives rise to asymptotically flat rotation curves and the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "since mond is a force law based on a modification at a particular acceleration - scale , the strongest tests of mond are provided by systems with the lowest accelerations .",
    "the stars in hsb galaxies experience centripetal accelerations of order @xmath8 .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies have very low mean accelerations , typically @xmath24 . as a consequence ,",
    "lsb galaxies provide strong tests of mond .",
    "solar system tests can be very precise , but do not probe the mond regime .",
    "the transition between newtonian and mond regimes allows us to define a transition radius where @xmath25 , @xmath26 for the sun , @xmath27 light year .",
    "one would not expect to notice mond effects until this radius , at which point the field of the milky way becomes significant .",
    "classic solar system tests near to the sun are restricted to the regime @xmath10 and only test the deviation of the interpolation function from its asymptotic limit ( milgrom 1983a ) .",
    "the same holds true for binary pulsars , which experience large accelerations well removed from the mond regime .",
    "extragalactic systems are the only laboratories where the mond regime is clearly probed . in fitting mond to galaxy data , there are several adjustable parameters .",
    "one is the acceleration constant itself .",
    "this must be a universal constant ; once measured accurately in one galaxy the same value must apply in all galaxies .",
    "we adopt @xmath28 and keep it fixed .",
    "this was determined by begeman ( 1991 ) to be the best fit to a sample of galaxies with high quality  rotation curves which has no overlap with our new lsb galaxy data .",
    "slight adjustments to the distance to a galaxy can sometimes improve a mond fit ( begeman 1991 ) .",
    "this occurs because of the interplay between the mond mass , which depends only on the distance - independent circular velocity , and the gas mass , which varies as @xmath29 . we keep @xmath30 fixed at the value determined from the assumed @xmath31 . for other choices of @xmath31",
    "there is some limited freedom to adjust @xmath8 to compensate . as with @xmath8 and @xmath30 , adjusting the inclination of a disk galaxy can improve some fits .",
    "inclination is crucial since mond masses depend on @xmath32 . in this paper",
    "we keep @xmath33 fixed ; see paper iii for further examination of this point .",
    "so far we have named three parameters which could in principle be adjusted . in practice",
    ", there is very little freedom to do this , and we will keep all of them fixed .",
    "the only truly free parameter is the conversion factor from light to mass , .",
    "we will treat this as a value to be determined and compared to the expectations for stellar populations .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss particular tests of mond with lsb galaxies .",
    "a very strong prediction of mond is a single universal tully - fisher relation .",
    "`` _ the relation between asymptotic velocity and the mass of the galaxy is an absolute one . _ '' ( milgrom 1983b ) .",
    "this follows from equation  ( 7 ) which gives @xmath34 where the baryonic mass - to - light ratio @xmath35 .",
    "note that @xmath22 does not appear in this equation , nor do the dark matter galaxy formation parameters of equation  ( 13 ) in paper i.    that @xmath22 does not appear in equation  ( 9 ) is of fundamental significance . in the case of purely newtonian dynamics ,",
    "since lsb galaxies have , by definition , larger @xmath22 than hsb galaxies of the same luminosity , they should not fall on the same tully - fisher relation .",
    "yet they do ( sprayberry 1995 ; zwaan 1995 ) .",
    "invoking a length - scale for the mass which is different from that of the light helps not at all : serious fine - tuning problems occur in the dark matter picture ( paper i ) . in mond",
    "the tully - fisher relation follows simply and directly from the form of the force law .",
    "the error budget for scatter in the tully - fisher relation in magnitudes is @xmath37 comparison of this with equation  12 of paper i shows that the term involving the central surface brightness has disappeared .",
    "the real difference is larger , though . in the dark matter picture",
    ", there should be some intrinsic variation in @xmath21 from halo to halo . in mond",
    ", mass and velocity are strictly related ; the term for the error in @xmath21 in equation  ( 10 ) now refers only to observational uncertainties and not also to intrinsic variations .",
    "all but one of the terms which should contribute intrinsic variance in the dark matter picture disappear . to obtain a single universal tully - fisher relation with little scatter all that is really required in mond",
    "is that @xmath38 be roughly constant : @xmath39 .",
    "small intrinsic scatter in the tully - fisher relation is much easier to understand with mond than with dark matter .    the slope of the tully - fisher relation , @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( aaronson 1979 ;",
    "tully & verheijen 1997 ; paper i ) , is dictated by the form of the force law in mond .",
    "no particular slope is required in the case of dark matter .",
    "a slope of @xmath42 is sometimes attributed to the virial theorem ( silk 1997 ) , but a slope closer to @xmath43 has also been suggested as the value arising in plausible disk galaxy formation scenarios ( mo 1997 ) . in any case , a constant disk plus halo mass surface density must be arranged .",
    "multi - component disk - halo models generally predict that some signature of the disk component should be visible in tully - fisher residuals , but none are present ( courteau & rix 1997 ) . more generally , there is no signature of the transition from disk to halo domination ( the `` disk - halo conspiracy '' ) . these all occur naturally if there is no halo and the disk is the only component , as in mond .",
    "the tully - fisher relation of lsb galaxies provides a new test of mond .",
    "that hsb galaxies obey the tully - fisher relation was known when mond was developed , so this does not itself constitute a test .",
    "that lsb galaxies fall on the same relation with the same normalization was not known . that they should constitutes a genuine prediction ( milgrom 1983b ) :",
    "`` _ we predict , for example , that the proportionality factor in the @xmath44 relation for these galaxies is the same as for high surface density galaxies . _ ''      if the mond force law is the basis of the tully - fisher relation , it should be possible to derive from mond the @xmath45-@xmath46 conspiracy inferred with conventional dynamics ( zwaan 1995 ; paper i ) .",
    "this requires @xmath47 constant , where  is the conventional dynamical mass - to - light ratio . in mond ,",
    "the typical acceleration of a disk is proportional to the square root of its characteristic surface density so that @xmath48 ( equation 6 of milgrom 1983b and equation  19 ) .",
    "the severity of the inferred newtonian mass discrepancy @xmath49 depends on the extent to which the acceleration is in the mond regime : @xmath50 the approximation effectively becomes an equality for @xmath51 . as a result , @xmath52 . using equation  ( 11 )",
    ", this becomes @xmath53 , @xmath54 the @xmath45-@xmath46 conspiracy does follow from mond .",
    "another test of mond is provided by the values required for the mass - to - light ratio of stellar populations , .",
    "these should be consistent with what we know about stars . since there is no dark matter ,",
    "the kinematic data provide a direct measure of the luminous mass .",
    "the only free parameter in equation  ( 9 ) is .",
    "the constants @xmath8 and @xmath55 are known , @xmath21 , @xmath56 , and the gas mass @xmath57 are measured . hence , @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath19 is the total dynamical mass indicated by mond . for spiral disks we expect  in the range of 1",
    " 2 in the @xmath60-band , with the range @xmath61 being credible ( larson & tinsley 1978 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .    the gas mass is inferred directly from the 21 cm flux multiplied by a conversion factor to account for helium and metals : @xmath62 .",
    "the conversion factor is probably closer to the primordial value 1.32 for lsb galaxies since these systems are very metal poor ( mcgaugh 1994 ; rnnback & bergvall 1995 ) .",
    "this difference is very small compared to the accuracy with which  can be estimated .",
    "we assume molecular gas is not a major mass component .",
    "high surface brightness galaxies are gas poor with molecular gas mass being a small fraction of the stellar mass ( young & knezek 1989 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies are  rich but apparently have very little molecular gas ( schombert 1990 ; de blok 1997 ) . any molecular mass which is present",
    "will be attributed to stars , resulting in  which are slightly too high .",
    "again , this is a small effect compared to the uncertainty in .    strictly speaking , equation  ( 7 ) holds precisely only for point masses .",
    "disk galaxies are reasonably well approximated by an exponential mass distribution for which @xmath63\\ ] ] and @xmath64,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are modified bessel functions of the first and second kind ( freeman 1970 ) . combining these and following the mond prescription @xmath67 gives a dimensionless factor @xmath68 correcting the simple point mass formula for the disk geometry : @xmath69 } { r^3 \\left[i_0(r/2h ) k_0(r/2h ) - i_1(r/2h ) k_1(r/2h)\\right]}\\ ] ] so that @xmath70 this is a fairly mild correction , as @xmath68 does not deviate far from unity at most radii .",
    "for consistency with paper i we evaluate it at @xmath71 , where @xmath72 .",
    "the effect is to reduce the mass somewhat as a disk geometry rotates faster than the equivalent spherical mass distribution .",
    "the stellar mass is computed as @xmath73 we have determined  in this fashion for all galaxies meeting the requirements stipulated in paper i ( essentially everything for which we have a measurement of @xmath21 , @xmath56 , , and @xmath74 ) .",
    "the results are given in table  1 and plotted in fig .  1 , which is analogous to fig .  4 of paper i.    the stellar mass - to - light ratios inferred from mond are consistent with those expected for disk population stars .",
    "in the mean , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 in the median . there is a fair amount of scatter about the mean value .",
    "no trend of  with  is obvious in fig .",
    "1(b ) . slight trends of  with @xmath77 and @xmath74 are perceptible in figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( c ) , but are not highly significant as they are strongly influenced by the low  values of a few small galaxies .",
    "the directions of these trends are nevertheless consistent with those of color - magnitude and color - size relations .",
    "mond can be quite sensitive to the parameters we have held fixed : @xmath8 , @xmath30 , and @xmath33 .",
    "it has not been necessary to adjust any of these parameters to get reasonable results from the global approach taken here . by global ,",
    "we mean that we use only the asymptotic flat circular velocity @xmath21 to determine .",
    "in paper iii we present fits to the full shape of @xmath78 .",
    "this is a different exercise which gives slightly different results for the mass - to - light ratios of individual galaxies .",
    "the precise distance to a galaxy is sometimes important because of the different @xmath30-dependence of gas mass and total mond mass .",
    "total mass @xmath44 is measured independent of distance ( for small redshifts ) , but @xmath79 .",
    "an overestimate of the distance can lead to a situation in which it appears that the gas mass exceeds the total dynamical mass . for a sample with many gas rich galaxies",
    ", it would be surprising if this did not occasionally manifest itself .",
    "indeed , it is well known in the case of ddo 154 ( milgrom & braun 1988 ; begeman 1991 ; sanders 1996 ) .",
    "examination of table  1 shows that f571v1 and f5741 might be similar cases , as both are inferred to have unreasonably small or negative .",
    "a 20% reduction in the assumed distance to these galaxies would have the effect @xmath80f571v1@xmath81 and @xmath80f5741@xmath82 .",
    "given the uncertainty in the distance scale , neither case provides a clear counterexample to mond .",
    "mond is also very sensitive to the inclination since the observed line of sight velocity must be corrected by @xmath83 .",
    "inclination determinations can be difficult and are sometimes quite uncertain for lsb galaxies ( mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ; de blok 1995 ; de blok 1996 ) . in the case of f571v1 ,",
    "becomes positive if @xmath84 .",
    "we certainly would not claim to be able to determine inclinations this accurately by information independent of mond ( paper iii ) .    in the case of f5741 , it is not obvious that the asymptotically flat part of the rotation curve has been reached ( de blok 1996 ) .",
    "if @xmath21 is underestimated , the mond mass will be too small .",
    "the stellar mass to light ratio becomes more reasonable ( @xmath85 ) if @xmath86 , which is possible within the errors .",
    "it is also possible that the factor @xmath68 we have assumed could be an underestimate in this case .    in sum ,",
    "mond yields reasonable values for the mass - to - light ratios of stellar populations .",
    "this is not a trivial result . since @xmath87 , even small errors in @xmath21",
    "can make  seem incorrect .",
    "there are a few individual galaxies for which  may seem a bit unreasonable , but is this surprising given the nature of astronomical data ?",
    "since there is no dark matter in the mond hypothesis , mass surface density must be correlated with luminous surface density .",
    "a way to see this without invoking stellar populations is through the characteristic parameter @xmath88 defined by milgrom ( 1983b ) for exponential disks : @xmath89 this is proportional to the characteristic acceleration @xmath90 of a disk and to the square root of its mass surface density ( @xmath91 ) .    by using the observed velocity and scale length",
    ", we can construct the quantity @xmath88 which provides a direct dynamical estimate of the mass surface density .",
    "values computed for @xmath88 are given in table  1 .",
    "the mass surface density indicated dynamically by @xmath88 must be correlated with with the mass surface density of ordinary matter , indicated by the central surface brightness .",
    "these quantities are plotted against each other in fig .",
    "2 . there is a strong correlation , with regression coefficient @xmath92 .",
    "the slope and normalization of the relation is consistent with that expected in mond . from equation",
    "( 19 ) , one can derive @xmath93 assuming an exponential mass distribution with @xmath94 .",
    "a formal fit to the data gives a slope of @xmath95 , consistent with the expected @xmath96 .",
    "the normalization is also correct for @xmath97 , a reasonable value given the assumption of an exponential mass distribution .",
    "deviations from this idealized case will alter the factor @xmath98 in equation  ( 20 ) and hence the precise value of @xmath99 that is inferred .",
    "the effects of mond , when interpreted in terms of conventional dynamics , lead to specific predictions for the behavior of conventional quantities .",
    "for example , the newtonian mass - to - light ratio in any given galaxy should show no mass discrepancy until beyond the transition radius defined by equation  ( 8) .",
    "after this point , @xmath100 should increase as @xmath22 increases .",
    "as one examines galaxies of decreasing central surface brightness , two effects should be apparent : the severity of the discrepancy should grow , and the radius ( measured in scale lengths ) at which the discrepancy sets in should shrink . if at every point in a galaxy @xmath101 , the mass discrepancy should be apparent at essentially @xmath102 ( milgrom 1983b ) .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot  against @xmath103 for all available galaxies ( tables 1 and 2 of paper i ) .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is computed as the accumulated mass within radius @xmath22 divided by the accumulated luminosity at the same point .",
    "mass is assumed to be distributed spherically [ @xmath104 which is an adequate approximation for present purposes if not strictly true at small radii .",
    "we have subdivided the data in fig .  3 into one - magnitude bins in surface brightness .",
    "the rise of  does appear to become more pronounced as  declines .",
    "there is no clearly defined transition radius , but all disk galaxies have @xmath105 .",
    "this may be a requirement for disk stability ( see  3.3 ) .    what really matters is the acceleration .",
    "another way of stating the prediction of mond is that @xmath106 should decrease with surface density ( equation  19 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the rotation curves as the centripetal acceleration required to produce them : @xmath107 .",
    "there is some scatter induced by inclination uncertainties and intrinsic scatter in .",
    "nevertheless , there is a clear trend for @xmath106 to decline with surface brightness , as expected in mond .",
    "the shapes of the rotation curves of exponential disks is controlled in mond by the parameter @xmath88 which is closely related to the surface brightness .",
    "milgrom ( 1983b ) predicts `` _ a correlation between the value of the average surface density ( or brightness ) of a galaxy and the steepness with which the rotational velocity rises to its asymptotic value .",
    "small surface densities imply slow rise of v. _ '' we noted in paper i the slow rate of rise of the rotation curves of lsb galaxies ( fact 2 ) .",
    "our empirical statement is essentially identical to the prediction of milgrom ( 1983b ) . as a measure of this effect , milgrom ( 1983b )",
    "suggested the radius ( in scale lengths ) at which @xmath108 .",
    "this contains the same information as @xmath109 in paper i which should thus be correlated with surface brightness .",
    "that is , fig .",
    "12(b ) of paper",
    "i is in fact a prediction of mond .",
    "we illustrate this further by plotting the rotation curves logarithmically to show their shape ( fig .  5 ) , binned by surface brightness as before .",
    "the rotation curves of the highest surface brightness galaxies rise rapidly , often reaching the asymptotic velocity within 1 scale length .",
    "the rate of rise becomes slower as surface brightness decreases .",
    "the asymptotic flat velocity is only reached at 2 or more scale lengths in the lowest surface brightness galaxies , as expected in mond .",
    "another systematic of rotation curves is that the rate of rise of @xmath110 is well correlated with absolute magnitude ( fig  12a of paper i ) . that this occurs is not predicted or required by mond .",
    "hence it neither supports nor contradicts mond .    though the rotation curve shapes are consistent with mond , the predictions discussed in this section are less strong than previous ones .",
    "the systematic trend of @xmath111 with @xmath88 is predicted to be fairly weak , and the presence of a bulge component can have an additional effect on the shape of @xmath78 not accounted for by the quantity @xmath88 defined for exponential disks .",
    "though bulges are generally anemic in lsb galaxies , they are present in the higher surface brightness galaxies in fig .",
    "the question then becomes whether mond can fit the rotation curves in detail given the actual observed luminous mass distribution and not just the exponential disk approximation .",
    "mond is known to work well in fitting rotation curves , particularly in hsb galaxies ( begeman 1991 ; sanders 1996 ) . except for a few dwarfs in those samples",
    ", @xmath78 reaches the asymptotic flat velocity very rapidly .",
    "this is not true in lsb galaxies : mond must not only give an asymptotically flat rotation curve , but it must also give the gradual observed rise .",
    "it was not contrived to do this , so detailed fits to lsb galaxy rotation curves provide strong tests .",
    "an example of a detailed mond fit to an lsb galaxy is given in fig .",
    "fits for the entire sample are the subject of paper iii .",
    "we make use of those results here with only a few comments .",
    "the prediction of @xmath78 follows with one fittable parameter , .",
    "the freedom in adjusting  is very limited .",
    "it does not have a strong effect on the fit ( @xmath112 ) and it must return a reasonable value for a stellar population .",
    "the shape of the stellar mass distribution is constrained to be the same as that of the light ;  acts only as a normalization factor and is not allowed to vary with radius .",
    "the gas mass is comparable to the stellar mass in these galaxies .",
    "there is very little uncertainty in the conversion factor from 21 cm flux to  mass , and we have no freedom to adjust it .",
    "the importance of the gas component often constrains  so tightly that in many cases the `` fits '' are effectively parameter - free . for nine lsb galaxies ,",
    "good fits were found immediately with one parameter ( only ) fits . for six others , achieving tolerable fits required adjustment of the inclination ( paper iii ) .",
    "mond is very sensitive to this since it enters through @xmath83 and a number of the lsb galaxies in our sample are fairly face - on .",
    "two parameter ( , @xmath33 ) mond fits remain tightly constrained , and both parameters are subject to independent checks .",
    "in contrast , dark matter fits require at least three parameters (  and two halo parameters ) .",
    "the two halo parameters are not constrained by any data independent of the rotation curves , leading to notorious degeneracies ( athanassoula 1987 ; kent 1987 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "the residuals to the mond fits to the rotation curves of lsb galaxies from paper iii are shown in fig .",
    "7 as a function of the critical parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the data extend over an order of magnitude range , all with @xmath113 and most with @xmath15 .",
    "( see sanders 1996 for fits to galaxies with @xmath114 as well as @xmath113 ) .",
    "each point is a measured point from a rotation curve ; the residuals of all lsb galaxy fits are plotted together .",
    "the data closely follow the line of zero residual with @xmath115 scatter , about what is expected for our errors . in absolute terms , the mean deviation @xmath116 .",
    "the strongest test is provided by the points with @xmath15 where the form of the interpolation function @xmath11 is insignificant . in this part of the diagram , not only",
    "is the mean residual small , but there is no systematic trend of the residuals with @xmath117 . for @xmath118 ,",
    "there is a hint of a systematic deviation .",
    "the difference is not highly significant , but it might indicate that the actual from of the interpolation function is slightly different than the one assumed",
    ". the explanation may be more prosaic , as some of the data are modestly affected by beam smearing ( see de blok & mcgaugh 1997 for an extensive discussion ) .",
    "there is one further consequence of fig .",
    "even though the mass discrepancy does not appear at a particular length scale , it does appear at a particular acceleration scale .",
    "mond is the _ effective _ force law in disk galaxies .",
    "the data for lsb galaxies are consistent with mond .",
    "indeed , each of the specific predictions milgrom ( 1983b ) made about lsb galaxies is confirmed .",
    "this means something .",
    "is it possible that mond , not dark matter , is the solution to the mass discrepancy problem ?",
    "there are many other systems besides disks in which the mass discrepancy is apparent",
    ". if mond is correct , it must also be consistent with tests from these other systems .",
    "tests are provided by any system with @xmath119 ; in systems where @xmath120 , no mass discrepancy should be inferred unless there is genuine hidden mass . here",
    "we review the evidence provided by other types of systems on different scales .      a class of galaxies which are low in surface brightness but quite distinct from the lsb galaxies",
    "we have so far discussed are the dwarf spheroidals ( dsph ) found in the local group .",
    "they are distinct for a number of reasons , most importantly that they are three dimensional systems supported by the velocity dispersion of their constituent stars , not rotating disks . as lsb systems",
    ", they should have low accelerations and provide a strong test of mond : `` _ effects of the modified dynamics are predicted to be particularly strong in dwarf elliptical galaxies _ '' ( milgrom 1983b ) .    that dsph galaxies have large mass discrepancies is clear ( mateo 1993 ; vogt 1995 ; mateo 1996 ) .",
    "however , it is less clear that the discrepancies are of the correct magnitude for consistency with mond .",
    "gerhard & spergel ( 1992 ) and gerhard ( 1994 ) have applied this test . in some cases",
    ", mond seems to do well , giving stellar mass - to - light ratios which are reasonable for the stellar populations of these galaxies .",
    "in other cases , the results are less satisfactory .",
    "dwarf spheroidals provide a strong test in the sense that the acceleration is low , comparable to lsb galaxies .",
    "however , they do not provide as clean a test .",
    "what one really needs to know is the three dimensional velocity ellipsoid .",
    "all that is possible , of course , is to obtain a line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath121 .",
    "additional assumptions are therefore required to interpret the observations .",
    "we must assume that the mond equivalent of the virial theorem applies ( milgrom 1984 ; gerhard & spergel 1992 ; milgrom 1995 ) and that each system is either spherical or isotropic .    in general , the mass of an isolated system in the mond regime is @xmath122 ( milgrom 1995 ) .",
    "the assumption of sphericity or isotropy is necessary to relate the _ rms _ velocity to the observable line - of - sight velocity @xmath123 .",
    "thus the effective equation is @xmath124 note that the assumed relation between _ rms _ and line - of - sight velocity has a significant impact in the geometric constant relating mass to velocity . since @xmath125 , a 20% error in @xmath121 will lead to a factor of two error in mass .",
    "this need not arise as an error . it might occur even with perfect observations simply because the true velocity ellipsoid may not have the form we are obliged to assume .    gerhard & spergel ( 1992 ) and gerhard ( 1994 ) concluded that mond fails because it yields unreasonable  for some dwarf spheroidals , especially fornax and ursa minor . by reasonable ,",
    "we mean @xmath126 in the @xmath127-band .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in the stellar content of these galaxies .",
    "originally thought to be old implying high , at least some appear surprisingly young ( mateo 1991 ; smecker - hane 1994 ) .",
    "the  of gerhard ( 1994 ) are plotted in fig .",
    "one can immediately see two things : there are no error estimates , and many of the values are in fact quite reasonable .",
    "so , do the unreasonable values falsify mond , or are the errors simply very large in those cases ?    data of the sort required for this analysis have accumulated rapidly in the period during which these analyses were performed . as a result ,",
    "rather better data now exist than did at the time of these analyses .",
    "milgrom ( 1995 ) has revisited this issue .",
    "the results he obtained using the same method and equations as gerhard & spergel ( 1992 ) are also plotted in fig .",
    "8 . within the errors ,",
    "the results give reasonable values for .",
    "the only thing that has really changed is that the data have improved  data which come from the same sources .",
    "the data continue to improve , so we repeat this analysis using the compilation of data provided by mateo ( 1996 ) .",
    "equation  ( 22 ) above only applies for isolated spheres .",
    "when a system is subject to a dominant external field ( that of the milky way ) , the mond behavior is quasi - newtonian @xmath128 with a modified effective constant of gravitation , @xmath129 . here",
    ", @xmath130 is the virial radius ( equation  10 of gerhard & spergel 1992 ) .",
    "which equation applies depends on the relative accelerations imposed by the internal and external fields : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the core radius of the king profile which fits the light distribution of the dsph in question , @xmath30 is its galactocentric distance , and @xmath133 is the asymptotic velocity of the milky way . for the latter we adopt @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135 the internal field dominates and the object can be treated as isolated ( equation  22 ) . if @xmath136 , the external field due to the milky way is dominant , and the behavior is quasi - newtonian ( equation  23 ) .",
    "as can be seen in table  2 , most dsph galaxies for which good kinematic data exist are probably influenced by the external field of the milky way .",
    "when @xmath137 , neither of these limits are really appropriate .",
    "this is the case for many objects when the uncertainties in the many parameters determining @xmath138 are considered .",
    "a significant external field can elongate the internal field and hence affect the assumed geometry , so there are significant uncertainties besetting this analysis regardless of the precision of the data .",
    "only leo i provides a test in a reasonably isolated system .",
    "where mateo ( 1996 ) gives different values for @xmath121 , we adopt the one based on the greater number of stars .",
    "in most cases , @xmath121 has only been measured in the central regions .",
    "a global mean is more appropriate , so in the case of fornax where a velocity dispersion profile is available we use it to estimate @xmath139 .",
    "we do not compute @xmath140 for two dwarfs for which velocity dispersions are listed , lgs 3 and sagittarius .",
    "the velocity dispersion listed for lgs 3 gives @xmath141 but is based on only 4 stars , so the uncertainties render this meaningless . in the case of sagittarius , the very close interaction with the milky way undermines all of the assumptions on which the analysis is based .",
    "results of our analysis of the data compiled by mateo ( 1996 ) are listed in table  2 and shown in fig .  8 together with the previous determinations of gerhard ( 1994 ) and of milgrom ( 1996 ) .",
    "our error bars are based only on the error in @xmath121 given by mateo ( 1996 ) ; they do not include the large uncertainties in the luminosity , surface brightness , and distance to these galaxies .",
    "neither do we attempt to estimate any of the systematic uncertainties discussed above .",
    "hence the error bars plotted in fig .",
    "8 are a lower limit to the true range of uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , they do show that our determinations are consistent with previous ones , when the errors are considered .",
    "most dwarf spheroidals do in fact lie in the range @xmath126 according to all three independent analyses .",
    "marginal cases are draco and ursa minor (  too high ) and fornax (  too low ) .",
    "the deviation of draco and fornax from the reasonable range is marginal ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "draco has @xmath138 very near to unity which will tend to cause a modest overestimate of  ( milgrom 1995 ) .",
    "ursa minor is the most problematic case , but even there the deviation is only @xmath143 .",
    "there is a complication in this case in that some of the velocity dispersion may result from rotation ( mateo 1996 ) .",
    "this can affect the analysis since rotational velocity enters the calculation with less weight than does velocity dispersion .",
    "also , mateo ( 1996 ) lists two somewhat different velocity dispersions for this object , both based on a sizable number of stars .",
    "armandroff ( 1995 ) give @xmath144 while hargreaves ( 1994 ) give @xmath145 .",
    "using the latter value gives ( ursa minor ) @xmath146 , not significantly unreasonable .",
    "another complication is the systematic uncertainty in the parameters of the milky way .",
    "since @xmath138 is close to unity in most cases , a difference in the assumed strength of the external field of the milky way might make a difference .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath133 could be as low as @xmath147 ( olling 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "if we re - do the analysis with this value , little changes . in most cases",
    "there is a slight shift towards lower .",
    "the exception is ursa minor , where it makes a substantial difference . for the higher velocity dispersion of armandroff ( 1995 ) , @xmath148 . in principle",
    ", uncertainties in the distance to individual dwarfs can have similar effects .",
    "gerhard ( 1994 ) stresses that  varies by a factor of 20 between fornax and ursa minor .",
    "it is true that this is a lot , but it is also true that these are the two most extreme points on either side of a sensible mean value .",
    "this is bound to happen at some level , and the degree to which it occurs here does not seem outrageous given the uncertainty in the data and the analysis .    in sum",
    ", there is no evidence which clearly contradicts mond in the data for dsph galaxies .",
    "agreement between these data and mond has generally improved as the data have improved .",
    "the qualitative prediction of mond , that dsph galaxies should have high mass discrepancies , is not in dispute .",
    "mond also appears to work quantitatively .",
    "the kinematic data which exist for giant elliptical galaxies is rather limited .",
    "this is because observations of these systems are generally restricted to absorption lines which can typically be measured only within one half light radius ( @xmath149 ) where the surface brightness is high ( bertin 1994 ) .",
    "application of these data as a test of any hypothesized force law is limited by the limited range of radii probed .",
    "it is further hindered by the fact that ellipticals are quite complicated systems .",
    "the brightest ellipticals are predominantly pressure supported , but often have significant rotation as well ( davies 1983 ) . even in the absence of rotation",
    ", anisotropies in the velocity ellipsoid must exist to give rise to the observed range of shapes of ellipticals .",
    "this is quite problematic for applying equation  ( 22 ) : we simply do not have adequate knowledge of the geometry of the orbits .",
    "for testing mond , an even more severe constraint applies . the typical acceleration at radii for which measurements are available ( bertin 1994 ) is @xmath150 extant data",
    "do not probe the mond regime .",
    "giant ellipticals therefore provide no direct test of mond",
    ". they do provide several indirect tests , however .",
    "one is that there should be no apparent mass discrepancy where @xmath151 .",
    "this is consistent with the persistent lack of a clear need for dark matter in elliptical galaxies ( van der marel 1991 ; bertin 1994 ) .    though the data may not probe the mond regime",
    ", mond effects must matter at some level in elliptical galaxies .",
    "one might expect some critical phenomenon associated with the mond scale @xmath8 . in the simple case of spherical galaxies in the mond limit , milgrom ( 1983b ) expects a faber - jackson ( faber & jackson 1976 ) relation of the form @xmath125 .",
    "if ellipticals are approximately isothermal , then milgrom ( 1984 ) also expects a fish ( 1964 ) law .",
    "mond may therefore manifest itself in the regularity of the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "the analog of the fundamental plane for disks is the tully - fisher relation . with  or @xmath149 as a third parameter , the `` fundamental plane '' of disks is perpendicular to the luminosity - velocity plane , resulting in a narrow tully - fisher relation for galaxies of all surface brightnesses .",
    "similarly , the fundamental plane of ellipticals is viewed nearly edge - on in the luminosity - velocity dispersion plane .",
    "this suggests that the same effect is at work . that there is a modest tilt to the fundamental plane merely indicates some modest systematic trend of  or the degree of pressure support with luminosity .",
    "a generalization of the fundamental plane by burstein ( 1997 ) finds that essentially all extragalactic systems form narrow structures in `` @xmath152-space . ''",
    "this is indicative of a universal scale like @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath152-structures exhibit little surface density dependence , the signature of the mond force law .",
    "elliptical galaxies with shell systems provide an interesting probe to large radii .",
    "hernquist & quinn ( 1987 ) use the remarkably regular shell system ngc 3923 to argue that mond predicts the wrong number of shells for the periods implied by the observed relative radii , and also that the slope of the radius  shell number relation is incorrect ( their fig .  2 ) .",
    "the latter argument is based on normalization to the outermost shell ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "this is a little unfair , as only the shape is predicted .",
    "the predicted shape is approximately correct for @xmath154  it is the outer shell which is deviant . unlike the majority of the shells in this system , this outermost shell",
    "is substantially offset from the major axis .",
    "alignment with the major axis is central to the argument , which assumes the shell system was created by a simple radial phase - wrapping merger event ( quinn 1984 ) .",
    "any deviations from this simple idealized case complicates the interpretation .",
    "the periodicity argument hernquist & quinn ( 1987 ) make is more persuasive . for a phase wrapped system",
    ", mond should have formed more shells than they count .",
    "this requires that phase wrapping is an adequate model and that nearly all shells have been detected .",
    "hernquist & quinn ( 1987 ) argue that it would be difficult to miss the additional shells that seem to be required by their mond argument .",
    "however , prieur ( 1988 ) did discover additional shells which had previously been missed .",
    "though a good argument , the period - number relation of hernquist & quinn ( 1987 ) does not constitute the direct test of the mond force law .",
    "the argument is based on a very idealized realization of simple phase - wrapping as the result of a minor merger .",
    "prieur ( 1988 ) shows that ngc 3923 is not as clean a system as required by this picture .",
    "indeed , hernquist & spergel ( 1992 ) suggest that such rippled systems can result from _ major _ mergers ( as already suggested from observational evidence by schweizer 1982 and mcgaugh & bothun 1990 ) .",
    "they specifically cite ngc 3923 as a likely example . even in the conventional context , they abandon the minor merger phase wrapping hypothesis which is the basis of the argument against mond .",
    "another interesting argument involving an elliptical galaxy is the apparent difference between the shape and orientation of the optical and x - ray isophotes in ngc 720 ( buote & canizares 1994 ) .",
    "these authors point out that in any modified theory of gravity , the isopotential surface presumably traced by the gas should not differ from that determined by the dominant stars .",
    "any significant difference would impose a geometrical requirement for a dark mass component .    in other elliptical galaxies",
    "buote & canizares ( 1994 ) examine there is no apparent difference in this sense .",
    "however , in the case of ngc 720 , the stars have an ellipticity @xmath155 and the gas @xmath156  0.3 with a difference in position angle of @xmath157 ( buote & canizares 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "the x - ray isophotes twist and appear to become more pointy than the optical isophotes outside @xmath158 .",
    "buote & canizares ( 1994 ) argue that the potential due to the stars can only become rounder with increasing radius , so the pointy x - ray isophotes provide geometrical evidence in favor of dark matter .",
    "this situation is rather puzzling even with dark matter , since the stars should still contribute substantially to the mass over the observed region .",
    "even though the x - ray isophotes appear to become more elongated than those of the stars , buote & canizares ( 1997 ) derive a dark matter mass potential which is more round than either stars or gas .",
    "this is less easy to accomplish in mond since there is no freedom to vary the shape and position angle of the dominant mass as there is with dark matter . nevertheless , both dark matter and mond imply potentials consistent with or slightly rounder than the isophotes of the stars and rounder than the x - ray isophotes .",
    "the interpretation of ngc 720 seems difficult with either dark matter or mond if we accept the data at face value .",
    "the basic argument of buote & canizares ( 1994 ) is based on the difference between the x - ray and optical isophotes .",
    "the x - ray isophotes are very ragged ( see fig .  2 of buote & canizares 1994 or fig .  1 of buote & canizares 1996 ) and do not obviously provide a strong constraint .",
    "paper iii provides several examples of how misleading the shapes of ragged isophotes can be .",
    "the geometrical argument of buote & canizares ( 1994 ) is valid in principle .",
    "observing many more galaxies with considerably higher signal to noise would prove interesting . at the present time , these and other data for giant elliptical galaxies provide only weak and indirect tests of mond . none of these data clearly contradict it .",
    "another indication of a mass discrepancy is in the long term existence of dynamically cold spiral disks .",
    "purely newtonian disks are subject to global instabilities which rapidly lead to their demise unless stabilized by a dominant dark halo ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ) .",
    "what really matters here is the ratio of binding to kinetic energy ; this can be achieved either with dark matter of by altering the force - law .",
    "milgrom ( 1989 ) showed analytically that mond disks are somewhat more stable than purely newtonian ones .",
    "it turns out to be very difficult to adopt standard n - body codes to address this problem properly ( mihos , private communication ) .",
    "brada ( 1996 ) developed an alternative approach based on the multigrid algorithm .",
    "this supports and extends the analytic conclusions reached by milgrom ( 1989 ) : mond disks are more stable than purely newtonian disks both locally and globally .",
    "the additional stability is fairly modest , roughly equivalent to that provided by a halo with @xmath159 ( brada 1996 ) .",
    "this leads to a further test .",
    "the stability properties predicted by dark matter and mond diverge as surface brightness decreases . in the case of dark matter ,",
    "the halo mass enclosed by the disk increases systematically with decreasing surface brightness ( fig .",
    "4b of paper i ) .",
    "self - gravity in the dynamically cold disk is the driving force for bars and spiral arms , but becomes progressively less important . at some point",
    "such features should be completely suppressed by the dominant hot halo .",
    "in contrast , the amount of additional stability provided by mond depends only weakly on surface density and the self - gravity of the disk always matters .",
    "spiral features appear feeble in lsb galaxies , but are clearly present ( schombert 1992 ; mcgaugh 1995 ; de blok 1995 ; impey 1997 ) .",
    "brada ( 1996 ) predicts the growth rate of the @xmath160 mode for both dark matter and mond ( his fig .",
    "11 ) . using the observed accelerations as a scale , lsb galaxies correspond to his mass models with @xmath161 below this level ,",
    "instabilities are almost completely suppressed in the dark matter case ( see also mihos 1997 ) .    in order to generate spiral structure internally",
    ", the disk needs to be rather heavy ( athanassoula 1987 ) . in lsb disks , it is conceivable that the minimum disk mass required to generate spiral arms might exceed the maximum disk mass allowed by the rotation curve ( see quillen & pickering 1997 ) .",
    "this may provide a further test .",
    "it may be that spiral arms do not have an origin internal to the dynamics of the disk .",
    "however , it is difficult to invoke an external trigger in lsb galaxies since they are quite isolated systems ( bothun 1993 ; mo 1994 ) .",
    "if spiral structure has nothing to do with disk kinematics , then of course there is no test one way or the other .",
    "the form of the surface brightness distribution in the field ( mcgaugh 1996 ; fig .",
    "8 of paper i ) may also hold a clue .",
    "milgrom ( 1989 ) argued that the stability of disks would lead to a transition at the critical surface density @xmath162 . above this , the typical acceleration of a disk will exceed @xmath8 and one expects purely newtonian behavior .",
    "since bare newtonian disks are subject to self destructive instabilities , they should not survive .",
    "below the critical surface density , mond lends the extra stability discussed above and a disk may assume any @xmath163 .",
    "there should therefore exist a sharp cut off in the surface brightness distribution at @xmath164 .",
    "such a sharp cut off is observed , though its precise position is rather uncertain ( mcgaugh 1996 ) . for @xmath165 ,",
    "one expects @xmath166 , consistent with the bright edge of the surface brightness distribution determined by de jong ( 1996 ) .",
    "the distinction between giant ellipticals and spirals may be dictated by the critical @xmath167 .",
    "gas dissipation tends naturally to form disk systems .",
    "however , these are only stable if @xmath163 .",
    "an elliptical galaxy may result when , whether through initial conditions or subsequent mergers , a system exceeds the critical surface density .",
    "it will not be stable as a disk , but since there is no objection to three dimensional , pressure supported , newtonian systems , an elliptical galaxy seems a natural result .",
    "the collapse of rotational support presumably has drastic consequences for the gaseous content of such a system , so one might expect a starburst to consume the gas roughly coeval with the instability event .",
    "this would leave the signature of a population dating to said event , so that at present elliptical galaxies would appear gas poor and old .",
    "this same process could also occur with conventional dynamics and dark matter halos .",
    "should self - gravity become sufficiently great in high surface density disks , the halos will no longer suffice to stabilize them .",
    "however , the dark matter picture offers no reason why this should happen at the particular scale @xmath168 natural to mond .",
    "the thickness and velocity dispersion of disks may provide a further test . in the newtonian case the dark mass is arranged in a halo , so the thickness of the disk is determined solely by the mass of the stars and the usual conventional dynamical equations . for a vertical density distribution @xmath169 ( spitzer 1942 ) , @xmath170",
    "this would lead one to expect the disks of lsb galaxies either to be relatively thick or to have very low vertical velocity dispersions since the low surface mass density disks have little self - gravity .",
    "in contrast , mond increases the binding force over the newtonian prediction in a way which increases with decreasing surface density .",
    "the modified version of the expression for disk thickness ( milgrom 1983b ) becomes @xmath171 where @xmath11 is the interpolation function of mond .",
    "disks in the far mond regime should be thinner than the newtonian equivalent by the factor @xmath172 for a given velocity dispersion .",
    "for a given disk thickness , mond disks can support a velocity dispersion a factor of @xmath173 higher .",
    "this could provide a strong test .",
    "low surface brightness disks appear to be quite thin ( dalcanton & schectman 1996 ; kudrya 1994 ) .",
    "if they are newtonian they must have quite small velocity dispersions .",
    "mond disks of the same thickness would have distinctly higher @xmath174 .",
    "moreover , there comes a surface density where newtonian disks cease to be disks at all . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider the disk thickness resulting from equations  ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) with velocity dispersions plausible for the central regions of low surface brightness disks .",
    "the only difference between these two equations is the mond interpolation function @xmath11 . for plotting convenience",
    "we adopt @xmath175 ( milgrom 1983a ) .",
    "the interesting effects occur in the asymptotic regime @xmath176 where the assumed form of @xmath11 is irrelevant . assuming the central regions of the disk can be approximated as a plane parallel slab where @xmath177 so that the vertical restoring force dominates the acceleration allows us to approximate @xmath117 as @xmath178 .",
    "this is useful for illustrating the dependence of the disk thickness on the central surface brightnesses and velocity dispersion without stipulating a specific form of @xmath78 . in general",
    ", the precise mond prediction depends on the total acceleration , and radial , tangential , and vertical components can all contribute .",
    "the approximation made here using only the vertical component is adequate for illustrating the relevant effects near the centers of disks .",
    "the most interesting effect is the behavior behavior of purely newtonian disks of very low surface mass density .",
    "the disk thickness is plotted as a function of disk central mass surface density in fig .  9 for plausible values of the velocity dispersion and disk scale length .",
    "note that as the central mass surface density decreases , there comes a point ( which also depends on @xmath174 ) where newtonian disks rapidly become intolerably thick . unless @xmath174 is quite low for very lsb disks , these objects should not be disks at all .",
    "disks remain reasonably thin in mond because the restoring force of the disk is larger .",
    "consider the actual numbers for the case illustrated in fig .",
    "a normal sized ( @xmath179 kpc ) disk with a central velocity dispersion @xmath180 is respectably thin in both newtonian and mond cases for @xmath181 ( @xmath182 for @xmath165 ) . below this surface density ,",
    "the two predictions diverge .",
    "mond disks remain credibly thin ( @xmath183 ) down to @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) . in the newtonian case",
    ", @xmath186 occurs at @xmath187 ( @xmath188 ) and by @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) the object ceases to be a disk at all , with @xmath191 . in order to have such low surface brightness disks ( which do exist ) the central velocity dispersion must be very low : @xmath192 is required to postpone the newtonian divergence to the regime @xmath193 not yet observed .",
    "global stability is not the only problem for purely newtonian disks : it is also difficult to explain the existence of cold , thin disks of low surface brightness with a purely newtonian force law .",
    "unfortunately , no stellar velocity dispersion data exist for lsb galaxies",
    ". this would be an extremely difficult observation , but would provide a powerful test .",
    "velocity dispersion data do reach to large radii in some high surface brightness disks ( olling 1996a ) .",
    "if interpreted in terms of dark matter , the mond signature in such data will be a requirement either for a large amount of disk dark matter or a flattened halo .",
    "data which reach far enough to imply a large mass discrepancy should make it necessary to put a lot of dark mass in a distribution close to that of the disk ( olling 1996b ) . in very lsb disks",
    ", there may come a point where the dark matter required to bring this about would exceed that allowed by the maximum disk solution .",
    "a related observation is the oort discrepancy in the milky way .",
    "kuijken & gilmore ( 1989 ) test mond in this context , and find that it tends to over - correct somewhat . however , they used a value of @xmath8 nearly four times larger than currently measured .",
    "this will cause a mass discrepancy to be implied by the mond equations before it actually should be , leading to an apparent over - correction .",
    "perhaps the strongest observational argument against mond at the time of its introduction was that while it worked in galaxies , it failed in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the apparent mass discrepancies @xmath194 were too large to be explained by the typical accelerations , @xmath195 .",
    "even with mond , substantial amounts of dark matter seemed to be required , an unacceptable situation .",
    "the basic picture which held for many years is that the amount of dark matter increased with increasing scale .",
    "mass discrepancies in galaxies were a factor of ten , those in clusters factors of hundreds , and even more was required to close the universe .",
    "this picture of ever more dark matter on ever larger scales has changed dramatically in recent years .",
    "x - ray observations of rich clusters of galaxies have shown that much or even most of the baryonic matter is in the form of hot gas ( david 1990 ; white & fabian 1995 ) . rather than having more dark matter than individual galaxies ,",
    "clusters are in fact more baryon dominated ( paper i ) .",
    "there were in effect _ two _ missing mass problems in clusters : the usual dynamical mass discrepancy and the fact that many of the baryons are in the form of hot gas rather than stars .    the need for an additional mass component which seemed so unacceptable for mond would now appear to be a successful prediction .",
    "it is thus important to reanalyze mond in light of this new knowledge .",
    "the & white ( 1988 ) did this for the case of the coma cluster , and found that mond still seemed to be off by a factor of @xmath196 .",
    "recall , however , the many uncertainties associated with tests in quasi - spherical systems discussed in the case of dwarf spheroidals . given the uncertainty in the underlying assumptions of sphericity and virial equilibrium upon which the analysis is based , is a factor of two a problem or a success ?",
    "andernach & tago ( 1997 ) have compiled a good deal of cluster redshift data , and quote a median cluster velocity dispersion of 695 . for a spherical virialized system , this corresponds to a mond mass of @xmath197 ( equation  22 ) .",
    "the typical hot gas mass of clusters in the compilation of white & fabian ( 1995 ) is @xmath198 .",
    "so even a crude calculation comes pretty close , especially if there is a comparable amount of mass in stars",
    ".    sanders ( 1994 ) re - addressed the problem in greater detail . for 16 clusters",
    ", he shows that the mond mass is strongly correlated with the x - ray gas mass .",
    "the mond masses are a bit greater than the gas mass ( his fig .",
    "3 ) indicating some additional mass in stars .",
    "a more thorough investigation of this particular test would require a great deal more data than are available to us : combined x - ray and optical observations giving good estimates of the mass in each component and accurate velocity dispersions .",
    "obtaining the full optical luminosity of a cluster is far from trivial ( impey 1988 ) , and x - ray observations still lack the spatial resolution to guarantee the validity of the assumption of isothermality . obtaining",
    "a reliable velocity dispersion from a sample of galaxies that are truly virialized is also challenging .",
    "interlopers and substructure could play a strong role is distorting the mass - indicative velocity dispersion .",
    "a 40% overestimate of @xmath121 would imply a mond mass a factor of 4 too great .",
    "this would appear disastrous if this uncertainty is not considered and properly propagated .",
    "it is important to test mond in clusters as adequate data become available , keeping in mind the many uncertainties .",
    "another indication of a mass discrepancy independent of kinematic data is gravitational lensing , both in individual galaxies ( kochanek 1995 ) and clusters ( tyson 1990 ) .",
    "since there is not yet a relativistic extension of mond , there is no clear prediction for gravitational lensing . that lensing occurs must ultimately be explained , but at present it provides no test of the validity of the mond force law .",
    "some progress has nevertheless been made .",
    "if mond is interpreted as an alteration of the law of inertia , it is fairly successful at explaining weak lensing in clusters .",
    "however , it does then predict that additional , as yet undetected baryonic mass resides in the cores of a few of the most x - ray rich clusters ( milgrom 1996 ) .",
    "this is apparently the only place where mond does not remedy the mass discrepancy problem in the sense that significant additional mass remains hidden .",
    "this is a very limited missing mass problem , restricted to the central newtonian cores of some rich clusters .",
    "these are generally cooling flow clusters , so at least some additional baryonic mass is already inferred to reside there .",
    "gravitational lensing observations have allowed entire classes of theories to be ruled out as the possible basis of combining relativity and mond ( bekenstein & sanders 1994 ) .",
    "this does not mean none can exist .",
    "one attempt at such a theory ( sanders 1997 ) has an interesting consequence . in this case , the mass distribution that would be inferred when interpreted in terms of dark matter is the same for both lensing and kinematical observations .",
    "hence , observational agreement between such observations does not uniquely require a dark matter interpretation .",
    "observations of the motions of galaxies now extend over very large scales .",
    "these do not provide strong tests of mond , since we must make crude assumptions about the mass distribution .",
    "we can , however , address the consistency of mond with current observations on a qualitative level .    that there are large ( @xmath199 mpc ) voids and filaments in the large scale galaxy distribution is now regularly reproduced by simulations of structure formation .",
    "it is worth recalling that these features initially came as a great surprise ( de lapparent 1986 ) : the universe was suppose to be homogeneous on these large scales .",
    "that these large , sharp features exist makes a reasonable amount of sense in the presence of a force law which is effectively enhanced on large scales , as does the occasional inference of an excessive mass concentration like the great attractor ( lynden - bell 1988 ) .    where dynamical measurements exist , these large scale structures can be used as crude tests of mond .",
    "milgrom ( 1997 ) presents an analysis of the perseus - pisces filament , and derives @xmath200 .",
    "this is fairly reasonable considering the crude assumptions that must be made ( that the structure is a virialized linear feature ) and that it may well contain substantial amounts of gas .",
    "the expansion of voids could provide another test .",
    "as underdense regions , voids _ must _ expand in the conventional picture .",
    "this need not be the case in mond , for which the effective potential is logarithmic on large scales .",
    "a spherical shell mass distribution will eventually turn around and collapse regardless of its interior density ( felten 1984 ) , so one might expect to see some voids expanding and others contracting . in the one case where careful distance as well as redshift measurements have been made ( bothun 1992 ) , no expansion is detected ( @xmath201 of the void diameter in @xmath202 ) .    on the largest scales",
    ", mond does require a universe composed entirely of baryons .",
    "it may therefore seem troubling that dynamical estimates of the mass density are persistently around @xmath203 , much higher than the baryon density allowed by primordial nucleosynthesis , @xmath204 .",
    "these estimates of @xmath205 are of course based on the usual newtonian equations , and mond will require much less mass . as with all mass discrepancies , the amount by which @xmath205 is overestimated depends on the typical acceleration scale",
    "probed : @xmath206    it is difficult to estimate @xmath106 here , but as an example we make the usual assumption of homogeneity so that the density field may be approximated as a constant . the poisson equation with the usual @xmath207 then gives @xmath208 where @xmath22 is the scale which the observations cover .",
    "davis ( 1996 ) give a value @xmath209 from data which extend reliably out to @xmath210 .",
    "there should be no mass biasing in mond ( though different populations of galaxies may be biased relative to one another ) so we assume @xmath211 .",
    "this gives a conventional @xmath212 .",
    "taking these numbers at face value leads to @xmath213 and @xmath214    given the nature of the data and the necessary assumptions , this is probably uncertain by at least a factor of a few .",
    "nevertheless , it is striking that @xmath215 mond appears to adequately address the dynamical mass discrepancy problem on even the largest scale .",
    "we have taken care to review previous analyses which have found fault with mond .",
    "there is no evidence on any scale which clearly contradicts mond .",
    "some data which are cited as contradicting mond actually appear to support it ( that for dwarf spheroidals ) .",
    "it should be noted that not all previous independent analyses of mond have been negative .",
    "begeman ( 1991 ) , morishima & saio ( 1995 ) , and sanders ( 1996 ) all report positive tests of the theory .",
    "the new data for lsb galaxies we have collected obey all the predictions made by milgrom ( 1983b ) .",
    "the observational tests of mond we have discussed are summarized in table  3 .",
    "that lsb galaxies fall on the tully - fisher relation is a strong prediction of mond (  2.3 ) . the @xmath45-@xmath46 conspiracy which occurs when interpreting the lsb galaxy tully - fisher relation with dark matter ( zwaan 1995 ; paper i ) can be derived from mond (  2.4 ) .",
    "stellar mass - to - light ratios which agree well with what is expected for stars can be computed directly from the observations with mond (  2.5 ) . the mass surface density implied by the kinematic measure @xmath90",
    "is strongly correlated with the disk surface brightness  with the slope expected in mond (  2.6 ) .",
    "the radial variation of the dynamical mass - to - light ratio computed conventionally behaves in a manner consistent with the predictions of milgrom ( 1983b ) .",
    "similarly , the radii of transition to apparent dark matter domination and the typical accelerations observed in disks vary with surface brightness as expected in mond (  2.7 ) .",
    "the systematic dependence of the shape of rotation curves on surface brightness is also predicted by mond (  2.8 ) . taken in sum ,",
    "the data are well fit by mond (  2.9 ; paper iii ) .",
    "indeed , all of the empirical facts we identified in paper i describing the systematic properties of the rotation curves of disks as a function of surface brightness were anticipated by milgrom ( 1983b ) .",
    "mond also survives tests in systems other than disks .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are an important example .",
    "once thought to fail there ( gerhard & spergel 1992 ) , mond now appears to do well with improved data (  3.1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "giant elliptical galaxies provide no useful test of mond since the accelerations they experience do not probe the mond regime , at least not with current observations (  3.2 ) .",
    "the stability properties of disks appear consistent with mond , and the velocity dispersions of thin lsb disks could provide a very strong test (  3.3 ) .",
    "galaxy clusters provide another important test . originally seeming to require additional dark matter in clusters ( milgrom 1983c )",
    ", the detection of large amounts of hot x - ray emitting gas in clusters generally brings these into consistency with mond (  3.4 ; sanders 1994 ) .",
    "a definitive prediction for gravitational lensing requires a relativistic generalization of mond which does not yet exist (  3.5 )",
    ". some types of theories can be ruled out on this basis ( bekenstein & sanders 1994 ) while others remain possible ( sanders 1997 ) . on the largest scales , mond does as well as can be expected given the applicability of the available data (  3.6 ) . a very low density ( @xmath216 ) , purely baryonic universe is roughly consistent with the dynamical data which constrain @xmath205 .",
    "the second possibility implies a unique and powerful coupling between dark and luminous matter .",
    "it is possible to write down an equation which directly links the dark matter dominated dynamics to the detailed distribution of the luminous matter .",
    "this provides a new observational test of theories of disk galaxy formation within the standard dark matter paradigm .",
    "since mond always fits disk galaxy rotation curves , it must be possible to take the luminous mass distribution predicted for any given disk by a dark matter galaxy formation theory , apply the mond procedure to the luminous mass only , and thereby obtain the correct rotation curve .",
    "if this can not be done , the theory has failed to produce a realistic disk .",
    "there are no clear empirical objections to the first possibility .",
    "milgrom ( 1983b ) did accurately predict numerous aspects of the kinematical properties of lsb galaxies .",
    "this seems unlikely to have occurred by accident , so the possibility that mond is correct should be considered seriously .",
