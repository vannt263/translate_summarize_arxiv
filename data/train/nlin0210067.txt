    "fractal sets and measures appear naturally as invariant sets ( respectively measures ) of many nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "periodic orbit theory  @xcite provides an effective approach to computing useful properties such as averages , lyapunov exponents and dimensions , particularly when the fractal corresponds to a nonattracting set ( `` transient chaos '' ) so that direct simulation methods are harder to implement . in the case of axiom a dynamics , the convergence of periodic orbit ( or `` cycle '' ) expansions can be spectacular , see tab .  1 below .",
    "recent work has extended the theory to include chaotic systems perturbed by external noise , motivated by realism ( all physical systems are coupled to unknown degrees of freedom ) and smoothness ( delta functions are replaced by smooth distributions ) .",
    "while several approaches have been attempted , including feynman diagrams  @xcite ( by analogy with quantum perturbation theory ) and smooth conjugations  @xcite ( by analogy with classical perturbation theory ) , the most computationally effective method  @xcite has been to represent the stochastic evolution ( fokker - planck ) operator by a matrix in a basis of polynomials about each periodic orbit , truncated to finite size using the fact that the elements decay exponentially , that is , the eigenfunctions are very smooth .    the previous work  @xcite computed the escape rate of a stochastically perturbed map to order 8 in the noise strength . in this paper",
    "the same matrix method , extended to high ( 60 digit ) precision arithmetic , is used to compute the escape rate to order 64 in the noise strength . with this number of coefficients ,",
    "it is meaningful to consider the asymptotic form of the late terms , the subject of this paper .",
    "we will discover that to unlock the secrets of the noise expansion will require insights not only from the classical theory of asymptotic expansions , but also from more recent analytic calculations involving fractals .",
    "the relatively small number of numerical coefficients is compensated by their high precision , allowing a reliable fit to a functional form involving several parameters . comparing two interpretations of the series , borel summation and shafer ( generalised pad ) approximation to the `` exact '' function",
    ", we will find that exponentially small corrections will need to be considered by a future theory .",
    "at this point we note a few other relevant works .",
    "contour integration methods  @xcite have obtained the asymptotic form of noise coefficients for fixed periodic orbit length , however this does not directly determine the noise expansion of the escape rate since the latter requires successively longer orbits for higher noise corrections .",
    "direct integration  @xcite has shown numerically that the cumulant expansion on which the cycle expansions are based is valid for strong as well as weak noise .",
    "stochastically perturbed dynamical systems constitute a vast field , applying many methods other than periodic orbit theory .",
    "section 2 outlines the previous theory and methods needed to understand the results and their interpretation . for space reasons , readers interested in the full details",
    "are referred to the original works .",
    "section 3 gives the coefficients , the logic used to fit them to a particular functional form , and the borel summation or shafer approximation needed to assign a precise meaning to the asymptotic expansion .",
    "final discussion is given in section 4 .",
    "this subsection gives the background for asymptotic series .",
    "a very readable review of this subject and its applications is given by boyd  @xcite .",
    "singular perturbations of integrals or differential equations , such as perturbative approaches to physical problems , frequently have power series expansions of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is often an integer or half integer , and @xmath2 ( or rather its inverse ) is called the _ singulant _ , and is related to the nearest critical point of an integrand .",
    "@xmath3 is called the _ modifying factor _ and tends to a constant as @xmath4 ; it contains all the slower varying functional behaviour .    such series diverge for all @xmath5 , and a number of methods have been employed to make sense of them .",
    "the simplest ( albeit discontinuous ) is to truncate the sum at its smallest term .",
    "an alternative , which boyd states as usually the most computationally efficient , is to replace the series by its pad approximants , more specifically the shafer extension  @xcite in which the function is written as the solution of a quadratic equation with polynomial coefficients ; the coefficients of the polynomials are found by a set of ( typically ill - conditioned ) linear equations .",
    "while pad methods give results on average as good as any other method to this order , an alternative , borel summation , offers the possibility of systematic exponentially accurate ( `` hyperasymptotic '' ) corrections .",
    "these methods ( for example berry and howls  @xcite ) start from the borel summation method as formulated by dingle  @xcite , which we follow .",
    "the latter retains the decreasing terms , then performs borel summation on the divergent `` tail '' .",
    "borel summation is an approach in which the factorial is replaced by its integral representation  @xcite , and the sum and integral are interchanged . in the present context ,",
    "where the terms are all the same complex phase , this leads to a pole in the path of integration ( corresponding to a `` stokes line '' ) ; the constraint that the result must be real then indicates that the principal value of the integral should be taken .",
    "dingle also shows how to write the borel summed expression in terms of a few standard functions ( related to incomplete gamma functions  @xcite ) which he calls _",
    "terminants _ ; we use his method based on the forward difference expansion .",
    "more details can be found in dingle s book  @xcite .",
    "for the bulk of this paper , we will need only eq .",
    "( [ e : asym ] ) , in order to fit the parameters , and generalise it slightly .",
    "once the form for the coefficients has been established , the shafer and dingle methods will be applied , and compared with the `` exact '' numerical result ; the shafer method gives marginally more accurate results .",
    "since the coefficients are fitted , not known exactly , and our calculation does not attempt to identify exponentially small corrections ( although this should be possible in the future ) , we can not apply the more detailed hyperasymptotic methods of berry and howls  @xcite and others ( refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for extensive references ) . nevertheless , we succeed in computing a function accurate to remarkably high values of the noise strength ( perturbation parameter ) .",
    "this subsection gives the background for analytic expansions pertaining to exactly selfsimilar fractals , giving additional clues to the value of the parameter @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ e : asym ] ) and generalisations of this equation that we might expect for the noise expansion in later sections . the first paper to introduce asymptotic methods applied to a fractal problem  @xcite discussed julia sets , but is more technically involved than the exactly selfsimilar fractals in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the discussion in this section is based on ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the middle - third cantor set consists of two copies of itself scaled down by a factor of three , thus it has dimension @xmath6 according to many definitions .",
    "the uniform measure on the set located between @xmath7 satisfies the relation @xmath8d\\mu(x)\\ ] ] for arbitrary smooth function @xmath9 , which together with the definitions of the electrostatic potential @xmath10 and the moments @xmath11 lead after several steps  @xcite to the following expression for the potential near the edge of the fractal , @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are known series given in terms of the @xmath16 , which are in term given as explicit rational numbers with a well understood asymptotic form .",
    "the @xmath13 have a large exponential decay rate for example @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the oscillatory terms come from the @xmath20 solutions @xmath21 of the equation @xmath22 defining the dimension .",
    "such `` complex dimensions '' of fractals appear in a number of physical applications  @xcite .    even though the context is different from that of the noise corrections considered below in sec .",
    "[ s : osc ] , in particular the expansion for the potential has a finite radius of convergence while that of the noise is divergent , we may conjecture that there are a number of general principles applying to fractal expansions .",
    "in particular , the leading order of the expansion is not a single term but a sum of terms containing a variable ( here @xmath23 ) raised to powers @xmath24 for all integers @xmath25 , where @xmath1 and @xmath26 are determined by properties of the fractal :    1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 ( here @xmath27 ) is related to the dimension of the fractal .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 ( here @xmath28 ) is determined by the spatial scaling factor @xmath29 of the fractal .",
    "3 .   due to the rapid decay of the oscillatory coefficients ,",
    "accurate results may be obtained by considering only one or two of these terms , ie @xmath30 .",
    "note that in the absence of the imaginary @xmath26 terms ( perhaps a `` nonfractal limit '' ) , the @xmath1 in this section corresponds to the @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ e : asym ] ) since the latter effectively has @xmath1 in the exponent : @xmath31 as @xmath4 .",
    "this subsection gives a background to the numerical coefficients discussed in the main part of the paper .",
    "the periodic orbit theory  @xcite allows the computation of long time properties such as averages , lyapunov exponents , and correlation functions from periodic orbits .",
    "the required properties are related to the leading eigenvalue(s ) of an evolution operator ( defined below ) , which , in the most rapidly convergent formulation , are computed using determinants .",
    "the determinant is expressed as an expansion in traces , and the traces are expressed in terms of periodic orbits .",
    "consider the discrete time dynamics described by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the noise strength and @xmath34 are instances of an uncorrelated random variable . in the present case",
    "@xmath35 is a real number , but higher dimensional generalisations are straightforward , at least in the deterministic case @xmath36 .",
    "continuous time dynamics can also be considered ; the stochastic version has been discussed in ref .",
    "the probability density @xmath37 evolves according to @xmath38 where @xmath39 as defined above is the ( discrete time fokker - planck ) evolution operator .",
    "the noise distribution @xmath40 is an arbitrary function of standard deviation @xmath33 ; it reduces to a dirac delta in the deterministic case @xmath36 .",
    "we compute the trace @xmath41 which is an @xmath42-dimensional integral . in the deterministic case",
    ", it reduces to a sum over periodic points @xmath35 satisfying @xmath43 of the relevant jacobian .",
    "the weak noise theory is effectively a stationary phase approximation in which the leading order behaviour is given by the deterministic limit , with corrections determined by higher derivatives of the map @xmath9 evaluated at the periodic points .",
    "exponentially small corrections are obtained by considering local extrema , which are given by the `` generalised periodic orbits '' of  @xcite , that is , periodic orbits of the extended system @xmath44 ; these will be discussed later .",
    "the characteristic determinant is @xmath45 where we define the determinant in terms of its expansion in powers of the inverse eigenvalue @xmath46 ; this is consistent with our desire for the largest eigenvalue ( smallest @xmath46 ) .",
    "the eigenvalue itself can be obtained by truncating the above equation at some @xmath47 , which requires computing periodic orbits up to length @xmath42 , and solving numerically for the first zero .",
    "the leading eigenvalue @xmath48 has a direct interpretation : the quantity @xmath49 is the escape rate , that is , a uniform distribution of initial conditions leads to a number proportional to @xmath50 remaining at long times @xmath51 .",
    "other useful quantities can be obtained by small modifications of the method , for example weighting the evolution operator using the function for which an average is desired .",
    "we note that because the eigenvalue is not directly expressed as an integral , rather an expansion of integrals or the infinite dimensional limit of an integral , the dingle theory discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : asym ] does not strictly apply . in principle",
    "( although not in practice ) an infinite number of critical points are required to determine the eigenvalue .",
    "there have been two analytical approaches to evaluating the integral for the trace in the stochastic case , in particular feynman diagrams  @xcite and smooth conjugations  @xcite .",
    "these give the trace explicitly in terms of the derivatives of @xmath9 at the periodic points , but have been applied only up to order @xmath52 .",
    "a more numerical approach was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain coefficients up to @xmath53 , and it is the latter approach which is used in this paper .    the evolution operator is expressed in an explicit polynomial basis ( in contrast to the usual situation in periodic orbit theory , where all calculations are kept independent of the basis ) , defined in the vicinity of each periodic point .",
    "truncating the representation to a finite matrix is justified since the eigenfunction is very smooth , leading to exponential decay of the matrix elements .",
    "all quantities are expanded in powers of the small parameter @xmath33 , and the full trace is obtained as a sum over periodic points , to each order in @xmath33 .",
    "finally the leading eigenvalue is obtained as a formal power series @xmath54 where odd powers vanish by the symmetry of the gaussian noise distribution used .",
    "further details of the calculation are given in ref .",
    "in the previous paper  @xcite the results were limited to @xmath53 since high precision is required ( the cumulant expansion  ( [ e : cum ] ) involves many cancellations ) , and commercial high precision mathematical packages required too much memory and time .",
    "the results of this paper were achieved by code written in c , involving 60 digits precision , a maximum matrix size of 200 ( the largest matrices are required for the shortest orbits ) and periodic points up to @xmath55 .",
    "the matrix size for each orbit length and the maximum length were determined adaptively ; the precision was estimated conservatively using the results of shorter calculations . here , as in previous calculations  @xcite",

[ s : asym ] and compare the results with the exact eigenvalue @xmath59 computed using the discretized eigenfunction method of ref .",
    "@xcite which is accurate to about six digits .",
    "note that the full power of the borel summation applied to the full computed series up to order @xmath60 is not ( currently ) testable , since this is the smallest term when it ( and hence the expected errors ) is of order @xmath61 .",
    "instead , we will consider quite large values of @xmath33 , where the smallest term is very close to the beginning of the series .",
    "the only slight extension of the dingle approach discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : asym ] concerns the modifying factor @xmath3 .",
    "since the asymptotic series now has three components , with @xmath62 , it is not clear whether each component should have a modifying factor .",
    "the point of view taken here is that a single modifying factor @xmath3 is used for all three components .",
    "this choice is pragmatic ; while it is probably more natural to modify each series separately , there is no method of extracting this information from the numerical data .",
    "( 290,250 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 240,0)@xmath33 ( 0,130)@xmath59    the results of the borel summation are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : resum ] .",
    "the bunch of lower solid curves are the borel summed series , using five forward differences ( see sec .",
    "[ s : asym ] ) and from two to four terms of the series before truncation .",
    "note that the borel summed function is consistent for relatively large @xmath33 , despite the obvious approximations made in approximating the series by so few terms .",
    "the dashed line is the result of a shafer ( quadratic pad ) approximation to the first 13 nonzero coefficients , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : asym ] ; the exact number of coefficients fitted makes little difference .",
    "these two interpretations of the power series are quite consistent .",
    "the dotted line is the true eigenvalue , computed as in ref .",
    "it is extremely close to the borel summed series for @xmath63 , after which it is significantly higher .",
    "the difference may be modelled by a function which is exponentially small for @xmath64 .",
    "the most obvious candidate ( but one of many ) is @xmath65 , which is roughly the magnitude of the smallest term , and is also the first expected `` hyperasymptotic '' correction .",
    "the remaining solid curve in fig .  [ f : resum ] gives one of the borel summed curves , plus this function with @xmath66 .",
    "the dot - dashed curve gives the equivalent result for the shafer approximant .",
    "the result is a fit valid for roughly @xmath67 , indicating that the exponential part of the correction has the right form .",
    "it is reasonable to identify this exponentially small correction as the contribution of the generalised periodic orbit in sec .",
    "[ s : fit ] .",
    "however , there is actually a fractal set of such generalised periodic orbits , starting from the critical point of the map and limiting to each orbit on the repeller . the orbit given in sec .",
    "[ s : fit ] is the most probable case , but other orbits have exponents which are arbitrarily close .",
    "the nontrivial task of summing these contributions is left to a future paper .",
    "incidentally , there exist rigorous results pertaining to borel summation of asymptotic series  @xcite .",
    "the observation of hyperasymptotic corrections implies the presence of singularities in the complex noise domain , however it is difficult to understand what physical consequences this might have .",
    "periodic orbit theory of stochastic systems as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite has been used to compute the escape rate of a stochastically perturbed map to order 64 in the noise strength with sufficient precision to permit the theory of asymptotic expansions to be applied .",
    "similar to a previous calculation of an exactly selfsimilar fractal , complex exponents appear , and the parameters in the expansion were found by a combination of analytic arguments and curve fitting . although connections between this and the previous calculation were at a phenomenological level , the precise fit gives strong numerical evidence that the form of the expansion is correct to this order .",
    "finally the shafer approximation and borel summation were performed on the series and compared with the known escape rate function , giving evidence for hyperasymptotic corrections of the same order as predicted by the theory of asymptotic expansions and independently by nonleading stationary points of the action .    in the future",
    ", the analytic connections proposed between the singulant and the probability of returning to the repeller from the critical point , and between the imaginary exponent and the spatial scaling factor of the repeller , should be verified by calculations on a variety of different systems .",
    "the remaining tentative connection , between the real exponent @xmath1 and the @xmath68 dimension of the repeller would then either be verified or contradicted .",
    "the latter possibility is the most intriguing , since in that case @xmath1 could define a new `` noise dimension '' .",
