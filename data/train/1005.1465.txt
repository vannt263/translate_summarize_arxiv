    "the dynamics of biological systems span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales .",
    "the interactions among dynamical properties on different scales govern the overall behavior of the biological system , and thus form an important area of computational research in biology @xcite . a particularly interesting question in this context",
    "is how the behavior on a slow time scale emerges mechanistically from the dynamics on fast time scales .",
    "for example , how do cell population dynamics in tissues , which may evolve on a time scale of months , years or even decades , originate from the dynamics of the underlying gene regulatory networks , with a time scale of just minutes to hours ?    in this work , we aim at bridging the time scale from gene regulation to cellular transformation processes on the tissue or cell population level .",
    "we specifically consider cellular transformation processes based on a bistable biochemical switch .",
    "such switches have two distinct stable stationary states , and the cell initiates a transformation when the switch changes from one stable state to the other one .",
    "bistable switches have previously been used to model a large number of cellular transformation events , such as progression through cell cycle arrest in the maturation of _ xenopus _ oocytes @xcite or initiation of programmed cell death @xcite and cellular differentiation @xcite in higher organisms .",
    "most models for these systems are constructed as deterministic models , and thus an external stimulus is required to induce changes in the switch s state .    here",
    ", we consider transformation processes which apparently do not require any external stimulus to be initiated , and which still follow reliable temporal characteristics .",
    "reliable thereby means that in a large population of cells , the number of cells that have already initiated the transformation can be described deterministically with high accuracy .",
    "we propose a generic transformation process , where a phenotypical change in the state of a cell is initiated as soon as a bistable biochemical switch changes its internal state . in previous studies , random switching caused by internal fluctuations",
    "is usually attributed to pathological events @xcite . in the mechanism proposed here ,",
    "random switching has a regular physiological function .",
    "a striking example for the kind of transformation processes we aim to describe is involved in mammalian oocyte maturation . in mammalian females , all or almost all of the oocytes that will ovulate through the organism s",
    "life - span are already present at birth or shortly thereafter as a population of so - called primordial follicles . throughout the organism",
    "s reproductive life , follicles undergo the primordial to primary transition , which marks the start of a development process that will eventually lead to either ovulation or removal of the oocyte through atresia @xcite .",
    "in this way , there is a steady supply of mature follicles for ovulation , while the pool of primordial follicles is gradually depleted .",
    "the mechanisms through which the follicle transition is initiated are largely unknown , although a number of ovarian factors that may be relevant have been identified experimentally @xcite .",
    "importantly , the transition seems to be regulated locally in the ovary , and not through the endocrine system @xcite .",
    "an astonishing observation in this process is that in one follicle , the transition may occur already a few months after generation of the primordial follicle pool , while another follicle may stay several decades ( for organisms with a sufficiently long lifespan ) in the resting stage before growth is initiated . from the medical side",
    ", a misregulation of this process is implicated in premature ovarian failure due to follicle depletion , which is a major reason for infertility in human females .    by way of a case study",
    ", we apply the proposed transformation mechanism to the problem of growth initiation in ovarian follicles .",
    "including also cell  cell interactions supported by experimental evidence , we obtain a physiologically plausible model for this process , showing very good agreement with human clinical data on a scale of several decades .",
    "the model of a bistable switch that we use is based on a positive feedback loop between two components .",
    "consider a biochemical reaction network involving the two molecular species x and y. mathematically , the temporal evolution of the amounts of the two species is described with the ordinary differential equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the amounts of x and y , respectively .",
    "the vector @xmath3 will be referred to as the _ microstate _ of the biochemical reaction system .",
    "ultrasensitivity , which is required to achieve bistability @xcite , is generated by the hill - type production rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    in the sequel",
    ", we will assume that the molecular species x and y represent gene transcripts , and the amounts @xmath1 and @xmath2 indicate the respective transcript copy number .",
    "the nominal parameter values that we use are given in table  [ tab : param - values ] .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the parameters are symmetric , i.e.  @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter values are within the physiological range for typical gene transcription processes . in particular",
    ", the degradation rate of @xmath9 corresponds to a gene transcript half - life time of about 70 minutes .",
    "typical transcript half - life times are in a range from several minutes to several hours .",
    "the minimal transcription rate of x is given by @xmath10 and corresponds to 3.3 transcripts that are produced per hour .",
    "the transcription rate upon maximal activation is given by @xmath11 and corresponds to 33 transcripts produced per hour .",
    "this is an arguably low transcription rate , but it was mainly chosen to allow for an efficient computational treatment in the stochastic case .",
    "the basic principle also works with higher maximal transcription rates .",

    "in this paper , we deal with a fundamental question in the development of multicellular organisms : how can biochemical reactions and genetic mechanism acting on the scale of minutes in individual cells generate dynamics with characteristic times of years to decades on the tissue level ? as a possible mechanism to achieve this , we propose a generic transformation process based on a bistable stochastic switch . from the underlying genetic interactions and biochemical reactions",
    ", the process can be modelled as a continuous - time markov process .",
    "we show that the proposed stochastic mechanism generates reliable long - term behavior on the population level , with cells undergoing the transformation with an exponentially decaying rate .",
    "thereby , the decay rate is equal to the dominant eigenvalue of the transition matrix describing the underlying biochemical network .",
    "we pose the hypothesis that a biological instance of this mechanism is present in the development of ovarian follicles . to describe this process",
    ", we constructed a simple model of a bistable switch in the primordial to primary transition for ovarian follicles .",
    "the model is based on experimentally determined factors and their interactions in the different cell types constituting the ovarian follicles . although it is not assured that a bistable switch in ovarian follicles will indeed be based on the factors that we have used here , the basic mechanism would work equivalently well with other factors .    despite its simplicity",
    ", our model explains well how the long - term characteristics of follicle development may reliably be generated by biochemical reactions occurring on much shorter time scales . keeping the model simple serves two purposes : first",
    ", it shows that the dynamics of follicle growth initiation can be generated by a quite simple mechanism .",
    "clearly , additional pathways and regulatory feedback interactions that we have not included in this model can be expected to be present in the system .",
    "these may serve to increase robustness of the network , or to provide additional inputs to control the transition rate , e.g.  for the endocrine system .",
    "second , the simplicity of the model allows us to solve the chemical master equation for the network numerically , and thus to obtain a quantitative description of the model behavior .    as a possible shortcoming of the basic model on the single cell level",
    ", we observe an unrealistic large sensitivity of the follicle depletion time with respect to parameter variations . by adding the experimentally supported inhibition of follicle growth initiation by later - stage growing follicles ,",
    "the sensitivity of the depletion time could be reduced significantly .",
    "apart from the inhibition included in the model , other interactions among individual follicles seem to play a role in the primordial to primary transition @xcite .",
    "we envision that the inclusion of more regulatory interactions may further decrease the sensitivity of the depletion time with respect to parameter variations to a physiologically plausible level .",
    "in this section , we prove that the probability that a given cell has undergone the considered transformation process is given by @xmath12 as in . the proof is based on considering the solution of the underlying cme .    since the last microstate is an absorbing state of the markov process ,",
    "can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 describes the interactions among the non - absorbing states , and @xmath15 describes the transition propensities to the absorbing state .",
    "let us first derive some essential properties of the matrix @xmath16 . since @xmath17 is a stochastic matrix , we have @xmath18 for @xmath19 , i.e.  @xmath16 is diagonally dominant .",
    "thus , gersgorin s theorem @xcite asserts that all eigenvalues of @xmath16 have a non - positive real part .",
    "even more , since @xmath20 is non - zero , holds with a strict inequality for at least one @xmath21 .",
    "thus , by theorem  10.7.2 in @xcite , all eigenvalues of @xmath16 have negative real part . by the properties of the considered biochemical network ,",
    "@xmath16 is irreducible , and its off - diagonal elements are non - negative . from corollary  4.3.2 in @xcite , it follows that @xmath16 has an eigenvalue @xmath22 with algebraic multiplicity 1 and a strictly positive corresponding eigenvector @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 in the spectrum of @xmath16 .    denoting @xmath26",
    ", we have @xmath27 . from the previously derived properties of the matrix @xmath16 ,",
    "the general solution of this differential equation is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 are polynomials in @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a constant coefficient , depending on the initial condition @xmath32 .",
    "the condition @xmath33 for all @xmath30 implies that @xmath34 .",
