    "from last two decades or more , the exploration of neutron - rich nuclei is an important branch in nuclear physics research .",
    "it is a source of observance of new phenomena and dynamics .",
    "this is possible due to the development of accelerator techniques for radioactive ion beams ( ribs ) in various laboratories around the globe .",
    "experimental methods and theoretical analysis have been widely used to collect information about the structure information , such as nuclear size , valence nucleon distribution and halo structure of these exotic nuclei .",
    "the measurement of various reaction observables like total reaction cross - section @xmath3 , one- and two- nucleon removal cross - section ( @xmath2 , @xmath4 ) and the longitudinal momentum distribution @xmath5 are some of the established quantities for such studies .    the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) or the effective field theory motivated rmf ,",
    "i.e. , the e - rmf provides the internal structure or sub - structure information of the nuclei through the density distributions , using as an input while calculating the observables in conjunction with glauber model @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of one- and two - neutron knockout data for @xmath6c , explained beautifully while using shell model , which gives a consistent structure information not only for the stable nuclei but also neutrons at the boundary @xcite .",
    "it is well known that narrow fragment momentum distribution reflects large space distribution of the valence nucleon and there is a correlation of the magnitude of the @xmath2 with the width of the @xmath5 , in approaching the nucleon ( neutron or proton ) drip - lines .",
    "however , one - neutron removal reaction cross - sections provide important nuclear structure information complementary to that obtained from @xmath5 .    in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to calculate the @xmath3 and @xmath2 by using densities obtained from the rmf and e - rmf formalisms @xcite in conjunction with glauber model .",
    "it will be shown for the nuclei near the drip - line which possess a halo - structure fails to be explained by the standard evaluation of @xmath2 .",
    "contrary to this estimation , the difference in total reaction cross - section between two consecutive neighboring nuclei in an isotopic chain better matches with the experimental data .",
    "the use of rmf and e - rmf formalisms for finite nuclei as well as infinite nuclear matter are well documented and details can be found in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the working expressions for density profiles and other related quantities are available in @xcite .",
    "the details to calculate @xmath3 using glauber approach has been given by r. j. glauber @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the independent , individual nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath7 ) collisions in the overlapping zone of the colliding nuclei , and has been used extensively to explain the observed total nuclear reaction cross - sections for various systems at high energies .",

    "the deformed or spherical nuclear densities obtained from the rmf and e - rmf models are fitted to a sum of two gaussian functions with suitable co - efficients @xmath33 and ranges @xmath34 chosen for the respective nuclei which is expressed as @xmath35.\\ ] ] then , the glauber model is used to calculate the total reaction cross - section for both the stable and unstable nuclei considered in the present study .    the expression for one nucleon removal reaction cross - section @xmath36 is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the possible final states @xmath39 . in the present formalism , it is considered that the projectile nucleus breaks up into a core and the removed nucleon .",
    "the core @xmath40 has an internal wave function @xmath41 and the one - nucleon , i.e. , the departed nucleon has an asymptotic momentum @xmath42 in the continuum state with respect to the core .",

    "the notation and the numerical procedure of calculation of one - nucleon removal reaction cross - section are followed from ref .",
    "we obtain the field equations for nucleons and mesons from the rmf and e - rmf lagrangian . for deformed case ( rmf only ) , these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinners and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis .",
    "the set of coupled equations are solved numerically by a self - consistent iteration method taking different inputs of the initial deformation @xmath52 @xcite . for spherical densities both for rmf and e - rmf models ,",
    "we follow the numerical procedure of refs . @xcite . in our calculation , the constant gap bcs pairing is used to add the pairing effects for open shell nuclei . the centre - of - mass motion ( c.m . )",

    "we have plotted the spherical @xmath54 and @xmath55 for both proton and neutron of carbon and boron isotopes in figure 1 using rmf ( nl3 ) parameter set @xcite . as expected , we find an extended density distribution for proton compared to neutron in case of @xmath56c and @xmath57b due to the proton - rich nature of these two nuclei .",
    "the value of @xmath55 and @xmath54 are almost similar for @xmath1c which can be seen from figure 1 .",
    "extension of @xmath55 is much more than @xmath54 for rest of the nuclei .",
    "it is maximum for @xmath58c and @xmath59b in carbon and boron isotopic chains , respectively , because of the high neutron to proton ratio for these cases .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table 2 ]    unlike to the total reaction cross - section , the @xmath2 obtained from the glauber model , depends very much on the structure information of the projectile and target nuclei , i.e. , input densities of these systems .",
    "the nuclear single - particle energy @xmath60 for the last occupied orbit is very important for a reaction process .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to analyse the @xmath60 of the valence nucleon of the projectile and target nuclei . for simplicity ,",
    "the spherical single - particle energy for the last occupied orbit for proton @xmath61 and neutron @xmath62 with rmf ( nl3 ) and e - rmf ( g2 ) are compared .",
    "as expected , a small variant in @xmath61 or @xmath62 makes a remarkable change in @xmath63 [ eq .",
    "( 10 ) ] for many cases . for example , the one neutron removal reaction cross - section @xmath63 , for @xmath64 are 55 and 39 mb for rmf ( nl3 ) and e - rmf ( g2 ) with their single - particle energies @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 mev , respectively .",
    "this discrepancy is minimum in the calculation of @xmath36 [ eq . ( 7 ) ] with a lone exception for @xmath69 system .",
    "as the valence @xmath60 plays a major role to determine the reaction observables , one needs to reproduce these values with the experimental observation .",
    "this can be achieved by a small adjustment of the parameters in the relativistic mean field formalisms .",
    "however , the philosophy of rmf or e - rmf of single set of parametrization for the entire domain of nuclear landscape goes against this parameter fiddling .",
    "keeping this in mind , the quality of the results is compromised slightly using with the original values of nl3 , nl - sh or g2 sets .    apart from the single - particle energy , the structure effect of the participating nuclei is crucial for a reaction study . in this context",
    ", it is interesting enough to see this effect ( deformation effect ) on @xmath2 .",
    "we repeat the calculations for @xmath36 and @xmath63 with the deformed densities ( rmf only ) as input in the glauber model @xcite .",
    "we obtain spherical equivalent of the axially deformed densities using equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) following the prescription of refs . @xcite .",
    "the nl - sh parameter set @xcite for this purpose is used and the results are listed in table 2 .",
    "the reason to change the nl3 to nl - sh is the unavailability of converged ground state deformed solution with nl3 for very light mass nuclei , which is a situation in the present study @xcite .",
    "also , the nl - sh parametrization is reasonably a better parameter set and we expect similar outcome from this force parameter .",
    "due to similar reason as mentioned for the spherical nuclei , the deformed densities for some selected cases are imperative to analyse .",
    "our earlier work on density study supply us enough signature about the complicated sub - structure @xcite .",
    "the clustering and sub - structure of these deformed neutron and proton density distributions are demonstrated in figure 2 .",
    "the density contours presented are in boxes of width and height 6 fm .",
    "a uniform contour spacing of 0.01 @xmath70 is used for proton and neutron densities .",
    "the z - axis is chosen as the symmetry axis , the densities are evaluated in the @xmath71 plane , where @xmath72 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is noticed that @xmath1c possesses a @xmath73cluster with a tetrahedral configuration .",
    "the same structure is reproduced in the present study with an oblate shape .",
    "the structure of the neutron deficient @xmath74c nucleus has a prolate ground state and that of the neutron - rich @xmath58c has an oblate ground state deformation . in all the three cases ,",
    "the density plot informs that the central part of the nucleus is a compact core , which is surrounded by a thin layer of nucleons .",
    "the structure of the internal core for both proton and neutron have different density distribution from @xmath56c to @xmath58c .",
    "the shape of @xmath58c proton density distribution looks like a perfect dumb - bell .",
    "thus , it has a maximum probability to to have the structural effects on neutron removal reaction . on the other hand ,",
    "the total nuclear reaction cross - section is less influenced by deformation , may be because of the averaging in input density in the glauber model calculations .",
    "the results obtained from the deformed densities are tabulated ( see table 2 ) .",
    "table 2 shows that most of the @xmath36 [ obtained from eq .",
    "( 7 ) ] matches quite well with the experimental data of @xcite and few of them do not agree .",
    "on the other hand @xmath2 evaluated from eq .",
    "( 10 ) coincide with only @xmath75 experimental data @xcite . of particular interest amongst the nuclei investigated here are @xmath76 and @xmath77 which based on the relatively weak binding of the valence neutrons and measurements of one neutron removal cross - sections have suggested to be one neutron halo systems @xcite .",
    "the single - particle energy for proton @xmath61 and neutron @xmath62 for the last occupied orbit are given in the 11th and 13th column of table 2 .",
    "the last proton for @xmath78 and @xmath56c and the outer most neutron for @xmath79 and @xmath80 are loosely bound which are the possible candidates for either proton - halo ( or skin ) or neutron - halo ( skin ) .",
    "going back to the analysis of figure 2 , which gives us enough indication for the absence of halo - like structure in @xmath81c .",
    "contrary to the case of @xmath82 and @xmath83 a thin - layer of neutron distribution spread spatially to a large extent in case of @xmath77 , which looks like a halo - nucleus .",
    "this behavior is also reflected in the one neutron removal reaction cross - section . in this particular case of @xmath58c , the calculated result @xmath63 = 263 mb is more closure to the experimental value of @xmath84 mb than the @xmath2 obtained by using eqn .",
    "( 7 ) . if we recall the statement of abu - ibrahim et al .",
    "@xcite , then @xmath77 is a halo - nucleus . on the other hand , the measured one neutron removal",
    "reaction cross - section of @xmath76 is larger than its neighbors suggest the weak binding of the last neutron and extended valence density distribution .",
    "summarising the whole discussions of tables 1 and 2 , in general , one can say it very briefly that except few cases like @xmath85c+@xmath1c and @xmath86b+@xmath1c the spherical density used from rmf ( nl3 ) and e - rmf ( g2 ) fails to reproduce the data .",
    "when we use the deformed densities to evaluate the one neutron cross - section , the predicted @xmath36 matches reasonably well with the experimental measurement . in this case , only the result of the system @xmath58c+@xmath1c deviate from the observation .",
    "however , the results predicted by eq . ( 10 ) disagree largely with the experiments irrespective of the densities used .",
    "complementating to eq .",
    "( 7 ) , the @xmath87 matches with the lone case @xmath58c+@xmath1c agreeing with the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the axially deformed density distribution for @xmath88c with rmf ( nl - sh ) parameter set . ]     the energy dependence of the neutron removal cross - section for @xmath77 + @xmath83 system using spherical densities of rmf ( nl3 ) , rmf ( nl - sh ) and e - rmf ( g2 ) parameter sets for both elastic and inelastic processes .",
    "the result obtained by deformed rmf ( nl - sh ) densities is also given for the comparison . ]    in figure 3 , we have presented the @xmath36 with various incident energies for @xmath75 using the spherical nl3 , nl - sh and g2 densities in the glauber model calculation .",
    "we also compare our results with the deformed nl - sh densities obtained from the axially deformed rmf .",
    "all the spherical densities reproduce similar elastic @xmath89 and inelastic @xmath90 one neutron removal reaction cross - section .",
    "the deformed nl - sh densities has a large impact on the evaluation of @xmath2 unlike to the total nuclear reaction cross - section @xmath3 , which is evident from figure 3 and consistent with @xmath36 .",
    "the deformed @xmath46 value constantly over - estimate the spherical @xmath46 starting from low to very high incident energy of the projectile .",
    "in summary , one neutron removal reaction cross - sections for the neutron - rich isotopes have been calculated using the densities obtained from rmf ( nl3 ) and e - rmf ( g2 ) formalisms for spherical and deformed nl - sh parameter sets .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 on single - particle energy of the last occupied nucleon is seen in our present calculations .",
    "that means , although the total nuclear reaction cross - section does not show a significant difference , the @xmath2 values differ from each other depending on the nl3 or g2 parameter set .",
    "the @xmath2 are in good agreement with the experiments , when we consider the deformation effect in the densities .",
    "the glauber model fails for halo systems and in this case @xmath58c+@xmath1c is a typical example . in such case ,",
    "the difference between the total reaction cross - section from the consecutive nuclei is applicable to evaluate @xmath63 .",
    "it is also concluded in the present paper that the deformation effects for one neutron removal cross - section is very much crucial unlike to the total reaction cross - section @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the glauber model reproduce the experimental data pretty well while considering the deformed densities for stable nuclei as projectile . on the other hand ,",
    "when we estimate the difference of reaction cross - section of nuclei with mass number a and that of a-1 in an isotopic chain , we get good agreement with the experimental data for halo cases .",
