    "measurements of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectra  @xcite and light element abundances from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite have been corner stones in the era of precision cosmology . though standard @xmath0cdm cosmology is a very good fit to present data from these measurements , there are also tantalising hints of physics beyond standard @xmath0cdm .",
    "one such example is the possible presence of an extra _ dark _ radiation component during the epoch of decoupling .",
    "recent analyses of cmb data point towards the possible existence of one or more radiation component(s )  @xcite with no standard electromagnetic and electroweak interactions other than those predicted by the standard model of particle physics .",
    "this extra radiation needs to be _ dark _ in the sense that the presence of an extra photon like component would not only spoil the success of bbn , but also generate a chemical potential for the photon  something which is constrained by cmb observations .",
    "the indication of excess radiation arises mainly through the precise observation of less power in the smaller scales of cmb anisotropy spectra .",
    "it has also been confirmed that these hints for extra radiation are indeed ` real ' , insofar as not being a statistical ambiguity from the choice of confidence interval  @xcite .",
    "recently , the evidence was bolstered through the possible indication of ultra light sterile neutrino states in the neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite and also through the reactor neutrino anomaly @xcite .",
    "the nature of the dark radiation component is a topic of much debate .",
    "current data allow the dark radiation component to be comprised by both sterile neutrinos as well as active neutrinos with a nonthermal distribution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if dark radiation is comprised by massless sterile neutrinos , we expect them to behave as relativistic particles with effective sound speed @xmath1 and viscosity parameter @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 .",
    "possible deviations from these values could indicate nonstandard interactions in the neutrino sector @xcite .",
    "luckily , measurements of cmb anisotropies can help in constraining these parameters @xcite and most analyses are consistent with the @xmath3 ( see e.g. @xcite ) - although @xcite reported on finding @xmath4 .",
    "the bottom line is that cosmological data is sensitive to the details of dark radiation and can help in predicting its nature .",
    "the helium abundance @xmath5 is very sensitive to the expansion rate of the universe ( and hence the amount of radiation present ) at the time when @xmath6 .",
    "however , the evidence for extra radiation from bbn data is somewhat ambiguous . in some analyses ,",
    "it is reported that one can accommodate one extra dark radiation component  @xcite , while in other works it is concluded that there is no need for extra radiation during bbn  @xcite .",
    "the former of these studies , for example , found @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the confusion is that @xmath8 is highly sensitive to how the helium abundance is treated in the analysis  @xcite .",
    "in general , from many data analyses , it remains a possibility that the central value for the number of relativistic degrees of freedom allowed by cmb data is higher than that of bbn .",
    "taking cmb data alone , the estimate is @xmath9 from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) 7-year with atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) data  @xcite .",
    "combined wmap and south pole telescope ( spt ) data give a slightly lower value of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the addition of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data and the measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath11 improves these constraints somewhat .",
    "it is found that @xmath12 for wmap+act+bao+@xmath11  @xcite and @xmath13 for wmap+spt+bao+@xmath11  @xcite . taken at face value , the latter two results suggest @xmath14 evidence for extra relativistic species .",
    "the planck satellite will dramatically increase the precision of the inferred value of @xmath15  @xcite and should be able to find a mismatch ( if there is one ) between @xmath16 and @xmath17 at the level of @xmath18  @xcite .    to explain the apparent radiation excess , one can , of course , just add a weakly interacting neutrino - like fermion by hand .",
    "however , then the question remains of explaining the origin of such a particle .",
    "for a recent particle physics model explaining the radiation excess with three flavours of light right - handed neutrinos , though , see @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for another explanation of excess radiation during decoupling through the bose - einstein condensation of a coherently oscillating dark matter axion .",
    "we would like to point out that though lsnd  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite indicate the existence of one or more ev scale sterile neutrinos  @xcite , which are excellent candidates for the excess radiation hinted by small scale cmb data , it is very hard to reconcile two ev scale sterile neutrinos as dark radiation with the large scale structure and other measurements @xcite unless sterile neutrinos have other interactions  @xcite .",
    "so , it is highly possible that the dark radiation may be a result of dark sector physics .",
    "for instance , if dark matter decays into dark radiation , that can explain the dark radiation excess and its effect could be found in the structure formation of the universe .",
    "note that some hidden sector models @xcite motivated by other issues of particle physics and cosmology can also provide extra @xmath19 .",
    "+ if it is indeed the case that there is a change ( increase ) in the number of radiation degrees of freedom between the epoch of bbn and cmb , that will be an extremely interesting and surprising result . from a theoretical point of view , some new physics has to set in at a low energy scale @xmath20 .",
    "recently , there have been a few interesting works in this line of thought @xcite , where @xmath21 . from a particle physics view point",
    ", this indicates that a particle ( beyond the frame work of the standard model ) has to decay @xcite into an extra dark radiation component in between the epoch of bbn and photon decoupling .    in this paper",
    "we propose a very simple mechanism where one naturally generates an extra radiation component when the universe approaches the era of matter radiation equality and decoupling .",
    "the basic idea is to allow dark matter to interact with and decay into dark radiation : as the universe approaches matter radiation equality ( mre ) , the density of dark matter starts to dominate the universal energy budget . as a result of the interaction , the densities of dark matter and dark radiation",
    "are proportional , hence the density of dark radiation increases as we approach mre . in this scenario ,",
    "one would naturally see an increase in the dark radiation component after bbn but before decoupling .",
    "one extra advantage of this scenario is the fact that the decay naturally reduces the amount of dark matter in galaxies and clusters . as a consequence it may help to alleviate @xcite the well known small scale structure issues in @xmath0cdm cosmology - the problems with cuspy cores and overproduction of satellite galaxies in numerical simulations of structure formation @xcite .",
    "we leave the details of this as possible future work .    in this paper",
    "we solve for the dark radiation density as a function of redshift numerically and show that we can obtain @xmath22 as the universe approaches the epoch of photon decoupling .",
    "we confront this generic scenario with the present cosmological data .",
    "we take a model - independent approach , where we use wmap with either act or spt data to constrain the fraction of the dark matter density which is allowed to be converted into dark radiation .",
    "we show that one can easily find a viable region in parameter space where @xmath23 can be greater than @xmath24 by of order unity .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ interaction ] , we quantify the production of dark radiation and solve for the background solution .",
    "we present an analytical expression of @xmath19 and plot its dependence on scale factor and the coupling between dark matter and dark radiation . in section  [ perturbations ] , we derive the cosmological perturbation equations for our scenario and , in section  [ cosmomc ] , we discuss our main numerical results from a cosmomc analysis using various datasets .",
    "we demonstrate that observations are consistent with @xmath25 around decoupling and @xmath26 around bbn . in section  [ origin ] , we present a specific model in which the dark radiation production can be realised and constrain the model parameters .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "if dark radiation belongs to the dark sector along with dark matter , an interaction between the two could be possible . a general coupling ( at the background level )",
    "can be described by the energy balance equations @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the dark matter / radiation energy densities and @xmath30 is the hubble rate , where @xmath31 is the scale factor and an overdot denotes the derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath32 . for our case of dark matter being converted into dark radiation then @xmath33 .",
    "the rate of energy transfer is given by @xmath34 ",
    "a positive @xmath34 denotes the direction of energy transfer from dark matter to dark radiation .",
    "a non - zero @xmath34 means that dark matter no longer redshifts exactly as @xmath35 and also that dark radiation does not redshift as @xmath36 .",
    "it is important to remind ourselves that we require a covariant form for the energy momentum transfer @xmath34 .",
    "several papers over the recent years have studied different forms of the energy transfer rate @xmath34 in the context of interacting dark matter - dark energy @xcite .",
    "we adopt the covariant form of energy momentum transfer 4-vector introduced in @xcite @xmath37 where the form of interaction rate @xmath38 depends on the details of the particle physics of the decay process .",
    "many forms of @xmath38 has been studied in literature , we adopt a simple case where @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a constant and @xmath41 is the hubble rate . as discussed in @xcite , an implicit assumption behind this form of @xmath38",
    "is that the interaction rate varies with time but not with space , which explains the presence of @xmath41 in the place of the interaction rate in eq .",
    "[ eq : covq ] .",
    "this form of @xmath38 can arise from different models of dark matter decay . in section  [ origin ] , we demonstrate a model of dark matter decaying into dark radiation and we show that the above mentioned form of @xmath38 can be easily realised in nature .    for this form of the coupling it is easy to solve the background energy density equations  @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 the equation for @xmath29 can be collected into two terms @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant .",
    "the first part behaves like a standard radiation density and the second part behaves like a fluid with an equation of state @xmath46 . in the case of a weak coupling between dark matter and dark radiation , we require that @xmath40 is small , which in turn leads to @xmath47 . in the following we only keep the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : rhodark ] .",
    "this is further justified by the fact that the fraction of @xmath29 , which redshifts like @xmath36 , will be subdominant to the fraction which redshifts like dark matter due to the expansion of the universe .    with this assumption",
    "we obtain @xmath48 as we will see later from our numerical analysis , @xmath49 , so the ratio reduces to @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , in section 6 we study a model of dark matter decay for a specific interaction and decay mechanism where our assumption is realised .",
    "this means that the pure radiation - like component ( the term with coefficient @xmath45 ) is indeed absent .      in the standard cosmological scenario ,",
    "it is a standard practice to define @xmath19 by @xmath51   \\rho_{\\gamma}\\ , ,    \\label{rhorad}\\ ] ] where the radiation density @xmath52 is given as a sum of the energy density in photons @xmath53 and standard model neutrinos . in the standard model",
    "this predicts @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "any departure from the standard scenario is parameterized as @xmath56 .",
    "one implicit assumption in the above definition is that the dark matter dilutes as @xmath35 .",
    "but in our case neither dark matter nor dark radiation dilutes in the standard way .",
    "this means we can not simply use the definition above  a more appropriate model independent method is needed to compare the expansion rate @xmath41 to that of the standard model @xmath57 and attribute the difference to @xmath58 . in our model @xmath59 where @xmath60 stands for the normal radiation and dark energy components .",
    "we then compare to the standard @xmath57 ( with non - zero @xmath19 ) to obtain @xmath61 using the above definition we find that @xmath19 depends on the decay constant @xmath40 as well as scale factor @xmath31 .",

    "it is interesting to note that at an early epoch deep in the radiation - dominated era , when the dark matter density is negligible , the deviation from the standard expansion rate is close to zero , as expected . at late times ",
    "after @xmath67  the expansion rate again approaches the standard model expansion rate , as demonstrated in fig .",

    "we find an upper bound on this fraction using a cosmomc analysis and show that it is possible to get an increase in @xmath8 by of order unity as the universe approaches the epoch of photon decoupling .",
    "however , the effect on the temperature power spectrum is somewhat different than adding in extra relativistic species by hand , most noticeably in the suppression of the first acoustic peak . for this reason , if planck confirms the mismatch between @xmath150 and @xmath151 , it remains to be seen how well the decaying dark matter model fits data .    as a phenomenological example we have presented a model of dark matter decay and calculated the decay rate as a function of the coupling between cdm and dark radiation .",
    "+ dark matter decaying into dark radiation could also have important implications for cosmological structure formation . very recently",
    "the observations of high redshift massive galaxy clusters @xcite has put @xmath0cdm cosmology under stringent constraints @xcite . in fact , the presence of extra dark radiation during the cmb epoch may play a role in resolving these issues @xcite . note in this context that in fig .",
    "[ fig : plots ] we have showed that the decay of the gravitational potential during decoupling is suppressed in the decaying dark matter model .",
    "this may boost early structure formation as discussed above .",
    "the detailed study of this effect in the context of our model is beyond the scope of this paper and we leave it for future work .",
