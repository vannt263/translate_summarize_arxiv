    "the study of eleven dimensional @xmath7 invariant half - bps supergravity configurations started in @xcite .",

    "when there is an extra rotational @xmath8 isometry , there exists an implicit change of variables mapping the latter to a laplace equation , and consequently , to an electrostatic problem .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the geometry of smooth and singular configurations with these symmetries at finite radius of curvature .    unlike the case of @xmath9 bps configurations in type iib with @xmath10 symmetry where the precise boundary conditions imposed by regularity were explicitly spelled out in @xcite , a similar treatment of their eleven dimensional counterparts was still missing .",
    "there was no understanding of neither the electrostatic configuration responsible for the asymptotics nor the boundary conditions describing the physical solutions to the laplace equation . in this paper",
    "we provide a precise answer to both questions , allowing us to state the precise boundary problem describing the most general smooth and singular configurations with these symmetries and to compute their masses .",
    "just as smooth translationally invariant configurations have a finite discrete set of conducting disks as their building blocks @xcite , the same will be true for the rotationally invariant ones .",
    "first , we study the vacuum configurations .",
    "ads@xmath1s@xmath2 is described by a semi - infinite line charge density and a single conducting disk attached to it .",
    "the electrostatic problem is that of solving laplace s equation in the presence of a background potential , due to the line charge density , inducing some charge on the conducting disk , with the boundary condition that the potential at the disk is some given constant value .",
    "the latter is an integral equation with a unique solution found by copson @xcite .",
    "the potential at the disk is fixed by regularity , whereas its size determines the ads radius of curvature .",
    "ads@xmath3s@xmath4 has a similar structure but instead of a finite conducting disk , it involves an infinite conducting plane .",
    "the electrostatic problem can be solved by the method of images .",
    "the distance between the line charge density and this plane determines the ads@xmath11 radius of curvature .",
    "a given configuration allows an infinite number of equivalent electrostatic descriptions due to the existence of conformal invariance in the original llm coordinates @xcite .",
    "we describe the effect that these conformal transformations have on the electrostatic data describing a single geometry .",
    "excited configurations are obtained either by moving the original conducting disk in the ads@xmath1s@xmath2 or by adding extra finite conducting disks .",
    "we identify the set of coupled integral equations dealing with the appropriate boundary conditions to this problem , but we only discuss the simplest example for such excited configurations .",
    "even though we can not solve for the most general smooth configurations , we compute their masses .",
    "we do this by examining the electrostatic potential in a multipole expansion at large distances .",
    "matching the asymptotic metric expansion with the one for the singular superstar configurations @xcite , whose mass is well - known , we obtain @xmath12 where @xmath13 stands for the mass in an asymptotic ads@xmath14 with radius of curvature @xmath15 .",
    "these expressions are the finite curvature gravity analogues of similar results obtained in field theory , either by analysing the spectrum of half - bps configurations @xcite in abjm @xcite or by considering the @xmath16 limit in some matrix model dual formulations @xcite associated to taking the penrose limit in the gravity description .",
    "the singular type iib superstar geometry was described in terms of a continuous distribution of rings and the origin of the singularity was interpreted in terms of coarse - graining of the quantum mechanical information characterising the quantum state in the fermionic phase space formulation of the system @xcite .",
    "we prove that the ads@xmath1s@xmath2 and ads@xmath3s@xmath4 superstars @xcite are described in terms of continuous distributions of conducting disks .",
    "any such distribution will describe a singular geometry , because the radial electric field component must vanish inside the continuous conductor .",
    "geometrically , this forces both the 5-sphere and 2-sphere shrink to zero size at the same time in a non - smooth way , while the time coordinate becomes null .",
    "we develop a general boundary condition describing general superstar - like singular configurations in terms of the shape of the continuous boundary distribution of disks .",
    "the connection between singular geometries and continuous conductors was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "they used the statistical methods developed in @xcite , to identify singular geometries dual to thermal / typical states in different ensembles of half - bps states .",
    "it would be interesting to identify a generic singular configuration in terms of typical states in abjm . to achieve that one needs to understand the precise dictionary between the shape of the conductor and the properties of the quantum states in the field theory .",
