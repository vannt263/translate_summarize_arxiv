    "the large area telescope onboard the _ fermi _ satellite ( _ fermi_-lat , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has opened a new era for pulsar astronomy , by detecting @xmath7ray pulsations ( at e@xmath8100 mev ) from more than 120 pulsars , about 30% of which are not detected at radio wavelengths .",
    "the middle - aged psr j0357 + 3205 ( characteristic age @xmath9 myr ) is one of the most interesting radio - quiet pulsars discovered in blind periodicity searches in _",
    "fermi_-lat data @xcite . its high @xmath0-ray flux ( it is included in the _",

    "* ) , low spin - down luminosity ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath3 ) and off - plane position ( galactic latitude @xmath11 ) point to a small distance of about 500 pc .",
    "we investigated the field of psr j0357 + 3205 with a joint x - ray and optical program with _",
    "chandra _ and the noao mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak .",
    "this allowed us to identify the soft x - ray counterpart of the pulsar as an unremarkable source , looking fainter ( and colder ) than other well known middle - aged pulsars @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , our deep _",
    "observation unveiled the existence of a very large , elongated feature of diffuse x - ray emission , apparently originating at the pulsar position and extending for more than @xmath12 ( corresponding to @xmath13 pc at the distance of 500 pc , assuming no inclination with respect to the plane of the sky ) , with a hard spectrum consistent both with a power law and with a hot thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "elongated `` tails '' of diffuse emission have been associated with several rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and explained as bow - shock pulsar wind nebulae ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , where their elongated morphology is `` velocity - driven '' .",
    "indeed , if the pulsar moves supersonically through the interstellar medium , the termination shock of the pulsar wind assumes a `` bullet '' morphology , due to ram pressure .",
    "particles accelerated at the shock emit synchrotron radiation and cool down , confined by ram pressure in an elongated region aligned with the pulsar space velocity .",
    "however , explaining the nature of the nebula associated with psr j0357 + 3205 turned out to be very challenging .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the standard picture can not apply here since the morphology is very different from the `` cometary '' shape which characterizes all other x - ray bow - shock nebulae .",
    "there is no emission in the surroundings of the pulsar , where the brightest portion ( the termination shock ) should be  indeed , the surface brightness grows as a function of the distance from psr j0357 + 3205 .",
    "moreover , there are no evidences for spectral evolution as a function of the position , at odds with expectations for a population of particles injected at the shock and cooling via synchrotron radiation",
    ".    other pictures could be explored .",
    "for instance , psr b2224 + 65 , the fast moving pulsar powering the well known `` guitar nebula '' seen in h@xmath6 @xcite , displays an elongated x - ray feature which is reminiscent of the one of our target and can not be a bow - shock nebula because it is misaligned by @xmath14 with respect to the direction of the proper motion @xcite .",
    "thus , the possibility of a ballistic jet ( similar to active galactic nuclei ) , or the hypothesis of a nebula confined by a pre - existing , large scale magnetic field in the interstellar medium have been proposed @xcite .    indeed , a crucial piece of information in order to understand the physics of the huge elongated feature associated with psr j0357 + 3205 is the direction of the pulsar proper motion .",
    "detecting a pulsar angular displacement aligned with the nebula s main axis would link the morphology of the diffuse structure to the pulsar velocity .",
    "conversely , if it were misaligned , the case of psr j0357 + 3205 would become very similar to the one of psr b2224 + 65 and would require a different explanation for the nature of the nebula .",
    "usually , a pulsar proper motion is measured in the radio band , or , more rarely , in the optical domani .",
    "unfortunately , our target is radio - quiet and has no optical counterpart ; moreover , timing analysis of gamma - ray photons is not particularly sensitive to the proper motion ( positional accuracy based on 5 yr of _",
    "fermi_-lat timing is estimated to be @xmath15 , * ? ? ?",
    "the only way to search for a possible proper motion rests on the comparison of multi - epoch , high - resolution x - ray images . to this aim",
    ", we have obtained a multi - cycle observing campaign with chandra , consisting of two observations to be performed at the end of 2011 and at the end of 2013 .",
    "we will report here on the first observation of our program , as well as on a very recent observation of the field in the h@xmath6 band performed with gmos instrument at the gemini north telescope .",
    "indeed , pulsars moving supersonically into warm interstellar gas can generate optical emission in the h@xmath6 line , due to collisional excitation of neutral hydrogen and charge exchange occurring at ( and behind ) the forward shock ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yielding a limb - brightened , arc - shaped bow - shock nebula , located at the apex of the forward shock , in the direction of the proper motion .",
    "the superb angular resolution of the _ chandra _ optics makes it possible to measure tiny angular displacements of an x - ray source by performing relative astrometry on multi - epoch images .",
    "indeed , such an approach has already been used to measure the proper motion of a few isolated neutron stars . see e.g. our investigation for the case of sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite , as well as the work by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .      our new observation of psr j0357 + 3205 with _",

    "all data were collected using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) instrument in timed exposure mode with the vfaint telemetry mode .",
    "we retrieved `` level 1 '' data from the _ chandra _ science archive and reprocessed them with the chandra_repro script of the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observation software ( ciao v4.4 ) .    for each observation",
    ", we generated an image in the 0.38 kev energy range using the original acis pixel size ( @xmath16/pixel ) .",
    "we performed a source detection using the wavdetect task with wavelet scales ranging from 1 to 16 pixels with a @xmath17 step size , setting a detection threshold of @xmath18 . in all observations ,",
    "the target was imaged close to the aimpoint , on the backside - illuminated chip s3 of the acis - s array .",
    "we cross - correlated the resulting source lists using a correlation radius of 3@xmath19 and we extracted a catalogue of common sources for each pair of observations . in view of the density of sources in each image ,",
    "the possibility of a chance alignement of two false detections is @xmath20 . as a further step",
    ", we selected sources within @xmath21 of the aimpoint since the telescope point spread function deteriorates as a function of offaxis angle , hampering source localization accuracy ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such an exercise yielded 12 common sources ( 2011 vs. 2009a ) , 10 sources ( 2011 vs. 2009b ) and 16 sources ( 2009a vs. 2009b ) , in addition to the target pulsar .",
    "the uncertainty on the source localization on each image depends on the signal to noise as well as on the offaxis angle and ranges from @xmath22 to @xmath23 pixel per coordinate .",
    "the positions of the selected , common sources ( excluding the pulsar counterpart ) were adopted as a reference grid to perform relative astrometry .",
    "we used the acis sky reference system ( pixel coordinates with axes aligned along right ascension and declination ) . taking into account the corresponding uncertainties , we computed the best geometric transformation needed to superimpose the reference frames of two images collected at different epochs .",
    "we superimposed the most recent 2011 data to first - epoch 2009a and ( separately ) 2009b data in order to measure the possible pulsar displacement over a baseline of @xmath24 yr .",
    "we also superimposed 2009a data to 2009b data ( no displacement is expected on a 1-day baseline ) in order to check for systematics affecting our analysis .",
    "a simple translation yielded a good superposition in all cases ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the frame registration turned out to be smaller than 50 mas per coordinate . adding a further free parameter to the transformation ( a rotation angle ) did not result in a statistically compelling improvement of the fit .",

    "the error budget for the overall pulsar displacement includes the uncertainty on the pulsar position in each image as well as the uncertainty on the multi - epoch frame registration .",
    "results are shown in table 1 .",
    "displacement of the pulsar as well as residuals on the positions of the reference sources after frame registration are also shown in figure 1 .",
    "a significant and consistent displacement of the pulsar is apparent both in the 2011 vs. 2009a and in the 2011 vs. 2009b comparison , while no displacement is seen for the pulsar in the 2009a vs. 2009b one .    by combining the two measurements , we obtain a pulsar proper motion @xmath33 mas yr@xmath3 and @xmath34 mas yr@xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to a total proper motion of 165@xmath3530 mas yr@xmath3 , translating to a ( projected ) space velocity of @xmath5d@xmath36 km s@xmath3 ( where d@xmath36 is the distance to the pulsar in units of 500 pc ) .",
    "the position angle of the proper motion is @xmath37 ( north to east ) ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the proper motion direction is very well aligned with the main axis of the nebula , which is indeed an `` x - ray trail '' .",
    "we observed the field of psr j0357 + 3205 in the h@xmath6 band on september 23 , 2012 with the gemini - north telescope on the mauna kea observatory .",
    "we used the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) in its imaging mode equipped with the interim upgrade e2v deep depletion ( dd ) detector , with enhanced response in the blue and red arm of the spectrum with respect to the original eev detector .",
    "the e2v dd detector is an array of three chips , with an unbinned pixel size of 0072 8 and covers an unvignetted field  of  view of @xmath38 .",
    "we used the ha_g0310 filter ( @xmath39 nm ; @xmath40 nm ) , centered on the h@xmath6 rest wavelength .",
    "the e2v dd detector was set in the @xmath41 binning mode and read through the standard slow read - out / low gain mode with the six amplifiers .",
    "observations were performed with an average airmass of 1.24 , image quality of @xmath42 , and grey time .",
    "two sets of six 500 s exposures were obtained , for a total integration time of 6000 s. exposures were dithered in steps of @xmath35 5 pixels to achieve a better signal  to  noise ( s / n ) .",
    "we processed the gmos images using the dedicated gmos image reduction package available in iraf .",
    "after downloading the closest bias and sky flat - field frames from the _ gemini _ science archive , we used the tasks gbias and giflat to process and combine the bias and flat - field frames , respectively .",
    "we then reduced the single science frames using the task gireduce for bias subtraction , overscan correction , image trimming and flat - field normalisation . from the reduced science images",
    ", we produced a mosaic of the three gmos chips using the task gmosaic and we used the task imcoadd to average - stack the reduced image mosaics and filter out cosmic ray hits .",
    "we computed the astrometry calibration using the _ wcstools _ suite of programs , matching the sky coordinates of stars selected from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite with their pixel coordinates computed by _",
    "sextractor _ @xcite .",
    "after iterating the matching process applying a @xmath43-clipping selection to filter out obvious mismatches , high - proper motion stars , and false detections , we obtained mean residuals of @xmath44 in the radial direction , using up to 30 bright , but non - saturated , 2mass stars .",
    "to this value we added in quadrature the uncertainty @xmath45 = 008 of the image registration on the 2mass reference frame .",
    "this is given by @xmath45=@xmath46 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath47 is the number of stars used to compute the astrometric solution , @xmath48=5 is the number of free parameters in the sky  to  image transformation model , @xmath49 is the mean absolute position error of 2mass @xcite for stars in the magnitude range @xmath50 . after accounting for the 0015 uncertainty on the link of 2mass to the international celestial reference frame @xcite , we evaluated with the overall accuracy on our absolute astrometry to be of @xmath51022 .",
    "unfortunately , no observations of spectro - photometric standards stars were available for the flux calibration of our h@xmath6 image .",
    "thus , we cross - correlated instrumental magnitudes of more than 150 non - saturated stars in the gemini image to their r@xmath52 magnitudes listed in the guide star catalogue v2.3.2 ( gsc2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which yielded a rather good fit with a r.m.s .",
    "of 0.16 mag . to assess the gsc2 flux zeropoint ,",
    "we cross - correlated the gsc2 @xmath53 magnitude of more than 500 stars with their r magnitude as tabulated in the stetson standard photometric star archive .",
    "we evaluated the transformation as @xmath53=0.97r-0.32 ( @xmath54 , 520 d.o.f . ) .",
    "then , we computed the h@xmath6 fluxes of the 150 selected stars on our gemini image using specific fluxes corresponding to their @xmath53 magnitudes and assuming a flat spectrum within the r filter bandpass .",
    "this yielded a flux calibration of the h@xmath6 image with an uncertainty of @xmath55 mag .",
    "no structures of diffuse emission unambiguously related to the fast motion of psr j0357 + 3205 can be discerned on our gemini image  in particular , no arc - shaped `` bow - shock '' nebula is seen at the expected position in the direction of the pulsar proper motion ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "we measured the background properties in the region surrounding the pulsar position .",
    "considering a region of 10 square arcsec as a reference and taking into account the uncertainty in the flux calibration of our h@xmath6 image , we computed the @xmath56 upper limit to the surface brightness of an unseen bow - shock nebula to be of @xmath57 erg @xmath58 s@xmath3 arcsec@xmath59 .",
    "relative astrometry on our multi - epoch _ chandra _ images unveiled a significant proper motion of @xmath60 mas yr@xmath3 for psr j0357 + 3205 , corresponding to a velocity of @xmath5d@xmath36 km s@xmath3 , along a direction almost coincident with the main axis of the elongated x - ray nebula .",
    "our result points to a direct link between the nebula morphology ( and physics ) and the space velocity of the pulsar ",
    "supersonic for any reasonable condition of the interstellar medium ( typical values are of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 km s@xmath3 for the cold , warm and hot components , respectively , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as already mentioned , `` velocity - driven '' pulsar wind nebulae are a well - known astrophysical reality .",
    "could the x - ray trail of psr j0357 + 3205 be explained as a bow - shock pwn ? as discussed by @xcite , the lack of any evidence of the pulsar wind termination shock could be due to its confusion with the pulsar emission . assuming a velocity of 390d@xmath36 km s@xmath3 and no inclination with respect to the plane of the sky , the expected angular separation between the pulsar and the forward and backward termination shock is @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively @xcite , where @xmath66 is the density of the interstellar medium in units of 1 particle cm@xmath3 .",
    "thus , high inclination of the pulsar velocity and/or high density of the ism , and/or a distance larger than expected should be assumed ; any of these hypotheses could be possible ( though rather unlikely ) . in any case",
    ", other peculiarities of the trail phenomenology can not be accounted for in the standard scenario of synchrotron emission from shocked pulsar wind .",
    "one should explain why the maximum luminosity is generated at a distance as large as @xmath68 light years from the parent neutron star .",
    "this would require an increase of the density of the radiating particles on the same distance scale ( possibly due to deceleration of the bulk flow ? ) , or an increase of the magnetic field intensity , or a change of the angle between the magnetic field and the particle flow .",
    "moreover , the lack of any spectral steepening across the trail @xcite clashes with the expected , severe synchrotron energy losses of particles radiating in the kev range .",
    "thus , either some very peculiar phenomenon is occurring in the magnetized pulsar particle outflow ( local particle re - acceleration ?",
    "large - scale organization of the flow magnetic field ? ) or the nature of the nebula is different ( but linked to the pulsar velocity ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite propose that the trail could be due to thermal emission by the ism heated by the shock driven by the fast moving pulsar .",
    "the measure of the pulsar space velocity can be used , together with the upper limit to the surface brightness of any undetected diffuse structure in our gemini h@xmath6 image , to constrain the conditions of the medium in which psr j0357 + 3205 is moving .",
    "the expected flux of the narrow - line component of a pulsar h@xmath6 bow - shock nebula depends on the pulsar spin - down luminosity @xmath69 , the pulsar space velocity v@xmath70 , the distance to the source d@xmath70 , and the neutral fraction of the medium x@xmath71 . using the scaling law proposed by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we estimated that for any reasonable value of the distance to psr j0357 + 3205 ( ranging from @xmath72 pc , as suggested by the non negligible x - ray absorbing column , to @xmath73 pc , where @xmath0-ray luminosity would exceed the spin - down luminosity ) and in a broad range of possible space velocities for the pulsar ( assumining the inclination angle with respect to the plane of the sky in the @xmath74 range ) , the lack of detection of a h@xmath75 nebula can only be ascribed to a neutral fraction x@xmath760.01 , i.e. the gas surrounding the pulsar is fully ionized .",
    "thus , psr j0357 + 3205 could be traveling across a region filled with ism in the hot phase .",
    "some contribution to the ionization of the medium from the pulsar itself is also possible , although its thermal emission is not particularly prominent @xcite .",
    "psr j0357 + 3205 is located well away from the galactic plane ( b@xmath77 ) . in view of this , it is interesting to note that the direction of the pulsar proper motion is almost parallel to the galactic plane ( it has an inclination of @xmath78 towards the plane ) .",
    "as done in @xcite , we used the proper motion information to extrapolate back in time the trajectory of the pulsar in the galactic potential to find possible associations with open clusters and ob associations @xcite , leaving the pulsar radial velocity as a free parameter and assuming a distance of 500 pc and an age of 0.54 myr .",
    "however , we found no association with clusters or ob associations closer than @xmath79 kpc . in any case , such an exercise showed us that if psr j0357 + 3205 has a radial velocity of order 600 km s@xmath3 ( or greater ) in the direction away from the solar system , the pulsar could have been born on the galactic plane ( assuming a scale height of 60 pc , typical for massive stars , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the hypothesis of a runaway high - mass star as the progenitor of psr j0357 + 3205 , suggested by @xcite , is not required in a range of possible orbital solutions .",
    "the radio - quiet psr j0357 + 3205 is traveling very fast ( @xmath5 km s@xmath3 ) into a fully ionized interstellar medium .",
    "its proper motion is perfectly aligned with its very elongated x - ray nebula , pointing to a physical link between the nebula and the space velocity of the neutron star .",
    "however , the standard scenario of a bow - shock synchrotron - emitting nebula does not explain the phenomenology of our target .",
    "deep radio polarization images could help explain the nature of this pwn , by tracing the underlying large - scale magnetic field configuration . unveiling a population of energetic , nearby pulsars missed by radio surveys , the _ fermi _ mission is opening new avenues to detect unusual pwne which could point to different ways to deposit pulsar rotational energy into the interstellar medium .",
