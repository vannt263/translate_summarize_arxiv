    "galaxy morphology has been a cornerstone of extragalactic research even before the discovery of the extragalactic nature of the nebulae ( e.g. , parsons 1850 )",
    ". detailed morphological classification of galaxies , in the modern sense dates to the work of hubble ( 1936 ) , who established the now classic tuning - fork diagram for galaxy morphology .",
    "since then there have been a number of modifications of this basic classification scheme .",
    "sandage ( 1961 ) described the sequence in substantially more detail than did hubble ( 1936 ) .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) presents a scheme that accounts for inner ring and spiral structure , as well as strong ( sb ) and weak ( sab ) bar classes . a later version ( de vaucouleurs",
    ", de vaucouleurs & corwin 1976 ) introduces the numerical `` t - type '' coding for morphology .",
    "this scheme is described in its most modern form in de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter rc3 ) .",
    "van den bergh ( 1976 and references therein ) introduced the ddo luminosity classification scheme that relates the surface brightness and the appearance of spiral arms with the absolute luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1982 ) created a classification scheme for the degree of structure seen in the spiral arms of galaxies , ranging from flocculent ( arm class 0 ) to grand design ( arm class 12 ) .",
    "buta ( 1986 ) and buta ( 1995 ) added a much more detailed classification scheme for resonance rings following the general precepts of de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) .",
    "the most significant departure from the basic hubble scheme is that proposed by morgan ( 1958 ) , and given in its final form by morgan , kayser & white ( 1975 ) .",
    "this scheme is essentially a one - dimensional classification based on the degree of concentration of light , with a secondary ` form ' parameter to distinguish amongst gross galaxy types .    a common property , and ,",
    "therefore , a common weakness of all these schemes has been the nearly exclusive use of @xmath2-band plate material for galaxy classification ( although see zwicky 1955 and schweizer 1976 for early work on multiwavelength morphology ) .",
    "this constrains existing classification schemes in two major ways .",
    "first , as classification has been done primarily in the @xmath2-band , it is very sensitive to the distribution of blue stars and dust .",
    "this is particularly unfortunate for the study of late - type galaxies , as the distribution of the young , blue stars and the dust can be very different from the distribution of the total baryonic mass .",
    "second , although well - exposed plates , taken under good seeing conditions , can offer excellent spatial resolution , plates are poor photometric detectors , and have a very limited dynamic range .",
    "thus , for instance , it is possible to miss features such as nuclear bars in classification plates that are deeply exposed in order to reveal the structure of spiral arms in the outer disk ( see eskridge et al .",
    "2000 for a discussion of this effect ) .",
    "the advent of two - dimensional near - infrared ( near - ir ) detectors has resulted in numerous efforts ( e.g. , hackwell & schweizer 1983 ; thronson et al .",
    "1989 ; block & wainscoat 1991 ; block et al .",
    "1994 ; block & puerari 1999 ) to compare galaxy morphology in the optical and near - ir .",
    "these studies revealed that there can be substantial differences between the optical and near - ir morphologies of spiral galaxies .",
    "indeed , block & puerari ( 1999 ) assert that there is no correlation between the optical and near - ir classifications of spirals .",
    "the main problem with these studies is that they deal with single galaxies , or at most , small samples of objects .",
    "in fact , the lack of a large , well - defined sample of multiwavelength digital imaging of spirals prompted the creation of the osu survey .",
    "we believe that classification in both the optical and near - ir , of a large , statistically complete sample of spirals is an important step in our understanding of the physical morphology of galaxies as a function of wavelength .",
    "the astrophysical motivation for such a comparison is that very different sorts of stars dominate the emission from spiral galaxies at optical ( @xmath2-band ) and near - ir wavelengths . in the optical , the regions of current massive star - formation , typically associated with the spiral arms",
    "will dominate .",
    "further , the absorbing effect of interstellar dust is substantial in the optical , and this material is also typically concentrated along the spiral arms . in the near - ir ,",
    "the flux is dominated by light from old giants .",
    "there can be significant contributions from young supergiants , but this effect appears to be small in all but the most extreme situations ( rhoads 1998 ) .    a number of recent studies have attempted to classify galaxies in some sort of automated way ( e.g. , abraham et al .  1994 ; odewahn et al .  1996 ; naim , ratnatunga & griffiths 1997 ;",
    "odewahn et al .",
    "such efforts , while promising , have mainly been devoted to classification at the very simplest level ; determining if a given extended object is a pure spheroid , a disky system , or peculiar .",
    "there have been pioneering efforts aimed at objective bar and spiral structure classification ( e.g. , abraham et al .",
    "1999 ; odewahn et al .",
    "2002 ) , and such efforts have largely been directed at studying high - redshift galaxy samples . this is appropriate as such samples are very large ( thousands of objects ) , and each galaxy is typically only a few resolution elements in diameter . detailed classification of well - resolved galaxies is still the provenance of `` expert classifiers '' . a landmark study of the classification biases of different `` expert classifiers '' ( naim et al .",
    "1995 ) reveals that different classifiers are in general agreement with one another , but typically have a scatter of about one t - type . whether this is good or bad agreement is , of course , a subjective decision .",
    "we believe it is good enough , given the underlying purpose of morphological classification .",
    "although descriptive classification is not physical , it is an essential starting point for a physical classification scheme : morphology is akin to species taxonomy .",
    "species taxonomy is not genetics , but it is an essential guide to asking relevant questions in genetics ( e.g. , mayr 1942 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey sample ; a large , statistically well - defined sample of bright nearby spiral galaxies . while previous multi - object samples ( most notably that of frei et al .",
    "1996 ) have been a great boon for many sorts of projects , none of these samples cover a wavelength range from the optical through the near - ir , and are both large and selected according to a well - defined set of criteria .",
    "we hope that the availability of the osu survey data will be of use to the community . in  2 we describe the survey selection and data taking procedure .",
    "we present statistical results of the comparison of the @xmath2- and @xmath1-band morphologies of the sample in  3 , and give notes on the @xmath1-band morphologies in  4 . in  5 we discuss some implications of our results , and suggest promising areas for future research .",
    "the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey comprises deep , photometrically calibrated @xmath0 images of 205 spiral galaxies selected from the rc3 according to the following criteria : @xmath5 ; @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ( due to the pointing limits of the ctio 1.5 m and perkins 1.8 m reflectors ) .",
    "we have been unable to obtain near - ir data for twelve galaxies from the defined sample that are south of @xmath9 ( we have optical data for six of these galaxies ) .",
    "figure 1 shows histograms of rc3 t - types for all galaxies in the rc3 with @xmath6 and rc3 ellipticity @xmath10 ( solid histogram ) , and for the osu sample as defined above ( dotted histogram ) .",
    "it is clear from this figure that our diameter and declination cut - offs do not impose any morphological selection bias on the osu survey .",
    "we obtained the data for the survey in a large number of observing runs with six different telescopes of apertures between 0.9 m and 2.4 m , in both hemispheres in the period from 1993 through 2000 .",
    "the @xmath11 data were obtained mainly with the 1.8 m perkins reflector of the lowell observatory , and the ctio 1.5 m , with some additional data from the 2.4 m hiltner telescope of the mdm observatory .",
    "we used osiris ( depoy et al .",
    "1993 ) at the 1.8 m and the 1.5 m .",
    "we also used cirim ( http://www.ctio.noao.edu/instruments/ir_instruments/cirim/cirim.html ) at the 1.5 m .",
    "the data from the 2.4 m were taken with tifkam ( pogge et al .",
    "the @xmath12 data were obtained mainly with the 1.8 m perkins reflector and the ctio 0.9 m , with additional data from the usno 1.1 m hall telescope of the lowell observatory , the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope of the mdm observatory , and the ctio 1.5 m .",
    "a large number of imaging cameras and detectors were used to obtain the @xmath12 imaging .    for the nir imaging ,",
    "our typical observing strategy was as follows : we would obtain a series of short ( 1 to 20 sec ) observations with no read - out or dither ( a stack ) .",
    "we would then read out the stack , dither the telescope , and take another stack .",
    "we would then chop by a distance comparable to the field of view , and take a similar set of dithered sky observations .",
    "the total on - source integration time per galaxy in @xmath13 and @xmath1 are typically 10 to 15 minutes . in @xmath14",
    "we observed somewhat longer , generally between 20 and 30 minutes .",
    "for the optical imaging , our typical strategy was to obtain 3 images per filter , with total integration times of 20 - 30 minutes in @xmath2 , 10 - 15 minutes in @xmath15 , and 5 - 10 minutes in @xmath16 .",
    "as we had many nights of observing time that were non - photometric , we adopted a strategy of obtaining deep images on non - photometric nights , and using photometric nights to obtain short integrations ( `` snapshots '' ) of large numbers of galaxies to calibrate our deep images .",
    "our data are unavoidably heterogeneous , having been obtained at many telescopes , with many different instruments , by many different observers , and under a wide range of sky conditions .",
    "however , the approximate limiting surface brightnesses of typical survey data are @xmath17 magnitudes per square arcsecond and @xmath18 magnitudes per square arcsecond .",
    "information about the osu survey is available at http://www.astronomy.ohio - state.edu/@xmath4survey/. with the acceptance of this paper for publication , we shall make the uncalibrated @xmath2 and @xmath1 images available as an _ early data release _ at http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/@xmath4survey/edr/index.html .",
    "we plan on making the entire calibrated @xmath0 data set publicly available when we are satisfied with the photometric calibration .",
    "anyone who is interested in using data that have not been publicly released yet is encouraged to contact one of the first three authors .",
    "in table 1 we present the sample .",
    "column 1 gives the ngc , ic , eso or anon designations of the galaxies in the sample . in columns 2 and 3",
    "we give the morphological types from the rc3 , and the carnegie atlas of galaxies ( sandage & bedke 1994 , hereafter referred to as cag ) .",
    "columns 4 and 5 present our @xmath2- and @xmath1-band classifications .",
    "our @xmath2-band classification follows the precepts laid out in the rc3 and cag , and is generally closer to those of the rc3 .",
    "our @xmath1-band classification follows these same general precepts , but with a number of differences driven by the nature of the @xmath1-band morphology of spirals .",
    "the classic prescription for the classification of spirals involves three observables : the bulge to disk ratio ; the pitch angle of the spiral arms ; the degree of resolution ( or knottiness ) of the arms . for two of these three observables , there is a clear bias toward an earlier classification from near - ir images . in near - ir images ,",
    "the bulge is more prominent , and the spiral arms are less knotty than they appear in optical images .",
    "it is not obvious that the pitch angle of the spiral arms should change systematically from the optical to the near - ir .",
    "block & puerari ( 1999 ) find substantially different pitch angles in optical and near - ir images of a small sample of spirals , but they do not see evidence for any systematic trend . as the degree of resolution in the arms of even very late type galaxies is substantially lower in the @xmath1-band than in the optical , the essential features in determining the @xmath1-band hubble stage are the bulge to disk ratio , and the pitch angle of the spiral arms .",
    "as we discussed in  1 , the optical and near - ir emission from spirals is dominated by different populations of stars , and subject to different levels of dust absorption .",
    "thus structures that are dominated by older stellar populations should be more prominent in the near - ir than the optical .",
    "this has the consequence that the bar fraction in the near - ir is significantly higher than it is in the @xmath2-band ( eskridge et al .",
    "it should also cause the observed bulge to disk ratio to be higher in the near - ir than in the optical .",
    "this should tend to drive near - ir morphological classification to earlier types .",
    "structures that are dominated by either younger stellar populations , or by absorption effects will be less prominent in the near - ir than the optical .",
    "flocculent spiral features , either dominated by ob stars or by dust lanes , may disappear in the near - ir , again leading to earlier morphological classification .",
    "also features such as resonance rings that are currently lit up by star formation may be less prominent or unseen in the near - ir ( see the images of ngc 6782 on the survey web - page for an example ) .",
    "grand design spiral patterns are seen in near - ir imaging of many spirals ( e.g. , puerari et al .",
    "2000 ) , thus spiral patterns are not traced out by only the young stars .",
    "in fact , there is evidence from the study of a small sample that there can be drastic differences in the pitch angle of the spiral pattern measured in the optical and the near - ir ( block & puerari 1999 ) . the assertion of block & puerari ( 1999 ) that the optical and near - ir morphologies of spiral galaxies are uncorrelated begs for a comparative study of the optical and near - ir morphological types of a large unbiased sample of spirals such as ours .",
    "one of us ( pbe ) classified the entire sample in both @xmath2 and @xmath1 twice , with excellent overall agreement between the trials in each waveband : more than 80% of the classifications agreed to within two subtypes ( i.e. , sa to sb ) .",
    "we also cross - checked our results by comparing classifications done by two of us ( pbe & jaf ) .",
    "we selected forty galaxies from the sample in @xmath2 , and forty in @xmath1 , and compared our classifications for these subsets .",
    "for both the @xmath2 and @xmath1-band subsets , more than 80% of the tested galaxies were assigned types that again agreed to within two subtypes . in no case",
    "were there any systematic differences between any of our sets of classifications .",
    "this compares well with the scatter between classifiers reported by naim et al .",
    "figure 2 shows comparisons of classifications , parameterized as t - types , following the rc3 .",
    "we compare the optical classifications of the rc3 and the cag to one another , and both of these catalog classifications with our optical and near - ir classifications .",
    "table 2 gives the average and median differences and dispersions as a function of hubble type for each of the classification pairs shown in figure 2 .",
    "we note that we are presently interested in hubble stage and bar family classification only .",
    "although we note the presence of inner ( r ) and outer ( r ) ring structures when they are obvious , we otherwise feel unqualified to make variety - classifications ( rs and s types ) as defined by de vaucouleurs ( 1959 ) , or detailed ring morphology classifications as defined by buta ( 1986 ; 1995 ) .",
    "figure 2a and table 2a show a good agreement between the rc3 and the cag for types sab through sc ( @xmath19 ) . for galaxies with rc3 types s0/a and sa ,",
    "the cag gives slightly later classifications .",
    "it is well known that the cag classifies very few galaxies as later than sc , thus the disagreement with the rc3 at late types is expected .",
    "figure 2b and table 2b show our osu @xmath2-band types against the rc3 types .",
    "overall , the agreement is excellent .",
    "we tend to classify galaxies with rc3 types s0/a and sa ( @xmath20 ) as having marginally later type , and galaxies with rc3 types later than sc ( @xmath21 ) as having marginally earlier types . however , our optical classifications agree with the rc3 to within the dispersion for all types s0/a through sm . in figure 2c and table 2c",
    "we compare our @xmath2-band types with the cag . for galaxies with cag types of s0/a through sc ( @xmath22 )",
    "our optical types match even better than with the rc3 .",
    "the disagreement at later types is consistent with what is seen in fig .",
    "2a .    in figure 2d and table 2d",
    ", we compare our @xmath1-band types with the rc3 types . for the earliest ( s0/a and sa , or @xmath20 ) and latest ( scd through sm or @xmath23 ) types",
    ", the agreement is excellent .",
    "but for galaxies with rc3 types from sab through sc ( @xmath19 ) , our @xmath1-band types are roughly one sub - class earlier than the rc3 types on average .",
    "while this is within the dispersion for any given type , the effect is persistent across the range of mid - type spirals .",
    "we compare our @xmath1-band types with the cag in figure 2e and table 2e .",
    "our @xmath1-band classifications are earlier on average by about one subclass from cag types s0/a through sbc ( @xmath24 ) . at sc ( @xmath25 )",
    ", we are in rough agreement , and there are too few galaxies with cag types later than sc for any meaningful comparison .",
    "finally , in figure 2f and table 2f , we compare our @xmath2-band classifications with our @xmath1-band classifications .",
    "for all osu @xmath2-band types sa through scd ( @xmath26 ) , we assign @xmath1-band types that are roughly one subclass earlier than the optical types . at the very earliest ( s0/a ) and latest ( sd through sm ) types , our @xmath2-band classifications agree with our @xmath1-band classifications on average .    in summary , we find that spiral galaxies with optical classifications of roughly sab through sc ( @xmath19 ) appear about one t - type earlier in the @xmath1-band on average .",
    "this result persists for all optical classifications ( rc3 , cag , and our own ) . and",
    "the disagreement between optical and near - ir classes occurs in the range of morphological types over which all optical classifications are in good agreement . for the earliest ( s0/a and sa ) and latest ( scd through sm ) types ,",
    "there is no wavelength dependence in the morphological classification . while there have been a number of studies comparing galaxy morphology in the optical and near - ir ( see  1 ) , these have mainly been studies of individual galaxies , or at most small samples .",
    "ours is the first result showing the nature of the morphological k - correction ( the change in morphology as a function of observed rest - wavelength)for a large , statistically complete sample of spirals .",
    "thus it is worth considering possible physical reasons for our results .",
    "for the earliest types ( s0/a and sa ) , there is no disagreement in the mean between the optical and near - ir classifications .",
    "as these galaxies have very little ongoing star - formation , and very little dust , both the optical and near - ir morphologies are dominated by the distribution of old , late - type stars .",
    "the two wavebands should give similar classifications , and we are reassured that they , in fact , do so .",
    "we find an average disagreement of one subclass between the optical and near - ir classifications of mid - type spirals ( optical classifications sab through sc ) , in the sense that the near - ir classifications tend to be earlier than the optical classifications .",
    "as noted above , bulges are more prominent and spiral arms are less knotty in the near - ir than in the optical .",
    "this drives the earlier classification of mid - type spirals in the near - ir .",
    "we see no disagreement in the mean for the latest type galaxies ( scd through sm ) .",
    "these are galaxies that are dominated by on - going star formation , so this seems surprizing at first .",
    "however , very late - type galaxies have poorly defined spiral structure , and very weak or non - existent bulges as matters of definition .",
    "the things that work to drive the sort of morphological k - correction we see for the mid - type spirals are the relative prevalence of the bulge , and the difference in contrast and appearance of spiral arms traced by sites of on - going star formation ( in the optical ) or by the distribution of old , late - type giants ( in the near - ir ) .",
    "galaxies with no bulge , and very poorly defined spiral patterns will not look substantially different in the near - ir than in the optical , and will thus be classified essentially the same on average .",
    "below , we provide brief descriptions of the @xmath1-band morphology of each survey galaxy , along with our @xmath1-band morphological classifications . for galaxies with osu@xmath2 types more than two sub - types different ( earlier in all cases ) than their osu@xmath1 types",
    ", we discuss the features that drive the earlier classification in the @xmath1-band .",
    "table 3 gives a set of @xmath1-band type examples for each morphological class .",
    "we show @xmath2- and @xmath1-band images of these type examples in figure 3 . the images in fig .",
    "3 are typically shown in an 8-bit logarithmic stretch with white set at 2@xmath27 below the sky level , and black at the peak value .",
    "we adjusted this in cases with bright nuclear sources . in figure 4",
    ", we show color - composite images ( blue is @xmath2 , green is @xmath16 , red is @xmath1 ) of six galaxies .",
    "we selected two early - type , two mid - type , and two late - type spirals to show in figure 4 . within each pair",
    ", we selected one object that is given the same classification in the optical and near - ir , and one that is classified at least a full hubble type earlier in the near - ir than in the @xmath2-band .",

    "we have begun such a program for a few of the galaxies in the osu survey ( eskridge et al .",
    "2001 ) , however , the small field of the of the wfpc2 on hst has restricted this work to the smallest systems in the survey .",
    "the coming availability of the wider - field advanced camera for surveys will allow us to extend the observations to a much larger fraction of the survey galaxies .",

    "the study of galaxy morphology has been a crucial tool for our understanding of the universe for the last 80 years .",
    "we are now entering an era when the early qualitative , single wave - band approach to morphology is maturing into a quantitative , multi - wavelength discipline .",

    "<S> we announce the initial release of data from the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey , a @xmath0 imaging survey of a well - defined sample of 205 bright , nearby spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we present @xmath1-band morphological classification on the hubble sequence for the osu survey sample . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the @xmath1-band classification to @xmath2-band classification from our own images and from standard galaxy catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath2-band classifications match well with those of the standard catalogs . on average , galaxies with optical classifications from sa through scd appear about one t - type earlier in the @xmath1-band than in the @xmath2-band , but with large scatter . </S>",
    "<S> this result does not support recent claims made in the literature that the optical and near - ir morphologies of spiral galaxies are uncorrelated . </S>",
    "<S> we present detailed descriptions of the @xmath1-band morphologies of our entire sample , as well as @xmath2- and @xmath1-band images for a set of 17 galaxies chosen as type examples , and @xmath3 color - composite images of six galaxies chosen to demonstrate the range in morphological variation as a function of wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> data from the survey are accessible at http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/@xmath4survey/ </S>"
