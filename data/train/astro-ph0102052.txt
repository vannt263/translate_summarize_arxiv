    "optical and near infrared interferometers , by virtue of their long baselines , can achieve angular resolutions better than is possible with a single telescope .",
    "however , the atmosphere imposes serious limits on interferometer sensitivity , via the coherence length ( @xmath6 ) and coherence time ( @xmath7 ) : the length and time scale over which atmospheric effects change significantly . at optical and near infrared wavelengths ,",
    "atmospheric phase variations are dominated by the temperature / density fluctuations of the dry air component .",
    "conversely , interferometric observations can yield detailed information on atmospheric turbulence on spatial scales larger than those of single apertures . in order to operate ,",
    "interferometers need to measure ( and correct ) both delay and angle fluctuations .",
    "the time series of these measurements gives temporal and spatial information on atmospheric turbulence .",
    "the correlations in delay fluctuations over a finite baseline length can potentially provide additional information .",
    "we used the palomar testbed interferometer ( pti ) @xcite for atmospheric measurements .",
    "pti has three siderostats ( only two of which can be used at one time ) .",
    "it can operate at wavelengths of  1.6 and  @xmath0 , with simultaneous operation possible .",
    "all the data reported in this paper were taken on a 110  m baseline ( oriented @xmath8 east of north ) , at a wavelength of @xmath0 ( 2.02.4  @xmath9 passband ) .",
    "although the interferometer has a dual star mode ( for narrow angle astrometry ) , only data from single star mode was used in this analysis .",
    "there were multiple motivations for this study .",
    "the first was to better understand the physics of atmospheric refractivity fluctuations .",
    "the second was to quantify the atmospheric error in astronomical measurements ( especially those with an interferometer ) , and perhaps devise improved observational strategies .",
    "the third motivation was to look for instrumental error sources , by searching for deviations from an atmospheric signature .",
    "during pti operation , the position of the optical delay line , relative to a standard fiducial point , is monitored by laser metrology , recorded at 500  hz , and averaged in post processing to match the white - light sample time of 10  or 20  msec .",
    "the delay line follows a predicted sidereal trajectory .",
    "a correction is supplied by the output of the fringe tracker , which adjusts the delay with a 510  hz closed - loop bandwidth to follow the white - light fringe in the presence of atmospheric turbulence and imperfect baseline and astrometric knowledge .",
    "the fringe phase is measured for each 10  or 20  msec sample in a broadband , `` white - light '' channel , as well as in each of  5 spectral channels across the band .",
    "the white - light phase , which has a high snr per sample , represents the error of the fringe tracker ; by adding the white light phase ( scaled to delay units ) to the measured delay line position , we obtain the total delay at 10  or 20  msec intervals .",
    "the white - light phase measurements are all modulo-@xmath10 radians ; phase unwrapping maintains continuity during tracking , but undetected unwrapping errors can occur due to low snr or rapid atmospheric motion . these are nominally detected and corrected ( one cycle at a time ) at a lower rate , of order 1  hz , using group delay measurement from the phases measured across the 5  spectral channels @xcite .",
    "while the group delay provides an absolute measurement , the low correction rate means that some fraction of the data can be off the central white - light fringe , with the fraction growing for poor seeing .",
    "we used four selection criteria to minimize such ` cycle slips . '",
    "first , sources with fringes weaker than a threshold value were excluded .",
    "second , only scans with an average of @xmath11 detected fringe lock breaks per 24  s output record were used .",
    "this criterion biased our results , by excluding approximately one third of the total data : nights ( and segments of nights ) with noisy atmospheric conditions .",
    "however , it was necessary in order to avoid contamination from instrumental effects .",
    "third , whenever group delay measurements indicated a cycle slip in the fringe tracking , 0.5  s of data at that epoch were flagged and not used in the analysis .",
    "fourth , sources brighter than a threshold value were not used .",
    "fringe data is recorded when locked on the white - light fringe , as ascertained by the fringe signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "bright sources could be tracked on sidelobes of the central fringe with the current implementation of fringe centering .      during interferometer operations ,",
    "the angle of each starlight beam was sensed ( relative to the optical axis on the beam combiner table ) every 10  msec .",
    "this `` error signal '' was used to drive a fast steering mirror , with a closed loop bandwidth of 5  hz . the fast steering mirror ( fsm ) position was desaturated into the siderostat positions with a bandwidth of @xmath12  hz .",
    "the three component signal complicated the use of the star tracker data for atmospheric measurements .",
    "fortunately , the atmospheric timescales of interest were shorter than the timescale for desaturation of the fsms .",
    "it was not feasible to add the error signal to the fsm positions . with the quad - cell sensor used for angle tracking ,",
    "the gain is a function of the seeing - dependent spot size . while not an issue for a conservative closed - loop system , this does prevent accurate combination of the error with the mirror position to get angle variations at all frequencies",
    "therefore , we used the fsm positions by themselves , with separate analysis of the error signals in order to set limits on short timescale angle variations .",
    "we used star tracker data only during periods when fringes were being tracked ( _ i.e. _ the time gaps in the fringe white light files were used as a flag to edit out similar time periods in the star tracker data ) .",
    "the time series of delay ( and phase ) measurements contained large ( tens of meters ) geometric components , in addition to atmospheric components . to remove the geometric component , we subtracted a least squares sidereal fit from all the data on a source on a given night : @xmath13 here , st represents sidereal time . by solving for three parameters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) , our residuals were insensitive to uncertainties in the length or orientation of the interferometer baseline , or to the zero point in the delay line metrology .    in order to avoid removing significant short term ( @xmath17  s ) atmospheric signature from our data in the fitting process",
    ", we only used sources with multiple scans on the same night .",
    "the time span for the sidereal fit was therefore always @xmath18  s. numerical tests showed that a sidereal fit over a duration @xmath19 caused a noticeable suppression in the structure function of the residuals on time scales as short as @xmath20 , with larger effects on longer timescales .      using the residual ( _ i.e. _ post sidereal fit )",
    "delay / phase time series , structure functions @xmath21 were calculated : @xmath22 ^ 2\\right>\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the residual delay at time @xmath24 , and the @xmath25 brackets denote ensemble averaging . with observations scheduled for amplitude visibility measurements ( the majority of our data ) , the scan lengths were typically 130  s. one structure function was calculated for each scan . on some nights , long scans ( 2030  min . ) were made , solely for atmospheric measurements . for those scans ,",
    "structure functions were calculated for each 3  minute segment of data .",
    "a typical delay structure function is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "on timescales from 50  msec to @xmath26  s , a clean power law slope was seen in the structure function of nearly every ( @xmath27% ) scan . on the shortest timescales ( @xmath28  msec ) ,",
    "the structure function for many scans exhibited power above that extrapolated from the slope at longer ( 50500  msec ) timescales .",
    "we interpret this excess power as being due to instrumental effects ( _ e.g _ vibrations ) .",
    "on timescales longer than @xmath26  s , the slope of @xmath29 decreased , due to some combination of outer scale length and baseline crossing effects ( _ i.e. _ the product of wind speed and time interval becomes comparable to or greater than the baseline length ) .",
    "the long baseline ( 110  m ) of pti , compared to that of other optical / ir interferometers , has a longer wind speed crossing time .",
    "there is therefore a relatively long time interval ( @xmath30  s ) over which the fluctuations at the two siderostats are uncorrelated . as discussed later ,",
    "outer scale effects were more important than the effect of a finite baseline length , at least for the four nights on which we recorded star tracker data from both siderostats , and were able to measure the outer scale length .",
    "an alternate method of quantifying fluctuation statistics is power spectral density .",
    "structure functions have the advantage of being unaffected by gaps in the data , and allow a more direct calculation of the dependence of seeing on wavelength , or astrometric precision on baseline length and integration time .",
    "the comparison between power spectral density and structure functions is discussed in section  [ outerscale ] .",
    "a least squares fit to the slope of @xmath29 was made for each scan , over the interval 50500  msec ( 10  msec integration mode ) or 60600  msec ( 20  msec integration mode ) .",
    "equal weight was given to each logarithmic time interval in the fit .",
    "results from a given scan were not used if the rms residual to the fit was @xmath31 in log - log space , or there was too little data ( time span @xmath17  s or @xmath32% of the data from the span missing ) .",
    "scans with large residuals did not exhibit a simple power law turbulence spectru . as a result ,",
    "these scans could not be accurately characterized by a single power law index , and we chose not to use them in further analysis .",
    "the two parameters from the fit were the slope and intercept .",
    "we wished to derive the coherence time @xmath33 , defined as the time interval over which the interferometer phase fluctuations have a variance of @xmath34 .",
    "our notation follows that in @xcite ; the `` 2 '' refers to the contributions from the two apertures of the interferometer .",
    "the variance @xmath35 of delay over a time interval @xmath36 is @xcite : @xmath37 if @xmath38 , @xmath39 if @xmath40 is expressed in @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42^{1/\\beta}\\ ] ] we can convert from our measured two aperture variance coherence times @xmath43 at @xmath0 to one aperture difference times @xmath44 at @xmath45 , as measured in adaptive - optics applications . setting @xmath46 , we get @xmath47^{1/\\beta}t_{0,2\\ ( 2.2\\ \\mu{\\rm m})}\\ ] ]    our data were taken over a range of zenith angles ( za ) , up to @xmath48 .",
    "the value of @xmath29 at short time scales for a vertical column of uniform turbulence is expected ( on theoretical grounds ) to vary linearly with the thickness of the column , suggesting that @xmath29 will be proportional to @xmath49 . however ,",
    "if the wind velocity is not perpendicular to the source azimuth , the dependence will be more gradual",
    ".    the extreme range of the variation in @xmath33 from zenith angle variations will be ( see eq.[4 ] ) a factor of @xmath50 . for the values of @xmath51 measured at pti ( @xmath52 ) , this will be @xmath53 . as shown in section  [ results ] , the range of coherence time was much larger than this , even within one night .",
    "therefore , only a small part of the observed variation in @xmath33 can be due to the range in observed sky directions .",
    "the fitted slope should not depend on zenith angle , based on theoretical grounds .",
    "we see no dependence in our data .",
    "light from the siderostats is brought into the optics lab via evacuated beam tubes . within the optics lab ,",
    "the delay lines operate in air .",
    "a `` building within a building '' design @xcite helps to keep this air still and nearly isothermal .",
    "a test of the fluctuations within the optics lab , including the long delay lines , gave a delay structure function 1000  times smaller than those on natural stars ( m. swain , private communication ) .",
    "we conclude that refractivity fluctuations within our instrument gave a negligible contribution to our derived atmospheric parameters .",
    "the time series of starlight arrival angle measurements @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in directions @xmath56 and @xmath57 , were used to derive angular structure functions , @xmath58 and @xmath59 : @xmath60 ^ 2\\right>\\ ] ] separate structure functions were calculated for the fast steering mirror positions and for the error ( _ i.e. _ residual ) values .",
    "typical fsm angular structure functions are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath59 rise rapidly and then flatten out .",
    "the upturn at the longest time scales ( @xmath62  s ) is due to the desaturation of the fsms into the siderostats .",
    "the structure functions for the star tracker error signals showed a sharp rise up to a constant `` plateau '' for all the scans .",
    "this plateau was reached at a time scale of 2050  msec , depending on the scan . on time scales",
    "longer than @xmath63  msec ( full range 1825  msec ) , the structure functions of the fsm positions were larger than the structure functions of the error signals .",
    "therefore , the fsm angular structure functions ( _ e.g. _ figure  [ fig2 ] ) represent all of the actual angle fluctuations , except for a small amplitude , rapid component .",
    "we modeled the measured angles as a least squares fit for the wavefront slope across our apertures , in two ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) directions @xcite . for the @xmath56-axis slope ,",
    "we want to minimize @xmath65 ^ 2dr\\ ] ] here @xmath66 is the radius ( 20  cm ) of our aperture , and @xmath67 is the delay at position @xmath68 and time @xmath24 on the aperture . setting @xmath69 , we obtain @xmath70 the definition of @xmath61 gives @xmath71 equation(7 ) leads to : @xmath72 the analog to equation(8 ) for the spatial delay structure function @xmath73 is : @xmath74 @xmath75 is assumed to be independent of @xmath76 and @xmath24 , so that this term integrates to zero .",
    "@xmath77 with a similar derivation for @xmath78 , we get @xmath79dr'\\ ] ] @xmath80 we relate the spatial and temporal structure of the turbulence field with the frozen flow ( taylor ) approximation . for sky directions near zenith ( as in our observations ) , the dependence of model @xmath61 and @xmath59 values on wind azimuth is relatively minor : @xmath81% in amplitude and the timescale of the slope break , compared to the values for a @xmath82 azimuth .",
    "we therefore used an azimuth of @xmath82 in the calculations .",
    "the close agreement between the measured @xmath61 and @xmath59 curves suggests that the true wind azimuth was not near @xmath83 or @xmath84 ( or , more likely , that there was a mix of wind azimuths in the turbulent region of the atmosphere ) .      once @xmath21 is specified , the only free parameter in modeling @xmath61 is the wind velocity , needed to relate the coherence time ( @xmath33 ) to the coherence length ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath21 to @xmath73 . for a wind velocity of @xmath85 in azimuth @xmath86 , @xmath87 a grid of model wind velocities",
    "was used to test the agreement between theoretical and measured angular structure functions . in general , the agreement for a single turbulent flow velocity was poor  the slope change in the model was sharper than in the data .",
    "therefore , models with multiple layers ( bulk wind velocities ) were used .",
    "the turbulence fields in different layers were assumed to be independent , so that their contributions to the angular and delay structure functions could be added .",
    "figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] show the agreement between data and model for single and double layer models , for a scan on 1999 , night 109 .",
    "adding even more layers to our models would have resulted in slightly better matches to the shapes of the measured structure functions than in figure  4 .",
    "however , it would not have changed the overall scaling mismatch .",
    "there was not enough information in the angular structure functions to closely constrain the velocity of each component , but the general shape of the overall velocity distribution was determined .",
    "the overall amplitude scale for the fsm angles is uncertain by at least 20% , enough to account for the discrepancy between data and model seen in figures  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ( note that the structure function is proportional to the _ square _ of the angles ) .",
    "in addition , the model values reflect the average of the conditions at the two siderostats .",
    "delay data ( which passed the selection criteria described above ) were obtained for 64 nights in 1999 .",
    "table  1 gives a summary of the data volume : number of scans and total time span for each night , along with the mean values of the slope ( @xmath51 ) and coherence time ( @xmath33 ) . for long scans ,",
    "each 3  minute segment has been counted in the total in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the mean fitted spectral slopes for the nights with @xmath88 usable scans .",
    "the vertical bars represent the @xmath89 scatter about the mean for that night .",
    "the three dimensional kolmogorov value of 5/3 is shown for comparison .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] is a scatter plot of the mean slope and coherence time for each night with @xmath88 usable scans .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] is a similar plot for all the data , with one point per scan .",
    "there appears to be no obvious correlation between the slope and coherence time .",
    "the lower cutoff at @xmath90  msec is a selection effect : for shorter coherence times , there were too many losses of lock to meet our selection criteria ( or the atmosphere was too noisy for the interferometer to operate at all ) .",
    "the variations in @xmath51 and @xmath33 within individual nights did not fit into any obvious pattern .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the variations for nights 62 , 223 , and 257 in 1999 ( this includes the two nights with the largest number of scans , and the two nights with the largest time spans ) . for most nights",
    ", there was no obvious trend in @xmath51 with time .",
    "the coherence time varied by factors of  24 , sometimes on timescales of @xmath91  hr ( _ e.g. _ on night  62 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with reports of variations in seeing on similar time scales ( _ e.g. _ martin et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "an exponent of @xmath51 in the delay structure function corresponds to an exponent of @xmath92 in the one - dimensional spectrum of delay fluctuations ( armstrong & sramek 1982 ) . for a kolmogorov spectrum ,",
    "the power spectrum exponent is @xmath93 .",
    "there were only four nights with extensive data recorded from both north and south star trackers .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] gives the results of the velocity fitting for those nights .",
    "the time variations in the weights of the fitted wind velocities were small ( @xmath94% ) within each night .",
    "the weights in table  2 represent the relative contributions to the coherence time ( _ i.e. _ delay variations ) . to get the contribution of component @xmath95 to the coherence length",
    ", these weights should be scaled by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the velocity of component @xmath95 and @xmath51 is the measured slope of the delay structure function ( see table  1 ) .",
    "therefore , the contributions of low velocity ( @xmath98 ) turbulent flow to @xmath6 are more dominant than suggested by the weights in table  2 .      if we assume that delay variations are due to a turbulence field convected past the telescopes ( frozen flow ) , variations in @xmath33 could be due either to variations in the flow velocity or to variations in the properties of the turbulence field .",
    "variations in the measured flow velocity ( described above ) within individual nights were small .",
    "therefore , variations in @xmath33 must primarily reflect variations in the turbulence field . as a measure of the total fluctuation amplitude ,",
    "we used @xmath99 : the delay structure function at a time interval of 50  s. this interval is approximately half the length of our shortest scans , and is therefore approximately the longest interval over which we can get good statistics for @xmath29 in one scan . by an interval of 50  s , @xmath29 had nearly leveled off for most scans .    for those scans ( on nights 109 , 211 , 212 , and 271 ) with star tracker data , we can use @xmath99 to solve for an outer scale size of the turbulence . for @xmath38 and a set of velocities @xmath97 with weights ( fractional contribution to @xmath29 ) @xmath100",
    ", the structure function will saturate at a value : @xmath101\\ ] ] here @xmath102 is the structure function definition of the outer scale length : the spatial delay structure function @xmath103 reaches a maximum value of @xmath104 .",
    "the derived outer scale values , for each scan with dual ( north and south ) angle tracking data , are shown in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "the decision to record dual star tracker data on these four nights was not based on the level of measured turbulence .",
    "we therefore expect the results shown in figure  9 to be representative of the conditions during the full set of 64 nights listed in table  1 .",
    "however , these results may not apply to the nights where the coherence time was too short for us to extract atmospheric parameters .",
    "we have no constraints on the outer scale length for those ` noisy ' nights .",
    "an outer scale length in the refractivity power spectral density is generally represented with the von karman model ( ishimaru 1978 ) : @xmath105^{-11/6}\\ ] ] the spatial frequency @xmath106 , with @xmath107 the wavelength of the fluctuation . for the generalization to non - kolmogorov slopes ,",

    "our measured power law slopes for short time scale delay variations were largely in the range 1.401.50 , and were in all cases shallower than the three - dimensional kolmogorov value of 5/3 . the spectral slope was not correlated with the coherence time , at least when atmospheric conditions were stable enough for operation of the interferometer .",
    "the kolmogorov spectrum is based on dimensional considerations @xcite .",
    "measurements of strong turbulence in a variety of fluids have shown good agreement to kolmogorov spectra @xcite .",
    "however , atmospheric conditions during astronomical observations involve much weaker turbulence .",

    "wilson , on baselines from 3  to 31  m in length . based on power spectral densities",
    ", they found a mean slope slightly shallower than kolmogorov , by 0.12 ( equivalent to a slope of 1.55 for delay structure functions ) .",
    "@xcite also used data from mt .",
    "however , all their short time scale measurements were made with a laser distance interferometer , over a horizontal path of length @xmath94  m , located 3  m above the ground .",

    "<S> data from the palomar testbed interferometer , with a baseline length of 110  m and an observing wavelength of @xmath0 , were used to derive information on atmospheric turbulence on 64 nights in 1999 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured two - aperture variance coherence times at @xmath0 ranged from 25  msec to 415  msec ( the lower value was set by instrumental limitations  </S>",
    "<S> the interferometer could not operate when the coherence time was lower than this ) . on all nights </S>",
    "<S> , the spectrum of the short time scale ( @xmath1  msec ) delay fluctuations had a shallower spectrum than the theoretical kolmogorov value of 5/3 . on most nights , </S>",
    "<S> the mean value of the power law slope was between 1.40 and 1.50 . </S>",
    "<S> such a sub - kolmogorov slope will result in the seeing improving as the @xmath2 power of wavelength , rather than the slower @xmath3 power predicted by kolmogorov theory .    </S>",
    "<S> on four nights , the combination of delay and angle tracking measurements allowed a derivation of the ( multiple ) wind velocities of the turbulent layers , for a frozen - flow model . </S>",
    "<S> the derived wind velocities were all @xmath4 , except for a small @xmath5 component on one night .    </S>",
    "<S> the combination of measured coherence time , turbulence spectral slope , and wind velocity for the turbulent layer(s ) allowed a robust solution for the outer scale size ( beyond which the fluctuations do not increase ) . on the four nights with angle tracking data , the outer scale varied from 6  to 54  m , with most values in the 1025  m range . </S>",
    "<S> such small outer scale values cause some components of visibility and astrometric errors to average down rapidly . </S>"
