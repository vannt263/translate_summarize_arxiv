    "this paper considers dynamical gluon mass generation in a pure - glue d=3 non - abelian gauge theory ( nagt ) , based on the pinch technique ( pt ) . recall that the pt algorithm was introduced @xcite to generate gauge - invariant green s functions in non - abelian gauge theories such as an nagt , and was later extended in d=4 to an algorithm for green s functions both gauge - invariant and renormalization - group invariant ( rgi ) @xcite .",
    "of course , the gluon mass is not a pole mass , or we would see gluons in experiments ; it is more in the nature of a screening mass , analogous to the polaron of condensed matter physics  an electron or hole made heavy by coupling to the ionic background . in an nagt the gluon couples to a background of other virtual gluons .",
    "we give a precise definition to the mass concept , defining a zero - momentum mass @xmath3 by @xmath10 ( throughout this paper , hatted quantities are pt quantities . )",
    "we similarly define a landau - gauge mass by @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the scalar function for the pt gluon propagator and similarly for landau gauge .",
    "the pt mass is the zero - momentum value of a running mass @xmath13 that vanishes like @xmath14 at large momentum ; see sec .",
    "[ mix ] . for technical reasons , in d=3 it is much simpler to ignore the running of the mass , which we do throughout this paper .",
    "clearly this definition of mass makes sense only if the right - hand side of eqns .",
    "( [ massdef],[landmass ] ) is finite and positive . as we discuss at the end of this section all lattice simulations in the landau gauge show that this is indeed true . in sec .",
    "[ landau ] we invoke a background - quantum identity showing that the zero - momentum landau - gauge propagator @xmath15 is a finite and positive multiple @xmath16 of @xmath17 : @xmath18 and so @xmath19 . since @xmath20 , these two masses are different .",
    "this is to be expected , since the landau - gauge propagator is gauge - dependent and unphysical ; the pt mass as defined in eq .",
    "( [ massdef ] ) is gauge - invariant . by estimating @xmath21 and using the estimate of @xmath22 from the present work we find a fortuitously close agreement between our resulting approximate value of @xmath22 and the landau - gauge mass inferred from simulations .",
    "or conversely we may take the simulation value @xmath23 and infer @xmath3 , again with fortuitously good agreement , considerably better than the 20 - 25% error that we are probably making in our approximate formulation",
    ".    one might think that d=3 mass generation should be an easier problem than in d=4 , where renormalization is required .",
    "in contrast , a d=3 nagt is superrenormalizable , so that at infinite momentum the gluon coupling @xmath24 does not change from its value in the classical action .",
    "nevertheless , we can define a running coupling @xmath25 without reference to a renormalization group and this running has important consequences for the gluon mass in d=3 .    a number of theoretical works on the gluon mass in d=3 date from the nineties @xcite .",
    "these gave reasonable results for the gluon mass , but a closer analysis @xcite of the theoretical gluon propagators seemed to be disappointing and unphysical for a reason that was not really appreciated at the time : non - positivity of the propagator spectral function .",
    "this is manifested by a bulge in the euclidean propagator , clearly evident in landau - gauge lattice simulations .",
    "non - positivity is a consequence of d=3 infrared slavery , inherited from the",
    " wrong \" sign of d=4 asymptotic freedom ( af ) .    aside from the works referenced above ,",
    "there is also a decade - later work @xcite using a special form of the pt and oriented to later landau - gauge lattice data .",
    "the general approach is similar to what is used here , including the addition of massless scalars to the 3-gluon vertex @xcite .",
    "the massless scalar fields are essentially nambu - goldstone ( ng ) excitations , and must exist as bound states if the gluon mass is to be gauge - invariant with no elementary higgs fields . using free vertices and free massive input propagators ,",
    "the authors find important non - positivity in the output propagator",
    ". however , there are significant differences from the present work in the treatment of mixing the massless scalars with gluons and of determination of the gluon mass .",
    "moreover , there is no discussion of the effects of non - positivity on the 3-gluon vertex , which we estimate to be considerable and in the direction of cancelling non - positivity effects in the propagator when used in the gluon - mass gap equation .",
    "@xcite and other later works benefited from good lattice data on the landau - gauge propagator@xcite that we will recap in sec .",
    "the lattice evidence for dynamical generation of some sort of gluon mass is unequivocal in d=3 : the landau - gauge inverse propagator is not zero at zero momentum , but finite and positive ( see fig .  [ maasfig ] in the next section ) . in d=4",
    "there is also an abundance of lattice work that confirms gluon mass generation .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "moreover , much is being done in continuum studies of the d=4 problem , mostly by papavassiliou and collaborators ( for a discussion of work up to 2011 , see @xcite ; later work can be traced from , for example , @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we argue that in the homogeneous bethe - salpeter ( b - s ) equation governing the value of the dynamical mass , this positivity problem is largely ameliorated by a compensating dip in the 3-gluon vertex , so that the predicted gluon mass value is much less affected by non - positivity than the propagator itself is .",
    "that there must be a dip in the vertex that ( partially ) compensates the propagator bulge follows from the qed - like ward identity ( see sec",
    ".  [ vp1 ] ) relating them .",
    "approximations not accounting for both the propagator bulge and the vertex dip can give gluons mass values far removed from reality .",
    "for this reason , it is particularly important that the ward identity be satisfied , even in the face of approximations .",
    "the vertex paradigm that we use here is based on constructing an approximate vertex from which the propagator is extracted using the ward identity .",
    "much of the present work is devoted to the study of this complicated non - linear problem .",
    "we can find an explicit feynman - parameter integral for the approximate vertex at one dressed loop , and it is easy to find the corresponding propagator from the ward identity .    evaluating the many terms of this feynman - parameter integral to find the vertex itself is a daunting task , never done even for the one - loop perturbative vertex .",
    "even if it were evaluated precisely , it is an approximation that is not necessarily highly accurate .",
    "consequently , we resort to other approximations based on d=5,6 scalar field theories to capture the essence of how the ward identity relates a propagator bulge to a vertex dip @xcite .",
    "these are useful because @xmath26 is asymptotically - free and its d=5 descendant behaves much like a d=3 nagt ; they are reviewed in appendix [ vpapp ] .",
    "the models are tweaked so that their one - dressed - loop schwinger - dyson equations ( sde ) resemble those of an nagt as much as possible , and to this end some of the fields are endowed with an abelian charge and corresponding vertex with its ward identity .",
    "it is uncomplicated to carry out the vertex paradigm construction for these scalar field theories , and the results for the propagator are surprisingly close to previous approximations to nagts @xcite .",
    "the vertex paradigm was previously used in d=4 for truncating the pt schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "it begins with analytic tree - level approximations to the full pt inverse propagator and 3-gluon pt vertex ( the inputs ) that are massive and therefore free of ir singularities .",
    "if the masses do not run , these inputs exactly satisfy the ghost - free qed - like ward identity relating them .",
    "this is a critical point in showing that a one - dressed - loop output approximation to the 3-gluon vertex using these input green s functions satisfies the ward identity .",
    "we then simply apply the ward identity to find the output gluon propagator .",
    "there are a number of technical obstacles to overcome , in particular the treatment of bound - state massless scalar excitations , akin to ng fields , that are necessary if the gluon has mass .",
    "we give a road map of the vertex paradigm in the appendices , and more details are found in @xcite . in principle , the output green s functions can be recycled and used as input functions for another round , but nothing is known about what happens in this second stage .    in reality , the output gluon mass is a running mass , depending on momentum @xcite in both d=3 and d=4 .",
    "the author does not know how to guarantee the ward identity with a momentum - dependent input mass , but it is much easier , although not trivial , if the mass does not run . in d=4 using a constant mass prevents us from actually finding a value for the mass , which must vanish at infinite momentum for the gluon - mass gap equation to be uv - finite .",
    "( if a truly constant bare mass led to a uv - finite solution of the gap equation , then an nagt with a mass term would be renormalizable in d=4 . )",
    "but in d=3 we can still solve the gap equation with a constant mass .",
    "the error made in this approximation is small , since the uv region contributes little to the gap equation .",
    "ultimately , this is inconsistent , because in d=3 a constant mass input to the gap equation automatically leads to an output mass that runs to zero as @xmath14 at large momentum .",
    "an identically - vanishing mass is not a solution to the gap equation , which becomes ir - singular in this limit .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we carry out the vertex paradigm in euclidean space with the usual euclidean metric .",
    "we reserve a study of the properties of the dynamical mass in minkowski space , where it is surely not a pole mass , for the future .",
    "section [ crit ] brings up the critical properties , related to infrared confinement , that are the central themes of this paper . in section [ vp1 ]",
    "we introduce the vertex paradigm and the ward identity , and discuss the massless scalar poles necessary for gauge - invariant gluon mass generation .",
    "section [ step1 ] is a straightforward transcription of earlier d=4 efforts in the vertex paradigm to construct the d=3 pole - free vertex .",
    "section [ mix ] constructs the homogeneous b - s equation whose solution is the running mass .",
    "section [ step3 ] and appendix [ vpapp ] introduce an approximation to the output 3-gluon vertex , based on ir confinement analogs found in ir confining scalar theories in d=5,6 .",
    "this section also proposes , for heuristic purposes , a d=3 running charge that is just another name for part of the 3-gluon vertex , similar to what has been done in d=4 @xcite .",
    "section [ landau ] estimates the function @xmath27 that determines the ratio between the landau - gauge lattice propagator @xmath28 and the pt propagator @xmath29 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath27 allows us to compare the lattice - gauge landau propagator to the pt propagator , and in particular the gluon masses ( defined from the inverse propagators at zero momentum ) .",
    "the landau - gauge mass @xmath23 need not , and does not , agree with the pt mass @xmath3 .",
    "section [ conc ] has a summary and conclusions , and appendices a , b , c elaborate on the vertex paradigm , scalar theories in d=5,6 , and a useful regulator for certain divergent integrals , respectively .",
    "some properties that complicate the gluon mass problem hold in both the pt green s functions and in the landau - gauge lattice gluon propagator , and in both d=3 and d=4 .",
    "the green s functions have the properties that :    1 .",
    "the inverse propagator has zero - mass scalar poles , akin to nambu - goldstone poles .",
    "these are required by gauge invariance if the proper self - energy does not vanish at zero momentum",
    ". this non - vanishing is equivalent to a dynamical gluon mass , although not a simple pole mass .",
    "these ng poles can not appear in physical quantities .",
    "2 .   the propagator ,",
    "although it obeys a spectral representation , does not have a strictly non - negative spectral function .",
    "this is the positivity problem .",
    "it is a d=3 avatar of af .",
    "3 .   the pt 3-gluon vertex has features related to the pt propagator non - positivity through the qed - like ward identity connecting them .    in an @xmath30 gauge the inverse of the pt propagator",
    "has the form : @xmath31 where the transverse projector is @xmath32 the pt proper self - energy @xmath33 is independent of the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath34 , whose coefficient in the propagator receives no physical corrections .",
    "we omit writing this gauge - fixing term in the following equations .      from eq .",
    "( [ loopprop ] ) one sees that the first critical property , the ng - like poles , arises as long as @xmath35 .",
    "this is equivalent to dynamical mass generation , which is signaled by an inverse propagator that is finite and positive at zero momentum . through the qed - like ward identity relating the 3-gluon pt vertex to the inverse pt propagator",
    ", these ng - like poles have to be in the vertex , but these poles get projected out in landau - gauge lattice studies .",
    "the second critical property shows up in the lattice data cited above , most of it in landau gauge , with clear evidence both of non - positivity in the propagator spectral function .",
    "the first property , a gluon mass , is evident for the landau gauge in figure [ maasfig ] , showing the d=3 gluon propagator in the landau gauge @xcite .",
    "the d=3 landau - gauge gluon propagator ( @xmath36 ; lower curve ) as a function of momentum @xmath37 for various lattice sizes .",
    "the filled circles are at the largest lattice size of 18 @xmath38 .",
    "( the gluon dressing function in the upper graph is @xmath39 times the lower curve.),width=384 ]      the second critical property is that the spectral function is negative in some regions .",
    "the scalar function @xmath29 has the spectral representation @xmath40 the same basic representation holds in , for example , the landau gauge , but unlike the spectral representation for conventional gauge - dependent propagators , in the pt case there are no unphysical and gauge - dependent threshholds , such as would apply to ghosts , and @xmath41 is strictly positive .",
    "if the spectral function is nowhere negative , it is apparent that the derivative with respect to @xmath37 of the propagator can nowhere be positive , and equally apparent that this condition is violated in figure [ maasfig ] .",
    "the filled circles , data for the largest lattice , as well as data for smaller lattices , clearly show that the gluon propagator has a positive slope at zero momentum , which equally clearly shows that positivity is violated .",
    "the positivity violation in d=4 is not obvious just from a casual glance at the propagator .",
    "a little closer look shows that there is indeed non - positivity in d=4 , but not as pronounced as for d=3 .",
    "see , for example , fig .  1 of @xcite",
    ", comparing the two cases . in both d=3 and d=4 the cause of the bulge is  wrong \" signs coming from ir confinement .    finding the spectral",
    "function itself from lattice data is not straightforward , because only data in the euclidean region are available and it is difficult to reconstruct the spectral function accurately just from knowledge of the propagator in this regime . for a brief review of these issues with references to original work , see @xcite .",
    "the source of the bulge in d=3,4 is the ir confinement ",

    "is replaced by 11 ; this suggests the degree to which the landau - gauge and the pt propagator differ , although both have the same so - called  wrong \" sign .",
    "it is this sign in this inverse propagator that gives rise to an unphysical tachyonic pole in the perturbative pt propagator at a euclidean momentum @xmath45 .",
    "this tachyon will be killed by a mass term and by massive internal gluon propagators , provided that the mass is large enough . but",
    "removing the tachyon is not enough ; it leaves its mark behind in the propagator bulge of fig .",
    "[ maasfig ] that unambiguously reveals the non - positivity problem .",
    "this means that the output propagator does not resemble a free massive propagator such as in eq .",
    "( [ treeprop ] ) below except in the extreme ir and uv .",
    "there are no lattice data that are useful in understanding the pt 3-gluon vertex , but this vertex has critical properties in the gluon gap equation . the ward identity of eq.([qedlike ] ) below , relating the divergence of the 3-gluon green s function to the inverse pt propagator , suggests that the positivity - violation bulge in the propagator is mitigated in dressed - loop graphs by an offsetting dip in the vertex . in the gap equation",
    "this can lead to substantial cancellation of non - positivity effects between vertex and propagator .",
    "this is a difficult issue to explore , since the output 3-gluon vertex of the vertex paradigm is so complicated , and has  wrong \"-",
    "sign problems of its own that could lead to unphysical tachyons .",
    "at the moment we can only address it heuristically and approximately .",
    "one element is to exploit af in the scalar theory @xmath26 , having strong analogs to d=4 nagts , and its avatar in @xmath46 , analogous to a d=3 nagt @xcite .",
    "in particular , the propagator bulge can be well - modeled , and it is related to a 3-gluon vertex form factor by a qed - like ward identity , just as in an nagt .",
    "this suggests that our model for the form factor is also useful , since it is from this form factor and the ward identity that the propagator is derived .    in d=4 ,",
    "the 3-gluon form factor of interest is closely related to the usual running charge , which rises from the uv and saturates in the ir .",
    "we hope to make plausible here that in d=3 there is also a running charge @xmath47 with the same properties , defined not through a renormalization group but through the pt 3-gluon vertex of the nagt and the ward identity relating it to the pt propagator .",
    "see appendix [ d3runch ] for a few details .",
    "because the renormalization group is not involved , this charge is defined in d=3 as well as in d=4 ( where it agrees , through two loops , with the usual running charge in the uv ) .",
    "we define the running charge by one of the 3-gluon vertex scalar form factors with one momentum set to zero @xcite ; let us call this @xmath48 .",
    "the running charge @xmath25 is related to the form factor by eq .",
    "( [ runchnum2 ] ) , repeated here for convenience .",
    "@xmath49 in the tweaked analog models we identify this form factor with the primary form factor of the abelian current introduced above .    in the ir",
    "it is not possible to define a running charge uniquely , in d=3 or in d=4 .",
    "but our definition is physically plausible , and has useful properties .",
    "for example , we will take it that the squared running charge is , as its name suggest , positive .",
    "moreover , our definition in d=3 yields a running charge largest at zero momentum and monotonically decreasing toward the uv , where it approaches the fixed lagrangian coupling @xmath24 at infinite momentum .",
    "the consequent properties for @xmath48 imply a vertex - function dip that tends to offset the non - positivity bulge in the gluon propagator .",
    "the final result is co - existence of the non - positivity bulge in the pt ( or landau gauge ) propagator with a gluon mass that is consistent both with the gap equation and with landau - gauge lattice data .",
    "we give here only an outline of the technically - tedious steps in the one - loop vertex paradigm .",
    "appendix [ review ] gives a very brief summary , and details are in @xcite .",
    "the main point of the vertex paradigm , a truncation of the pt sdes , is to construct successive approximations to the pt gluon proper self - energy and to the pt 3-gluon vertex , following pt principles for constructing gauge - invariant green s functions , that    1 .",
    "satisfy the qed - like ( ghost - free ) ward identities of the pt 2 .",

    "there is a strong connection between these green s functions from the ward identity relating them .",
    "there are several obstacles to implementing the vertex paradigm :    1 .",
    "not every approximation to a 3-vertex will satisfy the ward identity ( see eq .",
    "( [ qedlike ] ) below ) structurally , that is , have a divergence that actually is the difference of two identical functions with different momenta as arguments . 2 .",
    "a gluon mass requires poles in the inverse propagator and so , by the ward identity of eq .",
    "( [ qedlike ] ) , also in the 3-vertex . but",
    "no such poles occur in a one - loop vertex constructed with simple input propagators and vertices .",
    "the method of successive approximations may show signs of non - convergence .",
    "the vertex paradigm @xcite can handle the first two problems .",
    "we devote much of this paper to formulating a semi - quantitative solution to the last problem , which arises because of non - positivity .",
    "the trouble is that in d=3 the one - loop output propagator does not at all resemble the input propagator .    in the pt ,",
    "ward identities are qed - like , with no ghost contributions .",
    "for example , the ward identity relating the pt 3-gluon vertex @xmath50 to the pt inverse propagator is : @xmath51 although this is a ghost - free and gauge - independent relation , the right - hand side is not a difference of inverse propagators ( except in a ghost - free gauge ) . if @xmath52 is not zero , there are poles in the right - hand side , and therefore such poles also exist in the vertex .    in the vertex paradigm ,",
    "the vertex in the ward identity is a sum of two pieces .",
    "the first vertex part is a simple feynman integral and it does not have the poles required by the ward identity to yield the poles of the massive inverse propagator in eq .",
    "( [ loopprop ] ) .",
    "so we add ( see sec .",
    "[ vertform ] ) a second vertex part @xcite , called @xmath53 , which is the product of regular factors times terms with massless longitudinally - coupled ng - like scalar excitations .",
    "it satisfies its own ward identity that gives precisely the pole parts of the inverse propagator .",
    "we emphasize that these ng - like excitations do not imply symmetry breaking in dynamical gluon mass generation for an nagt .    if we knew the vertex we could find the inverse propagator from the ward identity .",
    "this seems like a circular statement since one needs the propagator to find the vertex .",
    "we try to avoid this circularity by using successive approximations , starting with a reasonable tree - level form for input propagators and vertices in one - dressed - loop graphs .",
    "the approximate output vertex is just the integral over the input propagator and vertices .",
    "then the ward identity gives the output inverse propagator .",
    "the hope is that this process of successive approximations will eventually converge .",
    "an earlier truncation method , called the gauge technique and explained in @xcite , attempts the inverse problem : given the propagator , find the vertex .",
    "this is a much easier problem with an algebraic solution ( see @xcite and sec .  [ vertform ] ) , but it is not very accurate .",
    "it leads to sdes written entirely in terms of the propagator .",

    "this one - loop vertex is quite complex and has never been evaluated fully , even in perturbation theory .",
    "fortunately , its graphical construction makes it straightforward to verify the ward identity from the momentum - space integrand of the one - loop vertex , without actually doing any integrals , and it is then easy to evaluate the vertex paradigm pt proper self - energy .    in order to use the mass gap equation",
    "we need a semi - quantitative approximation to this complicated output vertex .",
    "the vertex has some properties that are general consequences of ir confinement and a qed - ward identity , so we will model these properties in one - loop graphs of @xmath46 ( see appendix [ vpapp ] ) .",
    "this can be at best semi - quantitatively correct , but it serves to make the point about how non - positivity is subdued by cancellations between the product of propagator and vertex occurring in the mass - gap equation .",

    "conversely , using lattice data and the scale factor , but not the gap equation , leads to a pt mass parameter estimate of @xmath125 = 2.41 , as compared to the pt estimate of 2.48 .",
    "the closeness of the comparisons is undoubtedly fortuitous .",
    "the following is a road map , not a complete exposition .",
    "the main point is to suggest how to organize matters so that the ng - like massless poles are cancelled as much as possible before carrying out any serious calculations .",
    "this leads us to the pole - free vertex discussed in the main text .",
    "the first step is to construct a tree - level model that has gluon and ghost masses in it .",
    "the action is the usual nagt action plus a gauged non - linear sigma model mass term , plus gauge - fixing terms .",
    "pinching is greatly simplified in the feynman gauge , which we use for the gnls model . in this model",
    "the gluon propagator is @xmath152.\\ ] ] the last term @xmath153 , a difference of massless and massive scalar propagators , suggests that the massless ghosts are cancelled out and replaced by ghosts of mass @xmath3 , as in the feynman - fls gauge @xcite , and this is indeed what happens .",
    "some such replacement must occur in the pt .",
    "in general , the ghost mass is gauge - dependent , and since the pt propagator has only physical threshholds , the massless ghost poles get replaced by poles at @xmath22 , in much the same way as it happens in the pt for electroweak theory @xcite . or one may simply argue that the pt propagator can be constructed in a ghost - free gauge , because it is the same in any gauge .",
    "so for practical purposes we use the tree - level propagators of eq .",
    "( [ treeprop ] ) , repeated here for convenience , @xmath154 that have no massless poles .",
    "the second step is to follow @xcite and write down the sum of one - loop graphs that give the s - matrix element for the scattering of three external quarks .",
    "[ vertgraph ] shows these graphs .",
    "the one - loop s - matrix element for finding the pt 3-gluon vertex .",

    "e.g. _ , ( g ) , are not vertex parts , but they contain vertex parts that are extracted by using tree - level ward identities that pinch out the internal parts of quark lines .    satisfying the pt ward identity at one - loop level is a matter of satisfying it at tree level .",
    "the form quoted in the text ( eq .",
    "( [ qedlike ] ) , although ghost - free , is not really useful at tree level because of its massless poles . instead @xcite , we write the usual tree - level vertex as the sum of two parts : @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the bfm - feynman - gauge vertex .",
    "it has one line ( called the background line ) singled out ; say it is @xmath157 .",
    "the background lines are those attached directly to quark vertices in fig .",
    "[ vertgraph ] .",
    "the remaining part , @xmath158 , has only longitudinal terms @xmath159 that trigger pinch parts . on the @xmath157 line , @xmath156 satisfies a simple ward identity with no massless poles : @xmath160^{-1}- [ \\widehat{\\delta}^0_{ij}(p_3)]^{-1}.\\ ] ] it obeys this ward identity even for the massive propagator of eq .",
    "( [ treeprop ] ) , provided that the mass @xmath3 does not run with momentum and is the same for all gluons and ghosts .",
    "it certainly would not satisfy this identity for a running mass .",
    "this is the fundamental reason that we use the constant - mass approximation in the d=3 problem .",
    "satisfying the tree - level ward identity is 90% of the task of satisfying the one - loop ward identity with massive tree - level propagators ; for the one - loop massless perturbative vertex , it is 100% .",
    "the interested reader can study @xcite for the other 10% that arises from other complications , such the appearance of uncancelled @xmath22 in the numerator arising from the pinch process and dealing with seagull terms .",
    "we can get a qualitative , even semi - quantitative understanding of how the full vertex can help to tame the bulge in the propagator by turning to some higher - dimension theories having no spin complications because they refer to scalar fields .",
    "one of them , @xmath26 , has af analogous to that of d=4 nagts , and the other , @xmath162 scalar theory in d=5 , inherits certain  wrong - sign \" properties just as does a d=3 nagt . these higher - dimension scalar models are to be used only at the one - dressed - loop level , and with graphical coefficients adjusted to yield appropriate results for gauge theories in two fewer dimensions .",
    "taken seriously , the scalar theories do not exist because there is no stable vacuum , but that will not concern us here . just as for nagts , we do not allow a bare mass term , but radiative corrections induce a mass @xmath3 , assumed to be the same for all fields .",
    "there are two ways to remove the power - law divergences of the self - energies of these theories .",
    "one is a regulation scheme @xcite already used in d=3,4 .",
    "appendix [ regsec ] gives this scheme for higher dimensions .",
    "the other way is to calculate the self - energy from a ward identity , by introducing an abelian charge for two of the fields , and we will concentrate on that here .",
    "we use the corresponding abelian vertex to find a simple approximation to one of the scalar functions occurring in the pole - free vertex @xmath54 , as an integral over feynman parameters .",
    "this scalar function multiplies the born kinematics , and its prefactor is taken not as prescribed by the d=5 model , but from the requirement that the ward identity yields the correct one - loop propagator in perturbation theory , given in eq .",
    "( [ 1loop ] ) .",
    "as shown in earlier works @xcite , the asymptotically - free six - dimensional theory @xmath26 can be slightly modified to lead to a qualitatively - reasonable approximation for the one - dressed - loop 3-gluon vertex and gluon proper self - energy of a d=4 nagt .",
    "the modifications involve introducing an abelian charge for the scalars ( two of which carry equal and opposite charge ) and a corresponding one - loop current vertex , as well as supplying one - loop graphs  by hand \" with coefficients taken from the nagt .",
    "we call this model tweaked @xmath26 . the qed - like ward identity for the tweaked - model current vertex yields the @xmath82 proper self - energy , which turns out to be practically identical to what the vertex paradigm yields for d=4 nagts",
    ".    similarly , tweaked @xmath46 bears a close resemblance to a d=3 nagt , as one might expect because the trilinear coupling @xmath91 has mass dimension 1/2 in both theories .",
    "we introduce an abelian current and find a finite propagator from its ward identity . in d=6 , the ward identity reduces the self - energy divergence from the quadratic divergence of @xmath26 to the logarithmic one of nagts . in d=5 ,",

    "this is the case because : @xmath170=[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_2}-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_3 } ] [ d+m^2]\\ ] ] and the integrals over the @xmath171 give only end - point contributions that are of the needed functional form as in eq .",

    "another feature of the approximation is that the vertex integrand @xmath108 is correct for the equal - mass triangle graph in d=3 .",
    "the numerator , however , is not correct for d=3 nagts .",
    "a potential problem with the expression ( [ 5to3vertex1 ] ) is that it might have a zero in the euclidean region , if the mass is small enough .",
    "generally , such a zero leads to a tachyonic pole in the inverse propagator , from the ward identity ( [ gluewi ] ) , and there is no evidence for this pole in lattice data .",
    "such a coincident pole and vertex zero does not appear in the s - matrix .",
    "one way to remove the tachyon is to use a dispersion relation for a squared running charge , quite analogous to a dispersion relation used for a squared running charge proposed earlier @xcite in d=4 .",
    "this necessarily positive quantity is related , in d=4 , to the vertex form factor @xmath48 introduced above , which can not have any tachyon . of course ,",
    "any running charge in d=3 is not related to a beta - function or renormalization group ; the point is that it can be defined from a plausible interpretation of the ward identity .",
    "in d=4 there is another use for this abelian vertex that , at least qualitatively , links it to nagts .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the current - vertex form factor that multiplies the born kinematics yields a running charge defined at all momenta down to zero that agrees in the uv with the usual running charge based on the renormalization group for one and two loops .",
    "this running charge has the usual uv properties , and due to mass generation it is well - defined in the ir as well .",
    "it is a physically well - motivated function in the ir , but not unique . in d=4",
    "the renormalization group properties of pt green s functions suggest writing the pt propagator , multiplied by @xmath24 , @xmath178 provided that both the pt propagator and @xmath24 are renormalized at the same renormalization point , their product is renormalization - group - invariant @xcite . by definition",
    "each of the factors in ( [ hruneqn ] ) are also renormalization - group invariant .",
    "although @xmath29 is unique , its factorization is not . to be definite , in both d=3 and d=4 case we _ define _ @xmath179 as a standard massive propagator with a running mass : @xmath180 where the running mass is finite at zero momentum , and vanishes in perturbation theory .",
    "in d=4 perturbation theory this definition for @xmath181 in the uv is the usual running charge to two - loop order .",
    "all this has its analogs in d=3 , except for the fact that there is no renormalization group in this dimension . in d=3",
    "we write the pole - free propagator @xmath182 as @xmath183 ( omitted terms are irrelevant )",
    ". then simple manipulations of the pole - free ward identity ( [ gluewi ] ) with one vertex momentum set to zero express the so - defined running charge in the form of eq .",
    "( [ runchnum ] ) , repeated here for convenience .",
    "@xmath184 where @xmath105 is the scalar coefficient of the born term in the 3-gluon vertex .",
    "our introduction of the d=3 running charge is just another way of speaking of this vertex form factor , but we use it heuristically to argue that the vertex @xmath48 is everywhere positive in the euclidean region .",
    "if @xmath26 is a decent model of d=4 nagt , does @xmath46 resemble d=3 nagt , with the characteristic signs inherited from d=4 ? at first sight this seems impossible , since @xmath46 is not obviously a superrenormalizable theory ; it has linear uv divergences in the proper self - energy as calculated directly from a feynman graph .",
    "but because the 3-point abelian current vertex is finite the ward identity yields a finite proper self - energy .",
    "the regulator given here also yields a finite self - energy .",
    "in addition , one might worry that seagull graphs in d=3,5 are divergent .",
    "but our regulator @xcite gets rid of power - law divergences , as of course dimensional regularization also does , but the alternative regulator does not introduce ( as dimensional regularization does ) potential ir divergences by the introduction of terms with massless poles . this regulator was originally used in d=3,4 but it can be constructed for any dimension d@xmath1853 .",
    "the regulator rule is : @xmath186 this replacement is an identity when the integrals in question converge , and gets rid of power - law divergences when they do not .",
    "the effect of the regulator is to reduce divergent integrals by two space - time dimensions .",
    "it is an alternative to using the abelian current vertex to define the proper self - energy , but we do not pursue that subject further here .",
