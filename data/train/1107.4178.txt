    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulator ( ti ) realizes a novel quantum state of matter where a nontrivial @xmath5 topology of the wavefunction of the bulk valence band leads to the emergence of a  topological \" surface state consisting of helically spin - polarized dirac fermions.@xcite the peculiar spin texture of the surface state holds promise for novel spintronics and fault - tolerant topological quantum computing , so there is a rush of research to address this surface state.@xcite however , most of the known ti materials are poorly insulating in the bulk , making it difficult to probe the surface state by transport experiments .",
    "for example , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is considered to be a promising ti material because it has a relatively large ( @xmath60.3 ev ) bulk band gap and a nearly perfect dirac cone as its topological surface state;@xcite however , no matter whether it is in the form of bulk crystal,@xcite nanoribbon,@xcite or epitaxial thin film,@xcite bi@xmath0se@xmath1 always accompanies a lot of se vacancies ( usually @xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 ) that act as electron donors , and as a result , the residual bulk carriers hinder the transport studies of the surface state of this material .    to achieve a bulk - insulating state in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ,",
    "doping holes to compensate for the residual electrons is a viable strategy .",
    "while this was done through low - level substitution of ca@xmath9 for bi@xmath10,@xcite the resulting disorder was so strong that no shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillation from the surface state was observed@xcite in bi@xmath11ca@xmath12se@xmath1 .",
    "a different strategy was to partially substitute sb for bi , which apparently reduces the se vacancies ; indeed , with a relatively large ( @xmath612% ) sb substitution , surface sdh oscillations were successfully observed in @xmath3-type bi@xmath11sb@xmath12se@xmath1 , but a very high magnetic field ( @xmath660 t ) was required for the observation.@xcite it is to be noted that with the sb doping one can never cross the band gap to reach the @xmath2-type regime , and hence the tuning of the chemical potential to the dirac point is impossible .",
    "this is a pity , because bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is attractive for its isolation of the dirac point from the bulk bands .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to find a suitable @xmath2-type dopant to access the dirac point while keeping the mobility to be sufficiently high for the surface state to be studied by the sdh oscillations .    in this paper",
    ", we show that tactful defect engineering in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 employing cd doping in combination with se - vacancy tuning provides a useful means to control the chemical potential across the band gap . in the literature,@xcite whereas cd in bi@xmath0se@xmath1",

    "the single crystals of cd - doped bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were grown by using elemental shots of bi ( 99.9999% ) , cd ( 99.99% ) and se ( 99.999% ) as starting materials . to maximize the cd content in the crystal , excess cd and a mixture of bi and se with a ratio of bi : se",

    "the x - ray diffraction measurements confirmed the crystal to be single phase with the proper bi@xmath0se@xmath1 structure .",
    "the actual cd content was determined by the inductively - coupled plasma atomic - emission spectroscopy ( icp - aes ) to be 0.0020(2 ) .",

    "the surface layer of the annealed crystals were removed using adhesive tapes before transport measurements .",
    "it worth mentioning that in our annealing experiments , we took precautions to minimize the uncertainty in the annealing temperature . for each annealing run , we placed the quartz tube at the same position of the same furnace so that the temperature gradients in the furnace as well as the thermocouple calibration errors do not affect the annealing result . also , the environment temperature was kept constant during this experiment to minimize the temperature fluctuations between different annealing runs . as a result , the annealing temperature @xmath17 was very reproducible and its variation between different runs with nominally the same @xmath18 was within @xmath191 @xmath14c .",

    "one can see that @xmath20(@xmath35 ) evolves _ nonmonotonically _ with the annealing temperature , @xmath18 ; namely , @xmath20 initially increases with @xmath18 until @xmath18 exceeds 577 @xmath14c , after which @xmath20 decreases as @xmath18 is further increased .",

    "the observed change was quite reproducible , as demonstrated in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "figures 3(a)-3(d ) show the @xmath37 data for at least two samples annealed at the same temperature , where one can see that the behavior for each @xmath18 is essentially reproducible .",

    "actually , this variation in the behavior of @xmath27 indicates that the @xmath17 = 577 @xmath14c samples are at the verge of the @xmath2-to-@xmath3-type conversion .    figures 4(e)-4(h ) show the @xmath39 curves measured in sample  a \" of each @xmath18 .",

    "3(c ) ] together with the complex behaviors of the hall signal are likely to be a signature of a high level of compensation achieved in the samples annealed at 577 @xmath14c ; in other words , in those samples the acceptors and donors are nearly equal in number and their delicate balance can easily change the sign of @xmath21 . it is to be emphasized that our data demonstrate that this high level of compensation is reproducibly achieved with @xmath18 = 577 @xmath14c . in samples annealed at other temperatures ,",
    "the @xmath39 behavior is almost linear [ figs .",

    "the above observation that a drastic change in the transport properties of bi@xmath22cd@xmath23se@xmath1 occurs in a very narrow temperature window might seem surprising .",

    ", there are mainly two different types of charged defects , the aliovalent substitutional defect cd@xmath40 and the vacancy defect @xmath41,@xcite the former acts as an acceptor and the latter as a donor .",
    "therefore , the effective charge - carrier density is determined by their competition and can be expressed as @xmath42 = @xmath43 - 2[v_{\\texttt{se}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}]$ ] , where positive ( negative ) @xmath44 denotes the hole ( electron ) density . in an as - grown sample ,",
    "the cd@xmath40 defects are dominant and @xmath42 is positive ; accordingly , the chemical potential lies in the valence band .",
    "when annealed in evacuated quartz tubes , a portion of selenium goes into the gas phase se@xmath0 in equilibrium with the solid phase,@xcite resulting in the formation of more @xmath45 defects while leaving cd@xmath40 unaffected ( because the @xmath18 employed in the present study is much lower than the melting temperature of 710 @xmath14c ) .",
    "the equilibrated vapor pressure of se@xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath18 , @xcite creating more @xmath45 and eventually changing @xmath42 from positive to negative .    to be more quantitative ,",
    "one may assume that the increase in the se - vacancy concentration upon annealing , @xmath46 $ ] , is directly reflected in the increase in the number of se@xmath0 molecules in the quartz tube , which determines the se@xmath0 vapor pressure @xmath47 ; in constant volume , one expects a linear relation between @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath47 if the se@xmath0 vapor behaves as an ideal gas .",
    "according to ref . , the equilibrated se@xmath0 vapor pressure @xmath47 of bi@xmath48se@xmath49 is related to the absolute temperature @xmath35 via @xmath50 } = a - b / t { \\rm [ k]},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 = 7.81@xmath190.50 and @xmath32 = 10870@xmath19640 for the temperature range of 527 to 627 @xmath14c . from this @xmath35 dependence of @xmath52",

    ", width=321 ]    from the above results , it is clear that the highest level of compensation is achieved in samples annealed at 577 @xmath14c .",
    "we therefore measured the sample c of @xmath18 = 577 @xmath14c in a 14-t magnet using a rotation sample holder to investigate its sdh oscillations in detail . before the high - field measurements , to protect the surface state from aging , the top surface of the sample was covered with al@xmath0o@xmath1 in the following way : first , the crystal was cleaved on both surfaces with adhesive tapes to reveal fresh surfaces , mounted on a sample holder with ge varnish , and transferred into the sputtering chamber ; second , the top surface was cleaned by bias - sputtering with ar ions for 13 minutes and then , without breaking the vacuum , a 540-nm - thick al@xmath48o@xmath49 film was deposited by the rf magnetron sputtering . after this process",

    "5(e ) presents three well - defined peaks at @xmath67 = 11 t , @xmath68 = 27 t , and @xmath69 = 33 t , indicating that the observed oscillations are sdh oscillations with multiple frequencies .",
    "note that the second - harmonic in ac measurements is a distortion of the input sine wave , and its occurrence is an indication of a nonlinear response . in the present case , the sdh oscillations are apparently giving rise to a peculiar non - ohmicity .",

    "6(b ) , the angular dependences of all three frequencies in the ft spectra are consistent with @xmath72 .",
    "these results strongly suggest that the present sdh oscillations signify 2d fermi surface(s ) .",
