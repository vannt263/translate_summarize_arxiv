    "additional bursters are being detected as hard x - ray sources in a batse monitoring program ( barret et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "persistent hard x - ray emission may also be produced by msps , and the fact that gcs contain large numbers of msps makes them ideal systems in which to search for such emission ( chen 1991 , tavani 1993b ) .",

    "isolated msps could produce hard x - ray emission by the same mechanism operating in young crab - like pulsars",
    ". though the magnetic fields are smaller in recycled pulsars , the voltage drop at the light cylinder may be similar due to the smaller rotation periods ( ruderman and cheng 1988 ) . in binary systems , msps may emit hard x - rays by interaction with a companion ( tavani 1991 ) .",
    "this is in analogy to psr  b1957 + 20 in which the pulsar is evaporating its companion ( e.g. kluzniak et al . 1988 ) . in such systems",
    "the pulsar is partly or fully buried in a gaseous envelope originating from its companion .",
    "the interaction of the msp wind with the surrounding material produces energetic emission by synchrotron radiation or inverse compton scattering of shock accelerated particles .",
    "emission , which can be explained by this model , has recently been observed in the @xmath23  kev range from the binary pulsar psr  1259 - 63 near periastron ( grove et al .",

    "source fluxes are measured by batse using the earth as an occulting object .",
    "as a source rises or sets , steps appears in the detector count rates due to attenuation by the earth s atmosphere .",
    "source fluxes are determined by fitting the amplitude of these steps .",
    "thus , depending on the geometry of the earth s rising and setting limbs , one can make two source measurements per gro orbit ( approximately 90 min . ) , and from these construct a light curve .",
    "fluxes in the resulting light curve , for a location in the sky with no sources , form a distribution about a mean flux of zero . both positive and negative",
    "fluxes are produced in the occultation edge fits , all with formal error estimates .",
    "the distribution of flux estimates has a width which is larger than expected for a poisson distribution of background rates .",
    "this is due to systematic effects , such as contributions in the occultation fits from nearby sources and spurious background fluctuations .    the main limitation of the occultation technique is source confusion due to the large angular extent of the earth s occulting limbs .",
    "there are several diagnostics that can be employed to identify confused sources .",
    "one such check is to compare the measured relative rates in separate detectors to the rates expected given the batse detector responses ( pendleton et al .",
    "another technique is to compare the rates from the rising limb to those from the setting limb . for constant flux from the expected source ,",
    "the rising and setting edges should give the same rates .",
    "the precession of the earth s limb can also be used to localize the emission , a technique that has been successfully employed to create images of sky regions for brighter , long duration events ( zhang et al .",

    "a , we have analyzed the rate history of each cluster for events with structure on a time scale of one or more days .",
    "generally in each light curve there are several  events \" apparent ; most of these can be attributed to interference from nearby bright sources .",
    "there are , however , a few spikes that can not readily be explained as interfering sources .",
    "none of these events are particularly outstanding in terms of amplitude or structure . for search  b",
    "we have further analyzed such events to determine if they originate from the clusters , as described below .",
    "for the 23 clusters in search  a , however , such an analysis is impractical . for search  a , therefore , we take the largest of the outstanding features to set conservative upper limits to the minimum observable event amplitude ( table  [ table : roughlimits ] ) .",
    "we initially find count rate upper limits ( @xmath35 in table  [ table : roughlimits ] ) .",
    "to convert these limits to photon fluxes , we have multiplied by a constant conversion factor determined from other light curves for which we have properly deconvolved the instrument response with an assumed photon index of 2.0 to generate photon flux histories .",
    "this conversion is accurate to within approximately @xmath36 . from the photon rate , we calculate a luminosity upper limit by assuming power law spectra with index 2 .",
    "the effective time coverage for each cluster is shown in table  [ table : roughlimits ] .",
    "coverage with batse is less than @xmath37 and varies as a function of sky position due to the geometry of the earth s occulting limbs and due to interfering sources .",
    "when target occultations occur within 10 seconds of the occultation of a bright interfering source , no edge fits are produced .",
    "this leads to data gaps , as in the case of ngc  6760 , which has highly non - uniform coverage due to the nearby source aql  x-1 .",
    "note that we obtain a limit of @xmath38  erg  s@xmath4 for ngc  5272 ( m3 ) which is known to contain a time variable supersoft x - ray source .",
    "note also that the cluster ngc  6440 has been excluded from our search due to nearby interfering sources .",
    "for search  b , we have produced rate histories over the time period mentioned above and properly deconvolved the detector response to obtain photon light curves .",
    "we have searched these light curves for outburst events .",
    "candidate events are identified as features of duration one or more days which rise at least @xmath39 above the background flux distribution . with this criterion",
    "we have identified 40 possible candidate events .",
    "we analyzed each of these isolated events further to determine if they originate from the clusters .",
    "we check for nearby interfering sources and compare the relative rates in the detectors .",
    "this analysis eliminates all but 13 of the events as candidates .",
    "these 13 candidates consist of peak - like structures with durations of 1 to 8 days .",
    "the significance of these events , as measured from the photon flux error bars near the peaks , ranges from @xmath7 to @xmath40 .",
    "the maximum luminosities in these candidate events would range from @xmath41  erg  s@xmath4 , and in one case @xmath42  erg  s@xmath4 ( @xmath0  kev ) .",
    "these luminosities are similar to the expected transient peak luminosities ( c.f .",
    "table  [ table : hardx ] ) and deserve further investigation .",
    "we further analyze candidate events by studying the correlation between the rising and setting rates within a given gro pointing period .",
    "figures  [ fig : ngc6752cand ] and [ fig : ngc5139cand ] show example rate histories for candidate events in ngc  6752 and ngc  5139 . for each source ,",
    "the rise and set rates clearly have different temporal behaviors . in each case",
    "nearly all the flux is from the fits in the rising limbs .",
    "formally we can calculate the correlation coefficient for the rising vs setting rates . as a test of this technique we have calculated the correlation coefficient for a two day data sample from the crab . the rise and set",
    "data for the crab are well correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and a corresponding probability of @xmath43 that the observed correlation could arise from a random sample .",
    "for the two events shown in figures  [ fig : ngc6752cand ] and [ fig : ngc5139cand ] the correlation coefficients are -0.07 and -0.10 respectively , with a @xmath44 and @xmath45 probability of being random .",
    "we have calculated the correlation coefficient for the other 11 candidate events during the relevant time intervals . for each event",
    "the rises and sets either show very weak correlation or , in several cases , strong anticorrelation .",
    "the most significant correlation has a @xmath46 probability of being random .",
    "the lack of significant positive correlations imply that the  events \" observed in the light curves do not originate from the target sources but are due to interfering sources located elsewhere .    as a check to this interpretation",
    "we have analyzed the event in ngc  6752 shown in figure  [ fig : ngc6752cand ] in more depth .",
    "we have chosen to look further at this particular event because it is somewhat extended in time , lasting for approximately 5 days , and reaches moderate flux levels .",
    "we have produced a map in an approximately @xmath47 region centered on ngc  6752 during the time of the candidate event .",
    "the map is created by forming a grid of points separated by @xmath48 , and producing occultation histories for each grid point .",
    "the resulting rates for each point can be combined together to form a map .",
    "the map for the ngc  6752 event shows an emission enhancement well localized at @xmath49 ` northeast ' of the cluster during the first gro pointing period ( tjd  @xmath50 ) .",
    "it is also clear from the limb geometry that such an event would be visible only on the setting rates , and indeed this is what is observed in the rate history for ngc  6752 . during the second pointing period ( tjd  @xmath51 )",
    ", the emission peak moves to @xmath52 ` southwest ' of the cluster , and is well localized only in the detector with the less optimal pointing .",
    "all of this leads us to conclude that the enhancement is not associated with the cluster .      in the absence of any detected transient events , we are able to set a lower limit to the recurrence times of transient sources in the clusters of search  b. for a given time interval in a gc light curve , there will be a minimum luminosity , @xmath53 , at which an event would be visible .",
    "@xmath53 is determined by the width of the flux distribution .",
    "we step through the cluster light curves and determine the total number of days that events of different @xmath53s would be observable .",
    "the result is a distribution of the number of days observable vs @xmath53 ( figure  [ fig : cov_all ] ) .",
    "the @xmath53 distribution depends on the assumed duration of outburst events and the photon index used in the deconvolution .",
    "this dependence , however , is rather weak .",
    "the distribution depends more strongly on the time intervals into which the data are integrated .",
    "figure  [ fig : cov_int ] shows the @xmath53 distribution for different data integration times .",
    "the minimum observable luminosities are shifted down at longer integration times due to an increased sensitivity , i.e. a smaller width in the distribution of fluxes .",

    "we have obtained these upper limits by formal error calculations integrating over large time windows . as discussed in section 3 , such a procedure yields error values systematically larger than the actual flux distribution .",
    "we have studied this effect for the four gcs of search  b and determined a correction factor of 1.6 based on fitted widths of flux distributions .",
    "we have used the factor of 1.6 correction to the formal error estimates for the upper limit values of table  [ table : persist_limits ] .",
    "the clusters of search  b were chosen to limit the systematic effects of interfering sources , a selection which permits very sensitive flux limits .",
    "we note that the sensitivities may depend on the assumed spectral shape used in deconvolution .",
    "we have employed power law spectra with photon index 2.0 .",
    "using our upper limits , we constrain the number of isolated high energy emitting msps in the clusters .",
    "the luminosity for a typical non - interacting msp can be calculated .",
    "chen ( 1991 ) does this using the outer - gap emission model of cheng , ho and ruderman ( 1986 ) and the observed period distribution for msps .",
    "the resulting luminosity from a cluster is a constant times the number of isolated msps , assuming isotropic emission . for a cluster with one msp",
    ", this would yield a luminosity of approximately @xmath74  erg  s@xmath4 . combining this luminosity estimate with our luminosity upper limit",
    ", we find the maximum number of isolated msps , @xmath64 , in each of the clusters ( table  [ table : persist_limits ] ) .",
    "the estimate of @xmath64 depends on the period distribution of msps . in the luminosity calculation ,",
    "chen ( 1991 ) , uses the period distribution of all the 28 then - known msps , fit as a falling power law .",
    "this distribution is poorly constrained due to selection effects and small number statistics and may vary from cluster to cluster .",
    "this adds additional uncertainty to our values of @xmath64 .",
    "the flux from an interacting binary msp has been estimated by tavani ( 1993b ) . using this model we calculate the estimated flux from each cluster for a single interacting msp system , @xmath65 ( table  [ table : persist_limits ] ) .",
    "combined with our flux upper limits , the flux estimate yields an upper limit on the number of interacting msps , @xmath66 .",
    "the constraints on @xmath66 are weak .",
    "this calculation uses an average msp spin - down power of @xmath75  erg  s@xmath4 ( taylor et al .",
    "msp spin - down powers are in the range @xmath76-@xmath21  erg  s@xmath4 but are still not well constrained .",
    "we have monitored 27 galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) with batse during a period of approximately four years each .",
    "we have detected no distinct hard x - ray outburst episodes and no persistent emission .",
    "the lack of detected events has several interesting implications .    for the gcs with dim x - ray sources ( dxss )",
    ", we find a lower limit for the outburst recurrence time from dxss of @xmath77  years .",
    "this limit excludes the existence of ` aql  x-1-like ' objects ( i.e. , persistent x - ray sources subject to major x - ray outbursts with a time scale of @xmath78 year ) , since @xmath55 is comparable to or greater than this outburst recurrence time scale .",
    "this suggests that the dxss in these clusters are not lmxbs similar to aql  x-1 .",
    "the lack of strong outburst events in our search means we also have no evidence of accreting bhs in gcs .",
    "if active bh binaries exist in gcs , they would be clearly detectable with hard x - ray luminosities of order of @xmath79  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "we have calculated upper limits on persistent hard x - ray emission from gcs .",
    "the limiting luminosity is @xmath80  erg  s@xmath4 for the closest clusters .",
    "the limit for 47  tuc is somewhat more sensitive than previous measurements",
    ". a model - dependent but reasonable estimate of the expected hard x - ray magnetospheric emission from isolated msps ( chen 1991 ) implies that the number of isolated msps emitting hard x - rays in 47  tuc is less than 19 . taking the observed 11 msps in 47  tuc , and a beaming factor of 2 for short period pulsars , this upper limit is comparable to actual number of msps in 47  tuc .",
    "our results are therefore a constrain the magnetospheric model of msp hard x - ray emission .",
    "our upper limits on persistent hard x - ray emission also provide a mild constraint on the number of interacting pulsars in binaries . the observed efficiency ( a few percent ) of conversion of pulsar spindown luminosity into hard x - ray emission in the case of the periastron passage of the be star / pulsar system psr  b1259 - 63 ( tavani et al . 1996 , grove et al . 1995 ) together with the observed msp spindown average luminosity of @xmath75",
    "erg  s@xmath4 implies a limit to the gc population interacting pulsar binaries .",
    "we find limits of @xmath81 interacting msps in the clusters studied .",
