    "am canum venaticorum ( am cvn ) stars are a rare class of compact hydrogen - deficient interacting binaries , comprised of white dwarfs ( wds ) accreting he - rich material from low mass degenerate or semi - degenerate companions ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "the orbital periods of these systems range from 5 to 65 min .",
    "this implies highly evolved components and makes them , along with their ultra - compact x - ray binary equivalents , one of the most compact classes of binary system known .",
    "the prototype system for the class of object was discovered in 1967 , and has an orbital period of 17  min @xcite . since then , 43 confirmed am cvn systems have been discovered @xcite .",
    "not only are these systems interesting as one of the possible end points for binary wd evolution @xcite , they are also potentially strong sources of gravitational wave emission due to their compact configurations @xcite , and they may be the progenitors of peculiar `` dot ia '' supernovae @xcite .    as binaries , am cvn systems can yield detailed information on the masses and radii of the two components if eclipses and radial velocity variations can be observed .",
    "eclipsing systems in particular offer the possibility of measuring full system parameters , including inclination and component masses , from time - series photometry alone .",
    "the most robust results come from systems in which the white dwarf is totally eclipsed .",
    "the extreme mass ratios of am cvns mean that the likelihood of observing such systems is low and currently only two eclipsing am cvn systems are known . sdssj0926 + 3624",
    "was the first eclipsing am cvn star to be discovered @xcite , however its wd is only partially eclipsed .",
    "a second partial eclipser ( ptf1 j191905.19 + 481506.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was recently discovered , but it only eclipses the edge of the disc and not the wd , and so can not be used for parameter determination .    determining the nature of",
    "the secondary ( donor ) star is critical to our understanding of the past evolution of the system , since the three binary evolution channels proposed to form am cvn stars are best distinguished by the state of the donor star at the onset of mass transfer .",
    "if the primary wd is accreting from another he - rich wd , the binary must have undergone two common envelope events in the past to reduce it to the observed compact configuration .",
    "this is known as the double degenerate channel @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if the donor is not fully degenerate at the time when it leaves the second common envelope , the donor will be more massive than in the case of the double - degenerate channel .",
    "mass loss will cause it to become increasingly degenerate as the binary evolves @xcite . at the longest observed orbital periods ( i.e. , the oldest am cvn systems ) , the two channels become indistinguishable .",
    "the donor is predicted to reach the same near - zero temperature , low entropy configuration in both cases @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is that the binary may start mass transfer as a hydrogen - rich cataclysmic variable .",
    "such a system could evolve to an am cvn star if the donor star had already started to evolve by the time mass transfer starts , and results in a hotter , more massive donor star and traces of hydrogen may be expected in such systems @xcite .    in this paper , we present follow - up observations and preliminary modelling of the am cvn system gaia14aae ( ra = 16:11:33.97 , dec= + 63:08:31.8 , * ? ? ?",

    "the temperature of the wd implies an accretion rate , if accretion - heated , of @xmath27  m@xmath1  yr@xmath28 for 0.75m@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "combined with the masses we derive , this accretion rate is more consistent with a degenerate donor @xcite , suggesting that the system may have descended from a merging double wd , and that it may have had a much shorter orbital period in the past ( @xmath2910  min ) .    for comparison , we can compare the accretion rate implied from the wd temperature to the stability criteria of the disc instability model in @xcite .",
    "a disc will be stable in the high state if it is too hot and it will be stable in the low state if it is too cold . for the system to be unstable , the accretion rate in the disk must be between the limits for the critical accretion rate for hot ( @xmath30 ) and cold ( @xmath31 ) stable equilibrium accretion rates . for an inclination of 90@xmath32 , with no hydrogen , 98 per cent helium and 2 per cent metals ,",

    "thus , gaia14aae is consistent with the disc instability models for am cvn stars , since the accretion rate inferred from the wd temperature lies in the unstable regime at this orbital period and mass .",
    "our estimate of the accretion rate could be too high because the wd temperature at the long period of gaia14aae may be set by simple wd cooling @xcite .",

    "_ gaia _ will also provide parallax and proper motion , and having an accurate distance to the system will allow system parameters , such as the wd temperature , to be better constrained .",
    "finally , long term precision timing will be needed to detect the expected period change due to gravitational radiation - driven mass transfer .",
