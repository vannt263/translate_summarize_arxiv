    "the coloured tev - scale sparticles , squarks ( @xmath0 ) and gluinos ( @xmath1 ) , would be produced copiously in hadronic collisions and thus offer the strongest sensitivity for supersymmetry searches at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we consider the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm)@xcite where , as a consequence of r - parity conservation , squarks and gluinos are pair - produced in collisions of two hadrons @xmath2 and @xmath3 : @xmath4 the production of top squarks ( stops ) , @xmath5 , has to be treated separately , because the strong yukawa coupling between top quarks , stops and higgs fields gives rise to potentially large mixing effects and mass splitting.@xcite in eq .",

    "searches for squarks and gluinos at the proton  antiproton collider tevatron with a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath9  tev have placed lower limits on squark and gluino masses in the range of 300 to 400gev , depending in detail on the specific susy model.@xcite the proton ",

    "the nlo corrections are dominated by soft gluon emission off the coloured particles in the initial and final state and by the coulomb corrections due to the exchange of gluons between the massive sparticles in the final state .",
    "the soft - gluon corrections can be taken into account to all orders in perturbation theory by means of threshold resummation techniques.@xcite    recently , such a threshold resummation has been performed for all mssm squark and gluino production processes , eq.([eq : processes ] ) , at next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) accuracy.@xcite@xcite a formalism has been developed in the framework of effective field theories which allows for the resummation of soft and coulomb gluons in the production of coloured sparticles , but has so far only been applied to squark - antisquark production.@xcite in addition , the dominant next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections , including those coming from the resummed cross section at next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) level , have been calculated for squark - antisquark pair - production.@xcite the production of gluino bound states as well as bound - state effects in gluino - pair production has also been studied.@xcite    in this work we will present the state - of - the - art susy - qcd predictions for the mssm squark and gluino hadroproduction processes , eq .",

    "the stop cross section is shown separately . note",
    "that since mixing in the stop sector enters explicitly only through higher - order diagrams , the stop - mixing angle @xmath46 need not be renormalized and one can use the lowest - order expression derived from the stop mass matrix . beyond lo",
    "the stop cross section does not only depend on the stop mass , but also on the gluino mass @xmath47 , the average mass of the first and second generation squarks @xmath41 and the mixing angle @xmath46 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath47 , @xmath41 and @xmath46 according to the sps1a benchmark scenario.@xcite note , however , that the dependence of the stop cross section on the susy parameters that enter only at nlo is numerically very small with variations of at most 2%.@xcite the numerical results presented for stop production also apply to sbottom production when the same input parameters are adopted , since the impact of bottom - quark induced contributions to sbottom hadroproduction is negligible.@xcite    for convenience we define the average mass of the final - state sparticle pair @xmath48 , which reduces to the squark and gluino mass for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 final states , respectively .",

    "let us now discuss the numerical results for squark and gluino hadroproduction at the tevatron , and at the lhc operating with 7 and 14tev hadronic centre - of - mass energy .",
    "we shall study the scale dependence of the lo , nlo and nlo+nll cross sections , the impact of the nll threshold resummation , and present our best predictions at nlo+nll for the inclusive cross sections , including the theoretical uncertainties from scale variation as well as the pdf and @xmath54 errors .",

    "we show these results for the case @xmath57 . in fig.[fig : xs_sum_tev ] the total nlo+nll cross section for the sum of all four processes , i.e.  @xmath58 and @xmath59 production , is presented . for the central values ,",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are taken as @xmath60 , which is the scale choice adopted as the preferred one in the context of the nlo susy - qcd calculations.@xcite@xcite the error band represents an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty of the cross section prediction .",
    "it consists of the 68% c.l .",
    "pdf and @xmath17 error , added in quadrature , and the error from scale variation in the range @xmath61 added linearly to the combined pdf and @xmath17 uncertainty . by this linear combination of scale uncertainty and combined pdf and @xmath17 errors we provide a conservative estimate of the theory error .    at the scale @xmath62 the cross - section predictions are enhanced by soft - gluon resummation .",
    "the relative @xmath63-factor @xmath64 for this scale choice is displayed in fig.[fig : knll_tev ] for squark and gluino masses in the range between 200 and 600gev , and stop masses between 100 and 300gev .",
    "the soft - gluon corrections are moderate for @xmath65 and @xmath66 production , but increase the predictions for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath67 final states by around 15 , 20 and 40% , respectively , assuming squark and gluino masses near 500gev . because of the increasing importance of the threshold region , the corrections in general become larger for increasing sparticle masses .",
    "the large effect of soft - gluon resummation for @xmath67 and @xmath51 production can be mostly attributed to the importance of gluon initial states for these processes .",
    "furthermore , the presence of gluinos in the final state results in an enhancement of the nll contributions , since in this case the casimir invariants that enter the @xmath68 coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) are larger than for processes involving only squarks .",
    "the substantial value of @xmath69 for @xmath50 production at the tevatron is a consequence of the behaviour of the corresponding nlo corrections@xcite , which strongly decrease with increasing squark mass .",
    "let us next discuss the scale dependence of the susy - qcd cross - section prediction in some more detail .",
    "fig.[fig : scale_tev ] shows the scale dependence in lo , nlo and nlo+nll for the different production processes , listed in eq.([eq : processes ] ) , at the tevatron .",
    "the mass of the @xmath70-squarks and the gluino mass have been set to @xmath71gev , while the stop mass is fixed to @xmath72gev .",
    "note that the lo predictions are obtained with the lo mstw pdf set@xcite and the corresponding lo value for @xmath17 .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are set equal to each other and varied around the average mass of the final state sparticles , @xmath73 .",
    "we observe the usual strong reduction of the scale dependence when going from lo to nlo .",
    "a further significant improvement is obtained when the resummation of threshold logarithms is included , in particular for @xmath51 and @xmath67 production . for the @xmath74 and @xmath51 final states , contributing the most to the inclusive squark and gluino cross section at the tevatron ,",
    "the lo , nlo and nlo+nll cross section predictions converge particularly well near @xmath75 , which appears to be the preferred scale choice for these processes .",
    "susy searches at the lhc , which is currently operating at 7tev , will soon be sensitive to sparticles with masses in the tev - range .",
    "we thus discuss the cross section predictions for the lhc @ 7tev in more detail , including in particular the dependence of the nll corrections on the ratio of the gluino and squark masses , and the size of the theory uncertainty due to scale , pdf and @xmath17 errors .    as before , we first present the nlo+nll cross section predictions for the five individual processes and for the sum of the @xmath76 final states , cf.figs.[fig:xs_lhc7 ] and [ fig : xs_sum_lhc7 ] .",
    "we include the estimate of the theory uncertainty obtained from adding linearly the scale dependence in the range @xmath61 to the combined 68% c.l .",
    "pdf and @xmath17 error , added in quadrature .    in fig.[fig :",
    "knll_lhc7 ] we show the enhancement of the cross section due to the nll resummation at the scale @xmath62 . for gluino - pair and squark - gluino production processes",
    "we find a significant increase of 10 - 20% at masses around 1tev .",
    "an enhancement of up to 10% can also be observed for the production of heavy stop particles .",
    "note that the singularities at the stop - decay threshold @xmath77gev originate from the stop wave - function renormalization .",
    "they are an unphysical artefact of an on - shell scheme approach@xcite and could be removed by taking into account the finite widths of the unstable stops .",
    "the effect of the nll resummation on the cross section for inclusive squark and gluino production is shown in fig.[fig : knll_inc_lhc7 ] .",
    "next , we present the scale dependence in lo , nlo and nlo+nll for the various production processes , see fig.[fig : scale_lhc7 ] . here , the mass of the @xmath78-squarks and the gluino mass have been set to @xmath79gev , while the stop mass is fixed to @xmath80gev . as anticipated , we observe a significant reduction of the scale dependence when going from lo to nlo and from nlo to nlo+nll .",
    "note that also for squark and gluino production at the lhc , the convergence of the lo , nlo and nlo+nll cross section predictions near the scale @xmath75 is striking .",
    "as the cross section predictions for the lhc operating at 7tev are of particular phenomenological importance , let us discuss the results in some more detail .",
    "first , we collect representative values for lo , nlo and nlo+nll cross sections in tables[tbl1]-[tbl3 ] .",
    "we include the scale dependence in the range @xmath61 for the lo , nlo and nlo+nll calculations , and the 68% c.l .",
    "pdf and @xmath17 error at nlo .",
    "the nlo and nll @xmath63-factors are displayed for convenience .",
    "the nlo and nlo+nll theory predictions with the default mstw pdf set@xcite are compared to those obtained with the ct10 pdf set@xcite .",
    "the lo cross sections are calculated with the lo mstw@xcite and the cteq6l1@xcite pdfs . while the lo cross sections differ significantly between the two pdf sets , the central nlo+nll predictions are consistent within the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "note , however , that the 68% c.l .  pdf error estimate for the ct10 set , obtained through rescaling of the 90% cl error estimate@xcite , is significantly larger than that of mstw .",
    "the size of the cross section and the impact of the higher - order corrections depends on the ratio @xmath81 . in fig.[fig : knll_r_lhc7 ] we thus present the nll @xmath63-factor for different values of @xmath82 for individual processes with the @xmath76 final states . in general , in the range of values of @xmath82 studied here , the dependence of the soft - gluon enhancement on @xmath82 is moderate .",
    "of particular interest is the limit @xmath83 , i.e.  the limit of very heavy squarks .",
    "such scenarios are predicted within so - called models of split supersymmetry@xcite and lead to interesting new phenomenological signatures at the lhc , like long - lived gluinos.@xcite in fig.[fig : r0_lhc7 ] we present the nlo+nll cross section prediction for gluino - pair production in the limit @xmath84 and show the impact of soft - gluon resummation .",
    "the @xmath51 cross section for @xmath85 is higher than for @xmath86 , with the difference growing from a factor of 1.2 at @xmath87 gev up to a factor of 4.7 for @xmath88 tev .",
    "the impact of soft - gluon resummation is significant , and the nll corrections enhance the cross section by about 12% for gluinos with masses around 1tev .",
    "the enhancement of the cross section prediction due to higher - order corrections depends , of course , on the choice of scale .",
    "choosing @xmath89 , we find in general nll @xmath63-factors close to one for sparticle cross sections at the lhc with 7tev .",
    "however , a crucial improvement when going from lo to nlo and from nlo to nlo+nll is the reduction of the scale dependence .",
    "fig.[fig : scale_mass_lhc7 ] shows a comparison of the nlo and the nlo+nll scale dependence for the sum of the @xmath76 final states as a function of the average sparticle mass , assuming @xmath90 .",
    "threshold resummation leads to a significant reduction of the scale dependence over the full range of sparticle masses , with an overall scale uncertainty at nlo+nll of less than 10% . in a phenomenological analysis",
    ", the different production channels may contribute with different weight , depending in detail on the signature and the choice of selection cuts .",
    "thus , we plot the scale uncertainty at nlo+nll for the different channels in fig.[fig : scale_mass_ind_lhc7 ] .",
    "we also show the full theory uncertainty , consisting of the 68% c.l .",
    "pdf and @xmath17 error added in quadrature , combined linearly with the scale variation error for the nlo cross sections and for the nlo+nll cross sections .",
    "we find that even though the pdf uncertainty is significant , the inclusion of threshold resummation leads to a sizeable reduction of the overall theory uncertainty .",
    "this is particularly true for the case of gluino - pair and squark - gluino production . for gluino - pair production ,",
    "the total theory uncertainty can be reduced by as much as a factor of two when going from nlo to nlo+nll .",
    "looking at all different production processes , the overall theory uncertainty at nlo+nll is approximately 20% or smaller .",
    "susy particles with masses in the multi - tev region can be probed at the lhc running at or near its design energy of 14tev.@xcite to complete this review and to show how the impact of the higher - order corrections depends on the collider energy , we also present predictions for squark and gluino production at the lhc with 14tev .",
    "our cross section predictions at nlo+nll including the full theory uncertainty , consisting of the 68% c.l .",
    "pdf and @xmath17 error , added in quadrature , combined linearly with the scale variation error , are shown in figs.[fig : xs_lhc14 ] and [ fig : xs_sum_lhc14 ] .",
    "as for the lhc at 7 tev , the impact of nll threshold resummation is particularly significant for gluino - pair and squark - gluino production , with nll corrections of about 30% for @xmath51 final states and squark and gluino masses of 2.5tev , see fig.[fig : knll_lhc14 ] .",
    "finally , in fig.[fig : scale_lhc14 ] we show the lo , nlo and nlo+nll scale dependence for squark and gluino masses of 1tev and @xmath80gev .",
    "the results are qualitatively very similar to those obtained for the lhc with 7tev , i.e.  we find a strong reduction of the scale dependence when including the high - order corrections , and a very good convergence of the perturbative series at scales near @xmath75 .",
    "precise theoretical predictions for sparticle cross sections are essential for the interpretation of current and future searches for supersymmetry at hadron colliders .",
    "the inclusion of higher - order susy - qcd corrections reduces the scale uncertainty substantially .",
    "the higher - order terms also increase the size of the cross section with respect to the lo prediction for renormalization and factorization scales near the average mass of the produced susy particles .",
    "thus , the susy - qcd corrections have a significant impact on the extraction of susy mass bounds from experimental cross section limits , and would lead to a much more accurate determination of susy parameters like masses and couplings in the case of discovery .    in this review",
    "we have presented the state - of - the - art susy - qcd predictions for squark and gluino hadroproduction cross sections at the tevatron and the lhc at 7 and 14tev centre - of - mass energy , including nlo corrections and nll threshold resummation .",
    "we have discussed the impact of the susy - qcd corrections on the cross sections and have provided an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to scale variation , parton distribution functions , and the strong coupling @xmath17 .",
    "special emphasis has been placed on the predictions for the lhc at 7tev energy , which are of immediate relevance for ongoing susy searches .",
    "the effect of soft - gluon resummation is most pronounced for processes with initial - state gluons and final - state gluinos , which involve a large colour charge .",
    "specifically , at the lhc with 7tev we find an increase of the cross - section prediction of up to 20% for sparticle masses around 1tev when going from nlo to nlo+nll , depending in detail on the final state and the ratio of squark to gluino masses .",
    "furthermore , the scale uncertainty is reduced significantly at nlo+nll accuracy over the full range of sparticle masses relevant for hadron collider searches , with a remaining scale uncertainty of less than 10% .",
    "we have furthermore presented estimates for the overall theory uncertainty including the 68% c.l .",
    "pdf and @xmath17 error added in quadrature , combined linearly with the scale variation error .",
    "even though the pdf and @xmath17 uncertainty is significant , the inclusion of threshold resummation leads to a sizeable reduction of the overall theory uncertainty , which is in general 20% or smaller for nlo+nll cross sections calculated with 2008 nlo mstw pdfs .",
    "the nlo+nll cross sections presented in this paper constitute the state - of - the - art qcd predictions for squark and gluino production in the mssm , and provide therefore , we think , the optimum theoretical basis to interpret current and future searches for supersymmetry at the tevatron and the lhc .",
