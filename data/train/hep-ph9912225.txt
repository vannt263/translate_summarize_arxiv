    "a neutrino transition magnetic moment can account , both for the observed deficiency of the solar neutrino flux and the time variations of the signal .",

    "the time dependence may be caused by time variations of the convective magnetic field of the sun @xcite . in transverse magnetic fields ,",
    "neutrinos with transition magnetic moments will experience spin and flavor rotation simultaneously ( resonant spin - flavor precession , rsfp ) . the observation of electron antineutrinos from the sun would lead to the conclusion that the neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "there are however stringent bounds on the presence of solar electron antineutrinos coming from solar @xmath1b neutrinos @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields measured on the surface of the sun are weaker than those ones within the interior of the convective zone .",

    ", one can explain such fields in a self - consistent way if these fields are generated by the existence of a dynamo effect at the bottom of the convective zone . in this region",
    "the strength of small scale regular magnetic fields could reach a value of 100 kg .",
    "these fields propagate through the convective zone and photosphere decreasing in strength while increasing in the scale giving traces in from of loops in bipolar active regions ( solar spots ) .",
    "large - scale toroidal magnetic field created by a dynamo mechanism in convective zone typically have strengths even less than small - scale r.m.s fields near the bottom of convective zone .",
    "this is the main reason why one should consider neutrino propagation in the random magnetic field of the sun .",
    "the ratio of the r.m.s . random field and the regular ( toroidal ) field may be about @xmath3 20 - 50 , therefore the problem of rsfp neutrino propagation in noisy magnetic field seems to be important .",
    "estimations for the ratio of rms fields to regular field are necessarily very rough . in textbooks",

    "the magnetic field will have two well differentiated components .",
    "the first component will be a theoretically motivated solar magnetic field profile : solution to the static magnetic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "as a second component , we include a layer of magnetic noise generated at the bottom of the convective zone , we have justified that the level of noise in this region can certainly be very high .",
