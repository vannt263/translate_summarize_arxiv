    "recently , atlas @xcite , alice @xcite and lhcb @xcite collaborations have measured inclusive distributions of different charmed mesons .",
    "the lhcb collaboration has measured in addition a few correlation observables for charmed meson - antimeson pairs in the forward rapidity region @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "previously , the star collaboration at rhic has measured only @xmath12 correlation of charmed mesons and leptons from their semileptonic decays @xcite .",
    "an examination of @xmath13 meson - antimeson correlations was accessible only at the tevatron where first midrapidity measurements of @xmath13 azimuthal angle correlations have been performed by the cdf experiment @xcite .",
    "commonly in the exploration of heavy quark production the main efforts concentrate on inclusive distributions . improved schemes of standrad pqcd nlo collinear approach , e.g. fonll @xcite or gm - vfns @xcite are state of art in this respect .",
    "these models can be , however , used only when transverse momenta of charm quark and antiquark are balanced .",
    "this means in practice that it can not be used for studies of correlation observables , which provide broader kinematical characteristic of the process under consideration .",
    "another approach which is much more efficient in this respect is the so - called @xmath1-factorization ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    ", the transverse momenta of incident partons are explicitly taken into account and their emission is encoded in the unintegrated gluon distributions  the building blocks of the formalism .",
    "this allows to construct different correlation distributions which are strictly related with the transverse momenta of initial particles .",
    "in addition , within the @xmath1-factorization approach it is possible to study interesting low - x effects , which may appear especially in the case of charm production . in principle a comparison of experimental data and predictions with the unintegrated gluon distribution functions ( ugdfs ) which include such effects may tell us more , e.g. about indication of the saturation ",
    "the topic being extensively studied in recent years .",
    "moreover , it was recently argued that the cross section for @xmath6 production at lhc energies may be very large due to mechanism of double - parton scattering ( dps ) , which is a completely new situation @xcite .",
    "the double scattering effects were studied in several other processes such as four jet production , production of @xmath14 pairs or production of four charged leptons , however , in all the cases the dps contributions have been found to be much smaller than the conventional single - parton scattering ( sps ) mechanisms .    in the meanwhile",
    "the lhcb collaboration measured the cross section for the production of @xmath15 meson - meson pairs at @xmath16 = 7 tev which is surprisingly large , including interesting correlation distributions @xcite .",
    "so far those data sets for double open charm production have been studied differentially only within the @xmath1-factorization approach using unintegrated gluon distributions @xcite , where several observables useful to identify the dps effects in the case of double open charm production have been carefully discussed .",
    "separately the production of double hidden charm was studied e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath17 process . there",
    "the sps single-@xmath18 and dps double-@xmath18 contributions are comparable .",
    "furthermore , the dps contribution exceeds the sps contribution for large rapidity distance between the two @xmath18 s .",
    "this is similar to the case of @xmath6 production @xcite .    in order to draw definite conclusions about the dps effects in double-@xmath19 meson production",
    "it is necessary to carefully estimate contribution to @xmath6 final state from the standard mechanism of single - parton scattering .",
    "the latter mechanism constitutes higher - order correction to conventional sps single @xmath0 production and one may expect suppression in comparison to the dps contribution , however , it should be accurately calculated in order to reduce uncertainty of the dps theoretcal model .",
    "so far the sps contribution was calculated only in high - energy approximation @xcite , which is relevant for large rapidity separation between produced mesons . since , in the lhcb experiment the condition of large rapidity distances",
    "is not always fulfilled , it seems to be essential to perform exact calculations .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the case of charm production in proton - proton scatering at the lhc one enters a quite new kinematical and dynamical domain . since the production of charm quarks at high energies",
    "is known to be dominated by the gluon - gluon fusion , the charm production at the lhc can be used to verify the quite different models of ugdfs .",
    "it is very interesting and important to test various unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature @xcite in hadronic reactions , in the kinematical regimes never achieved before .",
    "in contrast to the collinear gluon distributions ( pdfs ) the ugdfs are based on different theoretical assumptions and differ considerably among themselves .",
    "therefore , one may expect that they could lead to different production rates of @xmath0 pairs at the lhc .",
    "the cross section for the production of a pair of charm quark  charm antiquark can be written as : @xmath20 the main ingredients in the formula are off - shell matrix element for @xmath21 subprocess and unintegrated gluon distributions ( ugdf ) .",
    "the relevant matrix elements are known and can be found e.g. in ref .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distributions are functions of longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath22 or @xmath23 of gluon with respect to its parent nucleon and of gluon transverse momenta @xmath24 .",
    "some of them depend in addition on the factorization scale @xmath25 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fractions can be calculated as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transverse mass of produced quark / antiquark .",
    "the numerical quark - level results may be compared to real experimental data after inclusion of the hadronization effects .",
    "the transition from the quark level to open heavy meson states has to be performed . in the case of charm ( or bottom ) particles , the hadronization is usually done with the help of fragmentation functions .",
    "the inclusive distributions of charmed mesons can be then obtained through a convolution of inclusive distributions of charm quarks / antiquarks and @xmath28 d fragmentation functions : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the fraction of longitudinal momentum of heavy quark carried by meson .",
    "we have made typical approximation assuming that @xmath32 is unchanged in the fragmentation process , i.e. @xmath33 .    in our calculations we use standard peterson model of fragmentation function @xcite with the parameter @xmath34 for pseudoscalar , and bcfy model @xcite with @xmath35 for vector @xmath19 meson states , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the fragmentation scheme applied in the fonll framework , where rather hard fragmentation functions for charm quarks are suggested @xcite .",
    "this issue as well as effects of applying other fragmentation functions from the literature , together with aspects of qcd evolution , are carefully discussed in ref .",
