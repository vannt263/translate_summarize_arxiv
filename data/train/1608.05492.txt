    "[ conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dynamical iatm is given by @xmath5 where the first two summations are over the nearest neighbors of the lattice , while the last one is over all the lattice sites .",
    "here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the @xmath8 components of the spin variables at a site @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the bilinear exchange interactions of both of the ising models .",
    "@xmath11 is the four spin interaction , which couples two ising models to produce the iatm . dynamical character of the model comes from the time dependent external longitudinal magnetic field @xmath12 and it is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the amplitude and @xmath15 is the angular frequency of the periodic magnetic field and @xmath16 stands for the time .    in the static case ( i.e. @xmath17 )",
    "the model turns to the iatm , which is equivalent to the four component potts model for @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath19 the model reduces to two independent ising models .",
    "we use a glauber - type stochastic process @xcite to investigate dynamic properties of the considered system . in general , in the glauber type of stochastic process ( as done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the ising model ) the thermal average ( denoted with @xmath20 ) of a spin variable @xmath21 , which can take values @xmath22 can be given as @xmath23 in this type of process .",
    "here , @xmath24 is the transition rate per unit time , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively .",

    "we can obtain dop as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a stable and periodic function .",
    "dynamical critical points can be determined by obtaining the variation of the @xmath49 with temperature for given set of hamiltonian parameters .",
    "we can construct the hysteresis loops which are nothing but the variation of the @xmath50 with @xmath12 in one period of the periodic magnetic field .",
    "hereafter , once the hysteresis loop is determined , some quantities about it can be calculated .",
    "one of them is dynamical hysteresis loop area ( hla ) and can be calculated via integration over a complete cycle of the magnetic field , @xmath51 and corresponds to the energy loss due to the hysteresis .",
    "in order to determine dpt and hysteresis characteristics of the system , let us scale all hamiltonian parameters with @xmath10 , i.e. the unit of energy is @xmath10 , @xmath52 our investigation will be restricted to square ( @xmath53 ) lattice .",
    "we set @xmath54 throughout our numerical calculations .",
    "we note that , under the transformation @xmath55 , hamiltonian and the formulation used here do not change , then it will be enough to investigate only one of the @xmath56 or @xmath57 , due to the fact that @xmath58 .",
    "different phases of the static model is well known :    * ferromagnetic ( baxter ) phase : all magnetizations are different from zero .",
    "* paramagnetic phase : all magnetizations are zero . * @xmath59 phases : all magnetizations are zero except the magnetization that have index which is the name of the phase .",
    "for instance in @xmath60 phase only @xmath56 is different from zero , while other two are equal to zero .",
    "we investigate corresponding dynamical phases in this work .",
    "three different dynamical phases ( corresponding to the phases of the static iatm ) will manifest themselves .",
    "also , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and successive works related to the dpt in ising model , some regions may appear in the phase diagram , which is overlap region of the dynamically ordered and disordered phases .",
    "this overlap region mostly occur for relatively large values of @xmath61 for the ising model .",
    "let us enumerate these phases with prefix dp ( which stands for dynamical phase ) .",
    "* dp1 : all dops are different from zero ( corresponds to the baxter phase in static the case ) * dp2 : all dops are equal to zero ( corresponds to the paramagnetic phase in static the case ) * dp3 : only @xmath62 is different from zero while @xmath63 ( corresponds to the @xmath64 phase in static the case ) * dp4 : overlap of the dp1 and dp2 ( or dp3 ) phases .    these phases and borders between them can be determined by calculating magnetizations defined in eq .",
    "( [ denk10 ] ) by using formulation presented in this work .",
    "typical time series corresponding to these four different phases can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sek1 ] .",
    "although the values of the magnetizations in the dp1 , dp2 and dp3 phases are not dependent on the initial values of the magnetizations , as one can see from to fig .",
    "[ sek1 ] ( b ) that , this does not hold for the dp4 phase .",
    "the value of the @xmath58 converges zero or specific nonzero values depending on the initial value . in other words , formulation gives two different values ( such that one of them is zero ) for @xmath58 depending on the choice of the initial values .",
    "the phase diagram for static iatm in @xmath65 plane can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ sek2 ] ) . this diagram can be obtained by numerical solutions of the eq .",
    "( [ denk11 ] ) in the static limit .",
    "the same phase diagram obtained within the rg @xcite and mc @xcite can be found in the literature . in the static iatm , for the higher values of the @xmath66 , @xmath64 phase may appear when the temperature rises , as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek2 ] .",
    "dynamic phase boundaries ( dpb ) of the model separate the different dynamic phases of the model .",
    "the relation of the dynamic behavior of the system with driving dynamical magnetic field is well known @xcite .",
    "the relation between the exchange interaction , temperature , amplitude and the frequency of the magnetic field determines the dynamic phase of the system .",
    "ferromagnetic exchange interaction of the model tends to to keep the nearest neighbors of the spins of the system parallel to each other .",
    "rising temperature gives rise to the thermal thermal fluctuations and drive the system to the disordered phases .",
    "besides , in the dynamical case , the amplitude and the frequency of the magnetic field are also decisive .",
    "higher amplitude , dictates the spins to align parallel to the field .",
    "but when the frequency is high , spins can not follow to magnetic field due to the difference between the period of the magnetic field and relaxation time of the spins .    in order to compare with the static case ,",
    "let us depict the phase diagrams in @xmath65 plane ( as in fig .",
    "[ sek2 ] ) for some selected values of @xmath15 and @xmath61 .",

    "[ sek3 ] for low frequency ( @xmath67 ) and in fig .",
    "[ sek4 ] for high frequency ( @xmath68 ) , with selected values of @xmath69 shown in figures labeled as ( a),(b),(c ) and ( d ) respectively .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek3 ] , at low frequencies , rising amplitude shrinks the @xmath70 region and shifts the @xmath71 region towards the higher temperature region of the @xmath65 plane .",
    "also disappearing of the @xmath72 phase with rising @xmath61 draws attention .",
    "the same reasoning holds for the high frequency regime , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ sek4 ] . for higher frequency the @xmath72",
    "phase survives in a larger interval of @xmath61 , e.g. while for the value of @xmath73 , high frequency has @xmath72 phase in @xmath65 plane ( fig .",
    "[ sek4 ] ( d ) ) , the same phase do nt occur for lower frequency ( fig .",
    "[ sek3 ] ( d ) ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to the behavior of the dynamical ising model as shown in @xcite .",
    "the hysteric response of the system to the varying temperature , frequency and amplitude of the driven field is well known from the investigations on the ising model @xcite .",
    "thus , in this section we especially want to discuss the effect of the coupling constant @xmath66 on these hysteresis characteristics .",
    "typical behaviors of the hysteresis loops with changing hamiltonian parameters can be seen in fig .",
    "if we group hysteresis loops ( as for the ising model ) as paramagnetic and ferromagnetic loops , we observe from fig .",
    "[ sek5 ] that , in the manner of transition between two kind of loops    * the effect of the rising temperature and amplitude of the field are similar , they give rise to transition from ferromagnetic loops to paramagnetic loops ( see fig .",
    "[ sek5 ] ( a ) and ( c ) ) * the effect of the rising frequency of the field and @xmath66 are similar , they give rise to transition from paramagnetic loops to ferromagnetic loops ( see fig . [ sek5 ] ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "rising temperature causes enhanced thermal fluctuations and the spins can follow the driving periodic magnetic field .",
    "the same reasoning holds for the rising amplitude of the field , since rising amplitude of the field means that more energy is supplied to the system from the magnetic field .",
    "these two mechanisms cause a transition from the ordered phase to the disordered phase .",
    "the reverse transition can be seen for the rising frequency of the field . after a specific frequency ( which depends on all other hamiltonian parameters )",
    ", spins can not follow the magnetic field , then ferromagnetic phase occurs .",
    "these facts have already been observed and explained for the dynamical ising model @xcite . for the iatm we observe from fig .",
    "[ sek5 ] ( d ) that rising @xmath66 can give rise to transition from the paramagnetic hysteresis loops to the ferromagnetic loops ( compare loops labeled by a , b , c in fig .",
    "[ sek5 ] ( d ) ) .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the dynamic phase diagram which was depicted in fig .",
    "[ sek3 ] ( d ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek3 ] ( d ) while system is in the @xmath74 phase for the temperature value of @xmath75 , rising coupling constant @xmath66 gives rise to a transition to the @xmath70 phase which has ferromagnetic hysteresis characteristics .",
    "note that there is not any significant difference between the observed hysteresis loops belonging to @xmath71 and @xmath74 phases .",
    "this is because both of the phases have @xmath76 .",
    "thus the phases @xmath71 and @xmath74 could not be distinguished by hysteresis behaviors of order parameter @xmath77 .",
    "but the variation of the @xmath78 with magnetic field in one period may distinguish between these two phases .",
    "this loop may be called as hysteresis loop of @xmath78 . in order to determine the response of this new order parameter ( which is absent in the ising model )",
    ", we depict typical loops representing the phases @xmath79 and @xmath70 in fig .",
    "the other hamiltonian parameter values are chosen as @xmath80 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ sek3 ] ( a ) that , the curve labeled a in fig .",
    "[ sek6 ] represents the hysteresis loop of the phase @xmath71 , b represents the phase @xmath74 and c and d correspond to the phase @xmath70 .",
    "first of all , the loop corresponds to the phase @xmath71 ( curve labeled by a ) indeed a @xmath81 line , means that the order parameter @xmath81 does not respond to the varying magnetic field . as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek6 ] , the order parameter @xmath62 starts to reply the changing magnetic field within the phase @xmath74 ( curve labeled b ) and similar loop is valid for the phase @xmath70 ( curve labeled c ) .",
    "but one difference draws our attention : while the loop belonging to the phase @xmath74 has one @xmath62 value for the zero field , the loop about the @xmath70 phase has two very close but slightly different values of @xmath62 for the @xmath82 case . when the temperature is lowered , the loop like knot becomes dissolved and evolve into the loops like labeled d in fig .",
    "[ sek6 ] . as a result",
    ", we can distinguish the phases @xmath83 and @xmath74 by looking at the hysteresis loops of the @xmath62 as explained above .",
    "lastly we want to elaborate the hla properties of the system .",
    "for this aim we depict the contour plots of the hla in ( @xmath84 ) plane for selected values of @xmath85 pair , which can be seen in fig .",
    "hla of the dynamical ising model has been widely inspected in the literature and the variation of the hla with the frequency is well known .",
    "we want to determine the relation between @xmath66 and the hla .",
    "this can be seen in contour plots for several cases . at first sight one difference",
    "is take our attention between the contour plots given in fig .",
    "[ sek7 ] ( a)-(d ) .",

    "[ sek7 ] ( a ) while the reverse relation holds in figs .",
    "[ sek7 ] ( b)-(d ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ sek3 ] ( d ) , rising @xmath66 give rise to transition from the phase @xmath74 to @xmath70 and this transition causes depressed hla .",
    "we can not face this situation in fig .",
    "[ sek7 ] ( b ) . for low frequencies , rising @xmath66 enhances the hla . again from fig .",
    "[ sek3 ] ( d ) , we can see that , this variation can not change the phase of the system , the system lies in the @xmath74 phase and rising coupling @xmath66 between the two ising models give rise to rising hla .",
    "same situation holds for figs .",
    "[ sek7 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the only difference is wider region of the @xmath86 plane has big hla due to the rising @xmath61 enlarges the region that have @xmath87 regions .",
    "the phase diagrams and the hysteresis characteristics of the iatm has been investigated within the mfa with glauber type of stochastic process .",
