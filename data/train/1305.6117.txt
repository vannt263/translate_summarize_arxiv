    "some time ago we suggested a new expression for the electromagnetic form factor of the pion @xmath0 @xcite , which describes the data on the reaction @xmath4 @xcite restricted to the time - like region @xmath14 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the expression takes into account the strong resonance mixing via common decay modes and the @xmath15 mixing .",
    "it has both the correct analytical properties and the normalization condition @xmath16 , and can be represented in the form :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) counts the @xmath20-like resonance states @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , ... , the quantity @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is introduced in such a way that @xmath26 is the @xmath27 transition amplitude , where @xmath28 is the electric charge . as usual ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath29 is calculated from the electronic width @xmath30 of the resonance @xmath31 .",
    "the quantities @xmath32 are the matrix elements of the matrix @xmath33 given by eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) below , and @xmath34 .",
    "ellipses mean additional states like @xmath13 etc .",
    "it is assumed that the direct g - parity - violating decay @xmath35 is absent , that is , @xmath36 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is responsible for the @xmath15 mixing .",

    "( [ fpi ] ) .",
    "we note that an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ fpi ] ) was used earlier @xcite for the description of data in the time - like domain , but it had a disadvantage in that the normalization condition @xmath16 was satisfied only within an accuracy of 20@xmath38 .    using the resonance parameters found from fitting the data @xcite , the continuation to the space - like region @xmath39 was made , and the curve describing the behavior of @xmath40 in the range @xmath41 gev@xmath2 was obtained @xcite and compared with the data @xcite in this interval of the momentum transfer squared .",
    "the space - like interval was further expanded to @xmath42 gev@xmath2 in a subsequent work @xcite , and a comparison was made with the data @xcite existing in that interval .",
    "the basic ingredient in the above treatment is the inclusion of the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( pp ) loops , specifically , the @xmath43 and @xmath44 ones .",
    "these contributions are dominant at the center - of - mass energy @xmath45 gev .",
    "going to higher energies ( up to 3 gev ) of the reaction @xmath4 @xcite - requires the inclusion of the vector - pseudoscalar ( vp ) and axial vector - pseudoscalar ( ap ) intermediate states .",
    "this is the aim of the present work .",
    "the particular vp state @xmath7 produced in @xmath9 annihilation was studied by the snd team in ref .",

    "an attempt to describe these reactions in the framework of the three - channel approach , taking into account the pp , vp , and ap intermediate states , is also undertaken in the present work . furthermore , a suitable scheme with three subtractions for the nondiagonal polarization operators is used in the present work as opposed to refs .",
    "@xcite where the scheme with two subtractions was used .",
    "of course , there are many works in the current literature devoted to analyzing of the pion form factor in models that are different from that proposed here and in refs .  @xcite . in particular , a model with a broken hidden local symmetry added to the @xmath43 and @xmath44 loops at energies @xmath47 gev was used in refs.@xcite , without attempting to extend the analysis to higher energies .",
    "a subtraction scheme different from ours was used there for the calculation of the pseudoscalar - loop contribution .",
    "the task of extending the energy region above 1 gev was undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the contributions of heavier rho - like resonances . however , the mixing among these resonances  necessarily arising due to their common decay modes  was not taken into account in that work .",
    "a model similar to the @xmath48-matrix approach but with improved analytical properties was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as opposed to the above works ,",
    "the present work uses the field - theory - inspired approach to the problem which takes into account relevant pp- , vp- , and ap - loop contributions and the strong mixing of the @xmath20-like resonances arising via their common decay modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "these states have rather large widths and are mixed via their common decay modes . the finite width and mixing effects",
    "are taken into account by means of the diagonal and nondiagonal polarization operators @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effects of finite width appear in the inverse propagator of the resonance @xmath51 via the replacement @xmath52 indeed , according to unitarity relation , the particular contribution to the imaginary part of the diagonal polarization operator is due to the real intermediate state @xmath53 : @xmath54 hereafter , the quantity @xmath55 is the energy squared .",

    "the fact is that the usage of @xmath216-dependent centrifugal barrier penetration factor in particle physics  for example , in the case of the @xmath10 meson @xcite , results in the overlooked problem .",

    "for example , in case of the @xmath97-wave scattering in the potential @xmath219 where the resonance scattering is possible , the background phase is @xmath220 at the usual value of @xmath221 fm , @xmath218 is not small .",

    "the main purpose of the present work is to describe the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath40 up to the @xmath243 energy range , using the expression obtained in ref .",
    "this expression , when restricted to the pp loops in polarization operators , permits a good description of the data of snd , cmd-2 , kloe , and @xmath3 on @xmath43 production in @xmath9 annihilation at @xmath224 gev , describes the scattering kinematical domain up to @xmath189 gev@xmath2 , and does not contradict the data on @xmath244 scattering phase @xmath223 .",
    "the goal of extending the description to the energies up to 3 gev in the time - like domain was reached by the inclusion of the vp- and ap - loops in addition to the pp ones .",
    "these loops contain the couplings of the @xmath20-like resonances with the vp- and ap - states and generate , in turn , the final states @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath9 annihilation .",
    "therefore , consistency demands the treatment of these final states as well . as is shown in the present work , the energy behavior of the cross sections of the reactions @xmath5 and @xmath6 obtained in the adopted simplified model , does not contradict the data .",
    "the statistically poor description of the cross section of the reaction @xmath6 is , probably , an artifact of the oversimplified model for its amplitude which ignores both the requirements of the chiral symmetry at lower energies and a complicated intermediate state at higher energies .",
    "the proper treatment of the reaction @xmath6 is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "nevertheless , we included this poor description for the consistency of the presentation .",
    "one should not wonder at the fact that the masses of heavier @xmath20-like resonances quoted in table [ table1 ] differ from the values quoted in ref .",
    "in fact , the values in ref .",
    "@xcite are only educated guesses , and the masses of heavier @xmath20-like resonances quoted by the particle data group fall into wide intervals ; for instance , @xmath245 mev , and @xmath246 mev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the quoted values are usually obtained from fitting the data with the help of the simplest parametrization such as the sum of the breit - wigner amplitudes . in the meantime",
    "it is known that the residues of the simple pole contributions not necessarily reveal the true nature of the resonances involved in the process @xcite when the mixings and the dynamical effects like the final - state interaction become essential .",
    "the real problem is that the continuation to the space - like domain of the expression for @xmath40 with the contributions of the vp and ap loops meets the difficulty of encountering the landau poles . by all appearances ,",
    "this is the consequence of the chosen parametrization of the vertex form factor which restricts the growth of the partial widths as the energy increase , in a modest way .",
    "a stronger suppression could effectively suppress the couplings of rho - like resonances with the vp and ap states and , in turn , push the landau zeros to higher space - like momentum transfers .",
