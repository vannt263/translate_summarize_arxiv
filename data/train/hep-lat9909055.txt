    "to understand the scale dependence of the ` higgs condensate ' @xmath1 let us define the @xmath2 theory in the presence of a lattice spacing @xmath3 .",
    "the basic problem is the relation between the bare `` lattice '' condensate @xmath4 and its renormalized physical value @xmath5 in the continuum limit @xmath6 .    in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking , there are two basically different definitions : @xmath7 from the propagator of the bare shifted ` higgs ' field @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the rescaling of @xmath12 needed in the effective potential @xmath13 @xmath14 to match the quadratic shape at its absolute minima with the higgs mass .",
    "the usual assumption @xmath15 is equivalent to require a smooth limit @xmath16 .",
    "this is not necessarily true in the presence of bose condensation phenomena @xcite where one can have a very large particle density at zero - momentum that compensates for the vanishing strength @xmath17 of the elementary two - body processes . in this case",
    ", one can have trivially free fluctuations so that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , but a non - trivial effective potential with a divergent @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the bare ratio @xmath21 consistently with the rigorous results of euclidean field theory  @xcite but @xmath22 remains finite and can not be used to constrain the magnitude of @xmath23 .",
    "the one - component @xmath24 theory becomes in the ising limit @xmath25\\ ] ] with @xmath26 and where @xmath27 takes only the values@xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "we performed monte - carlo simulations of this ising action using the swendsen - wang cluster algorithm .",
    "lattice observables include : the bare magnetization @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average field for each lattice configuration ) , the zero - momentum susceptibility @xmath32 $ ] , the shifted - field propagator @xmath33 where @xmath34 with @xmath35 being a vector with integer - valued components , not all zero .",
    "when approaching the continuum limit , one can compare the lattice data for @xmath36 to the 2-parameter formula @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the dimensionless lattice mass and @xmath39 . actually , if `` triviality '' is true , there must be a region of momenta where eq.([gpform ] ) gives a good description of the lattice data and can be used to define the mass . however , since the determination of the mass is a crucial issue , it is worth to compare the results of the previous method with the determination in terms of `` time - slice '' variables  @xcite . to this end",
    "let us consider a lattice with 3-dimension @xmath40 and temporal dimension @xmath41 and the two - point correlator @xmath42 .",
    "in this way , parameterizing the correlator @xmath43 in terms of the energy @xmath44 , the mass can be determined through the lattice dispersion relation  @xcite @xmath45",
    "as a check of our simulations we started our analysis at @xmath46 in the symmetric phase , where the high - statistics results by montvay & weisz  @xcite are available .",
    "1 displays the data for the scalar propagator suitably re - scaled in order to show the very good quality of the fit eq .",
    "( [ gpform ] ) .",
    "the 2-parameter fit gives @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the value at zero - momentum is defined as @xmath49 .",
    "notice the perfect agreement between @xmath11 and @xmath50 .",
    "we measure also the time - slice mass eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) at several values of the 3-momentum .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the corresponding result of montvay & weisz  @xcite and with the value @xmath51 obtained from the fit to the propagator data .     in the symmetric phase .",
    "the zero - momentum full point is defined as @xmath52 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the value of @xmath53.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in conclusion our analysis of the symmetric phase is in good agreement with ref .   and supports , to high accuracy , the usual identifications @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that our result for @xmath50 is in excellent agreement with the 1-loop renormalization group prediction  @xcite @xmath56 .",
    "we now choose for @xmath57 three successive values , @xmath58 , lying just above the critical @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "thus , we are in the broken phase and approaching the continuum limit where the correlation length @xmath60 becomes much larger than the lattice spacing . to be confident that finite - size effects are sufficiently under control , we used a lattice size , @xmath61 , large enough so that @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we checked that or results for the magnetization and the susceptibility at @xmath63 are in excellent agreement with the corresponding results of jansen _ et al _",
    "typical data for the re - scaled propagator are reported in fig .",
    "unlike fig .  1 , the fit to eq .",
    "( [ gpform ] ) , though excellent at higher momenta , does not reproduce the lattice data down to zero - momentum . therefore",
    ", in the broken phase , a meaningful determination of @xmath50 and @xmath38 requires excluding the lowest - momentum points from the fit .",
    "the fitted @xmath50 is slightly less than one .",
    "this fact is attributable to residual interactions since we are not exactly at the continuum limit , so that the theory is not yet completely `` trivial . ''",
    "this explanation is reasonable since we see a tendency for @xmath50 to approach unity as we get closer to the continuum limit .",
    "moreover , we find good agreement between our result , @xmath64 , and the lscher - weisz perturbative prediction @xmath65  @xcite at @xmath66 .",
    "the comparison @xmath67 with @xmath68 at @xmath69 is also fairly good . the quantity @xmath70 is obtained from the product @xmath71 and is shown in fig",
    ".  3 . according to conventional ideas @xmath70 should be _ the same _ as the wavefunction - renormalization constant , @xmath50 , but clearly it is significantly larger .",
    "note that there was no such discrepancy in fig .  1 for the symmetric phase .",
    "moreover our data show that the discrepancy gets _",
    "worse _ as we approach the critical @xmath57 . indeed fig .",
    "3 shows that @xmath70 grows rapidly as one approaches the continuum limit ( where @xmath72 ) .",
    "thus , the effect can not be explained by residual perturbative @xmath73 effects that might cause @xmath36 to deviate from the form in eq.([gpform ] ) ; such effects die out in the continuum limit , according to `` triviality . ''",
    "the results accord well with the `` two @xmath74 '' picture @xcite in which , as we approach the continuum limit , we expect to see the zero - momentum point , @xmath75 , become higher and higher .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     and @xmath11 as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "( the continuum limit corresponds to @xmath72.),scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we have reported new numerical evidence that the re - scaling of the ` higgs condensate ' @xmath77 is different from the conventional wavefunction renormalization @xmath7 .",
    "perturbatively , such a difference might be explicable if it became smaller and smaller when taking the continuum limit @xmath78 .",
    "however , our lattice data shows that the difference gets _",
    "larger _ as one gets closer to the continuum limit , @xmath72 .",
    "our lattice data is consistent with the unconventional picture @xcite of `` triviality '' and spontaneous symmetry breaking in which @xmath70 diverges logarithmically , while @xmath18 in the continuum limit . in this picture",
    "the higgs mass @xmath79 can remain finite in units of the fermi - constant scale @xmath80 , even though the ratio @xmath81 .",
    "the higgs mass is then a genuine collective effect and @xmath82 is _ not _ proportional to the renormalized self - interaction strength .",
    "if so , then the whole subject of higgs mass limits is affected .",
