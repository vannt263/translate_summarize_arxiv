    "astronomical images obtained form the ground suffer from serious degradation of resolution , because the light passes through a turbulent medium ( the atmosphere )  @xcite before reaching the detector .",
    "a number of methods was developed to alleviate this phenomenon  @xcite and multiple special - case solutions were implemented as well ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but none of them is able to provide a perfect correction and restore the diffraction - limited ( dl ) image .",
    "therefore , the best observatories , in terms of angular resolution , are the spaceborne ones , since they are limited only by the dl .",
    "recently , there is an increasing interest in the attempts to overcome the dl boundary .",
    "devices which can give such possibility are called the quantum telescopes ( qt ) .",
    "first qts will probably work in the uv , optical and ir bands , mainly because of the speed , maturity and reliability of the detectors .",
    "latest progress in adaptive optics ( ao ) , especially so called extreme ao , makes the use of qts realistic also in ground - based observatories  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "the general idea of quantum telescopes is considered . in particular",
    "we refer to the setup proposed by  @xcite , since , to our knowledge , it is the only existing detailed description of a qt . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qtscheme ] we propose an upgraded version of this setup . according to  @xcite , each photon coming from the extended source triggers a signal by qnd detection and gets cloned  @xcite . the coincidence detector controlled by the trigger",
    "is turned on for a short period  @xcite and registers the clones .",
    "after that it is quickly turned off , so that it receives only a small fraction of spontaneous emission from the cloning medium and virtually no clones from other photons . if the source is too bright and emits too many photons per unit of time , a gray filter should be installed . as a result , a set of clones is produced and registered .",
    "the centroid position of the clones cloud is used to add 1 adu . ] at the corresponding position of the high resolution output image .",
    "the exposure time has to be much longer than in classic telescopes ( ct ) , since ( a ) in most cases a narrowband filter has to be applied and ( b ) the qnd detection efficiency is much below 100%  @xcite .",
    "below we present the results of our detailed simulations of the qt system , discuss the feasibility of building such a device and predict its expected performance . to our knowledge , this is the first paper describing the detailed simulations of a qt of any design , as this is a preliminary concept .    in our simulations as input images we used parts of real images obtained by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "such images are optimal for the purpose of qt testing because this observatory is working at its dl . we cropped and decimated them to 200@xmath0200 pixels to speed up the computations .",
    "for the comparison , we also simulated the process of digital image formation in the case of a ct ( for a review on high angular resolution imaging see  @xcite ) using the same images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obscuredpupil]e ) .",
    "we assumed a real telescope for which the pupil is obscured by a secondary mirror and its truss (  spider  )  @xcite .",
    "we assumed a similar size of a secondary mirror and truss as it is installed on the hst  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obscuredpupil]a ) .    in the case of a ct , we sampled the counts ( photons ) from the original image  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obscuredpupil]d ) and distributed them according to the airy diffraction pattern decimated to 61x61 pixels  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obscuredpupil]b ) . for the simulation of a qt",
    ", each photon from the reference image was converted to @xmath1 cloned photons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obscuredpupil]c ) .",
    "for @xmath1 we assumed the poissonian distribution .",
    "the clones were arranged using the gaussian profile ( see  @xcite fig .  2 therein for justification ; we assumed @xmath2 = 10 ) centered around the photon s position . to include the effects of spontaneous emission",
    ", on the top of it we added counts distributed equally within the coincidence detector plane and governed by the poissonian distribution .",
    "the mean noise level was tuned to achieve a given signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ; see exemplary simulated exposure in  fig .",
    "[ fig : drawing]b ) .",
    "the assessment of the snr was based on the comparison of the number of cloned photons with the number of counts originating from the spontaneous emission within the circular aperture of 3@xmath2 radius ( i.e. within the aperture , for which nearly all the clones are received ) .",
    "it follows the approach of snr derivation presented in  @xcite .    in the next stage of simulations of the qt image formation , we computed the centroid of clones employing the matched filtering approach .",
    "as the cloned photons exhibit gaussian spatial distribution  @xcite , in our calculations the image registered on the coincidence detector was first convolved with the gaussian ( @xmath2 = 10 ) and then the centroid was obtained from the position of the maximum value of such a filtered image  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : drawing]c ) .",
    "@xmath3 = @xmath4(@xmath5,@xmath6 )  ) generate @xmath7 generate @xmath1 clones in the @xmath7 around ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) compute @xmath8 paste @xmath8 to @xmath9(@xmath5,@xmath6 )    we ran the simulations for different numbers of clones , reaching also very high numbers ( up to the expected value of ~10k , see  @xcite for justification ) .",
    "the mean level of the poissonian noise of spontaneous emission was set so that snr was : 3/1 , 2/1 , 1 , 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , 1/5 , 1/6 , 1/7 , 1/8 , 1/9 , 1/10 , 1/11 , 1/12 , 1/13 and 1/14 .",
    "such a selection of snr includesa value of 1/7.3 which was assessed for qt in  @xcite .",
    "the quality of the simulated qt outcomes was assessed by two indicators : peak signal - to - noise ratio ( psnr ) and mean centroid error ( rms value ) . for 16-bit pixel representation",
    "the psnr measure is defined as follows :    @xmath10    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes the intensity of pixel at ( @xmath14 ) in respectively qt simulated image and reference high - fidelity image .",
    "the psnr and the mean centroid errors are depicted in fig .  [ fig : surfs ] .",
    "the place where both dependencies meet each other was retrieved and presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : betterworse ] .",
    "it shows the minimal requirements for the clones number and the snr level , which should be satisfied to achieve the resolution enhancement in qt .",
    "this curve can be treated as a first guidance for selection of qt parameters . as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : surfs ] and [ fig : betterworse ] , assuming snr @xmath15 7.3 , in average @xmath1657 clones per 1 detected photon are necessary to produce an image sharper than ct .",
    "for @xmath1710k clones the image is virtually ideally restored , even for the lowest values of snrs .",
    "the noticeable improvement of the outcome with higher clones count is related to the generally better estimation of the centroid when using the mf approach .",
    "for very small number of clones , the photons distribution is dominated by isolated photon - detection events and the mf output is strongly dependent on actual arrangement of registered clones .",
    "in contrast , for higher numbers of clones , the gaussian becomes more uniform and therefore , the mf provides much more reliable estimations even if the snr remains the same . in fig .",
    "[ fig : outputimages ] we show exemplary resulting qt images for various snrs and clones counts .",
    "the improvement in the image quality is easily noticeable as both parameters increase .",
    "below we summarize and discuss the feasibility of the qts as emerging from the most recent literature . a constant progress in the qnd increases the qt feasibility .",
    "there remains a possibility that some other kind of discriminator of spontaneous emission will be found .",
    "possibly qnd does not require to hold the photon in a resonant cavity for several hundreds microseconds , as it was claimed before  @xcite . according to  @xcite , in the case of the cavity - free qnd the photons momentum change is also negligible .",
    "however , this setup is suspected to produce false detections ( < 5% ) and can not be miniaturized .",
    "authors are presently working on a version easier to miniaturize ( keyu xia priv . com . ) .",
    "we see no strong limitations for the size of the device if it could be placed e.g. at the  ` cassegrain `  or   ` coud `  plane optically conjugated to the pupil plane of the optical system near the focus  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : focus ] ) .",
    "another technological issue concerning the qt is the spontaneous emission from the process of cloning ( for details see  @xcite ) .",
    "as we showed , in our model , for a sufficiently large number of clones this problem could be overcome .",
    "however , in the general case of the qt some more sophisticated methods might be needed ( e.g. different geometrical setup or filters ) .",
    "given the recent progress in cloning , it might also become possible to clone photons from a wider wavelength span and at a greater amount  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the general idea of the quantum telescopes seems feasible and in the near future it might be possible to construct a technology demonstrator . in this paper we presented the updated schematic `` toy model '' of a qt system and the first quantitative results of simulations of such an imager , aiming at predicting the conditions which would guarantee its optimal performance .",
    "we found that it is generally more important to provide more clones than to reduce the noise background .",
    "given the predicted snr = 7.3 , a satisfactory results are obtained from less than 60 clones . using 10k clones ,",
    "the signal is almost perfectly restored for any noise level .",
    "we encourage the interest and discussion on the idea of the qt , since even a small increase in the resolution might lead to a major breakthrough in astronomical imaging .    * funding . *",
