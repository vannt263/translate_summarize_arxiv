    "the seminal proposals for doppler cooling in 1975 @xcite prompted the realization of the first optical molasses in the 1980 s @xcite , a major landmark in the field of laser cooling and trapping of atoms @xcite .",
    "the physical concepts behind the doppler cooling mechanism are both simple and elegant , and predict the achievement of very low temperatures .",
    "they remain to this day the starting point of most courses on laser cooling and degenerate gases @xcite .",
    "it is thus ironic that not only , to our knowledge , quantitative predictions of this simple model have not been experimentally validated , but moreover , experimental studies have found results quantitatively and even qualitatively different from the predictions of the model @xcite .    today",
    ", it is well known that for most atoms with a degenerate ground state manifold , the complex multi - level structure gives rise to new mechanisms which come to dominate the cooling process , yielding ultimate temperatures far below those predicted by doppler theory @xcite .",
    "accounting for these sub - doppler mechanisms allows one to understand the qualitative and quantitative experimental observations .",
    "in contrast , three - dimensional laser cooling of an atomic sample in agreement with the celebrated doppler model is still lacking @xcite .",
    "recent work with alkaline - earth and rare - earth atoms , which exhibit a non - degenerate ground state , have provided natural candidates to study cooling in a purely doppler regime . yet , to our knowledge , all experiments with these atoms have found temperatures above the expected doppler limit in magneto - optical traps ( mots ) @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy has been attributed to the presence of additional heating mechanism @xcite .    here",
    "we report the three - dimensional laser cooling of metastable helium-4 gases in the doppler regime .",
    "we monitor the temperature of the gas as a function of the laser detuning @xmath2 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dopplermot - mol ] , finding excellent agreement with doppler theory .",
    "the temperature reaches a minimum for a detuning @xmath3 ( where @xmath1 is the transition linewidth ) , while increasing with @xmath4 , in contrast with sub - doppler molasses .",
    "in addition , the drift velocities of optical molasses with unbalanced power between counter - propagating beams are far larger than those expected of sub - doppler molasses @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath5 transition of helium-4 , which allows in principle for sub - doppler cooling , and yet our results show no evidence for such effects . we present a physical argument showing that the special properties of metastable helium ( @xmath6he * ) strongly inhibit sub - doppler cooling in the experimental configuration we probe .",
    "laser cooling of an atomic gas relies upon the exchange of momentum between the atoms and the near - resonant light field , resulting in a mechanical force @xmath7 on the atoms . for small velocities ,",
    "the equilibrium temperature @xmath8 of these cooling schemes is given by the ratio of a momentum - space diffusion constant @xmath9 ( given by the fluctuations of the force ) to the velocity - damping coefficient @xmath10 . in the following",
    "we will first recall the main theoretical results for laser doppler cooling of a two - level atom , then proceeding to discuss a multi - level atom where sub - doppler mechanisms may appear .",
    "the mechanical interaction of a near - resonant light beam ( frequency @xmath11 ) with a two - level atom ( atomic resonance frequency @xmath12 ) is dominated by the radiation pressure effect and its associated force @xcite .",
    "this light - matter interaction is characterised by the laser detuning from resonance @xmath13 , the laser intensity @xmath14 , the natural linewidth of the transition @xmath1 , and the saturation intensity of the transition @xmath15 .",
    "a convenient physical quantity is the generalized saturation parameter @xmath16 which characterizes the excited state population in a 2-level atom . here",
    "@xmath17 is the on - resonance saturation parameter , and @xmath18 is the rabi frequency .    at low saturation of the atomic transition @xmath19 and small velocities",
    "@xmath20 , the average force acting on a two - level atom moving at velocity @xmath21 takes the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the photon wavevector , and @xmath25 the reduced planck s constant . the force @xmath26 is plotted in figure  [ fig : compforces ] ( dashed line ) for the typical experimental parameters of optical molasses .    calculating the diffusion constant @xmath27 for the two - level atom ,",
    "one can obtain the equilibrium temperature @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "following the generalization to cooling in 3d @xcite , the temperature of a 3d molasses formed by three orthogonal pairs of counter - propagating laser beams is , @xmath30 where the @xmath31 is the total intensity resulting from all six laser beams . in the doppler regime ,",
    "the minimum possible temperature is achieved for a detuning @xmath32 and vanishing intensity .",
    "this minimum is commonly referred to as the doppler limit , @xmath33 .",
    "we now turn the discussion to an atom with several ground - state levels where sub - doppler mechanisms of cooling may be involved @xcite . for this discussion",
    "we restrict ourselves to the atomic structure of the @xmath6he * atom on the @xmath5 transition ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : compforces]a ) , and the laser configuration used in the experiment : counter - propagating laser beams with opposite circular polarization ( configuration @xmath34 ) along three orthogonal axes .",
    "consider first a single axis of the system .",
    "following the derivation from @xcite an explicit formulation of the semi - classical force @xmath7 on a moving atom can be obtained .",
    "this approach takes into account atomic coherence effects up to second - order in absorption - emission processes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compforces ] we plot this force @xmath7 along with that exerted on a two - level atom @xmath35 . in the low - velocity region",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compforces]c ) the cooling force on the multi - level atom exhibits a sharp feature with an associated damping coefficient @xmath10 significantly larger than that of a two - level atom .",
    "this feature arises from the presence of atomic coherences and two - photon processes , and is the signature of sub - doppler cooling mechanisms .",
    "since the momentum - space diffusion coefficient hardly changes , the new damping coefficient would lead one to expect sub - doppler cooling .    in this configuration , the additional cooling results from a motion - induced population difference between the ground - state levels , and is referred to as @xmath34 polarization gradient cooling . in a 3d configuration , it is well known that sisyphus cooling can also occur due to spatially dependent light shifts of the atomic ground - state levels .",
    "the electric field from laser beams along orthogonal axes interfere , resulting in a modulation of the intensity , which in turn may lead to sisyphus cooling as in a one - dimensional lin @xmath36 lin configuration . within the parameter range of interest ( @xmath37 )",
    ", both sub - doppler effects result in similar velocity capture ranges and equilibrium temperatures @xcite .",
    "the comparison between a 2-level and a multi - level atom presented in fig .  [ fig : compforces ] suggests two important conclusions . on the one hand",
    "the two - photon structure occurs only in a small range close to zero velocity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : compforces]c ) .",
    "in particular , for typical experimental parameters with helium-4 atoms this velocity range is smaller than the recoil velocity @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the particle s mass .",
    "this implies that sub - doppler cooling is highly ineffective in a red molasses of @xmath6he * since the velocity capture range for such processes is much smaller than the lowest velocity achievable through doppler cooling . on the other hand , on a larger velocity range corresponding to doppler velocities",
    "the friction coefficient for the multi - level atom is close to that of an effective two - level atom . in the following section",
    ", we will study the sub - doppler capture velocity range in greater detail , showing that indeed @xmath6he * occupies a special place in the study of laser cooling mechanisms .",
    "the velocity capture range for doppler cooling is @xmath40 , directly reflecting the largest doppler effect that can be compensated with a detuning @xmath2 from resonance .",
    "similarly , the capture range for sub - doppler cooling reflects the new physical mechanisms involved . for sisyphus cooling ( lin @xmath36 lin ) to be effective , a ground - state atom should have a high probability of being optically pumped into a different ground - state atom on a wavelength distance @xcite . in the semi - classical regime , this yields a condition on the atomic velocity @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the optical pumping rate from one ground - state level to another ground - state level .",
    "the capture velocity is thus estimated to be @xmath43 . in the case of @xmath34 polarization gradient cooling , the capture velocity is given by the pumping rate at small detunings @xmath44 , @xmath45 @xcite , while it is set by the light shift @xmath46 of the ground - state levels at large detuning @xmath47 , and is defined in the same way to be @xmath48 , @xcite .",
    "the optical pumping rate and the light shift can be expressed conveniently as @xcite    @xmath49    a large capture velocity range for sub - doppler cooling requires a large @xmath42 and/or @xmath46 .",
    "these two quantities are decreasing functions of the detuning @xmath2 when @xmath50 and @xmath46 is maximum for @xmath51 . the doppler temperature ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tdoppler ] ) is minimum in the same range of detuning @xmath2 . in the following ,",
    "we will therefore concentrate on laser detuning @xmath4 of the order of @xmath1 , the most favorable situation to observe signatures of sub - doppler cooling ( although not the lowest temperature ) .",
    "the capture velocities for both sub - doppler mechanisms are then of the same order , @xmath52    for the parameters represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : compforces ] ( @xmath53 ) and using eq .",
    "[ eq : vcapture ] , we find @xmath54 in agreement with the numerical calculation of the force shown in fig .  [",

    ", we find @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the temperature associated with the recoil energy @xmath60 .",
    "the capture velocity for sub - doppler cooling is proportional to @xmath1 ( via @xmath55 ) and the square - root of the ratio @xmath61 .",
    "both these quantities are small in the case of @xmath6he * as compared to other species . in the table [ tablecomptc ]",
    "we present a comparison of the ratio @xmath61 for several atomic species commonly used in laser - cooling experiments .",
    ".ratio @xmath61 and estimated maximum capture velocity @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) for several commonly laser - cooled atoms . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     eq .",
    "[ eq : capturefraction ] indicates that the capture velocity @xmath64 increases with saturation parameter @xmath65 , approaching the limit @xmath66 .",
    "however , @xmath65 can not be increased arbitrarily .",
    "for red - detuned optical molasses , the friction coefficient @xmath10 is known to change sign at large saturation parameter @xcite .",
    "this change of sign occurs when the contribution of multi - photon processes to the force becomes large enough to modify the excited state decay rate , and typically occurs at @xmath67 .",
    "supposing a maximum saturation parameter @xmath63 , we estimate an upper limit on the capture velocity @xmath68 .",
    "the values for @xmath68 are given in table  [ tablecomptc ] .",
    "it is clear that helium , and to a lesser extent lithium , is special with respect to other alkali atoms since the capture range for sub - doppler cooling is smaller than the range of velocities achievable with doppler cooling .",
    "this statement applies both to the @xmath34 and lin @xmath36 lin configurations .",
    "thus we conclude that sub - doppler cooling is not expected to play a role on the @xmath69 transition of helium-4 .",
    "indeed , in the experiment we do not observe any signatures of sub - doppler cooling .",
    "the semi - classical arguments we have presented above highlight the special place that helium occupies among laser cooled species .",
    "a precise and quantitative condition for the appearance of efficient sub - doppler cooling would require a fully quantum , three - dimensional computation and is beyond the scope of this paper .      from the above arguments , sub - doppler effects on metastable helium on the @xmath5 transition",
    "are expected to be negligible .",
    "we will therefore compare the temperature measurements in 3d gases to the predictions of doppler theory @xcite . to account for the multi - level atomic structure in the 3d doppler theory",
    "we take a weighted sum over all possible one - photon transitions , where the weights are given by the square of the clebsch - gordan coefficients ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compforces]a ) .",
    "this leads to a rescaling of the saturation intensity @xmath70 , and an equilbrium temperature @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the total intensity in the 6 beams .",
    "a similar approach has been used in @xcite .",
    "our measurements are performed with an apparatus which cools and traps metastable helium atoms in a mot . @xmath6he",
    "* atoms are produced in a hot plasma ( dc - discharge ) and slowed down to trappable velocities on the order of several tens of meters per second with a @xmath73 m long zeeman slower .",
    "the slowed atoms enter the science chamber where three orthogonal pairs of counter - propagating laser beams are shone onto the atoms in the presence of a quadrupole magnetic field .",
    "the cooling light , which addresses the @xmath69 transition , is derived from a koheras adjustik y10 fiber laser from nkt photonics with a manufacturer stated linewidth @xmath74 khz . during the mot phase ,",
    "the typical intensity per beam is @xmath75 at a detuning @xmath76mhz @xmath77 from the atomic transition , where the transition linewidth is @xmath78mhz .",
    "the magnetic field gradient along the coil axis is @xmath79 g / cm . under these conditions , @xmath80 atoms at a temperature of @xmath81 mk are loaded within 2 seconds .",
    "detection of the gas is performed using a thermoelectrically cooled ingaas camera ( xeva type from xenics company ",
    "@xmath82 pixels with a pixel size of @xmath83 m ) .",
    "this technology is suited to image metastable helium atoms with a quantum efficiency of @xmath84% at 1083 nm .",
    "the camera collects the fluorescence of the atoms from the probe beams .",
    "the latter are made of the six beams we use to make a mot which are tuned onto resonance of the atomic transition during the imaging pulse .",
    "the duration of the imaging pulse is 100 @xmath85s and the total intensity is about 175 @xmath15 , where @xmath86 mw/@xmath87 is the saturation intensity of the @xmath88 cycling transition .",
    "sizes and temperature of the @xmath6he * clouds are extracted by monitoring the time - of - flight expansion of the initially trapped gases and fitting the imaged 2d density profiles with a gaussian function .",
    "after the mot phase we implement an optical molasses on the @xmath5 transition , as we shall now describe . at the end of the mot phase we ramp the magnetic field gradient to zero and ramp both the detuning and intensity of the laser beams from the mot values to those of the molasses within 20 ms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eqtime]a ) .",
    "this ramp of the parameters allows us to capture and cool half of the atoms ( @xmath89 ) in the molasses .",
    "the polarization of the light beams during the molasses stage is identical to that of the mot .",
    "we then wait for a variable time @xmath90 at fixed final intensity and detuning of the laser beams to reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "we monitor the time - of - flight expansion of the optical molasses cloud to extract its temperature .",

    "we observe a minimum temperature at a detuning @xmath32 as predicted by doppler cooling theory .",
    "the minimum measured temperature @xmath91 @xmath56 is close to the expected doppler limit , which occurs for vanishingly small light intensity .",
    "in addition we compare our temperature measurements to the doppler prediction of eq .",
    "[ eq : tdoppler ] and we find excellent agreement over the entire range of detunings studied in the experiment . for the high - temperature measurements ,",

    "the low - temperature measurements are performed on an optical molasses ( see figs .  [",

    "we have observed that the equilibration time can vary drastically in the presence of uncompensated bias magnetic fields and power imbalances between counter - propagating beams . as we will see in section  [ ssec : driftvelocity ] , the equilibirum molasses state is also very sensitive to such technical issues .    in doppler theory , the timescale to reach the equilibrium temperature",
