    "let @xmath1 be a smooth projective curve of genus @xmath0 defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a line bundle on @xmath1 with space of sections @xmath4 of dimension @xmath5 , then evaluation of sections defines a morphism @xmath6 .",
    "these morphisms yield much information about the geometry of @xmath1 , in particular about the possible projective embeddings of @xmath1 and the syzygies resulting from such embeddings .",
    "it is therefore important to obtain precise upper bounds on @xmath7 in terms of the degree of @xmath3 .",
    "these upper bounds depend on the curve , not just on the value of @xmath8 , and a first measure of the possible bounds is given by the clifford index of @xmath1 , whose definition runs as follows .",
    "we consider line bundles @xmath3 on @xmath1 and define the _ clifford index _",
    "@xmath9 of @xmath1 by @xmath10 or equivalently @xmath11 ( the equivalence of the two definitions follows from serre duality .",
    "the reason for requiring @xmath0 is to ensure the existence of line bundles as in the definition . )",
    "it is natural to generalise this to higher rank and in particular to semistable ( or stable ) vector bundles .",
    "the restriction to semistable bundles is natural as it allows for restrictions on the dimension of the space of sections essentially identical to those which exist for line bundles . in particular clifford s theorem",
    "has been extended to semistable bundles ; the simplest proof of this is due to g. xiao and appears as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) .",
    "semistable bundles also arise naturally in the study of syzygies in connection with conjectures of green and lazarsfeld @xcite ( in this context , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover the moduli spaces of semistable bundles are objects of interest in their own right .",
    "we may note that the existence of semistable bundles with specified numbers of sections has recently been used in two papers @xcite which obtain new information on the base locus of the generalised theta - divisor ; the first of these papers extends results of arcara @xcite , popa @xcite and schneider @xcite , while the second uses also the strange duality theorem , recently proved in @xcite .",
    "a key rle in some of these papers is played by the evaluation sequence @xmath12 where @xmath3 is a line bundle generated by its sections . for our purposes the key issue is the stability of @xmath13 , which was proved for @xmath14 in @xcite and for @xmath15 by ein and lazarsfeld @xcite .",
    "subsequently david butler @xcite considered more generally the sequence @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a vector bundle and @xmath18 is a linear subspace of @xmath19 which generates @xmath17 .",
    "( the construction of has come to be known as the _ dual span construction_. ) butler showed ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.2 ) that , if @xmath20 and @xmath17 is semistable ( stable ) of slope @xmath21 , then @xmath22 is semistable ( stable ) with a minor exception in the case of stability when the slope is equal to @xmath23 .",
    "results for line bundles of smaller degree have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "there is an important conjecture of butler ( which we discuss briefly in the final section ) that the bundles @xmath22 are semistable `` in general '' .",
    "the brill - noether locus @xmath24 in the moduli space of stable bundles of rank @xmath25 and degree @xmath26 on @xmath1 is comprised of those bundles @xmath17 for which @xmath27 .",
    "these loci have been studied for around 20 years and a good deal is known about their non - emptiness . however almost all the results are either true for any @xmath1 @xcite or for general @xmath1 only @xcite .",
    "precise results are known for hyperelliptic curves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) and for bielliptic curves @xcite but little has been done on other special curves .",
    "the main exceptions to this are papers of r. re @xcite and v. mercat @xcite and a recent paper by l. brambila - paz and a. ortega @xcite .",
    "these papers use only the classical clifford index @xmath9 which is defined using line bundles , although in many respects @xcite is the staring point for our investigations .    in @xcite ,",
    "e. ballico gave five definitions of clifford indices for vector bundles but did not develop the concept to any significant extent .",
    "we give two definitions , both using semistable bundles ( whereas ballico used indecomposable and stable bundles ) .",
    "our definitions differ from those of ballico in other respects as well , in that we do not assume that our bundles are generated by their sections ( although in fact most of our examples are so generated ) and we consider only bundles whose slope is at most @xmath28 ( whereas ballico requires only that @xmath29 ) .",
    "in fact we define , for any vector bundle @xmath17 of rank @xmath30 and degree @xmath26 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "( ballico defines @xmath33 in the same way but without the scaling factor @xmath34 . )",
    "we then define @xmath35 to be the minimum value of @xmath36 for semistable bundles @xmath17 of rank @xmath25 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "our second index @xmath39 is defined similarly , but with @xmath40 . for line bundles ,",
    "the two definitions coincide and reduce to the classical clifford index .",
    "the use of semistable , rather than stable , bundles is likely to give better specialisation properties , although the question of clifford indices for stable bundles is also of interest and will undoubtedly be investigated further in the future .",
    "it may be noted that there are results in the literature giving bounds on @xmath41 for indecomposable bundles @xcite and also for bundles of rank @xmath42 @xcite in terms of degrees of stability , but , for the reasons stated earlier , we feel that semistable bundles form the most natural context for these ideas .",
    "another natural question to ask is why we use at least @xmath43 independent sections for the definition of @xmath35 .",
    "the first reason is that the question of non - emptiness of brill - noether loci has been completely solved for @xmath44 ( see @xcite ) and depends only on the genus of @xmath1 .",
    "more fundamentally , the existence of semistable bundles with @xmath37 is closely linked with the non - emptiness of certain quot schemes and the existence of stable maps from @xmath1 to a grassmannian ( see @xcite ) , both of which have implications for the geometry of @xmath1 .",
    "we now summarise the contents of the paper . in section 2 , we give the definitions of @xmath35 and @xmath45 and obtain some elementary properties . in section 3 , we relate our invariants to the conjecture of mercat , which is a strengthened version of the assertion that @xmath46 .",
    "we then make some deductions from the results of @xcite , including an almost complete determination of the values of @xmath35 for @xmath47 ( theorem [ thm3.5 ] ) .",
    "section 4 is the central section of the paper . in it , we introduce the invariants @xmath48 which form the _ gonality sequence _ of @xmath1 ; these invariants play an important rle in the theory of special curves and are completely known in many cases .",
    "we describe the properties of these invariants which we need later in the paper .",
    "we then introduce the dual span construction .",
    "we verify butler s conjecture in the case of line bundles of degree @xmath49 under certain conditions on the gonality sequence ( proposition [ prop5.1 ] ) .",

    "* theorem 1.2 ) butler proved for any @xmath1 and any semistable @xmath17 that @xmath22 is semistable if @xmath861 .",
    "there are many similar results in the literature ( a summary of the current state of knowledge for the case where @xmath1 is general and @xmath17 is a line bundle may be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 9 ) ) .",
    "our proposition [ prop5.1 ] is a further example where @xmath1 is not required to be general .",
    "a solution of this conjecture would be interesting not only in its own right but because the bundles @xmath22 are related to syzygies and to picard bundles ( see in particular @xcite , where it is shown that , for sufficiently large degree , the bundle @xmath862 is , up to twisting by a line bundle , the restriction of a picard bundle to the curve @xmath1 embedded in the relevant moduli space ) .",
    "a further observation is that , if we use to map @xmath1 to the grassmannian @xmath863 of @xmath25-dimensional quotients of @xmath18 , then @xmath17 and @xmath864 are the pullbacks of the tautological quotient bundle and subbundle respectively , so @xmath865 is isomorphic to the pullback of the tangent bundle of @xmath863 .",

    "this leads to several problems .",
    "given vector bundles @xmath3 and @xmath249 , the classes of nontrivial extensions are parametrized by the projective space @xmath867 .",
    "the extensions with @xmath17 semistable form an open set @xmath868 of @xmath869 , whereas the extensions for which a given number of independent sections of @xmath249 are liftable to @xmath17 form a closed subset @xmath18 of @xmath869 .",
