    "with the installation of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , the efficiency of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ in performing wide - area and deep surveys has increased ten - fold .",
    "such data are required to study formation and evolution of galaxies and are essential in identifying high - redshift galaxies .",
    "significant progress has been made in recent years in performing multi - waveband deep surveys , greatly extending the range of accessible redshifts and enhancing our knowledge of properties of galaxies out to the re - ionization epoch ( beckwith et al .",

    "one of the general methods to select galaxies at high redshift is drop - out technique ( e.g. , steidel et al . 1996 ) , monitoring the lyman break ( 912  ) feature in galaxies as it moves with redshift to longer wavelengths and progressively out of the observed ( shorter ) passbands .",
    "such high - z galaxies have been found in large numbers in the great observatories origins deep survey fields ( goods ; giavalisco et al . 2004b ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ; stanway et al . 2004 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ) and are used to investigate the origin of cosmic re - ionization at @xmath8 ( e.g. , barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "another technique to identify high-@xmath9 objects is narrow - band search for strong lyman @xmath2 emitters ( laes ) ( e.g. , hu , cowie & mcmahon 1998 ; cowie & hu 1998 ; rhoads & malhotra 2001 ; hu et al . 2002 ; ajiki et al . 2003 ; kodaira et al . 2003 ,",

    ", we present results from a narrow - band survey in the goods fields , searching for laes at @xmath10 .",
    "the area coverage and depth of the goods , combined with its multi - wavelength imaging data , allows unbiased selection of a population of laes at high redshifts .",
    "furthermore , availability of deep spitzer and chandra data , high resolution acs images and ground - based optical - ir data in the goods fields allow a study of the nature of laes , their morphology and star formation rate at @xmath10 and provides an unbiased sample of laes to compare with homogeneously selected lbgs at a similar redshift .",

    "the _ nb816 _   survey covers a total of 160 arcmin@xmath5 area in each field , corresponding to the full goods - acs area ( a total of 320 arcmin@xmath5 area ) .",
    "the transverse co - moving area of the lae survey at @xmath10 is 1.8 @xmath25 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "combined with the fwhm of the filter , which has a gaussian - like shape , this corresponds to a co - moving depth of 45 mpc ( @xmath26 to @xmath27 ) and a combine volume of @xmath28 mpc@xmath29 .",

    "the first two criteria ensure that the objects at @xmath38 are undetected ( at 2 @xmath19 noise level ) in @xmath21 and @xmath22 while , the third condition allows selection of laes with a rest - frame lyman @xmath2 equivalent width @xmath39  .",

    "since none of our lae candidates have red @xmath46 colors , similar to what expected for stars , our lae survey is expected to be free from contamination by red stars .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the @xmath43- and @xmath44-band data here are deeper than those of hu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) by @xmath47 magnitude , we expect a contamination rate of @xmath4814% for our sample of laes here .",
    "using the estimated survey volume for each field , @xmath49 mpc@xmath29 , and the number of lae candidates found at @xmath32 , we estimate the lae space density of @xmath50lae@xmath51mpc@xmath52 and @xmath53mpc@xmath54 for goods - n and goods - s respectively .",

    "2003 ; hu et al .",
    "2004 ) ( lower panel in figure [ ll ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the number density of our sample of laes with lyman @xmath2 luminosities of @xmath62 ergs s@xmath14 , is higher ( by a factor of @xmath63 ) than those of the other surveys .",
    "this seems attributed to the relatively deeper completeness limit for our survey [ @xmath64(ly@xmath2)@xmath65 ergs s@xmath14 corresponding to @xmath66 compared to the previous studies , including ; rhoads & malhotra [ 2001 ; @xmath64(ly@xmath2)@xmath67 ergs s@xmath14 ] , ajiki et al . [ 2003 ; @xmath64(ly@xmath2)@xmath69 ergs s@xmath14 ] , and hu et al . [ 2004 ; @xmath64(ly@xmath2)@xmath70 ergs s@xmath14 ] .",
    "the extra depth enables our survey to include more laes with the lyman @xmath2 luminosities @xmath71 ergs s@xmath14 than the previous surveys .",
    "we also note that , for luminosity [ @xmath72(ly@xmath2)@xmath73 ergs s@xmath14 ] , the number density of our combined ( goods - n and -s ) sample is higher than that of rhoads & malhotra ( 2001 ) by a factor of @xmath74 while lower than those of ajiki et al.(2003 ) and hu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) by a similar factor .      using the lae luminosities",

    "the results are given in the third column of table [ tab : llae ] .",
    "we note that the sfr derived here can be underestimated due to the effect of absorption by h i gas both in the host galaxies and in the intergalactic space . the sfrs range from 4 to 11 @xmath81 yr@xmath14 with a median of 5.2 @xmath80 yr@xmath14 .",

    "2005 ) .",
    "it is instructive to examine whether the sfrs derived from lyman @xmath2 luminosities here are consistent with those derived from the uv continuum luminosity from the broad - band data in the goods .",
    "we convert the observed @xmath24 magnitudes to uv continuum luminosities at @xmath83  . using the relation ( kennicutt 1998 ;",

    "the estimated sfrs are summarized in table [ tab : llae ] .",
    "comparison between the sfrs for individual sources , estimated from @xmath86(ly@xmath2 ) and @xmath86(uv ) ( see figure [ sfr ] ) , shows that , on average , @xmath86(uv ) is relatively higher than @xmath86(ly@xmath2 ) for most of the lae candidates .",
    "we also measure the average sfr ratios , @xmath87(ly@xmath2 ) / @xmath87(uv)@xmath88 , where @xmath87(ly@xmath2 ) and @xmath87(uv ) are , respectively , the sum of @xmath86(ly@xmath2 ) and @xmath86(uv ) of all our lae candidates .",
    "this ratio is close to that obtained by ajiki et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for their sample of laes at @xmath32 .",
    "the lower value of @xmath86(ly@xmath2 ) can be attributed to the effect of the dust extinction and scattering by the intergalactic medium .",
    "however , some of our lae candidates have @xmath86(ly@xmath2 ) / @xmath86(uv ) @xmath89 .",
    "these are likely to be in a very early phase ( @xmath90 yr ) of star formation activity , in which , @xmath86(uv ) values are underestimated ( schaerer 2000 ; see also nagao et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) . as illustrated in the right panel of figure [ sfr ] ,",
    "objects with small @xmath86(uv ) have higher @xmath86(ly@xmath2 ) / @xmath86(uv ) ratios .",
    "this , in part , is explained by selection effects in the _",
    "nb816_-limited sample ( i.e. , our survey can not find objects below the dotted curve in the right panel of figure [ sfr ] )",
    ". however , all objects with @xmath86(ly@xmath2 ) / @xmath86(uv ) @xmath89 ( i.e. , the age of @xmath90 yr ) have @xmath86(uv ) @xmath91 .",
    "this implies that the uv continuum emission of very young star - forming galaxies are too faint to be found in typical lbg surveys .",
    "the narrow - band survey provides a very efficient method to investigate such very young star - forming galaxies .",
