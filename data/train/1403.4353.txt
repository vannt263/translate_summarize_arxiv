    "recently , we introduced a technique of synthetic tracking that enabled detection of small and fast moving near - earth asteroids ( neas ) using short exposure frames @xcite .",
    "detecting and characterizing of small asteroids is important for several reasons . while being the subject of an interesting and rapidly - evolving area of planetary science , asteroids present a threat to the infrastructure and life on our planet .",
    "for example , a 17  m asteroid that hit russia on feb . 15 , 2013 , caused a severe damage to buildings and inflicted injuries to hundreds of people @xcite .",
    "in addition , some neas may become targets for focussed space exploration efforts in the near future .",
    "in particular , characterizing small neas is needed to provide a potential target list for the upcoming nasa s asteroid redirection mission @xcite .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the synthetic tracking method processes the data from a number of short exposure frames by shifting each frame according to a tracking velocity vector so that the superposition of these shifted frames simulates a long - exposure integration with the telescope tracking at that velocity .",
    "this technique improves the detection s signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) by avoiding the trailing loss , which typically affects the detection of fast - moving neas at distances @xmath2 0.1 au from the earth .",
    "this advantage is especially valuable for detecting small neas because these objects are observable only at short distances .",
    "the improved snr from using the synthetic tracking technique yields a more precise astrometry of neas .",
    "in addition , synthetic tracking gains accruacy in astrometry from the reduction of the effects due to atmospheric disturbances and imprecise telescope pointing ( to be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : astrometry ] ) .",
    "synthetic tracking technique is made possible by the availability of new generation cameras that provide both fast frame rate and low read noise .",
    "for example , scientific cmos cameras can read at 100  hz frame rate and only introduce read noise at 1e@xmath3 level .",
    "see a description of technical capabilities of the andor s neo and zyla scmos cameras at : http://www.andor.com/pdfs/literature/andor_scmos_brochure.pdf ] our observation on palomar 200-inch used the andor s emccd@xmath4 operating at high em gain of 200 , making the read noise benign compared with the sky background noise even for the 16.7  hz frame rate .",
    "this enabled us to detect a faint object at the apparent magnitude of 23 using about 30 sec of data ( @xmath5 500 frames ) . without synthetic tracking , the detected asteroid with speed 5.97 degrees per day ( @xmath6 ) moves about 7 arcsecond ( @xmath7 ) in the field .",
    "the corresponding surface brightness of the asteroid yields approximately @xmath8 ( apparent magnitude 24.5 ) , below the detection threshold of @xmath9 , set as our data processing criterium .",
    "an additional benefit of synthetic tracking is that it allows one to estimate velocity using only 30 sec of data , making confirmation task much easier .",
    "a 12-hour blind search was conducted on september 11 and 12 , 2013 , with six hours per night .",
    "our survey continuously scanned over the sky at a rate of 5  @xmath10 , so that each star stays in the field for @xmath11  sec .",
    "it took about an hour to scan over each field of size 5.0@xmath00.043@xmath1 ( right ascention ( ra ) @xmath12 declination ( dec ) ) .",
    "we repeated the scan in the next hour to have two consecutive one - hour data covering the same field .",
    "thus , during each night we covered three different 5.0@xmath00.043@xmath1 fields with a total of six fields .",
    "the faint asteroid was detected in the second field on september 11 , 2013 , and confirmed by the repeated scan . because this asteroid was observed twice , both times with snr of @xmath515 , the false positive rate is practically zero .",
    "the asteroid moved 3770 pixels over 4626 seconds giving 5.97  @xmath6 for the plate scale of 0.305  @xmath13pixel . using estimation of the asteroid population distribution from @xcite",
    ", we expected to detect 12 asteroids of h magnitude in range 2831 per night .",
    "our detection of one asteroid in the two - night survey is consistent with this expectation .",
    "the main step in the data processing with synthetic tracking technique is to search for signals ( or bright spots ) in the synthetically integrated images for a grid of tracking velocities .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , this process is computationally intensive . to overcome this difficulty , we use graphics processing units ( gpus ) to perform synthetic tracking at different velocities in parallel , thus , enable nearly real - time data processing . to improve the snr",
    ", we adopt a matched filter scheme @xcite to low - pass filter the data using the point spread function ( psf ) as the impulse response . for convenience",
    ", we use a moffat s psf function template @xcite as our psf model to quantify the shape of psf and to reduce the computation in centroid fitting .",
    "we use a bright star in the field to determined psf model parameters . a co - moving psf fitting to the data frames",
    "is performed to generate precise astrometric solutions and velocities for both asteroids and the stellar objects present in a frame .",
    "the signal level resulting from the fitting is used to compute snr and a false positive probability .",
    "this approach yields the same snr as the matched filter scheme @xcite in the case of using a template filter velocity matching that of the asteroid .",
    "the new feature in our approach is that we search in the tracking velocity space for the faint object using parallel computing and then optimize the tracking veloicty using the co - moving psf fitting .",
    "in addition to the improvement of the detection snr , synthetic tracking also yeilds more accurate astrometry for fast moving asteroids than the traditional long exposure approach .",
    "we achieved milli - arcsecond ( mas ) level astrometry for two known bright asteroids , observed on april 3 , 2013 , relative to nearby stars , after integrating over a minute using synthetic tracking .",
    "however , if using long exposures , as simulated by co - adding the short exposure frames , the astrometric precision does not improve after integrating over 30 sec .",
    "this is because the effect due to atmosphere and imprecise telescope pointing is no longer common between the asteroids and the background stars .",
    "working on short exposure images , synthetic tracking technique makes the effect due to both the earth s atmosphere and telescope pointing errors common between the asteroids and the background stars and thus achieves the similar precision of the relative astrometry for the asteroids to that of the relative stellar astrometry@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the section  [ sec : syn_track ] , we present the details of the synthetic tracking technique . the relevant algorithms",
    "are described in section  [ sec : algorithm ] .",
    "we present the data processing approach in section  [ sec : data_processing ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we describe the results of the detection of the faint asteroid and also demonstrate precise astrometry results using data from observing two known asteroids . observation strategies using synthetic tracking for detecting small neas are discussed .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "as introduced by @xcite , synthetic tracking is a post - processing technique that integrates a set of short exposure frames to simulate the tracking of the telescope at a specific velocity , which we call the synthetic tracking velocity .",
    "figure [ fig_synframes ] shows the integration of the displaced frames according to the velocity that is needed to track a nea . as this procedure",
    "is done in software , one has the flexibility of choosing all feasible tracking velocities . for a nea detection , we search in the synthetic tracking velocity space for a signal of the asteroid without a trailing loss .",
    "this is possible because a synthetically tracked image is very close to the image obtained with a telescope that is actually tracking the asteroid . with synthetic tracking both the moving asteroid and",
    "the background stars can be in sharp focus .",
    "depending on the precision , at which the images are shifted , synthetic tracking may be performed in two different ways , which we call the integer - pixel - shift - add ( ipsa ) and the continuous - shift - add ( csa ) methods respectively .",
    "we address both of them below .",
    "the ipsa synthetic tracking integrates frame images by shifting them at an integer amount of pixels ( i.e. no shift of image is done at a fraction of a pixel ) according to the tracking velocity and then adding the signals collected on each of these frames .",
    "the quantity of interest here is the integrated intensity of the synthetically tracked image,@xmath14 , which is computed as , i_ipsa(x , y , v_x , v_y ) = _",
    "n=0 ^ 1 i_n ( x + round(n v_x ) , y + round(nv_y ) ) , where @xmath15 labels the frames and runs from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath18 represent the location of a particular pixel on a ccd in ( row , column ) order , with vector @xmath19 being the synthetic tracking velocity .",
    "@xmath20 is the intensity of the pixel at @xmath18 in the @xmath15-th frame .",
    "function @xmath21 rounds its argument to the nearest integer .",
    "because the frames have zero bias ( i.e. , the background has been subtracted ) , in the case , when the round values are out of the bound of the frame index , zeros are filled in . to properly estimate the noise level , it is necessary to record the actual number of frames that contribute to a signal when its location is near frame boundary .",
    "the frames that contribute  filled zeros \" to the signal should be excluded because the signal is outside of their appropriate boundaries .",
    "the advantage of the ipsa synthetic tracking is that it requires minimal number of arithmetic operations .",
    "it is suitable for an extensive search for neas where many such operations are performed .",
    "we implemented the ipsa synthetic tracking on gpus to search for nea signals over different tracking velocities in parallel .",
    "the csa synthetic tracking method integrates short exposure frames by shifting the frames according to the displacement determined by the velocity of tracking , but not limited to integer number of pixels .",
    "the images are displaced using the spectral interpolation or the fourier space interpolation method @xcite .",
    "the spectral interpolation method for shifting the images is based on the fact that the fourier transforms of the original and shifted images are related by a phase factor linear in spatial frequencies .",
    "mathematically , if we shift an image @xmath22 by @xmath23 along row and column , the displaced image is related to the original image via i^ft ( x + x , y + y ) = ft^-1 \\ { ft \\ { i(x , y ) } e^-2 i ( k_x x + k_y y ) } , [ spec_interp ] where @xmath24 represents the fourier transform \\{i(x , y ) } _ x , y i(x , y ) e^2i ( k_x x + k_y y ) , and @xmath25 is the inverse fourier transform . for a tracking velocity vector @xmath19 , the csa synthetic tracking image is then computed relying on the following expression ( x , y , v_x , v_y ) = _",

    "the short exposure frames were taken at a frame rate of 2  hz .",
    "figure [ fig_star_and_2009bl2 ] shows two synthetic tracking images for tracking the background stars ( left ) and the asteroid 2009bl@xmath26 ( right ) , respectively , while using csa synthetic tracking with total of 960 frames of data .",

    "the synthetic tracking psfs of the star and asteroid are very similar , with @xmath31 of the asteroid 2009bl@xmath26 only 4% larger than that of the star .",
    "we note that even though the ipsa synthetic tracking only has resolution of one pixel , the achieved synthetic tracking image is very close to using the csa synthetic tracking because the error due to neglecting sub - pixel ( pix ) displacement is much smaller than the size of the psf ( @xmath53  pix ) .",

    "csa is useful in post analysis for generating refined psfs of tracked objects .",
    "in this section we present the algorithm for estimating the background , that was used extensively in our data pre - processing , and the least - squares algorithm to perform fitting for astrometric parameters , that was used in the post - analysis .",
    "application of both of these algorithms will be described in sec .",
    "[ sec : data_processing ] .      to detect faint objects , we need to accurately estimate the background bias to avoid too many false positives ( under - estimated background ) or miss - detections ( over - estimated background ) . in the data frames , majority of the data points measure the sky background .",
    "only a small portion detects the light from the stars and asteroids .",
    "therefore , we can estimate the background by removing the signals , as outliers .",
    "this is done by starting with including all the data points in background data set and iteratively removing the signals that are above the average of background by a threshold , _ e.g. _  5@xmath34 ( @xmath34 is the standard deviation ) .",
    "the steps characterizing the background estimation procedure are given as follows :    1 .",

    "the larger @xmath42 is , the faster the convergence can be reached .",
    "however , a larger threshold means a higher chance of including weak signals into the background .",
    "we used @xmath43 at the beginning to estimate an overall pixel independent background using 50 frames of data and then used @xmath44 to estimate a pixel dependent background using about 2000 frames .",
    "co - moving psf fitting optimizes the astrometry and velocity of the detected object by a least - squares fitting of multiple short exposure data to a psf that moves at the velocity of the object .",
    "this assumes a _ priori _ knowledge of the psf function .",

    "the estimations of the location and velocity from synthetic velocity search are used as the initial condition for the optimization routines .",
    "the mathematical formulation of the fitting is based on explaining the observed multiple short exposure signals as a moving psf , which can be expressed as a minimization of the following least - squares cost function , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the psf function , @xmath47 is the location of the object at the mid epoch of all the frames , and @xmath19 is the velocity of the moving object ( i.e. , the telescope tracking velocity ) .",

    "we then estimate a pixel - dependent background intensity and an average background noise level using about 2000 frames of data . to do this , we first estimate a uniform background ( pixel independent ) and noise level by computing the sample mean and standard deviation of background data in a small number ( e.g. , 50 ) of frames .",
    "it is convenient to divide all the data points into two parts , background data and signals , assuming signals are above the background for a specified threshold .",

    "the detected objects are passed to post - analysis for further identification .",
    "for example , a very bright asteroid may be detected if its single frame signal is above the specified detection threshold .",
    "also , if an asteroid does not move much during the observation period , it may be detected as a static object .",
    "we remove the signals of the detected objects by setting the values at the relevant pixels to zero . before passing to the next step ,",
    "we apply the matched filter by convolving each data frame with the psf profile to lessen computational operations during the extensive synthetic tracking velocity search .",
    "synthetic tracking velocity search examines the data over a two dimensional tracking velocity grid .",
    "to avoid trailing loss , the grid spacing should be no more than the size of the psf divided by the integration time , i.e. the speed at which the motion is less than the size of psf over the integration time ( 30 sec in our case ) .",
    "an ipsa synthetic tracking is performed for each grid velocity .",
    "because the frames have zero background , we fill in zeros for the missing data at the boundaries of frames that are displaced .",
    "if the synthetic tracking image shows a signal above the noise level by the detection threshold of 7 , we report this signal level together with four numbers @xmath62 , where @xmath18 specifies the location of the detected signal and @xmath19 is the grid velocity at which the synthetic tracking yields the signal .",
    "the post - analysis uses these information to refine the detection snr and to compute astrometry using optimization schemes .",
    "because data processing for the synthetic tracking search is independent between different tracking velocities , it can be easily speeded up by implementing parallel computing .",

    "the star locations vary due to atmosphere effect and imprecise telescope pointing with an rms of 100 mas .",
    "we de - trended ( by removing an overall constant and a linear trend from the data ) both the star locations ( there is a small drift in the tracking ) and asteroid locations to see the common temporal variation of the locations .",

    "this shows the cancellation of of the common temporal variations shown in top and mid plots between asteroid and star .",
    "however , this does not happen if we co - add the images to synthesize a long exposure .",
    "figure [ fig_err_rms_vs_exp ] shows the astrometry error rms as function of the integration time .",
    "the three pairs of curves show the rmss of the astrometry errors for using synthetic tracking with short exposures ( dots ) and a single exposure with the duration being the integration time and processed using a conventional centroid fitting to a 2-d gaussian psf ( diamond ) or a gaussian trail function ( squares ) as described in @xcite .",
    "the solid and empty markers denote declination and right ascension respectively .",
    "we can see the performance difference between the synthetic tracking and the conventional long exposure results . comparing with the estimated photon noise limited error rmss ( dot dashed line ) using eq .",
    "( [ comoving_lsq ] ) , as the integration time increases , the synthetic tracking astrometry error is close to be photon noise limited and decreases as the inverse of the square root of the integration time .",
    "however , the traditional long exposure approach does not improve as the integration time goes beyond 30 sec because the image of the asteroid is streaked by more than 1@xmath7 and the error is not dominated by the photon noise , but by the effects from atmospheric and imprecise telescope pointing , which is no longer common between the streaked asteroid and the background star images .",
    "figure [ fig_rel_astr_res_cmp ] displays the residual of relative astrometry , after fitting to a linear motion , with 80 sec integration time , for the cases of using synthetic tracking ( circles ) , long exposure with a 2-d gaussian fitting ( diamonds ) , and long exposure with a gaussian trail fitting ( squares ) respectively .",
    "the synthetic tracking using short exposures enables to achieve mas - level astrometry precision , close to being photon and background noise limited as in relative stellar astrometry @xcite . using long exposure , on the other hand , the errors due to atmosphere and imprecise telescope pointing are non - common between the asteroid and stars and thus lead to tens of milliarcsecond errors in relative astrometry .",
    "these are results of using telescope of 5 m. the atmospheric effect for using 1-m class telescopes is expected to be even larger .",
    "we obtained similar results for the asteroid 2013fq@xmath84 , which we observed for 300  sec .",
    "figure  [ fig_2013fq10_rms ] , which is the same plot as fig .",
    "[ fig_err_rms_vs_exp ] for 2013fq@xmath84 , shows the improvement of astrometry as we integrate more 2 hz frames .",
    "the residual errors are mainly due to photon and background noise as estimated using the empirical formula eq .",
    "( [ cent_snr ] ) .",
    "the error becomes single digit of mas after integrating over 100  sec .",
    "again , if we would use long exposure ( _ i.e_. , 30 sec ) images , even with the state of art fitting of a gaussian trail ( square markers ) , the error would still be as large as tens of mas , growing with the integration time .",
    "synthetic tracking is especially valuable for detecting very small and fast moving asteroids .",
    "the vast majorities of these objects are so small and move so rapidly that follow - up observations have to be planned from the start . finding the object one hour later when it moved 1000@xmath7 is possible only because our single observation has a coarse velocity measurement . for really faint object with @xmath85 , the coarse velocity measurement with uncertainty @xmath5 0.3  @xmath6 , would not let another observatory find it one day later easily",
    "in the recent observing run , we scanned each part of the sky twice .",
    "however , a large portion of that time is wasted .",
    "ideally we would have the gpu software running to detect the neas in near real time so that the second confirming observation could be made within the time frame ( a few hours ) later before the uncertainty in the location of the asteroid becomes larger than the fov . once confirmed we should spend significantly more than 30 sec to get astrometry approaching 50  mas so that three observations spaced a few days apart would let us derive an orbit where the object could be observed again at the next apparition @xcite .",
    "objects with h@xmath52830 moving at 6  @xmath6 are detectable only on medium to large telescopes with synthetic tracking cameras , and even then , only for a week or so before they are too faint to be detected .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to have a strategy like discussed above to discover the object within its time window for observation .",
    "we have presented the detection of a faint object as an application of the synthetic tracking technique to observational data taken on the palomar 200-inch telescope including the data processing method and algorithms to demonstrate the efficacy . synthetic tracking significantly improved detection snr over traditional long exposure approach for fast moving neas , and thus enabled the detection of this faint object at apparent magnitude of 23 .",
    "it also yields more precise astrometry by improving snr and making the effects due to atmosphere and imprecise telescope pointing common between the asteroid and background stars , which cancels to the first order in relatively astrometry .",
    "using the observational data of two known asteroids , we demonstrated milli aresecond level precision in astrometry . from a 12-hour blind search we found only one asteroid , which is consistent with harris s population distribution of asteroids within the order of magnitude .",
    "observation strategy using synthetic tracking to detect and discover faint objects within the short observation time window in general requires a well scheduled observation including a close to real time detection using 30 sec of observation data , confirmation within a few hours , and orbit determination within a week before the object becomes too faint to observe .",
