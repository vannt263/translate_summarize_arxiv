    "it has become clear that the mid - infrared properties of galaxies are dependent on metallicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the infrared emission , particularly from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) grains ,",
    "is usually driven by the radiation from young stars ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the strength of pah emission is altered and may begin to break down for lower metallicity systems . in the most extreme cases of sbs 0335 - 052 and",
    "i zw 18 , two of the lowest metallicity galaxies known , there is no evidence for pah emission @xcite .",
    "however these two sources show dramatically different mid - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) that indicate the presence of a cold dust ( @xmath9",

    "while metallicity may influence the strength of the pah features , these galaxies indicate that it is not the key to understanding the mid - infrared slope in the lowest metallicity systems .",
    "the correlation between the pah emission from galaxies and metallicity has been attributed to the harder radiation field in lower metallicity systems causing the break - down of the pah molecules @xcite and to the delayed injection of pah molecules into the interstellar medium due to the youth of the stellar populations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the shape of the mid - infrared continuum in galaxies , which is usually attributed to the temperature of the dust and the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the galaxy , does not seem to be dependent on the metallicity of the system .    in this paper",
    "we continue the exploration of the relationship between the mid - infrared properties of galaxies and their metallicity , luminosity , and sfr .",
    "we build on the work presented by @xcite for 19 galaxies by discussing the mid - infrared properties of much larger samples of 86 galaxies presented in  3.1 .",
    "we examine the relationship between colors (  3.2 ) , metallicity (  3.3 ) , and sfr (  3.4 ) and the properties of galaxies . in  3.5 , we use this expanded sample to compute the 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity function for the star - forming dwarf galaxies and compare it with that for local galaxies as a whole @xcite .",
    "we also use the 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity density as a measure of the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) and compare it with the value derived from the h@xmath8 luminosity density .",
    "distances throughout this paper are based on @xmath11 = 70 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 .",
    "all magnitudes discussed in this paper are vega relative magnitudes .",
    "the galaxies in this sample are selected from the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss , @xcite ) , the first fully digital objective prism survey for extragalactic emission - line objects .",
    "the galaxies represent a star - forming dwarf ( @xmath13 ) galaxy sub - sample of the kiss galaxies selected by their hh@xmath8  emission lines .",
    "the sample consists of all 60 kiss - selected dwarf galaxies in the 1.3@xmath14 wide strip centered on @xmath15(b1950)=29@xmath1430@xmath16 @xcite with velocities less than 9000 kms@xmath12 .",
    "we combine these data with 26 star - forming dwarf galaxies within the botes field where no velocity limit has been imposed , 16 of which have velocities greater than 9000 kms@xmath12 .",
    "the botes field is a 8.5 deg@xmath17 region that has been observed both as a part of kiss survey and the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are 19 galaxies in this field that overlap with spitzer shallow survey area @xcite .",

    "the ellipse task was used to fit elliptical isophotes to the galaxy given a fixed center , ellipticity , and position angle .",
    "the background was defined as the average intensity in ellipses that are at least 5 pixels beyond the extent of the galaxy ( usually within an annulus at a radius of 3645 pixels except for the four largest systems for which larger annuli were used ) .",

    "introduced a background gradient across the image . for these sources , the imsurfit task within iraf was used to fit a second - order polynomial to the background in order to remove the gradient after the initial background subtraction . after the image was background subtracted , the galaxy flux was measured within the previously determined extent of the galaxy from a second run of the ellipse fitting routine .    the flux errors were assumed to be the combination of the poisson errors and a systematic error due to the uncertainty in the galaxy extent .",
    "the flux error due to the uncertainty in the galaxies extent was computed to be the change in the measured flux when the galaxy extent was increased or decreased by 1 pixel or by 10% , whichever was larger .",

    "the median 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity in the sample is 0.004@xmath59  while the median value at @xmath2-band and 3.6 @xmath0 m  is 0.06@xmath59 .",
    "this lower luminosity with respect to @xmath59  at 8.0 @xmath0 m  implies that there is a deficit of hot dust and pah emission in these galaxies with respect to the majority of galaxies . *",
    "as we found previously with the smaller sample , star - forming dwarf galaxies have much bluer than average optical colors and span a wide range of infrared colors . in [ 3.6 ] @xmath4 [ 8.0 ] , the galaxies range from very red objects to the colors of early type galaxies .",
    "the fraction of very red star - forming dwarf galaxies is almost 4 times higher than it is for sdwfs galaxies with similar optical colors . *",
    "the larger sample investigated in this paper indicates that the [ 3.6 ] @xmath4 [ 8.0 ] color is correlated with luminosity , metallicity , and to a much lesser extent sfr .",
    "these relationships were not evident with the smaller sample presented in paper i. * the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relationship for star - forming dwarf galaxies has a shallower slope than what is found for the full kiss sample , consistent with the low - luminosity slope of the sdss relationship .",
    "the change in the slope of this relation with luminosity may indicate either a floor in the metallicity of galaxies or differences in the astrophysical processes ( e.g. , outflows versus closed - box enrichment ) that govern this relationship . * the relationship between luminosity , particularly at 8.0 @xmath0 m , and sfr indicates that the 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity is another probe of the sfr in galaxies despite the fact that the [ 3.6 ] @xmath4 [ 8.0 ] color shows a much stronger correlation with metallicity than with sfr . while there is a small correlation between the [ 3.6 ] @xmath4 [ 8.0 ] color and the sfr",
    ", there is no apparent correlation when we consider the relationship between color and specific sfr . *",
    "the consistency between the 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity function and density derived indicates that below 10@xmath5 @xmath6_@xmath7 , nearly all the 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity density comes from dwarf galaxies that exhibit strong h@xmath8 emission ",
    "i.e. , 8.0 @xmath0 m  and hh@xmath8selection identify similar galaxy populations .",
    "these galaxies span a similar range of sfrs and have similar space densities . *",
    "the 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity is , on average , a good indicator of sfr in these dwarf systems as measured by the comparison of the sfrd computed from the 8.0 @xmath0 m  and h@xmath8 emission .",
    "this is despite the deficit of hot dust and pah emission in the star - forming dwarf galaxies ( see the first point ) , the poor correlation between the [ 3.6 ] @xmath4 [ 8.0 ] color and the sfr , and the large spread in the sfr versus 8.0 @xmath0 m  luminosity relationship .",
