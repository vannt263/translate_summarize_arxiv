    "we use an exact calculation of a two - site hubbard model to estimate the adiabaticity of the ramp .",
    "the unnormalized singlet ground state of this system is given by @xmath110 there is hence a significant contribution of double occupancy in the regime where @xmath111 , as applies for the most strongly dimerized lattices investigated in this paper , whilst the contribution vanishes for the deep simple cubic lattice used for detection where @xmath112 . for the given ramp - times and including site - offsets due to the harmonic trapping potential ,",
    "the probability of populating excited states on a dimer during such a ramp remains below @xmath113 for all values of @xmath20 and @xmath114 explored in the dimerized systems .    in the anisotropic lattice , we directly ramp to @xmath115\\,e_{\\mathrm{r}}$ ] in @xmath105 ( @xmath116 throughout ) .",
    "in contrast to the dimer lattice ramp , this process can be considered sudden for all links , as the duration of the ramp is always well below the tunneling time in the initial lattice .",

    "<S> the system then behaves as an array of one - dimensional spin - ordered chains without correlations between them @xcite , where the majority of the entropy is stored in configurations involving the weak links . </S>",
    "<S> low - dimensional systems have been predicted to show enhanced nearest - neighbour correlations @xcite .    for temperatures much larger than the strong exchange energy the magnetic correlations should disappear . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b we study the dependence on the initial entropy @xmath42 and find the correlations to vanish above @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is expected .    owing to the presence of the harmonic trap , </S>",
    "<S> most spin correlated atoms are located in the center , where the filling is close to one particle per site . </S>",
    "<S> the density - normalized fraction of antiferromagnetic ordering is obtained when dividing by the fraction of atoms with two particles of arbitrary spin on adjacent sites . under the assumption that all spin correlators @xmath74 are equal  which applies if all symmetry breaking fields are much smaller than all other energy scales  </S>",
    "<S> the normalized spin correlator @xmath75 can be directly obtained from the measurement of singlets and triplets ( here @xmath76 is one for a single particle of any spin on site @xmath68 and zero otherwise ) @xmath77 the normalized antiferromagnetic correlations along the strong tunneling direction reach @xmath78 , see inset fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to approximately @xmath79 ordered atoms .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the observation of short - range quantum magnetism of repulsively interacting ultracold fermions in cubic lattices and investigated the dependence on temperature , lattice dimerization and anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on a local entropy redistribution scheme within the lattice structure and can be generalized to access the low temperature regime in different geometries , for example two - dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> the tunable geometry optical lattice allows the extension of our studies to spin - ladder systems , dimerized one - dimensional chains and zig - zag chains , where the interplay between quantum fluctuations and magnetic ordering plays a particularly important role @xcite . at even lower temperatures , the existence of spin - liquids in honeycomb or triangular lattices </S>",
