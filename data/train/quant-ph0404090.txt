    "with the advent of squeezed states of light  @xcite , a full quantum description of optical homodyne detection  @xcite assumed importance as homodyne detection ( hd ) yields phase  dependent measurements of the light field . whereas photodetectors acquire phase  insensitive information about photon statistics  @xcite , homodyne detection mixes the signal field with a coherent local oscillator ( lo ) to yield photon statistics on the output fields that depend on the phase  @xmath0 of the lo . by varying this phase  @xmath0 , phase  dependent properties of the signal state  @xmath1",

    "this technique , known as optical homodyne tomography  @xcite , illustrates another important application of homodyne detection .",
    "homodyne detection has evolved into a key tool of quantum optics with applications including squeezed light detection , optical homodyne tomography and continuous variable quantum teleportation @xcite .    the homodyne detection scheme discussed above involves mixing the signal field with a lo field at a beamsplitter ( bs ) , and the two output fields",
    "are subjected to photodetection , as shown in fig .",
    "the measured photodetection statistics are analyzed to infer the quadrature  phase statistics . only in the limit of infinite lo field strengths",
    "can the measurement be said to correspond to quadrature  phase measurements , and , of course , this limit is in principle unattainable .",
    "however , a good approximation to quadrature  phase measurements is attained . in the most useful variant ,",
    "a 50/50 bs is used , and the difference between the photocounts at the two output ports is used to infer the quadrature  phase statistics .",
    "this is known as balanced homodyne detection ( bhd ) and has the advantage of automatically canceling the photon number sum at the two input ports from the detected output fields .",
    "the description of homodyne detection begins with photodetection of the output fields and then , to validate the approximations normally applied in homodyne detection of quadrature  phase povm , must show that the resultant two ",
    "mode photon statistic reduces in some way to the quadrature  phase distribution , for the signal field  @xmath1 .",
    "this connection between photon statistics to quadrature  phase , or joint quadrature  phase , measurements has been established via calculations involving quasi - probability distributions or characteristic functions ( moment - generating functions ) for the electromagnetic field and allowing the local oscillator strength to become infinitely large .",
    "yuen and shapiro introduced the characteristic function approach in their seminal quantum theory of hd  @xcite , and walker employs wigner functions in his analysis of hd  @xcite .",
    "braunstein  @xcite uses the positive @xmath5-representation in the description of the photon counting statistics , and he emphasizes the quantum nature of the lo as he investigates `` the effects of a finite  amplitude fully - quantum - mechanical local oscillator '' .",

    "however , modern applications of homodyne detection , for example to quantum information applications such as continuous  variable quantum teleportation , requires an operational quantum theoretic approach  @xcite ; banaszek and wdkiewicz advocate the operational approach , but here we avoid the mean field approximation and thereby include correction terms for the povm corresponding to hd .",
    "the operational approach is important in the context that a measurement may be applied for some purpose other than characterizing the state  @xmath1 ; paradoxically , in continuous ",

    "is necessary .",
    "here we establish this connection between actual and convenient povms by directly calculating the photon counting probabilities using two different approaches : ( i ) working in the fock basis for the hilbert space of the signal and lo modes , we employ asymptotic expressions for su(2 ) wigner functions that are the bs matrix elements in the fock basis ; ( ii ) working in the over - complete basis of coherent states and taking advantage of the simple transformation of coherent states at the bs , we employ the glauber - sudarshan @xmath5-function .",
    "a balanced homodyne detection scheme is depicted in fig .  [ 4phd](a ) .",
    "the ( generally mixed ) signal state @xmath1 to be measured is coherently mixed at the bs with a lo assumed to be in a coherent state ( in the optical domain a coherent state with an absolute adjustable phase has not been achieved , but the coherent state approach leads to correct measured results provided that the signal field and lo field are derived from the same source  @xcite ) . the photon number difference from the two bs output ports",

    "( [ finalint ] ) that in the series in eq .",

    "the fact that the series converges for truncated states is very useful as it can be employed for states for which the series does not converge .",

    "another question concerns the practical usefulness of this truncation procedure . to see an example when it is not useful , consider the signal state as a coherent state with an amplitude @xmath168 , and its truncation for a very large @xmath157 ( say @xmath169 ) .",
    "in this situation , the series ( [ truncatedint ] ) diverges while after the truncation it becomes finite and so it converges . a closer inspection of eq .",
    "( [ truncatedint ] ) also shows that the initial subsequent terms grow very quickly for both the original and truncated states .",
    "therefore we would need very many of them to calculate the probabilities @xmath42 using the truncation procedure and eq .",
    "( [ truncatedint ] ) , which would not be very practical and it would be much simpler to calculate @xmath158 directly .",
    "this can be expected as the signal field is not weaker than the lo field .    on the other hand , in many situations",
    "our result is very useful .",
    "our calculations were motivated by trying to show that homodyne detection measures the field quadrature , and to find correction terms .",
    "this happens for large amplitudes of lo when the term @xmath170 in the photon counting probability @xmath158 is the largest and dominant one . in such situations",
    "the truncation works very well and the series ( [ truncatedint ] ) gives good correction terms for balanced homodyne detection as can be seen in the following section .",
    "we should also note that the convergence of the series ( [ truncatedint ] ) is not directly related to the behavior of the initial terms .",
    "it can happen ( e.g. for a weak thermal state or a weakly squeezed vacuum state ) that the initial subsequent terms decrease quickly but after some time , they start to grow and the series diverges . at the same time , for weak signal states ( compared to the lo ) these first terms provide an increasingly good approximation to the photon counting probability @xmath158 as can be seen in the next section with numerical simulations .",
    "the situation is thus similar to the one in perturbation theory : even though a perturbation series diverges , its several ( or many ) initial terms may give a good approximation .",
    "we would like to address the question now of when the lo is strong enough so that bhd really performs the projective measurement of the quadrature phase of the signal field .",
    "it can be roughly said that it is in situations for which the first term @xmath170 in the brackets in eq .",

    "let us focus at the second and third terms , @xmath171 , \\label{second_term}\\ ] ] and try to estimate their magnitude compared to @xmath172 .",
    "first , the distribution of the lo photon number is poissonian with both mean and variance equal to @xmath61 .",

    ", @xmath47 can be an arbitrary integer , but if it is not close enough to @xmath61 , the probability @xmath42 becomes negligible . in this sense",
    "we mean that @xmath147 is of order of @xmath173 .    to estimate @xmath174 ,",
    "we will consider two different types of signal states  a coherent state and a number state .",
    "the discussion for a general state would be very difficult , and we think that coherent and number states are good representatives that can help us understand the general behavior of the series in eq .",

    "for which @xmath176 , @xmath177 this means that the term  ( [ second_term ] ) in the series  ( [ truncatedint ] ) is of order of @xmath178 compared to the first term @xmath172 .",
    "we see that if the mean photon number in the signal state is much less than the magnitude of the lo amplitude , the leading term is dominant .",
    "for the signal field in a number state @xmath73 we have @xmath179 the magnitude of the inner product @xmath180 can be considered roughly the same as that of @xmath181 for our purpose . as @xmath182 is close to @xmath63 for @xmath183",

    "the result is that if @xmath184 , where @xmath185 means the average photon number in the signal state , the subsequent terms decrease quickly and homodyne detection indeed measures the field quadrature phase . it should be noted that it is not enough if the mean number of photons @xmath186 in the signal state is much less than the number of photons in the lo ; in fact , the correct condition is that the _ square _ of @xmath185 must be much smaller than the number of photons in the lo .",
    "this condition has a clear physical interpretation . as the photon number in the coherent state @xmath187 has a poissonian distribution of width @xmath51 , the condition of a strong lo",
    "can be formulated such that the mean photon number in the signal must be much less than the _ fluctuation _ of the photon number in lo .",
    "now suppose for a moment that the opposite would hold . then from the knowledge of the total photon number @xmath47 we could access some information about the photon number in the signal state .",
    "however , the photon number operator does not commute with the quadrature @xmath188 , so this would necessarily disturb the measurement of @xmath188 . on the other hand , if the strong lo condition is satisfied , then we do not know how many of the @xmath47 photons come from the signal and how many come from the lo ; thus , the different possibilities can interfere and the distribution of @xmath188 is not affected .      in this section",
    "we show some numerical simulations of our results . for a given pure signal state @xmath78 and a given photon number sum @xmath47",
    "we compare the exact photon counting probability @xmath42 calculated with the help of eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) with the series  ( [ truncatedint ] ) truncated at different points .",
    "the purpose of such a simulation is to show that taking increasing number of terms in the series  ( [ truncatedint ] ) gives an increasingly better approximation to the exact probability @xmath189 .",
    "the lo amplitude was chosen to be @xmath190 which means that the mean photon number of the lo field is 400 .",
    "the value of @xmath19 in the individual plots was chosen randomly from the poissonian distribution of lo photon number .",
    "it has turned out during the simulations that changing @xmath19 inside the interval for which the probability @xmath42 is non - negligible does not affect the behavior of the series significantly . as the signal states we have chosen a coherent state with amplitude @xmath191 , a squeezed vacuum state  @xcite @xmath192\\,|0\\rangle$ ] with @xmath193 and a number state @xmath194 .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ simul ] .",

    "the simulations show that with increasing number of terms in the series  ( [ truncatedint ] ) , a better approximation to the exact photon counting probability is achieved .",
    "we have analyzed balanced homodyne detection in terms of the povm for photon counting by directly calculating the photon counting probability .",
    "we employed two different approaches .",
    "first , using asymptotic expressions for su(2 ) wigner functions allowed us to establish the non - trivial connection between the discrete variables @xmath167 corresponding to photon numbers being detected and the continuous quadrature phase variable @xmath198 . in the strong lo limit , we have shown that homodyne detection indeed performs the projective measurements corresponding to povm @xmath137 , where @xmath54 is the eigenstate of quadrature phase operator .",
    "second , employing the glauber - sudarshan @xmath5-function , we extended the result obtained by the first approach . for a very large amplitude of the lo ,",
    "the result was the same , and for finite amplitudes we obtained additional correction terms .",
    "even though the series we got does not converge in general , it can be used for determining the correction terms via truncation of the signal state in the fock basis .",
    "we have determined the strong lo condition for coherent and number signal states ",
    "the square of the mean photon number in the signal state must be much smaller than the mean photon number in the lo .",
    "we have also performed numerical simulations that confirm the validity of the quadrature - phase povm and the correction terms for a lo that is not strong for typical signal states .",
    "therefore , in addition to obtaining the quadrature - phase povm rigorously from the photon counting povm , we have an expansion that yields correction terms for the povm that works well for typical signal states in quantum optics .    in this paper",
    "we have considered a perfect hd scheme with ideal detectors , lo and bs and 100% mode - matching . in practice , all these elements are subject to imperfections , which disturbs the measurement . for example , the lo from a realistic laser has an amplitude distribution @xmath199 broader than the delta - function .",
    "this would convolute the probability @xmath200 , where we now write the dependence on @xmath36 explicitly , with @xmath199 . if this distribution is gaussian , then the strong lo measurement would correspond to a gaussian spread of the quadrature measurement with the imprecision corresponding to the degree of lo amplitude fluctuation .",
    "lossy beamsplitters and inefficient photodetectors would add vacuum noise that would result in gaussian spread of quadrature measurement , similar to the effect discussed above for the lo amplitude spread .",
    "finally , for a multi - mode field with the lo mode - matching condition satisfied , the detection efficiency can incorporate the mismatch between the beam and detector modes . if , on the other hand , the signal and lo modes are mismatched , hd efficiency declines , and beats between different frequency modes arise .",
    "our operational approach to hd ignores the realistic effects described above , but the theory is readily generalized to accommodate these effects by including inefficiencies and multimode description .",
    "moreover , if multimode fields and beats are desirable , heterodyne detection replaces homodyne detection ( for which signal and lo are frequency matched ) ; an operational formulation of heterodyne detection without mean field approximation is a topic of further research .",
