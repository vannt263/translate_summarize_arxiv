    "ngc1068 ( messier 77 ) is a nearby ( @xmath17 = 1137 km s@xmath11 ) and bright ( l@xmath18=l@xmath19 @xmath92 @xmath20 10@xmath21 l@xmath22 , @xcite ) seyfert galaxy , often considered as the prototypical seyfert type 2 galaxy .",
    "however , since the discovery of the broad permitted lines in the polarized optical spectrum of ngc1068 @xcite , it has become clear that this galaxy was in reality a _ hidden broad line region _ galaxy .",
    "the general distinction between the two types of seyfert galaxies might be due only to orientation effects , according to the so called unification model @xcite .",
    "being the strongest nearby seyfert 2 galaxy , it has been observed extensively over the whole electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "molecular ( co and hcn ) observations have shown a prominent starburst ring ( hereafter sf - ring ) at a radius of 1.0 - 1.5 kpc and a central circum - nuclear disk ( hereafter cnd ) with a diameter of @xmath23 @xmath9 300 pc @xcite .",
    "near - ir observations @xcite have clearly revealed a 2.3 kpc stellar bar .",
    "the compact ( @xmath91 pc ) hot dust source in the nucleus of ngc1068 , measured using near - infrared speckle imaging and integral field spectroscopy @xcite , is probably heated by the agn s strong radiation field and possibly associated with the postulated dense circum - nuclear torus . a jet was observed from centimeter to millimeter wavelengths extending out to several kiloparsecs from the center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "mid - ir observations revealed hot and ionized gas biconically following the path of the radio jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and indicating the existence of a parsec - scale warm dust torus @xcite .",
    "recent interferometric observations of co ( 3 - 2 ) and co ( 1 - 0 ) show that the co ( 3 - 2 ) emission peaks in the central region within @xmath9 5 @xmath24 from the nucleus , while the co(1 - 0 ) emission is mainly located along the spiral arms @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic coverage of ngc1068 has been extensive . in the mid - ir to far - ir wavelength range , spectra",
    "have been measured by the iso @xcite sws @xcite and lws @xcite spectrometers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) , covering the 2.4 - 45  @xmath0 m and 43 - 197  @xmath0 m spectral ranges . at millimeter wavelengths",
    "it was recently observed from the ground in the 190 - 307 ghz ( 976 - 1578  @xmath0 m ) range @xcite .",
    "the submillimeter waveband is one of the few spectral regions that have not been so far explored ; the new observations made by the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ) @xcite fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) @xcite , onboard the _ herschel _  space observatory @xcite , covering the spectral range from 190  @xmath0 m to 670  @xmath0 m , fill most of this gap with the first complete submillimeter spectrum of ngc1068 .",
    "submillimeter spectral measurements are of particular interest as ngc1068 is a prime candidate to study the effects of the agn onto the circum - nuclear material and the surrounding disk . in particular , the study of the excitation conditions and chemistry of the cnd appear already from the existing ground - based molecular line observations to be very different from the starburst galaxies environments . the peculiar line ratios of different molecular transitions , mostly hcn , hco@xmath16 , and @xmath25co , led to the suggestion that the cnd of ngc1068 harbors a giant x - ray - dominated region ( xdr , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hcn and hco@xmath16 molecular line studies of @xcite confirm an increased abundance of hcn and/or increased kinetic temperatures .",
    "co lines can also discriminate between `` classical '' photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) and x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using the intermediate j rotational lines from the co molecule , from j@xmath1=4 to j@xmath1=13 , which can be observed with the spire fts , we want to test if indeed in ngc1068 an xdr is needed to explain the spectral line energy distribution originating from the cnd",
    "the case of the ultraluminous ir galaxy mrk231 already demonstrated that the _ herschel_-spire data are indeed able to discriminate between the two emission mechanisms and therefore detect the effects of the agn @xcite . _ herschel_-pacs observations of the high - j co lines ( j@xmath26 ) detected in ngc1068 have been recently presented by @xcite .",
    "the two components , at high and medium excitation , needed to explain the observed co lines arising from the central 10@xmath24 region from j@xmath1= 14 to j@xmath1= 24 can be excited by x - ray or shock heating , while far - uv heating is unlikely .",
    "herschel_-spire spectroscopic observations of ngc1068 presented here have been collected under the guaranteed time key project `` physical processes in the interstellar medium of very nearby galaxies '' ( pi : christine wilson ) . within the same observational program , spire and photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs )",

    "error bars ) as a function of frequency ( colored points ) compared with the spire - fts beam ( broken lines ) .",
    "all source sizes in the ssw , except for [ nii]205  @xmath0 m , are consistent with the beam width at that frequency . in contrast , the source sizes in the slw are more extended than the beam . ]",
    "ngc1068 was observed with the spire - fts @xcite onboard the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite both in the single pointing mode with sparse image sampling and in the mapping mode with full image sampling .",
    "the fts has two detectors arrays called the spectrometer long wave ( slw , in the range of 303 - 671  @xmath0 m ) and the spectrometer short wave ( ssw , in the range 194 - 313  @xmath0 m ) , with a small ( 10 @xmath0 m ) overlap in wavelength .",
    "the spectral resolution of the fts ranges from about 280 km s@xmath11 to 950 km s@xmath11 in the high resolution mode , moving in wavelength from 194 @xmath0 m to 671 @xmath0 m .",
    "the two spire fts observations of ngc1068 were collected on operational day 626 ( 29 january 2011 ) ; the fully sampled map has observation i d 1342213444 and the single pointing `` deep '' spectrum has observation i d 1342213445 .",
    "the pointed observations were carried out both at low and high spectral resolutions ( fwhm @xmath9 30 ghz and 1.44 ghz ) , covered with 32 repetitions each , for a total on - source integration time of 410 seconds and 4,262 seconds respectively .",
    "the shallower mapping observations at high resolution had 8 repetitions and covered an area with a diameter of approximately 2@xmath27 .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 17,050 seconds .",
    "the fts beam size and shape vary as a function of frequency and can not be characterized by a simple gaussian response .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ lines_fwhm ] , where the observed source sizes of the brightest lines detected by the mapping observations of the spire fts are plotted as a function of frequency ( see the method described in section  [ sec : sizes ] ) , the fts beam widths ( fwhm ) range from 17  to 42 , probing a wider area in the sky with increasing wavelength , and show a strong discontinuity between the slw and ssw bands , due to the multi - moded feed - horns used for the spectrometer arrays ( see section 4.2.3 and figure 5.13 in the spire observers manual ) .    the combination of the complex morphology of the inner region of ngc1068 with the spire - fts beam properties yield a particular coupling effect between the two .",
    "figure  [ co_maps ] shows the co(3 - 2 ) and co(1 - 0 ) interferometric maps from @xcite of the central region of ngc1068 .",
    "as can be seen from these maps , the morphology of ngc1068 is dominated by two main components ( see also , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) : the compact ( of the order of 4  in diameter ) cnd at the center of the galaxy , possibly associated with the active nucleus , and a relatively extended ring , with a radius of the order of 10 - 20 , whose emission is dominated by star formation ( sf ) activity .",
    "the relative contribution from these two spatial components to the various rotational transitions of the @xmath25co molecule strongly varies with the transition from the low - j ( j@xmath28 ) to the high - j ( j@xmath29 ) lines . in this range the dominant source of co excitation changes from the extended sf - ring to the compact cnd .",
    "there is also a variation of the angular scale probed by the fts beam , from extended ( beam fwhm @xmath9 42 ) to compact ( 17 ) , as shown by the two concentric circles in the maps of figure  [ co_maps ] .",
    "we first describe the reduction procedure that was used for source size measurements , while in sections [ sec : maps ] and [ sec : point ] we describe the reduction procedure for spectral line measurements .",
    "we employ two reductions as the two measurements have different requirements .",
    "the mapping observations of ngc1068 have been reduced with the standard reprocessing pipeline in hipe v.7 and converted into spectral cubes using the naiveprojection task with custom pixel sizes of 11   and 13.8   for the ssw and slw bands , respectively .",
    "these sizes were chosen empirically starting from a large size and reducing it until holes ( pixel with zero coverage ) appeared in the maps .",
    "the final cube for each of the two fts bands has a variable on - source integration time in the map , between 16 and 32 fts scans . from these two cubes a number of sub - cubes",
    "have been obtained by extracting a 60 ghz wide window ( corresponding to @xmath30 bins in high spectral resolution ) around each line detected in the spectrum of the brightest spaxel , where a spaxel is defined as each one of the 5x5 spatial pixels which fill the spectrometer field of view , and modeling and subtracting the continuum emission with a 1@xmath31 order polynomial using hipe s task lineintensitymap .",
    "the fts data from a pointed observation have two available calibrations which provide the target s correct flux for the two extreme cases of an unresolved source and of an extended source that completely and uniformly fills the instrument beam . to determine which calibration to use , we measured the emitting region size for several lines from the analysis of the spectra cubes ( see figure  [ lines_fwhm ] ) .",
    "the source sizes of all the transitions present in the ssw band , with the exception of the [ nii]205  @xmath0 m line , are consistent with originating from an unresolved source and they are therefore well calibrated in the pointed spectrum using the unresolved source solution .",
    "for this reason , we used the line fluxes measured from the pointed spectrum for all the transitions in the ssw band except for the [ nii]205  @xmath0 m line , for which we have used the mapping observations .",
    "( [ nii ] emission arises from ionized gas and so we may expect some contribution from the sf - ring . ) for all the transitions in the slw band , we measured the source sizes from the mapping observations .",
    "we have obtained line integrated maps with the task integratemapfromcube from the spectral sub - cubes .",
    "the integration over the lines has made no use of the fitting functionality inside the task , because of the possible spurious detections observed for spectral features with low signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "these line maps have been used to measure the angular extent of the region emitting every detected line using a 2d gaussian fit . while the instrument psf is not strictly gaussian , because a large fraction of its light is in wider secondary lobes , this approach is robust enough to quantify the scale size of the emitting region through the fit of the psf core .    in conclusion ,",
    "the deep pointed spectrum in the ssw band samples primarily , not exclusively , the lines emitted by the compact source , while the slw band measures lines emitted by both the compact and the extended structures .",
    "this coupling effect between the beam and the target morphology makes it difficult to reconstruct the correct spectral line energy distribution ( sled ) for the @xmath25co molecular lines for the cnd alone . to overcome these problems ,",
    "we have combined the information extracted from the pointed spectrum with those derived from the mapping observations .",
    "the mapping observations of ngc1068 were again reduced using a modified version of the standard spectrometer map pipeline script in the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe ) v.9 , developers build 588 and version 8.1 of the spire calibration context .",
    "the standard reduction assumes that the source is extended and uniformly fills the beam . since our source",
    "does not fill the beam , the unique point source flux conversion measured for each bolometers was applied to each of the bolometers in our two arrays .",
    "after the point source correction , spectral cubes for the ssw and slw were created using the _ spireprojection _ task with _ projectiontype=``naive '' _ with a custom pixel size of @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively as before .",
    "this cube was used for all slw and the [ nii]@xmath34 m line intensity measurements .",
    "the single pointing / sparse observations of ngc1068 have been reduced using the spectrometer single pointing user pipeline in the _ herschel _ interactive processing environment ( hipe ) v.9 , developers build 588 and version 8.1 of the spire calibration context . an older version of this pipeline is described in @xcite .",
    "the observed submillimeter spectrum of ngc1068 , as measured from the spire - fts pointed observations , is shown in figure  [ fig : n1068_cont ] , where the large offset at @xmath35 is due to the large difference in the beam of the ssw and the slw spectrometers .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the transitions measured in the ssw band , except for the [ nii]205  @xmath0 m line , have been considered spatially unresolved and therefore measured from the pointed / deep spectrum , while , on the contrary , the other partially extended lines have been measured from the mapping observations .",
    "in order to measure the line fluxes of the extended component , the line maps have been convolved with 2d kernels @xcite to reach the same beam size at every frequency .",
    "the final psf corresponds to the coarsest angular resolution ( fwhm = 42 ) reached by the fts for a @xmath25co line ( i.e. the co ( 4 - 3 ) at 461.04 ghz ) .",
    "the kernels were built using the spire - fts psf measurements , dividing the psf image of the co ( 4 - 3 ) line by that of each detected line in the fourier space .",
    "the baseline was removed by first masking all of the spectral lines before fitting a high order polynomial to the remaining continuum .",
    "the intensities of the detected lines have been computed with a levenberg marquardt fitting procedure using the _ sinc function _ model .",
    "table  [ tab : lines ] presents , for each detected transition , the rest frequency , the energy of the upper level ( in k ) , the beam fwhm ( in arcsec.)(see the spire observers manual , the intensity value with both the 1@xmath36 statistical uncertainty and total uncertainty , which include the calibration uncertainty added in quadrature . for the mapping observations , we have adopted a fixed fwhm of 43.4   for all detected lines . for the pointed observations of the compact source , we have adopted a calibration uncertainty of 10% , while for the mapping observations of the extended source , in addition to the calibration uncertainty , we have also added in quadrature a flat - fielding uncertainty of 7%(see the spire observers manual ) .",
    "the lines detected with the fts are not spectrally resolved .",
    "figure [ fig : n1068_full ] presents the observed spectrum of ngc1068 with the identifications of all lines detected at s / n@xmath373 .",
    "a total of 24 emission emission lines have been detected with the _ herschel_-spire fts : ten lines from co ( from j@xmath38=4 to j@xmath38=13 ) , six lines from h@xmath2o , two from h@xmath2o@xmath16 , one from oh@xmath16 , hf and ch@xmath16 each , in addition to the three atomic lines ( from [ nii ] and [ ci ] ) .",
    "the apparent ringing in the spectrum is due to the _ sinc _ response of the fts to each line .    in table",
    "[ tab : lines ] we also included literature measurements , relative to both the compact source and the extended source .",
    "in particular , we considered in our analysis the interferometric observations of co ( 1 - 0 ) , ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) from @xcite , and the water lines from the _ herschel_-pacs observations ( s. hailey - dunsheath 2012 , private communication ) for the compact component , and , for the extended component , co ( 2 - 1 ) z - spec spectrometer observations at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) @xcite and james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) co ( 3 - 2 ) observations convolved to the 43.4beam ( c. wilson 2012 , private comm . ) .",
    "to obtain a general solution for the co physical conditions , we have first used the radiative transfer code radex @xcite .",
    "then , considering the best possible ranges of the parameters as derived from radex , we have also used the pdr and xdr models from @xcite and @xcite and @xcite , respectively , to provide constraints on the origin of the excitation of the measured lines , and in particular to determine whether there is an influence of the agn , through its x - ray emission , on the molecular gas in the cnd and sf - ring associated with ngc1068 .",
    "radex is a non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) code available from the leiden atomic and molecular database ( lamda , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the assumption of a uniform medium , using an escape probability formalism that models the entire emitting region as a single zone",
    ", radex performs statistical equilibrium calculations involving collisional and radiative processes .",
    "we used the collisional rate coefficients with h@xmath2 of @xcite . considering the radiation field from background sources given as input",
    ", it computes the molecular level populations in the optically thin limit in the first iteration and the optical depths and the escape probabilities for each line .",
    "the interdependence of the molecular level populations and the local radiation field requires that the solution is reached through an iterative method . at each iteration",
    ", the code computes new level populations using new optical depth values , until the two converge on a consistent solution .",
    "then the resulting line intensities are given as output .",
    "the input parameters required for radex are the background radiation field , the kinetic temperature t@xmath39 , the molecular hydrogen number density n(h@xmath2 ) ( assumed to be the only collision partner ) , and the ratio between the column density of the molecule and the width of the lines , which is the physically relevant quantity that determines the optical depth .",
    "we used radex to create a grid of solutions for the co transitions spanning wide ranges in t@xmath39 , n(h@xmath2 ) , and n@xmath40 ( see table [ table : radex ] ) . to compare this grid of models with our co measurements we used the bayesian likelihood analysis code @xcite , developed by the z - spec team @xcite .    ) .",

    "the thin solid line is the best model for the cnd component .",
    "the sum of all models is shown as a thick solid line . ]    computing the radex models , we have considered both models with and without the inclusion of the local background radiation to be added to the cosmological component of the cmb at 2.73k . to estimate the local background in the far - ir ,",
    "we have fitted the aperture photometry of the _ herschel_-pacs and spire maps at 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath0 m , respectively , that will be presented and discussed in a forthcoming paper ( spinoglio et al .",

    "we have used a circular aperture with a diameter of 33@xmath24   and a dust emissivity law with @xmath41=2 and we have derived a gray - body temperature of 35 k. in agreement with the higher j - co line fitting results of @xcite , we have found that the inclusion of this local background does not change significantly the results of the co fits that only include the cmb .",
    "therefore we have adopted only the cmb black - body radiation at 2.73 k as background radiation , for both the extended and compact sources .",
    "the presence of several spatial and spectral components in the co sled has required a multi - step approach , looking for the best solution of one component at a time and subtracting it from the others .",
    "we started by considering the co sled of the compact source , composed of the fts - ssw measurements in combination with the compact interferometric observations .",
    "for the high - j ( j@xmath42 ) pacs data , we used the medium excitation ( me ) component lvg model presented by @xcite , characterized by a density of @xmath43 and a kinetic temperature @xmath44  k. the me model for the j@xmath38 @xmath37 13 co lines was subtracted from the observed cnd spectrum before attempting to fit the sled .    in table",

    "the compact source is unresolved with all the considered instruments and identified with the cnd , while the extended source data probe the emission arising from a region of 43.4   in diameter , compatible with the sf - ring structure .",
    "we have obtained the best fit to the cnd with radex , as can be seen in figure [ compact_radex ] , by fitting the mid - j lines ( from j@xmath1 = 9 to j@xmath1 = 13 ) together with the low - j lines observed with interferometric techniques , which isolate the cnd component , and subtracting the contribution from the medium excitation ( me ) component of the lvg model of @xcite .",

    "@xcite have used interferometric co ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) observations to derive a mass of the cnd (  ring `` in co ( 2 - 1 ) , in their terminology , of @xmath9200  pc in radius ) of m(h@xmath118 ) @xmath9",

    "these two mass estimates are a factor 2 times larger than our estimates ; however , this discrepancy is fully justified by the difference in the gas excitation , as the co ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) lines are mapping lower temperature gas .",
    "we then compare our findings with the temperature of t@xmath76145  k and mass derived from the h@xmath118 pure rotational transitions of @xcite ; from the detection of the s(1 ) line @xcite a warm gas mass of m(h@xmath118 ) @xmath9 10@xmath194  m@xmath192 is derived in the sws beam of 14@xmath24 @xmath20 27@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our findings , given the difference in beam size between the two spectrometers .",
    "using ngc1068 as a template to predict the submillimetre spectrum of higher redshift galaxies , we have estimated the expected line fluxes as a function of redshift , rescaling the total infrared luminosity of ngc1068 to the value of l@xmath18=10@xmath25l@xmath192 .",
    "we show in figure  [ ccat](a ) the observed fluxes of atomic and molecular lines of ngc1068 from the iso - lws spectrometer @xcite , from the pacs spectrometer @xcite , and those from this work , and compare them with the predicted fluxes at redshift of z=0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 and 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 .",
    "we also show in the figure the 5@xmath36 1 hour sensitivities of future observing facilities , such as ccat and spica - safari and compare them with the sensitivities of the _ herschel _   spectrometers .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for a brief description of spica and ccat and for the details of the expected sensitivities of the foreseen spectrometers at their focal planes .",
    "we also show in figure  [ ccat](b ) , for comparison with ngc1068 , the observed and predicted submillimetre spectra of other important local template galaxies , the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 and the ulirg arp220 , that have been observed with the spire spectrometer ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ ccat ] that the intermediate to high - j co lines , as well as the two [ ci ] lines , are weaker by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared to the brightest far - ir fine structure lines of [ cii ] _ and [ nii]_. however , their powerful diagnostic potential , in terms of detecting through xdr regions the effect of an agn in the host galaxy , combined with their long wavelengths , makes these lines very attractive for high redshift spectroscopic cosmological surveys from ground - based telescopes",
    ". the expected sensitivity of future spectrometers at the focal plane of large submillimetre telescopes , such as ccat , will be able to detect an object like ngc1068 , m82 , or arp220 with a luminosity of l=10@xmath25l@xmath192 at a redshift of z=0.2 - 0.5 .",
    "we summarize here the results of this work .",
    "the first complete submillimetre ( 190670  @xmath0 m ) spectrum of the seyfert type 2 galaxy ngc1068 reveals the full sequence of co pure rotational lines from j@xmath1=4 to j@xmath1=13 .",
    "the radiation transfer analysis of these lines shows the presence of two physically distinct components : the first one originating from the circum - nuclear disk ( cnd ) of few arcseconds in diameter ( @xmath9 4@xmath24 ) and the second one excited in the star forming ring ( sf - ring ) with a diameter ten times larger ( @xmath9 40@xmath24 ) .",
    "these results indicate a kinetic temperature of co of @xmath8=100  k and 127  k , a gas density of @xmath4=@xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 and a derived molecular hydrogen mass of m(h@xmath118 ) @xmath9 2.4@xmath2010@xmath191  m@xmath192 and m(h@xmath118 ) @xmath9 3.5@xmath2010@xmath194  m@xmath192 , for the compact and extended regions , respectively .",
    "the comparison of the observed co line intensities with predictions of photodissociation ( pdr ) and x - ray dominated regions ( xdr ) models shows that the circum - nuclear disk emission can be modeled equally well by both types of models , while the co lines in the star - forming ring can be modeled by a photodissociation region only .",
    "however some observational constraints , such as the total co surface brightness and the required radiation field , indicate that the most plausible explanation for the co excitation of the cnd is an xdr with density of n(h@xmath2 ) @xmath9 10@xmath10 @xmath7 and x - ray flux of 9 erg  s@xmath11  @xmath12 , consistent with the agn illumination . in contrast , the excitation of the sf - ring component is due to pdr emission originating from the young stars / hii regions in the spiral arms .",
    "the water lines that we have detected with spire , together with those observed by pacs ( s. hailey - dunsheath 2012 , private comm . ) , have been modeled with an lvg model to constrain the physical conditions of the water excitation .",
    "we have found that the kinetic temperature is t@xmath39=40  k , the molecular hydrogen density is @xmath195 and the column density is of order n(h@xmath2o)=8 @xmath196 @xmath12 for both water forms .",
    "the molecular masses that we derived from our analysis are in good agreement with the masses estimated from both co interferometric measurements of low - j lines and mid - infrared h@xmath2 emission lines .",
    "finally we show that the intermediate - j co and [ ci ] lines in galaxies with l@xmath198 can be observed from planned and future ground - based and space telescopes up to redshift of z @xmath9 0.5 , making their diagnostic power an important tool to study galaxy evolution at intermediate redshift .",
