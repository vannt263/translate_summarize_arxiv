    "we conclude that @xmath403 , that is , @xmath73 is also a convex curve .

    "if @xmath19 evolves by the mean curvature flow , theorem [ tf ] ensures us that we can parametrize @xmath11 and @xmath413 by and @xmath414 respectively , where @xmath261 is a family of curves in @xmath38 satisfying and having two loops that we will denote @xmath415 and @xmath416 .",
    "the initial restrictions on the areas enclosed by @xmath417 imply that the areas @xmath418 and @xmath419 , enclosed by the curves @xmath415 and @xmath416 respectively , @xmath420 .",
