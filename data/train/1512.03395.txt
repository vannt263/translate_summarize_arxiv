    "the first ebola outbreak took place in 1976 in congo , close to ebola river , from where the disease takes its name . since august 2014 , it is affecting several countries in west of africa , mainly guinea , sierra leone , and liberia @xcite .",
    "nowadays , ebola is one of the most deadliest pathogens for humans , due to the extremely rapid increase of the disease and the high mortality rate .",
    "several authors consider the virus a health and humanitarian catastrophe of historic scope @xcite .    in a first stage",
    ", ebola virus is characterised by the sudden onset of fever , intense weakness , headache , fatigue , and muscle pain .",
    "this is followed by vomiting blood and passive behaviour .",
    "the second stage is characterised by diarrhea , rash , symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function , and both internal and external bleeding ( bleeding from nose , mouth , eyes and anus ) @xcite . in a third / final stage ,",
    "the symptoms are summarized in a loss of consciousness , seizures , massive internal bleeding , followed by death @xcite .",
    "ebola spreads through human - to - human transmission via close and direct physical contact ( through broken skin or mucous membranes ) with infected bodily fluids .",
    "the most infectious fluids are blood , feces , and vomit secretions .",
    "however , all body fluids have the capacity to transmit the ebola .",
    "the virus is also transmitted indirectly via exposure to objects or an environment contaminated with infected secretions .",
    "for all these reasons , health care workers practice strict infection prevention and control precautions when dealing with ebola cases .",
    "in epidemiology , mathematical models are a key tool for the understanding of the dynamics of infectious diseases and the impact of vaccination programmes .",
    "in fact , mathematics has an important role in the control of propagation of virus , allowing policymakers to predict the impact of particular vaccine programmes or to derive more efficient strategies based on mathematical insights ",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , optimal control theory has become in last years a powerful mathematical tool that can assess the intervention of public health authorities .",
    "indeed , the inclusion , in an epidemic model , of some practical control strategies , like vaccines , social distancing , or quarantine , provides a rational basis for policies , designed to control the spread of a virus @xcite . in this spirit",
    ", we focus our work on the investigation of effective strategies to control the spread of the ebola virus by setting optimal control problems subject to a sir epidemic model .",
    "two practical control strategies are here considered : vaccines or educational campaigns and treatment .",
    "the sir model , on which our optimal control studies are based , divides the population into three groups : the susceptible ( s ) , the infected ( i ) , and the recovered ( r ) @xcite .",
    "this model is simulated by rachah and torres in their study of the spread of the recent outbreak of ebola virus @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we present a mathematical model that describes the dynamics of the propagation of the ebola virus into a population . after the mathematical modelling , we use the obtained model to discuss it in section  [ sec:3 ] under several control strategies for the propagation of the virus . in these strategies",
    ", we use parameters estimated from recent statistical data based on the who ( world health organization ) report of the 2014 ebola outbreak @xcite .",
    "first , we study the case of control through a vaccination strategy ( section  [ subsec:3.2 ] ) ; secondly , we consider educational campaigns as a control , coupled with a treatment strategy ( section  [ subsec:3.3 ] ) .",
    "our results improve the recent investigations of @xcite , briefly summarized in section  [ subsec:3.1 ] .",
    "we end with section  [ subsec:3.5 ] of discussion of results , and section  [ sec:4 ] of conclusions and future work .",
    "in this section we present , mathematically , the dynamics of the population infected by the ebola virus .",
    "the dynamics is described by a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "this system is based on the common sir ( susceptible  infectious  recovered ) epidemic model , where the population is divided into three disjoint compartments : susceptible individuals @xmath0 , i.e. , people who can catch the virus ; infectious individuals @xmath1 , i.e. , people who are infected by the virus and can transmit it ; and recovered individuals @xmath2 , i.e. , people who have recovered from the virus .",
    "the total population , assumed constant during the period of time under study , is given by @xmath3 .",
    "ebola spreads through human - to - human transmission via contact .",
    "the transition between different states is described by the following two parameters : the infection rate @xmath4 and the recovered rate @xmath5 .",
    "the dynamics of the model is governed by the following system of differential equations : @xmath6 \\dfrac{di(t)}{dt } =   \\beta s(t)i(t)- \\mu i(t),\\\\[0.30 cm ] \\dfrac{dr(t)}{dt } =   \\mu i(t ) .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] the first equation of the system describes the population of the susceptible group , which reduces as the infected come into contact with them with a rate of infection @xmath4 .",
    "this means that the change in the population of susceptible is equal to the negative product of @xmath4 with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the second equation describes the infectious group over time , knowing that the population of this group changes in two ways : ( i ) people leave the susceptible group and join the infected group , thus adding to the total population of infected a term @xmath7 ; ( ii ) people leave the infected group and join the recovered group , reducing the infected population by @xmath8 .",
    "the third equation describes the recovered population , which is based on the individuals recovered from the virus at a rate @xmath5 .",
    "this means that the recovered group is increased by @xmath5 multiplied by @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamical system can be represented graphically as in figure  [ sir_fig1 ] .",
    "optimal control techniques are of great importance in developing optimal strategies to control various kind of diseases and epidemics @xcite . for instance , to address the challenges of obtaining an optimal vaccination strategy , one can use optimal control theory @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we formulate three optimal control problems subject to the sir model , with the aim to derive optimal strategies . for each strategy",
    ", we study a specific objective in order to minimize not only the number of infected individuals and the systemic costs of vaccination or treatment , but also to include educational campaigns within the control program .",
    "the integration of educational campaigns has a great importance in countries that do nt have the capacity to defend themselves against the virus .",
    "we compare the result of each strategy with the simulation results studied by rachah and torres in @xcite , the so called strategy  1 , which is briefly summarized in section  [ subsec:3.1 ] .",
    "strategies  2 and  @xmath9 are an improvement of strategy  1 , and are given in sections  [ subsec:3.2 ] and [ subsec:3.3 ] , respectively . more precisely , strategy  3 consists in the study of an educational campaign ( about the virus ) coupled with a treatment program .",
    "the comparison between the different strategies and the simulation results is given in section  [ subsec:3.5 ] .",
    "for the numerical solutions of the optimal control problems , we have used the solver @xcite , which is based on a multiple shooting method , including automatic differentiation and based ultimately on the semidirect multiple shooting algorithm of bock and pitt @xcite .",
    "the solver comes as a self - contained public domain software environment , written in , for automatic control and dynamic optimization .      in this subsection ,",
    "we recall briefly the strategy studied by rachah and torres in @xcite .",
    "we will improve it later by studying other strategies in order to better control the propagation of the spread of ebola into populations .",
    "in their study , rachah and torres @xcite studied the sir model with control , which is given by the following system of nonlinear differential equations : @xmath10 \\dfrac{di(t)}{dt } = \\beta s(t)i(t ) - \\mu i(t),\\\\[0.3 cm ] \\dfrac{dr(t)}{dt } = \\mu i(t ) + u(t ) s(t ) .",

    "we take @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 days .",
    "our goal in this strategy is to reduce the number of susceptible and infected individuals and simultaneously increase the number of recovered individuals .",
    "precisely , our optimal control problem consists of minimizing the objective functional @xmath20 dt\\ ] ] subject to the model described by .",
    "the two first terms in the functional objective represent benefit of @xmath0 and @xmath1 populations that we wish to reduce ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are positive constants to keep a balance in the size of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . in our simulations we used @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the third term represents the recovered individuals , which we wish to increase through vaccination ( @xmath25 is a positive constant , chosen in the simulations as @xmath26 ) . in the quadratic term of",
    ", @xmath27 is a positive weight parameter associated with the control @xmath12 , and the square of the control variable reflects the severity of the side effects of the vaccination . in our numerical results we took @xmath28 .",

    "note that in this strategy , the control variable @xmath12 is the percentage of susceptible individuals being vaccinated per unit of time .",
    "note also that in the equation @xmath32 , we have the term @xmath33 .",
    "then , by minimizing the number of susceptible , the number of recovered ( described by equation @xmath34 , which depends on @xmath35 ) is maximized ( through vaccination ) . in the numerical simulations of model and the strategy of the optimal control problem , rachah and torres",
    "@xcite used the who data of the 2014 ebola outbreak occurred in guinea , in sierra leone , and in liberia @xcite . in order to compare our improvement of the optimal control study with the previous results of @xcite , we use here the same parameters , that is , the same rate of infection @xmath16 , the same recovered rate @xmath17 , and the same initial values @xmath36 for the initial number of susceptible , infected , and recovered populations ( at the beginning , 95% of population is susceptible and 5% is infected with ebola ) .",
