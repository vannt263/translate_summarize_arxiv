    "in theory of dynamical systems and nonlinear analysis quite a number of problems depending on parameters require analyzing the structure of the set of solutions of nonlinear equations , the number of variables in which exceeds the number of equations . as a rule , arising equations are rather complicated for investigation and need to be simplified in one or another way .",
    "clearly , such `` simplification '' may lead as to correct conclusions about the structure of solutions as to wrong ones",
    ". often , small solutions of equations are of interest . in this case one of the most popular methods of simplification of equations is their truncation , when one casts out high order terms in power - series expansions of the corresponding equations . in the paper polynomial",

[ extrunk ]",
    "let us discard in the next equations @xmath17 the terms of order higher than @xmath18 , that is perform the @xmath18-truncation of the left - hand parts .",
    "then the truncated equation @xmath19 has a single solution , @xmath20 .",
    "the first of the full equations also has the same single solution , @xmath20 , while the second of the full equations has a continuum of solutions , @xmath21 .",
