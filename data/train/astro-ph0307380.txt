    "there is growing evidence that the classification of galactic nuclei based on their optical spectra alone provides an incomplete and sometimes deceiving description of their true nature . indeed , some `` classical '' starburst galaxies show signatures of a hidden active galactic nucleus ( agn ) at non - optical wavelengths .",
    "the most convincing evidence for obscured agn hidden in starburst nuclei comes from x - ray observations .",
    "the prototype of this class of objects is ngc4945 which hosts a powerful nuclear starburst , identified through emission in the br@xmath1 and pa@xmath2 lines and through its mid - ir spectrum @xcite .",
    "the observations indicate that a starburst superwind has created a large cavity where shocked clouds emit faint liner - type lines .",
    "studies at optical and near - ir wavelengths reveal no evidence for an agn in this galaxy .",
    "however , x - ray observations unambiguously prove the presence of a powerful and heavily obscured agn : the 2 - 10 kev spectrum shows a reflection - dominated component with a prominent fe line , while the intrinsic transmitted component is observed as a strong , variable excess in the range 10 - 100 kev @xcite .",
    "similar cases are ngc6240 ( vignati et al . 1999 ) , which has an optical spectrum very similar to that of ngc4945 ( i.e. weak liner - type lines probably associated with the starburst superwind shocks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ngc3690 @xcite which has an hii - type optical spectrum . in all three galaxies ,",
    "x - ray observations clearly indicate the presence of an obscured active nucleus , yet their optical spectra show no signs of the `` classical '' seyfert - type emission lines .",
    "we define `` optically elusive agns '' , or simply `` elusive agns '' , those objects which do not show a seyfert - like spectrum in the optical , but which host a hard x - ray nuclear source whose intrinsic luminosity is in the seyfert range , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , elusive agn are generally hosted in nuclei optically classified either as hii or liner .",
    "we emphasize that a liner spectrum does not necessarily imply the presence of an agn with seyfert - like luminosity .",
    "for instance , most low - luminosity nuclei studied by @xcite with classical liner spectra are intrinsically much weaker than classical seyferts ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "alternatively , liner spectra may originate in starburst - driven shocks @xcite and therefore be totally unrelated with the presence of an agn .",
    "an object with a liner - like spectrum but @xmath3 will be therefore considered as an elusive agn .",
    "we have started a program to search for elusive agn in starburst galaxies using infrared , radio and x - ray observations . in this paper , we present the results of a small set of chandra observations . in combination with literature x - ray data for other galaxies ,",
    "we derive a first estimate of the fraction of elusive agns in the local universe and attempt to constrain their nature .",
    "the parent sample consists of all non - seyfert galaxies ( typically starburst with hii or liner spectra ) which show a high brightness temperature ( @xmath5k ) in the vlbi observations obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the selection based on the presence of a radio core was made to maximize the chance of finding an elusive agn .",
    "indeed , most seyfert nuclei show a compact radio core with brightness temperature higher than @xmath6k .",
    "however , brightness temperatures even in excess of @xmath7k can also be achieved by compact radio sne @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of a radio core alone is not a proof for the presence of an agn .",
    "@xcite selected nearby galaxies ( z@xmath80.025 ) from the iras catalog with luminosity @xmath9 ( most of these have @xmath10 ) , and warm infrared colours : @xmath11 _ and _ @xmath12 . the warm colours are expected to favor the selection of galaxies hosting agn .",
    "the kewley et al .",
    "sample contains 61 galaxies , 48 of which were observed with the parkes tidbinbilla interferometer ( pti ) .",
    "pti detections imply @xmath13 k.    @xcite selected the 40 most luminous galaxies in the iras bright galaxy sample ( @xmath14 ) and observed with the vlbi the subsample of the 31 galaxies with best vla compact fluxes .",
    "detections with the vlbi generally identify higher brightness temperatures ( @xmath15  k in several cases ) .",
    "since , by definition , elusive agn can not be identified through the classical diagnostic diagrams involving optical line ratios , we have to rely on x - ray  based classification schemes .",
    "we infer the presence of an agn if one of the following conditions is met .",
    "i ) for compton - thin agn : an absorption - corrected x - ray _ nuclear _ luminosity of @xmath3 and a spectrum that can be described by an absorbed powerlaw with agn - like slope ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "ii ) for compton - thick agn : a flat x - ray spectrum ( powerlaw with @xmath17 ) in the case of cold reflection was chosen because most cold - reflection dominated , compton - thick sources are in this range @xcite and also to discard ulxs , which have @xmath18 @xcite . ] , and/or an fe line at 6.4 - 6.7  kev with equivalent width ( ew ) in excess of 500 ev , and/or the direct detection of the agn emission at e@xmath1910kev ( e.g. ngc4945 ) .",
    "this definition is not as well - defined as the one adopted for the optical identification of seyfert nuclei , and is subject to some ambiguities , as discussed below .",
    "we have used chandra / acis - s to search for elusive agn in four galaxies of our parent sample , namely ugc2369 , ngc2623 , ngc4418 , and ngc4691 .",
    "in addition , we include acis - s observations of ngc2993 which were serendipitously obtained during observations of the companion ngc2992 ( colbert et al . in prep ) .",
    "the data were reduced using ciao v.2.3 , following standard procedures .",
    "table  [ tab_chandra ] gives a short observation log . in all cases ,",
    "the nuclear x - ray source discussed here lies within 1@xmath20 of the position of the radio core or the near - ir peak , and thus can confidently be identified with the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the x - ray fluxes from the nuclear sources are too weak to perform a detailed spectral analysis . for our analyses we used the c - statistics which is more appropriate in the case of low signal - to - noise data @xcite .",
    "the weakest sources were fit with a simple power - law using a column density n@xmath21 fixed to the galactic value .",
    "for the brighter sources , the fit was improved by including a thermal component and/or by varying the value of intrinsic n@xmath21 .",
    "a summary of the best fit for each source is given in table  [ tab_chandra ] .",
    "ngc2623 is the only source which unambiguously meets the above criteria for the presence of an obscured agn , since its very flat hard x - ray spectrum can only be explained by the presence of a compton - thick , cold reflection dominated agn ( fig.1 ) .",
    "our data constrain the ew of the fe line to an upper limit of 1  kev .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than in typical compton - thick agn , but not unusual among other elusive agn such as ngc4945 ( bassani et al .",
    "1999 ) or ngc3690 @xcite .",
    "an absorbed powerlaw with @xmath22 frozen to 1.9 gives a much worse fit .",
    "ngc4418 also shows evidence for a flat spectrum emission component which may imply the presence of a compton - thick agn , but the limited photon statistics make this identification somewhat tentative .",
    "we note , however , that infrared observations also suggest the presence of a heavily obscured agn in this galaxy @xcite .",
    "also in this case , an absorbed powerlaw with @xmath22 frozen to 1.9 gives a significantly worse fit .",
