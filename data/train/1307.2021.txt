    "note that the scaling by 53% is somewhat uncertain ; since the @xmath18 selection might preferentially retain white dwarfs based on their bluer color than the general population , but also might preferentially throw out white dwarfs because they are fainter than the general population , we chose to simply use the fraction of stars retained by the @xmath18 selection .",

    "the current work is to disentangle white dwarfs from other types of stars in similar parameter space .",
    "since the best leverage is the surface gravity , we can therefore apply the same srsic profile fitted parameters that are sensitive to gravity .    for high temperature targets such as wds ,",
    "the blue arm of lamost spectra is usually better than the red arm , therefore the line profile fitting is applied only to h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 .",

    "the entire spectrum is first normalized by the spline fitting .",
    "the spectrum is almost flat but the normalization is rough .",
    "so each of the balmer line is then normalized locally by using pre - determined wavelength ranges on either side of the lines and fitting to a linear function .",
    "the wavelength ranges are chosen to be suitable for the broad balmer lines in white dwarfs .",
    "the wavelength ranges for h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 local normalization are ( 4681 - 4741   , 4981 - 5041   ) , ( 4201 - 4241   , 4441 - 4481   ) and ( 4031 - 4061   , 4171 - 4201   ) , respectively .",

    "an @xmath71 close to unity indicates that the model data are very close to the real data and the model fits the data set well , while an @xmath71 close to 0 means that the model does not fit the data .",

    "the upper panels show the balmer lines ( solid ) and the best fit of srsic profile ( dashed ) for an f star and the lower panels are for a dawd .",
    "the balmer lines are prominent in spectra of stars within a surface temperature range around 10,000 k ( a type stars ) . for stars with much higher ( b type ) or lower temperatures ( g type and later ) , the balmer lines are no longer dominant and even invisible .",
    "there are also qsos in the input catalog .",
    "since the balmer line profile fitting may fail for these spectra , we first eliminated spectra without apparent balmer lines , using constraints of rms and @xmath71 . figure 8 shows the correlation between @xmath76 and rms of lamost pilot spectra with @xmath22 .",

    "this temperature index is determined by visually comparing the target spectrum with spectra of different temperature indices in the atlas of wesemael et al .",

    "we select three targets to show different image quality of lamost spectra . from top to bottom , the @xmath19 magnitudes of the three dawds are @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , with lamost g - band @xmath18 ratios of 45.7 , 19.5 , and 13.7 , respectively . the black lines are lamost spectra and the red lines are sdss spectra .",

    "the continuum of the lamost spectrum in the bottom panel is clearly different from that of the sdss spectrum .",
    "this is likely because the low @xmath18 at the blue end affected the flux calibration .",
    "the positions of dawds are presented in figure 1 as red dots ( bright survey ) and green dots ( dark survey ) .",
    "247 dawds and dawd / subdwarfs are from bright survey and 112 from dark survey ( one of them was targeted by both the bright and dark survey ) .",

    "a few of the dawds with @xmath93 might be mistakes of cross - identification or they are heavily reddened stars .",
    "the reason this can not be clarified currently is because of the variety of input catalog sources .",
    "if the red colors are due to extinction , finding white dwarfs by their spectra , then using multi - band synthetic magnitudes to derive galactic extinction would be valuable .",
    "this has been done in holberg et al .",

    "the continua of some other spectra are not significantly bimodal , but the line widths of shorter wavelength ( h@xmath2 , h@xmath1 ) and longer wavelength lines ( h@xmath40 , sometimes caii triplets ) are different .",
    "it means the white dwarfs may have non - degenerate companions with slightly redder color .",
    "figure 16 shows examples of the two features above .",
    "there are several interesting spectra that have emission lines in the cores of absorption lines of h@xmath40 and even h@xmath1 .",
    "most of these spectra are targets classified as  da:/sd \"",
    ". they may not be dawds .",
    "but these stars may undergo an interesting process .",
    "figure 17 presents some of these spectra with emission lines .",
    "the arrangement of bright and dark plates in the pilot survey is mainly determined by the weather conditions and moon phase at the lamost site . in 5 years of lamost",
    "regular survey , legue will observe more than 7.5 million stars in the galaxy @xmath98 6 times larger than observed in the pilot survey .",
    "if the magnitude limits can be extended down to 19.5 after further tuning of the instruments , @xmath60 da white dwarf spectra can be obtained in a year .",
    "spectra of at least 7,000 dawds will be obtained with more than 60% of them are in the disk and galactic anticenter region .",
    "note that @xmath99 dawd spectra were obtained from sdss dr7 , twice the number expected from lamost .",
    "this is due to the different target selection method .",
    "segue selected all white dwarf candidates by the color selection criteria in yanny et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , while lamost overselects rare targets by a well - defined selection algorithm . in sky areas with much higher stellar number density ,",
    "@xmath100 of dawd candidates are targeted ( see the results for high galactic latitude dark case and low galactic latitude dark case in table 2 ) . however , with the known target selection function , the color and magnitude distribution of all dawds can be estimated .",
    "the distribution of the overall sample of dawds in a certain sky area will be obtained . however ,",
    "when the dawd candidate sample becomes much larger , the visual inspection and identification will be inefficient .",
    "an automatic numerical process , like the sdss white dwarf template matching method , is needed .",
    "such a technique will allow us to obtain the stellar parameters of the white dwarfs .",
    "eventually , we will develop an algorithm to carry out matching of template spectra based on model atmosphere grids to derive atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath101 , log g , mass , age , etc . ) for the dawds we identified by our technique . when combined with kinematic information such as the radial velocity and proper motion",
    ", the catalog of dawds in legue survey will be a valuable mine to study the formation , evolution and kinematics of the galactic disk and disentangle the mixture of the thin disk , the thick disk and the spheroid populations .",
    "the typical feature of dawds is broad balmer lines . for balmer lines of higher level than h@xmath2 ,",
    "the lines become weaker due to the blanketing effect .",
    "however , the line width of dawds of lower surface gravity are similar to a - type stars and subdwarfs . and the line width of dawds with lower temperatures are narrower , as the hydrogen lines narrow with decreasing temperatures because of the stark effect ( gray & corbally 2009 ) . in this case , the caii h / k and caii triplets are investigated .",
    "spectra with strong caii k are classified as a stars and removed from the candidate list . in the early a - type stars , caii triplets are weaker than the paschen lines , but in late a - type stars the caii triplets become dominant .",
    "it can also be a feature to recognize a - type stars .",
    "the spectra of subdwarfs are with no clear metallic lines , relatively narrow balmer lines ( @xmath102 ) and narrow hellium lines for some of them .    here",
    "we present some spectra examples to show how dawds are separated from a - type stars and subdwarfs in figure 18 .",
    "the first plot is the spectrum of an a - type star .",
    "it shows caii k line at the blue end and caii triplets in the red end .",
    "the h@xmath103 seems much stronger than other balmer lines because the caii h line is mixed with it .",
    "the second plot is the spectrum of a subdwarf .",
    "it shows hei @xmath104 , 4387 , 4471     and the caii k line .",

    "da3 : \" white dwarf .",
    "the sky subtraction in the red end is problematic but the broad balmer lines and the weakening line depth of higher level lines indicate it is a dawd .",
