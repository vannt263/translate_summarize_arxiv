    ", the excitations depend less on specific nuclear structure and start to exhibit more common features among ( heavy ) nuclei .",
    "these features are expected to be reasonably well represented by excitations of nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , dynamics of supernovae and neutron stars , which have been of much astronomical interest , are expected to be better understood through the study of excitations of neutron matter @xcite .",

    "applications of the traditional nuclear many - body theories regarding nucleon matter at zero temperature have been extensive @xcite , and provide the most reliable information on the properties of nucleon matter at low temperatures .",
    "previously , one of us ( r.  s. ) has collaborated on a monte carlo calculation of nuclear matter on a lattice @xcite , which provides a new framework for studying the thermal properties of nucleon matter .",
    "though the computational space was small and the nucleon - nucleon interaction was simple , the calculation has proven to be of much promise , demonstrating the occurrence of a phase transition around 15 mev using the parameters adjusted to reproduce the saturation properties",
    ". a similar calculation of nucleon matter of a single species has also been initiated in the same work , using the same form of the hamiltonian . though a phase transition appeared to take place at a few mev , the evidence for it was not quite solid owing to statistical fluctuations , which are enhanced at low temperature ( a sign problem ) .",
    "the phase transitions may correspond to those expected through paired nucleons ( cooper pairs ) in nucleon matter @xcite .    in order to gain a better understanding of the possible , latter phase transition , we apply in this work the analytic means of a mean field approach to the problem in the same lattice formulation . from this work",

    "our hamiltonian for single - species nucleon matter turns out to be an extended , attractive hubbard model , which has been studied as a simple model of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the mean field calculation shows that the low - temperature , low - density state is a superfluid state and undergoes a continuous ( second - order ) phase transition to the normal state as the temperature and/or density increases . as the hamiltonian is not yet fully realistic and the values of the interaction parameters are uncertain , our results are not quite comparable to those for neutron matter , except perhaps at a very low density .",
    "but we demonstrate that the approach is promising for the study of low - density neutron matter .    furthermore , we find that a density - wave state coexists with the superfluid state , suggesting that the state of neutron matter may be more complicated than the simple description of a superfluid state as it is often characterized .",

    "i is to understand the essential physics associated with the thermal properties of nucleon matter , but our finding in this work is limited in this sense and is perhaps most applicable to low - density neutron matter .",

    "a mean field approximation ignores most features of particle correlations .",
    "as the particle correlations are the vital ingredient of critical phenomena , the mean field approximation is generally believed to be only of qualitative use , and some times not even qualitative , as fluctuations could alter the nature of the phase transition .",

    "our hamiltonian has a form similar to that of the skyrme interaction @xcite ( though ours is a truncated form . )",
    "the skyrme interaction is one of the effective interactions that are phenomenologically introduced to achieve quantitative agreement with experiments , usually by the use of a mean field approximation such as the hartree - fock calculations . though it is still not quite realistic , our hamiltonian has a justification in this sense . a lattice calculation such as the previous monte carlo lattice calculation @xcite , however , accounts for all the complexity of the many - body interaction with no approximation other than the numerical , in the lattice framework .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction used in it should not be then an effective interaction like the skyrme interaction , but an interaction in free space .",
    "the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath37 are expected to be determined from scattering data through the use of effective field theory by extending lscher s formula @xcite for the large @xmath164 scattering length .",

    "thermodynamic variables show their dependence on the temperature and density variations as expected under the phase transition in the mean field approach .",
