    "the multifunctionality and relative simplicity of plant cells is a marvel . unlike humans and animals",
    ", plants do not possess a centralized skeleton and complex control system . yet",
    "they can create their own food through photosynthesis , reproduce , carry considerable external loads and in some cases are even capable of rapid movements .",
    "this article is concerned with the nastic movement of plants as known , for example , from mimosa pudica and dionaea muscipula .",
    "the focus is particularly on cell geometries and material properties of cell walls .",
    "cell walls carry considerable loads due to turgor pressures of up to 5  mpa @xcite .",
    "the resulting prestress increases their compression strength and thus has a positive impact on a plants overall stiffness .",
    "hence it could be argued that plants possess a decentralized skeleton that is formed by a large number of connected pressure vessels . in order to withstand the relatively high tensile stresses ,",
    "cell walls are made from a composite material as shown in figure  [ pic : figure_1 ] .",
    "most of the tensile stresses are carried by the primary cell wall .",
    "it is made from a network of microfibrils that are connected to each other by hemicellulose tethers .",
    "this network is embedded in a pectin matrix , a hydrated gel that pushes the microfibrils apart , thus easing their sideways motion @xcite .",
    "this allows plants to continuously optimize their cell wall properties and thus to maximize stiffness and minimize stress peaks for given loads @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the young s modulus of cell walls increases with tensile stresses and volume changes of cells due to elastic deformations are negligible @xcite .",
    "the nastic movement of plants is driven by pressure changes that require a water flow between neighbouring cells @xcite .",
    "skotheim and mahadevan  @xcite found that the speed of plant movements increases for decreasing cell sizes and pumping distances . ] .",
    "consequently it is best if water fluxes occur mainly between neighbouring cell layers .",
    "nastic movements are only a small aspect of a plants capabilities .",
    "hence a cells construction principle is influenced by numerous alternative objectives .",
    "in contrast , an exclusive focus on the nastic movement reduces the number of objectives and thus increases the range of potential cell - sizes , -materials and -pressures . based on these observations , pagitz et al developed a novel concept for pressure actuated cellular structures that can alter their shape between any given set of one- @xcite , @xcite and two - dimensional @xcite functions .",
    "an example of a cellular structure for two one- and two - dimensional target shapes is shown in figure  [ pic : figure_2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that both structures consist of two layers of equally pressurized cells . changing the pressure ratio between cell layers",
    "alters the shape of the structure .",
    "computing the length and thickness of each cell side allows the creation of structures that can take up any target shape for given cell pressures and material properties . pressure actuated cellular structures possess a large shape changing capability and a high strength to self - weight ratio and energy efficiency .",
    "hence their potential application ranges from passenger seats and hospital beds to leading and trailing edges of aircraft .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : analytical expressions for optimal materials of compliant cellular structures with identical properties are derived as a function of cell sizes in _",
    "section  2_. furthermore , the relationship between cell - sizes , -materials and -pressures is investigated .",
    "_ section  3 _ presents extensions to the previously published numerical model and determines their application ranges . _",
    "section  4 _ introduces two end cap designs for prismatic cells that can withstand substantial differential pressure while being flexible enough to allow large cross sectional shape changes .",
    "furthermore , a manufacturing approach that is based on cytoskeletons is presented .",
    "_ section  5 _ concludes the paper .",
    "cell sides of pressure actuated cellular structures have to carry large axial forces .",
    "furthermore , boundary sides or sides between cell layers require an increased central bending stiffness due to differential pressures . both , axial forces and an increased central thicknesses promote regions around cell corners where bending strains are concentrated .",
    "these localization allow the use of numerical models that are based on rigid bars , eccentric cell corner hinges and rotational springs as shown in figure  [ pic : figure_3 ] .",
    "the geometry of compliant cellular structures is relatively complex .",
    "consequently , a detailed finite element model is required to accurately compute equivalent cell corner springs and hinge eccentricities . in order to simplify matters",
    "it is subsequently assumed that regions of concentrated bending strains can be approximated by rectangular continua with linearized stress distributions as shown in figure  [ pic : figure_4 ] .",
    "an equivalent rotational spring stiffness @xmath0 can be computed for a rectangular continuum by using the euler - bernoulli beam theory so that    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the young s modulus , @xmath3 the thickness and @xmath4 the ratio between length and thickness of a rectangular continuum .",
    "the corresponding bending moment @xmath5 for a bending angle @xmath6 is    @xmath7    so that the absolute axial @xmath8 and maximum bending @xmath9 stresses of a rectangular continuum are    @xmath10    therefore , the required thickness of a rectangular continuum is    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the yield strength of the considered material .",
    "the bending moment and energy of an elastic region is    @xmath13    the required thickness of a central cell side is subsequently determined .",
    "equilibrium requires transverse forces @xmath14 at both ends so that    @xmath15    where it is assumed for the sake of simplicity that hinge eccentricities @xmath16 are constant throughout a cellular structure . the bending moment @xmath17 along a central cell side due to end moments and differential",
    "pressure @xmath18 is    @xmath19    where @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding absolute axial and bending stresses are    @xmath21    hence the required cell side thickness is    @xmath22    all cell sides that are subjected to a non - zero differential pressure possess a varying thickness .",
    "however , an average thickness @xmath23 can be computed that possesses an identical axial stiffness    @xmath24      potential materials for pressure actuated cellular structures range from plastics over fiber reinforced plastics to metals .",
    "the yield strength @xmath25 and young s modulus @xmath2 of various materials is shown in figure  [ pic : figure_5 ] .",
    "the material parameters that are subsequently considered are dyed in black and summarized in table  [ tab : material ] .",
    "note that these materials possess outstandingly large @xmath26 ratios .",

    "] can be interpolated with a power law so that    @xmath27    where @xmath28 $ ] is a stress safety factor . based on a least square interpolation",
    "the constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 are    @xmath31    previous interpolation can be used to derive expressions that relate geometry and loading of a cell side to optimal material parameters .",
    "the bending energy @xmath32 of a rectangular continuum is    @xmath33    which is minimal if    @xmath34    so that    @xmath35    and    @xmath36    hence the bending moment that acts on a rectangular continuum is    @xmath37    and the required cell side thickness at a cell corner for an axial force @xmath38 and bending angle @xmath6 is    @xmath39    previous three equations are illustrated in figure  [ pic : figure_6 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the optimal young s modulus decreases exponentially for increasing bending angles .",
    "furthermore , bending energy and required cell side thickness decrease exponentially for decreasing bending angles .",
    "each rectangular continuum of a rectangular structure is usually subjected to a different bending angle and axial force .",
    "hence it would be optimal if every elastic zone is made from a different material .",
    "if only one material is used throughout a cellular structure it is best to choose the optimal material for the largest bending angle that occurs .",
    "this is due to the fact that elastic regions with large bending angles are dominant since @xmath40 .",
    "the number of base pentagons of a cellular structure for given target shapes and stiffness requirements is an important variable during the design process .",
    "the effects that a varying number of base pentagons has on the geometry , weight and potential energies of a cellular structure are subsequently investigated .",
    "it is assumed that all considered structures    * _ are designed for the same target shapes _ * _ possess the same overall stiffness _ * _ are made from an optimal material that minimizes bending energy .",
    "_    two cellular structures with seven and fourteen base pentagons are shown in figure  [ pic : figure_7 ] for the same two target shapes .",
    "it can be seen that doubling the number of base pentagons approximately halves the cell side lengths and bending angles . furthermore , the total number of cell sides is doubled since    @xmath41    note that @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the number of cell rows , cell sides and base pentagons .",
    "thus it can be concluded that the number of base pentagons does not affect the sum of all cell side lengths .",
    "the stiffness of a single cell is constant if its pressure potential is constant . as a consequence ,",
    "halving cell sizes and thus quartering cross sectional cell areas requires a fourfold increase in cell pressures .",
    "however , an eightfold increase in cell pressures is required to preserve the overall structural stiffness since there are now twice as many cells in each row .",
    "the scaled cell side lengths @xmath45 , bending angles @xmath46 and pressures @xmath47 can be written for a scaling factor @xmath48 as    @xmath49    thus the scaled cell side forces are    @xmath50    and the scaled pressure potential of the whole structure is    @xmath51    inserting the scaled expressions for bending angles and cell side forces into the previously derived equations for optimal material properties results in    @xmath52    and thus    @xmath53    furthermore it is assumed that the scaled hinge eccentricities are proportional to the scaled cell side thicknesses at cell corners so that    @xmath54    it can be seen that cell side thicknesses at cell corners decrease sublinear for an increasing number of base pentagons .",
    "hence , from a geometrical point of view , relative cell side thicknesses become larger for decreasing cell sizes .",
    "the scaled bending energy of a cellular structure is    @xmath55    since the number of elastic continua is proportional to the number of base pentagons .",
    "the scaled moment @xmath56 along a central cell side is    @xmath57    so that its bounds for @xmath58 are    @xmath59    and the corresponding bounds for the scaled thickness distribution along a cell side are    @xmath60    where the lower bound is determined for @xmath61 . hence it can be concluded that    @xmath62    in summary it can be said that an increasing number of base pentagons reduces the total volume of a cellular structure and increases the ratio between pressure and elastic energy .",
    "this might be an explanation for the small cell sizes and relatively large cell pressures that are found in nastic plants .",
    "figure  [ pic : figure_8 ] illustrates the previous results .",
    "reducing cell sizes while preserving the overall structural stiffness requires increasing cell pressures .",
    "gasses are the best choice for large cell volumes and small pressures whereas incompressible liquids are better for small volumes and large pressures .",
    "for example , the pressure of a given mass of gas for a varying volume @xmath63 is    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the reference pressure and volume . hence the change of pressure potential due to a volume change from @xmath66 to @xmath67 is    @xmath68    in contrast",
    ", the pressure potential of an incompressible hydraulic fluid is always zero .",
    "furthermore , the weight of air at 30  mpa exceeds 300  kg / m@xmath69 which is about one third of the weight of common hydraulic fluids .",
    "therefore , the compressibility of gasses limits the usable upper pressure for most applications to about 1  mpa due to safety and energy efficiency concerns @xcite .",
    "in contrast , hydraulic systems are often operated at pressures of up to 70  mpa .",
    "depending on the geometry , material and pressures of a cellular structure it is possible to use numerical models of varying complexity as illustrated in figure  [ pic : figure_9 ] .",
    "rigid cell sides and central , frictionless hinges at cell corners can be used if the ratio between pressure and elastic energy of a cellular structure is large .",
    "a decreasing ratio between pressure and bending energy requires the consideration of rotational springs .",
    "this can be done in a first step by assuming rotational springs around central cell corner hinges and in a second step by additionally taking into account hinge eccentricities .",
    "furthermore , a decreasing ratio between pressure and axial strain energy requires the consideration of axial strains .",
    "the influences of axial cell side strains , compliant hinges and hinge eccentricities on the equilibrium configurations of a cellular structure are subsequently studied .",
    "this is done by using an example structure that consists of two cell rows and 60 base pentagons as shown in figure  [ pic : figure_10 ] .",
    "it can be seen that all pentagonal and hexagonal cells are identical .",
    "furthermore , cell side lengths are chosen such that the structure deforms into a half , full circle for given cell pressures , rigid sides and central frictionless hinges .",
    "the reference configuration is chosen in between both equilibrium configurations to minimize changes in cell corner angles .",
    "axial cell side strains , compliant hinges or hinge eccentricities affect both equilibrium configurations .",
    "hence , deviations from the half , full circle are subsequently used to measure their impact as shown in figure  [ pic : figure_11 ] .",
    "axial strains alter cell side lengths and thus change the subtended angles of both equilibrium configurations . the numerical model used to simulate their influence",
    "is based on elastic bars and central frictionless cell corner hinges .",
    "an average thickness @xmath23 is used for cell sides with a varying thickness .",
    "it can be seen that deviations from the full circle @xmath70 are larger than from the half circle @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , all deviations decrease for an increasing young s modulus and a decreasing safety factor @xmath72 .",
    "+ compliant cell corners reduce the shape changing capability of a cellular structure . the numerical model used to simulate their influence is based on rigid bars , central frictionless cell corner hinges and rotational springs between neighbouring cell sides .",
    "the thickness of each side is optimized such that the material is fully utilized at either equilibrium configuration .",
    "the assumed aspect ratio of the rectangular continua is @xmath73 .",
    "it can be seen that deviations from both target shapes are minimal for certain young s moduli .",
    "furthermore , deviations increase for a decreasing safety factor due to increasing cell side thicknesses .",
    "+ hinge eccentricities in compliant cellular structures are due to finite cell side thicknesses at cell corners .",
    "their influence is modeled with stiff bars and frictionless hinges .",
    "to simplify matters it is assumed that hinge eccentricities @xmath16 are equal to the cell side thicknesses that were computed for the axial strain model .",
    "it can be seen that deviations from the full , half circle decrease for an increasing young s modulus and increase for a decreasing safety factor @xmath72 .",
    "in summary it can be said that deviations from both target shapes are mainly due to rotational springs and hinge eccentricities caused by compliant cell corners .",
    "furthermore , a decreasing safety factor @xmath72 increases the influence of compliant cell corners and decreases the influence of axial strains . since compliant structures are exposed to fatigue loads it is likely that safety factors @xmath74 are required .",
    "hence it can be concluded that the effect of axial strains is negligible in most applications .",
    "pressurized prismatic cells can be sealed at both ends via end caps .",
    "they have to sustain significant differential pressures while being flexible enough to allow large cross sectional shape changes .",
    "the cross sectional geometry of the pentagonal cell shown in figure  [ pic : figure_12 ] is subsequently used to study two different end cap designs .",
    "it can be seen that a reflection symmetry is assumed so that its geometry is defined by an angle @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore the width of each cell side reduces symmetrically towards the end .",
    "the region with a reduced width allows a continuous adaption between the non - uniform thicknesses of a cell side and the constant thickness of an end cap .",
    "its geometry is described by a cubic polynomial that possesses a point reflection symmetry so that    @xmath75              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath76 is the gradient of the polynomial at @xmath77 .",
    "an optimal end cap for a prismatic cell with a fixed cross sectional geometry possesses , like a soap film , an isotropic stress state .",
    "deviations from this reference configuration introduce additional , non - isotropic stresses",
    ". however , these deviations are usually small so that minimal surfaces are a good basis for end cap designs .",
    "the shapes of end caps with an isotropic stress state are computed with the updated reference strategy by bletzinger & ramm  @xcite .",
    "subsequently used parameters for end caps are summarized in table  [ tab : materialminimalsurface ] .",
    "lll + & @xmath78=1 - 2.6  mm & membrane thickness +   +   + & @xmath2=2,000  mpa & young s modulus of membrane and tendons + & @xmath79=0 & poisson s ratio of membrane + & @xmath25=30  mpa & target stress for form finding +   +   + & @xmath18=2  mpa & cell pressure + & @xmath6=@xmath800.75@xmath81 & state angle of cell geometry .",
    "the initial discretization of the cross sectional reference configuration @xmath82 , the resulting minimal surface and the corresponding stresses after ten iterations with the updated reference strategy are shown in figure  [ pic : figure_13 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the membrane and tendon stresses are nearly uniform .",
    "furthermore , the tendons carry the forces from the differential pressure directly to the cell side centers where the thickness and thus the axial stiffness is maximal .",
    "the total material volume , deformation energy and the smallest possible cross sectional tendon area @xmath83 are shown in figure  [ pic : figure_14 ] for a varying membrane thickness @xmath78 . without using tendons",
    "the smallest possible membrane thickness is about @xmath84  mm .",
    "thinner membranes require local reinforcements through tendons .",
    "the lightest end cap does not possess any tendons and has a membrane thickness of @xmath85  mm .",
    "however , although the use of tendons increases the weight of an end cap , it reduces the required deformation energy due to the smaller membrane thickness .",
    "in general it can be said that it is advantageous to use materials for end caps with large @xmath26 ratios ratio than titan . ] . the argument for this is as follows .",
    "the membrane thickness of an end cap is proportional to    @xmath86    hence , the additional energy density of a membrane due to an unidirectional axial strain @xmath87 is    @xmath88    note that @xmath6 and thus @xmath87 are independent of the membrane thickness .",
    "hence , increasing the young s modulus increases the energy required to deform an end cap .",
    "the elastic energy required to deform an end cap by @xmath89 is shown in figure  [ pic : figure_14 ] .",
    "the corresponding change of pressure energy is subsequently derived to get a reference value .",
    "the cross sectional area @xmath90 of a pentagonal cell is    @xmath91    therefore , the change of the cross sectional area for @xmath92 is    @xmath93    so that the change of pressure energy of a one meter long cell is    @xmath94    which is significantly larger than the energy needed to deform the end caps .",
    "hence it can be concluded that the energy required to deform well designed end caps can be neglected for large cell lengths .",
    "pressure actuated cellular structures can be manufactured by using rapid prototyping .",
    "however , such an approach is relatively expensive and time consuming and thus limited to a small scale production .",
    "a remedy is to separately manufacture the main components by using manufacturing techniques such as injection molding and extrusion .",
    "pagitz et al  @xcite showed that cytoskeletons can greatly enhance the mechanical properties of pressure actuated cellular structures .",
    "furthermore , they can be used to simplify the manufacturing and assembly process as illustrated in figure  [ pic : figure_15 ] .",
    "it can be seen that end caps are manufactured together with cytoskeletons that can additionally reinforce the membrane .",
    "these cytoskeletons stick out so that they can be inserted into the cellular structure .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the forces that act on an end cap are carried by the cytoskeleton within a cell so that the gap between end cap and cellular structure is stress free and thus easy to seal .",
    "this article presented analytical expressions for optimal material properties of compliant pressure actuated cellular structures .",
    "it was shown that , for given target shapes and stiffness requirements , a cellular structure can be made from a wide range of cell sizes .",
    "furthermore it was shown that the use of small cells increases the ratio between pressure and bending energy .",
    "this might be an explanation for the relatively small cell sizes found in nastic plants .",
    "the required complexity of a numerical model for the accurate simulation of cellular structures depends on the geometry , material and cell pressures .",
    "six different numerical models were presented and their application range was studied by means of an example structure . finally , two different end cap designs for the termination of prismatic cells were investigated .",
    "it was found that it is possible to construct end caps such that the required deformation energy is relatively small if compared to the pressure energy .",
    "material properties need to be transformed for the simulation and optimization of prismatic cellular structures . particularly the young s",
