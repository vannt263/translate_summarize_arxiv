    "type - ia supernovae ( snia ) are widely thought to be the thermonuclear explosions of degenerate white dwarfs ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "their high luminosity and uniformity make snia good cosmological distance indicators @xcite , but a conclusive theoretical model of their explosion mechanism remains elusive .",
    "for instance , it is an open question on whether the progenitor consists of a single degenerate white dwarf or two ( or both ) .    we do know that snia are bright because they synthesize a sizable amount of radioactive @xmath2ni .",
    "typically , snia produce half a solar mass of radioactive nickel which decays to cobalt ( @xmath31 week time scale ) that then decays to stable @xmath2fe ( @xmath3three month time scale ) emitting energetic @xmath4-rays and positrons @xcite .",
    "early spectroscopy shows a significant amount of intermediate mass elements ( ime ) in the outer layers while late - time spectra are dominated by singly and doubly ionized iron - peak elements @xcite .",
    "snia explosions may begin with a subsonic burning front , creating a deflagration of the carbon / oxygen white dwarf , but a deflagration alone yields too little energy .",
    "alternatively , a pure detonation would create too much radioactive yield and less ime than typically observed .",
    "a  delayed detonation \" ( dd ) better matches the observations . in the dd scenario @xcite",
    ", fusion begins as a deflagration but switches to supersonic burning after some of the white dwarf has expanded , allowing carbon fusion at low density .",
    "recent work has suggested that the dense deflagration region can be offset in position and velocity from the larger , lower density detonation region @xcite .",
    "this proposition explains a number of observed snia properties near maximum and at later phases and that some diversity in snia may simply be due to random viewing angles .    at late times ,",
    "when the synthesized material becomes optically thin , the light from snia continues to be powered by radioactive decay .",
    "months to years after the explosion , the long - lived @xmath2co isotope keeps the nebula glowing by energy deposited from positrons while the @xmath4-rays escape without depositing energy .",
    "the photometric decay is expected to be exponential with a e - folding time of 111.3 days or 0.98 100 , matching that of @xmath2co decay . but @xcite found the optical decline in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands is significantly faster than @xmath2co .",
    "in contrast , @xcite showed the near - ir bands fade very slowly a year after explosion .",
    "however , @xcite also demonstrated that the bolometric luminosity , or the total flux across _ all _ bands from the optical to the ir , does decay at the expected @xmath2co energy deposition rate .",
    "sn  2011fe @xcite was the closest snia in 25 years ( @xmath7 ; @xcite ) and was extremely well studied at early epochs .",
    "it appears to have been a normal snia in terms of light curve , luminosity and spectral development . here , we present _ spitzer _ irac photometry of sn  2011fe between six months and one year after optical maximum .",
    "the brightness of sn  2011fe created a unique opportunity for detailed study of a type  ia event in the mid - ir , but it also appeared close to the earth s ecliptic pole , allowing several months of continuous spitzer visibility . to put these results into context",
    ", we also compare _ spitzer _ observations of sn  2011fe with data for other snia .",
    "[ s : introduction ]",
    "as part of a program to study the late - time properties of snia , we requested low - impact target - of - opportunity observations of sn  2011fe with the _ spitzer _ space telescope using the infrared array camera ( hereafter irac ; @xcite ) .",
    "irac photometry was also obtained through spitzer program 80196 .",
    "the location of the supernova was first visible to spitzer at the end of january 2012 and remained visible until the following september .",
    "four visits were executed over the visibility period providing the best light curve of any snia in the mid - ir . the supernova was observed in irac channel  1 ( ch1 ) and channel  2 ( ch2 ) which have effective wavelengths of 3.6@xmath0 m and 4.5@xmath0 m respectively .",
    "our program also obtained irac photometry of sn  2008q and sn  2009ig , and we re - reduced archival irac data on sn  2005df previously presented by @xcite .",
    "these three snia were well - observed at optical wavelengths around maximum light @xcite and provide good comparisons to sn  2011fe .",
    "we downloaded post - bcd images through the spitzer heritage archive .",
    "each snia was identified in the irac images by its celestial coordinates .",
    "aperture photometry was performed after the pixel values were converted to @xmath0jy . for sn  2011fe",
    ", we used the recommend 5-pixel aperture radius with annular sky radii of 12 to 20 pixels .",
    "pre - explosion _",
    "observations of host galaxy m101 conducted in 2004 provided background estimates for both channels . the position of sn  2009ig in host galaxy ngc  1015 warranted a smaller 3-pixel aperture radius , while sky backgrounds were calculated via averaging the brightness fluctuations of multiple random apertures over areas without obvious point sources .",
    "the same was done for sn  2008q in host galaxy ngc  524 and sn  2005df in ngc  1559 .",
    "aperture corrections were taken from the irac instrument handbook and the results are presented in table  [ t : photometry ] .",
    "spectra of sn  2011fe were obtained with the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) and multi - object dual spectrograph ( mods ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on several epochs during its decline @xcite .",
    "three of the spectra , 2012 march 24 , april 27 and june 12 ( ut ) were obtained over the span of the spitzer observations and we use these to estimate the decay rates of sn  2011fe at optical / near ir wavelengths . the epochs correspond to ages after @xmath5-band peak light of 196 , 230 and 276 days respectively .",
    "the spectra were obtained through a 1.0 arcsecond wide slit that was oriented to the parallactic angle for the march observation , taken at an airmass of 1.15 .",
    "the april and june observations were obtained at airmasses less than 1.1 so that differential slit losses were minimized .",
    "the spectra were wavelength - calibrated using neon and argon emission line lamps taken during the june run .",
    "the wavelength solution was then shifted based on the sky line centroids .",
    "the mods spectrograph is very stable and the wavelength shifts applied were less than 2   .",
    "mods flux sensitivity is also very stable , so no flux calibration was applied .",
    "instead , we directly compared extracted electron count rates ( proportional to the ` analog - to - digital units ' ) to avoid further uncertainties caused by flux calibrations using different standard stars under varying conditions . to test the stability of the sensitivity , we divided mods spectra of the standard star hz  44 obtained in april and june and found the fluxes differed by less than 5%  over the spectral range between 3500    and 8500   . we therefore expect systematic uncertainty on the pixel by pixel decay rates to by less than 0.05  100 . at wavelengths shorter than 3500",
    "  and longer than 8500    the difference between the standard star spectra reached 10% , so the decay rates are not as reliable at the extreme ends of the spectra .    the mods spectra of sn  2011fe are shown in figure  [ f : lbt ] .",
    "in general , the spectra are typical of a type  ia supernova a couple hundred days after explosion . between 4000    and 5500  ",
    "there is a clump of emission dominated by forbidden lines of singly and doubly ionized iron .",
    "weaker lines from cobalt , iron and nickel are clearly seen long ward of 5500   . these are some of the highest signal - to - noise ( s /",
    "n ) spectra of a type  ia supernova at late phases ever obtained and they already been used to search for hydrogen emission from sn  2011fe @xcite .",
    "the relative count rates across the spectra are stable from epoch to epoch , but the total efficiency depends on seeing and cloud cover and these were not well controlled . to simulate a broadband filter , we multiplied the spectra with a bessell @xmath5-band filter function and integrated the result .",
    "from these values we adjusted the relative adu to match the @xmath5-band decay rate of @xmath8 100 found from the late - time photometry of @xcite .",
    "lbt spectra of sn  2011fe were also obtained on 2012 may 1 ( ut , age of 234 days ) with the lucifer infrared spectrograph .",
    "the spectra covered the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands using three grating settings .",
    "only one epoch of near - ir spectra was obtained so the decay rates at these wavelengths could not be estimated , but the velocity offsets of the two strong [ ] lines are measured .",
    "the mid - ir photometry of sn  2011fe starting at an age of five months and ending about one year after explosion is shown in figure  [ f : ir_lightcurve ] .",
    "the light curves are consistent with an exponential decay , so we fit them with a function of the form @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the observed time varying flux , @xmath13 is the age since @xmath5 maximum , @xmath14 is the flux at the fiducial time of 230  days , and @xmath15 is the @xmath16-folding time of the decay . the decay rate can also be described in magnitudes per 100  days by @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting measured decay rates for sn  2011fe are given in table  [ t : irslopes ] .",
    "the 1.48@xmath1 100  seen in ch1 is significantly steeper than the 0.78@xmath18 100   measured for ch2 .",
    "the decay observed in the two spitzer bands straddle the @xmath2co rate of 0.98 100 .",
    "the decay rate for ch1 is similar to that typically seen in @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , while ch2 has a decay even more shallow than the @xmath19 band ( @xmath20 100 ; via least - squares fit to photometry from @xcite ) .",
    "the long cadence and greater distance to the other spitzer - observed type  ia events resulted in larger uncertainty in the measured decay rates compared with the sn  2011fe data .",
    "the ch1 decay rates for sn  2008q , sn  2009ig and sn  2005df all appear slightly slower .",
    "all the supernovae are consistent in that the ch1 rate is steeper than the ch2 decline rate .",
    "we created a color index based on the flux ratio between the two irac channels , or @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the fluxes measured in @xmath0jy in ch1 and ch2 , and @xmath23 are the magnitude zero points for those passbands , listed in the irac instrument handbook .",
    "extinction differences between these filters is assumed to be negligible @xcite .",
    "because the irac decay rates are so different , the ch1-ch2 color varies rapidly in time so we have chosen a fiducial time of 230  days to estimate the color parameter .",
    "this age was chosen because the spitzer archive contains several snia observed near this age , thus reducing any errors caused by interpolation .",
    "the estimated color at 230 days shows a wide range among the supernovae in our sample . to better understand the cause of this diversity",
    ", we sought to compare the 230  day color with early - time light curve shape , namely the parameter @xmath24 @xcite is defined as the change in @xmath5 magnitude from maximum to 15 days post maximum .",
    "it is related to the peak luminosity of a sn  ia through the phillips relation . ] . for sn",
    "2009ig we use the @xmath24 measured by @xcite and for sn  2011fe we use the value from @xcite . both sn  200qdf and 2008q have excellent early light curves @xcite and we measure their @xmath24 directly . the @xmath24 values and the measured irac colors",
    "are given in table  [ t : irslopes ] .",
    "the four supernovae , 2005df , 2008q , 2009ig and 2011fe , show a wide range of early light curve decline rates , and so , a wide range of synthesized radioactive nickel masses .",
    "we plot our measured irac colors at 230 days versus @xmath24 in figure  [ f : spitzer_color_dm15 ] .",
    "there appears to be a robust correlation ( albeit with only four data points ) indicating that the ch1 to ch2 flux ratio decreases with increasing @xmath24 parameter .",
    "alternatively , we see that the ch1 flux increases relative to ch2 as the amount of synthesized radioactive nickel increases since @xmath24 correlates with nickel yield . based on this handful of supernovae , the irac color appears to be a good indicator of peak optical luminosity , although this is unlikely to be useful for cosmological measurements .",
    "the radically different late - time decay rates observed at 3.6@xmath0 m and 4.5@xmath0 m is puzzling given that total flux from the optical to near - ir appears to match the @xmath2co energy injection rate @xcite .",
    "the effect is also seen when comparing the faster decay in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands to the modest @xmath19-band decay rate between six months and a year after explosion .",
    "the fast optical decline is likely compensated by a slow near - ir decay which after a year becomes a spectacular rise in the importance of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 band fluxes .",
    "what do the fast declining wavelength bands ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , ch1 ) have in common and how are they different from the slower ( @xmath19 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ch2 ) fading bands ?",
    "as most of the snia spectrum at late - times , the irac bands are expected to be dominated by emission from iron - peak elements with a mixture of singly - ionized and doubly ionized species .",
    "@xcite predicted that spectrum covered by ch1 would show strong [ ] 3.229 @xmath0 m and [ ] 3.492 @xmath0 m .",
    "in contrast , @xcite predicts several strong [ ] should dominate the wavelength region spanned by ch2 .",
    "we propose that the difference in the observed irac decay rates is a result of doubly ionized species being the dominate light source in ch1 and singly ionized iron - peak species supplying the majority of flux in ch2 .",
    "the relative amounts of emission from singly and doubly ionized species should also vary in the shorter wavelength bands , and we note that the strong [ ] 4700  blend straddles the @xmath5 and @xmath6 band transition and contributes flux to both fast - decaying bands . in contrast , the slow - fading @xmath19 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands are predominately fed by singly ionized atoms .",
    "we predict the @xmath25-band around 2.2@xmath0 m should fade like irac ch1 since it contains a strong [ ] line at 2.218@xmath0 m .    singly and",
    "doubly ionized iron - peak elements exist in very different regions of snia nebulae . using the w7 prescription @xcite",
    ", one - dimensional snia nebular models agree that [ ]  ( and [ ] which has a similar ionization energy ) atoms dominate in the inner dense regions while doubly ionized iron occupies the outer volume ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "generally , the dense regions cool quickly and doubly ionized species recombine while cooling in low density regions is inefficient and they remain dominated by doubly ionized gas .",
    "@xcite however , notes that photoionization has a major effect on the ionization structure and it is not well modeled in the nebular spectra @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled snia nebular spectra with and without accounting for photoionization . without including photoionization in the calculation , the [ ] / [ ] ratio was too small compared with the real spectrum of sn  2000cx at one year old .",
    "when including photoionization , the model predicted too much [ ] which suggests that real supernovae are intermediate between these two extremes .",
    "it is possible that the effects of photoionization in snia nebulae decrease with time as the expansion reduces the density .",
    "this should reduce the importance of the doubly ionized species through recombination while increasing the flux of singly ionized species . as the nebula transitions away from significant photoionization",
    ", we expect the filters dominated by lines from doubly ionized species will fade more quickly than @xmath2co . meanwhile , the bands dominated by singly ionized atoms will fade more slowly than @xmath26 100  with the difference in decay rates a clue to the recombination rate .    if the ch1 decay rate is a result of both the excitation decreasing at the @xmath2co rate and the recombination rate from [ ] @xmath27 [ ] , then we can approximate it by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the @xmath16-folding times of ch1 , @xmath2co and [ ] @xmath27 [ ] recombination .",
    "assuming collisional ionization are negligible at late times and photoionization is becoming unimportant , the recombination should go approximately as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the electron number density and @xmath34 is the recombination rate coefficient .",
    "the recombination coefficient is @xmath35 @xmath36 s@xmath37 and is nearly constant for temperatures between @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xmath40k @xcite .",
    "we can solve for the electron density , @xmath41 $ ] and find @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "assuming most of the iron peak atoms are doubly ionized , the mass density corresponding to this recombination rate is then approximately @xmath44 g  @xmath43 .",
    "we can compare this recombination density to the density of the standard w7 model scaled to 250 days after explosion @xcite .",
    "the scaled w7 density ranges between 10@xmath45 g  @xmath43 in the inner regions to 10@xmath46 g  @xmath43 out at 10000  km  s@xmath37 . considering the assumptions made in the calculation ,",
    "this is surprisingly close to the density for a pure recombination process removing doubly ionized species from the nebula .",
    "the ratio of the june  12 and march  24 count rates as a function of wavelength is shown in figure  [ f : ratio ] in units of 100 .",
    "the ratio has been scaled to match the @xmath5-band decay rate discussed in section  [ s : observations ] . clearly , the decay rates vary by spectral region and by specific feature . some of the small - scale variation is due to shifts in emission centroids with time .",
    "for example , the bright blend of [ ] lines at 4700    shifts by about 10    redward over the 80  days between spectra .",
    "this is shown as a decay rate of 1.4  100  on the blue side of the feature and a 1.1  100  decay on the red side .",
    "this drift was noted by @xcite and appears typical in snia . the total flux of the feature fades by 1.41  100  which is not surprising given that we have scaled the @xmath5-band flux to 1.32  100  and the 4700    line contributed significantly to this filter .",
    "in contrast , the weak features around 6000    faded at twice the @xmath2co decay rate and show no shift in the line centroid .",
    "the 5900 and 6160    lines have been attributed to [ ] emission , but the 5900    line may also contain some na  i d flux .    as noted in figure  [",
    "f : lbt ] , the blend of bright lines around 7200    fade rather slowly compared with the [ ] and [ ] lines in the blue .",
    "the emission around 7200  is often attributed to [ ] and [ ] lines .",
    "the line at 8600    also shows a slow decay rate and it too has been identified as an [ ] feature .",
    "in general , the singly ionized species show the slow decay rates while emission from doubly ionized atoms decays significantly faster than the radioactive decay rate ( see figure  [ f : lines ] ) .",
    "this supports our interpretation of the decay rates we observed in the spitzer bands and that recombination is the likely sink for the doubly ionized species .",
    "[ ] emission is hit with a triple whammy .",
    "the overall energy available for line emission decreases at the @xmath2co radioactive decay rate .",
    "in addition , recombination of doubly ionized atoms reduces their numbers as demonstrated in the decay rate of [ ] lines . but",
    "much of the cobalt is radioactive , so its numbers are decreased at twice the radioactive decay rate plus the recombination loss rate .    the emission at 6550    has been identified as from [ ] , but it appears to fade at a slower rate the the other [ ] lines .",
    "the very strong shift in peak wavelength as the line fades suggests it is a blend with a singly ionized emission feature and that combination makes it appear to fade more slowly than the other [ ] lines .",
    "the nist atomic spectra database points to strong [ ] emission at 6446 , 6456 and 6516  , while @xcite suggests a combination of [ ] and [ ] in addition to [ ] . this feature s profile is flat - topped in the june spectrum and this makes it difficult to obtain a precise peak velocity .",
    "our supposition that emission from doubly ionized species decays at a faster rate than those from singly ionized atoms appears to be supported by the optical spectra .",
    "since irac ch1 shows a rapid decay rate , then doubly ionized species should be dominant around 3.6@xmath47 m .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggested  and  lines contribute significantly to the ch1 band .",
    "thus , the ch1@xmath48ch2 color observed in the snia might be a good indicator of the ionization ratio within a snia nebula .",
    "we can ask if the correlation between the irac color and @xmath24 seen in figure  [ f : spitzer_color_dm15 ] implies that a [ ] / [ ] ratio correlates with nickel yield .",
    "sn  2003hv possessed notably strong [ ] 4700   at late times @xcite , though the sn had a large @xmath24 of 1.6 @xcite , so probably synthesized a relatively small amount of radioactive nickel .",
    "this trend is the opposite of that implied by [ ] dominating the ch1 bandpass .",
    "@xcite argued that the very strong [ ] emission seen in sn  2003hv might be due to an unusually low nebular density and that the explosion might be peculiar .",
    "the [ ] / [ ] ratio is probably a good indicator of nebular density because the recombination rate is so sensitive to density .",
    "but it is not clear why the nebular density at a fixed age should be related to @xmath24 .",
    "if the fast decaying [ ] 3.492 @xmath0 m line dominates the ch1 bandpass with contributions from slower decaying emission such as [ ] and [ ] , then the flux would appear to decay at an intermediate rate over our spitzer observation window .",
    "such a scenario would explain figure  [ f : spitzer_color_dm15 ] because the ch1@xmath48ch2 color would correlate with the [ ] / [ ] ratio and that should be a good indicator of the radioactive nickel yield .",
    "this supposition awaits @xmath49-band spectra to identify the emission features in the ch1 bandpass .",
    "we note that the irac color could be matched in the optical using the sdss @xmath50 color index for snia at late times .",
    "the sdss-@xmath51 band encompasses fairly uncontaminated features while sdss-@xmath52 band mainly sees emission by .",
    "such a color at a fixed age should correlate with peak luminosity .",
    "@xcite suggested that asymmetry in snia explosions could be manifested in the nebular spectra .",
    "while most snia appear to show little asymmetry in the outer layers of the ejecta @xcite , @xcite showed that differences in velocity shifts between ions associated with dense , inner layers could be quite large when compared to velocity shifts of the outer layers .",
    "the theory they develop is that of a dense , inner region rich in deflagration products that is offset in position and velocity from the low - density , symmetric outer region . in this scenario ,",
    "doubly ionized iron - group lines tend to trace outer low - density regions , while their singly - ionized variants trace the dense inner regions .",
    "we measured the wavelength centroids of several major features of the lbt / mods spectra and found two distinct groups : [ ] and [ ] lines tended to be blueshifted by @xmath3400 km s@xmath37 , while [ ] and [ ] features were blueshifted between 1000 and 1500 km s@xmath37 .",
    "a list of these measured lines is given in table  [ t : lineshift ] .",
    "features made from blends of singly and doubly ionized lines ( e.g. the @xmath35000 and @xmath35250   [ ] + [ ] ) appear to show higher blueshifts , as well , suggesting that their singly - ionized components are dominant .",
    "the highly blended @xmath36550 feature proved difficult to model in this manner ; the lack of a narrow , discernible peak meant a large error in identifying individual lines , though @xcite identified [ ] 6578   as an important component , and the nist atomic spectra database points to major [ ] contributions here , as well .",
    "synthetic spectra and improved atomic transition information is necessary to better determine the shift of individual lines .    despite the problems of line blending in the optical , it is clear that the velocity shifts of the [ ] 4700   line and the [ ] features at @xmath35900 and @xmath36200    are significantly smaller than the offsets of more than @xmath53  km@xmath54s@xmath37 observed in the singly ionized emission lines .",
    "both [ ] and [ ] emission likely originate in the the outer , symmetric regions of the nebula .",
    "the large difference in velocity between the [ ] and [ ] features places sn  2011fe firmly in the `` low - velocity gradient '' group ( see figure  [ f : vdot_vs_vneb ] ) .",
    "we confirmed this by examining the nebular velocity ( defined by @xcite as the average of the [ ] 7155   and the [ ] 7378   velocity shifts ) and the early - time  velocity gradient , which we calculated using the spectra presented by @xcite and made publicly available through the weizmann interactive supernova data repository",
    ". the observed velocity shift of the singly ionized nebular lines implies a viewing angle of roughly 70@xmath40 from the symmetry axis as defined by @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed mid - ir photometry and optical spectroscopy of the nearby type  ia supernova 2011fe at ages between six months to a year after the explosion .",
    "we found the following :    * the luminosity in the spitzer / irac bands are well fit by an exponential fading .",
    "the observed decay rate was 1.48@xmath1 100  in the 3.6  @xmath0 m band and 0.78@xmath1 100at 4.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "the fading rate in the ch1 filter is similar to that seen for many snia in the optical @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters .",
    "the ch2 decline rate is slower than the @xmath2co radioactive decay rate .",
    "* using sn  2011fe and three other snia observed by sptizer , we found that the ratio of the flux at 3.6  @xmath0 m to the flux at 4.5  @xmath0 m at an age of 230 days correlates with the light curve decline rate at maximum brightness . since the light curve shape at maximum",
    "is also correlated with the peak luminosity , we expect the ch1@xmath48ch2 color index at a fixed age is a good indicator of the radioactive nickel yield of a snia . * the series of optical spectra obtained with the lbt show emission features fading at three different rates depending on the element and ionization state .",
    "singly ionized iron - peak elements faded close to the @xmath2co radioactive decay rate .",
    "doubly ionized iron lines decayed at a rate similar the @xmath5-band fading . finally , doubly ionized cobalt faded at more than twice the @xmath2co radioactive decay rate . * the optical and near - ir spectra of sn  2011fe",
    "show large ( @xmath55 km@xmath54s@xmath37 ) velocity shifts in the singly ionized emission lines while doubly ionized lines showed significantly smaller offsets .",
    "it has long been known that the decline in radioactive energy input is the cause of the fading luminosity in the nebular phase . here",
    ", we show that the doubly ionized species fade more quickly than the radioactive energy input and suggest that this additional fading is due to recombination .",
    "additionally , doubly ionized cobalt sees a decline in excitation , recombination losses and direct radioactive decay to iron and so it fades at the fastest rate of all the emission lines .",
    "the decay rate variation with element and ionization state demonstrated in the lbt spectra nicely explains the range of observed decay rates seen in broadband filters during late - time studies of snia @xcite .",
    "our mid - ir spitzer photometry is consistent with the slow fading of singly ionized iron in the ch2 band and doubly ionized iron or cobalt in the ch1 filter . from the correlation between the irac color index with the radioactive nickel yield",
    ", we argue that is probably the primary source of emission around 3.6  @xmath0 m up to a year after explosion .",
    "the rapid fading of the emission will eventually lead to or becoming dominant in ch1 and a decelerating decay rate in the future .",
    "we also measured the individual line velocities of optical and nir features and confirm the pattern of velocity offsets seen by @xcite .",
    "that is , emissions from singly ionized species have higher velocity offsets than those from doubly ionized elements . according to @xcite , this is because the singly ionized species reside in the dense inner region of the nebula where an offset deflagration occurred , while the doubly ionized atoms occupy the outer , low density and more symmetric regions of the nebula .",
    "both the measures of the early and late spectra indicate sn  2011fe was a typical ` low velocity gradient ' snia viewed at an angle of about 70@xmath40 relative to the offset axis of the deflagration .",

    "<S> we also find that [ ] emission fades at more than twice the radioactive decay rate due to the combination of decreasing excitation in the nebula , recombination and cobalt decaying to iron . </S>",
