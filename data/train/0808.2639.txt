    "polarisation correlations of photons emitted in cascade emission are well known phenomenon and numerous theoretical and experimental studies exist in the literature on this subject since the early days of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "some of the earlier studies were motivated in testing generalised bell s inequalities @xcite , the existence of hidden variables and whether quantum mechanics was a non - local theory or not @xcite , following the question raised by einstein , podolsky and rosen @xcite . in recent times",
    "polarisation correlated photon pairs have become important in the field of quantum information science due to their entangled nature .",
    "moreover many applications of quantum information , such as quantum key distribution @xcite , efficient optical quantum computing @xcite , long distance quantum communication using quantum repeaters @xcite and implementation of quantum telecommunication schemes @xcite require single photon pairs per cycle .",
    "this requirement of entangled photon pairs per cycle of excitation could be satisfied by cascade emission from a single atom or atom like systems like semiconductor quantum dots , provided one gets over the inherent asymmetries .",
    "recently such cascade emission has been reported for semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "it was further seen that polarisation entanglement of the emitted photon pairs was degraded by the presence of energy level splitting of the intermediate excitonic states and any incoherent process that leads to a population transfer between the two intermediate excitonic states @xcite .",
    "moreover dephasing arising due to interaction of the quantum dot with its solid state environment can also degrade the entanglement @xcite .",
    "some recent studies have also shown how the fidelity of entanglement depends on excitonic level splitting @xcite and the dynamics of the incoherent dephasing @xcite .",
    "different methods have been proposed to reduce and control the incoherent dephasing and energy level splitting of the excitonic states thereby preserving the entanglement in the system @xcite .",
    "further , methods to enhance the generated entanglement by coupling the quantum dot to a micro - cavity have also been proposed @xcite . as quantum dot systems are of great importance for future applications in quantum information science , a clear yet simple model for understanding the effects of all these different decoherence mechanism on the dynamics of the system is required .",
    "thus we develop , in this paper , a simple theoretical model to analytically study the influence of different decoherence mechanisms and the intermediate state splitting on the generation of polarisation entangled photon pairs in cascade emission .",
    "we consider a four level system under going cascade emission as our model .",
    "we show a schematic diagram of such a cascade in figure 1 .",
    "the excited state @xmath0 and the intermediate states @xmath1 , @xmath2 would correspond to the biexcitonic and optically active excitonic states respectively in a quantum dot .",
    "further @xmath3 is taken to be the ground state . here",
    "@xmath4 is the total spontaneous emission rate of the state @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the spontaneous emission rates of the states @xmath7 and @xmath2 respectively and @xmath8(@xmath9 ) is the incoherent dephasing rate of the state @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the energy level splitting of the intermediate state is given by @xmath10 .",
    "in this type of four - level cascade scheme there are two decay paths for the excited state , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the generation of entanglement in these scheme is attributed to the fact that this decay paths can become indistinguishable .",
    "the eigenbasis of this system is formed by the four states ( @xmath13 ) . in this basis",
    "the radiative transition from the excited state generates collinearly polarised photons with linear polarisations along two orthogonal directions denoted by h ( horizontal ) and v ( vertical ) .",
    "when the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 are degenerate , the decay paths become indistinguishable and we get a maximally entangled two photon state @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the two time polarisation angle dependent intensity - intensity correlation @xmath16 .",
    "further @xmath17 is the positive ( negative ) frequency part of the quantized electric field operator at a point @xmath18 in the far - field zone and @xmath19 is the polarisation unit vector of the measured radiation at the detector along any arbitrary direction given by @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath19 s are related to the linear polarisation unit vectors @xmath21 ( where h stands for horizontal and v for vertical ) by , @xmath22 = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\cos\\theta & e^{-i\\phi}\\sin\\theta \\\\ -e^{i\\phi}\\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{array}\\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{c}\\hat{\\epsilon}_{h } \\\\",
    "\\hat{\\epsilon}_{v}\\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] and these satisfy the relation @xmath23 .",
    "the above relation can be understood as an unitary transformation between a basis defined by the linear polarisation unit vectors and a basis defined by @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in experimental setup the angles @xmath26 would correspond to the orientation of the optic axis of a half / quarter wave plate to the direction of propagation of the emitted radiation .",
    "let us now consider for simplicity that both the levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 in figure . 1 have the same incoherent dephasing rates i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "further we assume that the spontaneous decay rates of the intermediate levels are also equal .",
    "such assumptions are well justified as they do not influence the dynamics of the system significantly and yet leads to a simplified form of the second order correlation , thereby providing a better understanding of the problem . under the above assumptions and for @xmath28 the form of the two - time polarisation angle dependent intensity - intensity correlation is found to be , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the above simple form of the second order correlation has been derived to match our theoretical analysis to that of the experiment results @xcite . for details of the mathematical analysis leading to the generalised form of the two time intensity - intensity correlation the reader",
    "is referred to section 4 of this paper .",
    "one can clearly see from equation ( [ 34 ] ) that the second order correlation is profoundly influenced by both the incoherent dephasing rates as well as the energy level splitting of the intermediate states .",
    "note further , that in the presence of small @xmath10 this becomes equivalent to the second order correlations measured in ref.@xcite .",
    "next we define a quantity the degree of correlation @xmath32 as , @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for mutually orthogonal polarisation basis .",
    "the degree of correlation varies between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath35 represent perfect correlation ( @xmath36 for anti - correlation ) and 0 represent no polarisation correlation .",
    "in figure . 3(a ) we show how the time averaged degree of correlation varies with the basis angle for different values of splitting @xmath10 , of the excitonic levels .",
    "note that here the excitonic level dephasing @xmath37 has been taken to be zero .",
    "we see that the degree of correlation is independent of the polarisation basis when @xmath38 and takes a value @xmath39 .",
    "this correspond to perfect polarisation correlation among the emitted photons . from the expression of @xmath32 it is clear that this can happen only when the cross - polarised correlations vanishes and the emitted photons are perfectly co - polarised .",
    "one can even see this explicitly from equation ( [ 34 ] ) by putting the values of @xmath40 for h - v , d - d@xmath41 and v - h basis . where h , v , d and d@xmath41 stands for horizontal , vertical , diagonal and orthodiagonal polarisation basis respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for large dephasing rates the emitted photon pairs become almost un - correlated in their polarisation .",
    "this is attributed to the presence of significant cross - polarised correlation for large dephasing rates of the intermediate states .",
    "the incoherent dephasing of the intermediate levels causes a incoherent population transfer among the states @xmath1 and @xmath2 thereby allowing the second photon to be emitted with orthogonal polarisation to the first one . in the diagonal basis on the other hand",
    "the dephasing does not affect the correlation at all for large @xmath10 but significantly decreases the correlation when @xmath38 for large dephasing rates .",
    "so we see that in diagonal basis even when the intermediate levels are degenerate we can still have significant cross - correlation if there is some incoherent relaxation process by which they can get coupled .",
    "this in turn spoils the quantum correlation in the system as can be seen clearly from figure .",
    "4(b ) . in figure .",
    "5 we show how the correlations behave in the circular basis in presence of large dephasing rate ( @xmath42 ) for both non - degenerate and degenerate intermediate states .",
    "we find that in the circular basis decoherence arising due to the incoherent dephasing does not affect the degree of correlation of the emitted photons when @xmath10 is large .",
    "further we find that for degenerate intermediate levels , even though the degree of correlation @xmath43 for zero time delay , it vanishes at all later time in presence of the large dephasing .",
    "thus the decoherence makes the perfectly anti - correlated photons completely uncorrelated . the incoherent relaxation process discussed by us here",
    "are practically present in the biexcitonic - excitonic cascade in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "thus we have shown by a simple model how the decoherence arising due to such incoherent processes would strongly affect the quantum correlations .",
    "our model consist of a biexcitonic state and two excitonic states labelled as @xmath0 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the equilibrium state is labelled as @xmath3 .",
    "the biexcitonic state decays by emission of either a horizontally(h ) polarised photon @xmath45 or a vertically(v ) polarised photon @xmath46@xcite .",
    "the excitonic state @xmath47 decays to the equilibrium state @xmath3 by emission of a h(v)- polarised photon .",
    "the two excitonic states have a energy difference of @xmath48 .",
    "note that the splitting of the excitonic state in quantum dots arises due to anisotropic electron - hole exchange interactions @xcite .",
    "figure ( 1 ) show a schematic diagram of our model .",
    "the eigenbasis of this system is formed by the four states ( @xmath49 ) . in this basis",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath50 is given by , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy of the four levels ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "note that this kind of energy level scheme has been extensively used to study the cascade emission in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous emission and dephasing effects in the system are incorporated via a master equation technique @xcite under the born , markov and rotating wave approximations and is given by , @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the total spontaneous emission rate of the biexcitonic state @xmath0 , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath8(@xmath9 ) are the spontaneous emission rate and incoherent dephasing rate of the excitonic state @xmath7(@xmath2 ) ( see fig .",
    "such incoherent dephasing arises in quantum dots due to it s interaction with the solid - state environment ( in form of spin flip processes or phonon scattering ) @xcite .",
    "the curly bracket @xmath56 stands for the anti - commutator and @xmath57(@xmath58 ) is the atomic lowering ( raising ) operator which follow the simple angular momentum commutation relations . to study the dynamical evolution of this four - level cascade system",
    "we solve for the time evolution of the density operator which is given by , @xmath59 + \\mathcal{l}\\rho , \\\\ ] ] we will set the energy of the state @xmath3 equal to zero henceforth . on substituting equations ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 3a ] ) in ( [ 2 ] ) and solving for the population terms we get , @xmath60 here r signifies a constant feeding of population into the state @xmath0 from some arbitrary state @xmath61 . note that in our model we are only concerned with the dynamics of the cascade decay once the upper level is populated , and thereby do not consider explicitly the pumping of the biexciton state @xmath0 .",
    "further the excitonic level splitting @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the time dependent coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 are given by , + @xmath68 the effect of non - degenaracy of the excitonic states and their incoherent dephasing on the dynamical evolution of the system shows up if one studies the two - time nonclassical second order correlation defined in equation ( [ 29 ] ) . for our four level system the explicit form of the positive frequency part of the electric field operator",

    "in conclusion we have developed a simple theory to understand how the dephasing and energy level splitting of the excitonic states can affect polarisation entanglement of photons emitted in a biexciton - exciton cascade . we have also shown how these effects are important in determining whether the emitted photon pairs are classically correlated or entangled in different polarisation basis .",
    "further we have shown that our theoretical calculation is in agreement with the experimental results found in context to such cascade emissions in quantum dots . as a future prospect",
