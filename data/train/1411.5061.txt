    "i.e. , for each integer @xmath13 with @xmath14 the representations of euler class @xmath13 exist and form a connected component of @xmath15 the lie group @xmath5 acts on @xmath6 by conjugation , and the quotient space @xmath16 is the character space of @xmath17 since the euler classes are preserved by conjugation , the connected components of @xmath18 are also indexed by the euler classes , i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the space of conjugacy classes of representations of euler class @xmath13 . by the results of goldman@xcite , the extremal components @xmath21 are respectively identified with the teichmller space of @xmath3 and that of @xmath3 endowed with the opposite orientation .",
    "the mapping class group @xmath22 of @xmath3 is the group of isotopy classes of orientation preserving self - diffeomorphisms of @xmath17 by the dehn - nielsen theorem , @xmath22 is naturally isomorphic to the group of positive outer - automorphisms @xmath23 which acts on @xmath18 preserving the euler classes .",
    "therefore , @xmath22 acts on each connected component of @xmath24 it is well known ( see e.g. fricke@xcite ) that the @xmath22-action is properly discontinuous on the extremal components @xmath25 i.e. , the teichmller spaces , and the quotients are the riemann moduli spaces of complex structures on @xmath17 on the non - extremal components @xmath26 @xmath27 goldman conjectured in @xcite that the @xmath22-action is ergodic with respect to the measure induced by the goldman symplectic form @xcite .",
    "closely related to goldman s conjecture is a question of bowditch@xcite , question c , that whether for each non - elementary and non - extremal ( i.e. non - fuchsian ) representation @xmath1 in @xmath28 there exists a simple closed curve @xmath29 on @xmath3 such that @xmath30)$ ] is an elliptic or a parabolic element of @xmath31 recall that a representation is non - elementary if its image is zariski - dense in @xmath31 recently , march - wolff@xcite show that an affirmative answer to bowditch s question implies that goldman s conjecture is true .",

    "+ bowditch s question was originally asked for the type - preserving representations of punctured surface groups .",
    "recall that a punctured surface @xmath44 of genus @xmath45 with @xmath46 punctures is a closed surface @xmath3 with @xmath46 points removed . through out this paper , we required that the euler characteristic of @xmath44 is negative .",
    "a _ peripheral element _ of @xmath47 is an element that is represented by a curve freely homotopic to a circle that goes around a single puncture of @xmath48 a representation @xmath49 is called _ type - preserving _ if it sends every peripheral element of @xmath47 to a parabolic element of @xmath31 in @xcite , question c asks whether it is true that if a non - elementary type - preserving representation of a punctured surface group sends every non - peripheral simple closed curve to a hyperbolic element , then @xmath1 must be fuchsian .",
    "the main result of this paper gives counterexamples to this question . to state the result , we recall that there is the notion of relative euler class @xmath9 of a type - preserving representation @xmath1 that satisfies the milnor - wood inequality @xmath50 and equality holds if and only if @xmath1 is fuchsian ( see @xcite and also proposition [ mf ] ) .    [ main1 ] there are uncountably many non - elementary type - preserving representations @xmath51 with relative euler class @xmath52 that send every non - peripheral simple closed curve to a hyperbolic element . in particular",
    ", these representations are not fuchsian .",
    "our method is to use penner s lengths coordinates for the decorated character space defined by kashaev in @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , decorated character space of a punctured surface is the space of conjugacy classes of _ decorated representations _ , namely , non - elementary type - preserving representations together with an assignment of _ horocycles _ to the punctures .",
    "the lengths coordinate of a decorated representation depend on a choice of an ideal triangulation of the surface , and consists of the _ @xmath53-lengths _ of the edges determined by the horocycles , and of the _ signs _ of the ideal triangles determined by the representation .",
    "the decorated teichmller space is a connected component of the decorated character space , and the restriction of the lengths coordinates to this component coincide with penner s lengths coordinates .",
    "( see @xcite or section [ sec:2 ] for more details . ) a key ingredient in the proof is formula ( [ trace ] ) of the traces of closed curves in the lengths coordinates , found in @xcite by sun and the author . with a careful choice of an ideal triangulation of the four - punctured sphere , called a _",
    "tetrahedral triangulation _",
    ", we show that the traces of three _ distinguished simple closed curves _ are greater than @xmath34 in the absolute value if and only if the @xmath53-lengths of edges in this triangulation satisfy certain anti - triangular inequalities .",
    "we then show that each simple closed curve is distinguished in some tetrahedral triangulation , and all tetrahedral triangulations are related by a sequence of moves , called the _ simultaneous diagonal switches_. by the change of @xmath53-lengths formula ( proposition [ change ] ) , we show that the anti - triangular inequalities are preserved by the simultaneous diagonal switches .",
    "therefore , if the three distinguished simple closed curves are hyperbolic , then all the simple closed curves are hyperbolic .",
    "finally , we show that there are uncountably many choices of the @xmath53-lengths that satisfy the anti - triangular inequalities .",
    "a consequence of formula ( [ trace ] ) is theorem [ dominance ] that each non - fuchsian type - preserving representation is dominated by a fuchsian one , in the sense that the traces of the simple closed curves of the former representation are less than or equal to those of the later in the absolute value .",
    "this is a counterpart of the result of gueritaud - kassel - wolff@xcite and deroin - tholozan@xcite , where they consider dominance of closed surface group representations .    using the same technique",
    ", we also give an affirmative answer to bowditch s question for the relative euler class @xmath40 type - preserving representations of the four - punctured sphere group .",
    "[ main2 ] every non - elementary type - preserving representation @xmath51 with relative euler class @xmath54 sends some non - peripheral simple closed curve to an elliptic or parabolic element .",
    "in contrast with the connected components of the character space of a closed surface , those of a punctured surface are more subtle to describe . for @xmath44 with @xmath55 denote by @xmath56 be the space of conjugacy classes of type - preserving representations with relative euler class @xmath57 as explained in @xcite , @xmath56 can be either empty or non - connected .",
    "for example , @xmath58 the non - connectedness of @xmath56 comes from the existence of two distinct conjugacy classes of parabolic elements of @xmath31 more precisely , each parabolic element of @xmath5 is up to @xmath59 conjugate to an upper triangular matrix with trace @xmath60 and its conjugacy class is distinguished by whether the sign of the non - zero off diagonal element is positive or negative .",
    "therefore , two type - preserving representations of the same relative euler class which respectively send the same peripheral element into different conjugacy classes of parabolic elements can not be in the same connected components . throughout this paper ,",
    "we respectively call the two conjugacy class of parabolic elements the _ positive _ and the _ negative _ conjugacy classes . for a type - preserving representation @xmath61",
    "we say that the _ sign _ of a puncture @xmath62 is _ positive _ , denoted by @xmath63 if @xmath1 sends a peripheral element around this puncture into the positive conjugacy class of parabolic elements , and is _ negative _ , denoted by @xmath64 if otherwise .",
    "for an @xmath65 we denote by @xmath66 the space of conjugacy classes of type - preserving representations with relative euler class @xmath13 and signs of the punctures @xmath67 it is conjectured in @xcite that each @xmath68 if non - empty , is connected .",
    "the result confirms this for the four - punctured sphere .",

    "@xmath76 is non - empty if and only if @xmath71 contains at most one @xmath73 and 4 .",
    "all the non - empty spaces above are connected .    as a consequence of theorem [ main3 ] , @xmath77 has six connected components and each of @xmath78 has five connected components .",
    "the main tool we use in the proof is still the lengths coordinates ; and we hope that the technique could be used for the other punctured surfaces . the mapping class group @xmath79 of a punctured surface @xmath44 is the group of relative isotopy classes of orientation preserving self - diffeomorphisms of @xmath44 that fix the punctures . by the dehn - nielsen theorem ,",
    "@xmath79 is isomorphic to the group of positive outer - automorphisms @xmath80 that preserve the cyclic subgroups of @xmath47 generated by the peripheral elements , and hence acts on @xmath81 preserving the relative euler classes and the signs of the punctures .",
    "therefore , for any integer @xmath13 with @xmath82 and for any @xmath83 @xmath79 acts on @xmath84 for the four - punctured sphere , we have    [ main4 ] the @xmath85-action on each non - extremal connected component of @xmath86 is ergodic .    by march - wolff@xcite , it is not surprising that the @xmath85-action is ergodic on the connected components of @xmath86 where bowditch s question has an affirmative answer .",
    "a new and unexpected phenomenon theorem [ main4 ] reveals here is that , for punctured surfaces , the action of the mapping class group can still be ergodic when the answer to bowditch s question is negative .",
