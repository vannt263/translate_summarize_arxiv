    "cavity optomechanics is an exciting , novel experimental platform that will allow us to explore fundamental questions of quantum mechanics and paves the way for applications in quantum - information processing , high - precision metrology , and gravitational - wave detection @xcite .",
    "it was recognized early on that cavity optomechanical systems can squeeze light similar to a nonlinear kerr medium @xcite . experimentally , this ponderomotive squeezing has recently been demonstrated as well @xcite . as far as correlations between photons",
    "is concerned , photon antibunching has been predicted @xcite to occur in the single - photon strong - coupling regime @xcite and two - mode optomechanical systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , two - time photon correlation functions have been proposed as a means to observe the onset of parametric instability @xcite and unconventional photon blockade @xcite .",
    "so far , most research in the field of optomechanics has focused on dispersive coupling , where mechanical motion modulates the resonance frequency of the cavity .",
    "et al_.  @xcite have proposed a novel kind of optomechanics , where mechanical motion modulates the linewidth of the cavity . in this case",
    ", the radiation pressure force spectrum features a fano resonance modifying the interaction between light and mechanics dramatically .",
    "cooling of the mechanical oscillator with dissipative coupling has been predicted @xcite and recently also been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "however , to date most of the properties of dissipative optomechanics remain unexplored . in particular , the experimental progress in this direction",
    "motivates us to investigate the photonic properties of this setup .    in this work ,",
    "we study theoretically the potential of dissipative optomechanics as a source for squeezed light and correlated photons .",
    "our analysis reveals that the system can generate strong squeezing of light and we predict oscillations of the photon correlation function with a suppression below shot noise at finite times .",
    "it turns out that both the squeezing spectrum and the photon correlation function can be understood in terms of the normal modes of the linearized system .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the hamiltonian of an optomechanical system with dispersive as well as dissipative coupling and derive the linearized equations of motion describing this system . in sec .  [ squeezing ] we present our results on the squeezing spectrum and in sec .",

    "we study an optomechanical system in which a mechanical degree of freedom modulates the resonance frequency @xmath1 ( dispersive coupling ) and the linewidth @xmath2 ( dissipative coupling ) of a cavity mode .",

    "the non - zero expectation values hence are @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the mechanical input , and @xmath24 for the optical input .    writing @xmath25 with @xmath26 real , we decompose the optical field into mean amplitude @xmath26 and fluctuations @xmath27 and move to a frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath28 .",

    "the two normal modes are degenerate leading to a single dip in the squeezing spectrum . at larger coupling the degeneracy",
    "is broken and as normal - mode splitting ( nms ) develops two dips emerge in the squeezing spectrum @xmath58 .",

    "[ spectrafig ] ( f ) , where there is only weak squeezing in the resolved sideband limit @xmath78 , and a broad dip in the squeezing spectrum occurs in the bad - cavity limit @xmath79 .",
    "we note that since ground - state cooling for dispersive coupling is possible only in the resolved - sideband limit , a dissipative oms offers the advantage that strong squeezing and ground - state cooling can be realized simultaneously .",
