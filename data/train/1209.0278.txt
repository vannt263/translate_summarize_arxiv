    "availability of radioactive beam facilities has stimulated theoretical and experimental interest in the structure of nuclei far from the stability line .",
    "nuclear fusion reactions near the coulomb barrier are strongly affected by the structure of the interacting nuclei , especially with weakly bound neutrons  @xcite .",
    "some theoretical calculations predict that the fusion cross section is enhanced over well - bound nuclei because of the larger spatial extent of halo nucleons  @xcite . on the other hand halo nuclei can easily break up in the field of the other nucleus , due to their low binding energies , before the two nuclei come close enough to fuse and carry away available energy . early calculations of hussein _ et al . _",
    "@xcite indicate that the actual fusion cross section decreases significantly at all energies .",
    "however recent couple channel calculations of hagino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have concluded that the fusion cross section increases below the coulomb barrier because of the neutron halo whereas it decreases above the barrier because of weak coupling of the halo nucleons .",
    "experimentally this is still a hot debate because of experimental difficulties .",
    "another interest we propose here is the influence of the cluster structure in the fusion mechanism .",
    "the cluster structures of light nuclei have been studied theoretically from stable to those far away from the stability line .",
    "recent calculations , using an antisymmetrized molecular dynamics model(amd ) , indicate that light nuclei exhibit variety of distinct cluster structures  @xcite .",
    "the cluster structures are predicted even for nuclei with @xmath6 of li and be  @xcite ( where z and n are the charge and neutron number in a nucleus , respectively ) .",
    "when nuclei with a well - developed cluster structure are involved in fusion reactions near the barrier , it will be reflected on the fusion cross section , especially in the variety of the exit channel distribution or in the fusion residue distribution .",
    "the cluster structure effect may be enhanced in the fusion reaction between light systems . in these systems",
    "the coulomb interaction becomes small and the proximity effect between the two nuclei will be enhanced and therefore the structure of the projectile and/or target may reflect the fusion cross section directly , especially as an enhancement of particular incomplete fusion channels . in this paper",
    "we present the calculated results in the study of the fusion reactions of the @xmath7 system near the coulomb barrier using amd simulations .",

    "the binding energy and root mean square radius of these initial nuclei are compared to the experimental values in table 1 .",

    "the latter two cases are mainly observed at larger impact parameters . in each incident energy , a few thousand to ten thousand events are generated , depending on the fusion cross section , proportional to the impact parameter in the given range .",
    "the amd calculations were performed up to times ranging from 3000 fm / c at lower energies to 1000 fm / c at higher energy side and clusterized at the end of the calculation , using a coalescence technique in phase space .",
