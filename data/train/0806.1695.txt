    "one of the main motivations to study high energy heavy ion collisions is the creation of a new deconfined phase of strongly interacting matter , the so called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    "many experimental observations like , e.g. , jet quenching and high elliptic flow hint to the fact that a strongly coupled qgp ( sqgp ) might have been created @xcite . at cern - sps energies evidence for the creation of a new state of matter",
    "has been published , e.g. , the enhanced k/@xmath0 ratio ( horn ) and the step in the mean transverse mass excitation function for pions , kaons and protons @xcite . especially the low energy ( high @xmath1 ) program at sps showed a culmination of exciting results",
    ". therefore this energy regime will be the subject to further detailed studies at the cern - sps , bnl - rhic , jinr - nica and at the fair facility .",
    "since the direct detection of free quarks and gluons is impossible due to the confining nature of qcd , it is important to model the dynamical evolution of heavy ion reactions to draw conclusions from the final state particle distributions about the interesting early stage of the reaction .",
    "one approach which aims at the description of heavy ion reactions consistently from the initial state to the final state is relativistic transport theory @xcite .",
    "this microscopic description has been applied quite successfully to the partonic as well as to the hadronic stage of the collision .",
    "unfortunately , most transport approaches are restricted to @xmath2 scattering processes .",
    "thus , if the particle density increases it becomes questionable if a restriction to two - particle interaction is still justified .",
    "while first attempts to include multi - particle interactions have been proposed @xcite , this extension of transport theory is still in its infancy .",
    "to explain hadronization and the phase transition between the hadronic and the partonic phase on a microscopic level is also one of the main open issues that still has to be resolved .",
    "it is therefore difficult to find an appropriate prescription of the phase transition in such a microscopic approach .",
    "first , however promising attempts to solve the microscopic hadronization problem can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics , on the other hand , has been proposed many years ago as a tool for the description of the hot and dense stage of heavy ion reactions where the matter might behave like a locally thermalized ideal fluid @xcite . in this approach",
    "it is possible to model phase transitions explicitly because one of the major inputs to a hydrodynamic calculation is the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic description has gained importance over the last few years because the high elliptic flow values that have been observed at rhic seem compatible with some ideal hydrodynamic predictions @xcite . the initial conditions and freeze - out prescription are the boundary conditions for a hydrodynamic calculation and therefore a further crucial input .",
    "thus , the hydrodynamic results depend strongly on the initial and final state prescription that is applied in the specific calculation .    to get a more consistent picture of the whole dynamics of heavy ion reactions various so called microscopic plus macroscopic ( micro+macro ) hybrid approaches",
    "have been launched during the last decade .",
    "most noteworthy in this respect are the pioneering studies related to a coupling between urqmd ( ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ) and hydrodynamics ( a detailed systematic investigation of this coupling procedure can be found in the following references @xcite ) .",
    "other approaches in the same spirit are , e.g. , the nexspherio approach that uses initial conditions calculated in a non - equilibrium model ( nexus ) followed by an ideal hydrodynamic evolution @xcite or a hybrid approach by toneev et al . which uses qgsm initial conditions followed by a three - dimensional hydrodynamic evolution @xcite .",
    "in this way event - by - event fluctuations are taken into account and the calculation mimics more realistically the experimental case . for",
    "the freeze - out nexspherio employs a continuous emission scenario or a standard cooper - frye calculation .",
    "other groups , e.g. , teaney et al .",
    "@xcite , hirano et al .",
    "@xcite , bass / nonaka @xcite , are using smooth glauber or color glass condensate initial conditions followed by a full two- or three - dimensional hydrodynamic evolution and calculate the freeze - out by a subsequent hadronic cascade .",
    "the separation of chemical and kinetic freeze - out and final state interactions like resonance decays and rescatterings are taken into account .",
    "there are two major conclusions from these previous studies : the treatment of the initial state fluctuations and the final decoupling is of major importance for a sound interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , all presently existing micro+macro approaches rely on a complete separation of the three main ingredients ( initial conditions , hydrodynamic evolution , transport calculation ) .",
    "thus , it is impossible to compare the evolution of the system between hydrodynamics and transport simulation directly and from the same initial conditions . this may provide essential new insights into the role of viscosity and local equilibration .",
    "in addition , the usual separation of the program code does not allow for a dynamical coupling between hydrodynamics and transport calculation , which would be desirable to consistently solve the freeze - out puzzle @xcite .",
    "to overcome these restrictions , we go forward and build a transport approach with an embedded three - dimensional ideal relativistic one fluid evolution for the hot and dense stage of the reaction .",
    "this allows to reduce the parameters for the initial conditions and the freeze - out prescription .",
    "the aim is to compare calculations with different eos within the same framework .",
    "it will be possible to extract the effect of changes in the eos , e.g. , a phase transition from hadronic matter to the qgp , on observables .    in this paper",
    "we describe the specific micro+macro hybrid approach that embeds a hydrodynamic phase in the urqmd approach .",
    "first we explain the initial conditions , then introduce the basics of the hydrodynamic evolution including the hadron gas eos and the transport calculation and illustrate how the freeze - out is treated . in the second part",
    ", the sensitivity of the results on the parameters are tested and the time evolution of the baryon density and the particle numbers are compared .",
    "results on particle multiplicities and rapidity as well as transverse mass spectra are presented in the third part .    at present",
    "we have calculated results imposing a hadron gas eos to provide a baseline calculation to disentangle the effects of the different assumptions for the underlying dynamics in a transport vs. hydrodynamic calculation .",
    "the purely hadronic calculations can be compared in the broad energy regime from @xmath3gev where a vast amount of experimental data from bnl - ags and cern - sps exists and which will be explored in more detailed energy scans by the fair project near gsi and the critrhic program .",
    "studies employing different eos are delayed to future work to concentrate on effects of the underlying dynamics first .",
    "the modelling of the dynamical evolution of heavy ion reactions is essential to gain further insights about the properties of the newly produced hot and dense qcd matter .",
    "transport theory aims at the description of all stages of the collision on the basis of an effective solution of the relativistic boltzmann equation @xcite    @xmath4    this equation describes the time evolution of the distribution functions for particle species @xmath5 and includes the full collision term on the right hand side .",
    "the interaction with external potentials leads to an additional term on the left hand side .",
    "the influence of potentials gets small at higher energies compared to the energy that is transferred by collisions .",
    "therefore , they are dropped in eqn .",
    "[ boltzmann ] and are not further discussed here .",
    "usually , the collision kernel is truncated on the level of binary collisions and @xmath6 processes to keep the calculation numerically tractable .",
    "this microscopic approach has the advantage that it is applicable to non - equilibrium situations and the full phase space information is available at all stages of the heavy ion reaction .",
    "the restriction to binary collisions assumes large mean free paths of the particles . between interactions the particle trajectories",
    "are given by straight line trajectories and particles are assumed to be in asymptotic states between the collisions ( no `` memory effect '' ) .",
    "this assumption might not be justified in the hot and very dense stage of heavy ion collisions anymore . in this regime",
    "the continuum limit in form of relativistic hydrodynamics might fit better to the characteristics of the system .",
    "the hydrodynamic evolution is governed by the energy and momentum conservation laws for given initial conditions , i.e. spatial distributions of energy and net baryon number densities .",
    "the coordinate space is divided into small cells in which the distribution functions correspond to equilibrium distributions ( fermi or bose distribution ) . in this macroscopic approach",
    "the propagated quantities are net baryon number and energy densities which can be translated into information about the temperature and chemical potential via the specific equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "since the evolution is driven by pressure gradients and the pressure is determined via the eos , the eos is the essential ingredient for the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "thus , hydrodynamics is a good tool to describe collective behaviour .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics applies to systems with small mean free path , otherwise viscous effects have to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "a general advantage of hydrodynamics is the feature to explicitly incorporate phase transitions by changing the eos .",
    "however , in the late stage of the heavy ion reaction the system gets too dilute to apply ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "the hadronic rescatterings and decays of resonances have to be described , e.g. , by using a transport description .",
    "overall , there are two crucial points one has to take care of when building up a transport+hydrodynamics hybrid approach .",
    "the first is the initial switch from the microscopic to the macroscopic calculation where it has to be ensured that the local equilibrium assumption is fulfilled .",
    "the second one is the so called freeze - out where the hydrodynamic fields are mapped to particles that are further propagated in a hadronic cascade .",
    "the freeze - out transition must be placed in a region where both descriptions are valid at the same time , e.g . , the phase transition region . in the following the specific implementation developed here",
    "will be discussed in more detail .",
    "for our investigation , the urqmd model ( v2.3 )  @xcite is applied to heavy ion reactions from @xmath7  gev .",
    "this non - equilibrium transport approach constitutes an effective solution of the relativistic boltzmann equation ( see eqn .",
    "[ boltzmann ] ) .",
    "the underlying degrees of freedom are hadrons and strings that are excited in high energetic binary collisions .",
    "mean fields can in principle be taken into account in this framework , but the model is run in the so called cascade mode without inter - particle potentials . to omit the potentials is reasonable because the inclusion of mean fields would not change the results in the energy range that we are considering here .",
    "note that this is consistent with the calculation of the equation of state for the hydrodynamic evolution where no mean field has been taken into account as well .",
    "the projectile and target nuclei are initialised according to a woods - saxon profile in coordinate space and fermi momenta are assigned randomly for each nucleon in the rest frame of the corresponding nucleus .",
    "the hadrons are propagated on straight lines until the collision criterium is fulfilled .",
    "if the covariant relative distance @xmath8 between two particles gets smaller than a critical distance that is given by the corresponding total cross section a collision takes place ,    @xmath9    each collision process is calculated in the rest frame of the binary collision .",
    "the reference frame that is used for the time ordering of the collisions and later on also for the switchings to and from the hydrodynamic phase is the equal speed - system of the nucleus - nucleus collision ( for symmetric systems the equal speed system is identical to the center of mass system ) .    in urqmd 55 baryon and 32 meson species , ground state particles and all resonances with masses up to @xmath10 gev ,",
    "are implemented with their specific properties and interaction cross sections .",
    "in addition , full particle - antiparticle symmetry is applied .",
    "isospin symmetry is assumed and only flavour - su(3 ) states are taken into account .",
    "the elementary cross sections are calculated by detailed balance or the additive quark model or are fitted and parametrized according to the available experimental data . for resonance excitations and decays the breit - wigner formalism , utilizing their vacuum properties is employed .    towards higher energies ,",
    "the treatment of sub - hadronic degrees of freedom is of major importance . in the present model ,",
    "these degrees of freedom enter via the introduction of a formation time for hadrons produced in the fragmentation of strings @xcite .",
    "string excitation and fragmentation is treated according to the lund model . for hard collisions with large momentum transfer ( @xmath11 gev )",
    "pythia is used for the calculation . a phase transition to a quark - gluon state",
    "is not incorporated explicitly into the model dynamics . however , a detailed analysis of the model in equilibrium yields an effective equation of state of hagedorn type @xcite .",
    "the urqmd transport model is successful in describing the yields and the @xmath12 spectra of various particles in proton - proton , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "a compilation of results of the actual version urqmd-2.3 compared to experimental data can be found in @xcite .",
    "apart from the success of transport simulations to describe spectra and yields certain problems remain :    * elliptic flow values above sps energies are too small @xcite , * hbt radii hint to a very small @xmath13 ratio @xcite , * strangeness , especially multi - strange baryons are not produced in sufficient amounts @xcite .",
    "these observables that are sensitive to the early stage of the collision ( pressure ) or to the approach of thermal and chemical equilibrium during the collision history hint to the fact that a purely hadronic transport model may not be sufficient to describe the dynamics of the hot and dense stage of heavy ion reactions at higher energies @xcite .",
    "therefore , these observations exemplify the need to embed a full three - dimensional relativistic fluid dynamics description for these stages of the reaction .    for the results that are shown in this paper , the reference calculations are always performed employing the state - of - the - art urqmd-2.3 model .",
    "the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model is used to calculate the initial state of a heavy ion collision for the hydrodynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "this is necessary to account for the non - equilibrium nature of the very early stage of the collision .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of the initial state are naturally included by this set - up .",
    "the coupling between the urqmd initial state and the hydrodynamical evolution takes place when the two lorentz - contracted nuclei have passed through each other . the initial time to begin with the hydrodynamical evolution",
    "is calculated via eqn .",

    "@xmath14    where r is the radius of the nucleus , @xmath15 is the nucleon mass and @xmath16 is the kinetic beam energy .",
    "this assures that ( essentially ) all initial baryon - baryon scatterings have proceeded and that the energy deposition has taken place .",
    "this is the earliest possible transition time where thermalization might be achieved @xcite .",
    "it is also convenient from the hydrodynamical point of view since at that time the two baryon currents that fly into oppposite directions have separated again .    in general ,",
    "it is not well - established how and when chemical and kinetic equilibrium might have been reached in the early stage of the collision .",
    "one of the problems is , e.g. , that the local equilibrium assumption might not apply equally well to all parts of the system at the same time in the computational frame which corresponds to the center of mass system of the two colliding nuclei . as a consequence ,",
    "the faster particles have had less time in their local rest frame to equilibrate .",
    "for the bulk part and the high density region at midrapidity the difference between the two frames is small .",
    "these problems are present in all hydrodynamic / macroscopic approaches that rely on an equilibrium assumption and it is not our attempt to resolve these difficulties in this paper .",
    "one perspective might be the dynamical coupling between the initial transport calculation and the hydrodynamic evolution including source terms on both sides of the transition surface .    to allow for a consistent and numerically stable mapping of the point like particles from urqmd to the 3-dimensional spatial - grid with a cell size of @xmath17 , each hadron",
    "is represented by a gaussian with a finite width .",
    "`` pre - formed '' hadrons in the process of string fragmentation are also included in the transformation to the hydrodynamic quantities .",
    "i.e. each particle is described by a three - dimensional gaussian distribution of its total energy , momentum ( in x- , y- , and z - direction ) and baryon number density .",
    "the width of these gaussians is chosen to be @xmath18fm .",
    "a smaller gaussian widths leads to numerical instabilities ( e.g. , entropy production ) in the further hydrodynamical evolution , while a broader width would smear out the initial fluctuations to a large extent . to account for the lorentz - contraction of the nuclei in the longitudinal direction ,",
    "a lorentz - gamma - factor is included .",
    "the resulting distribution function in the computational frame ( cf ) , e.g. , for the energy density , reads :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 provides the proper normalisation , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energy density and total energy of the particle in the computational frame , while @xmath23 is the position vector of the particle .",
    "summing over all single particle distribution functions leads to distributions of energy , momentum and baryon number densities in each cell .    to allow for calculations at finite impact parameter the spectators - nucleons that have not interacted at all before the start time of the hydrodynamic evolution @xmath24 - are propagated separately from the hydrodynamic evolution",
    "the spectators are propagated on straight line trajectories in the usual cascade mode until the end of the hydrodynamic phase has been reached .    instead of smearing out the initial distributions by describing the point like hadrons as gaussian distributions",
    ", one could also obtain a smooth distribution by averaging over a large sample of urqmd events .",
    "our procedure of creating a new initial state for each event is motivated by the fact , that the experimental results all relate to observed ( averaged ) final , and not initial , states .",

    "the equation of state is needed as an additional input to calculate the pressure , temperature and chemical potential corresponding to the energy and the baryon number densities .",
    "since the evolution of the system is driven by pressure gradients the eos has the most important influence on the evolution .      to solve the hydrodynamical equations , the eos , the pressure as a function of energy and net - baryon number density , is needed as an input . since the actual eos of hot and dense qcd matter is still",
    "not precisely known , it may seem disadvantageous to have this additional uncertainty in the model . on the contrary it may prove to be an important trait of the model to be able to study changes on the dynamics of the bulk matter when changing the eos thus finding observables for a phase transition in hot qcd matter . for recent discussions of different eos and how to obtain eos from lattice calculations ,",

    "the mean value of the transverse mass of pions is proportional to the temperature of the system and very different in the two calculations at higher energies .",
    "the urqmd approach shows a softening of the equation of state in the region where the phase transition is expected because of non - equilibrium effects , while the hadron gas hydrodynamic calculation continuously rises as a function of the energy .",

    "[ fig_mptmass ] shows the mean transverse momenta as a function of particle mass for @xmath157 and @xmath155 particles .",
    "here we observe the behaviour known from previous hybrid studies , that with increased strangeness , baryons accumulate less flow than in a complete hydrodynamic approach .",
    "this effect can be traced back to the small cross sections of multi strange baryons in the hadronic cascade , thus showing , that the freeze - out / decoupling process proceeds gradually .",
    "we have presented the first fully integrated boltzmann+hydrodynamics approach to relativistic heavy ion reactions .",
    "this hybrid approach is based on the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) transport approach with an intermediate hydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision . the specific coupling procedure including the initial conditions and the freeze - out prescription have been explained .",
    "the event - by - event character of the hybrid approach has been emphasized .",
    "the present implementation allows to compare pure microscopic transport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same initial conditions and freeze - out procedure .",
    "the parameter dependences of the model have been investigated and the time evolution of different quantities were explored .",
    "these tests led to the conclusion that the choice of the starting time and the freeze - out criterium does generally alter the multiplicities and transverse mass spectra only on a @xmath158 level .",
    "the time evolution has shown that there are no discontinuities at the switching times in the hybrid model calculation .",
    "the importance of the final state interactions has been emphasized by demonstrating that there is still resonance regeneration after the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "the effects of the change in the underlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non - equilibrium transport theory - have been explored .",
    "the final pion and proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the isentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are enhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "the results of the different calculations for the mean transverse mass excitation function , rapidity and transverse mass spectra for different particle species at three different beam energies have been discussed in the context of the available data .",
    "the transverse expansion of the system is much faster in the hybrid model calculation , especially at higher energies which leads to differences in the observables that are sensitive to the transverse dynamics .",
    "this finding indicates qualitatively that `` new '' physical effects like , e.g. , non - equilibrium effects or a phase transition have to be taken into account .",
    "forthcoming work will be devoted to the study of different equations of state and the effect of changes in the equation of state on observables .",
    "also in progress are calculations within the hybrid model at higher beam energies ( rhic and lhc ) , but therefore specific numerical subtleties have to be resolved like , e.g. , a dynamical grid size for the hydrodynamical evolution",
