    "recent years have witnessed much interest in cognitive radio systems due to their promise as a technology that enables systems to utilize the available spectrum much more effectively .",
    "this interest has resulted in a spur of research activity in the area . in @xcite , asghari and",
    "aissa , under constraints on the average interference caused at the licensed user over rayleigh fading channels , studied two adaptation policies at the secondary user s transmitter in a cognitive radio system one of which is variable power and the other is variable rate and power .",
    "they maximized the achievable rates under the above constraints and the bit error rate ( ber ) requirement in mqam modulation .",
    "the authors in @xcite derived the fading channel capacity of a secondary user subject to both average and peak received - power constraints at the primary receiver .",
    "in addition , they obtained optimum power allocation schemes for three different capacity notions , namely , ergodic , outage , and minimum - rate .",
    "_ in @xcite studied the performance of spectrum - sensing radios under channel fading .",
    "they showed that due to uncertainty resulting from fading , local signal processing alone may not be adequate to meet the performance requirements .",
    "therefore , to remedy this uncertainty they also focused on the cooperation among secondary users and the tradeoff between local processing and cooperation in order to maximize the spectrum utilization .",
    "furthermore , the authors in @xcite focused on the problem of designing the sensing duration to maximize the achievable throughput for the secondary network under the constraint that the primary users are sufficiently protected .",
    "they formulated the sensing - throughput tradeoff problem mathematically , and use energy detection sensing scheme to prove that the formulated problem indeed has one optimal sensing time which yields the highest throughput for the secondary network .",
    "moreover , quan _",
    "_ in @xcite introduced a novel wideband spectrum sensing technique , called multiband joint detection , which jointly detects the signal energy levels over multiple frequency bands rather than considering one band at a time .    in many wireless systems",
    ", it is very important to provide reliable communications while sustaining a certain level of quality - of - service ( qos ) under time - varying channel conditions .",
    "for instance , in wireless multimedia transmissions , stringent delay qos requirements need to be satisfied in order to provide acceptable performance levels . in cognitive radio systems ,",
    "challenges in providing qos assurances increase due to the fact that secondary users should operate under constraints on the interference levels that they produce to primary users . for the secondary users , these interference constraints lead to variations in transmit power levels and channel accesses .",
    "for instance , intermittent access to the channels due to the activity of primary users make it difficult for the secondary users to satisfy their own qos limitations .",
    "these considerations have led to studies that investigate the cognitive radio performance under qos constraints .",
    "musavian and aissa in @xcite considered variable - rate , variable - power mqam modulation employed under delay qos constraints over spectrum - sharing channels . as a performance metric , they used the effective capacity to characterize the maximum throughput under qos constraints .",
    "they assumed two users sharing the spectrum with one of them having a primary access to the band .",
    "the other , known as secondary user , is constrained by interference limitations imposed by the primary user .",
    "considering two modulation schemes , continuous mqam and discrete mqam with restricted constellations , they obtained the effective capacity of the secondary user s link , and derived the optimum power allocation scheme that maximizes the effective capacity in each case .",
    "additionally , in @xcite , they proposed a qos constrained power and rate allocation scheme for spectrum sharing systems in which the secondary users are allowed to use the spectrum under an interference constraint by which a minimum - rate of transmission is guaranteed to the primary user for a certain percentage of time .",
    "moreover , applying an average interference power constraint which is required to be fulfilled by the secondary user , they obtained the maximum arrival - rate supported by a rayleigh block - fading channel subject to satisfying a given statistical delay qos constraint .",
    "we note that in these studies on the performance under qos limitations , channel sensing is not incorporated into the system model . as a result ,",
    "adaptation of the cognitive transmission according to the presence or absence of the primary users is not considered .    in @xcite , where we also concentrated on cognitive transmission under qos constraint",
    ", we assumed that the secondary transmitter sends the data at two different fixed rates and power levels , depending on the activity of the primary users , which is determined by channel sensing performed by the secondary users .",
    "we constructed a state transition model with eight states to model this cognitive transmission channel , and determined the effective capacity . on the other hand",
    ", we assumed in @xcite that channel sensing is done only in one channel , and did not impose explicit interference constraints .    in this paper , we study the effective capacity of cognitive radio channels where the cognitive radio detects the activity of primary users in a multiband environment and then performs the data transmission in one of the transmission channels .",
    "both the secondary receiver and the secondary transmitter know the fading coefficients of their own channel , and of the channel between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver .",
    "the cognitive radio has two power allocation policies depending on the activities of the primary users and the sensing decisions .",
    "more specifically , the contributions of this paper are the following :    1 .",
    "we consider a scenario in which the cognitive system employs multi - channel sensing and uses one channel for data transmission thereby decreasing the probability of interference to the primary users .",
    "we identify a state - transition model for cognitive radio transmission in which we compare the transmission rates with instantaneous channel capacities , and also incorporate the results of channel sensing .",
    "3 .   we determine the effective capacity of the cognitive channel under limitations on the average interference power experienced by the primary receiver .",
    "we identify the optimal criterion to select the transmission channel out of the available channels and obtain the optimal power adaptation policies that maximize the effective capacity .",
    "we analyze the interactions between the effective capacity , qos constraints , channel sensing duration , channel detection threshold , detection and false alarm probabilities through numerical techniques .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows : in section [ system ] , we discuss the channel model and analyze multi - channel sensing .",
    "we describe the channel state transition model in section [ subsec : state ] under the assumption that the secondary users have perfect csi and send the data at rates equal to the instantaneous channel capacity values . in section [ sec : consraint ] , we analyze the received interference power at the primary receiver and apply this as a power constraint on the secondary users . in section",
    "[ effective capacity ] , we define the effective capacity and find the optimal power distribution and show the criterion to choose the best channel .",
    "numerical results are shown in section [ numericalresults ] , and conclusions are provided in section [ conlusion ] .",
    "in this paper , we consider a cognitive radio system in which secondary users sense @xmath0 channels and choose one channel for data transmission .",
    "we assume that channel sensing and data transmission are conducted in frames of duration @xmath1 seconds . in each frame",
    ", @xmath2 seconds is allocated for channel sensing while data transmission occurs in the remaining @xmath3 seconds .",
    "transmission power and rate levels depend on the primary users activities .",
    "if all of the channels are detected as busy , transmitter selects one channel with a certain criterion , and sets the transmission power and rate to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , where @xmath6 is the index of the selected channel and @xmath7 denotes the time index . note that if @xmath8 , transmitter stops sending information when it detects primary users in all channels .",
    "if at least one channel is sensed to be idle , data transmission is performed with power @xmath9 and at rate @xmath10 .",
    "if multiple channels are detected as idle , then one idle channel is selected again considering a certain criterion .",
    "the discrete - time channel input - output relation between the secondary transmitter and receiver in the @xmath11 symbol duration in the @xmath12 channel is given by @xmath13 if the primary users are absent .",
    "on the other hand , if primary users are present in the channel , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the complex - valued channel input and output , respectively . in ( [ input - out1 ] ) and ( [ input - out2 ] ) , @xmath17 is the channel fading coefficient between the cognitive transmitter and the receiver .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 has a finite variance , i.e. , @xmath18 , but otherwise has an arbitrary distribution .",
    "we define @xmath19 .",
    "we consider a block - fading channel model and assume that the fading coefficients stay constant for a block of duration @xmath1 seconds and change from one block to another independently in each channel . in ( [ input - out2 ] ) , @xmath20 represents the active primary user s faded signal arriving at the secondary receiver in the @xmath21 channel , and has a variance @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 models the additive thermal noise at the receiver , and is a zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variable with variance @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the bandwidth of the @xmath21 channel is @xmath26 .    in the absence of detailed information on primary users transmission policies ,",
    "energy - based detection methods are favorable for channel sensing . knowing that wideband channels exhibit frequency selective features",
    ", we can divide the band into channels and estimate each received signal through its discrete fourier transform ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the channel sensing can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem between the noise @xmath23 and the signal @xmath20 in noise .",
    "noting that there are @xmath27 complex symbols in a duration of @xmath2 seconds in each channel with bandwidth @xmath28 , the hypothesis test in channel @xmath29 can mathematically be expressed as follows : @xmath30 for the above detection problem , the optimal neyman - pearson detector is given by @xcite @xmath31 we assume that @xmath20 has a circularly symmetric complex gaussian distribution with zero - mean and variance @xmath32 . assuming further that @xmath33 are i.i.d . , we can immediately conclude that the test statistic @xmath34 is chi - square distributed with @xmath35 degrees of freedom . in this case , the probabilities of false alarm and detection can be established as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the regularized lower gamma function and is defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lower incomplete gamma function and @xmath40 is the gamma function . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , the probability of detection , @xmath41 , and the probability of false alarm , @xmath42 , are plotted as a function of the energy detection threshold , @xmath43 , for different values of channel detection duration .",
    "note that the bandwidth is @xmath44khz and the block duration is @xmath45s .",
    "we can see that when the detection threshold is low , @xmath41 and @xmath42 tend to be 1 , which means that the secondary user , always assuming the existence of an active primary user , transmits with power @xmath46 and rate @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the detection threshold is high , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are close to zero , which means that the secondary user , being unable to detect the activity of the primary users , always transmits with power @xmath48 and rate @xmath49 , possibly causing significant interference .",
    "the main purpose is to keep @xmath41 as close to 1 as possible and @xmath42 as close to 0 as possible .",
    "therefore , we have to keep the detection threshold in a reasonable interval .",
    "note that the duration of detection is also important since increasing the number of channel samples used for sensing improves the quality of channel detection .    in the hypothesis testing problem in ( [ hypothesis ] ) , another approach is to consider @xmath34 as gaussian distributed , which is accurate if @xmath27 is large @xcite . in this case , the detection and false alarm probabilities can be expressed in terms of gaussian @xmath50-functions .",
    "we would like to note the rest of the analysis in the paper does not depend on the specific expressions of the false alarm and detection probabilities .",
    "however , numerical results are obtained using ( [ false alarm ] ) and ( [ eq : probdetect ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we assume that both the secondary receiver and transmitter have perfect channel side information ( csi ) , and hence perfectly know the realizations of the fading coefficients @xmath51 .",
    "we further assume that the wideband channel is divided into channels , each with bandwidth that is equal to the coherence bandwidth @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , we henceforth have @xmath53 . with this assumption",
    ", we can suppose that independent flat fading is experienced in each channel . in order to further simplify the setting",
    ", we consider a symmetric model in which fading coefficients are identically distributed in different channels .",
    "moreover , we assume that the background noise and primary users signals are also identically distributed in different channels and hence their variances @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not depend on @xmath29 , and the prior probabilities of each channel being occupied by the primary users are the same and equal to @xmath56 . in channel",
    "sensing , the same energy threshold , @xmath43 , is applied in each channel .",
    "finally , in this symmetric model , the transmission power and rate policies when the channels are idle or busy are the same for each channel . due to the consideration of a symmetric model , we in the subsequent analysis drop the subscript @xmath29 in the expressions for the sake of brevity .",
    "first , note that we have the following four possible scenarios considering the correct detections and errors in channel sensing :    _ scenario 1 : _ all channels are detected as busy , and channel used for transmission is actually busy .",
    "_ scenario 2 : _ all channels are detected as busy , and channel used for transmission is actually idle .    _",
    "scenario 3 : _ at least one channel is detected as idle , and channel used for transmission is actually busy .    _",
    "scenario 4 : _ at least one channel is detected as idle , and channel used for transmission is actually idle .    in each scenario",
    ", we have one state , namely either on or off , depending on whether or not the instantaneous transmission rate exceeds the instantaneous channel capacity . considering the interference @xmath57 caused by the primary users as additional gaussian noise , we can express the instantaneous channel capacities in the above four scenarios as follows :    [ channel capacity ]    _ scenario 1 : _ @xmath58 .    _",
    "scenario 2 : _ @xmath59 .",
    "_ scenario 3 : _ @xmath60 .",
    "_ scenario 4 : _ @xmath61 .",
    "above , we have defined @xmath62 note that @xmath63 denotes the fading power . in scenarios 1 and 2 ,",
    "the secondary transmitter detects all channels as busy and transmits the information at rate @xmath64 on the other hand , in scenarios 3 and 4 , at least one channel is sensed as idle and the transmission rate is @xmath65 since the transmitter , assuming the channel as idle , sets the power level to @xmath66 and expects that no interference from the primary transmissions will be experienced at the secondary receiver ( as seen by the absence of @xmath55 in the denominator of @xmath67 ) .    in scenarios 1 and 2 ,",
    "transmission rate is less than or equal to the instantaneous channel capacity .",
    "hence , reliable transmission at rate @xmath47 is attained and channel is in the on state .",
    "similarly , the channel is in the on state in scenario 4 in which the transmission rate is @xmath49 . on the other hand , in scenario 3",
    ", transmission rate exceeds the instantaneous channel capacity ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) due to miss - detection . in this case",
    ", reliable communication can not be established , and the channel is assumed to be in the off state .",
    "note that the effective transmission rate in this state is zero , and therefore information needs to be retransmitted .",
    "we assume that this is accomplished through a simple arq mechanism .    for this cognitive transmission model , we initially construct a state transition model .",
    "while the ensuing discussion describes this model , figure [ fig : fig2 ] provides a depiction . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , there are @xmath69 on states and 1 off state .",
    "the single off state is the one experienced in scenario 3 .",
    "the first on state , which is the top leftmost state in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , is a combined version of the on states in scenarios 1 and 2 in both of which the transmission rate is @xmath47 and the transmission power is @xmath46 .",
    "note that all the channels are detected as busy in this first on state .",
    "the remaining on states labeled @xmath70 through @xmath71 can be seen as the expansion of the on state in scenario 4 in which at least one channel is detected as idle and the channel chosen for transmission is actually idle .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath12 on state for @xmath72 is the on state in which @xmath73 channels are detected as idle and the channel chosen for transmission is idle .",
    "note that the transmission rate is @xmath49 and the transmission power is @xmath48 in all on states labeled @xmath70 through @xmath71 .",
    "next , we characterize the state transition probabilities .",
    "state transitions occur every @xmath1 seconds .",
    "we can easily see that the probability of staying in the first on state , in which all channels are detected as busy , is expressed as follows : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the probability that channel is detected as busy , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the probabilities of detection and false alarm , respectively as defined in ( [ eq : probdetect ] ) . recall that @xmath56 denotes the probability that a channel is busy ( i.e. , there are active primary users in the channel ) .",
    "it is important to note that the transition probability in ( [ eq : transitionprob ] ) is obtained under the assumptions that the primary user activity is independent among the channels and also from one block to another . indeed , under the assumption of independence over the blocks , the state transition probabilities do not depend on the originating state and hence we have @xmath76 where we have defined @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "similarly , we can obtain for @xmath79 , @xmath80 now , we can easily observe that the transition probabilities for the off state are @xmath81 then , we can easily see that the @xmath82 state transition probability matrix can be expressed as    @xmath83      =      \\left [          \\begin{array}{cccc }              p_{1 }      & . & .",

    "note also that in each frame duration of @xmath1 seconds , @xmath85 bits are transmitted and received in state 1 , and @xmath86 bits are transmitted and received in states 2 through @xmath69 , while the transmitted number of bits is assumed to be zero in state @xmath87 .",
    "in this section , we consider interference power constraints to limit the transmission powers of the secondary users and provide protection to primary users . in particular , we assume that the transmission power of the secondary users is constrained in such a way that the average interference power on the primary receiver is limited .",
    "note that interference to the primary users is caused in scenarios 1 and 3 . in scenario 1 ,",
    "the channel is busy , and the secondary user , detecting the channel as busy , transmits at power level @xmath88 .",
    "consequently , the instantaneous interference power experienced by the primary user is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the magnitude - square of the fading coefficient of the channel between the secondary transmitter and the primary user .",
    "note also that the probability of being in scenario 1 ( i.e. , the probability of detecting all channels busy and having the chosen transmission channel as actually busy ) is @xmath91 , as can be easily seen through an analysis similar to that in ( [ eq : transitionprobformula ] ) .    in scenario 3 ,",
    "the secondary user , detecting the channel as idle , transmits at power @xmath92 although the channel is actually is busy . in this case",
    ", the instantaneous interference power is @xmath93 . since we consider power adaption , transmission power levels @xmath88 and @xmath92 in general vary with @xmath94 and also with @xmath95 , which is the power of the fading coefficient between the secondary transmitter and secondary receiver in the chosen transmission channel . hence ,",
    "in both scenarios , the instantaneous interference power levels depend on both @xmath94 and @xmath95 whose distributions depend on the criterion with which the transmission channel is chosen and the number of available channels from which the selection is performed . for this reason ,",
    "it is necessary in scenario 3 to separately consider the individual cases with different number of idle - detected channels .",
    "we have @xmath0 such cases .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath21 case for @xmath96 , we have @xmath29 channels detected as idle and the channel chosen out of these @xmath29 channels is actually busy .",
    "the probability of the @xmath21 case can be easily found to be @xmath97    following the above discussion , we can now express the average interference constraints as follows : @xmath98 note from above that @xmath99 is the constraint on the interference averaged over the distributions of @xmath95 and @xmath94 ( through the expectations ) , and also averaged over the probabilities of different scenarios and cases .",
    "it is important to note that the term @xmath100 , as discussed above , depends in general on the number of idle - detected channels , @xmath29 .",
    "this dependence is indicated through the subscript @xmath29 .    in a system with more strict requirements on the interference ,",
    "the following individual interference constraints can be imposed : @xmath101 if , for instance , @xmath102 , then interference averaged over fading is limited by the same constraint regardless of which scenario is being realized . as considered in @xcite , by appropriately choosing the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 in ( [ eq : individualinterference ] ) , we can provide primary users a minimum rate guarantee for a certain percentage of the time in a rayleigh fading environment through the following outage constraints : @xmath105 @xmath106 and @xmath107 can be seen as the outage constraints in scenario 1 and in the @xmath21 case of scenario 3 , respectively . in the above formulations , @xmath108 is the required minimum transmission rate to be provided to the primary users with outage probabilities @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the fading coefficient of the channel between the primary transmitter and primary receiver .",
    "@xmath111 is the variance of the zero - mean , circularly symmetric , complex gaussian thermal noise at the primary receiver .",
    "@xmath112 is the transmission power of the primary transmitter . under the assumption that @xmath113 is an exponential random variable ( i.e.",
    ", we have a rayleigh fading channel between the primary transmitter and receiver ) , the outage probability in ( [ outage1 ] ) can be expressed as follows : @xmath114 where ( [ eq : outageconstraint2 ] ) is obtained by performing integration with respect to the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath113 in the evaluation of the probability expression in ( [ eq : outageconstraint1 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the expectation in ( [ eq : outageconstraint2 ] ) is with respect to the remaining random components @xmath88 and @xmath94 .",
    "finally , the inequality in ( [ eq : outageconstraint3 ] ) follows from the concavity of the function @xmath115 and jensen s inequality . from ( [ eq : outageconstraint3 ] ) , we can immediately see that if we impose @xmath116 then the constraint in ( [ outage1 ] ) will be satisfied .",
    "a similar discussion follows for ( [ outage2 ] ) as well .    in the subsequent parts of the paper , we assume that an average interference power constraint in the form given in ( [ average interference power ] ) is imposed .",
    "in this section , we identify the maximum throughput that the cognitive radio channel with the aforementioned state - transition model can sustain under interference power constraints and statistical qos limitations imposed in the form of buffer or delay violation probabilities . wu and negi in @xcite defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported by a given channel service process while also satisfying a statistical qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath117 .",
    "if we define @xmath50 as the stationary queue length , then @xmath117 is defined as the decay rate of the tail distribution of the queue length @xmath50 : @xmath118 hence , we have the following approximation for the buffer violation probability for large @xmath119 : @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , larger @xmath117 corresponds to more strict qos constraints , while the smaller @xmath117 implies looser constraints . in certain settings , constraints on the queue length",
    "can be linked to limitations on the delay and hence delay - qos constraints .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath121 for constant arrival rates , where @xmath122 denotes the steady - state delay experienced in the buffer . in the above formulation",

    "since the average arrival rate is equal to the average departure rate when the queue is in steady - state @xcite , effective capacity can also be seen as the maximum throughput in the presence of such constraints .",

    "therefore , the service rate in this state is effectively zero .    in the next result",

    "@xmath152    now , using the optimal transmission policies given in ( [ optimalpolicy1 ] ) and ( [ optimalpolicy2 ] ) , we can express the effective capacity as follows : @xmath169 above , the subscripts @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the expectations denote that the lower limits of the integrals are equal these values and not to zero .",

    "therefore , the criterion for choosing the transmission band among multiple busy bands unless there is no idle band detected , or among multiple idle bands if there are idle bands detected should be based on this ratio of the channel gains . clearly , the strategy that maximizes the effective capacity is to choose the channel ( or equivalently the frequency band ) with the highest ratio of @xmath173 .",
    "this is also intuitively appealing as we want to maximize @xmath95 to improve the secondary transmission and at the same time minimize @xmath94 to diminish the interference caused to the primary users . maximizing @xmath173",
    "provides us the right balance in the channel selection .",

    ", we first provide expressions for the probabilities of operating in each one of the four scenarios described in section [ subsec : state ] .",
    "these probabilities are also important metrics in analyzing the performance .",
    "we have @xmath194    in figure [ fig : fig4 ] , we plot these probabilities as a function of the detection probability @xmath195 for two cases in which the number of channels is @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "as expected , we observe that @xmath198 and @xmath199 decrease with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "we also see that @xmath200 and @xmath201 are assuming small values when @xmath195 is very close to 1 . note from fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] that as @xmath195 approaches 1 , the false alarm probability @xmath202 increases as well .",
    "the analysis in the preceding sections apply for arbitrary joint distributions of @xmath95 and @xmath94 under the mild assumption that the they have finite means ( i.e. , fading has finite average power ) . in this subsection , we consider a rayleigh fading scenario in which the power gains @xmath95 and @xmath94 are exponentially distributed .",
    "we assume that @xmath95 and @xmath94 are mutually independent and each has unit - mean .",
    "then , the pdf and cdf of @xmath173 can be expressed as follows : @xmath203    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we plot the effective capacity vs. probability of detection , @xmath41 , for different number of channels when the average interference power constraint normalized by the noise power is @xmath204db , where @xmath205 is the noise variance at the primary user .",
    "we observe that with increasing @xmath41 , the effective capacity is increasing due to the fact more reliable detection of the activity primary users leads to fewer miss - detections and hence the probability of scenario 3 or equivalently the probability of being in state @xmath87 , in which the transmission rate is effectively zero , diminishes .",
    "we also interestingly see that the highest effective capacity is attained when @xmath196 .",
    "hence , secondary users seem to not benefit from the availability of multiple channels .",
    "this is especially pronounced for high values of @xmath195 .",
    "although several factors and parameters are in play in determining the value of the effective capacity , one explanation for this observation is that the probabilities of scenarios 1 and 2 , in which the secondary users transmit with power @xmath88 , decrease with increasing @xmath0 , while the probabilities of scenarios 3 and 4 increase as seen in ( [ scenarios ] ) .",
    "note that in scenario 3 , no reliable communication is possible and transmission rate is effectively zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , we display similar results when @xmath206db . hence ,",
    "secondary users operate under more stringent interference constraints . in this case",
    ", we note that @xmath207 gives the highest throughput while the performance with @xmath196 is strictly suboptimal .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] , we show the effective capacities as a function @xmath208 ( db ) for different values of @xmath0 when @xmath209 and @xmath210 . confirming our previous observation",
    ", we notice that as the interference constraint gets more strict and hence @xmath208 becomes smaller , a higher value of @xmath0 is needed to maximize the effective capacity .",
    "for instance , @xmath197 channels are needed when @xmath211db . on the other hand , for approximately @xmath212db ,",
    "having @xmath196 gives the highest throughput .",
    "above , we have remarked that increasing the number of available channels from which the transmission channel is selected provides no benefit or can even degrade the performance of secondary users under certain conditions .",
    "on the other hand , it is important to note that increasing @xmath0 always brings a benefit to the primary users in the form of decreased probability of interference . in order to quantify this type of gain",
    ", we consider below the probability that the channel selected for transmission is actually busy and hence the primary user in this channel experiences interference : @xmath213 note that @xmath214 depends on @xmath195 and also @xmath202 through @xmath215 .",
    "it can be easily seen that this interference probability @xmath214 decreases with increasing @xmath0 when @xmath216 .",
    "as @xmath0 goes to infinity , we have @xmath217 indeed , in this asymptotic regime , @xmath214 becomes zero with perfect detection ( i.e. , with @xmath218 ) .",
    "note that secondary users transmit ( if @xmath219 ) even when all channels are detected as busy . as @xmath220 , the probability of such an event vanishes .",
    "also , having @xmath218 enables the secondary users to avoid scenario 3 .",
    "hence , interference is not caused to the primary users .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , we plot @xmath214 vs. the detection probability for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we also display how the false alarm probability evolves as @xmath195 varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "it can be easily seen that while @xmath221 when @xmath196 , a smaller @xmath214 is achieved for higher values of @xmath0 unless @xmath218 . on the other hand ,",
    "as also discussed above , we immediately note that @xmath214 monotonically decreases to 0 as @xmath195 increases to 1 when @xmath0 is unbounded ( i.e. , @xmath220 ) .",
    "nakagami fading occurs when multipath scattering with relatively large delay - time spreads occurs .",
    "therefore , nakagami distribution matches some empirical data better than many other distributions do . with this motivation",
    ", we also consider nakagami fading in our numerical results .",
    "the pdf of the nakagami-@xmath222 random variable @xmath223 is given by @xmath224 where @xmath222 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "if both @xmath94 and @xmath95 have the same number of degrees of freedom , we can express the pdf of @xmath225 as follows : @xmath226 note also that rayleigh fading is a special case of nakagami fading when @xmath227 . in our experiments",
