    "the _ standard model _ of few - nucleon systems , where nucleon and pion degrees of freedom are taken into account , is already at a very sophisticated stage , and many efforts are presently carried on to retain all the _ general principles _ of a theory with a fixed number of constituents . in particular , to satisfy poincar covariance appears a quite reachable goal and at the same time a very compelling requirement in view of the forthcoming measurements of electromagnetic ( em ) form factors ( ff s ) for a=3,4 , in the region of few gev s @xcite . in order to extract unambiguous signatures of effects beyond the _ standard model _ of few - nucleon systems one should develop a fully field - theoretical approach , based on the bethe - salpeter equation , but the difficulties are well - known , and therefore one has to consider alternative approaches , like 3-d reductions ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a=2 and @xcite for the work in progress for a=3 ) or the relativistic hamiltonian dynamics ( rhd ) framework , suggested by dirac in a seminal paper @xcite .",
    "our aim is to construct , within the light - front form of rhd , a relativistic approach for few - nucleon system that i ) retains the whole _",
    "successful phenomenology _ already developed and ii ) includes , _ in a non perturbative way _ , the relativistic features requested by poincar covariance . in order to have a strong and immediate comparison with the experiments we have focused our efforts on the development of poincar covariant calculations of the electromagnetic ff s , extending our approach from the deuteron @xcite to the trinucleon .",
    "the adopted bakamjian - thomas ( bt ) procedure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) allows us to exploit realistic wave functions for few - nucleon systems ( for a=3 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) in order to evaluate matrix elements of a poincar covariant current operator @xcite for an interacting system .",
    "the relativistic effects imposed by poincar covariance materialize in the relativistic kinematics and in the presence of the so - called melosh rotations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , that allows one to use the standard clebsh - gordan machinery to obtain many - nucleon wave functions with the correct angular coupling .",
    "as well - known @xcite , light - front ( lf ) rhd has some appealing features , like the largest number of kinematical poincar generators ( given the symmetry of the _ initial _",
    "hypersurface @xmath1 ) and the simplest procedure for separating out the center of mass motion from the intrinsic one , in strict analogy with the nonrelativistic procedure . moreover , it shares with the other two rhd s ( instant and point forms ) the rigorous fulfillment of the poincar covariance , for a system with a fixed number of constituents . in some sense , rhd s fall between non - relativistic quantum mechanics and the local , relativistic field theory .    for an interacting system ,",
    "an em current operator , @xmath2 , that fulfills the extended poincar covariance ( i.e. including parity and time reversal ) and hermiticity , can be constructed by a suitable auxiliary operator , @xmath3 , that fulfills rotational covariance around the @xmath4-axis in a breit frame ( @xmath5 ) , where the @xmath6 component of the momentum transfer is vanishing ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "note that such a frame is _ different _ from the drell - yan one , where @xmath8 . in general @xcite ,",
    "the matrix elements @xmath9 , still acting on internal variables , are directly given by the matrix elements of the auxiliary operator @xmath3 , evaluated in the chosen breit frame .",
    "a minimal ansatz for a _ many - body _ auxiliary operator is built from i ) the free current ( a one - body operator ) and ii ) the @xmath6 component of the angular momentum operator @xmath10 ( a many - body operator in lf ) as follows j^_fi(q_z)=1 2   [ curlf]with @xmath11 , @xmath12 projector onto the states of the ( initial or final ) system and @xmath13 the lf - spin operator of the system as whole : it acts on the `` internal '' space and is unitarily related to the standard angular momentum operator through the melosh operators .",
    "let us remind that @xmath14 is the proper sum over a=2,3 free nucleon current given by @xmath15(p^\\mu+p^{\\prime \\mu})/2 m + \\gamma^\\mu ( f_{1}[(p^{\\prime \\mu}-p^\\mu)^2]+f_{2}[(p^{\\prime \\mu}-p^\\mu)^2])$ ] , with @xmath16 $ ] the dirac ( pauli ) nucleon ff . in our breit frame , charge normalization and current conservation ( for @xmath17 ) can be fulfilled by imposing @xmath18@xcite .    for evaluating matrix elements of @xmath19 , eigenstates of the interacting system are needed . to this end",
    "one can use the `` non relativistic solutions '' , but with melosh rotations in the angular part , if the interaction @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the mass operator of the interacting ( free ) system ) can be embedded in a bt framework .",
    "the bt construction for obtaining interacting poincar generators suggests a necessary ( not sufficient ) condition @xcite on the interaction : @xmath22 must depend upon intrinsic variables combined in scalar products , i.e. @xmath23 = [ \\vec s_{0 } , v ] =   [ p_{\\perp } , v ] = [ p^+ , v ] = 0 $ ] , where @xmath24 are the lf boosts , @xmath25 the angular momentum operator for the non interacting case ( since @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the eigenvalues of @xmath28 and @xmath29 can label the eigenstates of the interacting system ) .",
    "the non relativistic interaction fulfills the above requirements .",
    "first , let us briefly review our results for the deuteron , and then we present preliminary calculations for the trinucleon case .    magnetic and quadrupole moments of the deuteron ( see table 1 ) , as well as the ff s , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the tensor polarization @xmath32 have been calculated @xcite , showing the great relevance of the poincar covariance , even at low @xmath33 . from our results , one could argue that the role of mec and pair contributions should shrink , but clearly a direct evaluation of two - body contributions is mandatory for a closer comparison with experiments .",

    "this extraction has been analyzed adopting a standard approach @xcite , and here we would simply recall that a lf approach could give remarkably different results . by using the impulse approximation , the deuteron structure function can be expressed through a convolution of the nucleon structure functions and the distribution probability , @xmath42 , to find inside @xmath43h a nucleon with lf momentum @xmath4 . in the usual approach",
