    "the determination of heavy - light decay constants and form factors relevant to ckm phenomenology is a priority for lattice qcd .",
    "however , to make a meaningful contribution the statistical and systematic uncertainties in these calculations must be reduced to a few percent for simulations carried out in the full theory .",
    "this is extremely costly , and new methods to improve precision while keeping computational costs modest are important .",
    "we report preliminary results from our investigations of heavy - light physics on anisotropic lattices using stout links and all - to - all propagators .",
    "the gauge action used in the simulations described here is symanzik - improved with a negative adjoint term .",
    "it has been used previously in a study of glueballs  @xcite and in an exploratory study of quenched heavy - quark physics on anisotropic lattices  @xcite .",
    "the fermion action is designed specifically for large anisotropies when the temporal lattice spacing @xmath2 is much finer than the spatical lattice spacing , @xmath3 .",
    "it incorporates the usual wilson term in the temporal direction and a hamber ",
    "wu term in the spatial directions to remove doublers .",
    "the action has been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and is written @xmath4 where the prime indicates that fields have been rotated , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the spatial derivative is improved with a two - hop term .",
    "the usual wilson parameter is @xmath7 and the wilson - like parameter @xmath8 . to reduce the coupling to uv gluon modes we use stout links  @xcite .",
    "the preservation of differentiability with respect to the link variables of this smearing technique means that the hybrid monte carlo algorithm can be straightforwardly applied .",
    "quantum fluctuations renormalise the anisotropy @xmath9 , and the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the gauge and quark actions respectively must be tuned such that the measured anisotropy takes its required value . in the quenched theory the gluon and quark actions can be separately tuned .",
    "however , in unquenched simulations this is no longer true and the quarks and gluons must have a common anisotropy to recover the correct continuum limit of the theory . the non - perturbative tuning of this action is under investigation .",
    "we require that the anisotropy measured from the sideways potential agrees with that determined from the low - momentum relativistic pion dispersion relation .",
    "this simultaneous tuning requires three initial simulations to find the self - consistent point  @xcite .",
    "the results presented here are based on one ( untuned ) simulation .",
    "the results do not therefore have a physical interpretation ; the point of interest is rather the precision which can be reached using anisotropic lattices and all - to - all propagators .",
    "in this exploratory simulation we use the hybrid monte carlo algorithm with @xmath1 and degenerate sea and valence quark masses .",
    "we have generated 250 gauge configurations on a @xmath12 lattice , with @xmath13 .",

    "figure  [ fig : pi - disp ] shows the light pseudoscalar meson dispersion relation obtained from point propagators and jacobi smeared quark fields .",
    "the quark mass is close to the strange quark and the point @xmath19 corresponds to momentum @xmath20 in units of @xmath21 or @xmath22gev .",
    "this result is encouraging since it implies that high - momentum light pseudoscalars can be reliably simulated on these dynamical lattices .",
    "this is relevant for studies of semileptonic decays such as @xmath23 which have in the past been restricted to the low - momentum regime .",
    "we have not explicitly disentangled the benefits of the anisotropic lattice from the stout links but experience in the quenched case without stout links , indicates that spatial momenta higher than @xmath24 are difficult to resolve , implying that stout links play an important rle in these high - momentum simulations .",

    "a new algorithm to estimate all - to - all propagators was presented at this conference  @xcite . with all - to - all propagators",

    "@xcite uses low - mode dominance corrected with a stochastic estimator which yields the exact all - to - all propagator in a finite number of quark inversions .",
    "once again we use stout link smearing on the gauge fields and jacobi smearing on the ( light ) quarks .",
    "we now study the effect of these all - to - all propagators on the static - light correlator .",
    "although relatively cheap to calculate , this is known to be noisy and difficult to determine with precision .",
    "in addition , using all - to - all propagators in the static approximation means that @xmath0 can be extracted from a combination of smeared - local ( sl ) and smeared - smeared ( ss ) correlators rather than the restriction to local - local ( ll ) and sl correlators when point sources are used .",
    "the advantages are clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : bmass - all2all ] .     have been hidden for the sake of clarity . ]",
    "the plot shows the effective mass of a heavy - light meson determined using both point and all - to - all propagators .",
    "the heavy quark was simulated in the static approximation and the light quark is close to the strange quark mass .",
    "it is important to note that the all - to - all dataset consists of 130 configurations whereas the equivalent statistical precision using point sources requires 250 configurations .    using point sources the effective mass and amplitude ( which yields @xmath0 ) is determined from a combination of the ll and sl data in a region where they overlap .",
    "figure  [ fig : bmass - all2all ] shows that this is true only for a few timeslices but also that the purely local data in that region are becoming very noisy , decreasing the reliability and precision with which @xmath0 can be extracted .",
    "in contrast , the all - to - all datasets agree over a much larger number of timeslices reducing the uncertainties in the fitted mass and amplitude .",

    "the vertical spread represents the systematic error in the extracted value of @xmath25 as the fit range is varied for the point ll and sl correlators and for the all - to - all sl and ss correlators respectively .",
    "the plots are on the same scale and the all - to - all data are very impressive especially since these required only half the number of configurations compared to the point sources .",
    "the static - light matrix element was computed using all - to - all propagators for the light quark on an anisotropic ( but untuned ) lattice with @xmath1 , using a stout - link background .",
    "the great advantage of being able to use smeared - smeared correlators was demonstrated by a direct comparison with the effective mass taken from conventional point propagators .",
    "the tuning of the improved , dynamical anisotropic action is currently being carried out , and the resulting parameters will be used for a determination of @xmath0 . work is also in progress to study radially excited s - waves and p - waves ; the preliminary results of this are highly encouraging .",
