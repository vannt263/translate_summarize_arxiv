    "<S> we apply in this paper the statefinder parameters to the interacting phantom energy with dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> there are two kinds of scaling solutions in this model . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the evolving trajectories of these two scaling solutions in the statefinder parameter plane are quite different , and that are also different from the statefinder diagnostic of other dark energy models .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmic observations indicate that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion and the dominated component of the present universe is dark energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite experiment tells us that dark energy , dark matter , and the usual baryonic matter occupy about @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 of the total energy of the universe , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the accelerated expansion of the present universe is attributed to the dark energy whose essence is quite unusual and there is no justification for assuming that it resembles known forms of matter or energy . </S>",
    "<S> candidates for dark energy have been widely studied and focus on the cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite with @xmath4 , a dynamically evolving scalar field ( quintessence ) @xcite with @xmath5 and phantom @xcite with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a study of high-@xmath7 ( @xmath7 is redshift ) sne ia @xcite find that the equation of state of dark energy has a @xmath8 probability of being @xmath6 if no priors are placed on @xmath9 . when these sne results are combined with </S>",
    "<S> cmb and 2dfgrs the @xmath10 confidence limits on an unevolving equation of state are @xmath11 @xcite which is consistent with estimates made by other groups @xcite . in order to obtain @xmath6 , phantom field with reverse sign in its dynamical term </S>",
    "<S> may be a simplest way and can be regarded as one of interesting possibilities describing dark energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the other physical properties of phantom energy are rather weird , as they include violation of the dominant - energy condition , naive superluminal sound speed and increasing energy density with time . </S>",
    "<S> the latter property ultimately leads to unwanted future singularity called big rip which had been considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity is characterized by the divergence of the scale factor in a finite time in future @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many authors have discussed various kinds of phantom field models to avoid the cosmic doomsday @xcite , which require a special class of phantom field potentials with a local maximum . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the energy density of the phantom field increases with time , while the energy density of the matter fluid decreases as the universe expands . </S>",
    "<S> why are the energy density of dark matter and the phantom energy density of the same order just at the present epoch ? </S>",
    "<S> this coincidence problem becomes more difficult to solve in the phantom model without the suitable interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but guo et al . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed a suitable interaction in the phantom field model , and the coincidence problem can be avoided . </S>",
    "<S> moreover in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the universe also avoids the big rip . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , considering a universe model which contains phantom field @xmath12 and the dark matter @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the friedmann equation in a spatially flat frw metric can be written as follows : @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath13 is the energy density of the dark matter , and the dark matter possesses the equation of state @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density and pressure of the phantom field @xmath12 are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the phantom field potential , @xmath23 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we postulate that the two component @xmath18 and @xmath13 , interact through the interaction term @xmath24 according to @xmath25 @xmath26 here , the interaction term has the specific formation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a dimensionless parameter denoting the transfer strength . </S>",
    "<S> we define the following dimensionless variables @xmath29 thus the fractional densities of @xmath30 and @xmath13 are @xmath31 the evolution equations ( [ de ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) can be written as the following set of equations : @xmath32 where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to the logarithm of the scale factor , @xmath33 . from the definitions of these new variables , we find that the equation of state of phantom @xmath34 is @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> so we get the effective parameter of equation - of - state of the phantom is @xmath36 and the effective equation of state for the total cosmic fluid is @xmath37 guo et al . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite had concluded that in the case of the interaction ( [ q ] ) , there exist two stable scaling solutions , the climbing - up scaling solution and the rolling - down scaling solution . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the universe evolves from a matter - dominated phase to a scaling solution , which is characterized by a constant ratio of the energy densities of the dark matter and the phantom field , which may give a phenomenological solution of the coincidence problem . in the climbing - up case </S>",
    "<S> , the phantom field initially climbs up , the effective equation of state @xmath38 realizes a transition from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and the universe ends with a big rip . in the rolling - down case , the phantom field initially rolls down , the effective equation of state tends to above @xmath41 and realizes a transition from @xmath42 to @xmath39 , in this case the cosmic doomsday is avoided and the universe accelerates forever . </S>",
    "<S> there have been so many models that proposed to explain the cosmic acceleration and solve , or at least alleviate , the coincidence problem @xcite . in order to discriminate this interacting phantom model from others , and differentiate these two scaling solutions further , we refer to a cosmological diagnostic pair @xmath43 called statefinder which is introduced by sahni et al . in @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> defined as @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the deceleration parameter . the statefinder is a `` geometrical '' diagnostic in the sense that it depends on the expansion factor and hence on the metric describing space - time . since different cosmological models involving dark energy exhibit qualitatively different evolution trajectories in the @xmath46 plane , this statefinder diagnostic can differentiate various kinds of dark energy models . for the spatially flat lcdm cosmological model , </S>",
    "<S> the statefinder parameters correspond to a fixed point @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> s far , some models including the cosmological constant , quintessence , phantom , quintom , the chaplygin gas , braneworld models , holographic models , interacting and coupling dark energy models @xcite , have been successfully differentiated . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the quintessence model with inverse power law potential , the phantom model with power law potential and the chaplygin gas model all tend to approach the lcdm fixed point , but for quintessence and phantom models the trajectories lie in the regions @xmath48 while for chaplygin gas model the trajectories lie in the regions @xmath49 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we apply the statefinder diagnostic to the coupled phantom model . to begin with </S>",
    "<S> , we use another form of statefinder parameters in terms of the total energy density @xmath50 and the total pressure @xmath51 in the universe : @xmath52 since the total energy of the universe is conserved , we have @xmath53 . then making use of @xmath54 , we can get @xmath55 where @xmath56 . and </S>",
    "<S> the deceleration parameter is also given @xmath57    in the following we will discuss the statefinder for two scaling solutions with different conditions in ref @xcite , and investigate how the interaction between phantom and dark matter influences the evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we discuss the scaling solution @xmath58 in the case of the interaction form ( [ q ] ) , which exists for @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the initially velocity of the phantom field ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 is defined as a cubic function ) and corresponds to a climbing - up phantom field . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the universe ends with a big rip . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ sr1 ] we show the time evolution of the statefinder pairs @xmath43 and @xmath63 for the climbing - up scaling solution . </S>",
    "<S> the plot is for variable interval @xmath64 $ ] , and the selected evolution trajectories of @xmath65 and @xmath66 correspond to @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 represents no interaction between phantom field and dark matter , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the different transfer strength of interaction between de and dm . </S>",
    "<S> we see clearly that the curve will pass through the lcdm fixed point when there is no coupling ( @xmath68 ) between phantom field and dark matter , while the distant from the curves to lcdm scenario is considerable when exists the interaction between phantom field and dark matter . </S>",
