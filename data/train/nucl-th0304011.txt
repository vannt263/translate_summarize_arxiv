    "hadron - hadron total cross sections are important characteristics of the dynamics of hadronic systems .",
    "theoretical descriptions of the reaction process , however , remain incomplete as the mechanism of how hadrons interact contains important aspects of non - perturbative qcd . a phenomenological description of donnachie and landshoff @xcite gives the total cross section in terms of the exchange of a pomeron and a reggeon .",
    "the exchange of a pomeron dominates the cross section at high energies .",
    "it corresponds to the exchange of a tower of fictitious particles on a regge trajectory with a regge intercept of approximately 1 .",
    "the exchange of a reggeon dominates the cross section at low energies .",
    "it corresponds to the exchange of @xmath9 on the regge trajectory with a regge intercept of approximately 0.5 .",
    "it is desirable to study microscopic models of total hadron - hadron cross sections at high energies .",
    "the total cross sections provide useful information on the sizes of hadrons and the dynamics between them .",
    "furthermore , they are important input data for the investigation of other reaction processes . for example , in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , the suppression of @xmath5 production has been proposed as a signature for the production of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . however , the suppression of @xmath5 production can also arise from the collision of @xmath5 with hadrons at high energies .",
    "it is necessary to understand the absorption of @xmath5 by hadrons before one can unambiguously identify the quark - gluon plasma as the source of @xmath5 suppression @xcite .",
    "while the systematic studies of donnachie and landshoff provide very valuable information on the total cross section of many hadron - hadron systems , there are reactions ( involving , for example , @xmath5 ) for which data are not available .",
    "they can only be evaluated theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to develop a microscopic theory of hadron - hadron collisions at high energies .",
    "as the pomeron exchange is the dominant process in high - energy hadron - hadron reactions , it is useful to model the exchange of a pomeron explicitly in microscopic terms .",
    "previously , the pomeron exchange in a hadron - hadron reaction was studied in terms of the exchange of two gluons .",
    "the two - gluon model of the pomeron ( tgmp ) , first proposed by low @xcite and nussinov @xcite , was further investigated by gunion and soper @xcite who introduced an effective gluon mass to mimic the confinement of the colored gluon .",
    "they examined the effects of the size of the bound - state hadrons and the number of quarks they contain .",
    "landshoff and nachtmann generalized the concept of the gluon condensate to the correlation length of the gluon field in the vacuum and discussed the short - range nature of the effective gluon exchange between quarks in hadron - hadron scattering @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the cross sections on the sizes and the color states of the colliding hadrons was considered by doleji and h \" ufner @xcite .",
    "they obtained useful analytical and numerical results for the total cross sections of many hadron - hadron systems .",
    "the effects of channel coupling for the propagation of a radially - excited hadron @xcite was investigated in the two - gluon model of the pomeron by wong @xcite who also evaluated many meson - nucleon total cross sections .",
    "we shall follow the approach of gunion , soper , landshoff , nachtmann , doleji , hfner , and wong to study the hadron - hadron total cross section , with the following refinements .",
    "we shall use a set of meson wave functions obtained from meson mass calculations @xcite to replace the simple form factors used in earlier studies .",
    "this allows a more detailed and systematic study of the hadron - hadron scattering processes involving a much large set of hadrons than those investigated previously .",
    "gunion and soper @xcite , doleji and hfner @xcite , and wong @xcite made use of only a single screened color - coulomb potential to represent the non - perturbative gluon exchange .",
    "we shall instead represent the gluon exchange between the constituents of one hadron and constituents of the other hadron by a phenomenological potential containing screened color - coulomb , screened color - confining , and spin - spin interactions @xcite . screening arises when the interaction between a constituent of one hadron and a constituent of another hadron occurs at large distances for which the production of dynamical quarks screens the interaction .",
    "the use of a more complicated potential allows a greater degree of flexibility , which provides a better description of non - perturbative effects in scattering .",
    "it also enables one to use reasonable strong interaction coupling constants , as the constraint of using a single screened color - coulomb interaction may sometimes lead to values of @xmath10 larger than unity @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spin - spin interaction is known to be important in non - relativistic quark models .",
    "its phenomenological incorporation here will allow us to evaluate the variation of the total cross section in reactions of mesons with different total spin quantum numbers and quarks of different flavors .",
    "similar to earlier works of doleji and hfner @xcite , and wong @xcite , we shall first obtain the the screening mass and the strength of the interaction to reproduce the experimental @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 cross sections at @xmath14 gev .",
    "we then use the theoretical meson wave functions to calculate other cross sections .",
    "based on the energy dependence of the phenomenological description of total hadron - hadron cross sections found by donnachie and landshoff @xcite , we shall then extend our results to higher energies .    in reactions involving heavy quarkonium production in nuclear collisions , the initial heavy quark pair produced as a result of a parton - parton collision is a coherent state of a color admixture and different projections of this state will lead to different final heavy quarkonia @xcite .",
    "we will also examine the color dependence of the cross section , in order to understand how a colored heavy quark pair propagates in a hadronic medium @xcite .",
    "the nucleons with which the produced charmonium collide can also acquire a color as a result of prior collisions and may collide with a color - singlet charmonium @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall limit our discussion to the problem of the interaction of a colored charmonium state with a color - singlet hadron .",
    "our approach to study the total cross section in the tgmp differs from that of the additive quark model @xcite and the dipole model of photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the total cross sections obtained in different models can naturally be different .",
    "careful comparison of these different results with experimental data will be useful to determine the importance of various scattering mechanisms that are present in the interaction of hadrons .",

    "ii we describe the model used to calculate the hadron - hadron elastic scattering amplitude at high energies . in sec .",

    "v we present results for total hadron - hadron cross sections and the energy dependence of the total hadron - hadron cross sections . in sec .",
    "vi we evaluate the total cross sections of a mixed - color charmonium state scattering on a pion or a proton .",
    "the dependences of the total cross sections on the size and the color of the initial charmonium state are investigated .",
    "finally , we present our summary and conclusions in sec .",
    "to calculate the total cross section in a hadron - hadron collision , we consider the hadron - hadron elastic scattering amplitude @xmath15 . according to the optical theorem ,",
    "the imaginary part of the elastic scattering amplitude at zero momentum transfer gives the total hadron - hadron cross section .",
    "the elastic scattering process between two hadrons at high energies is dominated by the exchange of a pomeron , as evidenced by the slow variation of the total cross section with energy , the property of having an approximately purely imaginary forward scattering amplitude , and the dominance of no quantum number flow in the fragmentation region in forward inelastic processes .",
    "the phenomenological treatment of the total cross section as arising from the exchange of a pomeron with a regge trajectory intercept of 1.0808 , and the exchange of a reggeon from the trajectory of @xmath9 with an intercept of 0.5475 , gives an excellent representation of many hadron - hadron total cross sections @xcite .",
    "the small deviations of these regge trajectory intercepts from the lowest - order expectations of 1.0 and 0.5 respectively have been attributed to higher - order effects @xcite .    in this work , we shall model the exchange of a pomeron in terms of the exchange of gluons . as the exchange of a single gluon would lead to an exchange of color ,",
    "the lowest number of gluon exchanges with no net color flow is the exchange of two gluons , proposed first by low @xcite and nussinov @xcite and studied by gunion , soper , landshoff , nachtmann , doleji , hfner , and wong @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we express the total hadron - hadron cross section in terms of the hadron - hadron elastic scattering amplitude at zero four - momentum transfer squared @xmath16 @xmath17    following gunion and soper @xcite and doleji and hfner @xcite , we obtain the forward scattering amplitude @xmath15 by including diagrams of the type shown in fig",

    "@xcite ) . after integrating over the time - like and",
    "the longitudinal loop momenta using these two delta functions , the resultant effective gluon propagators involve only transverse momenta ( or equivalently only transverse coordinates ) @xcite .",
    "when we represent the effective gluon propagator phenomenologically by an interaction , the interaction @xmath35 in transverse coordinates , written explicitly as @xmath36 , can be obtained by integrating the interaction @xmath37 over the longitudinal coordinate @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the three - dimensional relative coordinate between the interacting particles @xmath18 and @xmath20 and @xmath41 its transverse component . defining the fourier transform of @xmath42 as @xmath43 by @xmath44",

    "as the interaction between the constituents takes place at large distances , we are well advised to use a screened potential to represent the effects of dynamical quarks .",

    "it is interesting to note that our tgmp total cross sections for @xmath0+@xmath0 , and @xmath2+@xmath0 are respectively 27.4 and 20.8 mb , which are significantly larger than the predictions of of about @xmath187 mb from the additive quark model .",
    "the large magnitude of the total cross sections in the present calculation arises from the spin - spin interaction , as the cross sections become much smaller if the spin - spin interaction is turned off .",
    "experimental information of the @xmath2+@xmath188 cross section can be inferred from @xmath2-meson photoproduction cross sections .",
    "the extracted total cross section depends on the coupling constant @xmath189 and the value of @xmath190 , which is the ratio of the real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude @xcite .",
    "it also depends on the generalizations of the vector dominance model in which one may include higher resonances and off - diagonal matrix elements @xcite .",
    "using the simple vdm with @xmath190 assumed to be zero and @xmath189 set to be 2.20 , the zeus collaboration found @xmath191 for @xmath192 gev @xcite which is close to the value of @xmath193 obtained in the present calculation for @xmath192 gev ( see fig .",

    "the experimental data can not be compared directly with the present theoretical prediction .",
    "one can nevertheless get some idea on the magnitude of @xmath194 . using photoproduction data from a number of different nuclei ,",

    "however , from their subsequent extended measurements and refined analysis they obtain @xmath198 and @xmath199 with @xmath200 @xcite for photons at 4.4 - 8.8 gev ( @xmath201 3.02 - 4.17 gev ) .    from an extensive optical model analysis taking the ratio @xmath190 to be -0.2 , alvensleben @xmath111",

    "an independent determination of the @xmath205 total cross section , using the @xmath206 differential cross sections , was carried out by anderson @xmath111 who obtained @xmath207 and @xmath208 at a photon energy of 18 gev ( @xmath2015.98 gev ) @xcite .    in our non - relativistic potential model ,",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath209 have the same spin and spatial wave functions .",
    "consequently , within the two - gluon model of the pomeron , @xmath210 .",
    "the value of @xmath211 extracted from experimental photoproduction data depends again on the coupling constant @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath211 range from @xmath214 mb @xcite at 6.8 gev ( @xmath215 gev ) to 25.4@xmath2162.7 mb at 8.3 gev @xcite ( @xmath2014.06 gev ) .    our examination of the experimental @xmath182 and @xmath217 cross sections at low energies indicates that they appear to range from 23 mb to 38 mb and the uncertainties are large .",
    "the cross section depends on energy , and the only data point of @xmath218 at @xmath201 70 gev that can be direct compared with the tgmp model indicates approximate agreement between the theoretical result with experiment .",
    "however , much more work needs to be done to confront the predictions of the tgmp and the additive quark model with the results of photoproduction experiments .    for the @xmath219 reaction the present results give a theoretical total cross section of 17.1 mb at @xmath14 gev , which agrees with the naive additive quark model of @xmath220 the experimental photoproduction data give a @xmath221 which ranges from 9.2 mb to 17.6 mb for photons at 6.4 - 9.3 gev ( @xmath222 gev ) , depending on the values of @xmath223 and @xmath224 assumed .",
    "the tgmp gives a theoretical total cross section of @xmath2257.6 mb at @xmath201 20 gev . from the absorption of @xmath5 in @xmath188@xmath226 collisions , an effective @xmath227 dissociation cross section of about 4 - 6 mb",

    "thus , a theoretical result of @xmath2307.6 mb in which the predominant component may be the dissociation cross section , is approximately consistent with the experimental dissociation cross section of about 4 - 6 mb .",
    "it remains necessary to determined more quantitatively how the @xmath227 cross section depends on energy , how much of the total cross section of @xmath227 can be attributed to dissociation of @xmath5 into an open - charm pair , and whether the observed absorption of @xmath5 inside a nucleus may involve an admixture of charmonium states with a color - octet component .",
    "the total @xmath5+@xmath188 cross section can also be extracted from the dipole model of photoproduction @xcite . in this model ,",
    "light cone wave functions for the virtual photon and charmonium are assumed , and a universal dipole cross section is introduced to fit proton structure function at small @xmath231 and a wide range of @xmath232 .",
    "the dipole model gives @xmath233 mb at @xmath14 gev , which is lower than the value of 7.6 mb obtained here in the tgmp model .",
    "experimental data indicate that at high energies total hadron - hadron cross sections increase slowly with energy .",
    "this energy dependence is beyond the scope of the present tgmp model .",
    "we can include such a dependence phenomenologically , by assuming that the strength parameters of the interaction depend on energy .",
    "specifically , we assume the energy dependence given by donnachie and landshoff @xcite , and parametrize the energy dependence of the interaction strengths as @xmath234 @xmath235 where @xmath236 ^ 2= { x s^{0.0808 } + y s^{-0.4525 } \\over   ( x s^{0.0808 } + y s^{-0.4525 } ) \\biggr |_{\\sqrt{s}=20~{\\rm gev } } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath237 mb , @xmath238 mb , and @xmath239 is in gev@xmath150 .",
    "the energy dependence of our parameters has been so chosen that theoretical @xmath11 cross sections follow the energy dependence of donnachie and landshoff s parametrization of the total @xmath11 cross section , which represents a very good fit to the experimental @xmath11 data .",
    "using such an energy - dependence , we extend our results to energies near @xmath14 gev and beyond . the lines in fig .",
    "3 show our results for total cross sections as a function of @xmath240 .",

    "it can be seen that in regions where data are available , our results are consistent with experimental data .",
    "numerical results for total hadron - hadron cross sections are given in table i.    recently , from the elastic and proton - dissociative @xmath245 photoproduction data obtained by the zeus collaboration at hera @xcite , the non - resonant contributions were analyzed in terms of the fluctuation of a photon into a @xmath246 pair and their interaction with a nucleon @xcite . a model - dependent analysis of the non - resonant contribution by ryskin @xmath111 @xcite , based on the drell - sding approach @xcite , yields an effective total @xmath0@xmath188 cross section of @xmath247 for a pion - proton center - of - mass energy of about 50 gev @xcite .",

    "this is quite different from the case of a color - singlet charmonium ( @xmath259 ) scattering from a color - singlet hadron . for the case of the scattering of two color - singlet mesons , if we turn off the spin - spin interaction , the integrand in eq .",

    "\" ufner @xcite , we find that the theoretical total cross section for a color - octet meson is quite large .",
