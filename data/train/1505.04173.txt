    "r coronae borealis ( r crb ) is the prototype for its eponymous class of stars , which are very rare and have many unusual characteristics including extreme hydrogen deficiency and large , sudden declines in brightness of 8 magnitudes or more @xcite .",
    "these declines are caused by clouds of carbon dust forming near the atmospheres of the stars , which are later dissipated by radiation pressure .",
    "only about 100 r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are known in the galaxy .",
    "therefore , these stars may be the result of a rare form of stellar evolution or are in an evolutionary phase that lasts only a short time .",
    "two scenarios have been suggested for producing an rcb star : the double degenerate ( dd ) and the final helium - shell flash ( ff ) models @xcite . in the dd model ,",
    "an rcb star is the result of merger between a co- and a he - white dwarf ( wd ) @xcite .",
    "the derivation of cno isotopic ratios ( in particular the excess of @xmath4o ) in rcb stars favors the dd scenario for these stars @xcite . in the ff model ,",
    "a star evolving into a white dwarf undergoes a final helium - shell flash and expands to supergiant size @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", the star may have recently gone through a planetary nebula ( pn ) phase .",
    "three stars ( sakurai s object , v605 aql , and fg sge ) have been observed to undergo ff outbursts that transformed them from hot evolved stars into cool giants with spectroscopic properties similar to rcb stars .",
    "these ff stars are all surrounded by pne .",
    "several rcb stars have extended dust shells that are seen in reflected light in the visible or in emission from the far - ir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "infrared spectroscopy of rcb stars has been possible thanks to the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and the _ spitzer _ space telescope , which has permitted the extraction of the characteristics of the ir emitting dust shell around rcbs ( lambert et al .",
    "2001 ; garc ' ia - hern ' andez , rao & lambert 2011a , b , 2013 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the mass loss in r crb and v854 cen is bipolar @xcite .",
    "this geometry is very common in pne .",
    "further , the nebulosity , including cometary knots , seen around r  crb and uw cen has similar morphology to a pn shell ( * ? ? ?",
    "* clayton et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) . in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the shell around r crb is consistent with the scenarios suggested for the evolution of the rcb stars .",
    "radio observations containing the region around r  crb have been obtained from the first data release ( dr1 ) galactic arecibo l - band feed array h i ( galfa - hi ) survey @xcite .",
    "the galfa - hi survey provides both high resolution ( 4 ) and high sensitivity ( typical rms @xmath2 80 mk ) due to their 305-m aperture and the installation of the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) @xcite . fully reduced  narrow \" and  wide \" band data cubes were retrieved from the survey . the former provided 0.18 km s@xmath5 resolution in the local standard of rest ( lsr ) in the range v@xmath6 = @xmath7190 km s@xmath5 , while the latter provided 0.74 km s@xmath5 resolution in the range v@xmath6 = @xmath7750 km s@xmath5 . a full description of the data acquisition , which includes both drift and basketweave scanning , and reductions for the galfa - hi survey are presented by @xcite ( see their  3 and  4 , respectively ) .",

    "r  crb is v=5.8 mag and b - v = 0.6 mag @xcite . based on the absolute magnitude / effective temperature relationship found for the large magellanic cloud rcb stars , the absolute magnitude of r  crb is estimated to be m@xmath9=5 mag @xcite . for the analysis in this paper",
    ", we thus adopt a distance to r  crb of 1.4 kpc .",
    "the large extended far - ir shell , with a radius of @xmath210 , surrounding r  crb was discovered with _ iras _ and then studied further with the _ spitzer _  and _ herschel _ telescopes ( gillett et al . 1986 ; clayton et al .",

    "the pne around the ff stars , v605 aql , sakurai s object , and fg sge are still ionized .",
    "the shell around r  crb is not .",
    "there is a small subclass of rcb stars that are much hotter ( t@xmath11= 15,000 - 20,000 k ) than the typical rcb stars and are surrounded by pne @xcite .",
    "they are not hot enough at present to ionize their surrounding pne , but the nebulae have not had time to recombine .",
    "the shells around the cooler rcb stars could be old pne that have recombined .",
    "there are some strong similarities between the morphology of the shells of uw cen and r  crb , and some pne such as the eskimo nebula .",
    "cometary features seen in pne such as the eskimo are similar to those seen in these two rcb stars @xcite .",
    "the recombination time depends on the electron densities of the shells and could range from hundreds to thousands of years .",
    "if n@xmath12=200 @xmath13 , as assumed for sakurai s object , the recombination time for r  crb s pn shell would be @xmath2380 yr @xcite . the amount of time that r  crb has been an rcb star is unknown but it is one of the first variable stars to be discovered @xcite , so we know that it has been in its rcb star phase for at least 200 yr .",
    "the pne seen around the ff stars , sakurai s object and v605 aql , are thought to be @xmath22@xmath14 10@xmath3 yr old , both with expansion velocities of @xmath230 km s@xmath5 and radii of 0.35 pc for v605 aql and 0.7 pc for sakurai s object @xcite .",
    "a ff star may not be old enough to produce a pn shell of the size seen around r  crb as it only takes a few years for the star to reach its rcb - like phase after the ff @xcite .",
    "if the r crb shell is , in fact , a pn shell then it should be hydrogen rich @xcite .",
    "no pointed 21-cm measurements of any rcb circumstellar shells have been published previously . a visual inspection of the narrow band galfa - hi data cube through velocity space",
    "was performed to see if there were any obvious h i features .",
    "the search focused on @xmath730 km s@xmath5 of the v@xmath6 of r  crb @xmath2 37 km s@xmath5 ( the barycentric radial velocity of r  crb @xmath2 22.3 km s@xmath5 @xcite ) . no obvious structure was discerned .",
    "next , a 20  x 20  square region , roughly the size of the dust shell , centered on r  crb was selected , as well as a background region of the same size as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the background reference spectrum were subtracted from the spectrum toward the r  crb shell to determine if there is any h i emission that might be associated with the shell .",
    "while fluctuations in the background h i limit the comparison in many directions , one reference position , shown in figure 1 , has an h i spectrum that is identical within the noise to the spectrum averaged over the shell at the relevant velocities , and the difference spectrum ( figure 2 ) can be used to limit the h i mass of r  crb .",
    "the rms noise ( @xmath15 ) in the 0.18 km s@xmath5 channels of figure 2 is 27 mk . over a @xmath16 km s@xmath5 interval , this gives a @xmath17 limit on column density , n@xmath18 ( atoms cm@xmath10 ) in the r  crb shell of 4.9 @xmath14 10@xmath20 .",
    "this was derived using n@xmath18 = @xmath21 , where dv is the 21 cm channel spacing ( 0.18 km s@xmath5 ) and n@xmath22 is the number of channels ( @xmath2330 ) over the relevant velocity range .",

    "the corresponding @xmath17 limit on h  i in the r  crb shell is 0.3 m@xmath1 . assuming that the mass loss is contained in a shell that has been moving outward at 30 km s@xmath5 , the pn shell would take @xmath210@xmath26 yr to expand to r= 4 pc .",
    "a shell of that age would almost certainly have had time to recombine and become neutral .",
    "the number density of h in this shell would be low , similar to that seen in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , the fraction of h@xmath27 will be near zero , and all of the h will be atomic and neutral @xcite .",
    "the 21-cm measurements presented here put a strong upper limit on the h mass in the r  crb shell .",
    "a study of the gas and dust masses in the shell of the pn , ngc 6781 , gives a total shell mass of 0.86 m@xmath1 and a dust mass of 4 @xmath14 10@xmath28 m@xmath1 and therefore a gas - to - dust ratio of about 215 .",
    "assuming a gas - to - dust ratio of 200 , the amount of dust in the r  crb shell would be @xmath010@xmath28 m@xmath1 .",
    "20 and @xmath730 km s@xmath5 from the velocity of r crb .",
    "the feature at -70 km s@xmath5 is part of a large elongated emission not associated with the r  crb shell .",
    "the horizontal green dashed line is at temperature = 0.,width=288 ]      we have simulated the rcb dd formation scenario by running three binary wd merger models using our fully three - dimensional adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ( marcello & tohline , in prep ) . this code evolves density , total energy , and angular , vertical , and radial momenta on a rotating cartesian mesh . once started , the model is driven into closer contact by artificially removing angular momentum from the system at a rate of @xmath29 per orbit for several orbits . through amr , we are able to run the models in large grids whose box dimensions are @xmath30@xmath31 times larger than the orbital separation .",
    "this allows for a more accurate determination of mass loss from the system than on a smaller grid , where much of the material exiting the grid does not possess enough energy to escape .",
    "the initial conditions were created using the self - consistent field technique ( scf ) to create a detached synchronously rotating binary wd in equilibrium just shy of becoming semi - detached @xcite .",
    "each model run follows the merger of a co- and a he - wd in a close binary orbit .",
    "the q=0.8 and q=0.5 models have a hybrid co / he accretor , which as described by @xcite is a wd with a co core and a he envelope of about 0.1 m@xmath1 . the results , along with the initial conditions , of our simulations are summarized in table 1 .    in the models presented here between @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the initial mass escapes and",
    "is not expected to fall back onto the new merged star .",
    "therefore , in the three models described in table 1 the mass lost from the two wds , which could form into a circumstellar shell around the new rcb star , is @xmath210@xmath10 m@xmath1 .",
    "the gas that has escape velocity is @xmath3495% he so a maximum of 5% of the gas could condense into dust . assuming this and a different gas - to - dust ratio of 100 @xcite ,",
    "the amount of dust in such a shell would be @xmath25 x 10@xmath35 m@xmath1 .",
    "a different gas - to - dust ratio was adopted , since in this scenario the envelope is not pn - like .",
