    "it is widely accepted that stars more massive than @xmath7 end their lives in core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) after evolving through subsequent stages of nuclear burning until they have built up an iron core .",
    "the common types of ccsne are ib and ic , with respectively no hydrogen and no hydrogen or helium features in their spectra , and type ii with spectral hydrogen features @xcite",
    ". type ii supernovae ( sne ) in general result from the explosion of a star which has retained at least a part of its hydrogen envelope @xcite , and the differences among the subtypes ii - p , ii - l and iib are thought to result from the degree to which the envelope has been retained .",
    "the subtype will thus depend on progenitor properties ( initial mass , mass loss , metallicity , binarity , rotation ) .",
    "historically the subtypes ii - p and ii - l have been thought of as distinct populations of events @xcite , with a long plateau phase of near constant luminosity and a fast linear decline , respectively . @xcite and @xcite argued that these subtypes are not continuous , while other studies with larger samples of light curves @xcite have favoured a continuum of properties leading from ii - p to ii - l , with progenitor mass at zero - age main sequence ( zams ) likely being the dominant parameter . using the rise times of type ii sne",
    ", @xcite find no evidence of a bimodal ii - p / ii - l population , while @xcite rule out significantly smaller progenitor radii for ii - l .",
    "the exact , quantitative definition of a type ii - l sn is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "spectroscopically , they tend to exhibit strong h@xmath3 emission without the p cygni absorption profile common for type ii - p @xcite .",
    "photometrically , @xcite classified an event as ii - l if its _ v_-band magnitude declined more than 0.5 mag from the peak value in the first 50 days after the explosion , while @xcite applied the same criterion in the _ r _ band ; originally , barbon et al .",
    "( 1979 ) defined them as having a linear decline of about 0.05 mag d@xmath2 in _",
    "r_. due to the photometric continuum they found between the subtypes , @xcite suggested classifying both simply as type ii , with the ` plateau'-phase brightness decline rate as one of the main parameters of the sn .",
    "the plateau in a type ii - p sn is believed to be the result of an optically thick hydrogen recombination ` wave ' propagating through a sizeable h - rich envelope , the fairly constant luminosity caused by a balance of ejecta expansion and cooling .",
    "type ii - l sne are usually significantly brighter in peak absolute magnitude than the more common type ii - p @xcite , although they are indicated to simply occupy the bright end of a continuum @xcite .",
    "the short or non - existent plateaus in the light curves of type ii - l sne ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and the lack of a p cygni absorption , are believed to be caused by a relatively low - mass h envelope that simply has a lower column density of absorbing material , and can not sustain the recombination required for a constant luminosity for long @xcite  although @xcite have proposed that the difference is due to @xmath0ni contribution and not the ejecta mass .",
    "these differences and the relative rarity of type ii - l sne red @xmath8 or @xmath9 per cent of all ccsne according to @xcite and @xcite respectively  suggest a relatively high progenitor mass ( a range of 18  23 @xmath10 is favoured by * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn 1979c itself was abnormally bright for a ii - l ( as pointed out by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a luminosity comparable to sn 1998s , possibly as a result of csm interaction . a high mass loss rate for the progenitors of these events is evident from late - time radio observations ( e.g.",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn 1998s remains one of the brightest and most well - studied sne of its class , and has been interpreted as having a red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitor with possibly asymmetric csm consisting of two separate shells , caused by separate mass loss events @xcite ; although the asymmetry of the csm was disputed by @xcite .",
    "strong rsg winds were pointed out as a likely cause for the mass loss .",
    "the subtype iin - l was recently suggested for the several known type iin sne that , like sn 1998s , show similarity to type ii - l @xcite .",
    "the metallicities of the explosion sites of these sne were found to be similar to those of sne",

    "@xcite also raised a question of whether all ii - l sne involve csm interaction , and suggested that if caught early enough , types ii - p , ii - l and iin may be spectroscopically similar .",
    "some transitional events , like sn 2007pk @xcite and ptf11iqb @xcite , were suggested to be somewhere between ii - p and ii(n)-l in terms of progenitor mass and/or mass loss .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of sn 2013fc .",
    "we show that this type ii sn , originally classified as type iin due to host galaxy contamination , closely resembles 1998s - like sne , and is the brightest of these events so far .",
    "we will adopt the term ` 1998s - like ' in this paper to mainly refer to sne 1998s , 1979c and 2008fq , which we will use below as comparison events .",
    "these events were all bright type ii sne that photometrically and spectroscopically resemble type ii - l more than slowly - declining type iin or ii - p and showed signs of csm interaction .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we summarize the observational data ; in section 3 we determine the extinction toward sn 2013fc and describe its host galaxy ; in sections 4 and 5 we present the photometry and spectroscopy of sn 2013fc , respectively ; in section 6 we discuss the nature and favoured progenitor scenario of the sn ; and finally in section 7 we present our conclusions .",
    "sn 2013fc was discovered in the galaxy eso 154-g010 by the chilean automatic supernova search ( chase ; pignata et al .",

    "the location of the sn in its host galaxy is shown in figure 1 .",
    "it was originally classified as a type iin supernova on 2013 august 29 by @xcite based on the detection of strong narrow spectral balmer lines . however , these lines were unresolved in the low - resolution classification spectrum and , based on a sequence of higher - resolution spectra ( see section 3 ) , arose from the host galaxy itself .",
    "thus a better classification of the sn is that of type",
    "ii - l ; see section 4 .",
    "there are no pre - discovery imaging data of eso 154-g010 closer in time to the discovery of the sn than 2013 july 02.3 ut , 48.9 days before discovery . therefore determining the explosion date exactly is not possible .",
    "however , we can make an estimate based on the similarities to the light curves and spectra of other well studied sne .",
    "the supernova identification ( snid ) package @xcite gives a good match between the spectra of sn 2013fc and the bright type ii - l sn 1979c ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "snid also provides a good match between sn 2013fc and sn 1998s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , excluding the narrow component of the h@xmath3 line of sn 2013fc , which we show below to originate from the host galaxy .",
    "the narrow h@xmath3 emission is only prominent in the sn 1998s spectra taken before the brightness maximum ; we also can not exclude the pre - maximum presence of a narrow h@xmath3 emission line in sn 2013fc itself , since all our spectra were taken after the optical - band maximum .",
    "the rise time to maximum for sn 1979c was less than 17 days @xcite , and for sn 1998s roughly 15 days in the _ r _ band @xcite . for sn 2013fc the _ r_-band peak occurred on day 7.2 after its discovery ( jd = 2456531.9 ; see section 4 ) .",
    "considering the spectroscopic and photometric similarities , we assume the _ r_-band rise time to be about 15 days for sn 2013fc as well .",
    "we therefore place the shock breakout roughly eight days before the discovery , on august 12.2 ( jd = 2456516.7 @xmath16 a few days ) , and we adopt this as the 0 day epoch in the rest of this paper .",
    "all epochs of the photometric and spectroscopic observations reported in this paper are in rest - frame days relative to this explosion date .",

    "some redundant epochs have been omitted .",
    "the _ r _ and _ r _ bands , which include the h@xmath3 emission line , have not been included after day 45 , as the strength of the emission disrupts the shape of the continuum ( see section 5 ) . thus ,",
    "for example , from day 17.9 to day 43.7 , we use our _ ubgvrrii _ data , while between days 52.1 and 89.3 we have used _",
    "bgviijhk_. from day 75.6 onwards , one blackbody is no longer sufficient to provide good fits .",
    "therefore , after this we have also fitted a secondary cool component after subtracting a fit to the optical bands .",
    "we tentatively attribute this component to dust emission , as the nir light curves do not decline along with the optical ones .",
    "we show the fits and the fluxes in different bands on days 17.9 , 75.6 and 116.7 in figure 11 .",
    "the blackbody luminosity on day 17.9 , @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 , is @xmath21 per cent higher than the corresponding pseudo - bolometric luminosity due to the inclusion of the uv wavelengths ; estimating the total radiated energy as we did for the pseudo - bolometric light curve , we get @xmath22 erg .",
    "the difference between the blackbody and pseudo - bolometric luminosity decreases over time and becomes negligible at @xmath23 40 days .",
    "the evolution of the blackbody parameters of sn 1998s @xcite is fairly similar to the hot component of our fits .",
    "the difference in radius ( by a factor of @xmath24 ) roughly corresponds to the brightness difference .",
    "the temperature of sn 2013fc is slightly lower than that of sn 1998s at early times , perhaps suggesting a required offset of a few days in our assumption of the explosion date ",
    "the temperatures become consistent when one shifts the epochs of sn 2013fc by @xmath25 days .",
    "the radii of the fits at late times are similar due to the sn 1998s fits only having one component , while the contribution of the cool component of sn 2013fc grows . the radius changes from about 2 @xmath26 cm in the beginning to about @xmath27 cm on day 30 , after which it stays roughly constant until day @xmath28 .",
    "the time when the photospheric radius stays constant approximately corresponds to the short plateau in the light curve .",
    "meanwhile , the temperature of the hot component drops from @xmath2311500 k at day 18 to @xmath237000 k around day 40 , staying around 6000  7000 k until the end of our observations .",
    "this suggests h recombination as a power source in this phase . from day 75",
    "onwards , the blackbody radius starts to shrink and eventually , on day 163 , has reached @xmath29 cm .",
    "the errors of the radius are large throughout , however , and toward the end , the parameters become physically less meaningful as the supernova becomes more nebular .",
    "the temperature of the second component seems to be roughly 2000 k , near the evaporation temperature of amorphous carbon , in all our two - component fits with no significant change from epoch to epoch .",
    "this suggests the existence of roughly 2000-k dust .",
    "the luminosity of this component , although extremely uncertain , seems to be between @xmath30 and @xmath31 per cent of the luminosity of the hot component before day 100 , after which the value seems to decrease , although our _ hk _ magnitudes may become unreliable at this point due to the possible continued presence of the sn in our template images . as the dust",
    "may only form a diluted blackbody or have a low covering factor due to clumpiness , the radii of the cool component are merely lower limits for the true outer extent of the dust .",
    "in order to remove the contamination caused by the host galaxy ( mainly from the h ii / narrow - line region underlying the sn location ) , we have performed template subtractions for the imaging data .",
    "similarly , we subtract the scaled 526 d wifes reference spectrum from the others , assuming that , at this point , the underlying region completely dominates over the sn spectrum .",
    "no spectral features of sn 2013fc can be seen in this spectrum , and the brightness of the sn had at this point faded below the detection threshold . however , the wavelength range of this spectrum is 3500  7300  .",
    "while reducing the efosc2 spectra of days 17 , 27 and 51 , we made extractions with background subtractions both next to the sn and using regions of background sky near the edges of the 2d spectrum .",
    "the difference between these was found to closely correspond to the shape of the 526 d spectrum , and the @xmath32   part was combined with the 526 d spectrum to create the final reference spectrum .",
    "we have scaled the final reference spectrum in such a way that the resulting subtraction provides the best match to the fluxes from the sn photometry after background subtraction .",
    "inevitably , some residual of the narrow lines will remain ; these have been removed from all the spectra in the rest of this paper through interpolation ( this applies to the narrow h@xmath33 , [ o iii ] @xmath34 , [ n ii ] @xmath35 , h@xmath3 and [ s ii]@xmath36 lines ) . additionally , the chip gaps at 4056  4240   and 7315  7490   in the rss spectra have been similarly interpolated over ( 3985  4165   and 7186  7358   in the redshift - corrected spectra ) .",
    "all optical sn spectra from efosc2 , rss and wifes are presented in figure 12 , with the removed narrow lines marked by shaded regions .",
    "the spectra have been dereddened with @xmath37 mag and corrected for redshift @xmath38 , which , as mentioned in section 3 , was measured to be the average redshift of the narrow h@xmath3 line from the underlying cluster that presumably contained the sn .",
    "we thus use this value as the rest frame of the sn .",
    "the evolution of the h@xmath3 line profile can be seen in figure 13 .",
    "the first spectrum in our set is from day 17 . at this point",
    "the spectrum consists of a blue , almost featureless continuum .",
    "the only discernible lines , apart from the na i d absorption caused by the interstellar medium along the line of sight , are shallow h@xmath3 and h@xmath33 absorption profiles .",
    "the h@xmath3 absorption trough has a fwhm of @xmath39 km s@xmath2 and a blueshift of @xmath40 km s@xmath2 ; the blue edge extends to @xmath41 km s@xmath2 , although the shallowness of the absorption compared to the noise makes precise determination of the edge practically impossible .",
    "the h@xmath33 absorption shows similar velocities .",
    "a weak , multi - component si ii @xmath42 absorption feature can be seen , extending to a velocity of @xmath43 km s@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite identify a similar absorption as high - velocity ( hv ) h@xmath3 in the case of sn 2009dd , at a velocity of @xmath44 km s@xmath2 .",
    "such a feature has been predicted by @xcite to appear at velocities as high as @xmath45 km s@xmath2 in the photospheric phase of type ii sne .",
    "if this feature is attributed to h@xmath3 , it corresponds to velocities between @xmath46 and @xmath47 km s@xmath2 , centred on @xmath48 km s@xmath2 ; however , the lack of a clear hv h@xmath33 line supports the line being si ii rather than h@xmath3 .",

    "the early spectra of sn 1979c , however , show the broad but weak h@xmath3 emission and an appearing na i absorption .",
    "the spectra of sne 2007pk and 2008fq ( apart from the narrow h@xmath3 component in sn 2007pk , which is contamination from the host galaxy ) evolve similarly to sn 2013fc but faster .",

    "the h@xmath3 profile of sn 2008fq also shows a similar shape , though with a small absorption trough at @xmath70 km s@xmath2 , and a red wing extending to @xmath717500 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath3 profile of sn 2007pk on day 51 is very similar to these sne as well , and the ca ii nir triplet is of similar shape and strength in the spectra of sne 2013fc , 2008fq and 2007pk .    at later times ,",
    "the ca ii nir triplet becomes more prominent in sne 1998s and 2008fq , but while it is visible on day 89 in sn 2013fc , it stays considerably weaker than in sn 1998s .",

    "conversely , the absorption at the blue edge of the line never disappears from the spectra of sn 2007pk , instead getting stronger toward the later epochs .",
    "the evolution of sn 2013fc from day 83 onwards seems quite different from what happens to sn 1998s at similar epochs , but is probably due to the sn being fainter and the host galaxy contribution to the spectra being relatively stronger at later times , resulting in very noisy subtracted spectra that are susceptible to small changes in the scaling of the reference spectrum .",

    "the asymmetric , blueshifted profile was caused by the receding part of the ejecta being hidden from sight , while the lack of a p cygni absorption was due to the relatively low h envelope mass .",

    ". a mass - loss rate of @xmath84 yr@xmath2 over the last @xmath85 yr was derived from the radio data by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observed evolution of sn 2013fc was similar to these events .",
    "the high peak luminosity , especially that of sne 2013fc and 1979c , could be powered by early ejecta - csm interaction or the ionization of a thick shell of csm by the x - ray / uv flash . as mentioned before ,",
    "the very early narrow lines are not detected , possibly due to a lack of early spectra ; however , the presence of a blue featureless continuum as late as three weeks after the explosion still argues for early csm interaction .",
    "as we show below , we see signs of dust condensing in the cds .",
    "the broad h@xmath3 profile is similar to sne 1998s and 1979c ; we also attribute its shape to opacity effects in the ejecta , possibly with electron scattering contributing to the red wing .",
    "the broad h@xmath3 emission appears gradually , and a similar feature has been seen in multiple 1998s - like sne .",
    "while the multi - layered csm proposed for sn 1998s can be invoked to explain a singular or extremely rare sn , a nearly identical csm structure ( and thus mass - loss history ) may be too much of a coincidence to be common to multiple sne .",
    "a simple @xmath86 csm density profile may be adequate , as was assumed for sn 1979c by e.g. @xcite and argued for sn 1998s by @xcite .    at early times",
    ", the narrow h@xmath3 line would originate in the photoionized , unshocked csm outside the ejecta .",
    "the blue featureless continuum would largely originate from the cds , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "as the ejecta expand , the narrow component would then weaken ; the narrow p cygni profile seen in sn 1998s could be rendered unobservable by the host galaxy contamination . the broad absorption seen in the earliest spectrum",
    "would originate from the ejecta close to the photosphere .",
    "the gradual appearance of the broad h@xmath3 emission may be due to the photosphere receding through the ejecta as it becomes optically thinner , exposing the line - emitting region , until finally the entire region would lie outside the photosphere .",
    "the gradual appearance of the emission in sn 1998s may simply have been missed , while sn 1979c does show signs of this . at the same time",
    "the metal absorption lines ( na , fe , sc ) appear as we begin to see the material deeper inside the ejecta .",
    "the optical light curves of sne 2013fc and 1998s ( and to some degree , other 1998s - like events ) exhibit a very similar , simultaneous short plateau phase roughly at the same time as the broad h@xmath3 emission appears . the plateau of sn 1998s was argued by @xcite to be analogous to the recombination wave in a type ii - p sn , which would place sn 1998s on the ii - p / ii - l continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the same likely applies to sn 2013fc .",
    "the blackbody temperature during the plateau phase in both sn 2013fc and sn 1998s is consistently over 6000 k , even over 7000 k when the phase begins ; however , temperatures like this were also seen at similar times in e.g. the type ii - p sn 2012aw @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of the h@xmath3 emission , @xmath87 erg s@xmath2 on day 50 and @xmath88 erg s@xmath2 in the tail phase at  100 days , is too high to be powered solely by the x - ray luminosity of the reverse shock . as for sn",
    "2008es @xcite we estimate ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the mass loss rate of the wind should be in excess of @xmath89 yr@xmath2 for this to work .",
    "such a wind density would make the supernova look like a bona fide type iin , which is not the case .",
    "however , some powering of the h - alpha could be due to extreme uv photons and soft x - rays produced by inverse compton scattering behind the forward circumstellar shock . as demonstrated by @xcite for sne 1979c and 1980k",
    ", such emission could easily dominate the ionizing radiation for the first months , with a luminosity in excess of a few times @xmath90 erg s@xmath2 after a few weeks , for a mass loss rate of @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath10 yr@xmath2 . at late times , even though inverse compton scattering may contribute , we find it likely that much of the h - alpha emission is due to release of stored shock energy from when the supernova shock traversed an extended envelope .",
    "some bright type ii - l sne , including sne 1998s and 1979c , exhibit a late decline faster than the 0.98 mag ( 100 d)@xmath2 expected from a radioactive tail powered by @xmath0co decay .",
    "the reason for this may be inefficient @xmath66-ray trapping in the sn ejecta . such a scenario was suggested by @xcite , who found that type ii sne with peak _ v _ brightness @xmath93 mag tend to have _ v_-band tail - phase decline rates that are too steep for full @xmath66-ray trapping .",
    "however , the tail phase may in fact be powered by continuing emission from the csm interaction instead of or in addition to @xmath0ni @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the @xmath0ni - powered luminosity could be significantly below the total luminosity .",
    "the @xmath0ni - powered tail of sn 1987a was about four times fainter than the late linearly declining phase of sn 2013fc at an epoch corresponding to the start of the tail in sn 1987a , despite the likely similar mass of the progenitor ( see below ) ; while the tail phase of sn 1979c , for which the presence of ejecta - csm interaction has been invoked , was roughly as bright as that of sn 2013fc .",
    "figure 18 of @xcite shows a correlation in progenitor luminosity vs. apparent @xmath0ni mass , albeit with considerable scatter .",
    "thus we tentatively favour the csm interaction scenario as the explanation of the late - time decline rate ( with perhaps a contribution from diffusion of stored energy produced by the supernova shock when it traversed the extended envelope ) , in which case the @xmath0ni mass estimate should in fact be considered an upper limit . comparing the tail - phase luminosity of sn 2013fc against that of 1987a , we have thus arrived at a @xmath0ni mass limit of @xmath94 . for sn 1998s , @xcite estimated a @xmath0ni mass of @xmath95 , but if this scenario is correct this value should also be taken as an upper limit of @xmath96 .",
    "the presence of hot dust close to the evaporation temperature of amorphous carbon ( 2000 k ) is suggested by our two - component blackbody fits .",
    "the dust radii are larger than those of the hot component , but no clear indication of increasing optical extinction is observed .",
    "thus the covering factor and/or optical thickness are presumably low , possibly due to a clumpy structure . as in the case of sn 1998s",
    ", we see no signature of fast - moving metals in our early spectra . however , the radii of the cool blackbody component are far smaller than the dust evaporation radius we estimate for sn 2013fc .",

    "all in all , our favoured scenario for the dust emission is that of newly condensing dust in the cds , as ( at least ) in the late times of sn 1998s .",
    "it is also possible that the formation of new dust contributes to the decline rates during and after the drop from the plateau phase .",
    "dust would condense close to the evaporation temperature , keeping the temperature of the cool component at @xmath103 k. pre - existing dust in the csm outside the dust evaporation radius may also contribute , but in the _ jhk _ bands , hot newly - condensed dust probably dominates the emission .",
    "in addition to sn 1998s @xcite , a late - time nir excess has been attributed to emission from newly - condensed dust in the cds at least in the case of the type ii - p sn 2007od @xcite .",
    "newly - formed cds dust has also been suggested as the origin of the nir excess in the case of the type ibn sn 2006jc @xcite as early as 55 days after explosion .",
    "attenuation of the red wing of the h@xmath3 profile and the steepening of the optical light curve were observed e.g. in two 1988z - like sne 2005ip and 2006jd with an early nir excess and attributed to warm , newly - formed @xmath104 k dust by @xcite .",
    "if the dust is condensing in the cds , it is another sign of csm interaction , as dust condensation in the ejecta has typically been observed at much later epochs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "considering the late - time flattening of the nir light curve , the late - time shrinking of the dust blackbody radius and the constant dust temperature may not be real physical effects but results of the sn still contributing to the _ hk _ templates .",
    "however , this would mean that the nir emission continued at roughly the same brightness between days @xmath105 and @xmath106 , unlike sn 1998s which declined in all nir bands at corresponding times .",
    "the similarities between the 1979c/1998s - like sne described in this paper point to them having similar progenitors as well .",
    "the progenitor masses of these events can be estimated by various means .",
    "@xcite used padova stellar models to constrain the progenitor of sn 1979c based on the clusters surrounding it , using deep _",
    "hubble space telescope _ imaging .",
    "they arrived at an age estimate of @xmath23 10 myr and a progenitor mass of @xmath107 ",
    "18 @xmath10 , consistently with the @xmath108 suggested by @xcite based on mass loss estimates .",
    "the he core of the progenitor of sn 1998s was estimated by @xcite to be comparable to that of 1987a , which had a @xmath2320 @xmath10 blue supergiant ( bsg ) progenitor . the core mass was estimated based on model fitting to co first - overtone emission .",
    "furthermore , the similarity to ii - l sne may indicate progenitor masses comparable to the 15  18 @xmath10 suggested for ii - l by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also suggested @xmath109 rsg progenitors for type ii - l sne .",
    "we have also made a very rough assessment of the progenitor mass of sn 2013fc by fitting stellar populations to the location of the sn .",
    "the high extinction at the star - forming region at this location gives a reasonable match to an extinction estimated through a comparison with sn 1998s which , together with the unchanging profile of the na i d absorption , implies that sn 2013fc was indeed inside this region .",
    "the age estimate of the young population , as in the case of sn 1979c , is @xmath5 myr .",
    "we would assume that the progenitor of the sn was the most massive star of this population , if the stars are coeval .",
    "this corresponds to an initial mass of @xmath110 , assuming solar metallicity and according to the padova 1994 model tracks @xcite .",
    "thus the star could have been a massive rsg ( or perhaps a bsg ) with strong mass loss in the form of a dense wind close to the end of its life .",
    "an example of a star such as this would be the red hypergiant vy canis majoris ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a progenitor mass in this range is roughly consistent with that of the progenitors of sne 1979c and 1998s , as discussed above .",

    "the light curve exhibits an initial linear decline followed by a short plateau phase , visible in the _ vrriij _ bands , and a brightness drop to a tail - like phase where the decline rate is too high for @xmath0co decay .",
    "the spectra show a nearly featureless blue continuum some three weeks after explosion , followed by the appearance of a strong , asymmetric , broad ( fwhm @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) h@xmath3 emission without a p cygni profile .",
    "we tentatively identify a h@xmath3 absorption around @xmath112 km s@xmath2 .",
    "a strong nir emission likely originates in hot dust condensing in the cds that forms at the ejecta - csm discontinuity .",
    "these features indicate interaction between the ejecta and the csm and a low h envelope mass at the time of explosion , although the presence of early narrow lines can not be verified , as no pre - maximum spectra of sn 2013fc exist ( which is also the case with sn 1979c ) .",
    "sn 2013fc had a peak _ b _ magnitude of @xmath113 ; it was 0.9 mag brighter than sn 1998s in the optical , while sn 1979c had a comparable peak brightness . we suggest that a simple @xmath86 density profile of the csm may be sufficient to explain the observed features of sn 2013fc ; this was argued for sn 1998s as well in the latest analyses .",
    "if csm interaction was present , sn 2013fc ( like sn 1979c ) is likely to be still observable in radio a few years after explosion .",
    "based on the photometry , we construct a pseudo - bolometric light curve and estimate a total radiated energy of @xmath79 erg until day 163 ; @xmath80 times higher that radiated by normal type ii - p sne , but a factor of at least a few lower than that of bright slowly declining 1988z - like type iin sne .",

    "massive rsgs have been suggested as progenitors of 1998s - like sne ; the strong winds of the rsg would then cause the presence of the csm .",

    "<S> we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2013fc , a bright type ii supernova ( sn ) in a circumnuclear star - forming ring in the luminous infrared galaxy eso 154-g010 , observed as part of the public eso spectroscopic survey of transient objects ( pessto ) . </S>",
    "<S> sn 2013fc is both photometrically and spectroscopically similar to the well - studied type iin sn 1998s and to the bright type ii - l sn 1979c . </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits an initial linear decline , followed by a short plateau phase and a tail phase with a decline too fast for @xmath0co decay with full gamma - ray trapping . </S>",
    "<S> initially the spectrum was blue and featureless . </S>",
    "<S> later on , a strong broad ( @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) h@xmath3 emission profile became prominent . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a starlight stellar population model fit to the sn location ( observed when the sn had faded ) to estimate a high extinction of @xmath4 mag and an age of @xmath5 myr for the underlying cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the sn to sne 1998s and 1979c and discuss its possible progenitor star considering the similarities to these events . with a peak brightness of @xmath6 mag , </S>",
    "<S> sn 2013fc is 0.9 mag brighter than sn 1998s and of comparable brightness to sn 1979c . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that sn 2013fc was consistent with a massive red supergiant ( rsg ) progenitor . </S>",
    "<S> recent mass loss probably due to a strong rsg wind created the circumstellar matter illuminated through its interaction with the sn ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a near - infrared excess , possibly due to newly condensed dust .    </S>",
