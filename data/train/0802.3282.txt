    "the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected to be formed in high energy collisions of nuclei when the energy density is large enough .",
    "as the plasma expands it cools down and undergoes a phase transition to ordinary hadrons .",
    "different observables have been suggested to provide a signal for the existence of the plasma .",
    "one of the most promising signals , that can also reveal detailed information on the properties of the qgp , appears at present to be jet quenching , i.e. the energy loss of an energetic quark or gluon traversing the plasma resulting in a jet of hadrons , or single hadrons , with reduced energy @xcite .",
    "thus , one may consider a normal hard qcd parton - parton scattering event to take place in the environment of the qgp which has been produced in the nucleus - nucleus collision .",
    "the qgp acts as a background with which the hard - scattered partons may interact .",
    "such jet quenching phenomena have indeed been observed at rhic @xcite , but it remains to be demonstrated that they are really caused by a qgp .",
    "this requires a better understanding of the qcd processes involved and this paper contributes to this .",
    "once a proper framework has been established , one can use the modified jet properties as a trustworthy signal to claim discovery of the qgp , and also as a tool to study its properties .    until recently ,",
    "theoretical efforts have concentrated on medium - induced gluon bremsstrahlung as the dominant energy loss mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , collisional energy loss caused by multiple scatterings in the medium has also been considered @xcite and demonstrated @xcite to contribute significantly to the jet quenching effect observed at rhic .",
    "although these scatterings occur over the few - fermi extended plasma , they overlap in time with normal perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) gluon radiation ( the parton cascade ) which is time dilated in the qgp rest frame .",
    "therefore , such radiation and interactions with the plasma must be treated in a common framework .",
    "this is the objective of this paper .",
    "the energy available at rhic limits the transverse momentum of the hard - scattered parton such that one mainly observes single high @xmath0 hadrons , rather than complete jets . with heavy ion collisions in lhc , however , the energy is substantially larger and should give access to the study of jets and how their properties are affected by the underlying interaction with the plasma .",
    "the larger momentum transfer should also establish a safer ground for a perturbative qcd treatment .    in section [ sec - basics ] , we introduce scattering with the plasma into the familiar jet evolution dglap equation @xcite . in this way",
    "the scattering can be solved numerically without further approximations and this evolution equation provides a basis for development of a modified parton shower monte carlo algorithm @xcite . in section [ sec - transverse ] , we start from a more general evolution equation taking also the transverse momentum into account and introduce the scattering .",
    "we show how this modifies the evolution for the dominant small momentum transfer scatterings . using appropriate approximations ,",
    "we obtain a medium - modified evolution equation which is suitable for analytical investigations .",
    "we also show that by integrating out the transverse momentum dependence the medium - modified dglap equations of section [ sec - basics ] is recovered . in section [ sec - numerical ]",
    ", both approaches are used to obtain numerical results on how the fragmentation functions are affected by this jet quenching mechanism .",
    "section [ sec - conclusions ] concludes with a discussion of our results .",
    "a quark or gluon that emerges from a hard scattering can be virtual ( @xmath1 ) and therefore it will radiate successively to reduce its virtuality and become on mass - shell .",
    "this leads to a parton shower and scaling violations in the jet fragmentation functions as described by the dglap equations @xcite and other more sophisticated evolution equations @xcite .",
    "the formation of this parton shower does not happen instantaneously , but needs a certain time . in the lab frame ,",
    "i.e.  in the rest frame of the nucleus - nucleus collision and the plasma , the lifetime of a virtual parton can be estimated from the uncertainty principle to be @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the parton s energy and @xmath4 its virtual mass . in the case of a parton shower , however , the relevant time is the time a virtual state needs to evolve in virtuality from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , @xmath6 the time a parton needs to reduce its virtuality from the starting scale @xmath7 to the hadronisation scale @xmath8 gev can then be estimated as @xmath9 .",
    "thus , even though a high energy parton with large virtuality will reduce its virtuality rapidly , the overall lifetime can be considerable and of the order @xmath10 or several fermi .",
    "the formation time @xmath11 of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite is estimated to be of the order 0.2 fm at rhic and likely less than 0.1 fm at lhc , but the plasma lifetime @xmath12 may be long due to the cooling from the initial temperature to the critical temperature . taking into account these two time scales of the parton and the surrounding medium we arrive at the conclusion that the parton shower evolution overlaps in time with the plasma phase . therefore , energy loss through radiation and scattering has to be treated together in a common framework .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of a parton cascade that includes scattering off the partons in the qgp as a modification to the well known qcd evolution in vacuum .",
    "this is achieved by adding a scattering term in the dglap equations .",
    "modified dglap evolution equations due to medium - induced radiation has been considered in @xcite for the qgp and for deep inelastic scattering off nuclei in @xcite .",
    "the literature on jet quenching in the qgp also deals with effects like energy loss of on - shell and off - shell partons and modified hadronisation at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "our approach differs from these by explicitly handling off - shell partons and the evolution of the shower in the presence of the medium .",
    "we assume here that the hadronisation at the infrared cut - off scale @xmath13 is unchanged and use standard vacuum fragmentation functions , since the plasma is essentially gone by the time the parton has evolved down to this low virtuality .",
    "furthermore , we are here primarily interested in the high-@xmath0 particles that stand out from the underlying background of hadrons from the hadronisation of the plasma and such higher energy hadrons have a longer formation time in the lab frame due to their larger lorentz @xmath14 factor . in this and the next section",
    "we concentrate on developing the formalism for the evolution at the parton level and thereafter add on hadronisation through a well established parametrisation .",
    "let us consider a hard process where a parton with high virtuality and high energy is produced .",
    "due to parton splitting and parton scattering a parton shower emerges from this source .",
    "we define the fragmentation function @xmath15 as the probability density for the hard parton @xmath16 with virtuality @xmath17 to fragment into a parton or hadron @xmath18 which takes a fraction @xmath19 of the initial parton energy . in this first study",
    "we restrict our parton level treatment to a purely gluonic system , which should give the dominating behaviour and most essential results .",
    "the indices on the fragmentation functions can then be dropped and the formalism becomes simplified also in other aspects .    in the shower evolution ,",
    "an arbitrary intermediate gluon with a fraction @xmath20 of the original energy @xmath3 loses a fraction @xmath21 through radiation or scattering , and becomes an outgoing gluon with energy @xmath22 .",
    "the parton cascade occurs through the normal splitting process @xmath23 with differential probability @xmath24 which is of first order in @xmath25 and written in terms of the unregularised splitting function @xmath26\\ ] ] the scattering process @xmath27 is similarly given by the differential probability @xmath28 as the product of the scattering cross - section , the density of target gluons in the plasma and the time ( or equivalently distance ) the gluon traverses the plasma .",
    "we introduce the scattering function @xmath29 in analogy with the splitting function to combine gluon splittings and gluon scatterings in a generalized dglap equation for the qcd evolution of a jet in the plasma medium @xmath30 where in the first line @xmath31 , i.e.  the intermediate energy fraction @xmath20 is integrated out via @xmath32 . the negative contribution in the second line",
    "is present when using the unregularized splitting function instead of the regularized one with the plus prescription @xcite .",
    "this formulation gives a clear physical interpretation , namely that the first line in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) gives the _ gain _ of a gluon at @xmath19 which was at @xmath33 before the splitting or scattering , and the second line gives the _ loss _ of a gluon with energy @xmath34 before the splitting or scattering .",
    "we also note that the two loss terms can be thought of as ensuring that probability is conserved . for the splitting loss term it leads after integration of the dglap equation to the so - called sudakov factor , whereas from the scattering loss term one gets a factor @xmath35 corresponding to the attenuation of a beam .    to obtain the scattering function @xmath29",
    ", we develop the different parts of eq . ( [ p - scat ] ) . for the @xmath36 scattering cross section we use the leading order pqcd formula @xmath37 which has been regularized by the debye mass @xmath38 of the plasma gluons which screens the interaction such that this expression can be applied down to @xmath39 .",

    "we neglect the motion of the scattering centers , which is a good approximation at large jet energies , i.e.  @xmath51 . for small @xmath19",
    "this is not necessarily the case , but in this region the dglap equations should also be improved by soft gluon resummation for an accurate description of the shower evolution .",

    "the parton transverse momenta can be explicitly taken into account in the jet evolution .",
    "such an evolution equation in the vacuum was first derived in leading logarithmic approximation in ref .",
    "recently two papers @xcite have appeared which apply the same framework of transverse - momentum - dependent qcd evolution equations to deep inelastic scattering . here",
    "we generalize this to the case of jet evolution in the quark - gluon plasma by introducing scatterings as in the previous section .",
    "transverse momentum of the tagged parton is an important tool to diagnose the history of the parton in the medium . in deep inelastic scattering in nuclei",

    "nevertheless , our approximation with a stationary plasma in the numerical solution of the evolution equations is reasonable to illustrate the magnitude of jet quenching effect . to see this one has to consider the time needed for a parton shower to evolve down to @xmath13",

    ", it seems clear that although the overall behaviour is in agreement with the observed one , the magnitude is smaller than observed at rhic .",
    "this leaves room for the expected additional medium - induced radiation @xcite .    for rhic conditions , with initial parton energy @xmath139 , the jet quenching effect obtained here does not vary strongly with this energy but",
    "depends essentially only on the momentum fraction .",
    "this gives a quenching effect which is essentially independent of the transverse momentum of the hadrons and thereby a nuclear modification factor @xmath140 which is flat over a substantial @xmath0-interval , just as observed in the rhic data .    for heavy ion collisions at lhc",
    "we find a substantially increased jet quenching effect at higher jet energies due to the increased range of allowed momentum transfers , an increased evolution path in @xmath141 , the longer lifetime of the parton as well as of the plasma , and enhanced scattering probability .",
    "multiple scatterings may then add up many relatively small energy losses to a substantial effect .",
    "thus , we expect , e.g. , the nuclear modification factor @xmath140 to be further reduced at the higher @xmath0 available at lhc .",
    "a comparison of jet profiles of heavy quarks with gluon jets may help to fix the form of the plasma scattering cross section more precisely .",
    "since the momentum transfers extend to low momenta @xmath142 , a purely perturbative calculation of the cross section may be questionable and an improved treatment needed @xcite . especially one has to study further how the temperature scale @xmath47 can modify the leading @xmath143 behaviour .",
    "a recent calculation of jet evolution in the modified leading log approximation @xcite has produced differential multiplicity distributions .",
    "the advantage of our calculation is that it takes into account the scattering term explicitly and therefore gives results which depend on the plasma density and temperature .",
    "taking transverse momentum into account explicitly as an extra variable , the equation could in principle be used to investigate the @xmath106 broadening of the parton in the medium , which is highly relevant for the size of the jet cone in nucleus - nucleus collisions and will be studied further .",
    "another issue to be studied is whether the plasma affects the non - perturbative hadronisation processes and thereby changes the fragmentation function .",
    "this may depend on whether partons are first forming preconfined states @xcite , as is theoretically supported e.g.  in the large @xmath144 approximation , or directly form hadrons ( including resonances ) .",
    "intermediate prehadrons below the scale @xmath13 may suffer more scatterings than final hadrons and thereby modify the hadronic spectra of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the non - perturbative phase after evolution down to @xmath145 gev should be relatively more important at the lower energy scale of rhic . at lhc ,",
    "the larger energy implies that the formation of prehadrons and hadrons occurs later in lab frame , in particular for leading hadrons with a large lorentz @xmath14 factor .",
    "we therefore expect that medium - modified hadronisation effects should be less and thereby our theoretical approach closer to reality .    to conclude , we have developed a formalism to account for energy losses due to scattering in a plasma . with the indicated further developments",
    "this should facilitate systematic comparisons with the observed jet quenching in heavy ion collisions , which should contribute to a demonstration of the existence of the quark - gluon plasma and an exploration of its properties .",

    "<S> the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) can be explored in relativistic heavy ion collisions by the jet quenching signature , i.e. by the energy loss of a high energy quark or gluon traversing the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a novel qcd evolution formalism in the leading logarithm approximation , where normal parton radiation is interleaved with scattering on the plasma gluons occuring at a similar time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is elaborated in two approaches . </S>",
    "<S> one extends the dglap evolution equations for fragmentation functions to include scatterings in the medium , which facilitates numerical solutions for comparison with data and provides a basis for a monte carlo implementation . </S>",
    "<S> the other approach is more general by including also the transverse momentum dependence of the jet evolution , which allows a separation of the scales also for the scattering term and provides a basis for analytical investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the two approaches are shown to be related and give the same characteristic softening of the jet depending on the temperature of the plasma . </S>",
    "<S> a substantial effect is found at the rhic energy and is further enhanced at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> systematic studies of data on the energy loss could , therefore , demonstrate the existence of the qgp and probe its properties . </S>"
