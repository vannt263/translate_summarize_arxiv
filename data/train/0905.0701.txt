    "when studying the collective dynamics of cortical neurons computationally , networks of large numbers of spiking neurons have naturally been the benchmark model .",
    "network models incorporate the most fundamental physiological properties of neurons : sub - threshold voltage dynamics , spiking ( via spike generation dynamics or a fixed threshold ) , and discontinuous synaptic interactions . for this reason ,",
    "networks of spiking neurons are considered to be biologically realistic . however , with few exceptions , e.g. @xcite , network models of spiking neurons are not amenable to analytical work and thus constitute above all a computational tool .",
    "rather , researchers use reduced or simplified models which describe some measure of the mean activity in a population of cells , oftentimes taken as the firing rate .",
    "firing - rate models are simple , phenomenological models of neuronal activity , generally in the form of continuous , first - order ordinary differential equations @xcite . such firing - rate models can be analyzed using standard techniques for differential equations , allowing one to understand the qualitative dependence of the dynamics on parameters .",
    "nonetheless , firing - rate models do not represent , in general , proper mathematical reductions of the original network dynamics but rather are heuristic , but see @xcite .",
    "as such , there is in general no clear relationship between the parameters in the rate model and those in the full network of spiking neurons , although for at least some specific cases quasi - analytical approaches may be of value @xcite .",
    "it therefore behooves the researcher to study rate models in conjunction with network simulations in order to ensure there is good qualitative agreement between the two .",
    "luckily , rate models have proven remarkably accurate in capturing the main types of qualitative dynamical states seen in networks of large numbers of asynchronously spiking neurons .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite that the addition of an explicit delay in a rate equation was sufficient to describe the emergence of fast oscillations prevalent in networks of spiking neurons with dominant inhibition . in such networks , effective delays due to the continuous synaptic kinetics can lead to oscillations even in the absence of any explicit delay in the neuronal interactions .",
    "when the pattern of synaptic connectivity depends on the distance between neurons , then this effective delay can also lead to the emergence of waves .",
    "this is certainly a relevant case for local circuits in cortical tissue , where the likelihood of finding a connection between any two neurons decreases as a function of the distance between them , e.g. @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied a rate model with fixed delay on a ring geometry with two simplifying assumptions .",
    "first they assumed that the strength of connection between neurons could be expressed as a constant plus the cosine of the distance between the neurons .",
    "secondly , they assumed a linear rectified form for the transfer function which relates inputs to outputs .",
    "these assumptions allowed them to construct a detailed phase diagram of dynamical states , to a large degree analytically .",
    "in addition to the stationary bump state ( sb ) which had been studied previously @xcite , the presence of a delay led to two new states arising from primary instabilities of the stationary uniform state ( su ) : an oscillatory uniform state ( ou ) and a traveling wave state ( tw ) .",
    "secondary bifurcations of these three states ( sb , ou , tw ) led to yet more complex states including standing waves ( sw ) and oscillatory bump states ( ob ) .",
    "several regions of bistability between primary and secondary states were found , including ou - tw , ou - sb and ou - ob .",
    "they subsequently confirmed these results through simulations of networks of hodgkin - huxley neurons . despite the good agreement between the rate equation and network simulations",
    ", two main issues remain unresolved .",
    "* the rate equation predicted that the primary instability of the su state to waves should be to traveling waves , while in the network simulations standing waves were robustly observed . * the linear - threshold transfer function ,",
    "albeit amenable to analysis , nonetheless leads to degenerate behavior at a bifurcation point .",
    "specifically , any perturbations with a positive linear growth rate will continue to grow until the lower threshold of the transfer function is reached .",
    "this means that the amplitude of new solution branches at a bifurcation is always finite , although the solution itself may not be subcritical . in a practical sense",
    "then , this means that it is not possible to assess whether a particular solution , for example oscillations or bumps , will emerge continuously from the su state as a parameter is changed , or if it will appear at finite amplitude and therefore be bistable with the su state over some range .    in order to address these issues , and provide a more complete analysis of the role of fixed delays in neuronal tissue , we here study a rate equation with delay without imposing any restrictions on the form of the transfer function beyond smoothness or on the shape of the connectivity kernel beyond being symmetric .",
    "what we show is that the nature and stability of the solutions arising via primary instabilities of the su state ( oscillations , bumps and waves ) depend on nonlinear combinations of the first three derivatives of the transfer function and the first three spatial fourier coefficients of the connectivity kernel .",
    "thus while the presence of a fixed delay alone is sufficient to generate oscillations and waves , whether the oscillations are bistable with the unpatterned state and which type of waves ( standing waves or traveling waves ) , appear as a stable solution , depend crucially on the transfer function and pattern of synaptic connectivity . we will discuss this in great depth in the results section .",
    "we would like to emphasize the fact that we are interested in the effect of a _ fixed _",
    "delay on the dynamics of a local patch of cortical tissue .",
    "in fact , delays in the nervous system are most often associated with transmission delays , i.e. delays due to the finite velocity propagation of action potentials along axons .",
    "indeed , this type of propagation delay , which depends linearly on the distance between any two neurons , has been the topic of much theoretical study , e.g. @xcite .",
    "localized solutions of integro - differential equations describing neuronal activity , including fronts and pulses , are affected by distance - dependent axonal delays @xcite . specifically , the velocity of propagation of the localized solution is proportional to the conduction velocity along the axon for small conduction velocities , while for large conduction velocities it is essentially constant .",
    "this reflects the fact that the propagation of activity in neuronal tissue is driven by local integration in which synaptic and membrane time constants provide the bottleneck . also , allowing for different conduction velocities for separate excitatory and inhibitory populations can lead to bifurcations of localized bump states to breathers and traveling pulses @xcite .",
    "pattern - forming instabilities have also been studied in the presence of distance - dependent delays .",
    "the presence of propagation delays in rate models can lead to oscillations and waves @xcite .",
    "the weakly nonlinear dynamics of waves in spatially extended rate models , i.e. describing large - scale ( on the order of centimeters ) activity , is described by the coupled mean - field ginzburg - landau equations @xcite , and thus exhibits the phenomenology of small amplitude waves familiar from other pattern forming systems @xcite .    on the other hand , fixed delays , and their effect on the dynamics of large numbers of recurrently coupled neurons ,",
    "have received relatively little theoretical attention .",
    "some exceptions include work on the role of global feedback delay in shaping the power spectrum of a network driven by noisy inputs @xcite , and the effect of distributed delays in a mean - field corticothalamic model @xcite .",
    "more akin to the work we present here is the recent study of the effect of two distinct delays in a spatially homogeneous wilson - cowan model @xcite .",
    "there the authors were able to compute oscillatory solutions analytically given a heaviside transfer function of the rate variables .",
    "more generally , fixed delays , which are likely due to synaptic and dendritic integration , and conduction delays due to the propagation of action potentials along the axon , are both present in real neuronal systems .",
    "importantly , this means that the delay in neuronal interactions at zero distance is not zero .",
    "in fact , _ fixed _ delays are always observed in paired intracellular recordings in cortical slices .",
    "the latency from the start of the fast rising phase of the action potential to the start of the post - synaptic current ( or potential ) has been measured for pairs of pyramidal cells in rat layers 3 to 6 and is on the order of milliseconds , see @xcite for a recent review .",
    "recordings from cat cortex and between pyramidal cells and other cells including spiny cells and interneurons in the rat cortex also reveal fixed delays which are rarely less than a millisecond .",
    "these delays are seen when neurons are spatially adjacent , indicating that axonal propagation is not an important contributing factor . on the other hand",
    "the speed of propagation of action potentials along unmyelinated axons in mammals is on the order of @xmath0 m / s , which means a delay of 0.1 - 10 ms for neurons separated by 1 millimeter @xcite .",
    "thus fixed delays and conduction delays are of similar magnitude within a local patch of cortex and both would be expected to shape the dynamics of non - steady activity , i.e. neither is negligible .",
    "here we have decided to focus on fixed delays , as in previous work @xcite , due both to their physiological relevance and prevalence in networks of spiking neurons .",
    "thus in what follows we will study a rate equation with fixed delay and spatially modulated connectivity . in section [ model ] we formulate the model and conduct a linear stability analysis of the su state . in section",
    "[ sect : codim1 ] we conduct a weakly nonlinear analysis for the four possible primary instabilities of the su state ( asynchronous unpatterned state in a network model ) , thereby deriving amplitude equations for a steady , turing ( bumps ) , hopf ( global oscillations ) , and turing - hopf ( waves ) bifurcations .",
    "we will focus on the delay - driven instabilities , i.e. hopf and turing - hopf . finally , in section [ sect : codim2 ] we will study the interactions of pairs of solutions : bumps and global oscillations and global oscillations and waves respectively .",
    "we study a heuristic equation describing the activity of a small patch of neural tissue consisting of two populations of recurrently coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons respectively .",
    "our formulation is equivalent to the wilson - cowan equations without refractory period @xcite , and with spatially dependent synaptic connectivity which was studied originally in @xcite .",
    "additionally , we consider a fixed delay in the neuronal interactions . given these assumptions , the full wilson - cowan equations are    @xmath1    in the original formulation @xcite , @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent the average number of active cells in the excitatory and inhibitory populations respectively , in this case at a position @xmath4 and at a time @xmath5 .",
    "the time constant @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is roughly the time it takes for a an excitatory ( inhibitory ) cell receiving `` at least threshold excitation '' @xcite to generate a spike .",
    "this can reasonably be taken as the membrane time constant which is generally on the order of 10 - 20 ms .",
    "the functions @xmath8 are usually taken to be sigmoidal . specifically ,",
    "if all neurons in the population receive equal excitatory drive , and there is heterogeneity in some parameter across neurons , e.g. the threshold to spiking , which obeys a unimodal distribution , then the fraction of active neurons is just the integral over the distribution , up to the given level of excitation .",
    "the integral of a unimodal distribution is sigmoidal . in eqs.[eq : wc_e]-[eq : wc_i ] , the functions @xmath9 represent the strength of synaptic connection from a neuron in population @xmath10 to a neuron in population @xmath11 separated by a distance @xmath4 . here",
    "the neurons are arranged in one dimension on a domain @xmath12 .",
    "input from excitatory ( inhibitory ) cells is furthermore delayed by a fixed amount @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , which , as we have discussed in the introduction , is on the order of one millisecond .",
    "finally , the excitatory and inhibitory populations are subject to an external drive of strength @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .    a general analysis of eqs.[eq : wc_e]-[eq : wc_i ]",
    "would be technically arduous although it is a natural extension of the work presented here .",
    "rather , we choose to study the dynamics of this system under the simplifying assumption that the excitatory and inhibitory neurons follow the same dynamics , i.e. @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "if this the case , then @xmath23 and the variable @xmath24 follows the dynamics given by @xmath25 where we have chosen the domain @xmath26 to be a ring of normalized length @xmath27 . furthermore , we have re - scaled time by the time constant @xmath28 .",
    "the normalized delay is therefore @xmath29 , which is the ratio of the effective delay in neuronal interactions to the integration time constant and should be much less than one in general .",
    "the synaptic connectivity expressed in terms of the excitatory and inhibitory contributions is @xmath30 and thus represents an effective mixed coupling which may have both positive and negative regions .",
    "eq.[eq : rate ] with the choice of @xmath31 for @xmath32 and 0 otherwise and with @xmath33 is precisely the model studied in @xcite .",
    "we now wish to study eq.[eq : rate ] for arbitrary choices of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in presenting eq.[eq : rate ]",
    "we have relied on the heuristic physiological motivation first put forth in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , as a phenomenological model , the terms and parameters in eq.[eq : rate ] may have alternative and equally plausible interpretations .",
    "indeed , the variable @xmath24 is often thought of as the firing rate as opposed to the fraction of active cells , in which case the function @xmath36 can be thought of as the transfer function or fi curve of a cell .",
    "experimentally this function has been found to be well approximated by a power - law nonlinearity with a power greater than one @xcite .",
    "modeling studies show that the same nonlinearity applies to integrate - and - fire neurons and conductance based neurons driven by noisy inputs @xcite .",
    "therefore it may be that such a choice of @xmath37 leads to better agreement of eq.[eq : rate ] with networks of spiking neurons and hence with actual neuronal activity .",
    "more fundamentally , we may ask if choosing @xmath38 as a sigmoid or a power law qualitatively alters the dynamical states arising in eq.[eq : rate ] . this is precisely why we choose here not to impose restrictions on @xmath38 but rather conduct an analysis valid for any @xmath38 . how the choice of @xmath38 affects the generation of oscillations and waves is an issue we will return to in the corresponding sections of this paper .",
    "stationary uniform solutions ( su ) of eq.[eq : rate ] are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant non - zero rate , @xmath41 is the zeroth order spatial fourier coefficient of the symmetric connectivity which can be expressed as @xmath42 and @xmath43 is an integer .",
    "depending on the form of @xmath38 , eq.[eq : ss ] may admit one or several solutions .",
    "we study the linear stability of the su state with the ansatz @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the spatial wavenumber @xmath43 is an integer due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "plugging eq.[eq : ansatz ] into eq.[eq : rate ] leads to an equation for the complex eigenvalue @xmath46 @xmath47 where the slope @xmath48 is evaluated at the fixed point given by eq.[eq : ss ] .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalue @xmath49 represent the linear growth rate and frequency of perturbations with spatial wavenumber @xmath43 respectively . at the bifurcation of a single mode",
    ", the growth rate will reach zero at exactly one point and be negative elsewhere .",
    "that is , @xmath50 for the critical mode @xmath51 .",
    "given this , eq.[eq : growth ] yields the dispersion relation for the frequency of oscillation of the critical mode @xmath52 from eq.[eq : disp ] it is clear that the wavelength of the critical mode depends crucially on the synaptic connectivity .",
    "in particular , the spatial fourier coefficients of the connectivity kernel @xmath35 depend on the wavenumber @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the critical wavenumber is , in effect , selected by the choice of connectivity kernel .",
    "it is in this way that the nature of the instability depends on the synaptic connectivity at the linear level .",
    "depending on the values of @xmath54 and @xmath51 in eq.[eq : disp ] at the bifurcation from the su state , four types of instabilities are possible :    * steady ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) : the instability leads to a global increase in activity . *",
    "turing ( @xmath55 , @xmath57 ) : the instability leads to a stationary bump state .",
    "* hopf ( @xmath58 , @xmath56 ) : the instability leads to an oscillatory uniform state . * turing - hopf ( @xmath58,@xmath57 ) : the instability leads to waves .    for the non - oscillatory instabilities ( i.e. @xmath59 ) , eq.[eq : disp ] gives the critical value @xmath60 while for the oscillatory ones eq.[eq : disp ] is equivalent to the system of two transcendental equations    @xmath61    @xmath62    note that we have defined the critical values as @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "as fixed delays are on the order of a few milliseconds and the integration time constant is about an order of magnitude larger , the limit of @xmath65 is a relevant one physiologically .",
    "this allows us to gain some intuition regarding the effect of fixed delays on the dynamics by deriving asymptotic results in the limit of small delay .",
    "therefore throughout this work we will present asymptotic results , and compare them to the full analytical formulas , as well as numerical simulations . in the limit of small delay @xmath65",
    ", it can be easily shown that an instability of the @xmath66 spatial fourier mode occurs at the critical value of the coupling @xmath67 with a frequency @xmath68 fig.[fig : disp ] shows the critical frequency and coupling as a function of the delay , up to a delay of @xmath69 .",

    "we will set the higher order coefficients to zero for this particular phase diagram , although we will discuss the effect of additional modes in the text .",

    "this tw branch most likely arises in a secondary bifurcation slightly below the turing - hopf bifurcation line .",
    "there is also a small region of bistability between large amplitude tw and the spatially uniform high activity state ( tw / ha in the phase diagram fig.[fig : diagram ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have studied the nature and stability of solutions arising via a primary instability of a fixed point in a rate equation with fixed delay , eq.[eq : rate ] .",
    "the four possible primary instabilities are : i. - a steady rate instability for sufficiently strong recurrent excitation which leads to a high activity state , ii . - a turing instability for mexican hat connectivity which leads to stationary bumps , iii . - a hopf instability for sufficiently strong recurrent inhibition which leads to an oscillatory uniform state , iv . - a turing - hopf instability for strong local inhibition and longer - range excitation ( inverted mexican hat ) which leads to waves .",
    "we have focused on the oscillatory instabilities which arise only for a non - zero delay , i.e. they are delay - driven .",
    "the instability mechanism due to the delay can be understood intuitively .",
    "we need only assume that the coupling in the system is predominantly inhibitory and that there is a fixed delay @xmath71 in the interactions between neurons . in this case , if the state of the system is perturbed at a time @xmath5 , causing an increase in activity , then this increase in activity will generate a corresponding decrease in activity after a time @xmath159 .",
    "this decrease in activity leads to an increase in activity again after a time @xmath159 . in this way",
    "oscillations can emerge .",
    "this argument does not tell us how strong the inhibition must be to maintain oscillations , and this will depend on the details of the system .",
    "additionally it is clear that this mechanism is only valid for inhibitory and not excitatory feedback .",
    "an equation of the form eq.[eq : rate ] with a threshold linear transfer function and cosine connectivity was studied already in @xcite .",
    "the simple choice of transfer function and connectivity allowed the authors to construct a phase diagram of dynamical states to a large extent analytically .",
    "many of the dynamical states predicted by this analysis were subsequently confirmed through simulations of recurrently coupled spiking neurons @xcite .",
    "one discrepancy concerned the turing - hopf instability which in the rate equation lead to traveling waves ( tw ) and in the network simulations to standing waves ( sw ) .",
    "here we have shown that including a transfer function with an expansive nonlinearity in the rate equation correctly predicts a sw state given a simple cosine connectivity .",
    "we additionally predicted that a tw state should be seen once a sufficiently large and negative second spatial fourier mode was included in the connectivity .",
    "this was borne out in network simulations of hodgkin - huxley neurons , see fig.[fig : rasters ] .",
    "this explains the discrepancy in the previous work but , in fact , makes the much more general point that the specific form of the transfer function ( or fi curve ) and the synaptic connectivity may be important in determining the dynamical state observed during spontaneous activity in neuronal networks .",
    "we have shown that the same principle holds true regarding the nature of dynamical states near a bifurcation point , e.g. whether or not the solution is subcritical or supercritical or which type of solution will be observed if several exist and must compete as is the case with sw and tw states .    in general the nature of a dynamical state in eq.[eq : rate ] near one of the primary instability lines depends on a complicated combination of the first three derivatives of the transfer function at the fixed point and the first three spatial fourier coefficients of the synaptic connectivity .",
    "we have derived these expressions and their asymptotic approximations in the limit of small delay . despite the complexity of these expressions we have tried to answer two specific qualitative questions : 1 - are delay - driven oscillations in general supercritical or subcritical ? , 2 - given realistic patterns of synaptic connectivity which is the most likely wave state , tw or sw ?",
    "the nature of the oscillatory uniform state depends on the balance of the first three derivatives of the transfer function .",
    "we find that whether the transfer function represents the fraction of active neurons @xcite or the fi curve of a cortical cell driven by noisy inputs @xcite , the oscillations are likely to be supercritical .",
    "this agrees with numerical simulations of hodgkin - huxley neurons ( not shown here ) as well as with the amplitude equation derived analytically for a network of integrate - and - fire neurons @xcite .",
    "we also find that for patterns of synaptic connectivity which decay in space , e.g. gaussian , the tw state is favored for small delay .",
    "the reason for this is that the competition between sw and tw in the small delay limit depends strongly on the sign and strength of @xmath97 , the second spatial fourier mode of the connectivity , see eq.[eq : a_vs_c ] . at the turing - hopf bifurcation point",
    ", @xmath72 , the bifurcation parameter , is equal to its critical value which is large and negative .",
    "the value of @xmath97 is constrained by @xmath72 to relatively large and negative values as well as long as the connectivity is narrow enough compared to the width of the system , i.e. it should go to zero at the boundaries , in this case at @xmath160 and @xmath161 , see fig.[diagram_tw_sw ] .",
    "large and negative values of @xmath97 favor the tw state by eq.[eq : a_vs_c ] .",
    "both of these findings are dependent on the parameter @xmath71 in eq.[eq : rate ] being small .",
    "as argued in the introduction this seems reasonable since @xmath71 represents the ratio of the fixed delay in interactions to the membrane time constant which are on the order of @xmath69ms and @xmath162ms respectively .",
    "finally , we have tried to emphasize the importance of fixed delays in shaping the dynamics described by eq.[eq : rate ] and by extension in networks of spiking neurons . nonetheless both fixed and conduction delays are present in neuronal systems and are roughly of the same order of magnitude in a small patch of cortex of @xmath163 mm in extent .",
