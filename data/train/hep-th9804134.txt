    "the study of pair - creation phenomena in the presence of an external field in a heat bath has attracted some attention in the last few years",
    ". there have been attempts to find out the temperature dependence of the decay rate by various groups ( see for instance references @xcite to @xcite ) .",
    "+ there exists many formalisms to calculate the pair - production rate for such a system .",
    "one of them is to calculate the effective action , the imaginary part of which is related to the vacuum persistence probability and the other is to compute the density matrix using functional schrdinger representation and from thence calculate the production rate . in the past , there had been investigations where the imaginary part of the effective action was calculated using the real time formalism or thermo field dynamics ( tfd)@xcite and also the imaginary time formalism @xcite of finite temperature field theory . on the other hand j.hallin and per liljenberg had derived the vacuum persistence probability for such a system employing the elegant approach of functional schrdinger representation  in reference @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the results of these investigations do not see to agree with each othre . some of the studies have found a finite thermal correction to the production amplitude whereas other studies have claimed to have not found any . in references @xcite and  @xcite a thermal correction to the decay rate have been found and the results of the two almost match except for a probable typographical error .",
    "+ on the other hand the results of references @xcite , @xcite and @xcite are in contradiction to @xcite and @xcite . in this note",
    "we shall concentrate on the findings of reference @xcite .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite claim that at a fixed temperature , in the infinite time limit ( as is assumed in the effective action formalism ) , the thermal correction to pair production rate vanishes thereby contradicting the earlier results found using the finite temperature effective action formalism .",
    "+ in this note , starting from eqn .",
    "[ 208 ] of reference @xcite  obtained by the functional schrdinger representation ( for the fermionic case ) , we will show that there is a _ finite correction _ to the pair production rate , even in the very large time limit at any nonzero temperature .",
    "this is in direct contradiction to the results obtained in @xcite .",
    "it must be noted here that though under some approximations this result reduces to the results obtained in reference @xcite and @xcite and we shall discuss the implications of that shortly .",
    "+ to be little more precise , we find that in the limit of very small time and high temperature the results of reference @xcite matches with those of @xcite and @xcite found in the high temperature limit . on the other hand in the studies of @xcite and @xcite the production rate",
    "is calculated in the infinite time limit as performed in the strict thermodynamic sense . in this paper",
    "we will also point out that the production rate when properly computed , turns out to be a function of time and it tends to diverge once the infinite time limit is assumed .",
    "in this section we start from the expression of probability @xmath0 , of finding the system with no fermion anti - fermion pairs in a state after a time @xmath1 , as is given in eqn .  [",
    "208 ] of hallin and liljenberg @xcite , @xmath2 \\label{p}\\ ] ]",
    "the first integral here gives the zero temperature schwinger pair production probability and since the controversy in the literature is about the finite temperature piece we will concentrate only on the second term in eqn.[[p3 ] ] . in the second integral the quantity @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 and it also appears in the exponent thus making the evaluation with exact @xmath7 dependence more difficult .",
    "therefore to circumvent this difficulty we propose to rewrite the exponential using an integral transform of the following form @xcite @xmath13 now if we identify @xmath14 with @xmath15 and the quantity @xmath16 as @xmath17 , we can write @xmath18   - \\frac{{\\bar{\\beta}}^2}{4u } }   \\frac{d u}{u^{\\frac{3}{2}}}. \\label{p4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the aid of eqn.[[p4 ] ] , we obtain from the second integral ( eqn . [",
    "[ p3 ] ] ) upon performing the @xmath19 integration @xmath20   - \\frac{{\\bar{\\beta}}^2}{4u } } \\nonumber \\\\                                                                       & = & \\frac{\\bar{\\beta } } { \\sqrt{\\pi } } e^ { - { \\bar{m}}^2 \\pi } \\int_{-\\bar{t_f}}^{0 }   d { \\bar{p}}^3   \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\frac{d u}{u^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } \\frac { e^ { - u \\left [ { \\bar{m}}^2 + ( \\bar{p}^3 + \\bar{t_f } ) ^2 \\right]-   \\frac{{\\bar{\\beta}}^2}{4u } } } { \\left ( \\pi + u \\right ) } .",
    "\\label{p5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    hereafter one can interchange the order of the integrations and carry out the @xmath21 integration first . upon performing this integration",
    "the resulting expression can be cast in the form of an error function with @xmath22 as its argument . rewriting the error function as a series we obtain @xmath23    in order to write the pair production rate in a more compact form , we make the following change of variables @xmath24 in eqn.[[sp5 ] ] and use the definition of pair production rate as given in eqn.[[s1 ] ] without taking the limit @xmath9 before hand .",
    "and the resulting expression is , @xmath25 it can be seen from eqn.[[sp6 ] ] that for any nonzero value of @xmath7 the pair production rate , contrary to the claim made in @xcite , is always nonzero . at zero temperature ,",
    "i.e , when @xmath26 , eqn.[[sp6 ] ] goes to zero because of the @xmath27 sitting in the exponent . and",
    "it conforms to our general expectation that as temperature tends to zero the temperature dependent correction to the rate should also vanish . on the other hand at a nonzero temperature , in the thermodynamic sense , as @xmath9 the rate becomes divergent .",
    "this is an unique feature that comes out of the treatment of reference @xcite .",
    "this is the main result of this paper . in the remaining portion of the paper we shall try to evaluate this expression numerically for different values of the parameters and",
    "write down the approximate analytic forms for each of these cases .",
    "in this section we evaluate @xmath28 for three different values of the parameters namely ( a ) @xmath29 and @xmath30 or little more , ( b ) @xmath31 but @xmath32 and @xmath33 and lastly ( c ) both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are @xmath36 but @xmath31 . in the last case we would vary @xmath37 to show how @xmath28 changes with its variation .",
    "+ we shall start with case ( a ) and then move over to the other two cases . in order to derive an approximate analytical form for @xmath28 for this case we start from eqn.[[p5 ] ] instead of eqn.[[sp6 ] ] as given in this text .",
    "since in this case both @xmath7 and @xmath38 are assumed to be @xmath39 and the parameter @xmath40 is of the order of one or slightly more , the quantity @xmath41 } $ ] is very small .",
    "since the integral there varies from @xmath42 to @xmath43 we would like to approximate the quantity @xmath44 in the denominator by u to arrive at @xmath45-   \\frac{{\\bar{\\beta}}^2}{4u } }   .",
    "\\label{p6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "having discussed the case for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we will try to evaluate the pair production rate for @xmath31 but @xmath57 and @xmath33 . in order to do that",
    ", it will be convenient if we proceed from eqn.[[sp6 ] ] .",
    "the first important thing to notice here is , as @xmath58 , the dominant contribution to the quantity of our interest comes from the first term in the summation .",
    "hence , for the dominant contribution , it is sufficient to retain the @xmath59 term where @xmath28 can be approximated by @xmath60 + since the dominant contribution to the exponential comes from @xmath61 , which for the parameter range of our interest turns out to be quite large , we will proceed as before by approximating the denominator by @xmath62 and then carrying out the @xmath62 integration using the modified bessel function of fractional order . on using the exact form of the bessel function eqn.[[app2 ] ] approximately comes out to be @xmath63 we have estimated @xmath28 numerically for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for various values of temperature ranging from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and have plotted them in figure [ [ expr ] ] .",
    "it can be seen that the shape of the curve is basically due to the function @xmath68 as is given in eqn.[[app3 ] ] . +",
    "lastly in figure [ [ time ] ] we have plotted @xmath28 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 as a function of @xmath7 , ranging from 100 to 101 in arbitrary units .",
    "one can see from this curve that as time @xmath7 increases @xmath28 also keeps on increasing .",
    "so in the strict thermodynamic limit as @xmath9 the @xmath28 would become divergent .",
    "starting from eqn.[208 ] of ref.@xcite we have shown that for a fermionic system , contrary to the claim made there ( i.e. in @xcite ) , at any non - zero temperature there is a finite correction to schwinger s pair production rate for any value of @xmath7.it is shown that the final expression ( i.e. eqn.[[sp6 ] ] ) comes as a power series in @xmath71 .",
    "though for small values of @xmath34 and @xmath37 , this expression seems to be finite , but in the proper thermodynamic sense it is not .",
    "since for realistic situations @xmath34 can never be zero , on the otherhand @xmath37 in principle can approach infinity , hence in the infinite time limit , the quantity @xmath28 tends to diverge .",
    "the reason behind this apparently contradictory results seems to depend on how one takes the limit @xmath72.in our view one should first carry out all the integrations and write down the final result as a function of @xmath7 , before taking the limit @xmath9 .",
    "though we have carried out this detailed exercise for fermions only but in principle this can be extended for bosons too .",
    "+ we would like to mention here that the same quantity obtained using the finite temperature effective action formalism ( where infinite time limit is implicitly assumed ) using both thermo field dynamics and imaginary time formalisms ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) yields a nonzero finite result . in view of the previous results we find this corrected result of reference @xciteto",
    "be quite amazing and in our view this deserves further study .",
    "particularly one should try to understand why the different formalisms are giving different answers and which one of them is correct .",
    "but in case the corrected result of reference @xcite which is obtained through the elegant formalism of functional schrdinger representation turns out to be right ( though we have some reservatio ns about it ) , it can certainly be used to estimate the thermal contribution to the soft processes dominated production mechanisms in the pre - equilibrium quark gluon plasma production phase of relativistic heavy ion collisions , at the sps and rhic .",
