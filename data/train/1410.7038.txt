    "inspired by ideas from origami , we discuss here the folding of curved surfaces with creases .",
    "we show , both theoretically and experimentally , that the curvature of this crease can be used to control the continuity of the deformation .",
    "the proposed design principle arises purely from geometry , and does not rely on special material systems or anisotropy to generate rapid snap - through transitions .",
    "we first consider introducing a crease onto a non - euclidean shell with finite gaussian curvature @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]a ) . though this concept has been realized on rare occasions in art ,",
    "the continuum mechanics of a creased shell is far from fully understood .",
    "origami , and deployable structures in general , utilize isometric deformations of thin sheets by introducing local weakening ( i.e. creasing ) of the material .",
    "likewise for shells , including a region of locally thin material ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]b ) allows deformations that are locally isometric ; whether or not this deformation is continuous is governed by the geometric relations we derive here .    using the geometric quantities defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]a ( see methods ) , we derive a relationship between the crease and the surface parameterized by the angle @xmath1 :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the curvature of the crease and @xmath4 is the normal curvature .",
    "this relation states that , in addition to its unbent configuration , any surface can be folded along this crease into an un - stretched state provided that the angle @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]a , right ) . this",
    " mirror reflection \" folding does not stretch the surface , but under what conditions can the surface be folded continuously ?",
    "considering isometric deformations , the only contribution to the elastic energy density of folding comes from bending energy @xmath6 , where the mean curvature of the surface is @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the bending rigidity of the shell ( see methods ) . for surfaces of normal curvature zero",
    ", these shells may be folded continuously . however , for @xmath9 , as the surface is folded the normal curvature on one side of the crease must pass through zero , and we find that the mean curvature @xmath10 . in order to fold the surface through @xmath11",
    "the surface must develop corners or kinks along the crease so that the mean curvature diverges , similar to stress focusing phenomena seen in other curved surfaces @xcite . since bending energy scales as the mean curvature squared ,",
    "the barrier between the folded and unfolded state is infinite for isometric deformations . in any real material ,",
    "as the shell bends the energy will reach a scale where stretching becomes favorable .",
    "thus , geometry alone gives a prediction for a design rule : by introducing a crease with finite @xmath12 an energetic barrier is created between a pair of locally isometric , bi - stable states . for any finite thickness shell , such transitions will require stretching of the surface and often lead to violent snaps .",

    "b ) * force - displacement for an uncreased cylinder ( red ) , a creased cylinder with free boundary ( blue ) , and a creased cylinder with rigid boundary ( green ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to test the applicability of this design rule we crease elastomeric and plastic helicoids , cylinders and spheres , whose gaussian curvatures @xmath0 are respectively negative , zero and positive ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]c , methods ) .",
    "the measurements consist of deforming the surface with a point indenter and measuring force - displacement response during folding of the shell . for most creases on these prototypical surfaces ,",
    "we observe snapping behavior where the force drops to zero as the surface snaps and loses contact with the indenter .",
    "however , for creases with @xmath17 , the force - displacement curve rises monotonically and no snap occurs , as predicted by our design rule .      to place a crease of zero @xmath12 on a surface",
    ", the surface must have non - positive gaussian curvature . on a helicoid ,",
    "examples of such creases are the straight  construction lines \" that are used to generate the surface . for these cases the fold angle",
    "can be changed continuously and no snapping transition is observed ( [ fig : force]a , insets i and ii ) .",
    "for deformation along any other arbitrary crease with finite @xmath12 , we observe a snap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]c , [ fig : force]a insets 1 and 2 , movie m1 ) .      creases with finite @xmath12 on a cylinder can be created by intersecting the surface with a plane at an oblique angle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry]c . according to our hypothesis",
    ", we expect the cylinder to undergo a snapping transition when deformed along this crease .",
    "remarkably , despite the introduction of a crease , the cylinder displays global bending deformation instead of snapping , in line with results from other studies on un - creased cylinders @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : force]b ) .",
    "such global deformations arise since cylinders have @xmath18 , and thus can easily bend without stretching , so that there is a pathway accessible to the shell that costs less energy than snapping but still satisfies the constraint imposed by the indenter .",
    "these pathways can be eliminated by imposing rigid boundary conditions on the free ends of the cylinder by inserting a rigid cylindrical plug . without access to these bending modes ,",
    "the cylinder undergoes a snapping transition that first involves an antisymmetric mode , followed by a full snap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : force]b , insets , movie m2 ) .",
    "mechanisms involving pure bending are avoided in spherical shells , since surfaces with @xmath19 naturally require stretching for almost any deformation of the surface . thus we expect that intersecting a spherical surface with a plane to create a crease ( fig . [ fig : geometry]c ) with finite @xmath12 will result in a snap .",
    "we create hemispheres with different crease radius @xmath20 and sphere radius of curvature @xmath21 , and define the normalized crease radius as @xmath22 . the force displacement curve for these surfaces",
    "are shown in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : force]c ) . for an un - creased shell ( @xmath23 )",
    ", we observe a monotonically increasing behavior , similar to previous studies@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we find that for small @xmath24 the load displacement curve develops a local minimum , but the `` snapped '' state remains unstable . for higher values of @xmath24",
    "the folding pathway leads first to an unstable , non - axisymmetric snap , soon followed by a well - defined stable snap ( fig .",
    "[ fig : force]c , insets , movie m3 ) .    to understand how stability depends on @xmath24",
    ", we consider the classical problem of indenting a spherical shell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy]a , b ) .",
    "there is a well - known nearly isometric deformation of a sphere , the pogorelov ridge , which is seen for displacements larger than the thickness but smaller than the crease size @xcite .",
    "this deformation regime is characterized by an inverted bulge of radius @xmath25 and bounded by a ridge of size @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy]b ) .",
    "the energy for this state has a bending energy contribution from the inverted bulge that scales as @xmath27 , while the pogorelov ridge , which contains all the stretching energy , scales as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the young s modulus of the material .",
    "hence the total energy for deformation scaled by @xmath30 can be expressed as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the fppl - von krmn number @xmath33 , with @xmath34 as the stretching modulus of the material . for a thin shell @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is poisson s ratio , such that @xmath38 .",
    "the fppl - von krmn number characterizes the balance between bending and stretching energies , and can be defined even for structures that are not technically thin shells , such as viruses and polymerized membranes @xcite .    in the case of a creased sphere , we assume that the deformation of the shell retains the same structure as this classical solution , but now the thickness of the sphere in the pogorelov ridge is a function of the bulge radius @xmath25 .",
    "since the crease is localized to a small region on the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : force]b ) , we define @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the regular thickness of the shell and the function @xmath41 is of the generic localized form such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 . with this assumption ,",
    "the energy for the modified pogorelov solution becomes    @xmath44    where @xmath45 . for schematic purposes ,",
    "we choose @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the fractional change in the thickness , and plot these results with @xmath48 for various different crease radii in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy]a .",
    "there is now a local minimum in the pogorelov energy centered at @xmath49 that generates an energy barrier that competes with bending energy .",
    "we estimate the regime of stability by setting the size of this energy barrier equal to the bending energy contained in the folded state :    @xmath50    the balance of these two energies yields a critical pogorelov radius @xmath51 such that a local minimum will appear at a finite value of @xmath25 . if @xmath52 , this bi - stability is accessible to the shell .",
    "solving eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) for @xmath51 , and setting @xmath53 yields the scaling law    @xmath54        to confirm this hypothesis , we use finite element simulations ( abaqus , _",
    "dassault systemes _ ) to determine the conditions under which there is a stable snap . for linearly elastic materials",
    "this system is fully characterized by two dimensionless numbers , the reduced crease radius @xmath24 and the fppl - von krmn number @xmath32 .",
    "we report the total energy for axisymmetric solutions with @xmath55 ( corresponding to the elastomeric hemispheres discussed here ) , as a function of the indenter displacement ( @xmath56 ) and the normalized crease radius ( @xmath24 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy]c .",
    "we find that , beyond a critical crease radius , there is a bifurcation of stability and the energy curves develop a well - defined local minimum ( solid ) and maximum ( dashed ) , with the region between these curves denoting a basin of attraction for the folded state .    by examining creased hemispherical shells over a wide range of @xmath32",
    ", we identify how the critical crease radius necessary for generating a stable snap depends on shell thickness ( fig .",
    "[ phase ] ) . through numerical simulations",
    ", we find that for increasing thickness larger values of the crease radius are required to create a stable snap .",
    "moreover , the boundary between mono- and bi - stable regimes is well - captured by the scaling argument suggested by our modified pogorelov ridge calculation . as a final test of our theory and simulations ,",
    "we conduct a series of experiments on spherical shells with a range of @xmath32 and @xmath24 , and identify the stability of the folded state .",
    "these too reveal a boundary between bi - stability and mono - stability , that is in excellent agreement with our numerical calculations and theoretical law .",
    "moreover , for some samples we observe the presence of folded states that are temporarily stable ( for times on the order of seconds ) ; the proximity of these samples to the predicted phase boundaries further demonstrates the agreement between experiment , simulation , and theory .     and @xmath57 .",
    "stability behavior in experiments is characterized as bi - stable ( , switches to folded state through a snapping mechanism ) , mono - stable ( , prefers unfolded state ) or temporarily - stable ( , closer to phase boundary : snap back on a time - scale of seconds without external perturbations ) .",
    "finite element simulations ( points solved denoted with * + * ) provide regions of mono - stability ( red shading ) and bi - stability ( green shading ) and the theoretical scaling law agrees well with both experiments and simulations .",

    "the ability to introduce tunable bi - stability into a curved shell via structural inhomogeneity represents a major step in generating programmable materials with rapid actuation capabilities .",
    "while inhomogeneous shells have already been predicted to serve as a template for constructing tunable shapes @xcite , and used to design next generation substances such as lock - and - key colloids @xcite or controllably collapsible capsules @xcite , our geometric design principle adds further insight into controlling the mechanics of thin shells . since the speed of the snap arises from stretching in the shell , inertia mediates the transition at the speed of sound in the material ( see movies m1-m3 ) , and crucially , the snap is unimpeded by poro - elasticity or hydraulic damping as displayed in many natural snapping systems @xcite .",
    "our work lays the foundation for developing non - euclidean origami , in which multiple folds and vertices combine to create new structures . finally , since the principles we describe in this paper are purely geometric",
