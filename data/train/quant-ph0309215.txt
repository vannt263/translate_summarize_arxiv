    "the quantum kicked rotor ( kr ) and its classical analog , the standard map , have long served as a paradigm for quantum and classical chaos @xcite . due to its atom optics realization @xcite ,",
    "the kr has recently attracted renewed interest .",
    "the kr is also of considerable interest in a variety of other fields such as condensed matter physics @xcite , molecular physics @xcite , and quantum information science @xcite .",
    "one well - known quantum effect in kr is  dynamical localization \" ( dl ) @xcite .",
    "that is , although a classical kicked rotor displays unrestricted diffusive energy increase due to classical chaos , only a finite number of rotational states are excited in the quantum dynamics , with the quantum excitation probability versus the rotational quantum number typically assuming a characteristic exponential lineshape .",
    "dl is a pure quantum coherence effect and is therefore very sensitive to decoherence .",
    "for example , previous studies have demonstrated that noise @xcite , nonperiodicity in the kicking sequences @xcite , and quantum measurements @xcite can destroy dl .    as a coherence effect , dl is also indicative of the possibility of controlling the kr dynamics via quantum effects @xcite .",
    "indeed , we recently showed that the quantum phases describing the initial rotor quantum state can be manipulated to effectively control quantum fluctuations in quantum chaos and thus enhance or suppress quantum chaotic diffusion @xcite in kr .",
    "however , manipulating quantum phases in initial states can not change the unitary evolution operator of the system .",
    "hence , neither the average dynamical localization length nor the characteristic lineshape of dynamical localization can be altered in this way .",
    "motivated by interest in controlled classically chaotic quantum dynamics @xcite , and to gain more insights into the nature of dl , we consider controlling dl and the associated energy absorption via a modified kicked rotor ( mkr ) system , in which the phase of the kicking field , or the timing of the kicking sequences ( hence the evolution operator ) , is actively manipulated .",
    "in particular , we consider an mkr system in which the sign of the kicking potential is periodically changed , or alternatively time delayed , after a certain number of kicks .",
    "as shown below , such a slight modification of kr has profound effects on the dynamics : whereas periodically changing the sign of the kicking potential does not destroy dl , it dramatically changes the quantum diffusion dynamics of kr as well as the nature of dl , offering entirely new opportunities for controlling dynamics , as well as understanding quantum fluctuations and correlations in quantum chaos in periodically kicked systems .",
    "for example , we demonstrate that , with the sign of the kicking potential of kr periodically changed : ( i ) the dynamical localization length is significantly increased so that the energy absorption is strongly enhanced ; ( ii ) classical anomalous diffusion ( which can be slower than quantum anomalous diffusion under certain conditions @xcite ) can enhance control even when the effective planck constant is about an order of magnitude larger than the relevant classical phase space structures , and ( iii ) dl may display strong deviations from purely exponential lineshapes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ mkr ] we introduce the modified kicked - rotor model .",
    "we then present results in sec .",
    "[ enhancement ] on the enhancement of dynamical localization length , with qualitative explanations based upon a known result from the band random matrix theory @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ anomalous ] we show control of dl in a different regime , where the dynamics can be tied to a new mechanism , i.e. , the creation of new structures in classical phase space .",
    "section [ non - ex ] contains the results on coherent manipulations of the lineshapes for dl .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief discussion in sec .",
    "the kr hamiltonian is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath2 is the conjugate angle , @xmath3 is the moment of inertia , @xmath4 is the strength of the kicking field , and @xmath5 is the time interval between kicks .",
    "the basis states of their hilbert spaces are given by @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the quantum kr map operator for propagating from time @xmath8 to time @xmath9 is given by @xmath10 \\exp[-ik\\cos(\\theta ) ] , \\label{qmapkr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with dimensionless parameters @xmath11 and the effective planck constant @xmath12 .",
    "for later use we also define the dimensionless scaled rotational energy as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the average over the quantum ensemble . in the @xmath6 representation , @xmath15 takes the following form @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath18 .",
    "the classical limit of the kr quantum map , i.e. , the standard map , depends only on one parameter @xmath19 and is given by : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scaled c - number angular momentum and @xmath22 represents the phase space location of a classical trajectory at @xmath9 .",
    "for later discussion we note that for particular values of @xmath23 , the classical map eq .",
    "( [ clamap ] ) can generate accelerating trajectories whose momentum increases ( or decreases ) linearly with time ( at least on the average ) .",
    "these trajectories are called _ transporting _ trajectories @xcite . to see this",
    "consider the initial conditions : @xmath24 for @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are integers .",
    "clearly , these phase space points are shifted by a constant value ( @xmath28 ) in @xmath29 after each iteration , resulting in a quadratic increase of rotational energy .",
    "these transporting trajectories are rather stable insofar as they may persist for values of @xmath23 close to @xmath30 ( with their average momentum shift after each iteration oscillating around the constant value @xmath28 ) , thus giving rise to transporting regular islands @xcite , i.e. , the accelerator modes in the kr case . if classical trajectories are launched from the accelerator modes , they simply jump to other similar islands located in adjacent phase space cells . for trajectories initially outside the accelerator modes , the `` stickiness '' of the boundary between the accelerator modes and the chaotic sea induces anomalous diffusion over the energy space , i.e. , energy increases in a nonlinear fashion , but not quadratically .",
    "this is intrinsically different from the case of normal chaotic diffusion in which energy increases linearly with the number of kicks .",
    "we introduce here a slightly modified kicked rotor ( mkr ) system whose hamiltonian is given by : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is real , @xmath33 , and @xmath32 changes sign after every @xmath34 kicks .",
    "that is , the only difference between kr and mkr is that in the mkr the sign of the kicking potential is changed after every @xmath34 kicks .",
    "the effect of changing the sign of the kicking potential can be further understood in terms of the time - evolving wave function , which can be expanded as a superposition of @xmath6 states : @xmath35 , with the expansion coefficients @xmath36 . since @xmath37 , and @xmath38=@xmath39 , changing the sign of the kicking potential is seen to be equivalent to adding a @xmath40 phase difference between all neighboring basis sates .",
    "compare this now to the effect of a time delay @xmath41 between two neighboring kicks . due to the free evolution of the rotor",
    "any two angular momentum eigenstates @xmath6 and @xmath42 will acquire in time @xmath43 an additional relative quantum phase given by @xmath44/(2t)\\ } = \\exp[i(2m+1)\\pi]=\\exp(i\\pi)$ ] . as such , the mkr can be also realized by introducing the time delay @xmath43 after every @xmath34 kicks .    for times @xmath8 to @xmath45 ,",
    "the mkr quantum propagator can be written as @xmath46 where this equation defines @xmath47 as the free evolution operator over time @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath48 denotes @xmath34 applications of @xmath15 . from eq .",
    "( [ mkr - map ] ) , one sees that the only difference in time propagation between kr and mkr for every @xmath34 kicks is the @xmath47 operator , whose matrix elements @xmath49 are given by @xmath50 thus we have @xmath51 note also that the classical limit of the mkr quantum map [ eq . ( [ mkr - map ] ) ] is given by @xmath52    with respect to model systems in the literature , the mkr here can be regarded as a specific realization of the so - called generalized kicked - rotor model , which was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of quantum anti - resonance .",
    "however , it is very different from the amplitude - modulated kicked rotor systems @xcite previously studied because ( i ) the kicking field strength here remains constant , and therefore any interesting results arise from pure phase modulations ; and ( ii ) as shown below , the dynamical localization is significantly altered , but not destroyed .",
    "as an example , consider the case of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , whose classical limit for both the kr and mkr is fully chaotic and displays normal chaotic diffusion .",
    "we demonstrate below that the dynamical localization ( dl ) and the related energy absorption associated with @xmath56 are dramatically enhanced over that associated with @xmath57 .",
    "figure [ hans - fig1]a displays the angular momentum distribution @xmath58 after @xmath59 kicks , starting with the initial state @xmath60 , for both kr and the mkr with @xmath55 . the exponential line shape of @xmath58 shown in fig .",
    "[ hans - fig1]a indicates that dl occurs in both cases . by fitting @xmath58 with exponentials",
    "@xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] for kr and mkr , respectively , one obtains that the dynamical localization length @xmath63 is significantly larger than @xmath64 . this clear difference in dynamical localization length is also reflected in the energy absorption shown in fig .",
    "[ hans - fig1]b . in particular , while the energy absorption of kr saturates after a few kicks , the mkr system continues to absorb energy in a more or less linear manner for as long as @xmath65 kicks .",
    "enhancement of dynamical localization length and energy absorption is also observed for other values of @xmath34 , and for a wide range of parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "as is well known , the dl of kr can be traced back to the localization properties of the eigenstates of the quantum map operator [ eq .",
    "( [ qmapkr ] ) ] .",
    "note first that , due to the rapid decay of @xmath17 with increasing @xmath68 and the pseudo - random nature of the function @xmath69 in @xmath70 , the quantum map operator @xmath15 in general assumes a band structure and behaves in a pseudo - random manner in the @xmath6 representation .",
    "hence , below we qualitatively consider the mkr results in terms of a well - known feature from band - random - matrix theory @xcite , namely , that the larger the band width of the quantum map operator the larger the dynamical localization length .",
    "note first that the matrix @xmath71 is pseudo - random .",
    "however , we do not expect @xmath72 to be a pseudo - random matrix of the same type since multiplying @xmath15 by itself @xmath34 times is expected to establish correlations between the matrix elements @xmath73 .",
    "nevertheless , we do assume that the matrix @xmath74 is banded and pseudo - random since the eigenstates of @xmath56 have no simple connection with those of @xmath15 .",
    "consider now an arbitrary matrix element @xmath73 .",
    "due to the quantum diffusive dynamics within the @xmath34 kicks , the @xmath73 with @xmath75 should be much greater than @xmath76 ( nevertheless , both of them can be very small ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ d2 ] ) , this implies that the matrix element @xmath77 is also much greater than @xmath76 . in this sense",
    ", we expect that the @xmath74 matrix should display a wider band than does @xmath78 .",
    "the band width of the matrix @xmath71 can be defined by choosing a cut - off value for its matrix elements .",
    "one traditional choice is @xmath79 . in this case",
    ", @xmath80 at the boundary of the band is on the order of @xmath81 , a number which is sufficiently small .",
    "however , this cut - off value , if applied to the matrix @xmath82 , would yield almost the same band width as @xmath15 .",
    "hence , quantitatively characterizing the band structure of the matrix @xmath74 is subtle , since the very small matrix elements @xmath77 must play an important role in enhancing the dynamical localization length of mkr .    to gain more insight we computationally examined the @xmath34-dependence of the dynamical localization length of the mkr . specifically , we numerically diagonalized @xmath56 , where each matrix is generated using @xmath83 basis states and is then truncated at dimension @xmath84 chosen below .",
    "we characterize the average dynamical localization length by the shannon entropy @xmath85 @xcite ( note that the shannon entropy is simply proportional to the dynamical localization length @xcite ) averaged over all approximate eigenstates @xmath86 of @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath87,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath88 equals 0.96 , and @xmath84 is chosen to be 2700 .",
    "the results for the @xmath34-dependence of @xmath85 , for @xmath89 to @xmath90 is shown in a @xmath91 plot in fig .",
    "[ hans - fig2]a .",
    "@xmath85 is seen to behave initially as a smooth increasing function of @xmath34 , and then to saturate at @xmath92 .",
    "to explain the results from the perspective of band - random - matrix theory , we choose a cut - off value for matrix elements @xmath77 so as to define the band width @xmath93 .",
    "interestingly , we find that this cut - off value must be extremely small ( roughly speaking , at least as small as @xmath94 ) in order that the @xmath34-dependence of @xmath93 resembles that of @xmath85 .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ hans - fig2]b displays @xmath93 as a function of @xmath34 for a cut - off value of @xmath95 .",
    "the evident similarities between fig .",
    "[ hans - fig2]a and fig .",
    "[ hans - fig2]b suggest ( i ) that we can indeed qualitatively explain the enhanced dynamical localization length in terms of the band - random - matrix theory , and ( ii ) that even extremely small quantum fluctuations in the values of the matrix elements of the mkr quantum map operator affect its dynamical localization length .    in particular , comparing fig .",
    "[ hans - fig2]a with fig .",
    "[ hans - fig2]b , one sees that the saturation behavior of @xmath85 for large @xmath34 is consistent with the saturation behavior of @xmath93 .",
    "the latter reflects the saturation of the matrix elements @xmath96 and therefore the matrix elements @xmath97 .",
    "as such , we infer that the saturation behavior of @xmath85 is simply a result of dl in kr .",
    "detailed studies on numerous other cases with varying @xmath66 and @xmath67 show that the above result , i.e. , @xmath85 first increases with @xmath34 and then saturates , is quite general , as long as the system has a completely chaotic classical limit and quantum correlations are insignificant . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath85 behaves differently , then there are two possible origins : either the system is in the deep quantum regime or there are non - negligible regular islands in the classical phase space .",
    "for example , in the next section we show cases in which the energy absorption in the mkr with @xmath89 is appreciably larger than that in the mkr with @xmath98 .",
    "in these cases one can obtain even more significant changes in dl .",
    "in the previous section we studied cases where both kr and mkr essentially have a fully chaotic classical limit . however , as shown below , the mkr can also display new non - chaotic classical phase space structures that are absent in kr .",
    "in particular , regular islands with very interesting transporting properties can be induced in mkr . in such cases",
    "one can achieve even more dramatic alteration of the dl than that shown above .",
    "consider first the classical mkr map eq .",
    "( [ cla - mkr ] ) for @xmath89 .",
    "interestingly , in this case there exists transporting trajectories that are different from those in kr .",
    "in particular , we have previously observed @xcite that for @xmath99 , trajectories emanating from @xmath100 will be shifted by a constant value [ @xmath101 in @xmath29 after each kick .",
    "this observation suggests that new transporting regular islands that differ from the accelerator modes in kr can be created by changing the sign of the kicking potential after every two kicks .",
    "this is confirmed in our extensive numerical studies , both here and in ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that in our previous work @xcite , we were most interested in the quantum - classical comparison in anomalous diffusion and considered relatively small effective planck constants .",
    "in that case we found that quantum anomalous diffusion induced by the new transporting regular islands can be much faster than the underlying classical anomalous diffusion . here , to make a closer connection to atom optics experiments we consider larger @xmath102 . in these cases",
    "the effective planck constant is about an order of magnitude larger than the area of the phase space structures associated with classical anomalous diffusion .",
    "intuitively , one would anticipate that such transporting regular islands are too small to be relevant to the quantum dynamics .",
    "surprisingly , this intuition is incorrect , as shown below .    to be more specific ,",
    "consider first the case of @xmath103 .",
    "figure [ mapkappa5 ] displays the classical phase space structures of both kr and the mkr with @xmath89 . while the regular islands seen in fig .",
    "[ mapkappa5]a ( the kr case ) are not transporting ( that is , the momentum of the trajectories launched from these islands is bounded and oscillates periodically ) , a simple computation reveals that the small islands seen in fig .",
    "[ mapkappa5]b in the mkr case are transporting .",
    "that is , classical trajectories launched from the right ( left ) transporting regular island shown in fig .",
    "[ mapkappa5]b have their momentum shifted by @xmath40 ( @xmath104 ) on the average after each kick , indicating that these islands originate from the marginally stable point @xmath100 with @xmath105 .",
    "hence , in this case phase manipulation in going from kr to the mkr has both destroyed the nontransporting regular islands of kr and induced new transporting regular islands .",
    "consider a second case with @xmath106 .",
    "the corresponding classical phase space structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ mapkappa10]a ( kr ) and fig .",
    "[ mapkappa10]b ( mkr ) ( note that , to clearly display the transporting regular islands , only a part of one phase space cell is shown here ) . while there are hardly any regular islands seen in fig .",
    "[ mapkappa10]a , two small transporting regular islands are seen in fig .",
    "[ mapkappa10]b . the average momentum shift for each kick associated with these two islands",
    "is found to be @xmath107 , consistent with the fact that @xmath106 is close to @xmath108 .",
    "consider now the quantum dynamics of these systems .",
    "there have been only a few studies on the quantum dynamics of delta - kicked systems where classical chaos coexists with transporting regular islands .",
    "of particular relevance is the previous result that the accelerator modes of kr enhance deviations from the normal dl behavior in kr @xcite , even for systems far from the semiclassical limit .",
    "since mkr displays new transporting islands , we therefore anticipate that dl may be strongly affected by modifying the hamiltonian from the kr to mkr system .",
    "this is indeed seen below .",
    "the results are , however , counter - intuitive , since the classical transporting regular islands created by phase manipulation of the kicking field are found to have an area that is much smaller than the effective planck constant .    for example , for each of kr and mkr , figs .",
    "[ kappa5-energy ] and [ kappa10-energy ] display energy absorption for the cases of @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath109 , @xmath111 ( corresponding to @xmath112 and @xmath113 ) , respectively .",
    "also shown is the mkr case with @xmath98 , discussed below .",
    "it is seen that the energy absorption associated with the mkr with @xmath89 ( upper dashed line ) is much larger than that of kr ( solid line ) .",
    "consider , for example , @xmath114 at a specific time @xmath115 when the energy absorption of both kr and mkr has clearly shown signs of saturation ( e.g. , the average rotational energy may decrease with time due to statistical fluctuations ) .",
    "in the first case ( fig . [ kappa5-energy ] ) , @xmath116 for kr and @xmath117 for mkr . in the second case ( fig .",
    "[ kappa10-energy ] ) , @xmath118 for kr and @xmath119 for mkr . in both cases",
    "a control factor larger than an order of magnitude has been achieved in going from the kr hamiltonian to the mkr case with @xmath89 .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath98 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 shown in fig .",
    "[ kappa5-energy ] . here",
    "the energy absorption in the mkr with @xmath98 is only slightly larger than in the kr and far less than in the mkr with @xmath89 .",
    "similarly , for the case of @xmath109 , @xmath111 shown in fig .",
    "[ kappa10-energy ] , although energy absorption in the mkr with @xmath98 is much enhanced ( compared with kr ) , it is still not as significant as in the mkr with @xmath89 .",
    "this indicates , as confirmed by directly examining @xmath58 ( not shown ) after saturation , that for both cases the dynamical localization length of the mkr with @xmath98 is no larger than that of the mkr with @xmath89 , contrary to what is observed in the previous section .",
    "this is because the underlying classical dynamics of mkr here is not completely chaotic , i.e. , the classical dynamics displays characteristics of anomalous diffusion due to transporting regular islands in phase space .",
    "thus one can expect statistical deviations from the band random matrix theory , used previously to relate @xmath34 to the extent of control .",
    "these results emphasize that the control mechanism here is uniquely based upon the transporting regular islands created by our control scenario .",
    "this is further supported by the lineshape for dl , which can be strongly nonexponential , as discussed below .",
    "it was pointed out more than two decades ago @xcite that the dl of kr can be mapped onto the problem of anderson localization in disordered systems . in particular ,",
    "an exactly soluble case of disorder in tight - binding models , i.e. , the lloyd model @xcite , suggests that dynamical localization should assume an exponential line shape , at least on the average .",
    "this has been confirmed by numerous computational studies on kr .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ hans - fig1]a clearly demonstrates , for both kr and mkr , that the distribution function @xmath58 can be fit beautifully with an exponential function with a characteristic localization length .",
    "however , the hamiltonian nature of the kr and mkr implies that there always exist some subtle quantum phase correlations in the quantum dynamics .",
    "hence , in addition to some universal properties of dl , the dl lineshape can display rich non - universal properties , e.g. , the system may display nonexponential dynamical localization .",
    "nonexponential dynamical localization has been previously observed in kr but its origins are still poorly understood @xcite .    here , we demonstrate that the mkr with @xmath89 can display strongly nonexponential line shapes for dl , rarely seen in kr .",
    "we focus on the mkr with @xmath89 since the classical mkr with @xmath89 has transporting regular islands that are absent in kr .",
    "second , transporting regular islands may induce large fluctuations in dl @xcite .",
    "however , we examine below cases with connections to anomalous diffusion as well as those without clear connections to anomalous diffusion .",
    "we have also studied other versions of mkr with @xmath120 , and have found that nonexponential lineshapes for dl in the latter case are much less common than in the @xmath89 case .",
    "figure [ pdis ] compares nonexponential lineshapes for dl in the mkr ( upper dashed lines ) to the analogous exponential lineshapes for dl in kr ( solid lines ) , for four different values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the lineshapes are obtained by propagating the quantum dynamics for 8000 kicks from the initial state @xmath60 , and will remain essentially the same for longer propagation times @xcite . the huge difference between the kr and mkr lineshapes is striking .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ pdis ] , in the mkr case , @xmath58 plotted in the @xmath121 scale displays structures that are far from a purely exponential lineshape .",
    "for example , one sees that the initial exponential decay rate of @xmath58 with @xmath122 is considerably smaller than its large-@xmath122 exponential decay rate , suggesting that multiple characteristic lengths are needed to describe the dl of the mkr .",
    "also seen is that the difference in @xmath58 between kr and mkr can be as large as ten orders of magnitude or more .",
    "further , figs .",
    "[ pdis]b and [ pdis]c indicate that the decay rate of @xmath58 for large @xmath122 in the mkr case is very similar to the kr case , although this is not the case in figs .",
    "[ pdis]a and [ pdis]d .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first demonstration that intriguing differences in the lineshapes for dl can be created by simply changing the sign of the kicking potential periodically .",
    "the four cases of nonexponential lineshapes shown in fig .",
    "[ pdis ] can be divided into two categories , based upon the properties of their underlying classical dynamics .",
    "the classical dynamics associated with the cases in figs . [ pdis]a and [ pdis]b , shown in figs .",
    "[ mapkappa5]b and [ mapkappa10]b , displays transporting regular islands .",
    "the presence of these classical structures implies an inhomogeneous classical phase space , and , as demonstrated in the previous section , may have a significant impact on the quantum dynamics even when their size is much smaller than the effective planck constant . in this regard , the nonexponential lineshapes shown in figs .",
    "[ pdis]a and [ pdis]b may not be totally surprising . however , for the other two mkr cases shown in figs .",
    "[ pdis]c and [ pdis]d , we did not find any regular islands in their classical phase space even when examined on a very fine scale , suggesting that their classical dynamics is essentially fully chaotic .",
    "thus , understanding the nonexponential lineshapes shown in fig .",
    "[ pdis]c and fig . [ pdis]d will be even more challenging .",
    "the nonexponential lineshapes for dl arise from extremely small quantum fluctuations and residual quantum correlations in quantum chaos . to be able to resolve the nonexponential lineshape for dl",
    ", @xmath58 has to be known with high precision .",
    "for example , the two shoulders shown in fig .",
    "[ pdis]b involve occupation probabilities @xmath58 as small as @xmath123 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that , while it is common to have strongly nonexponential lineshapes for dl in the mkr case , each individual lineshape is highly sensitive to the exact value of the effective planck constant .",
    "for example , for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ pdis]b , increasing the value of @xmath67 from @xmath124 to @xmath125 can completely destroy the nonexponential lineshape !",
    "this drastic change in the lineshape for dl even occurs without causing an obvious difference in energy absorption behavior . evidently then",
    ", both experimental observations and theoretical predictions of nonexponential dynamical localization are far from trivial and are in need of further study .",
    "this paper has dealt with control of dynamical localization in kicked rotor systems . in all cases",
    "we manipulate the external kicking field to alter the properties of the rotor system , i.e. the distribution of population amongst rotor energy levels after saturation as well as the energy absorption . in particular , we have examined the effect of introducing a reversal of the kicking field after @xmath34 kicks which , within the framework of quantum mechanics , corresponds to introducing a phase shift amongst rotor energy levels .",
    "two parameter regimes have been examined , one which shows enhanced dl lengths with increasing @xmath34 , and the other which need not .",
    "this behavioral difference can be understood in terms of the character of the underlying classical phase space : the former systems are completely chaotic whereas the latter show a mixed phase space that includes transporting regular islands . indeed , we have found that even if the transporting islands are tiny compared to the effective planck constant , they still have a profound effect on the control of the dl .",
    "further , a comparison of the traditional kicked rotor system to the modified kicked rotor systems shows that the latter is much more capable of displaying nonexponential dynamical localization .",
    "thus , by modifying the kicking potential are able to control the dynamical localization in the kicked rotor .",
    "the results of this paper are relevant to two fields of study : quantum control and kicked rotor dynamics . from the control perspective , modifying the kicking field changes the dynamics .",
    "however , this system does not obviously permit a picture in terms of interfering quantum pathways ( the standard view of weak field coherent control @xcite ) since ( a ) the kicking field is always on , and ( b ) there are a multitude of interfering transitions responsible for the observed behavior .",
    "indeed , it is even difficult to isolate the interfering pathways that are responsible for dynamical localization in the simple kicked rotor , whose dynamics is easier than that of the mkr .    from the viewpoint of kicked rotor studies in the field of quantum chaos , this paper provides insights into the quantum dynamics in the case displaying classical anomalous diffusion .",
    "as one of the results of this study , we find that classical transporting regular islands can dramatically affect the quantum dynamics even when their size is much smaller than the effective planck constant .",
    "further , the mkr system proposed in this paper provides a new model for the study of quantum dynamics where the underlying classical chaos coexists with transporting regular islands . by choosing proper system parameters , we can create transporting regular islands whose size varies from being much larger to being much smaller than that of the accelerator modes of kr .",
    "encouraged by this , we plan in the near future to further use the mkr to study quantum tunneling between the transporting regular island and the chaotic sea @xcite and between transporting regular islands , and to study the phase space structure of quantum eigenstates @xcite .    in the fully chaotic case , our approach suggests the need for additional studies of dynamical localization from the band - random - matrix theory perspective .",
