    "it is well - known that fcnc processes are very sensitive tests to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and , in particular , to supersymmetric extensions of the sm ( ssm ) .",
    "there are two main sources of fcnc signals in the ssm .",
    "first , since fcnc processes occur only beyond tree - level , they are sensitive to the existence of new particles circulating in the relevant loops . in this way ,",
    "the usual sm predictions on fcnc processes ( e.g. @xmath8 mixing or @xmath9 ) are modified by any ssm @xcite .",
    "second , besides the kobayashi ",
    "maskawa mechanism , supersymmetry provides new direct sources of flavour violation , namely the possible ( and even natural as we will see ) presence of _ off - diagonal _ terms ( say generically @xmath0 ) in the squark and slepton mass matrices . in the present paper",
    "we will concentrate on this second source of flavour violation , which induces not only modifications in the sm fcnc processes ( such as @xmath9 ) , but also the appearance of new fcnc processes , particularly in the leptonic sector , e.g. @xmath4 or @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we will focus all our attention on the constraints on @xmath0 from the @xmath4 process for the following reasons :    _ i ) _ : :    among all the fcnc processes ( both in the hadronic and in the leptonic    sector ) @xmath4 is by far the one with    higher potential to restrict the value of the off - diagonal terms ,    @xmath0 @xcite . _",
    "ii ) _ : :    unlike in the hadronic processes , the calculation of    @xmath4 is very clean and not affected    by big uncertainties .    actually , we will see that the constraints on the ssm coming from @xmath4 are not only very strong , but also that its evaluation is remarkably independent of the particular details of the model under consideration .",
    "let us briefly review the emergence of non - diagonal scalar mass matrices in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the mssm is defined by the superpotential , @xmath11 , and the form of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "@xmath11 is given by [ w ] w=_i , j\\ { h^u_ijq_i h_2 u_r_j + h^d_ijq_i h_1 d_r_j + h^e_ijl_i h_1 e_r_j } + h_1 h_2 , where @xmath12 are generation indices , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are the scalar partners of the quark ( lepton ) su(2 ) doublets , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are the quark ( lepton ) singlets and @xmath17 are the two susy higgs doublets ; the @xmath18factors are the ( matricial ) yukawa couplings and @xmath19 is the usual higgs mixing parameter . in all terms of eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) the usual su(2 ) contraction is assumed , e.g. @xmath20 with @xmath21 . from @xmath11 the ( global ) supersymmetric part of the lagrangian , @xmath22 , is readily obtained .",

    "in addition to this , the soft breaking terms ( gaugino and scalar masses , and trilinear and bilinear scalar terms ) coming from the ( unknown ) supersymmetry breaking mechanism have the form -l_soft&=&m_a_a_a + ( m_l^2)_ij |l_il_j  + ( m_e_r^2)_ij |e_r_i e_r_j + & + & ( m_q^2)_ij |q_iq_j  + ( m_u_r^2)_ij |u_r_i u_r_j  + ( m_d_r^2)_ij |d_r_i d_r_j [ nodiag ] + & + &   , where @xmath25 is a gauge group index , @xmath26 are the gauginos , and the remaining fields in the formula denote just their corresponding scalar components . in the simplest version of the mssm",
    "the soft breaking parameters are taken as _ universal _ ( at the unification scale @xmath27 ) .",
    "then , the independent parameters of the theory are [ inpar ] , m , m_1/2,a , b ( the rest of the parameters can be worked out demanding a correct unification of the gauge coupling constants and correct masses for all the observed particles ) .",
    "however this simplification is not at all a general principle .",
    "in particular there is no theoretical argument against @xmath28 , @xmath29 having a non - diagonal structure ( as reflected in eq .",
    "( [ nodiag ] ) ) .",
    "the ultimate reason for the specific pattern of these matrices has to be searched in the type of sugra theory from which the mssm derives ( particularly in the structure of the khler potential ) and on the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "both ingredients are nowadays unknown , although superstring theories offer plausible ansatzs , which , by the way , do not support in general the universality assumption ( we will turn to this point later ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that the yukawa matrices , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , may be also non - diagonal ( this is actually obliged for @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) . after performing the usual rotation in the superfields to diagonalize @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , the fermionic mass matrices and the contribution to the scalar mass matrices coming from",

    "if the @xmath28 matrices are not universal , they will develop off - diagonal entries , even if they are initially diagonal .",
    "a similar thing occurs with the @xmath29 matrices . in the following",
    "we will concentrate our attention on the @xmath35 terms , setting @xmath36 .",
    "notice here that @xmath29 always comes accompanied by the corresponding yukawa coupling ( see eq .",
    "( [ nodiag ] ) or eqs .",
    "( [ rgesc],[rgestr ] ) below ) .",
    "this makes its effect negligible when studying the impact of @xmath37 on @xmath4 . on the other ,",
    "hand @xmath38 is also constrained by fcnc processes @xcite ( and in particular by @xmath4 itself ) , but we will not be concerned by this issue in the present work .    from the previous arguments , it is natural to assume that the off - diagonal entries , @xmath0 , can be _",
    "sizeable _ , or even of the same order as the diagonal terms [ sizedelt ] m^2 ~o(m^2 ) .",
    "certainly , there are proposed mechanisms to avoid this , e.g. the above - mentioned assumption of universality , horizontal symmetries @xcite , plastic soft terms @xcite , etc . on the other hand , in some string scenarios @xcite",
    "@xmath0 could naturally be very small .",
    "however one should wonder whether , in the absence of any additional assumption , the perfectly possible and even natural situation of eq .",
    "( [ sizedelt ] ) could still be compatible with the experimental data and , more precisely , with the present experimental bound @xcite on @xmath4 [ megexp ] br(e,)510 ^ -11 , which , as stated above , gives the strongest constraints on @xmath0 , more precisely on @xmath39    this will be the main goal of this article .",
    "the results will turn out to be surprisingly model - independent .",
    "in fact they will depend only on two parameters : the value of @xmath0 itself and the gaugino mass , @xmath2 .",
    "also , we will make more precise ( and relaxed ) the assumption of eq .",
    "( [ sizedelt ] ) , namely our results will be valid for any @xmath0 satisfying [ sizedelt2 ] . in principle",
    "it might seem that @xmath40 is absolutely incompatible with ( [ megexp ] ) due to the existence of diagrams of the type of those shown in fig .  1 ( to be discussed in detail in sect .  3 ) .",
    "however this is not necessarily the case , since @xmath4 is a low energy process , while the assumption ( [ sizedelt ] ) naturally arises at some unification scale , @xmath41 .",
    "hence , an ordinary renormalization group ( rg ) running is in order . as a matter of fact",
    ", this running softens the problem , since the diagonal entries of the mass matrices increase substantially @xcite while the off  diagonal ones remain almost unchanged .",
    "this possibility has also been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , though the calculation was affected by very large uncertainties , as we will see afterwards .    in sect .",
    "2 the rg running from high to low energies is carried out , stressing the fact that the @xmath1 conjecture , eq .",
    "( [ sizedelt ] ) , automatically leads to a  gaugino dominance \" framework ( i.e. @xmath3 ) , where all the relevant low - energy quantities apart from @xmath0 itself are determined in terms of a unique parameter , @xmath2 . in sect .",
    "3 the complete calculation of @xmath42 is performed , indicating which are the most important diagrams and why .",
    "the results are presented in sect .",
    "4 . they are very general , depending only on the values of @xmath2 and @xmath43 , and have strong implications , in particular the need of a large and precise @xmath44 hierarchy in order to maintain the consistency with the experiment .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown that the analysis and results are valid for a wide range of @xmath45 values , as anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ sizedelt2 ] ) .",
    "finally , the summary and conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "the expression of @xmath42 in the mssm depends on several low - energy parameters , namely @xmath46 , @xmath19 , @xmath47 , and the spectrum of masses of sleptons and gauginos ( the details of the precise dependence are left for sect .",
    "these are not independent parameters .",
    "they come as a low energy result of the actual initial parameters of the theory ( see eq .",
    "( [ inpar ] ) ) , which are assumed to be given at the unification scale , @xmath27 .",
    "of course , the connection has to be made through the corresponding rges .",
    "next we list some of the most relevant rges in our calculation @xcite :    * gaugino masses : = -b_a _ a m_a , a= 1,2,3 [ rgegau ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 being the scale at which we evaluate the masses , @xmath50 are the coefficients of the 1loop beta functions for the gauge couplings , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the gauge coupling constants . * scalar mass matrices for sleptons : & = & _ ij ( 3 _ 2 m_2 ^ 2 + _ 1 m_1 ^ 2 ) - , + & = & _ ij ( 4 _ 1 m_1 ^ 2 ) - , where @xmath53 . * matricial trilinear terms ( also for sleptons ) : & = & - _ ij ( 3 _ 2 m_2 + 3 _ 1 m_1 + ( tr ( ^e h^e^)+ 3 tr ( ^dh^d^ ) ) ) + & - & .",
    "[ rgestr ] * @xmath19 parameter : = ( 3 _ 2 + _ 1 ) ^2 - ( 3 h^u h^u^ + 3 h^d h^d^ + h^e h^e^ ) ^2 .",

    "+ & + & . 3 ( h^d ^d ) + ( h^e ^e ) ) .",
    "[ rgeb ]    the first thing to notice is that , due to the structure of the equations for scalar masses ( [ rgesc ] ) , the ratio @xmath45 will in general be small at low energies ( even if it is @xmath54 at @xmath27 ) , provided that gaugino masses are bigger and @xmath55 will be given as a result of the whole calculation in the following sections . ]",
    "than scalar masses , @xmath56 , because of the contribution of the former in the rges of the diagonal parts of the latter , which is not the case for the off - diagonal entries ( note the @xmath57 factors in eqs .",
    "( [ rgesc ] ) ) .",
    "this is the reason why the rges have the potential to `` cure '' initial sizeable values of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the assumption of naturally large flavour mixing at @xmath27 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sizedelt ] ) ) leads us necessarily to the @xmath56 scenario .",
    "moreover , this sometimes called `` gaugino dominance '' scenario @xcite presents other very interesting features , such as that _ all _ the soft breaking parameters ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) are essentially determined _ at low energies _ by the value of @xmath2 at @xmath27 , independently of their initial values , as can be again easily seen in eqs .",
    "( [ rgegau ] , [ rgesc ] , [ rgestr ] , [ rgeb ] ) .",
    "so it is perfectly sensible to set the @xmath55s , @xmath47s and @xmath63 equal to zero at @xmath27 , then also @xmath64 , @xmath65 , since @xmath47 , @xmath63 are necessarily @xmath66 in order to avoid dangerous charge and color breaking minima . besides",
    ", the value of @xmath63 is related to the value of @xmath47 or @xmath55 in many supergravity models . for a review of these issues",
    "see @xcite and references therein . ] , and this is what we shall do for the rest of the analysis .",
    "note that all this does _ not _ apply to the @xmath19 parameter as it renormalises proportional to itself ( see eq .",
    "( [ rgemu ] ) ) .",
    "so , for a given @xmath56 , the only parameter left from the initial set ( [ inpar ] ) to determine the whole low energy susy spectrum is @xmath19 .",
    "however there is a constraint which we have not considered up to now , namely the requirement of a correct electroweak breaking .",
    "this fixes the value of @xmath19 , giving us the _ whole _ spectrum and other relevant low - energy quantities ( such as @xmath47 and @xmath67 ) in terms of a _",
    "parameter @xmath2 .",
    "from the technical point of view , we have performed the calculation along the lines already sketched in a previous work @xcite , that is , we have computed the 2loop rges for the gauge couplings and imposed their unification at @xmath27 , taking into account all the susy thresholds . also , to obtain a correct electroweak breaking",
    ", we have included all the spectrum in the 1-loop effective potential for the higgs fields , choosing the appropriate minimization scale as was already explained in @xcite . in this task",
    "( and also in the rest of the paper ) we work under the assumption that only the yukawa couplings of the third generation are the relevant ones , and their values are fixed by the experimental masses of the corresponding fermions ( for the top we take @xmath68 gev ) .",
    "the results are summarized in figs .",
    "2a , 2b . as a general feature , which is worth mentioning",
    ", we have found that the values of @xmath69 obtained in this framework tend to be rather large ( ranging from 11 to 26 as @xmath2 increases from 150 gev to 10 tev , as can be seen from fig .",
    "2b ) ; this fact will be very important in our calculation given the presence of a term proportional to @xmath70 in one of the contributions to @xmath42 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ amps ] ) in sect .  3 ) .",
    "we should comment here that previous analyses have ignored the electroweak breaking constraints , just fixing @xmath69 to a particular ( low ) value @xcite and making a certain `` average '' in some low - energy parameters .",
    "the present results indicate that this is an important source of error and uncertainty , which can be avoided by taking into account the electroweak breaking process .",
    "to summarize , a scenario of gaugino dominance ( which arises from the assumption of naturally large flavour mixing at high energy ) determines the low  energy spectrum and other relevant low - energy quantities such as @xmath47 , @xmath19 , @xmath67 , in terms of a unique parameter , @xmath2 .",
    "this is a very interesting fact that makes the subsequent analysis rather accurate and model  independent .",
    "we follow here a scheme of calculation along the lines of refs .",
    "the effective lagrangian that describes the @xmath72 decay is usually parameterized as [ oper ] l_eff = |_electron _ ( b_l p_l + b_r p_r ) _",
    "muon f^ , where @xmath73 .",
    "then , the branching ratio @xmath74 is given by [ br ] br(e , ) = , where @xmath75 is the fermi constant and @xmath76 is the muon mass .",
    "the @xmath77 , @xmath78 amplitudes arise from one  loop diagrams that involve a flip of the leptonic flavour triggered by the slepton mixing , besides the propagation of a neutralino or chargino ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that the structure of ( [ oper ] ) implies that the helicity of the muon and the electron must be opposite .",
    "since the electron and muon yukawa couplings are very suppressed , only the gauge part of the couplings of the charginos and neutralinos will play a role in the diagrams .",
    "in fact , one important consequence of the gaugino dominance framework is that for large enough values of @xmath2 the neutralinos ( charginos ) are almost pure neutral ( charged ) gaugino and higgsino .",
    "this result follows from the low - energy inequality @xmath79 , something that occurs whenever @xmath80 gev .",
    "then , the relevant diagrams , corresponding to bino ( @xmath81 ) and wino ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) exchange , factor . ] are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "some comments are in order here .",
    "the crosses in the scalar propagators of the diagrams denote mass insertions",
    ". these can be either of the @xmath84 type or of the @xmath85 type .",
    "the former occur in all the diagrams and correspond to the off - diagonal entries in the soft mass matrices of the sleptons .",
    "the latter , occurring only in diags .",
    "4,6 , denotes a change of chirality without flavour mixing .",
    "this arises from @xmath22 and @xmath86 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ lsusy],[nodiag ] ) ) once @xmath87 and @xmath88 acquire non - vanishing vevs . it can be checked that @xmath89 ( note that it is proportional to the fermion mass , which makes @xmath90 negligible ) , where from now on we will drop the superindex @xmath19 from @xmath91 . it should be noted that the diagrams of fig .",
    "1 correspond to an expansion in @xmath0 ( both of the @xmath84 type and of the @xmath85 type ) .",
    "this is justified due to the smallness of @xmath0 ( of either type ) compared to the slepton and gaugino masses .",
    "recall here that even though @xmath0 may be @xmath92 at @xmath27 , it must necessarily be @xmath93 at low energies in order to be consistent with the experiment ( this will become apparent in the next section ) . on the other hand",
    "the crosses in the fermionic propagators denote a change in helicity , which gives a factor proportional to the fermion mass .",
    "let us remark here that this emerges from the pure calculation and does not amount to any mass expansion .    splitting the induced @xmath94 values as [ descbs ]",
    "b_r & = & b^^-_r + b^^0_r + b^_r , + b_l & = & b^_l , the different diagrams contribute in the following way : [ bsds ] b^^-_r & = & d_1 , b^^0_r = d_2 , + b^ _ r & = & d_3 + d_4 , b^ _",
    "l = d_5 + d_6 , where @xmath95 correspond to diagrams 16 of fig .  1 .",
    "we have evaluated _ all _ of them .",
    "the expressions given in the previous literature are either incomplete or not directly applicable to our case . some of them correspond to the limit in which the photino exchange gives the main contribution ( which is not valid in this case ) .",
    "other estimates do not take into account the left - right mixing between charged sleptons , that will be essential , or ignore some of the diagrams .",
    "also , it is normally assumed that left and right sleptons are degenerated in mass and a different relative sign between @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ds ] ) below ) . ] .",
    "however , it is clear that a mass splitting will usually arise due to the different dependence of the rges , eq .",
    "( [ rgesc ] ) , on the gaugino masses . in the gaugino dominance scenario",
    "this effect tends to be very large , see fig .",
    "the complete expressions are : [ ds ] d_1 & = & + d_2 & = & - + d_3 & = & - [ amps ] + d_4 & = & + d_5 & = & - + d_6 & = & where [ emes ] m _ _ e ^2 = m _ _ ^2 m _ ^2 , m _ _ l ^2 = m _ _ l ^2 m _ _ l ^2 , m _ _ r ^2 = m _ _ r ^2 m _ _ r ^2 and f(x ) & = & ( 1-x)^-5 + g(x ) & = & ( 1-x)^-5 + l(x ) & = & ( 1-x)^-4 [ fs ] note that the equalities of eq .",
    "( [ emes ] ) do not come from any universality assumption , but from the mere gaugino dominance in the corresponding rges .",
    "although in principle all the diagrams can have a similar magnitude ( e.g. if we assume @xmath98 ) , in practice diagrams 4 and 6 are the dominant ones .",
    "this comes from the coefficient of proportionality @xmath99 , which turns out to be very important in the gaugino dominance framework due to the large @xmath67 value ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "finally , let us remark that the previous results on @xmath100 are in agreement with the recent paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , where charginos and neutralinos are allowed to be non - pure gaugino or higgsino states .",
    "the expressions obtained in the previous section for @xmath101 depend on two different sets of parameters .",
    "first , the different masses involved in the game ( @xmath102 @xmath103 ) and certain relevant low - energy quantities @xmath104 .",
    "second , the three independent flavour - mixing mass entries : @xmath105 . as explained in sect .  2 ,",
    "once we are working in the framework of gaugino dominance , @xmath106 , the first set is completely determined in terms of the initial gaugino mass , @xmath2 .",
    "recall that we were led to this framework by the mere assumption of naturally large flavour mixing at @xmath27 ( see eq .",
    "( [ sizedelt ] ) ) .",
    "the three flavour - mixing mass parameters , however , remain independent ( and we will consider them in that way in the following ) , although it is logical to suppose that they are of the same order .",
    "the constraints on the mssm from @xmath101 arise by comparing the above calculations ( eqs .",
    "( [ br][fs ] ) ) with the present experimental bound , eq .",
    "( [ megexp ] ) .",
    "we have illustrated this in fig .  3 , where an overall mass - mixing parameter @xmath107 has been taken for simplicity .",
    "then we have plotted @xmath42 vs. @xmath2 for different values of @xmath43 . from this figure",
    "we can derive the maximum allowed value of @xmath43 ( or , equivalently , the minimum allowed value of @xmath108 ) for each value of @xmath2 .",

    "notice that the _ ( d ) _ case is the less restrictive one .",
    "this is because , as explained in sect .  3 , given the large value of @xmath67 the dominant diagrams are nos . 4 and 6 of fig .  1 , which do not involve @xmath113 ,",
    "( [ ds ] ) . on the other hand ,",

    "( [ sizedelt ] ) , i.e. @xmath120 , the results of fig .  4 or eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) imply that , indeed , a very large hierarchy between the scalar and gaugino masses is needed in order to reconcile the theoretical and experimental results .",
    "this gives full justification to our assumption of a gaugino dominance framework once eq .",

    "for example , for @xmath121 gev the assumption @xmath122 demands @xmath123 . for smaller values of @xmath2",

    "( [ fit ] ) are so extreme that we can relax the assumption @xmath124 , allowing for larger values of @xmath55 relative to @xmath43 without losing the validity of the calculation .",
    "the latter is based on the use of the gaugino dominance framework , which is reasonably accurate for @xmath125 .",

    "it is interesting to compare these results with those obtained in the initial calculation of ref .  @xcite .",

    "the resulting constraints in the mssm , obtained by comparing the calculated @xmath42 with the experimental bound , are very strong ( see figs",
    ".  3 , 4 ) . more precisely , assuming @xmath131 , we arrive at the approximate constraint [ fit2p ] 34  tev ( and similar equations for other cases ) .",
    "this makes , in our opinion , the natural flavour mixing conjecture @xmath1 extremely hard to be reconciled with the experiment in a natural way .",
    "hence , @xmath132 should be small already at the unification scale .",
    "3 .   the required values of @xmath133 to be within the experimental limits are so large that the gaugino dominance assumption , which is an essential ingredient of our analysis , remains valid for values of @xmath6 much larger than @xmath0 , namely for @xmath134 , thus extending enormously the scope of interest and application of our results .    to perform the previous calculation",
    "we have completed the earlier evaluations  @xcite of @xmath42 ( see diagrams of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the results , summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ br][fs ] ) , are in concordance with the recent results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we would like to stress the high degree of model  independence of our analysis and results .",
    "in fact , in the entire calculation we have only made , for the sake of simplicity , the assumption of universality of gaugino masses at the unification scale .",
    "the relaxation of this assumption does not imply any essential conceptual change in the analysis , leading to straightforward modifications in the results of the paper , without affecting the main conclusions above .    finally , let us comment that the need of starting with small @xmath132 can be satisfied in some theoretically well - founded scenarios , which become favoured from this point of view .",
    "in particular , besides the proposed mechanisms of refs .",
    "@xcite , we would like to stress that many string constructions can be consistent with that requirement . more precisely , in orbifold compactifications schemes @xcite , which are known to give an interesting phenomenology @xcite , the soft susy breaking scalar masses always consist of a universal piece plus a contribution proportional to the so - called modular weight ( @xmath135 ) associated with the field under consideration @xcite .",
    "thus , scalar fields belonging to the same twisted sector of the theory ( or to the untwisted one ) acquire degenerate soft masses , something that can perfectly occur in many realistic scenarios .",
    "a similar thing happens in the so - called dilaton - dominated limit @xcite .",
    "other scenarios , however , can produce a larger non - universality of the scalar masses , with potentially dangerous contributions to fcnc processes @xcite . in any case",
    ", these non - universality effects are to produce non - vanishing off - diagonal terms in the scalar mass matrices once the usual rotation of fields to get diagonal fermionic mass matrices is carried out .",
    "the phenomenological viability of these physically relevant scenarios undoubtedly deserves further investigation .",
    "work along these lines is currently in progress @xcite .",
