    "in these notes , we mainly deal with the so - called @xmath0- and @xmath1-systems based on the lie algebra @xmath2 . these systems and their generalization to other lie algebras were introduced @xcite @xcite in the combinatorial study of the completeness of the bethe ansatz states for the diagonalization of generalized heisenberg quantum spin chains .",
    "apart from their original representation - theoretic interpretation as recursion relations for kirillov - reshetikhin characters ( @xmath0-systems @xcite ) or @xmath3-characters ( @xmath1-systems @xcite @xcite ) , these equations have reappeared since in various combinatorial contexts @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "we use here harmlessly renormalized variables that allow , by introducing sign flips , to connect the systems to cluster algebras with trivial coefficients , and by a slight abuse of language , we will still call the corresponding equations @xmath0- and @xmath1-systems .",
    "let @xmath4 , we define the @xmath2 @xmath0-system : @xmath5 and the @xmath2 t - system : @xmath6 this involves quantities @xmath7 with fixed parity of @xmath8 ( which we take @xmath9 mod 2 ) .",
    "the latter system is readily seen to reduce to the former , upon  forgetting \" the index @xmath10 .",
    "one way to realize this is to view the solutions of the @xmath0-system as those of the @xmath1-system that are 2-periodic in the index @xmath10 , with the correspondence @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath1-system may also be viewed @xcite as a non - commutative generalization of the @xmath0-system , in which @xmath12 is no longer scalar , but an invertible operator acting on a hilbert space with basis @xmath13 . in this formulation ,",
    "@xmath7 are the matrix elements of the operator @xmath14 in the basis .",

    "indeed , the system of recursion relations is a three - term relation in the variable @xmath29 , hence fixing all @xmath30 for two consecutive values of @xmath29 allows to determine all other @xmath31 s .",
    "moreover the expression for @xmath30 in terms of the @xmath27 is the same as that for @xmath32 in terms of @xmath33 , by translational invariance of the equations .",
    "we call @xmath34 the fundamental initial data set .",
    "the most general admissible initial data sets are indexed by motzkin paths @xmath35 of length @xmath36 , with the property that @xmath37 , and they read @xmath38 ( see fig.[fig : initial ] ( a ) ) . for instance , the fundamental data set @xmath39 is coded by the null motzkin path @xmath40 .",
    "the initial data sets @xmath41 are related via elementary moves , called mutations .",
    "we define the action of the ( forward / backward ) mutation @xmath42 , @xmath43 on a motzkin path @xmath44 as @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , when @xmath47 is also a motzkin path ( see fig,[fig : initial ] ( a ) for an illustration ) .",

    "admissible initial data have the form @xmath76 , and ( forward / backward ) mutations lead to @xmath77 ( see fig.[fig : initial ] ( c ) ) .",
    "a common feature of all these systems is that they share the so - called positive laurent property , namely that their solutions , when expressed in terms of any of their admissible initial data , are laurent polynomials with non - negative integer coefficients .    for the case of commuting variables",
    "this is actually part of a more general structure known as cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "a rank @xmath78 cluster algebra ( without coefficients ) is a dynamical system describing the evolution of  data \" vectors @xmath79 ( clusters ) of @xmath78 formal variables ( cluster variables ) , attached to the nodes of a cayley tree of degree @xmath78 , with edges cyclically labeled @xmath80 around each node .",

    "the exchange matrices @xmath91 are usually represented pictorially as quivers , namely graphs with oriented possibly multiple edges , with the condition that @xmath92number of edges @xmath93 when @xmath94 .",
    "the finiteness restriction of rank @xmath78 may be removed , while keeping the same definitions , leading to the notion of cluster algebras of infinite rank .",
    "the main property of cluster algebras is the so - called laurent property @xcite@xcite : every cluster variable of any node @xmath95 may be expressed as a laurent polynomial of the cluster variables at any other node @xmath96 .",
    "the positivity conjecture states that this polynomial always has non - negative integer coefficients @xcite , and was only proved in a few cases so far ( e.g. in the so - called acyclic cases @xcite @xcite @xcite , or that of clusters arising from surfaces @xcite ) .",
    "the above @xmath0- and @xmath1-systems have their variables belonging to specific cluster algebras in the following way @xcite@xcite .",
    "the initial data sets turn out to be some particular clusters of a cluster algebra of rank @xmath97 ( @xmath2 @xmath0-system ) or of infinite rank ( @xmath1-system ) . to specify the cluster algebras , we only need to give the exchange matrix @xmath98 at the fundamental node @xmath99 of the cayley tree ,",
    "while @xmath100 ( q - system ) or @xmath101 ( t - system ) is the suitably ordered fundamental set of initial data @xmath102 or @xmath103 defined above . for the @xmath2 @xmath0-system",

    "the aim of these notes is to present a unified approach for proving laurent positivity in all three cases described above , and to extend it to more general cases .",
    "this is essentially based on joint work with r. kedem @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the strategy consists of three steps . *",
    "step 1 * : construct quantities conserved modulo the evolution equations ( discrete integrals of motion ) , and derive a linear recursion relation for some subset of solutions , from which all solutions can be obtained .",
    "* step 2 * : rephrase the linear recursion relation in terms of a finite continued fraction expression for the corresponding generating function , which is manifestly positive in the initial data . in principle steps 1 and 2 can be repeated for each initial data set , but in practice , it is more efficient to only carry them out for one set of initial data ( say the fundamental one ) , and then use the * step 3 * : express mutations as rearrangements of the initial continued fraction , that preserve the manifest positivity .",
    "note that continued fraction language immediately translates to that of weighted paths on some target graphs .",
    "the laurent positivity results may all be rephrased in terms of partition functions of positively weighted paths on suitable graphs .",
    "the mutations that implement changes of initial data ( rearrangements of the continued fractions ) may be interpreted as transformations of both the target graph and the weights .",
    "this leads to theorem [ positq ] for the @xmath2 q - system ( section [ qsysec ] ) , a restricted version of theorem [ positall ] for the @xmath2 @xmath1-system ( section [ tsysec ] ) and theorem [ ncqpositaone ] for the fully non - commutative @xmath21 @xmath0-system ( section [ ncaonesec ] ) .",
    "this approach is actually restrictive inasmuch as @xmath1-system solutions are concerned .",
    "indeed , it only covers the case of translationally invariant stepped surfaces @xmath61 , with @xmath110 ( but arbitrary attached initial data @xmath111 ) .",
    "the only allowed mutations are actually compound , i.e. infinite iterations of elementary mutations that map such surfaces to each - other . to include the most general case of stepped surfaces",
    ", one must switch to a different point of view , by constructing for each stepped surface a weighted graph or network , from which the solutions can be computed explicitly .",
    "we shall not cover this case in the present notes , and refer to @xcite for details .",
    "the advantage of the present approach however is that it has a natural generalization to fully non - commutative settings , for which such notions as non - commutative continued fraction rearrangements exist .",
    "we illustrate this further in sections [ ncranktwosec ] and [ ncaffinesec ] .",
    "the general case corresponding to non - commutative weighted paths is investigated in section [ ncgensec ] .",

    "starting from @xmath127 , @xmath116 , and applying @xmath131 , we get @xmath132 which gives an expression for all @xmath114 , @xmath133 in terms of @xmath34 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath134 , @xmath116 is a laurent polynomial with non - negative integer coefficients , so are all the transformed expressions under iterations of @xmath135 or @xmath131 .",

    "let us express explicitly the effect of the mutation @xmath156 on the continued fraction expression , by noting the two following rearrangement lemmas , both easily proved by direct calculation :    [ reartone ] @xmath157    [ reartwo ] @xmath158 provided @xmath159    we write : @xmath160 where we have first applied lemma [ reartone ] and then lemma [ reartwo ] , with @xmath161 and : @xmath162    we conclude that @xmath163 is precisely the generating function @xmath164 where the @xmath114 s are expressed in terms of @xmath165 .",

    "the @xmath2 @xmath0-system possesses @xmath170 conserved quantities generalizing .",
    "these are obtained by repeating the argument of the @xmath24 case .    introducing the discrete wronskian @xmath171 we have the relation @xmath172 as a consequence of the desnanot - jacobi relation between the minors of any square matrix , also used by dodgson for his famous condensation algorithm @xcite .",
