    "over the last four decades , the no - arbitrage assumption has proved to be a fruitful starting point that paved the way for the elaboration of a rich theoretical framework for derivatives pricing known today as _ arbitrage pricing theory_. among its numerous achievements , the arbitrage pricing theory has set forth two fundamental theorems .",
    "the _ first fundamental theorem of asset pricing _ ( see @xcite ) proves that a market is arbitrage - free if and only if there exists a measure @xmath2 equivalent to the historical ( or statistical ) measure @xmath3 , which turns the underlying price process into a martingale .",
    "@xmath2 is therefore referred to as a _ martingale measure_. the _ second fundamental theorem of asset pricing _ ( see @xcite ) proves in turn that this martingale measure is unique if and only if the market is _ complete _ ( see @xcite for terminology ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath4 the positive valued price of the underlying at a deterministic future date @xmath5 and by @xmath6 the payoff of a contingent claim maturing at time @xmath5 .",
    "let us moreover denote by @xmath7 the marginal density of @xmath4 under @xmath2 with respect to the lebesgue measure on the positive real line , assuming that it exists .",
    "as initially proved in @xcite , the arbitrage price of this derivative security writes as its discounted expected payoff under @xmath2 , that is , @xmath8 where @xmath9 stands for the continuously compounded risk - free rate .",
    "it is a widely acknowledged fact that financial markets are incomplete , if only due to the presence of jumps in the underlying price process .",
    "in such a setting , and as described above , there exist possibly very many @xmath7s , and therefore , very many corresponding systems of arbitrage - free prices .",
    "let us denote by @xmath10 the corresponding set of valid densities @xmath7 .",
    "the elements @xmath7 of @xmath10 are most often referred to as risk - neutral densities ( rnds ) and we will stick to this terminology in the sequel .",
    "+ rnds are of crucial interest for central banks and , in fact , most institutions and people concerned with financial markets since they represent the market sentiment about a given underlying price process at a future point in time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they are also of crucial interest to the financial derivatives industry since the knowledge of @xmath7 allows to price new derivative securities in an arbitrage - free way with respect to traded ones . for these reasons ,",
    "the literature related to risk - neutral density estimation is very extensive , the bulk of it dating back to the late 90 s and early 2k s .",
    "it is not our purpose here to present an exhaustive review of this literature .",
    "excellent and up - to - date reviews can in fact be found in @xcite .",
    "older but still relevant ones can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ among derivative securities , call and put options play a very particular role since they are actively traded in the market and thus believed to be efficiently priced .",
    "let us recall that a call of strike @xmath11 and maturity @xmath5 gives its holder the right to buy the underlying security at maturity time @xmath5 at price @xmath11 .",
    "it is an insurance against a rise in the price of the underlying .",
    "its payoff writes @xmath12 , where we have written @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "conversely , a put option gives the right to sell the underlying security .",
    "it is an insurance against a fall in the underlying price and its payoff writes @xmath15 .",
    "here and in what follows , we denote the strike price by @xmath16 and not by @xmath17 , which will stand for a running index in @xmath18 . + according to the celebrated breeden - litzenberger formula , the second derivative of put and call prices with respect to their strike price both equal the discounted rnd @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) . therefore , if a continuum of put or call prices were available in the market , we would have direct access to the rnd by the latter formula",
    ". however , this is not the case and only a few strike prices around the forward price are quoted and actively traded at each maturity date . depending on the market , we overall reckon from @xmath20 to @xmath21 quotes at a given maturity date @xmath5 . to complicate the matter even more , quotes",
    "do not appear as a single price .",
    "dealers quote in fact a bid price , at which they offer to buy the security , and an ask price , at which they offer to sell the security .",
    "the difference between both prices is referred to as the bid - ask spread . for an interesting insight into the nature of option quotes and sources of error in them ,",
    "the reader is referred to , say , @xcite .",
    "as detailed above , if traded puts and calls at a given maturity @xmath5 are arbitrage free , they must write as their expected discounted payoff with respect to a single rnd @xmath7 drawn from the set @xmath10 .",
    "given the paucity of quoted option prices at a given maturity @xmath5 and the presence of a bid - ask spread , it is clear that many rnds could in fact be hidden behind quoted option prices .",
    "therefore , the rnd quest is not that much about estimating the true rnd that is used by the market for pricing purpose , since the nature of the quotes does not allow to identify it uniquely .",
    "it is rather more about recovering a valid rnd , meaning an actual density function , to be chosen according to a criterion typically related to its smoothness or information content .",
    "historically , three main routes have been used to recover a rnd from quoted option prices : parametric methods , nonparametric methods and models of the underlying price process .",
    "each of them have their pros and cons .",
    "parametric methods are well adapted to small data sets and always recover a density .",
    "however , they constrain the rnd to belong to a given parametric family . on the other hand , models of the underlying price process have been the first great success of arbitrage pricing theory with the celebrated geometric brownian motion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , the limitation of the log - normal distribution is now widely acknowledged and no satisfying stochastic process has yet been proposed that both reproduce accurately the dynamics of the underlying price process and be analytically tractable .",
    "nonparametric methods circumvent both of these problems in the sense that they do not require any stringent assumption on the process generating the data ( they are model - free ) and can recover all possible densities . as a main drawback ,",
    "these methods are often data intensive .",
    "+ let us briefly come back on some contributions to the nonparametric literature which are relevant to the present paper .",
    "we can classify nonparametric methods as follows .",
    "_ the expansion methods_. it includes the edgeworth ( see @xcite ) and cumulant expansions ( see @xcite ) , which allow to estimate a finite number of rnd cumulants .",
    "it also includes orthonormal basis methods such as hermite polynomials ( see @xcite ) , which rely on well known hilbert space techniques and give access to the middle part of the rnd .    _ the kernel regression methods_. as a recent example , @xcite have introduced a shape constrained local polynomial estimator of the rnd .",
    "notice that it performs estimation on the average quoted prices ( that is , the average of the bid - ask quotes ) and requires therefore to pre - process them in order to make them arbitrage - free .",
    "moreover , the returned rnd depends on the kernel chosen and it is not clear how it relates to the other valid rnds in term of information content or smoothness .    _",
    "the maximum entropy method_. it is introduced in @xcite , where the rnd @xmath7 is obtained via the maximization of an entropy criterion . according to @xcite , this method often gives bumpy ( multimodals ) estimates since it imposes no smoothness restriction on the estimated density .",
    "in addition , it is claimed in @xcite , that this method presents convergence issues .",
    "_ other methods _ , which do not belong to any of the three categories above . among them",
    ", we can refer to the positive convolution approximation ( pca ) of @xcite . in practice",
    ", it fits a finite ( but large ) convex linear combination of normal densities to the average quoted put prices and approximates the rnd by the weights of the linear combination .",
    "it thus presents similarities with @xcite , since it ultimately fits a discrete set of probabilities to the average quoted prices .",
    "we can also refer to the smoothed implied volatility smile method ( sml ) as in @xcite .",
    "this method uses the black - scholes formula as a non - linear transform .",
    "it consists in fitting a polynomial through the implied volatilities obtained from average quoted prices , and using the continuum of option prices obtained in that way to get the rnd via the breeden - litzenberger formula .",
    "@xcite refines this method by taking the bid - ask quotes into account at the implied volatility fit stage .",
    "the sml method gives access to the middle part of the rnd .",
    "@xcite proposes in addition a method for appending generalized extreme value ( gev ) tail distributions to it .",
    "the sml method is cumbersome and can seem a bit odd since it requires going from price space to implied volatility space , back and forth .",
    "it is claimed that it is outperformed in term of accuracy and stability by simpler parametric methods in @xcite .      in this paper , we propose to view the rnd recovery problem as an inverse problem . we first show that it is possible to define _ restricted put and call operators _ that admit a singular value decomposition ( svd ) , which we compute explicitly .",
    "we subsequently show that this new framework allows to devise a simple and fast quadratic programming method to recover the smoothest rnd that is consistent with market bid - ask quotes .",
    "+ to be more precise , let us denote by @xmath22 the segment @xmath0 $ ] of the positive real line .",
    "we define the restricted put and call operators , denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , from @xmath25 into itself ( see [ eq : rescallop ] and [ eq : resputop ] below ) and show that they are conjugates of one another .",
    "we prove that the resulting self - adjoint operator @xmath26 is compact . as a consequence of the spectral theorem ( see @xcite ) , @xmath23 admits a singular value decomposition with positive decreasing singular values .",
    "we prove that the corresponding singular bases are complete in @xmath25 ( see theorem [ theorem : svdcompact ] , item [ item : svdcomplete ] ) ) and compute them explicitly together with their singular values ( see [ figure : eigenplots ] ) .",
    "to fix notations , we will write @xmath27 and @xmath28 the two orthonormal families of @xmath25 such that @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a positive decreasing sequence of singular values . precisely , we obtain explicitly , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and , for all @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the smallest positive solution of the following fixed point equation in @xmath36 , @xmath37 interestingly , the positive sequence @xmath38 decreases exponentially fast toward zero as detailed in lemma [ lemma : thetak ] .",
    "therefore , the sequence of singular values @xmath31 tends asymptotically toward zero at a rate of order @xmath39 .",
    "the rnd recovery problem is therefore said to be mildly ill - posed with a degree of ill - posedness equal to @xmath40 ( see @xcite ) . furthermore , for all @xmath41 , we obtain , @xmath42 where the coefficients @xmath43 are such that , @xmath44\\\\   a_{k,2 } & = ( -1)^{k}e^{\\rho_k}a_{k,1 } = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b } }   \\frac{1}{1 + ( -1)^{k }    e^{-\\rho_k } } , \\displaybreak[2]\\\\ a_{k,3 } & = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b } } , \\displaybreak[2]\\\\ a_{k,4 } & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{b } } \\frac{1-(-1)^{k}e^{-\\rho_k}}{1+(-1)^{k}e^{-\\rho_k}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    based on this new framework , we propose a spectral approach to rnd recovery .",
    "it is fully nonparametric and can recover the restriction of any density to the interval @xmath22 .",
    "to that end , we notice that the singular bases functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are in fact oscillations @xmath47 at frequency @xmath48 carried by the exponential trend @xmath49 ( see [ eq : hkdef ] and [ eq : defrhok ] for notations ) .",
    "conveniently , smooth densities are therefore essentially captured by low singular spaces .",
    "the idea of recovering the smoothest density among the valid ones was initially suggested in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite correctly pointed out that the smoothness criterion can be debated as it is difficult to give it an economic or even information theoretic meaning .",
    "our spectral approach sheds some new light on this issue and makes it clear that the smoothness criterion is justified by the fact that the restricted call and put operators behave as low - pass frequency filters .",
    "it is therefore illusory to look for high frequency information about the rnd in a set of quoted options prices , since this information has been drastically attenuated by the operator .",
    "the smoothness criterion arises therefore as a by - product of the spectral nature of the restricted put and call operators and might well not be an intrinsic property of the true rnd .",
    "interestingly , smooth densities are also easier to recover by nonparametric means .",
    "+ in what follows , we exploit the rich framework offered by the svd of the restricted put and call operators to recover the smoothest rnd that is compatible with market quotes . as detailed in [ eq : puttocoeffs ] below , the discounted restricted put operator coincides with the put price function ( as a function of the strike ) on @xmath22 .",
    "we therefore propose to recover the smoothest rnd such that its image by the discounted restricted put operator @xmath50 lies in - between the bid - ask quotes ( see [ eq : puttocoeffs ] ) . conveniently , the singular bases present the property of being image of one another by second derivation modulo a multiplication by the corresponding singular value of @xmath23 ( see theorem [ theorem : svdbasisprop ] ) .",
    "this allows us to characterize the smoothness of the estimated rnd directly in term of a quadratic form of the coefficients of the estimated put price function , which depends on the singular values of the restricted put operator ( see proposition [ proposition : smoothness ] ) .",
    "this crucial feature allows to recover the smoothest rnd as the solution of a simple quadratic program , which takes the bid ask quotes as sole input .",
    "our estimation method improves on existing ones in several ways , which we sum up here .",
    "it is fast and simple to implement since it only requires solution of a single quadratic program , while being fully nonparametric .",
    "it is robust to the paucity of price quotes since the smaller the number of quotes , the less constrained the quadratic program and thus the easier to solve .",
    "it takes the bid ask quotes as sole input and does not require any sort of smoothing or preprocessing of the data .",
    "it returns the smoothest density giving rise to price quotes that lie inside the bid ask quotes .",
    "the estimated rnd is therefore as well - behaved as can be .",
    "it returns a closed form estimate of the rnd on @xmath22 .",
    "we thus obtain both the middle part of the rnd together with its left tail and part of its right tail .",
    "interestingly , the left tail contains crucial information about market sentiments relative to a potential forthcoming market crash .",
    "it is noteworthy that the singular vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 corresponding to the largest singular value @xmath53 of @xmath24 and @xmath23 look themselves very much like cross sections of put and call prices , respectively ( see [ figure : eigenplots ] ) . in that sense , they will be able to capture the bulk of the shape of a cross section of option prices , while the subsequent singular vectors will add corrections to this general behavior .",
    "this is a crucial feature of this svd that leads us to think that the singular bases of the restricted pricing operators are appropriate tools to recover the rnd @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , the performance of our quadratic programming algorithm on real data is indeed quite convincing ( see [ section : simuls ] for details ) .",
    "+ readers interested in appending a full right tail to this estimated rnd are referred to @xcite , who proposes a simple method for smooth pasting of parametric gev tail distributions to an estimated rnd . + here is the paper layout . we introduce the restricted call and put operators , @xmath24 and @xmath23 , and operators derived therefrom in [ section : def ] .",
    "we detail the properties of operators @xmath26 and @xmath54 on the one hand , and @xmath24 and @xmath23 on the other hand , in [ section : prelim ] and [ section : restrictedprop ] , respectively .",
    "other results relative to these four operators are reported in [ section : otherres ] .",
    "[ section : explicitcomp ] gives explicit expressions for the @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the spectral recovery method ( srm ) is detailed in [ section : srm ] .",
    "finally , we run a simulation study in [ section : simuls ] .",
    "an appendix regroups some additional useful results .",
    "let us define the restricted call operator on the interval @xmath58 $ ] as the operator @xmath24 from @xmath25 into @xmath25 such that , @xmath59 it is a trivial fact that @xmath60 belongs indeed to @xmath25 .",
    "let s denote by @xmath61 the usual scalar product on @xmath25 and by @xmath62 the associated norm .",
    "now , it is enough to notice that for all @xmath63 , @xmath64 and apply cauchy - schwartz inequality to obtain , @xmath65 the adjoint operator @xmath23 of @xmath24 is such that , for all @xmath66 , @xmath67 hence @xmath68 so that @xmath23 is nothing but the restricted put operator on the interval @xmath22 . in particular",
    ", we can write @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 let us now turn to the detailed inspection of these operators .",
    "let us denote by @xmath72 the range of an operator @xmath73 of @xmath25 and by @xmath74 its null space ( see @xcite ) . obviously both @xmath26 and @xmath54 are self - adjoint .",
    "this translates into the fact that their kernels are symmetric ( meaning @xmath75 ) .",
    "in addition , both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are continuous on the bounded square @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the associated operators are compact ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a new method for estimating the conditional risk - neutral density ( rnd ) directly from a cross - section of put option bid - ask quotes . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we propose to view the rnd recovery problem as an inverse problem . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that it is possible to define _ restricted put and call operators _ that admit a singular value decomposition ( svd ) , which we compute explicitly . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently show that this new framework allows us to devise a simple and fast quadratic programming method to recover the smoothest rnd whose corresponding put prices lie inside the bid - ask quotes . </S>",
    "<S> this method is termed the spectral recovery method ( srm ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the svd of the restricted put and call operators sheds some new light on the rnd recovery problem . </S>",
    "<S> the srm improves on other rnd recovery methods in the sense that    it is fast and simple to implement since it requires solution of a single quadratic program , while being fully nonparametric ;    it takes the bid ask quotes as sole input and does not require any sort of calibration , smoothing or preprocessing of the data ;    it is robust to the paucity of price quotes ;    it returns the smoothest density giving rise to prices that lie inside the bid ask quotes . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated rnd is therefore as well - behaved as can be ;    it returns a closed form estimate of the rnd on the interval @xmath0 $ ] of the positive real line , where @xmath1 is a positive constant that can be chosen arbitrarily . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtain both the middle part of the rnd together with its full left tail and part of its right tail .    </S>",
    "<S> we confront this method to both real and simulated data and observe that it fares well in practice . </S>",
    "<S> the srm is thus found to be a promising alternative to other rnd recovery methods .    </S>",
