    "in the standard formulations of lattice qcd , the dirac operator becomes singular in the chiral ( zero quark mass ) limit .",
    "this prevents one from simulating at zero quark mass , and makes simulations at small quark masses prohibitively expensive .",
    "in addition , since the chiral condensate vanishes on a configuration by configuration basis in this limit , even if one were able to perform zero - mass simulations , such simulations would tell us nothing about spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we have modified the standard staggered - quark action for lattice qcd by the addition of a chiral 4-fermion interaction of the form of gross - neveu chiral extension of the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite .",
    "the idea of combining gauge theories with 4-fermion interactions has been explored by others @xcite .",
    "we choose our 4-fermion operator to preserve the reduced symmetries of the staggered - quark action .",
    "this new action , by generating a chiral - symmetry preserving `` dynamical quark mass '' , renders the dirac operator non - singular , even for zero quark mass .",
    "in addition , the chiral condensate also remains finite in the chiral limit on each configuration .",
    "the chiral condensate vanishes as it must on any finite lattice , because the orientation of the condensate rotates from configuration to configuration such that the average over the infinite ensemble of configurations vanishes .",
    "this method of enforcing the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking on a finite lattice is identical to that seen in simple spin models , giving us confidence that we should be able to use this action to study critical behaviour of qcd , in the same way that these spin models allow determination of their critical behaviour using monte - carlo methods ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "two - flavour qcd is expected to have a second - order finite temperature chiral - symmetry - restoring ( deconfining ) phase transition at zero quark mass .",
    "this transition is expected to lie in the universality class of the 3-dimensional @xmath6 sigma model . with the reduced symmetry of the staggered lattice",
    "we would expect this transition to lie in the universality class of the @xmath7 sigma model , until the lattice spacing is fine enough that the transition is sensitive to the continuum symmetry . at non - zero quark mass , this transition is expected to soften to a mere crossover . hence to study this second order transition ,",
    "it is necessary to simulate at zero quark mass ( or so close to zero that the chiral extrapolation is unambiguous ) .",
    "our earlier simulations on @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 lattices @xcite showed the nature of the transition to be sensitive to lattice artifacts on such coarse lattices .",
    "the transition for @xmath0 could be made first or second order , depending on the size of the 4-fermion coupling .",
    "the @xmath1 transition appeared to be second order , but the measured critical exponents were those characteristic of a tricritical point , rather than those of the @xmath8 spin models .",
    "we are now extending these simulations to @xmath2 where the lattice artifacts will be appreciably smaller .    in section  2",
    "we define our new , `` @xmath9qcd '' , staggered action .",
    "section  3 describes our ongoing @xmath2 simulations and presents some preliminary results . in section",
    "4 we give our conclusions and plans for the future .",
    "the standard staggered quark action differs from the continuum action by terms @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the lattice spacing .",
    "this means we have the freedom to add terms which only contribute at @xmath10 relative to the standard action , i.e. dimension 6 or higher operators .",
    "all such additions will do is change the size of the @xmath10 corrections and hence the approach to the continuum .",
    "however , such actions will have the same continuum limit as the standard action .",
    "we choose to add a chiral 4-fermion interaction of the gross - neveu form @xcite to the standard staggered action .",
    "since we are interested in 2-flavour qcd , we choose an action whose naive continuum form would be @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{eqn : lagrangian2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the number of @xmath14 flavour doublets .",
    "since the fermion doubling in the staggered fermion lattice implementation leads naturally to 4 flavours , the actual continuum action will be @xmath15 .",
    "\\label{eqn : lagrangian4}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of @xmath17 flavour quartets .",
    "clearly these two forms are equivalent if we replace @xmath18 since @xmath19 .",
    "now we turn to the staggered lattice implementation of qcd with such 4-fermion interactions @xcite .",
    "the fermion part of the action is @xmath20\\chi + \\sum_{\\tilde{s}}\\frac{1}{8}n_f\\gamma(\\sigma^2+\\pi^2),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are auxiliary fields residing on the dual lattice and @xmath24 runs over the 16 sites on the dual lattice closest to the site @xmath25 .",
    "integrating out these auxiliary fields gives the lattice version of equation  [ eqn : lagrangian4 ] , remembering that the total number of flavours @xmath26 . here",
    "since the fermion determinant becomes real in the continuum limit , we use the determinant of @xmath28 for our simulations and take the 4th root of this determinant using the hybrid molecular - dynamics method with ` noisy ' fermions to get @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to lattice qcd with this action `` @xmath9qcd '' .",
    "it is easy to see that this action preserves the same @xmath30 vestige of the @xmath17 continuum chiral symmetry that is preserved by the standard staggered action at @xmath31 , which is why this particular form was chosen .",
    "the reason it is possible to simulate this action at zero quark mass is clear in the confined phase . here",
    "@xmath32 develops an expectation value .",
    "hence since @xmath33 the quark field develops an effective mass @xmath34 , which makes the dirac operator non - singular . what is less clear is why the dirac operator remains non - singular in the chirally symmetric phase .",
    "@xmath35 should be chosen large so that the 4-fermion coupling is small and thus any additional flavour symmetry breaking over that already present in the standard staggered action , is also small . in particular @xmath35 should be chosen far larger than that for which there is a bulk transition in the absence of the gauge fields .",
    "in addition we shall try to keep @xmath35 large enough that the critical value of @xmath36 is not too far from that without the 4-fermion term , i.e. the gauge interactions should be primarily responsible for quark binding and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath1 simulations showed evidence that the nature of the finite temperature phase transition was being affected by finite lattice spacing artifacts , we are now simulating at @xmath2 .",
    "in particular we are running on @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 lattices .",
    "we are currently running at zero quark mass with @xmath37 . at this @xmath35",
    "we are able to use a molecular - dynamics time increment of @xmath38 , and find that at the worst it takes 600 - 700 conjugate gradient iterations to invert the dirac operator . however , because we now have a true critical point in the infinite volume limit , we have to face critical slowing down . for this reason we ran for 50,000 time units for each @xmath39 in the transition region and are extending these runs to 100,000 time units .",
    "let us now look at our preliminary results . in figure",
    "[ fig : wil - psi ] we show the wilson line ( polyakov loop ) and the chiral condensate as functions of @xmath39 across the transition region .",
    "the chiral condensate plotted here is really @xmath40 .",
    "what we see is that the transition region , @xmath41 , is very narrow , which explains why it is so difficult to make quantitative measurements for standard actions at non - zero quark masses .",
    "the crossover appears quite smooth which suggests that it is second order .",
    "long - time correlations , which are apparent when one looks at the time histories of the measured observables close to the transition , also point to the transition being second order .    the chiral order parameter ` @xmath42 ' or ` @xmath43 ' is non - zero on each configuration , but its orientation in the @xmath44 or equivalently @xmath45 plane rotates from configuration to configuration ( here the @xmath46 represents the lattice average for a given configuration ) .",
    "it is this rotation that makes the ensemble average zero as it must be for a finite lattice . in figure",
    "[ fig : chiral ] , we show the distribution of values of the chiral condensate during runs at several @xmath39s on a @xmath5 lattice .",
    "what we notice for @xmath47 and @xmath48 is that these points are concentrated in an annulus of non - zero radius .",
    "this is an indication that these @xmath39s lie in the low - temperature phase where the chiral order parameter is non - zero .",
    "for @xmath49 there is no such annulus and the distribution peaks near the origin .",
    "this suggests that @xmath49 lies in the high temperature phase , where the chiral order parameter is zero and chiral symmetry is restored . from these observations , we would predict that the critical @xmath39 , @xmath50 lies in the range @xmath51 .",
    "we also note that these distributions appear to have a circular symmetry in the plane .",
    "this ensures that the ensemble average will be zero . to see the distribution in the radial",
    "coordinate more clearly we have histogrammed these distributions to equal - size bins in @xmath52 which yields a quantity proportional to the density in the planes of figure  [ fig : chiral ] .",
    "these histograms are presented in figure  [ fig : chiral_hist ] .",
    "now let us examine the chiral condensate in more detail . in figure",
    "[ fig : pbp ] we plot the chiral condensates from figure  [ fig : wil - psi ] .",
    "because of the way in which the chiral condensate rotates from configuration to configuration , any methods used to derive the ensemble averaged condensate which has the correct continuum limit in the ordered phase will , of necessity , smooth out the transition .",
    "it is then a matter of ` experimentation ' to determine which method is easiest to extrapolate to the infinite volume limit .",
    "the figure shows the average of the magnitude of the condensate , which has enjoyed some success with analyzing spin models @xcite . the other method which we have used is to average the squares of the condensates .    to determine the first of the critical exponents @xmath53",
    ", we need to fit the chiral condensate to the scaling form @xmath54 for @xmath39 close to @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath53 serves to distinguish the universality class of the transition .",
    "@xmath55 for @xmath6 , @xmath56 for @xmath7 , @xmath57 for a tricritical point and @xmath58 for a mean - field transition @xcite .",
    "while it is doubtful if we will accumulate enough statistics to distinguish @xmath7 from @xmath6 behaviour , we should be able to distinguish @xmath8 behaviour from mean - field or tricritical behaviour .",
    "fitting our current @xmath5 ` data ' to this scaling form over the range @xmath59 gives @xmath60 .",
    "this should improve when we finish extending our statistics from 50,000 to 100,000 trajectories for all @xmath39s in the scaling window .",
    "in addition , we have yet to extract the maximum information from our ` data ' by using ferrenberg - swendsen interpolation methods @xcite to increase the number of @xmath39 values contributing to our fit .",
    "another method to obtain information on the position and nature of the transition is to use 4th - order binder cumulants for our order parameter , for several lattice sizes .",
    "the 4-th order cumulant for the auxiliary fields is defined as @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "here we use the auxiliary fields rather than @xmath63 because we only have a single stochastic estimator for these fermionic order parameters for each trajectory , and we would need at least 4 such estimators / configuration to be able to obtain an unbiased estimator of @xmath64 . note that @xmath64 uses quantities measured on finite lattices , and does not suffer from the difficulties one encounters with trying to estimate the chiral condensate itself .",
    "@xmath65 for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xmath66 for a tricritical point and @xmath67 for a mean - field transition @xcite .",
    "@xmath68 for a crossover .",
    "@xmath69 for a first - order transition .",
    "these are all infinite volume results .",
    "while the @xmath64 values associated with a crossover or a first - order transition are approached slowly with increasing volume close to the second - order transition , the infinite volume value is approached rapidly with increasing volume , at the transition .",
    "as @xmath70 , @xmath64 approaches its first - order value , while as @xmath71 @xmath64 approaches its crossover value .",
    "the rate at which these values are approached as one goes away from the transition increases with increasing volume .",
    "the curves for different volumes will cross very close to the phase transition , yielding both estimates for @xmath64 and hence of the universality class of this critical point , and of @xmath50 for this transition .",
    "our preliminary results for all 3 lattice sizes are given in figure  [ fig : binder ] .",
    "although these measurements are very noisy , the curves for the 3 lattice sizes appear to cross at @xmath72 .",
    "the value at which they cross is uncertain enough to accommodate both @xmath7 and tricritical behaviour .    perhaps the best way to estimate",
    "the position of the phase transition is from the peaks of the susceptibilities . for any observable @xmath73",
    "the corresponding susceptibility is defined by @xmath74 we use ferrenberg - swendsen interpolation to locate the peak of the susceptibilities for the plaquette , the wilson line and @xmath75 .",
    "the advantage of this for determining @xmath50 is that these peaks give estimates for the position of the transition on a finite volume , where it is merely a crossover .",
    "these @xmath50 estimates are relatively insensitive to the lattice volume , which will make any attempt to extrapolate to infinite volume somewhat easier . for the @xmath5 lattice",
    "we estimate @xmath76 while for the @xmath4 lattice we get @xmath77 , by this method .",
    "lattice qcd , where the fermion action is modified to include a chiral 4-fermion term shows promise for determining the precise nature of the @xmath29 finite temperature phase transition for massless quarks , by determining the critical exponents of this transition .",
    "the ability to work at and near @xmath31 seems essential for extracting this critical behaviour . with conventional actions ,",
    "the penalties for running at quark masses small enough to predict the chiral limit appear insurmountable , at least in the near future . to see",
    "this one needs only to look at the best ` data ' currently available from simulations using state - of - the - art actions which do not permit using @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "we have already seen that simulations with @xmath78 lattices are plagued by finite lattice artifacts as was implicit in the analyses using standard actions .",
    "we are therefore using lattices with @xmath2 .",
    "preliminary fits to the @xmath5 data yield critical exponent @xmath60 , consistent with the expected @xmath7 or @xmath6 values .",
    "however , with an error this large , one can not preclude tricritical or mean - field behaviour .",
    "more statistics are needed as well as reliable extrapolations to infinite volume .",
    "use of ferrenberg - swendsen interpolation , thus making more use of the limited ` data ' we do have , is one way of effectively increasing our statistics .",
    "the scaling window is very narrow @xmath79 , which is the principal reason why extrapolating from finite quark mass is extremely difficult .",
    "we are able to pinpoint the critical point from the peaks in the susceptibilities for the various observables .",
    "this method yields the best estimate of this position for a given lattice size and does not rely on some potentially unreliable infinite volume extrapolation .",
    "since the volume dependence of @xmath50 determined this way is minimal , this is probably also the best method for determining @xmath50 in the infinite volume limit .",
    "binder cumulants show promise for determining the position and nature of the phase transition . however , these require much more statistics than we have obtained and possibly more than we can hope to obtain .",
    "they have the advantage that they make use of the chiral condensate as measured on the finite lattice , despite the fact that it averages to zero at all @xmath39s .",
    "such are the advantages of fluctuation quantities",
    ".    we will ultimately measure other critical exponents .",
    "one such , namely @xmath80 , measures the mass dependence of the condensate at @xmath50 .",
    "hence this will require simulations at small but finite quark mass .",
    "we are currently performing simulations with this action on zero temperature lattices .",
    "these simulations will calculate the spectrum of light hadrons , which should indicate the utility of this action for problems other than qcd thermodynamics , for which the ability to simulate at zero or physical quark masses is also important .",
