    "in 1939 , einstein ( @xcite ) solved the field equations of general relativity to describe a cluster of particles moving in circular orbits about the centre of the system .",
    "the static and spherically symmetric solution was supported by a balance between gravity and the centrifugal force due to the angular momentum of the particles .",
    "these einstein clusters have been studied extensively .",
    "gilbert @xcite investigated their stability , florides @xcite took one as a model for the interior of a star and comer and katz @xcite used them as a model of a heat bath for a black hole . a natural generalization is to consider a similar system which evolves dynamically .",
    "this was first considered by datta @xcite , who limited his discussion to the case in which all the particles have the same angular momentum .",
    "bondi @xcite generalized datta s model to allow each shell of particles to have a different angular momentum , and discussed the types of behaviour that might occur .",
    "the same model was discussed by evans @xcite , who investigated the system for both thin heavy shells of particles , and a cloud of dust .",
    "none of these authors obtained a general solution for the metric of the spacetime .",
    "datta obtained the solution for the simple case in which the angular momentum is the same for each shell .",
    "bondi considered matching the general solution to an external schwarzschild metric , but did not find any additional solutions .",
    "evans discussed how the system would evolve from initial data , but again did not obtain any solutions .    in recent years",
    ", much work has been done on gravitational collapse , as an investigation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( see @xcite for a recent review and references therein ) . in this context , magli @xcite examined this model again .",
    "he discussed a general class of spherically symmetric solutions to einstein s equations with vanishing radial pressure .",
    "he was able to solve for the metric in terms of mass - area coordinates @xcite , based on the method used for charged dust collapse by ori @xcite .",
    "using his solution , harada @xcite investigated naked singularity formation in the model , and gave a particular case in which the metric could be written in terms of elementary functions .",
    "this special case was investigated by harada @xcite and kudoh @xcite , and singularity formation in the general case was examined further by jhingan and magli @xcite .",
    "we tackle this problem in a new way , solving for the metric in terms of the time experienced by the dust particles composing the universe .",
    "the mass - area approach has the advantage that the solution reduces to a single integral which is in terms of the coordinates used .",
    "this is not true in general in the new approach .",
    "however , the mass - area solution makes the structure of spacetime unclear , since both these coordinates can be spacelike in general",
    ". moreover , such coordinates are only appropriate to monotonic collapse or expansion , in which the area can be used as a time coordinate .",
    "the mass - proper time solution is better suited to studies of model universes , which may have phases of both expansion and collapse , and it is physical , since the time coordinate is understandable , as the time experienced by the dust .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the model and derive the equations . in section 3",
    ", we solve the equations , present a general discussion of the types of solution , and describe the relation to einstein clusters . in section 4 , we present some examples .",
    "section 5 gives our conclusions .",
    "the spacetime is composed of a large number of dust particles , which can move radially , and have angular momentum about the origin .",
    "spherical symmetry is assumed , so that all quantities are functions only of the time and the radial coordinate . to produce this symmetry , at each point there must be a large number of particles , moving with the same angular momentum , but in every tangential direction .",
    "a comoving radial coordinate , @xmath1 , is used , i.e. particles remain on surfaces @xmath6 for all time .",
    "the general spherically symmetric metric is given by the ansatz :    @xmath7    we assume that the dust only interacts with itself gravitationally , so that each dust particle moves on a geodesic of the spacetime . as a consequence of the geodesic equations , the angular momentum , @xmath8 is a constant for each particle ( where @xmath2 denotes the proper time for the particle ) .",
    "spherical symmetry requires that @xmath9 be the same for each particle on a given shell , i.e. @xmath10 only .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for dust is @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the proper density of the dust and @xmath13 is the 4-velocity .",
    "this would be @xmath14 for this spacetime if the 4-velocity of the dust was well - defined .",
    "however , particles are moving in all tangential directions at each point , and so the 4-velocity is not single valued .",
    "but , as the particles are assumed not to interact , the overall energy - momentum tensor can be taken as a sum of the individual contributions over all the particles @xmath15 .",
    "the choice of comoving coordinates makes the radial pressure @xmath16 vanish ( @xmath17=0 ) .",
    "spherical symmetry of the overall system requires the two tangential pressures to be equal @xmath18 . for a single dust particle , @xmath19 . from the geodesic equations , @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath9 is conserved , we have @xmath21 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath22 to @xmath23 is the same for every particle on a shell , and so the energy momentum tensor is given by @xmath24    @xmath25 is the energy density , @xmath26 , which includes a contribution from the kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "conservation of the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath27 , yields the two non - trivial equations : @xmath28 in these , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using the convention @xmath31 , @xmath32 for the einstein curvature tensor and the identification @xmath33 , the non - trivial einstein equations are given by : @xmath34",

    "the use of @xmath4 instead of @xmath51 makes this identification more explicit .",
    "substitution of ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) into ( [ eq11 ] ) and integration gives :    @xmath52    the constant of integration has been taken to be @xmath53 .",
    "on substitution of ( [ eq13 ] ) , ( [ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) into ( [ eq10 ] ) we obtain @xmath54    @xmath3 is the misner - sharp mass @xcite , which is conserved for spherical systems with vanishing radial pressure .",
    "this is not the energy density summed over all shells .",
    "for that , the factor @xmath55 must be included in the integral to give the correct volume element .",
    "the equations ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) are coupled equations for the two remaining unknown functions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "they can not be solved explicitly in the coordinates @xmath58 and @xmath1 .",
    "magli @xcite found a solution by using mass - area coordinates , that is @xmath59 and @xmath1 .",
    "we shall obtain a solution in terms of a different time coordinate .",
    "there are two times besides @xmath58 relevant to this problem .",
    "the time experienced by an observer at rest on a shell obeys @xmath60 .",
    "the equation of motion in @xmath61 is therefore identical to ( [ eq15 ] ) , with the first term replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "alternatively , there is the proper time experienced by a dust particle , @xmath2 , which obeys    @xmath63    on changing coordinates from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , equation ( [ eq15 ] ) becomes :    @xmath66    this equation is exactly the equation of motion of a test particle with angular momentum @xmath9 and energy @xmath67 in a vacuum schwarzschild metric of mass @xmath68 .",
    "this result is a consequence of the assumption that the dust particles follow geodesic paths , and justifies the identification of @xmath69 as the energy and @xmath68 as the mass made earlier .    equation ( [ eq21 ] ) may be integrated , keeping @xmath1 constant :    @xmath70    @xmath5 is a constant of integration .",
    "the function @xmath71 is given explicitly by ( [ eq21 ] ) , since @xmath72 is known as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath1 . in the case @xmath73 , the integral is an elliptic integral . for non zero @xmath43",
    "the integral is hyperelliptic .",
    "@xmath74 gives the function @xmath75 on inversion .",

    ", we first differentiate ( [ eq20 ] ) with respect to @xmath1 and then change the order of partial derivatives , obtaining an expression for @xmath83 .",
    "this may be written as an equation for @xmath84 by noting @xmath85 the resulting equation has an integrating factor @xmath86 , giving the result :    @xmath87    again , this is an elliptic integral if @xmath73 and hyperelliptic otherwise .",
    "it is closely related to the integral for @xmath75 .",
    "evaluation of the integral , ( [ eq28 ] ) includes a constant of integration , @xmath88 say .",
    "this defines the origin of proper time , which may be different on different shells .",
    "this function is eliminated by choosing a common origin of time for all shells , i.e. at some time , say @xmath89 , we set @xmath90 for all @xmath1 . knowing the distribution of matter at that time , @xmath91 , the equation @xmath92 with @xmath93 determines @xmath88 .",
    "this does not remove any generality from the problem , as the proper time is only defined locally for a shell .",

    "the evolution of the system depends on the four free functions @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath9 and @xmath100 .",
    "one of these corresponds to a choice of the shell label , @xmath1 .",
    "the others are fixed by the initial density , kinetic energy and angular momentum of the dust .",

    "the signs of @xmath486 indicate how many times the potential cuts the @xmath59-axis .",

    "the transition between the various shapes occurs when the potential has a point of inflection , i.e. when @xmath355 has a repeated 0 .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ eq30 ] ) and requiring @xmath488 to have a double zero at @xmath460 , gives the condition that @xmath489 , where @xmath357 , @xmath358 and @xmath360 is given by : @xmath490 this repeated root is at @xmath491 .",
    "the functions @xmath492 are defined only for @xmath493 , so that the square root in ( [ app11 ] ) is real .",
