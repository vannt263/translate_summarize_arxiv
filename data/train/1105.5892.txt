    "in the last decade , configuration mixing has become a standard tool in the energy density functional approach both to restore symmetries and to provide a competitive theory for nuclear spectroscopy . with the possibility to perform systematic and precise studies , detailed analysis of mr - edf",
    "have been made , pointing out some questionable aspects related to the way mr - edf is constructed @xcite .",
    "below , we further investigate the mr - edf applied to particle number restoration .",
    "the hamiltonian case is first discussed as well as some specific features that will be useful for the edf case .",
    "starting from a two - body hamiltonian , written here as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denote the anti - symmetric two - body interaction matrix elements , pairing can be treated approximately by minimizing the energy in the space of quasi - particle vacua . for a given quasi - particle reference state of the special bogolyubov type , denoted by @xmath2 ,",
    "the energy writes @xmath3 = & & { e}_{sr } \\left [ \\rho , \\kappa , \\kappa^ * \\right ] =   \\sum_{i } t_{ii } \\rho_{ii}+    \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i , j } \\overline{v}_{ijij}^ { }   \\rho_{ii}\\rho_{jj }    + \\frac{1}{4 }   \\sum_{i , j } \\overline{v}_{i\\bar\\imath j\\bar\\jmath } ^ { } \\kappa_{i \\bar\\imath } ^ * \\kappa_{j \\bar\\jmath } \\",

    "here @xmath13 denotes the gauge angle , whereas @xmath14 refers to the state @xmath2 rotated in gauge space . for @xmath15 ,",
    "an expression is obtained for the projected energy : @xmath16 \\equiv    \\int_{0}^{2\\pi }   d\\varphi \\ , { e}_{sr } \\left [ \\rho^{0\\varphi } , \\kappa^{0\\varphi } ,   { \\kappa^{\\varphi 0 } } ^\\star \\right ]     { \\cal n}_n ( { 0 , \\varphi } ) \\ , .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an equivalent form of the projected energy @xmath18 can directly be found by taking the expectation value of @xmath19 with the projected state , leading to : @xmath20 & = &   \\frac{\\langle   \\psi_n | h | \\psi _ { n } \\rangle } { \\langle   \\psi_n | \\psi _ { n } \\rangle } =     \\sum_{ij } t_{ij } \\ ,   \\frac{\\langle   \\psi_n |     a^\\dagger_i \\",

    ". \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { e}_{n } \\left [ \\rho^n , r^n \\right ] =      \\sum_{ij } t_{ij } \\ ,   \\rho^n_{ij }   + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{ijkl } \\bar{v}_{ijkl }    r^n_{kl , ij}. \\label{eq : onetwo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , we see that the projected energy can be considered either as a functional of the transition densities ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ekernel ] ) ) or as a functional of the one- and two - body density matrices ( called hereafter obdm and tbdm ) of the projected state ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : onetwo ] ) ) .",
    "the two formulations are strictly equivalent and can be connected by expressing the density matrices in terms of the gauge angles as : @xmath21 indeed , starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ekernel ] ) and combining the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 terms ( eq . [ eq : denssrhamil ] ) , one can indeed directly recognize the components of the tbdm .",
    "the formulation of broken symmetry and its restoration in the nuclear edf closely follows the hamiltonian case . in a first step ,",
    "called single - reference edf ( sr - edf ) , an energy written as a functional of an auxiliary quasi - particle state is given .",
    "restricting here to bilinear functional based on effective interactions , it can be written as @xmath24 = & & \\mathcal{e}_{sr } \\left [ \\rho , \\kappa , \\kappa^ * \\right ] =   \\sum_{i } t_{ii } \\rho_{ii}+ \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i , j } \\overline{v}_{ijij}^{\\rho \\rho }   \\rho_{ii}\\rho_{jj }    + \\frac{1}{4 }    \\sum_{i , j } \\overline{v}_{i\\bar\\imath j\\bar\\jmath } ^{\\kappa \\kappa } \\kappa_{i \\bar\\imath } ^ * \\kappa_{j \\bar\\jmath } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : denssr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the edf theory differs from the hamiltonian case by the appearance of effective vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the mean - field and pairing channels .",
    "in particular , these vertices generally ( i ) differ from each other , ( ii ) might not be fully antisymmetric , ( iii ) might be density dependent .    these differences are at the heart of problems occurring when trying to extend sr - edf theory to the multi - reference edf framework .",
    "standard approach to perform mr - edf consists in using equation ( [ eq : ekernel ] ) where @xmath27 is replaced by its functional counterpart @xmath28 .",
    "however , this direct mapping has led to inconsistencies : first , mr - edf can lead to jumps and/or divergences in the energy @xcite .",
    "this problem originates in the strategy used to construct mr - edf and requires a specific regularization @xcite that is possible only for specific density dependence of the energy .",
    "secondly , the use of density dependent term , that has been so successful in sr - edf is at the origin of technical and conceptual difficulties .",
    "which density should be used in the effective kernels still needs to be clarified @xcite . finally , the direct application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ekernel ] ) or any equivalent for other projection does not insure in the edf case the proper behavior of the energy with respect to the symmetry transformation @xcite . none of these problems occur in the hamiltonian case .",
    "this is clearly shown by expression ( [ eq : onetwo ] ) , noting that projected densities have all the required properties ( symmetry transformation , anti - symmetrization , non - divergence and regularity ... ) .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to see if and under which conditions , an equation similar to ( [ eq : onetwo ] ) can be obtained starting from the mr - edf approach .",
    "we have recently shown @xcite , that starting with [ a ] a bilinear functional , [ b ] with density independent interaction and [ c ] a slight modification of the renormalization proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mr - edf obtained by gauge angle integration is equivalent to a functional of the projected state densities written as : @xmath29 & = & \\sum_{i } t_{ii } n^n_i   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i , j , j\\neq \\bar\\imath } \\overline{v}_{ijij}^{\\rho \\rho }    r^n_{ijij }   + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{i \\neq j , j\\neq \\bar\\imath } \\overline{v}_{i\\bar\\imath j\\bar\\jmath } ^{\\kappa \\kappa }   r^n_{j \\bar\\jmath   i\\bar\\imath   }    \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i } \\overline{v}_{i\\bar\\imath   i \\bar\\imath } ^{\\rho \\rho }   n^n_i n^n_i   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum_{i}\\overline{v}_{i\\bar\\imath i\\bar\\imath } ^{\\kappa \\kappa }   n^n_i ( 1 - n^n_i )   \\ ,   ,    \\label{eq : edftotprojcor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 denotes the occupation numbers of @xmath31 .",
    "this expression clearly shows that conditions [ a - c ] insure a well behaved functional as far as the particle number projection is concerned .",
    "it also shows that the mr - edf can eventually be interpreted as a functional of densities constructed from an auxiliary state @xmath31 which leads to the functional sequence : @xmath32 the direct use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : edftotprojcor ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ekernel ] ) is possible and will lead to result identical to mr - edf when the regularization is applicable .",
    "this formulation where breaking and restoration are accounted for simultaneously will be called hereafter symmetry - conserving edf ( sc - edf ) .",
    "sc - edf can be used with density dependent interaction , including dependence in non - integer powers of the density , and can be formulated as a consistent extension of the sr - edf approach .",
    "then , the density entering in the effective vertices becomes the density of the projected state .",
    "an illustration of the sc - edf is shown in figure [ fig:1mbdc ] for a functional containing non - integer powers of the density .",
    "the mr - edf results where no regularization is possible @xcite is also shown as a reference .",
    "( color online ) particle - number restored deformation energy surface of @xmath33o calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : edftotprojcor ] ) when the sly4 effective interaction is used in the particle - hole channel",
    ". the dashed line corresponds to the non - regularized mr - edf result directly obtained by gauge angle integration using 199 points in the discretization ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ekernel ] ) ) .",
    "the filled circles correspond to the result obtained using the symmetry - conserved edf based on equation ( [ eq : edftotprojcor ] ) . ]",
    "the mr - edf approach applied to particle number projection has been further analyzed here .",
    "guided by the hamiltonian case , we show that , under certain conditions , this approach can be formulated as a functional theory of the projected one- and two - body density matrices .",
    "this alternative formulation called symmetry conserving - edf can eventually be applied to functional where the mr - edf is ill defined .",
    "note finally that , it has also been shown recently that the two - body density matrix of the projected is a functional of the one - body density matrix @xcite .",
