    "drug - induced liver injury ( dili ) is a major public health and industrial issue that has concerned clinicians for the past 50 years.@xcite reports that many drugs for a diverse range of diseases were either removed from the market or rejected at the pre - marketing stage because of severe dili ( e.g. ,  iproniazid , ticrynafen , benoxaprofen , bromfenac , troglitazone , nefazodone , etc.).therefore , signals of a drug s potential for dili and early detection can help to improve the evaluation of drugs and aid pharmaceutical companies in their decision making .",
    "however , in most clinical trials of hepatotoxic drugs , evidence of hepatotoxicity is very rare and although the pattern of injury can vary , there are no pathognomonic findings that make diagnosis of dili certain , even upon liver biopsy.indeed , most of the drugs withdrawn from the market for hepatotoxicity , fall mainly in the post - marketing category , and have caused death or transplantation at frequencies of less than 1 per 10000 people that have been administered the drug .    although the mechanism that causes dili is not fully understood yet , the procedure under which its clinical assessment is performed stems from zimmerman s observation that hepatocellular injury sufficient to impair bilirubin excretion is a revealing indicator of dili ( zimmerman 1978 , 1999 ) , also informally known as hy s law .  in other words , a finding of _ alanine aminotransferase _",
    "( alt ) elevation , usually substantial and greater than thrice the upper limit of the normal of alt ( uln@xmath0 ) , seen concurrently with _ bilirubin _ ( tbl )",
    "greater than twice the upper limit of the normal of tbl ( uln@xmath1 ) , identifies a drug likely to cause severe dili ( fatal or requiring transplant ) .",
    "moreover , these elevations should not be attributed to any other cause of injury , such as other drugs , and _ alkaline phosphatase _ ( alp ) should not be greatly elevated so as to explain tbl s elevation .",
    "@xcite identified the assessment of dili as a multivariate extreme value problem and using the @xcite modelling approach , analysed liver - related laboratory data .",
    "the use of the @xcite model in this context is supported by the flexibility of the model to allow a broad class of dependence structures and the possibility to describe the probabilistic behaviour of a random vector which is extreme in at least one margin .  despite its strong modelling potential , complications in terms of parameter identifiability problems and invalid inferences",
    "are experienced with the original modelling procedure of @xcite.@xcite provided missing constraints for the parameter space of the @xcite model that are aimed to overcome these complications .",
    "the data we consider in this study relates to observed liver - related variables from a sample of 606 patients who were issued a drug that has been linked to liver injury in a phase 3 clinical trial and can be found in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "the patients were categorised into 4 different dose levels in a randomised , parallel group , double blind phase 3 clinical study .",
    "our main question in this paper about the data is whether they support evidence of toxicity with increasing dose .",
    "this signal would be justified by a significant positive probability of post - baseline alt and tbl being greater than @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "however , insufficient trial duration and the small sample sizes encountered in most such applications may lead to estimated zero probabilities of dili for all doses .",
    "this would stem from the non - occurrence of joint alt and tbl elevations or from inaccurate extrapolation due to the limited source of information .",
    "therefore , other patterns that could indicate or be triggered by dili would be helpful and here we consider an alternative approach for assessing evidence of altered liver behaviour .",
    "the current understanding of the biology that underpins hy s law , is that liver cells leak alt into the blood as they are damaged . as the amount of damage increases , the amount of alt increases , and so the liver begins to lose its capacity to clear tbl .",
    "subsequently , tbl is also expected to start to increase . at levels of damage that do not affect liver",
    "s ability to clear tbl , dependence is not expected .",
    "hence , given that the drug has increasing toxicity with dose , we expect a natural ordering in the joint tail area of alt and tbl .",
    "this pattern of tail ordering is the main focus of this paper and is used to aid inference as well as to improve estimation efficiency in the modelling procedure of dili .",

    "the letters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent , in increasing order , the amount of the dose . [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "table  [ tab : ratio_rmse ] shows the ratio of the monte carlo root mean square error , of the conditional quantile estimates obtained from the three copula models .",
    "an increase in efficiency under the imposition of the constrained models ad and so is observed for nearly all conditional quantile estimates in the asymptotically independent models .",
    "the highest reduction in rmse is achieved by the so model in the inverted logistic copula , a feature which is also consistent with the higher percentage of change in estimates as shown in table  [ tab : perc ] .",
    "the conclusion for the asymptotically independent models is that the efficiency of the conditional quantile estimates is , in decreasing order , so , ad and ht .",
    "regarding the asymptotically dependent logistic copula , constrained models appear to be less efficient than the ht model and the efficiency of the conditional quantile estimates is , in decreasing order , ht , ad and so .",
    "the data that we consider in this study relates to a sample of 606 patients that were issued a drug linked to liver injury in a randomised , parallel group , double blind phase 3 clinical study .",
    "alt and tbl measurements were collected from all patients at baseline ( prior to treatment ) and post - baseline ( after 6 weeks of treatment ) periods .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the @xmath10-th baseline and post - baseline laboratory variable respectively , measured at dose @xmath11 and @xmath7 .",
    "we use @xmath12 to denote the alt and tbl , respectively .    instead of working with the raw data ,",
    "the @xcite transformation is applied initially to stabilise the heterogeneity observed in the samples .  for this dataset",
    "we apply the log - transformation and we denote the transformed data by @xmath13 and @xmath14.consequently , we use a robust linear regression model of the log - post - baseline on the log - baseline variable to adjust for the baseline effect , i.e. in its simplest form , the robust linear regression of @xmath15 on @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a zero mean error random variable .  here",
    "we use median quantile regression @xcite which is equivalent to assuming that the error random variable @xmath19 follows the laplace distribution with zero location constant scale parameters @xcite .",
    "the parameter estimates @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 , were found to be all significantly different from 0 and equal to @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , all indicating positive association of post - baseline with baseline .",
    "our approach is based on the basic model structure of @xcite , i.e. the extremal dependence of @xmath28 is estimated from the @xcite conditional dependence model whereas the log - baseline variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 are modelled independently for each dose .  under the assumption of independence between @xmath19 and @xmath16 simulated samples of the post - baseline variables can be generated .  in this example , the maximum spearman s correlation observed was 0.10 and corresponds to the pair @xmath31 and @xmath32 , whereas all other combinations gave values lower than 0.07 .",
    "the exact procedure of the simulation is straightforward , i.e. residual and baseline samples are generated from their models and are combined in equation  ( [ eq : qreg ] ) , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 replaced by their corresponding maximum likelihood estimates , to produce simulated samples for the log - post - baseline variable @xmath15 .",
    "the simulated sample is then back - transformed to its original scale using the inverse box - cox transformation .",
    "the key differences between our modelling procedure and @xcite are related to the modelling of the baseline and the estimation of the conditional dependence model parameters.firstly , for each baseline variable we implement the univariate semi - parametric model of @xcite as described in section  [ sec : laptrans ] by equation  ( [ eq : coletawn ] ) whereas @xcite use the empirical distribution function .",
    "our motivation for modelling the tail of the baseline variable stems from the fact that it is likely to observe higher baseline alt and tbl in the population ( post - marketing period ) than in the clinical trial ( pre - marketing period ) .  therefore , tail modelling of the baseline is key to the simulation process as it incorporates a natural source of extremity through model - based extrapolation .",
    "results from the univariate analysis are not presented in this paper but similar analyses can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    in section  [ sec : appht ] we test and subsequently select the stochastic ordering model developed in section [ sec : stochorder ] .",
    "the effect of the ordering constraints is illustrated via estimates of conditional quantiles for all doses and results are compared with the unconstrained estimates obtained from the ht model .",
    "we proceed to the prediction of the probability of extreme joint elevations by simulating post - baseline laboratory data of hypothetical populations of size @xmath35 using the fitted marginal and conditional dependence models .",
    "the assessment of the uncertainty of the estimates of extreme quantities of interest is performed via the bootstrap procedure .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the transformed , with respect to equation ( [ eq : laplace ] ) , residuals @xmath38 and @xmath39 for each dose @xmath40 .",
    "figure  [ fig : data ] shows the bivariate scatterplots of @xmath37 against @xmath36 for all dose levels .",
    "the tail dependence between the residual alt and tbl variables appears to be very weak for all dose levels and a direct conclusion regarding the stochastic ordering effect can not be made on the basis of figure  [ fig : data ] .",
    "this is also justified by the estimated @xmath41 and @xmath42 measures of tail dependence @xcite which are 0 for all doses .    to assess the ordering assumption",
    ", we use the likelihood ratio criterion described in section  [ sec : hypothesis ] , and test at the significance level of 5% , the hypotheses of ordered dose dependence in the conditional distributions of alt and tbl given that tbl and alt exceed a large threshold @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "for the so model we selected a range of values @xmath43 above 5 , the @xmath44 quantile of the laplace distribution .",
    "similar results where obtained from all thresholds and here we report the output for @xmath45 . figure  [ fig : lrt ] shows the simulated distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic under the null hypothesis of ordered dependence . both histograms imply that we can not reject the null hypothesis at 5% with stronger evidence for the distribution of tbl given large alt .",
    "the p - values are approximately 0.43 and 0.15 , respectively .",
    "the effect of constraining the parameter space to impose the stochastic ordering assumption between all dose levels is shown in figure [ fig : condquantiles ] via the conditional quantile estimates obtained from the so model .",
    "a weak lack of ordering appears from the estimated conditional quantiles of tbl given alt from the ht model as shown in figure  [ fig : condquantiles ] in the standard laplace scale .",
    "the estimates of the median conditional quantiles from the ht model are ordered above approximately the conditioning level @xmath46 whereas the minimum and maximum conditional quantile estimates exhibit a lack of ordering for the majority of the conditioning levels .",
    "the imposition of the ordering constraints induces changes in all conditional quantile estimates which satisfy the ordering assumption above the conditioning level @xmath47 .",
    "the most important change in the quantile estimates is observed for dose @xmath4 which are considerably smaller than the ht estimates , when @xmath48 .",
    "the focus is placed now on the prediction of joint elevations of alt and tbl .",
    "as stated by @xcite and mentioned earlier in section  [ sec : intro ] , dili is associated with alt and tbl exceeding the 3@xmath49uln@xmath0 and 2@xmath49uln@xmath1 respectively . for alt ,",
    "the uln is taken to be 36 units / litre and for tbl is 21 @xmath50mol / litre .",
    "let @xmath51 be the joint survival probability of @xmath52 at dose level @xmath11 or @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath53 to estimate the survival probability  ( [ eq : survprobs ] ) we follow the approach of @xcite , also mentioned earlier in section  [ sec : introapp ] and simulate @xmath54 post - baseline samples .",
    "for each dose level , @xmath55 baseline samples are generated from the semi - parametric model  ( [ eq : coletawn ] ) and are subsequently combined with @xmath55 generated residual samples from the so constrained @xcite model in equation  ( [ eq : qreg ] ) , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 replaced by their corresponding maximum likelihood estimates , to produce simulated samples for the log - post - baseline variable @xmath15 .",
    "the simulated sample is then back - transformed to its original scale and the survival probability  ( [ eq : survprobs ] ) is estimated empirically . to assess the uncertainty of the estimates , this procedure is repeated @xmath56 times and @xmath57 equal - tail confidence intervals",
    "are obtained from the bootstrap distribution of each estimate .",
    "figure  [ fig : predictions ] shows the estimated survival probabilities @xmath51 for @xmath58 and variable @xmath59 . for comparisons ,",
    "estimates are reported from the so and ht models .",
    "the imposition of the constraints induces changes in all estimates .",
    "in particular , the survival probability estimates from the so model are lower than the ht model for all doses , especially in the region @xmath60 .",
    "this behaviour also implies changes in the upper tail and in the joint region of dili , i.e. when @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "as identified by @xcite , liver toxicity can be assessed by the joint extremes of alt and tbl . however , due to the limited sample size and the insufficient duration of the clinical trial ( 6 weeks only ) , extrapolation to the tail area that identifies dili is not feasible for the laboratory data that have been analysed in this paper .",
    "@xcite found some dose response relationship for the probability of joint extreme elevations but attributed this pattern to the large number of cases with @xmath63 in the higher dose groups rather than an effect on tbl or stronger extremal dependence . here ,",
    "we have developed methodology for ordered tail dependence across doses , a pattern that is potentially triggered by toxicity but not formally assessed by @xcite .",
    "based on current biological understanding , we view this pattern as an alternative measure of altered liver behaviour and our aim in this analysis is to formally test ordered dependence in the joint tail area of baseline - adjusted alt and tbl .",
    "our model formulation builds on @xcite model and extends the @xcite conditional approach , to account for stochastic ordering in the tails for assessing dili in multiple dose trials .",
    "our approach consists of bounding conditional distribution functions through additional constraints on the parameter space of @xcite model .",
    "these constraints are used to construct likelihood ratio tests which allow model selection and potential efficiency gains in estimation as shown mainly by our simulations for asymptotically independent models .",
    "our main finding that complements @xcite analysis is statistical evidence of ordered tail dependence across doses which we view as a signal of altered liver behaviour .",
    "our results and conclusions predict slightly higher probabilities of extreme elevations than those predicted originally by @xcite but of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this is possibly a consequence of the modelling of baseline variables which allows extrapolation in the marginal tails but could also be attributed to the different robust regression approach used here to adjust the baseline effect . also , the predicted survival curves indicate ordering from both unconstrained and constrained modelling approaches . this feature stems primarily from the conditional dependence model estimates of baseline",
    "adjusted alt and tbl which show ordering for a range of quantiles .",
    "last , there are some caveats with the proposed ordering effect used as a measure of altered liver behaviour , especially when considering highly toxic drugs for prolonged periods .",
    "if much damage has been done so that there is no alt left to leak into the blood , we would expect alt to come back down but tbl to remain high .",
    "the proposed methodology though could still be used to monitor such patterns in longitudinal trials via tests of dose ordering at consecutive time points .",
