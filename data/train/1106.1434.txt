    "the radial velocity ( rv ) method is still the dominant source of confirmed exoplanets , although the transit technique is rapidly producing planet detections .",
    "the advantage of transiting planets is that they allow additional characterization of the planet , namely the radius and hence the density . for planets transiting bright stars , atmospheric studies",
    "may be undertaken , as was the case for hd  189733b @xcite and hd  149026b @xcite .",
    "however , most of the planets detected using transits orbit relatively faint host stars , making them inaccessible to such investigations .",
    "transit detections are also biased towards short periods due to the geometric transit probability @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) is to ameliorate these biases through photometric monitoring of known rv planets at improved times of predicted transits @xcite .",
    "the first planet candidate to be detected with the radial velocity technique orbits the star hd  114762 , a late f dwarf .",
    "the companion was discovered by @xcite who reported the minimum mass as @xmath4 .",
    "this discovery was confirmed by @xcite and a search for transits by @xcite ruled out transit depths greater than 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite used high - resolution spectroscopy to measure the projected rotational velocity @xmath5 and concluded that the inclination of the companion is likely to be low , possibly rendering the companion above the limit for deuterium fusion .",
    "there is still uncertainty as to the true inclination of the companion , particularly with the large range of spin - orbit misalignments which can occur @xcite .",
    "further long - term photometry by @xcite has found the host star to be photometrically stable in the @xmath6 band to 0.001 magnitudes .    here",
    "we present our complete rv dataset from lick observatory that has a time baseline of 19 years .",
    "the keplerian analyses of these data is used to produce a revised orbital solution that further refines the period for transit studies and rules out the presence of additional companions within the system .",
    "we also present 23 years of high - precision photometry from the t2 0.25  m and the t10 0.8  m automatic photoelectric telescopes ( apts ) at fairborn observatory .",
    "the most recent data were acquired with the t10 apt whose 1@xmath7 uncertainty of 0.0012 mag for a single observations is easily sufficient to find or to rule out transits with a predicted depth of @xmath8% .",
    "the rv data were acquired with the 3.0 m shane telescope and the hamilton echelle spectrograph at lick observatory .",
    "the data comprise 74 measurements that range from 1990 march through 2009 february and are shown in table [ rvs ] . of these ,",
    "46 were extracted from the same spectra as used by @xcite .",
    "however , the lick data reduction pipeline undergoes frequent refinement and so each reduction is of superior quality to previously published measurements extracted from those spectra .",
    "as data accumulates , the code adaptively reassesses the relative weights of portions of the spectra based upon such factors as contamination by weak telluric lines or bad pixels .",
    "the fourth column in table [ rvs ] shows the dewar number which was used with the observation , the relevance being the different ccd response characteristics which can occur between dewars .",
    "this is accounted for in the keplerian orbital fitting described below .",

    "thus this trend is unlikely to be due to any additional companions within the system .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite who exclude companions with masses greater than 66  @xmath50 at orbital radii of 3162674  au .",
    "note that @xcite detect a stellar companion to hd  114762 , further characterized by @xcite , at an angular separation of 3.3(180  au ) .",
    "this companion could feasibly cause the observed trend , but the significance level is too low for us to claim such a detection .",
    "we therefore adopt the solution without the trend included , shown in figure [ rv ] .",
    "the fit required four additional free parameters due to the offsets induced by the changing of the detector dewars .",

    "the uncertainty in the period for the presented orbital solution is a factor of 4 improvement over the previous solution by @xcite and allows a more robust transit search to be carried out .",
    "from the stellar and planetary properties listed in tables [ stellar ] and [ planet ] , we derive a planetary radius of @xmath60 using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "this results in a predicted transit duration of 0.49 days and a predicted transit depth of 0.91% .",
    "the uncertainty in the stellar mass / radius and subsequent uncertainty in the planetary mass / radius have a minor effect on the estimated transit duration but in no way affects the predicted transit mid - points since these are derived from the orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "based upon the revised orbital parameters , we computed a new transit ephemeris , applied in the following section .    as described by @xcite , the probability of a planetary transit is a strong function of both the eccentricity and the argument of periastron and is at a maximum when the periastron passage occurs close to the star - observer line of sight ( @xmath61 ) . the measured periastron argument for hd  114762b leads to an orbital configuration which favors a secondary eclipse rather than a primary transit .",
    "the transit probability based upon the parameters of table [ planet ] is 1.71% . for comparison",
    ", an equivalent circlular orbit would have a transit probability of 1.73% , but the same eccentricity with a periastron argument of @xmath62 would have a transit probability of 2.60% .",
    "as part of our long - term program to measure luminosity cycles in solar - type stars @xcite , we have acquired 23 consecutive years of photometric observations of hd  114762 with our t2 0.25  m and t10 0.80  m automatic photometric telescopes ( apts ) at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "the t2 apt used a photodiode detector to make differential measurements of stars through johnson @xmath63 filters .",
    "it collected 1989 nightly observations of hd  114762 during the 1989 through 2001 observing seasons .",
    "details concerning the data acquisition and reduction with this telescope can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the t10 apt has a two - channel photometer with a dichroic filter that separates the stromgren @xmath64 and @xmath65 photometric bands so they can be measured simultaneously by two emi 9124qb photomultiplier tubes .",
    "t10 collected 1137 nightly observations of hd  114762 during the 2002 through 2011 observing seasons .",
    "we have averaged the stromgren @xmath64 and @xmath65 band measurements from t10 to create a new @xmath66 `` passband '' that gives us improved precision .",
    "t10 operation is very similar to our t8 0.80  m apt , described in @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the t2 @xmath67 and t10 @xmath68 observations are shown in the left and right panels , respectively , of figure [ photometry ] . both data sets have been normalized so that all seasonal means agree with the mean of the first year , shown as the horizontal line in the two top panels .",
    "this removes any long - term brightness variability in the comparison stars and in hd  114762 itself ; corrections were typically a few tenths of a mmag .",
    "the top panels of figure [ photometry ] give for each apt the standard deviation of a single observation from the mean of the whole data set : 0.0122 mag and 0.0012 mag for t2 and t10 , respectively .",
    "both values are consistent with the precision of a single observation from each telescope , establishing the order of magnitude better precision of t10 over t2 .",
    "thus , we find that hd  114762 is constant to high precision on both night - to - night and year - to - year timescales .",
    "the middle panels of figure  [ photometry ] plot the two data sets with respect to the orbital phase of the companion , with phase 0.0 equal to the predicted time of mid - transit , @xmath69 , calculated from our revised orbital parameters in table [ planet ] .",
    "a least - squares sine fit to each data set gives semi - amplitudes of @xmath70 and @xmath71 mag .",
    "this confirms to very high precision the lack of stellar activity that might otherwise mimic periodic radial velocity variations in hd  114762 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the portion of the middle panels around phase 0.0 plotted with an expanded scale on the x - axis .",
    "the solid curve in each panel shows the predicted time ( @xmath69 ) , depth ( @xmath72 ) , and duration ( 0.49 days ) of a central transit , computed from the new orbital and planetary parameters derived above .",
    "the horizontal error bar below the transit shows the @xmath73 uncertainty in @xmath69 . with the present radial velocity data set in this paper",
    ", the uncertainty in @xmath69 is almost exactly equal to the transit duration . for the t2 observations in",
    "the bottom left panel of figure  [ photometry ] , the mean of the 12 in - transit observations agrees with the mean of the 1977 out - of - transit observations to @xmath74 mag , where the uncertainty is calculated by adding in quadrature the uncertainty of each of the two means .",
    "the uncertainty of the in - transit mean level dominates the total uncertainty because of the relatively fewer observations in transit than out .",
    "we have thus measured the difference between the in - transit and out - of - transit light levels to a precision of 0.0035 mag .",
    "if we assume the need for a @xmath75 event to ensure detection , the t2 observations can only rule out transits 0.0105 mag ( @xmath72 ) or deeper .",
    "therefore , the t2 observations have just enough sensitivity to detect the predicted transits but fail to do so .    for the much more precise t10 observations in the bottom right panel of figure  [ photometry ] ,",
    "the difference between the mean of the 26 in - transit observations and the mean of the 1111 out - of - transit observations is @xmath76 mag .",
    "therefore , transits with a @xmath77 depth of 0.0009 mag or more should be detectable .",
    "we round this to 0.001 mag and note that this limit applies only to full - duration , on - time events .",
    "we must make this distinction because of the non - random distribution of observations in the predicted transit window .",
    "we have only one observation very early in the first half of the transit window and 25 observations that span the second half .",
    "twenty - two of these 25 points came from a single night ( jd  2455326 ) when we monitored hd  114762 at a higher cadence .",
    "the worst case for the detection of full - duration transits occurs if they are 1 standard deviation early , i.e. , the window slides leftward one - half of its width . in this case , we loose all of the monitoring observations from the window and pick up only five nightly observations . with only @xmath78 the number of observations in the transit window , the @xmath77 transit depth limit doubles to 0.002 mag",
    ". thus , we can confidently rule out early or late full - duration transits to a limit of 0.002 mag .",
    "if the companion does transit as described , this is equivalent to ruling out radii of @xmath79 , or a density of 86  g@xmath80 . for comparison ,",
    "the density of the planet hat - p-20b , with a mass of @xmath81 and a radius of @xmath82 , is 13.8  g@xmath80 .",
    "it is also worth considering transits whose trajectory lies along a chord of the star approximately half the stellar diameter .",
    "an on - time transit along such a chord would contain half the number of observations , all during the second half of the shorter transit .",
    "thus , the detectable limit of an on - time transit with @xmath83 the full duration increases from 0.001 mag to @xmath84 mag .",
    "the worst case for detection of these shorter transits occurs if they are @xmath85 early . in this case",
    ", the transit window contains only one observation , namely , the first observation in the transit window in figure  [ photometry ] . the standard deviation of a single observation is 0.0012 mag , so the @xmath77 depth limit for this worst case is @xmath86 mag .",
    "but this worst case is very unlikely and happens only for @xmath69 exactly @xmath85 early .",
    "a little earlier or later , and the transit window begins picking up additional observations , and the depth limit becomes tighter .",
    "therefore , we can exclude transits with @xmath83 full duration to a limit of @xmath3 mag .",
    "similarly to that described above , this rules out transits of companions with densities lower than 47  g@xmath80 .",
    "the t10 observations in the lower - right panel illustrate the utility of the terms approach to finding transits of planets with intermediate orbital periods . of the 26 in - transit observations , only 4 of the nightly observations taken over 13 observing seasons fell at random within the transit window .",
    "the other 22 in - transit observations were acquired in a single night , 2010 may 10 ut , predicted from our updated orbit based on our new radial velocities acquired within the terms program .",
    "these new rv data refine the orbit of the first planetary candidate discovered to orbit a solar - type star .",
    "our analysis of lick spectra have greatly improved the estimated parameters of the host star . including a linear trend into the keplerian orbital fit does not significantly improve the rms scatter of the residuals and we thus find no evidence of any additional companions in the system . from the keplerian fit",
    "we produce a refined transit ephemeris onto which we have folded 23 years of precise photometry acquired with the apt at fairborn observatory .",
    "our photometric observations rule out on - time central transits to a limit of @xmath1 mag , early or late central transits to a limit of @xmath2 mag , and transits of @xmath83 full duration to a limit of @xmath3 mag .",
    "transits shorter than @xmath83 full duration are possible to hide in the gap in our transit coverage but are highly unlikely due to the low probability of the required inclination angles and the exact timing needed to fit the transit within the gap .",
    "the absence of planetary transits constrains the orbital inclination to be less than @xmath87 , which raises the minimum mass by a neglible amount . for the companion to transit undetected for these data ,",
    "the density would need to be in excess of 47  g@xmath80 , which is well outside the expected range for the planetary and brown dwarf regimes .",
    "the absolute confirmation of the planetary nature of the companion will likely need to await precision astrometric observations of this target to determine the orbital inclination .",
