    "consider secret key ( sk ) generation by a pair of terminals that observe independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",

    "the terminals communicate over a noiseless public channel of unlimited capacity , interactively in multiple rounds , to agree upon the value of the key .",
    "the key is required to be ( almost ) independent of the public communication .",
    "the maximum rate of such an sk , termed the secret key capacity , was characterized in @xcite .    in the works of maurer and ahlswede - csiszr @xcite , sk generation of maximum rate",

    "later , it was shown by csiszr - narayan @xcite that a maximum rate sk can be generated also by the terminals recovering the observations of both the terminals .",

    "* section vi ) : + _ what is the minimum overall rate of interactive communication @xmath0 required to establish a maximum rate sk ? _    we answer this question by characterizing the form of common randomness ( cr ) ( i.e. , shared bits , see @xcite ) that the terminals must establish in order to generate a maximum rate sk ; two examples of such common randomness are the observations of any one terminal @xcite and of both terminals @xcite . while our main result does not yield a single - letter characterization",
    ", it nonetheless reveals a central link between secrecy generation and wyner s notion of common information ( ci ) between two dependent rvs @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "sequences are ( almost ) independent ; this definition , though not stated explicitly in @xcite , follows from the analysis therein .",
    "we introduce a variant of this notion of ci called the _ interactive ci _ where we seek the minimum rate of cr that renders the mentioned sequences conditionally independent .",
    "clearly , interactive ci can not be smaller than wyner s ci , and can exceed it .",
    "our main contribution is to show a one - to - one correspondence between such cr and the cr established for generating an optimum rate sk .",
    "this correspondence is used to characterize the minimum rate of communication @xmath0 required for generating a maximum rate sk .",
    "in fact , it is shown that @xmath0 is simply interactive ci minus the secret key capacity .    when the number of rounds of interaction are bounded , this characterization yields a single - letter expression for @xmath0 . using this expression",
    "we show that an interactive communication scheme can have less rate than a noninteractive one , in general .",
    "however , interaction offers no advantage for binary symmetric sources .",
    "this expression also illustrates the role of sufficient statistics in sk generation .",
    "we further dwell on this relationship and show that many ci quantities of interest remain unchanged if the sources are replaced by their corresponding sufficient statistics ( with respect to each other ) .",
