    "typically the cmb anisotropy power spectrum is predicted to peak at larger multipole moment @xmath3 ( smaller angular scale ) in the open case than in the flat model .",
    "this difference in the flat and open model power spectra makes it possible for cmb anisotropy measurements to distinguish between these models .",
    "see , e.g. , barreiro ( 2000 ) , rocha ( 1999 ) , page ( 1999 ) , and gawiser & silk ( 2000 ) for recent reviews of the field .",
    "until very recently no single cmb anisotropy experiment achieved detections over a wide enough range of @xmath3 space to allow this cosmological test to be performed with data from a single experiment space for the test . by including 2 @xmath4 upper limits on cmb anisotropy ( see discussion below ) , the mat 1998 ( miller et al .",
    "1999 ) , viper ( peterson et al . 2000 ) , and boomerang 1997 ( mauskopf et al . 2000 ) observations also cover a wide enough range of @xmath3 space . ] . as a result",
    "the test has usually been performed as a goodness - of - fit ( @xmath5 ) comparison of cmb anisotropy model predictions and observations ( ganga , ratra , & sugiyama 1996 ) . in this implementation",
    "the test favors a flat model over an open one ( see , e.g. , dodelson & knox 2000 ; tegmark & zaldarriaga 2000 ; le dour et al .",
    "2000 ; lange et al . 2001 ; balbi et al . 2000 , 2001 ; amendola 2001 ) . however , this @xmath5 technique has a number of significant limitations , so these results must be viewed as tentative ( see discussion in ratra et al .",
    "1999b ) .",
    "specifically , a @xmath5 comparison does not use the complete data from an experiment .",
    "rather , it uses one ( or a few ) number(s ) ( the amplitude of a chosen model cmb power spectrum , typically the flat bandpower spectrum ) with error bars , as a summary of the complete data of the experiment .",
    "however , this amplitude ( and error bars ) is model dependent .",
    "this effect is typically @xmath6 for a data set with a good detection ( see , e.g. , ganga et al . 1997a , 1998 ; ratra et al .",
    "1999a ) , but is not accounted for in the @xmath5 comparison .",
    "more significantly , the observational error bars are derived from non - gaussian posterior probability density distribution functions and are thus fairly asymmetric .",
    "since the @xmath5 technique assumes symmetric ( gaussian ) error bars , the observational error bars must be symmetrized (  gaussianized \" ) when this technique is used .",
    "this is an arbitrary procedure , and gaussianizing in different ways leads to different reduced @xmath5 values ( ganga et al .",
    "this means that the @xmath5 technique can only provide qualitative results . nevertheless , it is useful , having provided , from a combined analysis of all available early observational results ( ratra et al .",
    "1997 ) , qualitative evidence for more cmb anisotropy power on smaller scales than on larger scales ( ganga et al .",

    "given that current observational error bars are asymmetric ( i.e. , non - gaussian ) , robust results can only be derived from a complete maximum likelihood analysis of a large collection of observational data , using realistic model cmb anisotropy power spectra . this is a very time - consuming approach and so has been applied to only a few data sets ( see , e.g. , bunn & sugiyama 1995 ; grski et al .",

    "( 1997a ) generalized the maximum likelihood technique to account for systematic errors ( e.g. , beamwidth uncertainty , calibration uncertainty ) .",
    "analyzes using this generalized technique have led to significantly revised observational results .",
    "the weighted mean and median statistics techniques are summarized in the next section . in @xmath73",
    "we use these techniques to determine binned cmb anisotropy power spectra using all cmb anisotropy measurements and in @xmath74 we consider a culled collection of good measurements .",
    "we conclude in @xmath75 .",
    "while tight constraints on cosmological parameters will be very valuable , it is also of interest to determine the shape of the observed cmb anisotropy spectrum in a model independent fashion .",
    "since the error bars for experiments to date are large , a tight determination of the cmb anisotropy spectrum is possible only if all available data are used .",
    "this approach has been pioneered by page ( 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the data we use in this paper are listed in table 1 and plotted in figure 1 .",
    "we consider all detections at @xmath8 available as of early november 2000 . while we only use detections , defined as those results where the peak of the likelihood function is at least 2 @xmath4 away from 0 @xmath9k , in our analyses here ( and these",
    "are listed in table 1 ) , figure 1 also shows 2 @xmath4 upper limits .",
    "typically , the bandtemperature ( @xmath10 ) values listed in table 1 have been derived assuming a flat bandpower spectrum and account for known systematic uncertainties ( although in most cases only in an approximate manner ) .",
    "since the flat bandpower spectrum is a more accurate representation of the true spectrum for narrower ( in @xmath3 ) window functions , we use observational results for the narrowest windows available .",
    "table 1 lists 142 detections .    to determine the observed cmb anisotropy spectrum , page ( 1997 , 1999 ) binned the detections into equally spaced logarithmic bins in @xmath3-space , based on the value of @xmath11 , the effective multipole of the experiment s window function @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "as discussed below , we instead choose to adjust the @xmath3-space widths of the bins so as to have approximately the same number of measurements in each bin .",
    "page then gaussianized the measurements by defining the error of a measurement , @xmath4 , to be half the difference between the upper and lower 1 @xmath4 values of @xmath10 for the measurement .",
    "the standard expression for the weighted mean in bin @xmath15 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 indexes the @xmath18 measurements in the bin with bandtemperature central values @xmath19 ( where the likelihood is at a maximum ) and gaussianized errors @xmath20 .",
    "the ( internal ) error estimate for each bin is @xmath21    to plot the observed cmb anisotropy power spectrum , page places @xmath22 at the arithmetic mean of the @xmath11 values of the measurements that lie in the bin .",
    "we choose instead to use the weighted mean of the @xmath11 values , @xmath23    since the weighted mean technique assumes gaussian errors , one may compute a goodness - of - fit parameter , @xmath24 , for each bin , @xmath25 @xmath26 has expected value unity with error @xmath27 , so @xmath28 is the number of standard deviations that @xmath26 deviates from unity .",
    "a large value of @xmath29 could indicate the presence of unaccounted - for systematic uncertainties , the invalidity of the gaussian assumption , or the presence of significant correlations between the measurements .",
    "an alternate method for deriving the observed cmb anisotropy spectrum is the median statistics approach developed by gott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . here",
    "one does not assume that the measurement errors are gaussian , or even that the magnitudes of the errors are known .",
    "one assumes only that the measurements are independent and free of systematic errors .",
    "the technique is discussed in detail in gott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in brief",
    ", for each bin in @xmath3-space we construct a likelihood function for the true median of the binned measurements . in principle , the highest @xmath10-space bin in this histogram extends to @xmath30 @xmath9k ; in practice we have picked the width of this bin to be the same as the width of the lowest @xmath31-space bin in the histogram .",
    "this prescription controls the large @xmath10 divergence when we integrate over the likelihood function with a logarithmic prior ( see below ) .",
    "we have ensured that each @xmath3-space bin contains a sufficient number of measurements so that the upper 2 @xmath4 limit on @xmath22 always lies below the highest @xmath10-space bin .",
    "therefore the upper 2 @xmath4 limit on @xmath22 is insensitive to the procedure used to control the large-@xmath10 divergence . ] and then integrate over this with a logarithmic prior to determine the error bars for the bin .",
    "we use a logarithmic prior since @xmath10 is positive definite ( see discussion in gott et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we have checked that a linear prior leads to qualitatively similar conclusions , with generally only small quantitative differences . in this case",
    "@xmath32 is the median measurement , which is defined to be the mean of the two central measurements if the bin contains an even number of measurements .",
    "since we determine limits on @xmath22 in each @xmath3-space bin by integrating the likelihood function for the bin , for accurate 2 @xmath4 limits we need to ensure that enough measurements lie in each bin .",
    "consequentially , in contrast to page ( 1997 , 1999 ) , we adjust the widths of the bins so that each of them contain about the same number of measurements , with precise bin membership determined by where breaks occur in the @xmath3-space distribution of the measurements of table 1 . and , instead of plotting @xmath22 at the weighted mean of the @xmath11 values of the measurements in the bin , in the median - statistics case we use the median of the @xmath11 values in the bin .",
    "since the median statistics technique ignores the individual measurement errors there is no obvious way of checking the internal goodness of fit of the derived median - statistics cmb anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "we first consider four different binnings , with about 9 , 11 , 13 , and 16 measurements in each @xmath3-space bin . tables 2 and 3 list results from the weighted - mean and median - statistics analyses . in the median - statistics case ,",
    "the logarithmic prior makes the integral of the likelihood function diverge at large and at small @xmath31 .",
    "we discuss our prescription for controlling the large-@xmath31 divergence in footnote 7 . to control the small-@xmath10 divergence we cut off the integral at small @xmath10 , with the cutoff chosen so that the lower 2 @xmath4 limit is insensitive to it ( see footnote b of table 3 for the numerical value of the cutoff used ) . figures 2 and 3 show the weighted - mean and median - statistics observed cmb anisotropy power spectra .",
    "the weighted mean analysis ( figure 2 and table 2 ) results in tight constraints on the observed cmb anisotropy power spectrum , and clearly establishes that it has a peak . for three of the four binnings",
    "used this is a rather broad peak values of those bins whose amplitudes are within @xmath33 of the maximum @xmath22 value , for the weighted - mean central value and the @xmath341 @xmath4 and @xmath342 @xmath4 limits . ] , and lies in the interval @xmath35 ( for 9 measurements per bin , figure 2@xmath36 ) , @xmath37 ( for 11 measurements per bin , figure 2@xmath38 ) , and @xmath39 ( for 13 measurements per bin , figure 2@xmath40 ) . for the case of 16 measurements per bin the peak consists of a single bin at @xmath41 . as expected , the cmb anisotropy power spectrum has less scatter as a function of @xmath3 when the number of bins is decreased .",
    "we have not considered upper limits in our analyses . from figure 2",
    "we see that at least four of these are quite constraining and if correct they could significantly affect the shape of the observed power spectrum when accounted for .",
    "these are the @xmath42 , 16 , and 20 dmr upper limits and the @xmath43 max5 @xmath9 pegasi upper limit .",
    "the dmr results are derived from the galactic frame maps and ignore the galactic emission correction ( grski 1997 ; grski et al . 1998 ) .",
    "therefore they do not account for the full uncertainty in the dmr data .",
    "our analyses also ignore the correlations between the different dmr @xmath3-space results . to derive the max5 @xmath9 pegasi upper limit ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) marginalized over a possible dust contaminant signal .",
    "ganga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) concluded that the max5 @xmath9 pegasi upper limit was not inconsistent with the other max4 and max5 results they studied pegasi upper limit region of @xmath3-space there are a number of detections with low @xmath10 .",
    "these are responsible for the prominent drop in this bin in figure 2 , especially in panels @xmath38 and @xmath40 . ] .",
    "it is quite possible that knowledge of the dust contaminant signal is less than adequate for the purpose of extracting a robust constraint on the cmb data in this case .",
    "it is troubling that three published 2 @xmath4 upper limits lie at or below the central weighted mean values derived from published detection results .    more worrisome are the large values of @xmath29 ( the dashed line in each panel of figure 2 and the last column of table 2 ) for some of the bins . for a gaussian cmb anisotropy , @xmath29 is a measure of how well the weighted mean and derived bin error bar represents the measurements that lie in the bin .",
    "this is larger than 2 ( i.e. , @xmath26 is more than 2 @xmath4 away from what is expected for a gaussian distribution ) for 5 of 16 bins for the 9 measurements per bin case ( bin numbers 1 , 5 , 8 , 9 , and 15 ) , for 4 of 13 bins for the 11 measurements per bin case ( bin numbers 1 , 4 , 8 , and 12 , and for bin number 11 @xmath44 ) , for 3 of 11 bins for the 13 measurements per bin case ( bin numbers 1 , 7 , and 10 ) , and for 3 of 9 bins for the 16 measurements per bin case ( bin numbers 1 , 5 , and 8) .",
    "note that @xmath45 for @xmath3-space bins in the peak intervals discussed above ( see table 2 ) .",
    "since at least two - thirds of the bins have small @xmath29 it is unlikely that the cmb anisotropy is non - gaussian .",
    "the large values of @xmath29 are more likely caused by unaccounted - for foreground contamination , or other effects that lead to underestimated error bars on some of the measurements , and our neglect of correlations between some of the measurements .",
    "since the second effect is thought to be small , the first effect is probably the dominant one .",
    "it is important to note that this inconsistency implies that constraints on cosmological parameters derived from @xmath5 comparisons of multiple cmb anisotropy observations and model predictions must be interpreted with care .",
    "the median statistics technique does not make use of the error bars on the measurements .",
    "therefore it is ideally suited for an analysis of this combination of cmb anisotropy data .",
    "the median statistics analyses result in somewhat weaker constraints on the observed cmb anisotropy detections power spectrum ( figure 3 and table 3 ) , but still clearly establish that it has a peak .",
    "the median - statistics peak interval is slightly broader and extends to slightly smaller angular scales than the weighted - mean peak interval .",
    "the median - statistics peak lies in the interval @xmath46 ( for 9 measurements per bin , figure 3@xmath36 ) , @xmath47 ( for 11 measurements per bin , figure 3@xmath38 ) , @xmath48 ( for 13 measurements per bin , figure 3@xmath40 ) , and @xmath49 ( for 16 measurements per bin , figure 3@xmath50 ) .",
    "it is significant that the median - statistics constraints on @xmath22 are significantly weaker than the weighted - mean constraints on @xmath22 for those bins with large @xmath29 values from the weighted mean analysis .",
    "we note that , although the median - statistics constraints are weaker , the median - statistics power spectra of detections are also inconsistent with the three 2 @xmath4 upper limits that are a problem for the weighted - mean power spectra .",
    "in the weighted mean analyses of the previous section we found that a number of @xmath3-space bins had large values of @xmath29 . we argued that these large @xmath29 values were likely the consequence of underestimated error bars on some of the measurements .    to examine this issue",
    "we proceed as follows . for each binning in the weighted mean analysis above ( i.e. , with 9 , 11 , 13 , and 16 measurements per bin ) we compute the (  reduced @xmath5 \" ) contribution to @xmath24 ( eq . [ 4 ] ) from each measurement in the bin , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "we then list the measurements in decreasing order of @xmath51 and discard the first seven that appear in at least 3 of the 4 binnings used .",
    "these  discrepant \" measurements are listed in table 4 . while this procedure need not necessarily result in reducing all large @xmath29 values , it has the advantage of being less binning dependent than a procedure designed solely to reduce large @xmath29 values to values that are consistent with the gaussianity assumption .",
    "we first discuss the discrepant measurements of table 4 . as mentioned above , the dmr results do not account for the full uncertainty in the dmr data ( grski 1997 ; gorski et al . 1998 ) , and our analyses also ignore correlations between the different dmr @xmath3-space measurements .",
    "these effects might explain why the dmr measurements in table 4 are discrepant .",
    "the value of the cosmological dmr quadrupole ( @xmath53 ) moment is dependent on the model used to remove foreground galactic emission ( kogut et al .",
    "1996 ) , and this effect might also contribute to explaining why the dmr @xmath53 moment is discrepant . the low max3 @xmath9 pegasi result ( meinhold et al",
    ". 1993 , as recomputed by j. gundersen , private communication 1995 , see ratra et al .",
    "1997 ) is from a region that is contaminated with dust , and this effect could explain why this measurement is discrepant . while the mat97 ka2 8-point and q3 8-point results ( torbet et al . 1999 ) are higher than neighboring measurements in @xmath3-space ( see table 1 ) , we do not know of an effect that might be responsible for making them discrepant .",
    "the msam 2-beam combined result is from a combined analysis of data from three different flights ( wilson et al .",
    "we note that the three individual msam 2-beam results have significant scatter ( which seems to be larger than what one might expect from their error bars , see table 1 of wilson et al .",
    "2000 , unlike the msam 3-beam results ) .",
    "it is unclear what causes this scatter , but it is likely that this effect is responsible for placing the msam 2-beam measurement among those that are discrepant .",
    "we again emphasize that the measurements in table 4 are discrepant only if the cmb anisotropy is gaussian .",
    "in particular , the posterior probability distribution function of the dmr quadrupole is somewhat non - gaussian ( hinshaw et al . 1996 ) , and this effect also contributes to explaining this discrepancy .    after removing the seven most discrepant measurements we rebin the remaining 135 measurements , using four different binnings , with about 9 , 11 , 13 , and 15 measurements per @xmath3-space bin .",
    "we then analyze this culled data set using both the weighted - mean and median - statistics techniques .",
    "tables 5 and 6 and figures 4 and 5 show the results from these analyses .    the weighted mean analyses ( figure 4 and table 5 ) again",
    "result in tight constraints on the observed cmb anisotropy power spectrum and again clearly establish the presence of a peak .",
    "this is again a rather broad peak that lies in the interval @xmath35 ( for 9 measurements per bin , figure 4@xmath36 ) , @xmath54 ( for 11 measurements per bin , figure 4@xmath38 ) , @xmath55 ( for 13 measurements per bin , figure 4@xmath40 ) , and @xmath56 ( for 15 measurements per bin , figure 4@xmath50 ) .",
    "after removal of the discrepant measurements of table 4 , the weighted - mean observed cmb anisotropy power spectra have less scatter ( compare figures 4 and 2 ) .",
    "there remains the problem of 2 @xmath4 upper limits that lie below the observed spectrum of the detections , and in particular the @xmath57 max5 @xmath9 pegasi upper limit is now more inconsistent with the observed spectrum of detections ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "while the culled data results in many fewer large @xmath29 values ( the dashed line in each panel of figure 4 and the last column in table 5 ) , some bins still contain data that appear to be discrepant ( i.e. , the weighted mean is more than 2 @xmath4 away from what is expected for a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "@xmath29 is larger than 2 for the penultimate of 15 bins for the 9 measurements per bin case , for bin 6 and 11 ( of 12 ) for the 11 measurements per bin case , for the penultimate of 10 bins for the 13 measurements per bin case , and for the penultimate of 9 bins for the 15 measurements per bin case . in the penultimate bins , the most discrepant measurements are sk95 c15 and mat98 g9 ( for 9 measurements per bin ) , sk95 c15 and maxima-1 4 ( for 11 measurements per bin ) , boomerang98 8 and sk95 c13 ( for 13 measurements per bin ) , and boomerang98 7 , sk95 c12 and c13 , the last two being equally discrepant ( for 15 measurements per bin )",
    "the two most discrepant measurements in bin 6 for the 11 measurements per bin case are max5 hr5127 6 @xmath58 and mat97 ka2 7-point",
    ". it would be useful to understand why these measurements appear discrepant .",
    "while it is possible to remove apparently discrepant measurements from the already culled data set to reduce @xmath29 below 2 for all bins , it is not clear what is gained from this . clearly , some published cmb anisotropy measurements are mutually inconsistent , if the cmb anisotropy is gaussian and correlations between measurements are not large .",
    "it would thus appear to be dangerous to draw conclusions about the exact position of the peak in the cmb anisotropy spectrum on the basis of the weighted mean analyses alone .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 comparisons between cmb anisotropy measurements and model predictions ( to constrain cosmological parameter values ) are based on both the above assumptions .",
    "such @xmath5 analyses of collections of cmb anisotropy measurements most likely include mutually inconsistent measurements , and so , without more careful investigation , results based on such analyses must be viewed as tentative , at best .",
    "the median statistics results for the culled data set are shown in figure 5 ( also see table 6 ) .",
    "once again , the median statistics analyses result in somewhat weaker constraints on the observed cmb anisotropy detections power spectrum than do the weighted mean analyses , but still clearly establish the presence of a peak . the median - statistics peak interval is broader and typically extends more to somewhat smaller angular scales than the weighted - mean peak interval .",
    "the median - statistics peak lies in the interval @xmath59 ( for 9 measurements per bin , figure 5@xmath36 ) , @xmath60 ( for 11 measurements per bin , figure 5@xmath38 ) , @xmath61 ( for 13 measurements per bin , figure 5@xmath40 ) , and @xmath62 ( for 15 measurements per bin , figure 5@xmath50 ) .",
    "the median - statistics power spectra of cmb anisotropy detections are still inconsistent with some of the 2 @xmath4 upper limits ( see figure 5 )",
    ".    comparing the median - statistics observed cmb anisotropy detections power spectra to model predictions ( figure 5 ) , we see that the @xmath63 flat-@xmath2 and @xmath64 fiducial cdm inflation models are not inconsistent with the 2 @xmath4 range of the observations .",
    "while the fiducial cdm model might have slightly lower power than is favored by the observations at @xmath65 and at @xmath66 , the @xmath63 open cdm inflation model has significantly lower power than is indicated by the observations at @xmath67 and at @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize however that the observations at @xmath68 are quite consistent with the ( first peak of the ) open model , and the error bars here are large enough for the observations to be consistent with the presence of a second peak in the flat-@xmath2 and fiducial cdm cases .",
    "note that results derived using the weighted mean technique ( figure 4 ) are inconsistent with these predictions , i.e. , at @xmath68 the weighted mean analyses rule out a first peak in the open case and a second peak in the flat models .",
    "we extend page s ( 1997 , 1999 ) weighted mean technique and use it to determine the binned observed cmb anisotropy detection power spectrum . given the observational error bars , the binned power spectra in a number of bins are not a good representation of the measurements .",
    "moreover , there are a number of 2 @xmath4 upper limits that are inconsistent with the binned power spectra of detections .",
    "a number of effects could explain these results , but we suspect that a major one is improperly accounted for or inadequately modelled systematic effects , especially foreground emission contamination , with correlations between some measurements playing a smaller role .",
    "these results have two important ramifications .",
    "first , constraints on cosmological parameters derived from @xmath5 comparisons between cmb anisotropy model predictions and measurements must be interpreted with great care . and certainly a full maximum likelihood comparison ( e.g. , ratra et al .",
    "1999b ) is to be preferred .",
    "second , it is important to reanalyze observational data and account for systematic and other effects that may have been ignored in the initial analyses ( see ganga et al .",
    "1997a for the general technique and ratra et al . 1998 , 1999a for cases",
    "where a more careful accounting of such effects have led to significant revisions of the observational results ) .",
    "we have focussed on two methods for dealing with the inconsistencies identified by the weighted mean analyses .",
    "we have used the median statistics technique developed by gott et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to determine an observed cmb anisotropy detections power spectrum .",
    "this method makes fewer assumptions than the weighted mean technique ( see discussion in gott et al .",
    "in particular , it completely ignores the error bars on the individual measurements . the median statistics method results in somewhat weaker constraints on the observed cmb anisotropy power spectrum than does the weighted mean technique ( compare figures 3 and 2 ) .",
    "if the cmb anisotropy is gaussian , and if correlations between measurements are small ( as is expected for the data we have used ) , then the weaker median - statistics constraints on the observed cmb anisotropy power spectrum is another indication that the error bars on some measurements might be too small ( given the scatter in their central values ) .    to test the impact of outliers , we remove the seven most discrepant measurements ( with largest reduced @xmath5 values , as discussed above ) and determine a weighted - mean observed cmb anisotropy power spectrum ( for the culled data set with 135 measurements ) .",
    "the resultant power spectrum of detections is a much better fit for most ( but not all ) bins but it is still inconsistent with some of the 2 @xmath4 upper limits . a median statistics analysis of the culled data set again results in significantly weaker constraints on the observed power spectrum .    in summary , our analyses show that if the cmb anisotropy is gaussian , and if correlations between measurements are not significant , some observational results are mutually inconsistent . until this issue",
    "is resolved it is not possible to determine a robust observational cmb anisotropy power spectrum , much less constrain cosmological parameters from @xmath5 comparisons of theoretical predictions and observational results . while the open cdm model is not inconsistent with observational data at @xmath68 , it predicts significantly less power than is seen at @xmath0 . if foregrounds do not contribute significantly to the data at @xmath0 , the spatially - flat model must be favored significantly over the open one .",
    "this result is consistent with other observational data that are compatible with a flat model with a time - variable @xmath2 ( see , e.g. , ratra & peebles 1988 ; haiman , mohr , & holder 2000 ; podariu & ratra 2000 ; gonzlez - daz 2000 ; chimento , jakubi , & pavo 2000 ; tye & wasserman 2001 ; hebecker & wetterich 2001 ; podariu , nugent , & ratra 2001 ; barger & marfatia 2001 ) . unlike the weighted - mean results ,",
