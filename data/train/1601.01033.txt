    "the bounded burnside problem was solved by s.  adyan and p.  novikov  @xcite in 1968 .",
    "the _ restricted burnside problem _ ( the bounded burnside problem in the class of residually finite groups ) was solved ( in the negative ) in 1989 by e.  zelmanov  @xcite . for a survey of the burnside problem and related topics ,",

    "in fact , most methods of study of these groups heavily rely on their residual finiteness ( e.g. , on their action on a rooted tree ) .",

    "theorem  [ th : theoremone ] produces a new large class of groups of burnside type .",
    "it includes the grigorchuk group , so it intersects with the above mentioned third class of periodic groups , but it also contains many simple groups . for instance , we produce first example of groups of burnside type generated by piecewise isometries of a polygon ( with a finite number of pieces ) .    any non - free ( i.e. , such that some non - trivial elements have fixed points ) action of @xmath7 can be fragmented so that it satisfies the conditions of theorem  [ th : theoremone ] . for example , if @xmath23 is a minimal _ palindromic _ subshift ( such that elements of @xmath24 contain arbitrary long palindromes ) , then the transformations @xmath25 for @xmath26 generate a minimal action of @xmath7 such that @xmath0 or @xmath10 ( depending on parity of the lengths of arbitrarily long palindromes ) have a fixed point .",

    "see also  @xcite , where spectral properties of a substitutional system associated with the grigorchuk group are studied .",
    "answers to the burnside problem were important examples for the theory of amenable groups .",
    "amenability was defined by j.  von  neumann  @xcite in his analysis of the banach - tarski paradox .",
    "he noted that a group containing a non - commutative free group is non - amenable , and showed that amenability is preserved under some group - theoretic operations ( extensions , direct limits , passing to a subgroup and to a quotient ) .",
    "so , there are `` obviously non - amenable '' groups ( groups containing a free subgroup ) , and `` obviously amenable '' groups ( groups that can be constructed from finite and commutative groups using the above operations ) .",
    "the `` obviously amenable '' groups are called _ elementary amenable_. more on amenability , see  @xcite .",
    "groups of burnside type are never obviously non - amenable , since they do not contain free subgroups .",

    "the topological full group of a ( cyclic in this case ) group @xmath18 acting on a cantor set @xmath1 is the group of all homeomorphisms @xmath28 such that for every @xmath4 there exists a neighborhood @xmath29 of @xmath30 and an element @xmath20 such that @xmath31 . in other words",

    ", the group @xmath11 can be embedded into the topological full group of a minimal subshift .",
    "this was observed for the first time ( for the grigorchuk group ) by n.  matte  bon in  @xcite .",

    "j.  milnor asked in  @xcite whether there exists a group with growth function eventually bigger than any polynomial and eventually smaller than any exponential function .",
    "such groups are called groups of _ intermediate growth _ , and the first example of",
    "such a group is the grigorchuk group from  @xcite .",
    "amenability of the grigorchuk group follows from its intermediate growth . until now",
    "all known groups of intermediate growth were either based on the grigorchuk s examples , or were very close to it ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "see , for example  @xcite where the grigorchuk group is used to construct groups with different growth types and boundary behavior .",
    "recently , l.  bartholdi and a.  erschler developed a technique of _ inverted orbits _ , and used it to construct a great variety of groups with a prescribed intermediate growth , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "all these constructions of groups of intermediate growth used as a starting point the groups from the family of grigorchuk groups defined in  @xcite .",
    "this imposes some restrictions on the type of groups that can be obtained this way .",
    "in particular , the following problem , asked by r.  grigorchuk in 1984 ( see problem 9.8 in the `` kourovka notebook ''  @xcite ) remained to be open .    [ prob : grigorchuk ] does there exist a finitely generated simple group of intermediate growth ?",

    "in fact , it was even an open question for a long time whether all groups of intermediate growth are residually finite ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "its set of vertices is the @xmath18-orbit of @xmath30 . for every vertex @xmath41 and every generator @xmath42 we have an edge connecting @xmath41 with @xmath43 , labeled by @xmath44 .",
    "since the generators @xmath42 act one each point either trivially or as one of the homeomorphisms @xmath8 , the graph @xmath40 is just a `` decorated '' version of the orbital graph of @xmath30 for the dihedral group @xmath16 .",
    "the latter is a bi - infinite chain , whose edges are alternatingly labeled by @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",

    "the liouville condition ( absence of non - constant bounded harmonic functions ) is stronger than amenability , but weaker than subexponential growth .",
    "our method of proving periodicity and intermediate growth is substantially different from the original proofs of periodicity and intermediate growth of the grigorchuk group , since we can not use an action on a rooted tree . all previous proofs of intermediate growth of a group used `` length reduction '' of automorphisms of rooted trees , as in the original paper of r.  grigorchuk , or used intermediate growth of the grigorchuk groups .",
    "we study how points travel inside the orbital graphs @xmath40 under the action of positive powers of one element ( to prove periodicity ) or under the action of a long product of generators ( to prove intermediate growth ) . in both cases",
    "we use one - dimensional structure of the orbit , i.e. , the fact that a trajectory starting in one vertex and ending in another has to pass through all the vertices between them .",
    "small neighborhoods of the special point @xmath13 from theorem  [ th : theoremone ] act as `` reflectors '' : trajectories approaching them often `` bounce '' and change their direction .",
    "this is used in theorem  [ th : theoremone ] to prove that a sequence @xmath55 , @xmath56 , must eventually come back to @xmath30 , thus getting periodicity of @xmath57 .",
    "similar idea shows that in the case when @xmath40 is linearly repetitive , the trajectory @xmath58 of a vertex @xmath30 under a long product @xmath59 of generators of @xmath18 tends to change its direction often , so that it rarely goes far away .",
    "this gives a subexponential estimate of the form @xmath60 on the total number of elements @xmath61 , thus proving theorem  [ th : two ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the proof of the main result of  @xcite , as analyzed in  @xcite and  @xcite , is also using a similar idea : trajectories of a random walk on the orbital graph @xmath40 eventually return back to @xmath30 with probability one .",
    "this , together with the one - dimensional structure of the graph implies amenability of the group . here",
    "we do not need the `` reflectors '' produced by a special point of @xmath1 , since we need only a probabilistic result in this case .",
