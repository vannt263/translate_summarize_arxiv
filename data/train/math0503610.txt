    "there is a rooted tree for each realization , and the correspondence induces a probability measure in the set of rooted trees .",
    "a rooted tree , drawn according to this measure , is called a galton - watson tree .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the speed on a galton - watson tree is a constant a.s .. more remarkably , an explicit formula is given when @xmath17 .",

    "the speed of the simple random walk on an infinite cluster of the binary tree with pipes is @xmath30 which is not monotone in @xmath19 .",
    "very often a random environment ( or graph ) exhibits nice characters of a homogeneous environment ( or a transitive graph ) .",
