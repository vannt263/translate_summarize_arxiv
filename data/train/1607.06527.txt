    "liquid crystal phases have been studied extensively@xcite , and have been found to have multiple technological applications .",
    "their internal configuration can be easily manipulated with external fields or confining surfaces @xcite , leading to uses as varied as in displays or sensors .",
    "experiments by jkli _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and , more recently , by cheng _",
    "et al_.@xcite , show that in contrast to calamitic mesogens , bent - core liquid crystals can form long , stable fibers .",
    "these fibers , whose internal configuration consists of a spiral of smectic layers with well - aligned molecular dipoles , can be used as waveguides @xcite .",
    "bailey _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed a free energy model for such fibers as a function of the director orientation . by assuming a constant director orientation",
    ", these authors found the corresponding equilibrium states .",
    "their model comprises three bulk contributions ( frank elasticity , layer - compression and electrostatic energies ) and two surface terms ( surface tension and divergence of molecular dipole orientation ) .",
    "prez - ortiz _ _ et al.__@xcite revisited this model using a variational approach and found that , in order to satisfy the boundary conditions inherent to such a system , there must exist a boundary layer with inhomogeneous director orientation . by assuming that the electrostatic contribution is small compared with the other energies , they linearized the euler - lagrange equations and solved them analytically , thereby showing that the boundary layer is about 100 nanometers thick .",
    "bauman _ _ et al.__@xcite analyzed the stability of liquid - crystal fibers formed by bent - core mesogens using a generalization of a free energy model proposed by bailey _",
    "@xcite : the fiber is described by concentric smectic layers , and the free energy is represented with a landau expansion with orientational and strain elasticity , electric self interaction and dipolar divergence contributions , as well as surface tension .",
    "assuming that the width of the smectic layers is small compared with the fiber radius , they proposed a criterion for the stability of the fibers : if the frank energy is comparable to the energy for bending the smectic layer , then a circular fiber is stable .    to the best of our knowledge , however , past work",
    "has not considered the case when the electrostatic energy is of the same order of magnitude as other terms in the free energy , particularly when the director orientation is position dependent .",
    "this case is important because bent - core liquid crystals have relatively large spontaneous polarization @xmath0 , as reported as early as 1991 by niori et al.,@xcite and therefore large values of electrostatic energy density .",
    "as we show in section [ freeenergymodel ] , the ratio of the free energy densities associated to spontaneous polarization and frank elasticity is of the order of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a characteristic length for changes in the director , @xmath3 is the permittivity of vacuum and @xmath4 is a frank elastic constant . assuming the values @xmath0= 50 nc @xmath5 reported by niori et al.,@xcite @xmath2 = 100 nm reported for the boundary layer by prez - ortiz et al.,@xcite and a typical value @xmath6 n,@xcite we find that the electrostatic energy density associated with @xmath0 is about thirty times larger than the elastic energy density .",
    "even larger values of spontaneous polarization may be obtained using recently reported mesogens with polarized metallorganic complexes at the tip of their bent cores : ohtani and coworkers reported a value @xmath0 = 1.08 @xmath7c @xmath5 for a bent - core liquid crystal synthetized with oxovanadium complexes.@xcite    in this work , we propose a field - theory monte carlo simulation where the degrees of freedom are provided by the director field . using the fully nonlinear free energy model of prez - ortiz",
    "_ et al . _ , we study the case when the electrostatic contribution can not be neglected in comparison with the elastic or the layer compression terms .",
    "we search for the equilibrium states , and find that they have boundary layers of widths comparable to those predicted by prez - ortiz _ et al .",
    "_ building on that finding , monte carlo simulations are also used to identify the equilibrium states that occur for configurations where the free energy model is non - differentiable .",
    "such configurations are necessarily missed by the euler - lagrange equation formulation .",
    "we find first - order transitions between metastable and stable equilibria of differentiable and non - differentiable character .",
    "finally , using values for the material parameters reported previously @xcite , our simulations are used to predict the radii of fibers in equilibrium in the same range as those observed experimentally .",
    "these radii are highly sensitive to the coefficient of the electrostatic energy , @xmath8 , in the sense that doubling the value of this parameter leads to an increment of one order of magnitude of the equilibrium radius .",
    "from the experiments of chen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , we take the structure of the lc fiber to be that of a rolled smectic layer .",
    "thus , we model the fiber as a cylinder having an internal spiral arrangement ( see fig .  [ fig1 ]  a ) .",
    "the fiber has an external radius @xmath9 and the topological defect at the center is taken to have a radius @xmath10 ( see fig  [ fig1 ]  b ) . by following a radial trajectory from the center to the surface of the fiber ,",
    "we encounter a series of smectic layers . making the approximation that the director orientation changes very slowly with the azimuthal coordinate ( @xmath11 ) in comparison with the radial one ( @xmath12 ) , we take the director s orientation @xmath13 to be a function of @xmath12 alone , just as proposed by perez - ortiz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "our model for the free energy is similar to that of bailey _",
    "@xcite but without the assumption of a uniform orientation field .",
    "we describe our free energy model in terms of the orientation field of the liquid crystal through three orthonormal vectors : @xmath14 is the director , @xmath15 is the molecular dipole vector and @xmath16 .",
    "this orthonormal basis is defined by the following parameterization : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19and @xmath20 are the cylindrical - coordinates orthonormal basis .",
    "these vectors are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "as mentioned above , we model the liquid crystal fiber in a field - theory framework , using the director @xmath21 .",
    "the fiber is described through the interplay of three bulk free energy contributions plus two surface terms : @xmath22 where the volumetric free - energy densities @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to orientational elasticity , layer compression elasticity , and dielectric contributions , respectively .",
    "the surface free - energy densities @xmath26 and @xmath27 model the effect of anisotropic surface tension and a contribution associated with inhomogeneities of polarization direction of the lc .",
    "these terms have been discussed by bailey _",
    "et al_. @xcite and prez - ortiz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and only a brief account is included in what follows .      since we do not assume that the orientation of the lc is homogeneous inside the fiber , we have to consider the effect of distortions in the orientation .",
    "for this , we use the frank - oseen expression for liquid crystal elasticity , in terms of spatial derivatives of the director @xcite , @xmath28 ^ 2 + { k_{33}\\over 2 } \\left [ \\pmb{n } \\times \\left (   \\pmb{\\nabla } \\times \\pmb{n } \\right )   \\right]^2.\\ ] ] these terms consider splay , twist and bend modes and the coefficients @xmath29 are the respective elastic constants . using the one - constant approximation , @xmath30 , in cylindrical coordinates the frank - oseen density simplifies to @xmath31.\\ ] ] we follow bailey _ et al . _ and prez - ortiz _ et al . _ and study the bulk free - energy of the fiber by neglecting the contribution from the defect - core region @xcite , which has a size of the order of the coherence length @xmath32 ( for our system , @xmath33  nm ) @xcite .    as the mesogens in a given layer change orientation ,",
    "the layer width will also change .",
    "we model the layer - compression free energy density through the layer s strain ( @xmath34 ) produced when the width changes from its value @xmath35 in the flat - layer smectic to a value @xmath36 inside the fiber , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the layer compression modulus .",
    "the orientation dependent width @xmath39 has been estimated by bailey _",
    "et al_. in terms of the local orthonormal vectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the liquid crystal @xcite : @xmath42 the constants @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 correspond to the width , depth and height of a rectangular box encasing a bent - core mesogen , as shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig2 ] . for the flat - layer width",
    ", we introduce the flat - layer orientation angles @xmath46 and @xmath47 and substitute them in eq.([layerwidth ] ) : @xmath48    when mesogens pack parallel to each other inside the layers , a spontaneous polarization @xmath49 is produced in addition to the polarization proportional to the electric field . then , the constitutive relation for the electric displacement is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dielectric tensor of the lc .",
    "the free energy density for such a dielectric has been discussed by landau _ et al_.@xcite and ( at constant charge ) it is given by    @xmath52    from @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and assuming that the spontaneous polarization is parallel to the molecular dipole vector @xmath15 , @xmath55 one can find the electric field as @xcite : @xmath56   \\ ; \\text{d}r = - { p_0 \\sin{\\alpha } \\over \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_{rr } } \\sin{\\theta } , \\label{electricfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a component of the dielectric tensor in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath58 written in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath59 of that tensor . in eq.([electricfield ] ) we have assumed that the contribution to the electrostatic free energy in the core region ( @xmath60 in fig [ fig1 ] b ) is so small that we can extend the integration down to zero ( i.e. , @xmath61 ) .",
    "substitution of eq.([electricfield ] ) into eq.([dielectricfreeenergydensityfrome ] ) yields the final expression for the electrostatic free - energy density of the dielectric as a function of the lc orientation : @xmath62      we include in our model the energy due to the interfacial tension at the surface of the fiber , @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the biaxial surface - tension tensor : @xmath65 so the surface free - energy due to interfacial tension is @xmath66    inhomogeneities in the polarization direction give rise to a bulk free energy with two contributions : the first one is of elastic origin and is due to packing effects of the mesogens .",
    "the second arises from electrostatic energy due to inhomogeneous spontaneous polarization @xcite : @xmath67 the constants @xmath8 and @xmath68 correspond to the elastic and electrostatic contributions , respectively .",
    "again , by assuming that @xmath49 is parallel to @xmath15 , one can integrate this bulk density over the volume of the fiber to obtain a surface density free - energy term @xcite : @xmath69",
    "for the simulation , we write the free energy in non - dimensional form : @xmath70 \\text{d}r + a_\\text{s}f^*_\\text{s } + a_\\text{d } f^*_\\text{d }   , \\label{inteneadi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the fiber length , @xmath72 , four constants are given by @xmath73 and the free energy densities by @xmath74    by assuming cylindrical symmetry , we solve for @xmath21 on a one - dimensional mesh with @xmath75 or @xmath76 nodes along the radial coordinate .",
    "the mesh starts one coherence length away from the center and ends at the surface of the fiber . since we anticipate that @xmath21 varies slowly away from the fiber surface , we place half of the nodes equidistantly between the surface and 15 coherence lengths below it .",
    "the other half is distributed equidistantly in the last 15 coherence lengths .",
    "we then estimate numerically the integral in ( [ inteneadi ] ) by the sum @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the location of the @xmath80-th node .",
    "the simulations were started by setting all @xmath81 to a single value , as described below .",
    "we then iterate metropolis monte carlo steps as follows : from the old configuration , @xmath82 , we select with uniform probability the value at the @xmath83-th node , @xmath84 .",
    "an update is then proposed to a new value : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a random number ( distributed uniformly between zero and one ) and @xmath87 is a parameter that controls the maximum increment to @xmath88 .",
    "the new value is accepted with probability@xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the difference of free energies between the new and original configurations : @xmath91 - \\mathcal{f}^*\\left [ \\theta^o \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each simulation , constant @xmath87 was chosen so that acceptance of the proposed configuration was between 20% and 50% @xcite . by changing the value of metropolis parameter @xmath92",
    ", we implemented a simulated annealing method @xcite . in a typical simulation ,",
    "we iterate the metropolis mc steps , and every 10 million of them we anneal the system . the results were analyzed with mathematica 8.0 @xcite .",
    "prior to our simulations , we studied the behavior of the non - dimensional bulk free energy as a function of the constant value of a uniform orientation field , @xmath93 , for two cases : first , by changing the parameter @xmath46 of flat - layer orientation at fixed external radius @xmath9 , and then by changing @xmath9 at fixed @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ enetheanalytic ] shows the bulk free energy for several values of the flat - layer orientation @xmath94 , for constant external radius @xmath95 m . for small values of @xmath46",
    ", there exists only a minimum at @xmath96 .",
    "this minimum is non - differentiable , due to the absolute value in the layer compression term .",
    "since the derivative is not defined at the origin , it can not be found by setting it to zero .",
    "as one increases the value of @xmath46 , the bulk free energy acquires two additional minima .",
    "they are metastable with respect to the non - differentiable minimum until @xmath46 reaches the transition value 0.726 . for larger values of @xmath46 ,",
    "the stable minimum is the one with @xmath97 . since the change in the value of the stable minimum at the transition is discontinuous",
    ", this model predicts a first - order transition .",
    "there is also a first - order transition that depends on the external radius of the fiber ; in our simulations , we are able to set specific values of the fiber radius , even if this may be difficult to achieve experimentally . in order to show the transition , fig .",
    "[ eneradanalytic ] displays the behavior of the bulk free energy ( at fixed flat - layer orientation @xmath98 ) for the external radii @xmath99 nm . as before ,",
    "we observe three minima and the bulk free energy is non - differentiable at @xmath96 .",
    "when the radius is small , the stable minimum is that for @xmath97 , but there is a transition when @xmath100 789  nm and , for larger values , the stable minimum is that with @xmath101 .",
    "in our monte carlo simulations we allow for non - uniform fields @xmath21 and take into account both the bulk and surface terms in the free energy .",
    "we set the material parameters to the values given in table  [ tabla1 ] , taken from bailey et al.@xcite and prez - ortiz et al.@xcite .",
    ".the parameters for the liquid crystal used in our simulations are taken from the works of bailey et al.@xcite and prez - ortiz et al.@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in order to test for the first transition , we run simulations at constant radius @xmath102 m and vary @xmath46 . at @xmath103 , we had originally expected a stable state with @xmath104 and a metastable state with @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , we initialized the system to the uniform field @xmath106 and tracked the total free energy of the system .",
    "we observed that indeed the system adopts one of two configurations : the first one tends to @xmath107 as @xmath108 , the other tends to @xmath109 ( see fig .",
    "[ enethe25]a ) .",
    "both configurations display boundary layers .",
    "the first configuration has higher free energy than the second , as shown in fig .",
    "[ enethe25]b , and therefore it is confirmed to be metastable with respect to the latter .    at first , since the system was initialized to @xmath106 and @xmath110 , the system adopted the metastable configuration .",
    "the stable configuration was obtained through an annealing procedure , by temporarily decreasing the metropolis parameter ( @xmath111 ) until the system abandoned the metastable state , and then resetting it to its original value .",
    "the long - dashed and solid lines in fig .",
    "[ enethe25]b are averages over the metastable and stable states , respectively , over the corresponding plateaus displayed in fig .",
    "[ enethe25]b .",
    "there is an additional indication of the presence of the stable state in the bulk free energy : when the system is in the metastable state with @xmath107 , the boundary layer that goes continuously from zero to @xmath112 shows a kink as it passes through the stable - mimimum value @xmath113 .",
    "this is because the mesh nodes with values close to the stable minimum are less likely to change when subjected to the metropolis criterion .",
    "we next simulated the case with @xmath114 , where a stable state was expected with @xmath115 and a metastable state with @xmath116 .",
    "initializing the system to the uniform field @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we observed again two different equilibrium configurations : the first one tends to @xmath119 away from the surface , the second tends to @xmath120 ( see fig .",
    "[ enethe25]e ) .",
    "these values are close to the minima estimated solely from the bulk free energy : 0 and @xmath121 , respectively . despite the presence of boundary layers",
    ", @xmath122 in the simulation differs less than 7% from the value predicted from the homogeneous - bulk approximation .",
    "this indicates that the surface effects are very short ranged and they do not affect the fiber interior too much .",
    "since the simulation was initialized to @xmath117 , the system adopted the metastable configuration first .",
    "again , the stable configuration was obtained with an annealing procedure , by temporarily decreasing @xmath123 until the system abandoned the metastable state , and then resetting it to its original value . in fig .",
    "[ enethe25]e we show a snapshot of the orientation field as it transits from the metastable state to the stable one ; since the mc simulation is based on local changes to the values of the orientation field , we observe that some nodes in the simulation mesh overcome the energy barrier and then the transition propagates as a wave .",
    "we located the transition point in the mc simulations by requiring that the free energies of the coexisting minima be equal .",
    "we found the value @xmath124 , which is near to the homogenous - bulk estimate @xmath125 .",
    "figure  [ enethe25]c shows the two coexisting states at @xmath124 and @xmath118 : the first one starts close to zero and then develops a boundary layer .",
    "the second state was found by initializing with the uniform field @xmath117 ; it tends to the bulk value @xmath126 away from its boundary layer .",
    "only the boundary layer of the first state shows a kink , since it is the only one that has to pass through the other minimum to reach its value at the surface .",
    "figure  [ simrad020 ] shows the configurations obtained by monte carlo simulations ( at constant flat - layer orientation @xmath127 ) confirming the presence of stable and metastable states on both sides of the first - order transition , as a function of the external radius of the fiber .    for the larger radius @xmath128  nm , we started the simulation with a uniform field @xmath129 and @xmath118 .",
    "at first , the system stayed in a metastable state with @xmath130 but after annealing ( with @xmath111 ) it reached the stable configuration with @xmath131 .    for the smallest radius , 200 nm , we initialized to the uniform field @xmath132 and @xmath133 and found a state with @xmath101 .",
    "then , by temporarily decreasing @xmath92 to @xmath134 in the annealing procedure , the system changed to the stable state with @xmath135 .",
    "analysis of the free energies of both states shows that the first one is only metastable .",
    "we located the transition in the simulations at @xmath136 nm , which is far from the value @xmath137 nm obtained by neglecting the surface contribution .",
    "this is because the surface contribution becomes increasingly important for small radii , as is the case at the transition .",
    "the two coexisting states were found by initializing to two different conditions : @xmath132 and @xmath138 for the state with @xmath119 ; @xmath117 and @xmath138 for the configuration with @xmath130 .    finally , we found the equilibrium radius that corresponds to a fixed value of the flat - layer orientation @xmath46 , by tracking the stable states of a succession of simulations with increasing radii , using the material parameters previously used by prez - ortiz et al.@xcite and bailey et al.@xcite figure  [ fig7 ] shows that the total free energy of the stable states displays a definite minimum as a function of the external radius @xmath9 , corresponding to an equilibrium radius of 2.37  @xmath7 m .",
    "this value is within the the range of reported experimental observations @xcite .    by repeating the sequence of simulations with a different value of the parameter @xmath8",
    ", we found that the equilibrium radius is particularly sensitive to the surface free energy due to inhomogeneities in the polarization .",
    "a doubling of @xmath8 yields a tenfold increment of the equilibrium radius : specifically , going from @xmath139 n / m to 0.040 n / m results in a change of @xmath9 from 2.37 @xmath7 m to 22 @xmath7 m . from these observations",
    ", we predict that changes in the surface tension may also affect greatly the equilibrium radius .",
    "in this work we presented field - theory monte carlo simulations using a free energy model with both bulk and surface contributions . we confirmed that the equilibrium configurations display a boundary layer of about 15 coherence lengths as well as a largely constant plateau , as predicted by prez - ortiz _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "we analyzed the bulk free energy and found that it predicts a first - order transition for the director orientation , both as a function of the flat - layer angle @xmath46 and the fiber radius @xmath9 .",
    "we confirmed this with our monte carlo method and identified a perturbing effect of the stable minima on the boundary layers of coexisting or metastable configurations .",
    "both stable and metastable equilibrium configurations can be used as inputs for models of the propagation of light along the lc fibers .",
    "a straightforward generalization of our monte carlo methodology is to introduce a second orientation field , @xmath140 so that the director no longer is confined to planes perpendicular to the fiber axis .",
    "this would enable one to address escaped configurations @xcite that lack central defects .    regarding defects , our present model can not describe the behavior of the lc at their core because of the divergence of frank elasticity .",
    "however , it would be possible to include the defects by expressing the bulk free energy in terms of the tensor order parameter ( * q * ) , as in the model proposed by mukherjee @xcite for bent - core smectics in the bulk and proposing the corresponding surface energy terms .",
