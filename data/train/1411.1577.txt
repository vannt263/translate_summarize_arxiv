    "<S> this value of @xmath32 is clearly different from the peak temperature @xmath33 = 15.9  k in @xmath17 . in general , </S>",
    "<S> nmr measurements are very sensitive to a magnetic phase transition , but are not sensitive to a structural one if the sample is polycrystalline . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is most likely that the peak in @xmath17 corresponds to a structural transition , not a magnetic one , which changes the symmetry of the lattice and thereby releases the frustration . </S>",
    "<S> this then enables a second - order af transition at a slightly lower temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary neutron scattering experiment indicates symmetry lowering from cubic to probably orthorhombic in the low temperature phase  @xcite , supporting our scenario . the small shoulder in @xmath17 around 14  </S>",

    "<S> we also discuss this two - step transition from the viewpoint of the spectral line width in the supplemental material  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the results on ligacr@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the temperature dependence of the nmr spectra . </S>",
    "<S> a sharp line of the paramagnetic phase is observed above 22  k with the line width comparable to that of liincr@xmath1o@xmath2 . in the temperature range 13.516  k , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum consists of a sharp paramagnetic line and a broad line originating from an af phase , indicating coexistence of two phases . </S>",
    "<S> the paramagnetic component completely disappears below 13  k. although the spectra at 13  k and 8  k show a small peak near the center , it is likely from a minor non - magnetic impurity phase . </S>",
    "<S> the broad spectrum from the af phase further consists of two components : a relatively narrow line whose fwhm is about 1  mhz and a much wider one ( the solid and dotted arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) ) .    generally , the line width in an af phase is proportional to the magnitude of the ordered moments </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , temperature dependence of the line width provides information about how the af moments develop with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the gradual line broadening observed in liincr@xmath1o@xmath2 below 14  k ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) indicates a continuous growth of the af moments associated with a second - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3](b ) shows the broad components of the spectra for ligacr@xmath1o@xmath2 below 16  k. we can clearly see that all the spectra show nearly identical line shape except for small difference in the intensity of the wide component . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the af moments develop discontinuously and the magnitude of the ordered moments is independent of temperature once the transition has occurred , even though the macroscopic state is inhomogeneous mixing of the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the af transition in ligacr@xmath1o@xmath2 is first - order . the volume fraction of the paramagnetic phase changes gradually over a rather wide temperature range as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , the integrated intensity of the sharp paramagnetic line multiplied by temperature @xmath34 , which represents the volume fraction of the paramagnetic phase , is plotted against temperature ( red solid circles and blue open triangles ) . a small hysteresis is observed between the heating and cooling processes , supporting the first - order nature of the af transition . the gradual change of the paramagnetic volume fraction for 1320  k indicates distribution of the af transition temperature , consistent with the macroscopic coexistence of the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution function of the transition temperature obtained by differentiating @xmath34 with @xmath5 ( red crosses ) shows a peak near 14  k similar to @xmath17 reported in @xcite ( black dots ) .    </S>",

    "<S> 1/@xmath38 increases slightly with decreasing temperature at high temperatures without any sign of a spin gap in contrast to the result in liincr@xmath1o@xmath2 . with further decreasing temperature , </S>",
    "<S> 1/@xmath38 shows a divergence near 13  k , which indicates critical slowing down of magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> such a divergence is usually associated with a second - order magnetic transition and seemingly contradicts our conclusion for the first - order transition based on the temperature dependence of the nmr spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of 1/@xmath38 can be fit to the function @xmath41 derived for unfrustrated antiferromagnets near the transition temperature @xmath32  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , a second - order af transition is not expected . </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting result that ligacr@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath13 = 0.6 shows an indication of a second - order magnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , the transition at @xmath32 = 12.8  k is not realized , because the paramagnetic component completely disappears just before @xmath32 as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed transition is first order , and is probably an af transition with lattice distortion . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the recent neutron scattering measurements indicate symmetry lowering of the lattice in the lower temperature phase  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that ligacr@xmath1o@xmath2 exhibits a first - order af transition and at the same time , it is close to a critical point of a second - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior can be most simply understood if the system is in the vicinity of a tricritical point , which separates a critical line into continuous and discontinuous regions in the phase diagram as schematically shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xmath42 represents a phenomenological tuning parameter of the system . for a microscopic spin hamiltonian that describes the real material , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 should be a combination of the parameters such as anisotropy , spin - lattice coupling , and multi - spin exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the af transition temperature ( @xmath43 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ) observed in our experiments indicates a distribution of @xmath42 ( @xmath44 ) in the sample as represented by the gray area in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the distribution @xmath43 or @xmath44 is not understood yet . </S>",
    "<S> it could be due to extrinsic disorder in the sample .    </S>",
    "<S> the susceptibility of the order parameter @xmath45 diverges at the tricritical point  @xcite , where @xmath28 is expected to show a divergence due to critical slowing down . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution @xmath44 for ligacr@xmath1o@xmath2 must be located on the first - order side . </S>",
    "<S> even if @xmath42 slightly deviates from the tricritical point to the first - order side , @xmath45 shows a divergence toward a slightly lower temperature than the first - order transition temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath28 is expected to show divergence - like behavior just before the first - order transition . </S>",
    "<S> the coincidence between @xmath32 and the temperature at which the paramagnetic component disappears can be described assuming that the tricritical point is located at the lower boundary of the gray area as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> strong spin - lattice coupling in @xmath9cr@xmath6o@xmath1 ( _ a _ = zn , cd ) causes a first - order transition involving simultaneous af spin order and lattice distortion at 12.5  k ( zncr@xmath6o@xmath1 ) and 7.8  k ( cdcr@xmath6o@xmath1 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - jahn - teller effect has been proposed as the mechanism for these transitions . however , the experimental information has been limited due to the first - order nature of these transitions . </S>",

    "<S> to explore such possibility is a challenging future subject .    in summary </S>",

    "<S> in liincr@xmath1o@xmath2 with large breathing , spin gap behavior with @xmath27 = 31  k was observed in 1/@xmath4 at high temperature , which , however , is followed by a second - order af transition at 13  k. the af transition is likely to be assisted by a structural transition at a slightly higher temperature that changes the symmetry of the lattice and releases frustration . </S>",
