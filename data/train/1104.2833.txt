    "galaxy clusters are crucial to our understanding of the universe . for example",
    ", galaxy clusters have been used to derive the hubble constant , to discriminate between different cosmological models @xcite , to test the intracluster gas mass distribution and temperature profile , and to trace out the thermodynamical history using scaling relations among cluster observables @xcite .",
    "these studies often require modeling of cluster morphology and hence can benefit from a better understanding of cluster morphology .",
    "hypotheses about an object s three - dimensional properties are not easily tested through two - dimensional observations @xcite .",
    "one of the major questions about cluster morphology is whether it is spherical or triaxial @xcite .",
    "simulations have shown that dark matter halos are triaxial @xcite , and there is evidence from strong gravitational - lensing observations as well . moreover , some efforts have been made to reconstruct three - dimensional cluster morphology and correct the projection effect using observational data . in this paper",
    ", we examine the spherical and elliptical models of cluster morphology using the cosmic distance - duality ( dd ) relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also called etherington relation ) .",
    "the dd relation plays a fundamental role in observational cosmology , covering the analyses of galaxy cluster observations @xcite , gravitational - lensing phenomena @xcite and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite .",
    "the dd relation connects different metric distances via @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance respectively , with @xmath6 being the redshift .",
    "the dd relation is a general duality in all metric theories of gravity , as long as there is no sink or source along the null geodesics .",
    "one way to test the validity of the dd relation is to combine the metric distance results from both observations and theoretical expressions in a given cosmological model . @xcite",
    "proposed the idea of testing the dd relation using @xmath5 from x - ray surface brightness and sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) measurements of galaxy clusters .",
    "they concluded that there was no significant violation of the dd relation for a @xmath7-cold dark matter ( @xmath7cdm ) model .",
    "@xcite examined the dd relation with @xmath5 of 38 clusters from the @xcite sample .",
    "they defined @xmath8 $ ] and found @xmath9 at 1@xmath10 confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "thus , there is no violation for the dd relation in the framework of the @xmath7cdm model .",
    "with @xmath4 from data compilation of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , the dd relation was also used to constrain cosmic opacity by @xcite .",
    "they introduced a parameter @xmath11 to analyze the deviation of the dd relation in a flat @xmath7cdm model , by assuming that it satisfies @xmath12 , and got the constraint , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 cl ) .",
    "@xcite offered a method for testing the dd relation using _ wmap _",
    "( 7-year ) results by fixing the @xmath7cdm model . particularly , they considered two different geometries for galaxy clusters , i.e. elliptical and spherical models .",
    "@xmath5 of these two models were derived by the joint analysis of x - ray surface brightness observations plus sze data .",
    "their analysis was based on two parametric representations of @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "they concluded that the best - fit value for the elliptical model is close to @xmath18 at @xmath1 cl , whereas for the spherical model , the result is only marginally compatible at @xmath2 cl .",
    "more robust , another possibility of testing the dd relation is via the combination of different sets of observations that furnish both metric distances , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 , independently .",
    "@xcite made such kind of cosmological model - independent test of the dd relation with @xmath5 from galaxy clusters observations and @xmath4 from constitution sne ia data .",
    "they employed the @xmath5 data from two cluster models .",
    "the first model was defined by 25 @xmath5 of clusters @xcite using an elliptical @xmath0-model over the redshift interval @xmath19 .",
    "the second model contained 38 @xmath5 of clusters @xcite in the redshift range @xmath20 observed by _",
    "chandra _ and _ owens valley radio observatory / berkeley - illinois - maryland association _ interferometric arrays . for each cluster , they selected one sn ia which has the closest redshift to the cluster s , requiring that the difference in redshift ( @xmath21 ) is smaller than 0.005 .",
    "so a direct test for the dd relation could be allowed .",
    "they also referred to @xmath15 as the aforementioned two representations , and obtained @xmath22 ( @xmath14 cl ) for the elliptical model and @xmath23 ( @xmath2 cl ) for the spherical model .",
    "in a subsequent paper , @xcite also performed a cosmological model - independent test of the dd relation , using the most recent compilation which consists of 557 sne ia ( union2 compilation , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "compared with the constitution set used by @xcite , the values of @xmath24 are more centered around the @xmath25 line .",
    "furthermore , they assumed two more general parameterizations for the test of the dd relation , i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "finally , they obtained the conclusion that the dd relation can be accommodated at @xmath1 and @xmath2 cls for the elliptical and spherical models with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , whereas @xmath1 and @xmath14 cls by postulating two more general parameterizations for the two models .",
    "there are two aims of this paper : ( 1 ) making a cosmological model - independent test of the dd relation with two new methods using sne ia data from union2 compilation and galaxy clusters data from two morphological models reported by @xcite and @xcite , ( 2 ) testing the intrinsic shape of clusters if the dd relation is compatible with present observations . in this paper ,",
    "two new methods to obtain @xmath4 at cluster redshifts are employed : ( i ) fitting the union2 sne ia data with weighted least - squares and interpolating @xmath4 at each cluster s redshift , ( ii ) binning sne ia @xmath4 within the redshift range @xmath28 to get @xmath4 at the cluster s redshift . in doing so",
    ", we also take into account the asymmetric uncertainties in @xcite s @xmath5 data .",
    "furthermore , two cluster morphological models , i.e. elliptical @xmath0-model and spherical @xmath0-model , are tested .",
    "the latter model is divided into two groups in terms of the different reduction methods of the angular diameter distance data , i.e. conservative spherical @xmath0-model and corrected spherical @xmath0-model .",
    "to avoid limitations of any particular parameterizations of the deviation from the dd relation , four one - dimensional and four two - dimensional parameterizations are applied to the maximum likelihood estimation test .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly describe the sne ia data and galaxy cluster models .",
    "the analysis methods and results are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 gives our conclusions and discussions .",
    "[ figure1 ]    in our analysis , the validity of the dd relation is tested using @xmath4 and @xmath5 results from mutually and cosmologically independent measurements .",
    "two sets of @xmath5 data from x - ray and sze observations of galaxy clusters are considered . in order to get @xmath4 ,",
    "we choose the union2 sample of @xcite , which contains 557 well - measured sne ia . compared with the `` union '' sne ia compilation , the new compilation increases the number of well - measured distant sne ia by including the events discovered in ground - based searches during 2001 and then followed with the wide field planetary camera 2 on the _ hubble space telescope_.",
    "an important issue is that there are only eight sne ia host galaxies for which high - quality cepheid distance measurements are possible @xcite . in other words , although the sample in union2 compilation is sufficiently large , the calibration of sne ia still suffers from small number statistical uncertainty , due to lack of sne ia calibrators . in order to consider this uncertain absolute magnitude",
    ", we add an uncertainty of 0.05 magnitudes in quadrature as a covariance among all distance moduli of 557 sne ia , provided by _ _ supernova cosmology project _ _ @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite employed a moderate redshift criterion , @xmath29 , and selected the nearest sn ia for every galaxy cluster to test the dd relation statistically .",
    "however using merely one luminosity distance @xmath4 from all those available within the same redshift range will lead to larger statistical errors .",
    "five sne ia in the union2 sne ia compilation satisfy the criterion @xmath30 : sn2005fj ( @xmath31 ) , sn2005fw ( @xmath31 ) , sn1999bm ( @xmath32 ) , sn2005ld ( @xmath33 ) and sn2005gx ( @xmath34 ) @xcite .",
    "then how to choose one from the 2 sne ia at @xmath31 ? using both will improve the statistics .",
    "hence , as a generalization , we propose to use all sne ia @xmath4 within @xmath30 . ] instead of using @xmath4 of union2 sne ia directly , two new methods are adopted ,    \\(i ) fitting the union2 sne ia data and interpolating @xmath4 at each cluster s redshift ;    \\(ii ) binning the union2 sne ia @xmath4 within the redshift range @xmath35 to get @xmath4 at the cluster s redshift .    in realizing method ( i ) ,",
    "a quadratic fit is applied to all the data with errors under the principle of weighted least - squares fitting ( in other words , @xmath36 fitting @xcite ) .",
    "the fitting curve and its @xmath1 cl are plotted along with the original data in figure  1 .    as suggested by others @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath30 criterion is employed to select sne ia @xmath4 data .",
    "but in method ( ii ) , we take an inverse variance weighted average of all the selected data in the following manner . assuming that @xmath37 represents @xmath38th appropriate sne ia luminosity distance data ( within @xmath30 ) with @xmath39 denoting",
    "its reported observational uncertainty , in light of conventional data reduction techniques by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  4 ) , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for the weighted mean luminosity distance at the corresponding galaxy cluster redshift , and @xmath42 is its uncertainty .    to get reasonable results for cluster @xmath5 ,",
    "one has to assume certain cluster morphologies .",
    "the structure of clusters is an essential cosmological probe , as it plays important roles in discriminating different cosmological models via the mass density of the universe @xcite , and constraining the halo evolution models @xcite .",
    "moreover , different assumptions of cluster shape affect the measurements of baryon fraction significantly @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , a robust way to measure cluster @xmath5 is through the joint analysis of x - ray emission and sze .",
    "the hot intracluster medium interacts with cmb photons via inverse compton scattering , causing a change in the apparent brightness of cmb and a small distortion of cmb spectrum , i.e. the sze @xcite .",
    "this effect is insensitive to the redshift of galaxy clusters , particularly at high redshifts ( @xmath43 ) . in calculating thermal sze",
    ", one should consider the relativistic corrections .",
    "@xcite proposed a convenient analytical expression up to fifth order terms in @xmath44 .",
    "if the peculiar velocity of clusters is non - negligible , namely the kinematic sze , the relativistic corrections are presented by @xcite . mostly recently ,",
    "@xcite improve these corrections to fourth order in @xmath45 .",
    "two cluster models under different morphological hypotheses are utilized .",
    "the first model involves 25 x - ray - selected clusters , with measured sze temperature decrements @xcite .",
    "a marked triaxial ellipsoidal @xmath0-model is reconstructed to describe the cluster structure , as described by @xmath46 with @xmath47 defining the intrinsic orthogonal coordinates aligned with the three corresponding principal axes . @xmath48",
    "represent the axial ratios ( note that one of them is unity ) , and @xmath49 denotes the core radius along one of the principal axis . as a combination of _ chandra , xmm - newton _ and _ rosat _ observations , this data set consists of two sub - samples , one of which is comprised of 18 galaxy clusters with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the other sub - sample , analyzed by @xcite , contains seven clusters from the x - ray flux - limited sample of @xcite .",
    "the second morphological model includes 38 galaxy clusters in the redshift range from 0.14 to 0.89 , provided by @xcite .",
    "they modeled the electron density profile by a generalized spherical @xmath0-model , @xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 correspond to the two core radii which describe the inner and outer portions of density distribution respectively , and @xmath54 is a factor between zero and unity .",
    "the angular diameter distance data of every individual galaxy cluster with the two models are summarized in table 1 .    as reported by @xcite ,",
    "almost all angular diameter distances for the spherical @xmath0-model are followed by asymmetric uncertainties . according to @xcite , the sources of asymmetric uncertainties include non - gaussianity of the likelihood curve , nonlinear propagation , and some systematic effects . and",
    "thus , the real value of physical quantities of interest is biased .",
    "@xcite and @xcite addressed this issue by combining the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "as stressed by @xcite , the modeling uncertainties of the angular diameter distances presented in their table 2 , 4 and 5 , contribute to statistical uncertainties .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to make the following corrections and estimations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equations  ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) ) , i.e. @xmath55 .",
    "we also use the reported @xmath5 value as the expected value ( @xmath56 ) and the larger flank of each two - sided error ( max(@xmath57 ) ) as the standard deviation ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "hereafter we name the original spherical @xmath5 set the conservative spherical @xmath0-model , and the @xmath5 set , which has been applied a moderate compensation shift to , the corrected spherical @xmath0-model .",
    "results of the angular diameter distances with conservative and corrected spherical @xmath0-models are also listed in table 1 . separately",
    ", we extract an overlap sample of clusters that are analyzed by both elliptical and spherical models . the result from the overlap sample provides a direct comparison of two morphological models of galaxy clusters .",

    "@xcite gave a relation that describes the angular diameter distance determined from observations , i.e. @xmath64 , which reduces to @xmath63 only when @xmath65 , i.e. the dd relation holds with no violation . combining this relation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dadleta ] ) , it is straightforward to achieve the target equation for further statistical analysis , i.e. @xmath66 where the expression of @xmath59 is checked four times according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eta0_1])([eq : eta0_4 ] ) .",

    "more than one sne ia are used .",
    "thus the statistics is improved , especially for nearby cluster sample , e.g. abell  1656 . because there is no sn satisfying @xmath30 from the cluster cl j1226.9 + 3332 ( the nearest one is at @xmath73 ) , this object is excluded , and also removed from method ( i ) analyses for the sake of direct comparison between our two methods .",
    "our methods not only avoid double counting of any sne ia data , but also take into account all possible clusters data .    according to the results shown in figure 2 and table 2 , the consistency is clear between the dd relation and the elliptical geometry hypothesis , since the dd relation value ( @xmath18 ) is always within @xmath1 cl of the best - fit values of elliptical @xmath0-model using both methods .",
    "however the best - fit values of conservative and corrected spherical @xmath0-models depart from @xmath18 at nearly @xmath2 cl ( see figure 3 ) , especially for conservative spherical @xmath0-model ( both methods ) and corrected spherical @xmath0-model ( method ( ii ) ) .",
    "as to the overlap sample , the difference between the two morphological models are more prominent .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates good consistency between elliptical @xmath0-model and the dd relation , with the best - fit values for all parameterizations close to the dd relation value ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "for the two spherical models , the results in figure 5 show a rather marginal compatibility with the dd relation , which is slightly worse than the whole spherical sample results ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "statistical results of each sample using the two methods are listed in table 2 for comparison .",
    "the one - dimensional parameterizations of the deviation from the dd relation , i.e. @xmath59 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eta0_1])([eq : eta0_4 ] ) , may be somewhat restrictive in terms of the degrees of freedom . here",
    "the dd relation is tested with two - dimensional parameterizations of @xmath59 ,    @xmath74    where ( @xmath75 ) has the value of ( 1,0 ) if the dd relation holds .",
    "it is found that ( 1,0 ) falls in the @xmath1 region of all two - dimensional parameterizations for elliptical @xmath0-model ( figure 6 ) , regardless of the method used .",
    "however , for the conservative and corrected spherical @xmath0-models , the dd relation can only be accommodated at @xmath2 cl for both methods , except the result ( @xmath14 ) with method ( ii ) for the corrected spherical @xmath0-model .",
    "the results of the two - dimensional analysis of the overlap sample ( see figures 8 and 9 ) are in good agreement with those of its one - dimensional analysis .",
    "in fact , the overlap sample shows a stronger preference for the elliptical geometry , as the dd relation is almost always @xmath2 away from the best - fit parameters for the spherical samples .",
    "table 3 presents the minimum values of reduced chi square ( @xmath76 ) for each models with the two methods .",
    "generally speaking , it shows the fitting quality of the corresponding models to each sample of galaxy clusters .",
    "consistent with the results given by the best - fit values of @xmath61 in table  2 , the results of @xmath77 also favor elliptical model given the validity of dd relation , since @xmath77 of this model is much closer to unity than those of spherical models .    in sum ,",
    "not only does spherical models have larger departures of the best - fit values of @xmath61 from the dd relation value ( @xmath18 ) as shown in table  2 , spherical models also provide poorer fits than elliptical models do as presented in table  3 . in consequence , we argue that the galaxy cluster sample modeled by ellipsoidal morphology is a better understanding of cluster s intrinsic nature than those modeled by spherical morphology .",
    "[ figure6 ]    [ figure7 ]    [ figure8 ]    [ figure9 ]",
    "in this paper , motivated by the investigation on intrinsic structure of galaxy clusters , we have tested the validity of the dd relation using luminosity distances from union2 sne ia and angular diameter distances from two cluster morphological models , namely , triaxial ellipsoidal @xmath0-model and spherical @xmath0-model . in order to obtain more reliable results , two sub - samples of spherical @xmath0-model",
    "are analyzed according to different treatments of the two - sided errors of @xmath5 data , i.e. conservative and corrected spherical @xmath0-models .",
    "moreover , in order to directly compare these two types of morphological models as well as minimize systematic uncertainties of the test , we also conduct the analysis on the overlap sample , i.e. the same set of cluster individuals under both ellipsoidal and spherical @xmath0-models for electron density distribution profiles .    to test the dd relation ,",
    "it is assumed that @xmath78 . in practice ,",
    "the reduction of statistical errors is realized by two methods , ( i ) fitting the union2 sne ia data with weighted least - squares and interpolating @xmath4 at each cluster s redshift , ( ii ) binning the sne ia data within the redshift range @xmath79 to get @xmath4 at the cluster s redshift . in methods ( i ) and ( ii ) , the @xmath15 parameter is parameterized in four one - dimensional forms , @xmath80 .",
    "other four more general parameterizations are also considered , i.e. @xmath81 , which are designated to describe the two - dimensional admissible parameter space @xcite .",
    "maximum likelihood analysis is used to fit the parameters , @xmath61 or ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "our results show that for elliptical @xmath0-model , regardless of whether method ( i ) or ( ii ) is employed , the dd relation values ( @xmath18 or @xmath84 ) are always in @xmath1 region for all one- and two - dimensional forms . the results of elliptical @xmath0-model support the idea that elliptical geometry is more consistent with non - violation of the dd relation . in the case of",
    "conservative spherical @xmath0-model , with both methods , it is found that the dd relation value is only marginally consistent at @xmath2 with the best - fit values via one- and two - dimensional analyses .",
    "the result from corrected spherical @xmath0-model is that the dd relation can be accommodated at @xmath2 cl for one - dimensional forms except using method ( i ) , and similar results is obtained using both methods for two - dimensional parameterizations . in consequence , we can not prove that spherical @xmath0-model is compatible with the validity of the dd relation .",
    "nevertheless , it is noticed that these results may be to some extent significantly affected by some individual data points .",
    "for instance , if cluster cl j1226.9 + 3332 is still included in method ( i ) ( this object is naturally excluded in method ( ii ) for there is no sn ia satisfying @xmath85 ) , the conclusion will be transformed into that the dd relation can not be accommodated even at 3@xmath10 cl for conservative spherical model .",
    "this result is tremendously different from the original results shown in figures  3(a ) and 7(a ) .",
    "another example is cluster rx j1347.5 - 1145 .",
    "if we exclude this cluster from the overlap sample , and apply our method to this new sample , the results show that for conservative spherical model the dd relation can be accommodated at 2@xmath10 cl , and its @xmath86 give 22.470/15 and 20.204/14 for one- and two - dimensional parameterizations respectively .",
    "this result is not similar to our original results neither .",
    "thus some thorough investigations on the influence of every cluster on the global compatibility should be paid attention to in future work .",
    "furthermore , it is worth making a comparison between the two methods .",
    "our results demonstrate that the dd relation is compatible with elliptical @xmath0-model at @xmath1 not only for one - dimensional parameterizations but also for two - dimensional forms , regardless of the methods .",
    "there is no discrepancy between the two methods for conservative spherical @xmath0-model neither ; the dd relation can be accommodated at @xmath2 with the two methods .",
    "likewise , corrected spherical @xmath0-model has approximately similar outcome , using the fitting and binning methods .",
    "the results of @xmath86 are similar between the two methods , as presented by table  3 . accordingly , the two methods we used are self - consistent . with our analysis , the marked triaxial ellipsoidal model is a more reasonable hypothesis describing the structure of the galaxy cluster compared with the spherical hypothesis if the dd relation is valid in cosmological observations .",
    "@xcite discussed the sources of some statistical and systematic uncertainties capable of affecting the angular diameter distance measurements .",
    "the main origins of systematic errors are calibrations of sze , x - ray absolute flux and temperature , while the major statistical uncertainties come from sze observations , x - ray spectra and images .",
    "interestingly @xcite also pointed out that the statistical uncertainty by cluster asphericity has the largest effect , i.e. 15% on @xmath5 ( see table 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but will be averaged out when a large ensemble of clusters is considered @xcite .",
    "however , our main results tell that in describing the three - dimensional morphology of galaxy clusters , the elliptical @xmath0-model prevails over the spherical @xmath0-models .",
    "we argue that the current cluster sample with well measured @xmath5 is not sufficient large to average out the uncertainty by cluster asphericity .",
    "actually , several up - to - date observational work strongly support the triaxial ellipsoidal morphology for galaxy clusters , e.g. observations in x - ray and strong gravitational - lensing @xcite , sze imaging @xcite , etc .. recently @xcite proposed another candidate profile for the distribution of intracluster medium , known as nagai model , which is based on the well known nfw dark matter profile @xcite .",
    "although analytically non - integrable , this model can also reproduce observed intracluster medium properties through simulations",
    ". however recent observation is incapable of distinguishing between nagai model and elliptical @xmath0-model , due to limited spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "maybe with more advanced detection techniques in the future , people can learn more about the intrinsic morphology of galaxy clusters from direct observations .    _",

    "<S> the advantage of our methods is that it can reduce statistical errors . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the morphological hypotheses for cluster models , it is mainly focused on the comparison between elliptical @xmath0-model and spherical @xmath0-model . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical @xmath0-model is divided into two groups in terms of different reduction methods of angular diameter distances , i.e. conservative spherical @xmath0-model and corrected spherical @xmath0-model . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the dd relation is consistent with the elliptical @xmath0-model at @xmath1 confidence level ( cl ) for both methods , whereas for almost all spherical @xmath0-model parameterizations , the dd relation can only be accommodated at @xmath2 cl , particularly for the conservative spherical @xmath0-model . in order to minimize systematic uncertainties </S>",
    "<S> , we also apply the test to the overlap sample , i.e. the same set of clusters modeled by both de filippis et al . and bonamente et al .. </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the dd relation is compatible with the elliptically modeled overlap sample at @xmath1 cl , however for most of the parameterizations , the dd relation can not be accommodated even at @xmath2 cl for any of the two spherical @xmath0-models . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is reasonable that the marked triaxial ellipsoidal model is a better geometrical hypothesis describing the structure of the galaxy cluster compared with the spherical @xmath0-model if the dd relation is valid in cosmological observations . </S>"
