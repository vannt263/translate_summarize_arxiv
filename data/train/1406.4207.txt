    "<S> we present full characterisation of acoustic wave devices based on the fully synthetic crystalline material at the liquid helium temperature range required for the design of ultra low loss mechanical systems in many areas of research including frequency control and fundamental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> temperature coefficients of the effective elastic tensor of langatate ( lgt ) in lagrangian representation are determined for the temperature range @xmath0k . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian formalism is mandatory in the analysed situation since the expansion coefficients of the lgt are still unknown at these temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement method involves a set of high - quality resonators of various cut angles , and uses measurements of frequency - temperature relations to extract the temperature coefficients of the elastic tensor . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , power sensitivity of lgt resonators at cryogenic temperatures is determined and dominant loss mechanism is identified .    recently low temperature applications of piezoelectric bulk acoustic wave ( baw ) devices has drawn serious attention due to their extraordinary quality factors@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such applications include but not limited to frequency control systems@xcite , quantum hybrid devices@xcite and atomic force spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated@xcite that in most of these applications , and in frequency control in particular@xcite , thermal response of such devices is critical and requires further improvement . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> thermal coefficient of the utilised material have to be identified at the liquid helium temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> although langasite - type materials were initially developed as laser crystals , some of their properties make them very good candidates for frequency control applications . like other compounds of this crystal family , </S>",
    "<S> lanthanum gallium tantalite ( la@xmath1ga@xmath2ta@xmath3o@xmath4 ) or langatate ( lgt ) belongs to the same trigonal crystal class 32 as quartz , and as a consequence exhibits similar properties . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is piezoelectric with an electromechanical coupling coefficient two to three times greater than that of quartz . </S>",
    "<S> these properties make langatate ideal for variety of frequency - control applications including baw and surface acoustic wave ( saw ) resonators and filters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> baw lgt resonators have already demonstrated their efficiency as master resonators in very stable oscillators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since lgt - based devices exhibit similar low phase noise and high @xmath5 regimes as quartz devices , they can also be classified as a low - loss material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , such applications require careful selection of the material in terms of crystal quality . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be pointed out that lgt crystal can be made according to a purely synthetic process of growth whereas quartz crystal can not be reproduce infinitely from synthetic seeds . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the crystalline quartz quality degenerates after a few successive growths and a new start from a natural quartz seed is needed as well .    like gallium orthophosphate ( gapo@xmath6 )  @xcite or langasite ( la@xmath1ga@xmath7sio@xmath4 or lgs ) , </S>",
    "<S> lgt is still a subject of intensive research mainly because of its ability to be used for high temperature applications . </S>",
    "<S> unlike quartz , lgt does not undergo any phase transition up to the melting temperature of @xmath8c . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it relevant for sensor applications in high temperature environment , e.g. inside engines . </S>",
    "<S> a resonance frequency of any acoustic device is a function of elastic coefficients of corresponding material . </S>",
    "<S> since all these coefficients are temperature dependent , the knowledge of this dependence is essential for predicting resonance frequency sensitivity to temperature and corresponding stability . </S>",
    "<S> various methods have been used to determine such coefficients from phase velocity measurement by a pulse echo overlap method , or resonant ultrasound spectroscopy and combined resonance techniques  @xcite , or by means of laser ultrasonic techniques  @xcite . although application of these methods at low temperatures is associated with technical problems . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , elastic coefficients can be accurately identified from the frequency - temperature measurements of plate resonators based on corresponding material  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been used to determine lgt coefficients at room temperatures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an extension of this last method for trapped - energy resonators operating at liquid - helium temperature is carried out in the present work . </S>",
    "<S> + at low temperatures , the use of the lagrande description is mandatory because the linear thermal expansion coefficients of lgt are still unknown . in the lagrange description  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the material density involved in the fundamental equation of the dynamics is referred to the reference temperature in the undistorted reference state , on the surface of which the boundary conditions are also applied . according to this formalism , the stress - strain relationship is given by the following tensor expression @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an element of the tensor of elastic coefficients , @xmath11 represents the first piola - kirchoff stress tensor , @xmath12 is an element of a vector of displacement . </S>",
    "<S> the elements are given with respect to coordinates of a material point at reference temperature . </S>",
    "<S> elastic constants @xmath10 are temperature dependent and the corresponding thermal coefficients have been already determined at room temperature@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the elastic tensor @xmath10 determines eigenfrequencies of acoustical modes of mechanical structures . </S>",
    "<S> thus , thermal sensitivity measurements of these frequencies can be used to determine thermal coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the structure used in this approach is a baw plate resonator whose high quality factors ensure sufficient accuracy . to resolve the material anisotropy , resonators with various cut angles </S>",
    "<S> should be characterised@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the characterisation approach utilises another theoretical result , the tiersten - stevens theory@xcite that analytically describes eigenfrequencies of contoured piezoelectric plate resonators . </S>",
    "<S> the theory provides the relationships between eigenfrequencies of the plate vibrations and mechanical constants that have to be determined . a case of plano - convex plate resonators of the thickness @xmath13 and the curvature radius @xmath14 , or trapped energy resonators ( see insets ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ reson ] ) is considered in the study . </S>",
    "<S> predictions of the tiersten - stevens theory have been confirmed by many practical results collected over the last decades .    </S>",
    "<S> infinite plate acoustic thickness vibration of a certain type ( shear or longitudinal ) is fully determined by one wave - number that describes variation of the wave along the plate thickness , i.e. its overtone ( ot ) , resulting in the following eigenfrequency : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a wave - number along the @xmath17 axis , @xmath18 is the material specific mass , @xmath13 is the plate thickness , and @xmath19 is an effective temperature dependent elastic coefficient in the direction of the wave propagation ( @xmath17 axis in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is composed of the elements of @xmath10 that make impact in the propagation along the chosen crystal orientation . </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath14 and @xmath20 are defined at the reference temperature that is @xmath21k in the present study . </S>",
    "<S> for high values of @xmath16 , the piezoelectric correction , the second term in brackets , becomes negligible so that it could vanish . in the case of piezoelectric resonators </S>",
    "<S> excited electrically , @xmath16 should be odd .    </S>",
    "<S> the matrix of elastic coefficients is obtained from the elastic tensor by using the compression rule of indices : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26,@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the elastic matrix is entirely defined by nine coefficients , in the following form : @xmath31 that reflects all corresponding symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath32 for the lgt being a class @xmath33 element . for plano - convex plate finite resonators , according to the stevens - tiersten analysis , an eigenfrequency of a certain vibration type is characterised by three wave - numbers @xmath16 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath16 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are acoustic wave variations in @xmath17 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions respectively , @xmath39 is an eigenfrequency of a corresponding infinite plate , @xmath13 is the plate thickness , and @xmath14 is the radius of curvature . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ r003gf ] ) makes the measurable frequencies dependent on three temperature - dependent parameters , @xmath19 , @xmath40 , @xmath41.in fact , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are much less dependent on temperature than @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ r003gf ] ) that the infinite plate eigenfrequency @xmath39 can be calculated from the measurement results of finite plano - convex plates @xmath42 by combining three eigenfrequencies with the same longitudinal wave - number @xmath16 and different combinations of in - plane wave numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath43 the resultant infinite plate eigenfrequency is a function of only one temperature - dependent parameter @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is straightforward to relate temperature dependence coefficients of the elastic parameters with that of the resonator eigenfrequencies .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44th order temperature coefficients of the elastic elements and a plate eigenfrequency could be represented in the series form : @xmath45 which give a coefficients of taylor series expansions around the reference temperature @xmath46 with the simplified ( two index ) notation of the elastic matrix @xmath10@xcite . in the following only infinite plate frequency coefficients </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 are considered assuming correction ( [ r004gf ] ) is imposed . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is made due to the fact that @xmath40 and @xmath41 temperature dependences are negligible in comparison with that of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the relationships between first three lowest - order coefficients for an @xmath16th order infinite plate eigenfrequency and effective elastic coefficient @xmath19 are given as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are effective coefficients for the direction of the wave propagation . </S>",
    "<S> using these algebraic relationships , it is possible to deduce material temperature coefficients using the following recurrent linearization  @xcite : @xmath50 where elements @xmath51 are coefficients of eigenfrequency sensitivity to elastic coefficients @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that @xmath53 and products @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are of the order of @xmath57 . comparing this order to @xmath58 for the single coefficients @xmath59 , relationships ( [ r099gf ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be limited to the first order terms resulting in the straightforward relation : @xmath60    the overall identification procedure include the following steps : 1 ) temperature dependence measurements of resonant frequencies and fitting of frequency - temperature plots to @xmath61rd order polynoms ( experience shows that higher orders are not necessary ) . </S>",
    "<S> if possible applied this to three modes with wave numbers @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 ; 2 ) application of correction ( [ r004gf ] ) giving an eigenfrequency of an infinite plate ; 3 ) calculation of temperature coefficients @xmath66 of this frequency ; 4 ) recalculation of effective material temperature coefficients @xmath67 by solving ( [ r101gf ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the data set of @xmath68 values used in the following paragraphs is that identified at room temperature from @xcite . according to ( [ r002gf ] ) , this approximation is largely justified because frequency changes never exceed a few @xmath69 from room to cryogenic temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature coefficients of the elastic tensor of cryogenically cooled lgt are identified using temperature measurements of high quality plate resonators . </S>",
    "<S> a set of resonators with different plate orientations with respect to different crystal orientation ( crystal cuts ) are needed to capture anisotropy of these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the following crystal cuts in accordance with the ieee - std 176 - 1987 @xcite are used : y ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) , x ( @xmath71 , @xmath71 ) , z ( @xmath71 , @xmath70 ) , x+45 ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) , y+15 - 30 ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) , y-45 ( @xmath70 , @xmath75 ) . the corresponding euler angles ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) are given in brackets . </S>",
    "<S> the full list of characterised resonators and corresponding modes is given in table  [ modest ] . </S>",
    "<S> the measured modes belong to three classes : a@xmath78 - thickness quasi - longitudinal , b@xmath78 - thickness fast quasi - shear and c@xmath78 - thickness slow quasi - shear .    </S>",
    "<S> the resonators are fabricated according to a process that is very close to the conventional process for quartz baw devices : crystal orientation , crystal cut , plate rounding , lapping and polishing for a plano - convex surface type  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resonators are designed to have a resonance frequency on the 3rd ot of the shear mode of about @xmath79  mhz at room temperature . </S>",
