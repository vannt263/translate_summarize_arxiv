    "in the present paper , we have observed that the naive estimation of the interaction between the hyperon and the nucleon does not show the attractive central force at the intermediate range .",

    "the stable point in the manifold of the atiyah - manton configuration is investigated . by quantizing the fluctuation around it ,",
    "one constructs the quantum state which has the same quantum number as the deuteron@xcite .",
    "however , the jnr form is difficult to handle the modification of the long - distance behavior caused by the mass of the pseudo - scalar meson . at this point",
