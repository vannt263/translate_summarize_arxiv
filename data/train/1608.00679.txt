    "<S> this paper draws attention to a hardware system which can be engineered so that its intrinsic physics is described by the generalized ising model and can encode the solution to many important np - hard problems as its ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the basic constituents are stochastic nanomagnets which switch randomly between the @xmath0 ising states and can be monitored continuously with standard electronics . </S>",
    "<S> their mutual interactions can be short or long range , and their strengths can be reconfigured as needed to solve specific problems and to anneal the system at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the natural laws of statistical mechanics guide the network of stochastic nanomagnets at ghz speeds through the collective states with an emphasis on the low energy states that represent optimal solutions . as proof - of - concept , we present simulation results for standard np - complete examples including a 16-city traveling salesman problem using experimentally benchmarked models for spin - transfer torque driven stochastic nanomagnets .    * </S>",
    "<S> the use of ising computers to solve np - hard problems has a rich heritage in both theory@xcite and practice@xcite , and there is great interest in identifying hardware configurations that can efficiently emulate the ising model using cmos primitives @xcite , nanomagnets@xcite and nanomagnet - based transistor - like units@xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the possibility of a hardware implementation that does not just mimic the ising model , but embodies it as a part of its natural physics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it uses a network of @xmath1 `` soft '' nanomagnets operating in a stochastic manner@xcite , each with an energy barrier @xmath2 comparable to @xmath3 so that they switch between the two ising states , @xmath0 , on time scales @xmath4 where @xmath5 ns . the natural laws of statistical mechanics guide the network through the @xmath6 collective states at ghz rates , with an emphasis on low energy states . </S>",
    "<S> we show how an optimization problem of interest is solved by engineering the spin - mediated magnet - magnet interactions to encode the problem solution and to simulate annealing without any change in temperature simply by continuously adjusting their overall strength . as proof - of - concept for the potential applications of this natural ising computer , we present detailed simulation results for standard np - complete examples , including a 16-city traveling salesman problem , using experimentally benchmarked models for spin transfer torque driven superparamagnets . </S>",
    "<S> *    the ising hamiltonian for a collection of spins , @xmath7 , which can take on one of two values , @xmath0 , @xmath8 was originally developed to describe ferromagnetism where the @xmath9 are positive numbers representing an exchange interaction between neighboring spins @xmath7 and @xmath10 , while @xmath11 represents a local magnetic field for spin @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> classically , different spin configurations @xmath12 have a probability proportional to @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the temperature , and @xmath15 , the boltzmann constant . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , the system should be in its ground state @xmath16 , the state with the lowest energy @xmath17 . with @xmath18 , and positive @xmath9 , it is easy to see that the ground state is the ferromagnetic configuration @xmath19 with all spins parallel .    </S>",
    "<S> much of the interest in the ising hamiltonian arises from the demonstration of many direct mappings of np - complete and np - hard problems to the model @xcite such that the desired solution is represented by the spin configuration @xmath20 corresponding to the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> however , in general this mapping may require a large number of spins , and may require the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath11 to take on a wide range of values , both positive and negative . finding the ground state of this artificial spin glass is the essence of ising computing , and broadly speaking it involves abstractly representing an array of spins , their coupling , and thermal noise through software and hardware that attempts to harness the efficiencies of physical equivalence    @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these representations may take the form of abstract models of the spins , the use of random number generators to produce noise , and logical or digital adders for the weighted summing . </S>",
    "<S> if enough layers of abstraction can be eliminated , the underlying hardware will inherently solve a given problem as part of its natural , intrinsic operation and this should be reflected in increased speed and efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> here we describe a natural hardware for an ising computer based on the representation of an ising spin @xmath21 by the magnetization @xmath22 of a stochastic nanomagnet(snm ) , which we believe will compare well with other alternative representations such as the superconducting flux qubit@xcite or cmos approaches using primitives such as static random access memory@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these snms are in the `` telegraphic '' switching regime@xcite requiring the existence of a small barrier in the magnetic energy ( @xmath23 ) , that gives a small , but definite preference for a given axis , with two preferred states @xmath0 . in the absence of currents , </S>",
    "<S> these snms continually switch between @xmath24 and @xmath25 on the order of nanoseconds , and can be physically realized by a reduction of the magnetic grain volume@xcite or by designing weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ( pma ) magnets@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the response of such a monodomain pma magnet in the presence of an external spin - current in the direction of the magnet s easy axis .    </S>",
    "<S> how do we couple the spms to implement the ising hamiltonian of equation ? </S>",
    "<S> the usual forms of coupling involve dipolar or exchange interactions that are too limited in range and weightability . </S>",
    "<S> instead , one possibility is an architecture@xcite that uses charge currents which can be readily converted locally into spin currents through the spin hall effect ( she ) . </S>",
    "<S> these charge currents can be arbitrarily long - range and the total number of cross - couplings is only limited by considerations of routing congestion and delay . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings may also be confined to nearest - neighbors , simplifying the hardware design complexity while promoting scalability and retaining universality@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show ( supplemental b ) that the ising hamiltonian ( equation ) can be implemented by exposing each snm @xmath26 to a spin - current @xmath27 @xmath28 which has a constant bias determined by @xmath29 together with a term proportional to the magnetization of the @xmath30 snm @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding charge current can be generated using well - established phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a spin valve could be used to convert the magnetization @xmath31 into charge currents while the spin hall effect ( she ) provides a convenient mechanism for summing , weighting and converting charge currents into a spin - current . for the simulations@xcite in this paper we simply use equation without assuming any specific hardware to implement it , since it is likely that better alternatives will emerge in the near future , given the rapid pace of discovery in the field of spintronics , </S>",
    "<S> see for example@xcite . also , the transistor - like requirements@xcite for interconnecting the building blocks ( figure [ fig : fig2a ] ) could be met using cmos units if needed . </S>",
    "<S> the distinguishing feature of the present proposal arises from the intrinsic stochasticity of snms and their biasing through the use of weighted spin currents ( figure [ fig : fig1a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> how the snms are interconnected to implement equation can evolve as the field progresses .    </S>",
    "<S> getting a large system to reach its true ground state is not easy as it tends to get stuck in local minima@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is common to guide the system towards the ground state through a process of `` annealing''@xcite which is carried out differently in different hardware implementations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , systems based on superconducting flux qubits make use of quantum tunneling , which is referred to as quantum annealing@xcite , whereas classical cmos approaches make use of random number generators@xcite to produce random transitions out of local minima .    for our system of coupled snms , </S>",
    "<S> random noise is naturally present and can be easily controlled ( figure [ fig : fig1a ]    ) , causing the system of snms coupled according to equation to explore the configuration space of the problem on a nanosecond timescale . </S>",
    "<S> annealing could be performed through a controlled lowering of the actual temperature , or equivalently through a controlled increase in the magnitude of the current @xmath27 , even at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it has been noted that certain annealing schedules can guarantee convergence to the true ground state , but these schedules may be too slow to be used in practice@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paper only presents a straightforward annealing process and does not seek out optimal annealing schedules . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , as we show in one of our combinatorial optimization examples , we may find only an approximate solution which , however , may be adequate for many practical problems .    </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on two specific examples to demonstrate the ability of such an engineered spin glass to solve problems of interest@xcite : an instructive example based on the satisfiability problem ( sat ) , and a representative example based on the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first known np - complete problem is the problem of boolean satisfiability@xcite , namely , deciding if some assignment of boolean variables @xmath32 exists that satisfies a given conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) expression . finding </S>",
    "<S> the collection of inputs that makes the clauses of the cnf expression true is computationally difficult , but easy to verify .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that any given cnf expression can be mapped to a collection of ising contraints using the fundamental building blocks of not ( @xmath33 ) , and ( @xmath34 ) , and or ( @xmath35 ) each subject to the ising constraints given by @xcite : @xmath36 using these building blocks , a network capable of finding the truth table for xor ( @xmath37 ) was prepared ( figure [ fig : fig2 ] ) . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , the solution uses a naive method to construct the network and leverages the use of ancillary spins to represent @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the array of spins from figure [ fig : fig2b ] are connected as specified by [ eq : hnot , eq : hand , eq : hor ] , driven by a reference current @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> as the magnets explore the configuration space , their outputs are digitized and used to compute the overall energy of the system ( figure [ fig : fig2c ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the regions of zero energy correspond to solutions of the problem . </S>",
    "<S> the digitized outputs are aggregated to determine their probability of occurrence . by looking at the first three bits of the most probable outputs , the solution to the problem </S>",
    "<S> can be directly found ( figure [ fig : fig2d ] ) . while this problem helps convey the essence of the approach , a more demonstrative application is worth considering .    </S>",
    "<S> the decision form of the tsp is np - complete , that is , for a collection of @xmath1 cities , does there exist a closed path for which each city is visited exactly once that has a tour length less than some value @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> finding tours that satisfy this problem is computationally challenging and also of great practical interest . </S>",
    "<S> there are well - known mappings that translate the tsp to the ising model @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the following :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is a boolean variable that is true when city @xmath44 is stop number @xmath45 and false otherwise , and @xmath46 are directed weights based on the distance between cities @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian is mapped to a spin system by replacing each @xmath49 with @xmath50 and weights @xmath46 with @xmath51 given by .    </S>",
    "<S> if the interconnections between each city are symmetric , then a boltzmann machine with each of the @xmath52 states associated with an effective energy @xmath53 is realized , and the probability of the system visiting a particular state is proportional to @xmath54 . in order to find low - energy , optimized states , direct annealing of the glass can be performed . using the ulysses16 reference dataset@xcite , annealing of a problem specific magnetic array through control of the effective temperature </S>",
    "<S> was performed ( figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> two specific traits of interest arise , namely the energy decays in a sigmoidal relationship with the @xmath55 , and the specific heat of the system , @xmath56 , shows a defined peak about a critical temperature . at high temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the system is disordered and corresponds to high energy states ( figure [ fig : fig3c ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature is reduced , the system continues to explore the energy landscape on a nanosecond timescale while gradually converging to a low - energy solution . for the given annealing profile and simulation duration , a low - energy , </S>",
    "<S> though not ideal , solution is found to the problem , highlighting the heuristic nature of the optimization@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that in principle these simulation results could be obtained directly from actual hardware . </S>",
    "<S> for example , figures [ fig : fig2d ] and [ fig : fig3d ] could be obtained by continuously monitoring the states of the individual snms using spin valves .    </S>",
    "<S> for these engineered spin glasses to be of practical utility , there are many challenges to be overcome . </S>",
    "<S> routing congestion will limit the distance allowed between couplings . </S>",
    "<S> different topologies and routing considerations may be needed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the weighting of inputs can be based on an approach using programmable floating - gate voltages@xcite or perhaps with fixed voltages and programmable resistors . </S>",
    "<S> the fidelity of the programmed weights needed for robust solutions may impose challenges on the selected weighting schemes . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the propagation delay of these high - fanout signals must be balanced with the response time of the magnets in order for the system to be governed by . </S>",
    "<S> while flexibility in the allowed weights and number of couplings is convenient for encoding problems onto the model@xcite , discrete nearest - neighbor couplings still retain np - hardness@xcite and may simplify the hardware design , improving scalability , at the expense of increased encoding complexity and area . </S>",
    "<S> static power dissipation of the device during operation , especially for current based summation , must also be considered . </S>",
