    "@xcite the intrinsic transport properties studied on the basis of the dirac equation ( such as the quantum hall effect , @xcite the minimal conductivity , @xcite and weak localization corrections to the conductance @xcite ) therefore effectively probe the graphene band structure via the momentum difference @xmath1 relative to the k - points . on the other hand ,",

    "we systematically investigate the dependence of the electronic transport through ngn junctions on independent on - site potentials in the leads and in the graphitic region .",
    "since the transport at finite charge - carrier density is anisotropic and depends on the details of the normal electrodes , we also consider the case of zigzag ribbons with armchair interfaces [ figs.[fig1](c , d ) ] , and the case of real - space leads [ figs.[fig1](b , d ) ] .",

    "our results entail that a ballistic ngn junction can be insulating even when the charge - carrier densities in the leads and in the graphitic region are both finite .",
    "conceptually , this effect can be seen as the counterpart of the celebrated minimal , non - vanishing conductivity exhibited by a graphene sheet at the point of nominally vanishing charger - carrier density .",
    "@xcite    we identify a simple mechanism for this insulating behavior at finite charge - carrier density , which originates in the mismatch of propagating modes in the normal and graphitic parts of the system . in the transport across a ballistic interface , the transverse momentum is conserved ( modulo reciprocal lattice vectors ) , and the conductance probes whether there are propagating modes with the same transverse momentum on both sides of the interface .",
    "the conductance thresholds , hence , are intimately related to the band structure in the normal and graphitic parts of the junction , which restricts the transverse momenta of propagating modes .",

    "are fixed by the boundary condition on those sites at @xmath86 which have no link to left lead .",
