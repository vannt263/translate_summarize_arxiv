    "the dynamics of an ideal fluid / plasma is constrained by infinitely many constants of motion . among them",
    ", the helicity dictates the invariance of the topology of vortex lines ( in the present work , we assume a barotropic relation between the entropy and the temperature ; then , the helicity is conserved in every co - moving fluid element confining the vortex lines ) . according to noether s earlier work  @xcite",
    ", a conservation law comes from a symmetry property .",
    "here , a symmetry denotes an invariance of action , or lagrangian , for infinitesimal transformations ( reparametrizations ) of independent or / and dependent variables .",
    "the primary example is the time reparametrization invariance eliciting the conservation of energy in classical mechanics . in fluid / plasma theory ,",
    "the symmetry leading the conservation of helicity is known as the `` relabeling symmetry '' pertinent to the lagrangian labels of fluid elements ( independent variables on lagrangian coordinates )  @xcite .",
    "unlike the example of the time reparametrization , relabeling transformation is infinite dimensional , which resides in noether s second theorem ; see @xcite for extensive mathematical discussions around noether s theorem and advanced topics , and  @xcite for related applications of the relabeling symmetry .",
    "the aim of this work is to examine this classical relation in the relativistic framework .",
    "the reason why this practice interests us is because the conventional helicity is no longer a constant of motion in a relativistic fluid .",
    "the space - time distortion ( inhomogeneous lorentz contraction due to non - constant velocity of the fluid ) yields a `` relativistic baroclinic effect '' on a thermodynamically barotropic fluid , allowing a change in the circulation ( or , equivalently , the vorticity )  @xcite .",
    "yet , we can formulate a `` relativistic helicity '' , by which we can delineate the topological constraint on the vortex lines in the relativistic space - time  @xcite . as naturally expected , and as to be shown in sec .",
    "[ s : r - helicity conservation via noether ] , the conservation of the relativistic helicity is derived by the relabeling symmetry . the key is to establish the ` proper ' correspondence between the lagrangian frame and the eulerian frame ; the noether current ( being formulated by a lagrangian formalism of the action ) resides on the former , while the helicity is evaluated on the latter .",
    "interestingly , the relativity reveals this fundamental relation with raising caution about the treatment of the proper - time in the eulerian frame ; the covector eulerianized from the noether current is not divergence - free , whereas it is divergence - free in the non - relativistic regime ( so , it is often called a `` noether current '' in the eulerian frame ) .    to deal with a charged fluid ( plasma )",
    ", we consider the canonical momentum that is the combination of the fluid momentum and the electromagnetic ( em ) potential .",
    "the ( relativistic ) helicity is defined for the canonical vorticity that is the curl ( exterior derivative ) of the canonical momentum . formulating the action principle on the lagrangian frame",
    ", we can similarly relate the helicity to the noether current ( sec .",
    "[ ss : noether pl ] ) .",
    "however , the complete action principle , encompassing the kinetic part producing the equation of motion and em part producing maxwell s equation , becomes a mixture of the lagrangian kinetic term and the eulerian em term ( we , then , need the protocol in evaluating the variation of the em potential in the lagrangian sense for deriving the equation of motion and in the eulerian sense for deriving maxwell s equation ) .",
    "a solution to remove this inconvenience is to formulate the kinetic action in the eulerian frame , but then , we miss the notion of the lagrangian labels of fluid elements  @xcite .",
    "the action of the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , however , can be formulated fully on the lagrangian frame ( sec .",
    "[ ss : mhd lagrange description ] ) .",
    "this is because , in the mhd model , the em field ( in fact , only the magnetic field is included as a state variable ) is assumed to be co - moving with the fluid , and thus , maxwell s equation is not needed .",
    "the formulation of relativistic mhd action in lagrangian coordinates is another new product of this work ( see  @xcite for formulation of basic equations , @xcite for an eulerian action principle , and @xcite for applications in astrophysical computations ) .",
