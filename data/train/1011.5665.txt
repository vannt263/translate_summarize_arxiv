    "owing to their remarkable homogeneity in peak luminosity and light - curve shape , type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are considered excellent tools to measure luminosity distances in the universe , suitable to constrain possible cosmologies also beyond the converged @xmath7cdm model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , with sufficiently precise observations of sne  ia at low and high redshift the expansion history of the universe can be reconstructed and a possible time evolution of dark energy can be probed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thanks to extensive observational campaigns and sophisticated modelling efforts over the past decade , some convergence has been achieved about the origin of ` normal ' sne  ia . there is a widespread consensus on the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario of a white dwarf ( wd ) accreting matter from a non - degenerate companion until it approaches the chandrasekhar mass ( ) and ignites carbon near its centre .",
    "this leads to a thermonuclear runaway disrupting the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the explosions always occur close to , this scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed homogeneity among ` normal ' sne  ia . within this picture",
    "the ratio of nuclear - statistical - equilibrium ( nse ) material to intermediate - mass elements ( ime ) in the ejecta is likely the key parameter for both the width of the sn light curve ( through the opacity generated by fe - group elements ) and its peak luminosity ( through the radioactive decay of ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , this emerging picture has recently been challenged by the discovery of a handful of objects whose properties can not readily be explained within the  framework @xcite .",
    "these sne are characterised by high peak luminosities , a factor @xmath32 larger than in all other sne  ia ( @xmath8 ) . at the same time",
    ", apart from their comparatively low ejecta velocities they share strong spectroscopic similarity with ordinary sne  ia .",
    "to explain the early light curves of these events within spherical symmetry , a  mass exceeding 1  and a total ejecta mass in excess of 1.4  are required @xcite .",
    "the explosion of a super-  wd stabilised by strong differential rotation @xcite , or a merger of two wds , in sum again exceeding  @xcite , have been suggested as possible scenarios .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite argued that these events could possibly be consistent with -wd explosions if strong deviations from spherical symmetry are invoked , with the ignition point located far off - centre and the  distribution being very one - sided .",
    "alternatively , energy sources other than radioactivity may have to be considered .",
    "understanding superluminous sne  ia is not only a merit by its own , but has important implications for cosmology .",
    "spectroscopically similar to ordinary sne  ia , some of these events may have entered into the cosmological sn  ia data sets , especially at high @xmath9 where they are favoured by their luminosity and where the data quality is mostly poor . moreover , while they are apparently rare in the present universe , without a better knowledge of their progenitors and explosion mechanisms it can not be ruled out that superluminous sne  ia were more abundant in the past . since they may not obey the light - curve width ",
    "luminosity relations used to standardise sne  ia , they may introduce systematic errors in the reconstruction of @xmath10 using sn data .    with the observations of sn  2009dc presented in this work , a comprehensive optical and near - ir data set of a superluminous sn  ia becomes available , extending observations of the same sn presented by @xcite and @xcite in both temporal and wavelength coverage .",
    "this allows us to study the properties and evolution of one member of this class in unprecedented detail , and to put constraints on possible explosion scenarios .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  [ observations and data reduction ] the observations are presented and the techniques applied for data reduction and calibration are discussed .",
    "sections  [ photometric evolution ] and [ spectroscopic evolution ] are devoted to the analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of sn  2009dc , respectively .",
    "important physical properties of sn  2009dc and possible explosion mechanisms are discussed in section  [ discussion ] , before a brief summary of our main results is given in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "sn  2009dc was discovered in the course of the puckett observatory supernova search on ut 2009 april 9.31 at an unfiltered magnitude of @xmath11 , and confirmed on unfiltered exposures on april 10.42 at a magnitude of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "no object was visible at the sn position on images taken by t. puckett on 2009 march 21 to a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 .",
    "a classification spectrum taken with the telescopio nazionale galileo + dolores on ut 2009 april 16.22 revealed that sn  2009dc was a type ia supernova well before maximum light @xcite .",
    "the sn was reported to share similarity with sn  2006gz @xcite at pre - maximum phases in most spectral features , including prominent  absorption lines , but lower expansion velocities .",
    "the presence of carbon and the resemblance to suspected super-  sne  ia such as sn  2003fg @xcite was confirmed by @xcite based on optical and ir spectra obtained on ut 2009 april 18 and 19 .",
    "@xcite measured a peak absolute magnitude of m@xmath14@xmath3@xmath15 and a slow light - curve decline of 15 @xmath16 , and estimated an ejected  mass of at least @xmath17 .",
    "they concluded that the spectrophotometric properties of sn  2009dc are consistent with the explosion of a super-  wd .",
    "in spectropolarimetric observations presented by @xcite , sn  2009dc shows moderately strong polarisation in  and  lines , but small continuum polarisation indicative of spherical symmetry on global scales .",
    "the authors consider this as support for the explosion scenario suggested by @xcite .",
    "sn  2009dc is located in the outskirts of the s0 galaxy ugc  10064 ( but see section  [ 09dc host ] for an in - depth discussion on the host - galaxy interaction with the late - type ugc  10063 , and the expected stellar population ) , at a redshift of @xmath18 ( ned / nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/ ] ) .",
    "this is well within the hubble flow , and a kinematic distance modulus of @xmath19 mag is assumed , based on the average recession velocity of ugc  10064 and ugc  10063 corrected for local flow patterns ( see table  [ properties ] for details ) .",
    "the extinction towards sn  2009dc is subject to some uncertainty .",
    "narrow d absorption lines can be discerned in the spectra both at zero redshift and the host - galaxy rest frame , suggesting a non - negligible amount of dust in the line of sight .",
    "the respective equivalent widths are @xmath20 and @xmath21  , measured from thirteen early - time spectra .",
    "application of the formula of @xcite yields colour excesses of @xmath22 and @xmath23 mag in the milky way and the host galaxy , respectively .",
    "alternatively , consulting the @xcite dust maps suggests a foreground extinction of @xmath24 mag towards ugc  10064 , and we adopt this value for the galactic component . in ` normal ' sne  ia",
    "the colours measured at peak or during the tail phase are used to infer the total reddening caused by dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , as will be shown in section  [ colour evolution ] , the colour evolution of sn  2009dc differs significantly from that of ordinary sne  ia , so that these methods can not be applied with any confidence .",
    "given the high luminosity of sn  2009dc and its blue early - time colours already before correcting for any host reddening , we rather consider the value derived from the interstellar d lines as an upper limit for the actual host - galaxy colour excess . in the further analysis",
    "we therefore adopt a host - galaxy colour excess of @xmath25 mag as our best estimate , 50 per cent larger than the galactic colour excess as motivated by the ratio of the d lines . despite our multi - wavelength coverage",
    ", the unknown intrinsic colours of the sn also prevent us from determining the dust properties directly .",
    "we therefore adopt a @xcite reddening law with @xmath26 , assuming dust properties not too different from those in the galaxy as suggested by @xcite for normal sne  ia would reduce the inferred extinction in @xmath27 ( and hence the peak luminosity calculated in section  [ bolometric light curve ] ) by @xmath37 per cent . ] .      -band image of the sn  2009dc field taken with the calar alto 2.2 m telescope + cafos on ut 2009 august 13 .",
