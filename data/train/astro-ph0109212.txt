    "the interaction of a supernova ( sn ) with circumstellar medium ( csm ) produces a fast shock wave in the csm and a reverse shock wave into the outer supernova ejecta .",
    "two characteristic regions of x - ray emission are produced by the interaction : the forward shock wave in the csm at @xmath7 km s@xmath8 produces gas with @xmath9 k , and the reverse shock wave in the supernova ejecta @xmath10 km s@xmath8 less than the forward shock produces gas with @xmath11 k. the reverse shock is formed where the freely expanding supernova ejecta catches up with the csm shocked by the blast wave . at early times , the reverse shock front is radiative and a dense , cool ( @xmath12 k ) shell can build up downstream from the radiating region ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "the dense shell can absorb x - rays from the reverse shock region and reprocess them to lower energies .",
    "this scenario was supported by observations of type iib 3j  with ( zimmermann et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) and with  ( kohmura et al .",
    "the early x - ray spectrum at day 6 was hard , with @xmath13 k. at day @xmath14 , a softer component with @xmath11 k dominated .",
    "the emergence of the softer spectrum could be attributed to the decreased absorption by a cool shell ( fransson , lundqvist & chevalier 1996 ; hereafter : flc96 ) .",
    "the thermal x - ray luminosity @xmath15 of the shock heated plasma is expressed by the product of the emission measure , em , and the cooling function , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the plasma temperature , @xmath18 represents the elemental abundance distribution , and @xmath19 is the x - ray energy bandwidth . for",
    "spherically symmetric conditions @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , the radial coordinate , runs from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , the current outer boundary of the shocked matter which has an electron density @xmath24 . assuming a constant supernova shock wave speed @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 represents the time elapsed since the explosion .",
    "if the ambient matter density @xmath28 is dominated by a wind blown by the progenitor star of the supernova the continuity equation requires @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the mass loss rate and @xmath31 the wind speed .",
    "the x - ray luminosity can then be expressed as @xmath32 .",
    "we can hence use the x - ray luminosity to measure the ratio @xmath30/@xmath31 of the progenitor star .",
    "each x - ray measurement at @xmath27 is related to the corresponding distance from the site of the explosion .",
    "this site had been reached by the wind at a time depending on @xmath31 , or the age of the wind @xmath33 .",
    "usually , @xmath34 so that with @xmath27 only a few years we can look back in time quite an appreciably large time span in the evolution of the progenitor s wind . assuming that @xmath31 did not change over @xmath35 we can even directly measure the mass loss rate back in time . whether @xmath36 is a reasonable assumption will be discussed below .",
    "integration of the mass - loss rate along the path of the expanding shell gives the mean density inside a sphere of radius @xmath21 .",
    "for a constant wind velocity @xmath31 and mass - loss rate @xmath37 , a @xmath38 profile with @xmath39 is expected .",
    "after the expanding shell has become optically thin , it is expected that emission from the sn ejecta itself , heated by the reverse shock , dominates the x - ray output of the interaction regions due to its higher emission measure and higher density . for a uniformly expanding ejecta",
    "the density structure is a function of its expansion velocity , @xmath40 , and the time after the explosion , @xmath27 : @xmath41 with @xmath42 the ejecta density at time @xmath43 and velocity @xmath44 ( flc96 ) . for a red supergiant progenitor ,",
    "the power - law is rather steep with index @xmath45 ( shigeyama et al .",
    "1994 ; baron , hauschildt & branch 1994 ; suzuki & nomoto 1995 ; flc96 ) . for constant @xmath46 ,",
    "the radius of the discontinuity surface between the forward and the reverse shock evolves in time @xmath27 with @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the deceleration parameter .",
    "3j  in m81 was observed in 5 individual pointings with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and in 10 individual pointings with the high resolution imager ( hri ) onboard  ( trmper 1983 ) .",
    "total integration times with the pspc and hri instruments are 52.2  ks and 140.3  ks , respectively . assuming an initial explosion on march 28 , 1993 ( ripero 1993 )",
    ", the observations cover a period of 6 to 1821 days after the outburst . a detailed description of the data calibration and analysis can be found in immler & wang @xcite .    in order to investigate the rate of decline for 3j",
    ", we constructed a combined pspc+hri lightcurve , which is presented in fig .",
    "hri data were binned into 11 continuous observation blocks with 520  ks exposure time each to obtain satisfactory counting statistics .",
    "pspc data were binned into 9 intervals with 218  ks integration time each .",
    "the time - dependent background was determined by normalizing the total background map of the hri and pspc images according to the total source - removed count rate in each exposure interval .",
    "background subtracted source counts were extracted within the 90% radii around the fixed position of 3j . in order to reduce background due to uv emission and cosmic rays , only hri pi channels",
    "210 were used .",
    "an effective 0.52  kev band cooling function of @xmath49 ergs  @xmath50 s@xmath8 is adopted for an assumed optically thin thermal plasma with a temperature of @xmath51  k ( raymond , cox & smith 1976 ) . the equivalent count rate to ( unabsorbed ) flux conversion factor is @xmath52@xmath53 for a galacti column density of @xmath54 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "hri and pspc count rates were converted using a factor of 3 appropriate for the assumed source spectrum ( cf . immler & wang 2001 ) .",
    "hri count rate to flux conversion factors as a function of spectral model parameters are given in fig .",

    "the uncertainty of the hri ( pspc ) conversion factors for optically thin thermal spectra with temperature in the range @xmath55@xmath56  k ( cf .  [ introduction ] ) is 22% ( 19% ) .",
    "an increase in absorbing column from @xmath57 to @xmath58 increases the unabsorbed source fluxes by @xmath59 . assuming a 0.86  kev thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum ( corresponding to a temperature of @xmath55  k ) instead of",
    "a raymond & smith thermal plasma reduces the hri ( pspc ) conversion factor by 4% ( 1% ) .",
    "we will first discuss the observed x - ray lightcurve in the context of the shock - heated stellar wind model and explore other scenarios later . in order to derive the stellar wind age prior to the outburst , an initial wind velocity of @xmath60  km  s@xmath8 and shock front velocity of @xmath61  km  s@xmath8",
    "are assumed ( bartel et al .",
    "the choice for the stellar wind speed is justified by the fact that 3jis a type iib sn with a massive ( @xmath62 zams ) red supergiant progenitor ( e.g. podsiadlowski et al .",
    "typical outflow velocities for these progenitors are in the range of @xmath63  km  s@xmath8 , peaking at @xmath64@xmath65  km  s@xmath8 ( e.g. barnbaum , kastner & zuckermann 1991 ) .",
    "since the shock front catches up with the wind deposited by the progenitor with a speed of up to @xmath66 larger , the interaction front can be used to probe the stellar wind history over a period of @xmath2 years .",
    "our x - ray observations can hence be used as a ` time machine ' to directly measure the csm density during the last stages of the stellar evolution .",
    "[ f2 ] illustrates the change in mass - loss rate as a function of the stellar wind age .",
    "it can be seen that the mass - loss rate constantly declined from @xmath3 to @xmath4 just prior to the explosion .",
    "integration of the mass lost by the progenitor along the shock front gives the csm density at the given interaction radius from the sn site .",
    "the csm density distribution is illustrated in fig .",
    "it is found that the csm density profile is best described by a power law @xmath67 with index @xmath68 , assuming a spherically symmetric expansion .",
    "this is significantly flatter than expected for a constant mass - loss rate and constant wind velocity profile ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the results confirm previous evidence for a rather flat csm density profile during the first year ( @xmath69 , van dyk et al .",
    "1994 ; @xmath70 , flc96 ; @xmath71 , marcaide et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the observed change in the pre - sn history could be due to variations in one of the following parameters :    @xmath72  variations in velocity and/or temperature of the shocked csm may have caused changes in the x - ray output of the shocked region .",
    "this model was proposed to explain the radio lightcurve of 3j  ( fransson & bjrnsson 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , evidence for a @xmath73 decrease in the expansion velocity over the first @xmath74 years was reported ( marcaide et al .",
    "1997 ; bartel et al .",
    "this change in shock expansion velocity , however , would only lead to a @xmath75 increase in the mass - loss rate and can not account for the observed order - of - magnitude change .",
    "also , as the  soft x - ray band cooling function for optically thin thermal plasma emission is not very sensitive to the plasma temperature ( @xmath76 ; e.g. raymond , cox & smith 1976 ) , a change in temperature from @xmath55  k to a few @xmath77  k would be required to explain the observed change in the mass - loss rate history .",
    "such drastic temperature variations have neither been observed for sne nor have they been put forward by models describing the csm interaction .",
    "therefore , variations in either the shock expansion velocity or in the temperature accounting for the inferred evolution can be ruled out .",
    "@xmath72  a different scenario would be a non - spherically symmetric geometry caused by a binary evolution of the progenitor .",
    "observational evidence that the progenitor of 3j  was a stripped supergiant in a binary system has been presented based on the visual lightcurve , which can not be described by a single , massive star alone ( e.g. podsiadlowski et al .  1993 ) .",
    "in addition , `` double - horned '' emission line profiles indicate the presence of a flattened or disk - like expanding shell ( matheson et al .  2000a ; 2000b ) .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve also shows some significant deviations from the long - term @xmath0 behavior ( cf .",
    "such deviations have also been observed for sn 1979c in the radio regime ( montes et al .",
    "2000 ) and were discussed in the context of a self - colliding binary stellar wind model leading to the formation of a multiple shell - like csm profile ( schwarz & pringle 1996 ) .",
    "x - ray observations of sn  1979c , however , were not suited to address these questions ( immler , pietsch & aschenbach 1998 ; kaaret 2001 ) . similarly , a binary model for 3j  can not be challenged by the  data alone and no information about the long - term radio lightcurve of 3j  is available .",
    "@xmath72  alternatively , the observed evolution is caused by changes in the wind parameters .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve implies @xmath67 with @xmath78 , or , using the continuity equation , @xmath37/@xmath79 .",
    "the ratio @xmath37/@xmath31 therefore decreases with time approaching the date of the explosion , indicating either a decrease in the mass - loss rate , an increase in the wind speed or a combination of both .",
    "it is interesting to compare typical wind parameters for red and blue supergiants , which are on the same evolutionary track for massive ( @xmath80 zams ) stars ( e.g. salasnich , bressan & chioso 1999 ) . whereas the mass - loss rate at @xmath81 years ( @xmath82 ) is typical for a red supergiant ( e.g. @xmath83 for hd 179821 , jura , velusamy & werner 2001 ; chin & stothers 1990 ; schaller et al .",
    "1992 ) , the observed change in ratio @xmath37/@xmath31 by an order of magnitude at @xmath84 years could indicate a transition between the red and blue supergiant phase due to an increase in effective temperature of the star .",
    "blue supergiants are known to have significantly lower mass - loss rates and higher wind velocities ( @xmath85 , @xmath86@xmath87 ; e.g. kudritzki et al .",
    "this scenario for the evolution of the 3j  progenitor would have some interesting similarities with that of sn  1987a , whose progenitor completely entered the blue supergiant phase after significant mass - transfer to a companion ( podsiadlowski et al .",
    "1993 ) .    whereas our x - ray data alone can not give information on whether @xmath37 or @xmath31",
    "have effectively changed during the late stage of the progenitor s evolution , there is a clear difference between these possibilities regarding the kinetical energy of the stellar wind : using @xmath5 , the kinetical wind energy decreased by a factor of 13 for a changing @xmath37 during the observed @xmath88 years . in the scenario of a changing @xmath31 only , an increase in kinetical wind energy by a factor of @xmath89",
    "is expected .",
    "future stellar evolutionary models might give answers as to which of the two possibilities is more likely .",
    "let us explore the scenario that the x - ray emission is dominated by the ejecta , heated by the reverse shock .",
    "a necessary condition for the ejecta accounting for the observed x - ray emission is that the absorption by the post - shock gas is low . in this model , an ejecta density structure of @xmath90",
    "is expected ( flc96 ) .",
    "the total x - ray output of both the reverse - shock heated ejecta and the shocked stellar wind in the forward shock is then given by @xmath91 in the case where @xmath46 is large .",
    "in fact , using our inferred x - ray rate of decline of @xmath92 is entirely consistent with the above @xmath93 for @xmath78 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath46 must be large is hence confirmed by our data and has also been concluded from radio and optical observations of 3j(@xmath45@xmath94 ; shigeyama et al .",
    "1994 ; baron , hauschildt & branch 1994 ; suzuki & nomoto 1995 ; flc96 ) .",
    "it is important to note that if the density gradient for the ejecta is large , x - rays from the reverse shock must be heavily absorbed . whereas variations in temperature of the ejecta can be ruled out to explain the observed x - ray lightcurve ( cf . ",
    "[ wind ] ) , a change in absorption from initially @xmath95 to the galactic column of @xmath96 could account for the observed decrease in source flux ( cf .",
    "fig .  5 in wang , immler & pietsch 1999 ) .",
    "the signature of high absorption , however , is absent in all  pspc spectra of 3j , which are consistent with the galactic foreground absorption ( @xmath97 , zimmermann et al .",
    "1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "the most likely scenario is hence that the emission from the reverse shock is completely absorbed and that the observed soft x - rays are only due to the shocked csm of the progenitor wind .",
    "based on the modeling of the early x - ray lightcurve of 3j , fransson , lundqvist & chevalier ( flc96 ) concluded that the x - ray emission during the first months originates from the interaction of the sn shock with the circumstellar medium .",
    "as the reverse shock begins to penetrate the cool shell it is expected to contribute an increasing fraction to the total x - ray output .",
    "this predicted rise of the  band x - ray flux after @xmath98 days ( as illustrated in figs .",
    "8 and 10 in flc96 ) due to the emerging ejecta is not observed with .",
    "instead , the overall long - term x - ray lightcurve ( fig .  [ f1 ] ) is declining with a power - law close to the initial measurements , which were consistently explained as a result of the interaction of the sn shell with the ambient csm .",
    "we present the first detection of a pre - sn evolution in x - ray , based on long - term monitoring of 3j  with  over a period of 5 years .",
    "the data are fully consistent with a description in the context of the sn shock interacting with the csm blown off by the progenitor s stellar wind . from the x - ray rate of decline",
    "@xmath92 we infer a csm profile @xmath5 , which is significantly flatter than expected for a constant mass - loss rate and constant wind velocity profile ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the observations cover an epoch of @xmath99 years in the progenitor s stellar wind history . during this period ,",
    "the mass - loss rate of the progenitor has decreased constantly from @xmath3 to @xmath4 just prior to the explosion .",
    "the most likely explanation for this pre - sn evolution is either an increase in wind speed , a decrease in mass - loss rate or a combination of both , indicative that the progenitor star was undergoing a transition from the red to the blue supergiant phase .",
    "the data demonstrate the scientific potential of long - term x - ray monitoring of sne as an important diagnostical tool to probe the csm interaction and the evolution of sn progenitors .",
