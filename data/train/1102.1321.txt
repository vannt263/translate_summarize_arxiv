    "the auxiliary field method ( afm ) is a very powerful method to obtain analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of one , two and many - body systems . at the beginning",
    ", it was introduced to deal , in a simple way , with the worrying square root operator appearing in many relativistic theories @xcite .",
    "but we showed , in a series of papers @xcite , that it can be applied as well with great success in many physical situations . in this work",
    ", we focus mainly on the properties of the eigenenergies of @xmath1-body systems and the relations linking them .",
    "so , we will recall only the basic ingredients necessary for the understanding of the subject treated here , and we refer the reader to our review paper @xcite for an exhaustive overview of the method and its applications .",
    "many detailed discussions on the afm properties for @xmath1-body systems can also be found in @xcite .    a great advantage of the afm lies in its great simplicity and its ability to treat on equal footing the ground state and the various excited states . an analytical expression for these eigenenergies (",
    "the mass @xmath8 for a semirelativistic approach or the binding energies @xmath9 for a nonrelativistic one ) is particularly interesting from two points of view :    * it allows a very fast calculation in terms of the parameters and thus is very well suited if such calculations are a part of a chi - square determination of these parameters , a procedure which needs a lot of calls to the calculation of the energies . *",
    "it provides the behavior of the eigenenergies as functions of the various parameters and quantum numbers .",
    "this last item can be invoked to search for relationships between the eigenenergies of different systems with different sets of parameters : we call these relationships `` duality relations '' .",
    "they form the main subject of this paper .",
    "in essence , the afm replaces a problem which is not solvable , for example because of a complicated potential @xmath10 , by another one which can be treated analytically , for example by the use of a more convenient potential @xmath11 . in so doing ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce an auxiliary field @xmath12 which is an operator .",
    "the original hamiltonian @xmath13 is replaced by a new simpler hamiltonian @xmath14 , called the afm hamiltonian .",
    "if this auxiliary field is chosen as @xmath15 in order to extremize the afm hamiltonian , it can be shown that the afm hamiltonian coincides with the original hamiltonian : @xmath16 .",
    "thus , both formulations are completely equivalent .",
    "the approximation lies in the fact that the auxiliary field is considered no longer as an operator , but as a real constant @xmath17 .",
    "the value @xmath18 which extremizes the eigenenergy @xmath19 of the afm hamiltonian is then inserted in the corresponding expression to give an approximate value @xmath20 of the exact eigenenergy @xmath9 .",
    "an approximate state for the corresponding eigenstate can also be obtained .",
    "the quality of this approximation has been studied and discussed in detail in the papers mentioned above .    in this paper , we are concerned with systems composed of @xmath1 particles interacting via one - body potentials @xmath21 and two - body potentials @xmath22 , and moving with a nonrelativistic or a semirelativistic kinetic energy . although the afm can be invoked to treat this problem in such a general form , it is manageable in practice only if the particles are identical .",
    "this implies that they all have the same mass @xmath2 , that the form of the one - body potentials is the same for all particles @xmath23 , and that the form of the two - body potentials is the same for all pairs of particles @xmath24 . in consequence , the hamiltonian under consideration in this work has the following form @xmath25 in this expression @xmath26 is the position operator for particle @xmath27 , @xmath28 its conjugate momentum and @xmath29 the position of the center of mass of the @xmath1 particles .",
    "the only case which is entirely solvable analytically is a nonrelativistic system with quadratic potentials @xmath30 . with the natural choice @xmath31 ,",
    "the afm needs two auxiliary functions ( the prime symbol stands for the derivative with respect to the argument ) @xmath32 = @xmath33 = @xmath34 and @xmath35 = @xmath36 = @xmath37 , and the introduction of three auxiliary fields : @xmath38 to replace the relativistic kinetic energy by a nonrelativistic one , @xmath17 to replace the potential @xmath39 by the potential @xmath40 and @xmath41 to replace the potential @xmath10 by the potential @xmath40 .",
    "the minimization procedure giving the best values @xmath42 , @xmath18 , @xmath43 leads to a system of 3 coupled non linear equations ( see @xcite ) .    introducing the new variable    @xmath44",
    "it appears that the previous system can be recast under the form of a * single transcendental equation * which looks like @xmath45,\\ ] ] while the corresponding afm eigenmass is given by @xmath46 where the number of pairs @xmath47 has been introduced for convenience .    in these expressions",
    ", @xmath48 denotes the principal quantum number . concerning this point ,",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "the system being described by @xmath49 jacobi internal coordinates , the most general excited state depends on @xmath49 radial quantum numbers @xmath3 and @xmath49 orbital quantum numbers @xmath4 , as well as intermediate coupling quantum numbers which are not considered here .",
    "the afm relying on a quadratic potential , the principal quantum number resulting from the afm treatment is naturally @xmath50 in particular , the ground state for a @xmath1-boson system is just @xmath51 , while the ground state of a @xmath1-fermion system is much more involved and needs the introduction of the fermi level @xcite .    in a two - body system",
    ", @xmath48 reduces to @xmath52 .",
    "but it is possible in this case to use other forms for @xmath11 leading to other expressions for @xmath48 .",
    "for instance , @xmath53 with @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 for s - states with @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the @xmath58 zero of the airy function ai @xcite",
    ". moreover , it has been shown ( for @xmath59 in @xcite and for arbitrary @xmath1 in @xcite ) that a much better approximation of the exact energies can be obtained with a slight modification of the principal quantum number . a particularly simple form which works quite well is given by @xmath60 in the following , we consider the principal quantum number @xmath48 as a variable by its own in all the computations , and only at the very end of the calculation we replace this undetermined variable by the most precise one @xmath61 as in ( [ eq : princnumoh ] ) or in ( [ eq : princnumod ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , for such a complicated and sophisticated system , the only difficulty to get the afm approximate solution needs to solve the transcendental equation ( [ eq : trans1 ] ) , a quite easy procedure numerically .",
    "moreover , in a number of interesting cases , this solution is analytical so that the mass itself ( given by ( [ eq : genmass ] ) ) is also analytical .    in general , the potential @xmath39 ( or @xmath10 ) depends on physical parameters @xmath62 and should be noted more precisely @xmath63 .",
    "the other parameters of the problem are the number of particles @xmath1 and the mass @xmath2 of the particles .",
    "lastly , we want to have a description of the whole spectrum , so that the principal quantum number @xmath48 also enters the game . in consequence , a complete notation for the eigenmasses would be @xmath64 .",
    "let us stress now a very important point : for realistic potentials , the parameters @xmath65 could depend on @xmath1 or / and @xmath2 .",
    "we do not consider such a particular behavior here .",
    "thus , in this paper , we assume that * the parameters of the potentials are independent of @xmath1 and @xmath2*. this means that the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath13 is only through the kinetic energy and its @xmath1 dependence through the numbers of terms in the summation . in this paper",
    ", we suppose that the potentials are given once for all and consider that their form and parameters do not vary for all studied systems .",
    "therefore we are finally interested only by the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath48 dependence of the eigenmasses and use the simplified notation @xmath66 .",
    "the two - body problem , @xmath59 , deserves a special treatment . in this case",
    "@xmath67 so that @xmath68 = @xmath69 = @xmath70 .",
    "thus , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the inter - distance between the particles .",
    "we can then write @xmath73 . in consequence , the distinction between one - body and two - body potentials becomes irrelevant and it is sufficient to deal with only one type of potential and , depending on the situation under consideration , we will choose the most convenient one for our purpose .    moreover , the semirelativistic kinetic energy writes ( @xmath74 is the conjugate momentum of the relative distance @xmath75 ) @xmath76 , with @xmath77 for one - body systems and @xmath78 for two - body systems .",
    "however , we found very convenient to consider the @xmath79 parameter as a free real parameter , because the eigenenergy can be calculated as well as a function of @xmath79 .",
    "this possibility leads to interesting properties .",
    "thus , eigenmasses of the systems with the previous form of the kinetic energy will be noted @xmath80 while the notation @xmath81 is reserved to the natural definition @xmath82 = @xmath83 .",
    "what we call a `` duality relation '' is just a relation between @xmath66 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the search for such duality relations is the subject of this paper . of course , these duality relations are exact only for the afm approximation of a given problem .",
    "however , since this approximation may be , under many circumstances , a rather accurate result of the exact eigenvalues , our hope is that these duality relations remain approximately valid for the exact results and thus represent a rough view of reality .",
    "in particular , starting with the expression for a two - body system , whose calculation is rather easy , one can hope that the main trends for a @xmath1-body system are reachable as the consequence of the duality relations .    in the next section ,",
    "we discuss duality relations in the general case , while in the 3rd and 4th sections , we investigate the particular cases of ultrarelativistic systems and nonrelativistic systems , respectively .",
    "their interconnexion is investigated in detail in the 5th section . in the 6th section",
    ", applications are given while conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "some checks of the duality relations obtained are performed with explicit afm solutions in the appendix .",
    "in this section , we show that it is possible to solve formally the transcendental equation ( [ eq : trans1 ] ) and express the afm mass ( [ eq : genmass ] ) under a more compact form . in order to do that",
    ", we switch from the @xmath86 variable to the @xmath87 variable defined by @xmath88 with this definition , it is easy to calculate the following quantities : @xmath89 let us introduce now , instead of potentials @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the related potentials @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 by @xmath95 it is easy to prove that the transcendental equation ( [ eq : trans1 ] ) can be recast under the reduced form @xmath96    the new step of our procedure is the introduction of an inverse function @xmath97 , which is defined through the relation @xmath98 one can thus express formally the value of @xmath87 in term of the @xmath97 function as @xmath99 the eigenmass follows from ( [ eq : genmass ] ) introducing rather the @xmath87 variable . explicitly , @xmath100    the last step of our treatment is the introduction of the @xmath101 function as @xmath102 one sees that the eigenmass is expressed simply in a very compact form @xmath103 it is astonishing that the eigenmass of such a complicated system , even in its afm approximation , can be expressed in such a compact form in term of a single function @xmath104 .",
    "however , this enthusiastic conclusion must be moderated by the following remarks :    * the @xmath101 function is expressed through the @xmath97 function which , itself , needs the inversion of a function which contains a square root and a potential with a complicated form ; this can be a tremendous task .",
    "the effort of solving the transcendental equation ( [ eq : trans1 ] ) is replaced by the inversion procedure ( [ eq : defa ] ) , which is formally as much as complicated . * as seen from ( [ eq : defnewpot ] ) , the @xmath97 function , and hence the @xmath101 function , depends not only on the considered potentials  an unavoidable ingredient  but also on @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath48 , and should be noted more precisely @xmath105 .",
    "this means that this function depends not only on the considered systems ( through the potentials , and @xmath1 and @xmath2 variables ) but also on the particular excitation state @xmath48 .    in consequence of these arguments",
    ", it appears that this formulation is of no practical use and do not lead to duality relations ( at least we did not succeed to find one ! ) .",
    "however , we gave this demonstration because , independently of the formal esthetical presentation , it represents the prototype of many similar approaches that will be extensively used in the following sections .      in absence of two - body interaction ,",
    "@xmath106 , simplifications occur and one can draw interesting conclusions . instead of the @xmath87 variable ,",
    "let us use rather the @xmath107 variable ( which is called the mean radius ) defined by @xmath108 with this new variable , the transcendental equation ( [ eq : transred ] ) and the mass expression ( [ eq : massy ] ) are replaced by the following ones @xmath109.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , we do not want to get a compact closed formula ( one thus has to derive @xmath107 from the first equation giving @xmath110 and inserting it in the second equation to get @xmath66 ) .",
    "we prefer to express in the same form the case of a system of @xmath111 particles of mass @xmath112 interacting with the * same one - body potential * @xmath39 ( do nt forget that it is @xmath1 and @xmath2 independent ) in a state of excitation @xmath113 .",
    "we thus have @xmath114.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , let us choose the parameters @xmath115 as @xmath116 inserting these values in ( [ eq : trans2p ] ) gives exactly equation ( [ eq : trans2n ] ) with @xmath117 in place of @xmath107 .",
    "we suppose that the function @xmath118 is monotonic in @xmath119 for physical values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( here @xmath120 = @xmath121 ) ; this is always the case in practice .",
    "since we have @xmath122 = @xmath123 , this implies @xmath124 . inserting these values of @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath117 in ( [ eq : mass2p ] ) , it appears that @xmath125 = @xmath126 .",
    "we are thus led to the following duality relation between the @xmath1-body and @xmath111-body systems governed by the same one - body potential @xmath127 it means that the spectrum of a @xmath1-body system is the same as the spectrum of a @xmath111-body system ( with the same particle mass and the same form of the one - body potential ) provided we look at different excitation states .",
    "formula ( [ eq : dualpn1 ] ) tells that the energy is equally divided on all the particles .",
    "this is formally exact for arbitrary values of the principal quantum number @xmath48 ; however if one relies on the value @xmath6 as in ( [ eq : princnumoh ] ) , there is no certainty that @xmath128 appears still under the form ( [ eq : princnumoh ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , as we already stressed , we must make the calculation of the @xmath111-body system in term of an informal @xmath48 and not trying to fit the spectrum of the system , then make the replacement @xmath129 to get formally @xmath66 and , lastly , use in this expression the value of @xmath61 that fits at best the spectrum .",
    "these comments are important ; in the following we must keep them in mind for all duality relations .",
    "let us consider a 2-body system , which is the most simple system to be studied .",
    "to apply the previous formula , one must take some caution with the definition of the potential since @xmath130 .",
    "thus , if @xmath81 is the eigenenergy resulting from the hamiltonian @xmath131 ( which has the form of a spinless salpeter equation with a two - body potential @xmath91 ) , the calculation for @xmath66 must be done with one - body potential @xmath132 .",
    "this means that the determination of the mass of the @xmath1-body system results rather from the equations @xmath133.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it could be interesting to deal with the quantity @xmath134 , eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath135 . in this case",
    ", @xmath136 is given by the following set of equations @xmath137 putting the value @xmath138 and @xmath139 into the previous equations , one sees that we recover ( [ eq : trans3n ] ) provided that @xmath107 = @xmath117 and , then , @xmath136 = @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , one has the duality relation @xmath141 this relation is particularly interesting because it is valid whatever the value of @xmath79 . in particular , the special value @xmath78 gives the link between @xmath142 and @xmath143 , as in ( [ eq : dualpn1 ] ) .",
    "choosing the value @xmath144 leads to the duality relation @xmath145 in this case , there is a one - to - one correspondence of the spectrum at the price of considering systems with different particle masses .",
    "the conclusion is that , if @xmath136 or @xmath143 can be evaluated analytically , the same property holds for @xmath142 .",
    "we consider now the case of systems governed only by two - body forces , @xmath146 .",
    "one can model our reasoning on the demonstrations given in the previous section . in this case",
    "the natural variable is the mean radius @xmath147 with this new variable , the transcendental equation ( [ eq : transred ] ) and the mass expression ( [ eq : massy ] ) are replaced by the following ones @xmath148.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    exactly in the same way as the proof given before , one arrives at the following duality relation between the @xmath1-body and the @xmath111-body systems with particles interacting via the * same two - body interaction * @xmath149 in this case , the spectrum of the @xmath1-body system is the same as the @xmath111-body system ( with the same two - body potential ) provided we consider different particle masses in both situations and for other excitation states .",
    "the link between @xmath142 and @xmath136 now looks like @xmath150 here again , this relation is valid whatever the value of @xmath79 . in particular",
    ", the special value @xmath78 gives the link between @xmath142 and @xmath143 , as resulting from  ( [ eq : dualpn4 ] ) with @xmath151 .",
    "alternatively , one can use for instance this freedom on @xmath79 to choose the same mass in both systems ( this was not possible with the expression @xmath143 ) ; indeed , with the choice @xmath152 , one has @xmath153 choosing @xmath154 allows to express the duality relation keeping the same principal number in both systems @xmath155      we consider the case of a * @xmath1-body system * with particles of mass @xmath2 and interacting with a * two - body interaction @xmath156 only*. the corresponding mass for a state of excitation number @xmath48 , @xmath66 , is given by the set of equations ( [ eq : trans4n ] ) and ( [ eq : mass4n ] ) .",
    "now we consider the case of a @xmath1-*body system * with particles of mass @xmath112 and interacting with * one - body interaction of the form * @xmath157 only ( @xmath158 being a constant ) .",
    "the comparison for the mass of both systems may present some interest : for example in 3-quark systems , the case @xmath159 corresponds to the so - called @xmath93 confinement potential with the junction point placed at the center of mass , while the case @xmath160 ( in this case @xmath161 ) corresponds to the alternative description of confinement named the @xmath162 potential @xcite . in this case , the corresponding mass for a state of excitation number @xmath113 , @xmath163 is given by the set of equations ( [ eq : trans2p ] ) and ( [ eq : mass2p ] ) with @xmath164 .    if one chooses the mass and principal quantum numbers fulfilling the following relations @xmath165 it is easy to show that ( [ eq : trans2p ] ) is transformed into ( [ eq : trans4n ] ) while @xmath166 is transformed into @xmath167",
    ". therefore we arrive at the following interesting duality relation @xmath168",
    "the case of ultrarelativistic systems , characterized by a vanishing mass @xmath169 , presents some very specific and interesting features .",
    "for instance , the case of systems composed of gluons or / and light quarks can be well represented in this scheme @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is then @xmath170    indeed , the formulation is simpler for this particular situation . putting the value @xmath169 in ( [ eq : trans1 ] ) and ( [ eq : genmass ] ) , one gets a new set of equations .",

    "one can mimic there the approach followed in section [ sec : compf ] .",

    "we can now check if relation ( [ eq : dualun1 ] ) is , at least approximately , verified with @xmath342 and @xmath151 for the ( nearly ) exact solutions of this system . a priori",
    ", we could expect that @xmath389 .",
    "the calculation gives @xmath390 this must be compared with ( [ m3test ] ) .",
    "since @xmath391 , the relative error is around 15% .",
    "but , we can also hope that @xmath392 .",
    "the calculation gives @xmath393 this must be compared with ( [ m2test ] ) .",
    "since @xmath394 , the relative error is also around 15% . in these cases , we can consider that the relevance of the duality relation is demonstrated .",
    "the eigensolutions of these two two - body hamiltonians @xmath395 are given respectively by @xmath396 relation ( [ tenur1 ] ) is exact while the relative accuracy of ( [ tenur2 ] ) is around 1 - 2% .",
    "if we impose @xmath397 , the duality relation presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : passnru ] is verified by setting @xmath398 as shown above .",
    "let us examine what becomes this property for the genuine solutions .",
    "if we assume that @xmath399 is known , we can compute the exact solutions of @xmath400 with @xmath401 . for @xmath402 and @xmath403 ,",
    "the relative error compared to ( [ tenur2 ] ) is below 10% .",
    "on the contrary , if we assume that @xmath186 is known , we can compute the exact solutions of @xmath404 with @xmath405 . for @xmath402 and @xmath403 , the relative error",
    "compared to ( [ tenur1 ] ) can then reach 38% . following the physical situation considered , the accuracy of this kind of duality relation can strongly vary .",
    "but , in some cases , the error could be quite small .",
    "in this paper , we investigate the possible relationships between the energies of particular states for a given system and the energies of other states for another system .",
    "we call these relationships  duality relations \" .",
    "systems with arbitrary number of particles are considered but in a well defined framework .",
    "the basic hypotheses are the following ones :    * all the particles of the studied systems are identical .",
    "* we do not take into account internal degrees of freedom for particles and , for convenience , we focus only on bosons in applications ( the case of fermions can be dealt with as well , but it is more involved and is not studied in this work ) .",
    "* we consider the kinetic energy operator either of a nonrelativistic form or of a semirelativistic form .",
    "* we limit ourselves to one - body and two - body types of potentials .",
    "* the potentials do not lead to coupled channel equations , so that we are faced with a schrdinger equation for a nonrelativistic kinetic energy , and with a spinless salpeter equation for a semirelativistic kinetic energy . *",
    "the potentials entering the formalism do not depend on the mass @xmath2 nor on the number of particles @xmath1 .    despite the limitations ,",
    "the number of systems which can be concerned by this work is quite large and may represent a lot of different physical situations .    as an intermediate tool",
    ", we introduce the auxiliary field method ( afm ) to get approximate values of the eigenenergies .",
    "the important parameters are the mass @xmath2 and the principal quantum number @xmath6 , function of the various radial quantum numbers @xmath3 and orbital quantum numbers @xmath4 .",
    "the form of this function is not given by the theory and is left to the cleverness of the physicist .",
    "usually , the harmonic oscillator prescription ( [ eq : princnumoh ] ) is a good starting point , but a more elaborated formula , such as the one given by ( [ eq : princnumod ] ) , can improve substantially the quality of the results .",
    "the afm provides an expression @xmath5 of the eigenenergies ( or eigenmasses for a semirelativistic kinematics ) in terms of these parameters . in a series of papers @xcite",
    ", we proved that , the afm approximation can be calculated analytically for many systems and leads to encouraging results .",
    "a duality relation is , at the beginning , a link between afm approximations @xmath5 and @xmath7 .",
    "the case @xmath151 is particularly important because the corresponding duality relation allows to obtain the spectrum of a @xmath1-body system in terms of the spectrum of a 2-body system , a much more favorable situation .",
    "we obtained very general duality relations when only one - body or two - body potentials are present .",
    "more interesting conclusions can be drawn in the ultrarelativistic limit ( @xmath169 ) or in the nonrelativistic limit . in these particular cases",
    ", we showed that the afm results can be expressed in term of a unique universal function for a given potential and for a given kinematics .",
    "this crucial feature has a lot of important consequences for the duality relations .",
    "we proved for example that the spectrum of a nonrelativistic system governed by a two - body potential ( the same property holds for a one - body potential ) @xmath10 is the same as the spectrum of an ultrarelativistic system governed by a two - body potential @xmath406 provided that the parameter @xmath288 is chosen adequately .",
    "the nonrelativistic kinematics allows additional sympathetic features .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the spectrum of such a @xmath1-body system can be obtained from the ground state of the corresponding two - body system .",
    "the duality relations presented here are exact for the afm approximation of the eigenenergies . assuming that this approximation leads to results close to the exact ones , the duality relations can also be applied to the exact states .",
    "this means that we have an * approximate * link between the exact energies of a @xmath1-body system @xmath0 and the exact energies of a @xmath111-body system @xmath407 .",
    "the case @xmath151 is specially interesting because nowadays we are able to get easily the spectrum of a two - body system numerically with a great accuracy .    in particular , for a nonrelativistic system",
    ", we obtained a very important conclusion .",
    "the whole spectrum of any system ( arbitrary @xmath1 value ) can be calculated , approximatively , through a universal function @xmath333 which is nothing else than the dependence of the ground state of the two - body system ( with the same potential ) on the mass .",
    "this function is very easy to obtain numerically in any circumstances .",
    "the duality relation is expressed by equation ( [ eq : dualepsnln2 ] ) .",
    "it is sufficient for obtaining the searched value @xmath0 to calculate the universal function for an argument @xmath352 given by ( [ eq : defmassnl ] ) .",
    "the important point that we want to stress is the following one .",
    "the duality relations are exact for the afm approximations of the eigenenergies while they are only approximately true for the exact eigenenergies ( the quality probably deteriorates with increasing values of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this drawback is compensated by the fact that the corresponding duality relations concern the exact eigenenergies without any reference to the afm expressions which were only an intermediate tool .",
    "thus , the consequences of duality relations would remain true independently of the afm approximations .",
    "we propose to apply all the duality relations presented above for the exact eigenvalues , but only in an approximate way .",
    "the duality relations have been tested in a number of interesting cases .",
    "in particular , using a linear potential for @xmath59 and 3 , we showed that they are fulfilled with an accuracy of the order of 1 - 4% .",
    "for other types of potentials , for larger values of @xmath1 and quantum numbers @xmath408 , the quality is likely poorer , but we think that these duality relations are nevertheless able to give valuable informations concerning complicated systems which are not easy to be dealt with , analytically or numerically .",
    "in order to test the duality relations presented above , we can use the semirelativistic @xmath1-body harmonic oscillator studied in @xcite @xmath409 the afm solutions , for the general , the ultrarelativistic and the nonrelativistic cases respectively , are given by @xmath410 \\quad \\textrm{with } \\quad y_n=\\frac{4 m^2}{3}\\left ( \\frac{2 n^2}{(k+\\rho n)q^2 } \\right)^{2/3 } , \\\\",
    "\\label{tho2 } m^{(n)}_u&=&\\frac{3}{2}\\left [ 2 n ( k+\\rho n)q^2 \\right]^{1/3 } , \\\\ \\label{tho3 } e^{(n)}&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}(k+\\rho n)}q.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us mention that the last formula is an exact solution .",
    "the function @xmath411 is the root of a quartic polynomial whose explicit form is given in @xcite for instance . using these formulas ,",
    "it is easy to check the relations ( [ eq : dualpn1 ] ) , ( [ eq : dualpn4 ] ) , ( [ eq : dualmntmn ] ) , ( [ eq : dualun1 ] ) , ( [ eq : dualun2 ] ) , ( [ eq : dualmntmnu ] ) , ( [ eq : dualgennr ] ) , ( [ eq : dualnn1])-([eq : dualnn3 ] ) , ( [ eq : dualnn3b])-([eq : dualnn6 ] ) , ( [ eq : dualenten])-([eq : dualenten3 ] ) .",
    "the semirelativistic harmonic oscillator with one variable , studied in @xcite , has the following form @xmath412 the afm solutions , for the general and the ultrarelativistic cases respectively , are given by @xmath413 \\quad \\textrm{with } \\quad y_s=\\frac{m^2}{3}\\left ( \\frac{16 \\sigma}{a q^2 } \\right)^{2/3 } , \\\\",
