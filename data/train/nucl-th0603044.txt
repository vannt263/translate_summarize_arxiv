    "given that qcd is almost universally believed to be the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , one of the great challenges facing modern nuclear physics is to derive the properties of atomic nuclei from it . amongst the hopes for a more fundamental description of nuclear matter",
    "is to be able to extrapolate to extreme regions of density , asymmetry or even strangeness with rather more confidence than has hitherto been possible .",
    "one might also expect to understand the nuclear emc effect  @xcite and a number of other challenges to traditional nuclear theory  @xcite .",
    "while at the present time there has only been exploratory work aimed at relating qcd itself to nuclear structure  @xcite , there has been considerably more work within the framework of quark models and effective field theories utilizing the symmetries of qcd .",
    "here we shall concentrate on one particular model , the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite , which is built around the self - consistent response of the relativistic , confined valence quarks to the lorentz scalar mean field in nuclear matter . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have shown that the main features of the effective interactions used in nuclear physics can be quantitatively derived from the qmc model . in order to do this",
    "we rewrote the qmc model as an equivalent , effective hamiltonian with zero range many body interactions .",
    "the many body character of the interactions was a direct consequence of the response of the quark structure to the nuclear environment .",
    "we found that this hamiltonian was in quite good agreement with the popular skyrme - iii interaction  @xcite , which led us to conclude that quark level dynamics does play a key role in ordinary nuclear physics , even if it can be hidden within an effective many - body theory .    however , one unsatisfactory feature of the derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the approximations which were required meant that one could not justify the use of the resulting effective hamiltonian much beyond the density of ordinary nuclear matter ",
    "one of those approximations is actually tied to the physics of the model : the response of the quark structure to the nuclear medium leads to a non - linear meson field equation which is intractable in its full generality . in ref .",
    "@xcite we relied on an iterative solution of the field equations , which essentially amounted to an expansion in powers of the density .",
    "we showed that this is an acceptable approximation for ordinary nuclear densities , with the medium effects then appearing as many body forces .",
    "another approximation used in that work was a non - relativistic expansion which , in the framework of the iterative solution , appeared unavoidable .",
    "the latter approximation was also motivated by our wish to compare the effective hamiltonian with the skyrme interaction which is a non - relativistic object .",
    "these approximations , which were justified in the context of the earlier work , become untenable at higher densities .",
    "for instance , in this model one finds that the velocity of sound exceeds the velocity of light at about @xmath3 this is somewhat frustrating because it prevents us applying the model to the study of neutron stars .    in this work",
    "we propose a new formulation which does not rely on the approximations which we have just outlined . instead of solving the meson field equation iteratively , we expand the field around its nuclear expectation value and treat the deviation as a perturbation .",
    "this leads to an effective hamiltonian with a density dependent two - body force . as the equation for the expectation value",
    "can be solved exactly ( at least in a numerical sense ) , the bulk of the medium effects may be taken into account without any assumption about the value of the density .",
    "this is a major advance with respect to the formulation in ref .",
    "moreover , the case of uniform nuclear matter , which is the relevant approximation for neutron stars , can now be treated in a way consistent with relativity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : the - qmc - model ] we recall the basic elements of the qmc model .",
    "this is followed in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] by the formal derivation of the equivalent , density dependent nn force",
    ". a non - relativistic reduction of the full effective interaction is carried out in section [ sec : non - relativistic - expansion ] in order to make a detailed comparison with the density dependent skyrme force in section[sec : comparison - with - skm ] . in section [ sec : hartree - fock - calculations ]",
    "we carry out a full hartree - fock calculation with the non - relativistic , effective force that we derived and compare the results for selected finite nuclei against experimental data .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : high - density - uniform ] we solve the full model for uniform matter containing just nucleons  leaving for future work the generalization of the method to include hyperons .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] presents some concluding remarks and suggestions for further work .",
    "in the quark meson coupling model , the nuclear system is represented as a collection of confined clusters of three valence quarks .",
    "because it is possible to carry through much of the calculation analytically , the mit bag model was chosen to confine the quarks .",
    "it is assumed that the effect of having these bags overlap , that is clusters of more than three quarks , can be neglected .",
    "this approximation certainly breaks down at some density but we assume that it is still acceptable in the density range that we consider . in this respect ,",
    "we observe that the bag model is an effective realisation of confinement , which must not be taken too literally . indeed , qcd lattice simulations  @xcite strongly suggest that the true picture is closer to a y - shaped color string attached to the quarks . outside this relatively thin string one",
    "has the ordinary , non - perturbative qcd vacuum where the quarks from the other nucleons can pass without disturbing the structure .",
    "thus , while the bag model imposes a strict boundary condition which prevents the quarks from travelling through its boundary , this must be seen as the average representation of a more complex situation .",
    "one should not attribute a deep physical meaning to the boundary of the cavity nor to its size .",
    "in particular , estimating the density at which the non - overlap approximation breaks down as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 the bag volume , is certainly too pessimistic .",
    "the salient feature of the qmc model is that the interactions are generated by the exchange of mesons coupled locally to the quarks . in a literal interpretation of the bag model , where only quarks and gluons can live inside the cavity",
    ", this coupling would be unnatural .",
    "on the other hand , in terms of the more realistic picture presented by lattice qcd , the quarks are attached to a string but otherwise move in the non - perturbative qcd vacuum . there",
    "nothing prevents them from feeling the vacuum fluctuations which we describe by meson fields . as in our earlier work ,",
    "we limit our considerations to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "we recall that the @xmath8 meson here is not the chiral partner of the pion .",
    "it is a chiral invariant field which represents correlated two - pion exchange .",
    "the quarks of the bag are in the weinberg representation  @xcite , where the mass term @xmath9 is a chiral scalar which allows a chiral invariant coupling of the form @xmath10 .",
    "of course , this is not the end of the story because the transformation to the weinberg representation introduces an infinite set of derivative pion - quark couplings .",
    "these produce a complicated set of multi - pion exchanges , together with contact interactions .",
    "we assume , in the spirit of both quantum hadrodynamics  @xcite and the one boson exchange model , that the bulk of the corresponding physics can be modeled by the @xmath6 and @xmath7 exchanges between quarks .",
    "it is clear that the long ranged single pion exchange does not fit in this picture and must be treated separately .",
    "however , because of its pseudoscalar nature , this exchange does not contribute to the mean nuclear field .",
    "in the hartree fock approximation , which will be our framework in the following , it contributes through its exchange ( fock ) term .",
    "this effect has been estimated in the framework of infinite nuclear matter and found to be small .",
    "more exactly , most of the effect can be absorbed by a readjustment of the couplings to the other mesons .",
    "this is our first motivation for neglecting this part of the interaction but we must keep in mind that the argument is only true in the hartree fock approximation .",
    "when other nucleon correlations are taken into account , the game changes but this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our starting point is the _ classical _ energy of a system of non - overlapping bags of quarks , which are coupled to the nuclear meson fields @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we can write @xmath11 where the first term is the relativistic energy of nucleon @xmath12 , with momentum @xmath13 and effective mass @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the repulsion felt by each nucleon as a result of its vector interaction with the time component of the @xmath16 mean field , @xmath17 is the spin - orbit potential and the static meson energy is @xmath18-\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\vec{r}\\left[\\left(\\nabla\\omega\\right)^{2}+m_{\\omega}^{2}\\omega^{2}\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 the meson masses . as usual , we consider only the time component of the vector fields .",
    "the effect of the @xmath7 , which can be treated by analogy with the @xmath16 field , will be introduced at the end .",
    "the expression for the spin orbit interaction , @xmath17 , first derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not necessary at this stage .",
    "the effective mass , @xmath20 , is the rest frame energy of a quark bag in the @xmath8 field of the medium , evaluated at the center of the bag . in order to calculate @xmath20",
    "one needs to solve the bag equations for the relevant value of the @xmath8 field .",
    "however , we have checked that a quadratic expansion : @xmath21 is accurate up to values of @xmath22 as large as 600mev , which corresponds to densities far beyond the physical limitations of the model . the parameter @xmath23 is the scalar polarizability of the nucleon .",
    "it depends explicitly on the response of the quark structure to the external scalar field . in the bag model",
    "it is well represented as a function of the bag radius , @xmath24 , as @xmath25where both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are in fm .",
    "this does not give exactly the values that were used in ref .",
    "@xcite , because we have now included the contribution of the spin dependent , `` hyperfine '' color interaction to the bag energy .",
    "the coupling constant , @xmath26 , which by definition refers to the nucleon , is related to the @xmath8quark coupling , @xmath27 , by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the valence quark wavefunction for the free bag . for the vector couplings the relationship is @xmath30 equation ( [ eq:3 ] )",
    "holds for any flavor , @xmath31 , of hadrons , provided the couplings and scalar polarizability are replaced by their corresponding values @xmath32 . in the bag model",
    "they are related to @xmath26 and @xmath23 in a well defined way .",
    "thus the treatment of flavors other than the nucleon is straightforward and does not introduce new parameters .",
    "this matter will be developed in forthcoming work .",
    "here we limit our consideration to the case where the medium contains just clusters with the quantum numbers of protons and neutrons .",
    "by hypothesis , the meson fields are time independent .",
    "therefore the classical hamiltonian for the nuclear system is simply @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath13 are the position and momentum of nucleon @xmath12 and @xmath35 are the the solutions of the equations of motion corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) @xmath36 that is @xmath37 note that in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:8],[eq:9 ] ) we have neglected the contribution corresponding to the variation of the spin orbit interaction @xmath17 . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this results in an error of order @xmath38 in the hamiltonian and it is consistent to neglect it because the spin - orbit interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) has been derived as a first order perturbation  @xcite . since the equation for the @xmath16 field is linear ,",
    "its solution is elementary and poses no new problem with respect to our previous work .",

    "the hamiltoniam defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) is not a standard many - body problem , since we do not know @xmath41 and @xmath43 until the ground state nuclear wave function has been specified .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian must be determined ( through @xmath41 and @xmath43 ) at each step of the self consistent procedure .",
    "this is a significant technical complication . on the other hand , for our purposes",
    "it is not necessary to solve this hamiltonian in the general case .",
    "one of our main goals is to obtain the equation of state for very dense nuclear matter , with a view to applying it to neutron stars  @xcite , but in this case we only need the uniform matter approximation for which the model is easy to solve . of course , we do need to consider finite size effects for ordinary nuclei , a necessary step in order to show that the model is realistic with respect to nuclear phenomenology .",
    "however , in this case , we can make a non - relativistic expansion and build a density functional , @xmath63 , which can then be used in variational calculations of nuclei .",
    "we first consider the case of finite nuclei , in order to verify that the model is indeed realistic .",
    "for this purpose we build the density functional , @xmath63 , using approximations which are standard in low energy nuclear physics .",
    "the approximations that we use below involve a non - relativistic expansion and the neglect of those velocity dependent and finite range forces which involve more than 2 bodies  as is the case for conventional effective nuclear forces .",
    "this amounts to expanding the terms which involve either the momentum or the gradient of the density in powers of the @xmath8 nucleon coupling and stopping at order @xmath64 . to simplify the expressions we omit the spin and flavor indices as long as they are not truly necessary .",

    ", we have applied the present approach to a relativistic hartree - fock treatment of dense matter consisting of nucleons . in the case of symmetric matter",
    "we find an equation of state which is not very different from the one predicted by the skm@xmath0 force but in the case of neutron matter it is definitively stiffer .",
    "however to infer the implications for the neutron stars properties we need to investigate the changes induced when hyperons are allowed .",
    "finally , given that we are starting with a quark model for the nucleon itself , it will be extremely interesting find the point at which a phase transition to quark matter becomes favourable . in this work we have formulated the qmc model so that it can be used formally at any density but",
    "it is clear that it must break at some point . whether the central density in the massive neutron stars is high enough to reach",
    "this point is a tantalizing question .",

    "<S> a density dependent , effective nucleon - nucleon force of the skyrme type is derived from the quark - meson coupling model  a self - consistent , relativistic quark level description of nuclear matter . </S>",

    "<S> the similarity of the effective interaction to the widely used skm@xmath0 force encourages us to apply it to a wide range of nuclear problems , beginning with the binding energies and charge distributions of doubly magic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> finding acceptable results in this conventional arena , we apply the same effective interaction , within the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach , to the properties of nuclei far from stability . </S>",

    "<S> finally , we apply the relativistic formulation to the properties of dense nuclear matter in anticipation of future application to the properties of neutron stars . </S>"
