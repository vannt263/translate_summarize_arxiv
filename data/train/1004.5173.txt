    "at least three types of convection are known to ubiquitously exist at the solar surface : granules , mesogranules , and supergranules . their properties such as size , lifetimes ,",
    "shapes have been studied by many authors ( see reviews by , e.g. , leighton 1963 , spruit et al .",
    "1990 , nordlund et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) . through the magnetic field ,",
    "the convective energy is transported upward to supply the sufficient energy to maintain the 1 mk corona .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the convective motions plays a key role in the so - called coronal heating problem , one of the most important issues in the solar physics .",
    "however , the temporal evolution of convection motion have not been sufficiently elucidated .    the vertical motion in convection",
    "is easily observed by using doppler analysis .",
    "this motion generates compressible waves such as magnetohydrodynamic slow mode waves or fast mode waves .",
    "although a lot of energy can be transported upward by the waves caused by convection , compressible waves are not considered to contribute to coronal heating , because the wave energy will be significantly reduced before reaching the corona by shock dissipation or reflection in the chromosphere @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the horizontal motion in convection plays an important role in the coronal heating .",
    "the interaction between magnetic field and the convection generates alfvn waves @xcite while the stochastic photospheric motion braids the field lines to store the energy in the corona as electric current @xcite . due to the lack of observations",
    ", it has been poorly understood what mechanisms contribute to coronal heating .",
    "the local correlation tracking ( lct ) method commonly is used to derive the horizontal velocity field @xcite .",
    "since lct method uses apparent motion of granules to derive the velocity , it is better to use high spatial resolution and seeing - free data sets . from the horizontal velocity derived by lct method ,",
    "mesogranules and supergranules can be observed ( e.g. kitai et al . 1997 , ueno & kitai 1998 , shine et al . 2000 ) .",
    "although various studies reveal the frequency distribution @xcite and the spatial power spectra @xcite of horizontal velocity fields , few studies explicitly mention the temporal power spectra @xcite . in a previous study , we derived the photospheric horizontal velocity in 14 different quiet regions to justify the alfvn wave model for coronal heating @xcite . in this study",
    ", we will show the temporal evolution of the horizontal motion of the photosphere in more detail . when discerning between various coronal heating models ( see reviews by , e.g. , mandrini et al .",

    "_ hinode _ was launched on september 22 , 2006 in order to investigate the unsolved problems of solar physics , such as coronal heating .",
    "solar optical telescope ( sot ) @xcite , one of the three telescopes mounted on _ hinode _ , is an optical telescope whose spatial resolution is unprecedentedly high ( 02 - 03 , or 150 - 200 km ) for a solar telescope in space .",
    "as opposed to ground based observations that are affected by atmospheric seeing , seeing - free data sets over a long time span can be continuously obtained by sot .",
    "we selected 14 data sets of continuously observed quiet regions with the _ g_-band filter between october 31 , 2006 and december 29 , 2007 .",
    "our basic selection criteria was for the data set to have a duration longer than 70 minutes , with a mean time cadence less than 32 s. duration of the selected data sets ranges from 75 min to 345 min and the cadence is almost constant with the accuracy of 1 second .",
    "our data sets are selected to be located within @xmath4 100 arcsec from the disk center so that the line of sight is within 6 degrees from the local normal .",
    "pixel resolution of the ccd is 0054 ( 40 km ) and fov is larger than 27@xmath5 27(20,000 km @xmath5 20,000 km ) .",
    "we applied dark current subtraction and flat - fielding in the standard manner for all of the _ g_-band images .",
    "the solar rotation , tracking error , and satellite jitter causes overall displacements between two images . using cross correlation between two consecutive images ,",
    "we have derived the optimum shift to adjust the overall displacements in an accuracy of sub pixel scale .",
    "besides granular motion , @xmath6 mode waves generally disturb the intensity in the _ g_-band movies . in order to reduce the contribution from @xmath6 modes , we have applied so called sub - sonic filtering technique @xcite to our data set .",
    "the sub - sonic filtering technique removes the power where @xmath7 in fourier space . in the present study ,",
    "we have selected @xmath8 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the photospheric horizontal velocity of granular motion can be obtained by applying the lct technique to the _",
    "g_-band time series . in the lct techniques developed by @xcite , rectangular subfields or ",
    "tiles \" are used , and the displacement of tiles between two consecutive images determines the horizontal velocity .",
    "although the amplitude of the lct velocity usually depends on the size of the tracer , we have fixed the tile size to be 04 in the present study , the same resolution as in the study of @xcite . from the horizontal velocity fields , divergence ( @xmath9 ) and rotation ( @xmath10 ) can be derived , where @xmath11 are the coordinates in the photospheric plane and @xmath12 is the vertical coordinate .",
    "figure [ lctfield ] shows the _",
    "g_-band intensity image with horizontal velocity arrows ( left ) , divergence ( middle ) , and rotation ( right ) , averaged over @xmath13 s.",
    "we derived the apparent velocity in _ g_-band data from",
    "_ hinode_/sot by using the lct method .",
    "figure [ kwdiagram ] shows the so - called @xmath1-@xmath2 diagram of the horizontal velocity normalized by the maximum power .",
    "the time series of lct flow maps were fourier transformed to estimate the power spectra .",
    "the dotted line in the figure represents @xmath14 .",
    "since we use the subsonic filtering method , spectral power above the dotted line is significantly reduced .",
    "the region in the lower frequency and the smaller wave number has greater power . integrating @xmath1-@xmath2",
    "diagram over wave number space , we can estimate the frequency power spectrum density , @xmath15 .",
    "the power spectrum density is defined as , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the lct velocity , @xmath18 is the lowest frequency determined by total duration , and @xmath19 is the highest frequency coming from the observational sampling time .",
    "the symbol , @xmath20 , denotes the temporal average .",
    "figure [ tspectrum ] shows an example of the power spectrum density .",
    "power spectra can be fitted to double power - law function , @xmath21 when @xmath22 ( so - called break frequency ) and @xmath23 when @xmath24 .",
    "typically , @xmath25 and @xmath26 of lct velocity are 1.1 km s@xmath3 , 4.7 mhz , -0.6 , and -2.4 , respectively in this work . by using the same analysis , temporal power spectra of divergence and rotation of velocity fields",
    "are also estimated ( the dashed line and the dotted line in figure [ tspectrum ] ) .",
    "the total power , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 of the divergence is 8.4 @xmath5 10@xmath29 s@xmath3 , -0.2 , -1.5 respectively and the divergence will contribute to produce the acoustic mode waves .",
    "the total power , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 of the rotation is 6.8 @xmath5 10@xmath29 s@xmath3 , -0.2 , -1.3 respectively and the rotation is related to the generation of torsional alfvn waves .",
    "the power spectra of the lct velocity has a harder power law index than that of its derivatives ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the resulting power spectra are quite essential for evaluating models of coronal heating by alfvn waves @xcite . in their numerical simulations ,",
    "nonlinear alfvn waves are driven by photospheric convection to heat the corona . @xcite",
    "include the observed temporal power spectra shown here to generate alfvn waves and succeed in producing sufficient energy flux to heat the corona .",
    "next , in order to derive thecorrelation time \" of the stochastic convection motion , we derived the autocorrelation function ( acf ) , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is one of physical variables associated with turbulent motion and @xmath20 denotes temporal averaging process .",
    "the correlation time is determined as the e - folding time of the acf .",
    "correlation time often scales with coronal heating rate in various heating models that use stochastic convection motion @xcite .",
    "figure [ crtime ] shows the acf of the _ g_-band intensity fluctuation ( solid line ) , horizontal velocity ( dashed line ) , divergence ( dotted line ) , and rotation ( dash - dotted line ) . for _ g_-band intensity ,",
    "the correlation time is about 250 sec , which is comparable with the value in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the horizontal velocity has shorter correlation time ( @xmath0 100 sec ) than the _",
    "g_-band intensity fluctuation .",
    "@xcite also derived the acf of the horizontal velocity and found a relatively larger correlation time of about 35 - 45 min , because they were looking at larger spatial / temporal scale phenomena .",
    "acfs of rotation and divergence fall rapidly and their correlation times are about 50 sec .",
    "the correlation time in the coronal heating models is usually defined by the velocity correlation time ( e.g. sturrock & uchida 1981 ) .",
    "however , the lifetime of granules , which corresponds to the intensity correlation time , is usually used as the correlation time in the previous studies . since the velocity correlation time turned out to be shorter than the intensity correlation time , the coronal heating rate will be greatly reduced .",
    "let us explain why the correlation time of intensity fluctuation ( @xmath33 ) is longer than that of velocity ( @xmath34 ) qualitatively .",
    "the power spectrum of intensity ( @xmath35 ) can be regarded as the power spectrum of spatial scale . from the dimensional analysis ,",
    "the power spectrum of velocity ( @xmath36 ) is proportional to @xmath37 so that @xmath35 has a spectrum that is at most a power 2 softer than @xmath36 .",
    "since fourier transform of acf corresponds to power spectrum , softening of the power spectrum means hardening of the acf decay or long correlation time .",
    "therefore it is reasonable that @xmath38 is longer than @xmath39 . from the similar dimensional analysis , the shorter correlation time of divergence or rotation can be explained .",
    "if we integrate @xmath1-@xmath2 diagram over frequency space , the spatial power spectrum density can be estimated ( figure [ turb ] ) .",
    "the power law index for the high @xmath1 range ( @xmath40 ) becomes -5/3 , which represents the kolmogorov type turbulence .",
    "our results are complementary to the results of @xcite since they investigate large spatial structures .",
    "@xcite showed the same power law index in the power spectra of vertical photospheric velocity .",
    "these results indicate that the granules are kolmogorov turbulent eddies .",
    "we also analyze motion of test particles in the lct flow field . from the spatial deviation of test particles ( @xmath41 ) and the elapsed time",
    "( @xmath42 ) , diffusion coefficient ( @xmath43 ) can be derived , if we assume motion of each test particle can be approximated by random walk . for our data set , the diffusion coefficient @xmath44 is around 500 km@xmath45 s@xmath3 , which is comparable with that of @xcite .",
    "when we apply this value to the electric current cascading coronal heating model @xcite , heating rate that scales with the diffusion coefficient of the photospheric horizontal motion becomes less than half of the required rate .",
    "therefore when we consider coronal heating in the quiet sun , current cascading may not contribute significantly to the heating rate .",
    "since the lct method tracks the apparent motion of the photospheric convection , the velocity derived here would contain some artifacts from the apparent velocity even though we have carefully removed the effect of acoustic waves by subsonic filtering method .",
    "the decrease in density or increase in temperature causes the destruction of ch molecules , resulting in _ g_-band intensity changes @xcite .",
    "these intensity changes can affect the lct velocity .",
    "it is important to compare the result of lct measurements with the recent realistic 3d simulations @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "@xmath1-@xmath2 diagrams of lct velocity are derived for the first time to investigate the temporal evolution of the photospheric convection . integrating",
    "the power spectra over wave number space generally reveals a double power law spectral shape whose break frequency is about 4.7 mhz .",
    "the power law index in the low frequency range is -0.6 while the power law index in the high frequency range is -2.4 .",
    "the correlation time of _ g_-band intensity and horizontal velocity is about 200 sec and 100 sec respectively while that of divergence and rotation is 50 sec .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of photospheric convection is around 500 km@xmath45 s@xmath3 , which is not sufficient to heat the corona above quiet region through current cascading . by using the power spectra derived in the present study ,",
    "some of the coronal heating models will be justified ( e.g. matsumoto & shibata 2010 ) .",
