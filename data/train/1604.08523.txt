    "while numeric simulations have made substantial progress investigating specific configurations @xcite , quantum many - body problems in general become intractable beyond only a few dozen spins due to the exponential scaling of hilbert space dimension with system size @xcite .",
    "typically , such problems become even more computationally difficult as the dimensionality of the spin system is increased @xcite .    quantum simulation , in which the many - body problem of interest is encoded within a well - controlled experimental quantum system @xcite ,",
    "has proven an increasingly powerful technique for studying the behavior of interacting quantum spins .",
    "such quantum simulators should be easily reconfigurable and contain widely tunable parameters , so that they may investigate a broad variety of problems in disparate physical regimes @xcite .",

    "however , experiments have been restricted to one - dimensional ion chains emulating one - dimensional spin models .",
    "although effective 2d systems can be realized in a 1d chain by applying appropriate decoupling pulses and trotterized sequences @xcite , this approach scales very poorly due to the large number of required quantum gate operations . by instead constructing an ion trap quantum simulator with native 2d interactions",
    ", one can begin to address many of the open topics in quantum many - body physics that become important in two dimensions , such as geometric frustration @xcite , exotic phases of matter ( such as spin glasses @xcite and liquids @xcite ) , and the relationship between entanglement , frustration , and high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite",
    ".    it would be strongly desirable for such a 2d trapped - ion quantum simulator to retain the traditional 1d ion - trap strengths : full control at the single - particle level , site - resolved measurements and readout , and spin - spin coupling rates that are fast compared to the decoherence rate . however , current efforts to build 2d trapped - ion systems in penning traps @xcite and microfabricated arrays @xcite have yet to solve issues of individual ion addressing and slow coupling rates , respectively . here ,",
    "i propose the use of standard radio - frequency ( rf ) paul traps for use in 2d quantum simulation experiments .",
    "i will show that it is possible to choose appropriate trap parameters so that the ions driven motion  called micromotion  will have a negligible effect on the outcome of a quantum simulation , even for hundreds of trapped ions . with such parameters",

    "section v offers an outlook for future experiments and some concluding remarks .",
    "an rf paul trap may be operated in a regime such that the trapped ion coulomb crystal self - assembles in a 2d plane .",
    "we will investigate this regime here within linear paul traps with four segmented blades ( one of the most common trap designs @xcite ) , though the results are equally applicable for other trap geometries @xcite .",
    "for a typical `` blade''-style trap , the central segments of two opposing blades are driven with an rf voltage @xmath2 at frequency @xmath3 , while the other two central segments are held at rf ground .",
    "the outer electrode segments are biased with a dc voltage @xmath4 . near the center of the trap",
    ", the potential can be written as @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radial and axial trap dimensions and @xmath8 is a geometric factor of order unity . when cooled to millikelvin temperatures , ions trapped in this potential",
    "behave as though they were in a 3d harmonic pseudopotential , @xmath9 where the radial and axial trapping frequencies are given by : @xmath10 with @xmath11 the ion charge , @xmath12 the ion mass , and @xmath13 the mathieu  @xmath14 \" parameter .",
    "typically , a small asymmetry is introduced in the electrode structure to break the degeneracy of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 axes , thereby preventing a zero - frequency rotational mode and providing a unique minimum - energy configuration ; for the numeric simulations to follow , the trap frequency asymmetry between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions is set to be @xmath17 .",
    "if the radial trap frequencies @xmath18 are much stronger than the axial frequency @xmath19 ( the typical regime for most experiments ) , the ions will form a 1d chain along the central trap axis .",
    "as @xmath19 is increased ( while holding @xmath18 and the number of ions fixed ) , the linear chain passes through a series structural phase transitions into new configurations : zig - zag , helical , and ultimately a 2d triangular lattice in the radial plane @xcite .",
    "this final arrangement , which is desired for the 2d quantum simulation experiments proposed here , requires that @xmath19 be large compared with @xmath18 , with the ratio scaling weakly with the number of ions @xmath20 in the trap @xcite : @xmath21 hence , a 100-ion system requires an axial frequency @xmath22 times larger than the radial frequencies . from eq .",
    "[ eqn : trapfreqs ] , a large axial frequency can be achieved by increasing the voltages @xmath4 applied to the outer trap segments .",
    "however , if the dc voltage @xmath4 is too large compared with the rf voltage @xmath2 , this has a destabilizing effect on the crystal : the radial frequency ( eq . [ eqn : trapfreqs ] ) becomes imaginary , and ions no longer have bound trajectories .",
    "the ion trap voltages , frequencies , and sizes thus must be carefully chosen in order to achieve a stable and robust 2d planar crystal .",
    "the full stability regime for a 2d ion lattice in an rf trap , which depends on the axial and radial trap frequencies as well as the number of ions , will be calculated and shown in sec .",
    "iii(c ) .    for the numeric simulations presented in upcoming sections ,",
    "i choose the following set of trap parameters : @xmath23 and @xmath24 which result in radial and axial trap frequencies of @xmath25 khz and @xmath26 .",
    "these parameters lie squarely within the stability regime for a 2d crystal of @xmath27yb@xmath28 ions and are all straightforward to achieve in the laboratory .",
    "however , before implementing such a trap for quantum simulation experiments , we must first consider the effects of rf driven motion on the 2d ion crystal .",
    "for a 2d crystal in a linear paul trap , each ion is subject to rf - driven micromotion with an amplitude proportional to the ion s distance away from the central trap axis . for several types of ion - trap experiments ,",
    "even small amounts of micromotion can have significant harmful effects : it can lead to large systematic doppler shifts in ion - based atomic clocks @xcite , and it can substantially reduce the fidelities of quantum gates during a quantum computation ( in the absence of advanced micromotion - correcting protocols ) @xcite . nevertheless , many successful experiments do not depend sensitively on micromotion amplitude @xcite , and ion coulomb crystals of up to @xmath29 particles have been confined in rf paul traps @xcite .",
    "this section will demonstrate that for carefully chosen parameters ( such as those introduced above ) , micromotion effects on 2d quantum simulation experiments are both predictable and small .",
    "this result is enabled by the orientation of the 2d crystal : there is effectively no micromotion amplitude in the axial ( transverse ) direction , since the ions are compressed to a single plane at the axial trap center . by utilizing the axial modes of motion for quantum simulation protocols , one can thus sidestep the large effects of micromotion in the radial plane .",
    "nevertheless , 4 residual effects in the axial plane must still be considered : ( 1 ) a shift in the equilibrium ion positions , ( 2 ) the resolvability of ions due to radial micromotion amplitude , ( 3 ) shifts in the axial normal mode frequencies , and ( 4 ) an altered stability region for maintaining a 2d crystal .",
    "these effects are each explored in detail below .      in the absence of micromotion , finding the equilibrium positions for a 2d ion crystal proceeds similarly to the 1d case . in the radial plane ,",
    "the potential experienced by the ions has contributions from the trap voltages as well as the coulomb interaction : @xmath30 the equilibrium positions are the set of coordinates @xmath31 that minimize the energy .",
    "although direct numerical minimization is possible for small system sizes , finding the equilibrium configuration for larger numbers often requires the use of molecular dynamics simulations with added dissipation @xcite ; this is the approached used for calculations here .    in the presence of micromotion",
    ", there is no longer an `` equilibrium '' position ; the radial coordinates of each ion vary in time as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the ion s average position , and the higher order terms indicate the amplitude of the motion at the @xmath34 harmonic of the drive frequency @xmath3 . following @xcite ,",
    "each of these amplitudes @xmath35 for each ion can be extracted by self - consistently solving the equations of motion within the full trap potential of eq .",
    "[ eq : trappotential ] .",
    "the calculated central positions @xmath33 for a 20- and 100-ion crystal , using the parameters introduced in sec .",
    "ii and including micromotion , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : micromotion]a - b . the crystals",
    "self - organize into a 2d triangular lattice , with a 4.3 @xmath36 m average inter - ion spacing for the 100-particle case . when accounting for micromotion , the positions are found to shift by an average of only 0.08 @xmath36 m",
    " a very small change that would not be noticeable with standard imaging techniques and will not have any foreseeable consequences for 2d quantum simulations .",
    "the amplitude of the radial micromotion is also important to consider ; large amplitude excursions could obscure the individual ion positions , preventing quantum spin readout .",
    "the amplitudes of the micromotion - induced terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : mmposition ] may be written as @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite , where @xmath39 is the mathieu parameter . since @xmath40 for any stable rf trap , the first order amplitude dominates the time - dependent part of eq .",
    "[ eq : mmposition ] , and smaller @xmath14 parameters are advantageous for minimizing the micromotion amplitude . for the trap settings proposed in sec .",
    "ii , @xmath41 ; for the 100-ion case , this leads to a micromotion amplitude of 1.4 @xmath36 m for the most radially extended particle  still small compared to the 4.3 @xmath36 m inter - ion distance ( see fig . [",
    "fig : micromotion ] insets ) . since the radial extent of the 2d crystal scales as @xmath42 for @xmath20 particles with separation distance @xmath43 , the maximum micromotion amplitude scales as @xmath44 .",
    "if we demand that this amplitude be smaller than half the inter - ion distance ( @xmath45 ) , this constrains the maximum number of trapped ions to be @xmath46 , which is @xmath47 for the chosen trap parameters .      to calculate the normal mode frequencies of an ion crystal ,",
    "one typically expands the coulomb potential around the equilibrium positions to second order , then diagonalizes the resulting matrix to find the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of micromotion in the radial plane can have a notable effect on the axial mode frequencies and eigenfunctions ( even though there is no axial micromotion ) , and must be taken into account @xcite . as we will see , the primary effect of radial micromotion is to decrease the frequencies of all axial modes ( except for the center - of - mass ) , with the low - frequency modes experiencing the largest shift .        to second order , the axial potential experienced by the ions is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "due to the radial micromotion , the ion position differences @xmath50 are dynamic ( eq .",
    "[ eq : mmposition ] ) , which implies that the axial normal mode frequencies will also inherit a time dependence . however , since @xmath51 , it is sufficient to consider the expectation value of the potential @xmath52 over one period of micromotion , and diagonalize this resulting matrix to find the normal mode eigenfrequencies .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes](a ) , along with several representative mode eigenfunctions , for 100 trapped ions . here",
    ", the highest frequency axial ( transverse ) motion corresponds to the center - of - mass ( com ) mode ( just as in the 1d case ) and remains unchanged in the presence of micromotion .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : modes](b ) shows that all other mode frequencies are suppressed under micromotion ; for the lowest ( zig - zag ) mode , the reduction is more than 0.5 mhz @xmath53 .",
    "this change in mode structure will not impede 2d quantum simulations ; rather , its effect will be to increase the effective spin - spin interaction range between ions in the lattice ( as will be shown in sec .",
    "when quantum simulating spin models that are sensitive to the specific value of interaction range , one must thus take into account this micromotion - induced frequency shift .",
    "consider a 1d linear ion chain , which is characterized by a set of transverse normal mode frequencies .",
    "if the axial frequency @xmath19 is increased while holding all other parameters fixed , the ions will be pushed closer together , and all transverse mode frequencies ( except for the com ) will shift downwards .",
    "eventually , the chain will undergo a structural phase transition and `` buckle '' at the center ; this corresponds to the lowest transverse mode ( i.e. the zig - zag mode ) shifting downwards to zero frequency .",
    "red points show the calculated boundary in the absence of micromotion , in agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq : anisotropy ] ( red dashed line ) . when micromotion effects are included , the entire region below the blue points becomes unstable .",
    "this stability boundary is also found to exhibit weak power - law scaling with the number of ions ( blue dashed line ) . ]",
    "analogous effects occur for 2d planar ion crystals : when the radial confinement becomes too strong compared to the axial confinement , the zig - zag transverse mode crosses zero frequency , and the crystal buckles into 3d .",
    "this effect has been well - described in @xcite , which led to the scaling law in eq .",
    "[ eq : anisotropy ] .",
    "however , this earlier analysis did not explicitly consider rf traps , where micromotion can have significant impacts on crystal stability .    the previous section ( as well as fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] ) demonstrated that micromotion itself causes a downward shift in the transverse mode frequencies .",
    "this observation implies that micromotion can have a destabilizing effect : the zig - zag mode can be pushed to zero - frequency , even for crystals that are `` stable '' according to eq .",
    "[ eq : anisotropy ] .",
    "thus , one must carefully calculate the mode structure  including micromotion  before concluding that the ions will remain in the desired planar geometry .",

    "[ eq : anisotropy ] . as before ,",
    "the boundary scales weakly with the number of ions @xmath20 ; now , @xmath55 ( compared to @xmath56 previously ) .",
    "the primary effect of micromotion is thus a multiplicative increase in the ratio @xmath57 required for stability ; a _ very _ rough rule would be to calculate the needed frequency ratio via eq .",
    "@xmath58 , then add 45@xmath59 to account for effects of micromotion .",
