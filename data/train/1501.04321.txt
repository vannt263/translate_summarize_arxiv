    "age - structured models have been used in mathematical biology and mathematical demography for a long time .",
    "models of age - structured populations are either discrete ( resulting in leslie matrix models ) or continuous ( which produce the mckendrick - von foerster equation ) ; see @xcite .",
    "age - structured models have also been used in mathematical economics and environmental engineering @xcite .",
    "the study of continuous age - structured models has focused on two different research directions , namely , the study of the dynamics of age - structured models , and optimal control problems . optimal control problems for age - structured models have been used in @xcite and optimality conditions were derived in @xcite . the ergodicity problem has been studied in many works ( such as @xcite ) and many results have been presented for one or multiple continuous age - structured population models ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "since the mckendrick - von foerster equation ( which is also called the lotka - von foerster equation ) is a first - order hyperbolic partial differential equation ( pde ) , it is reasonable to expect recent results on controlling hyperbolic pdes ( such as @xcite ) to apply to age - structured models .",
    "however , much of this literature uses boundary controls . for chemostat models (",
    "where the dilution rate is the most commonly used control @xcite ) , it is natural to consider stabilization problems where the dilution rate is used to stabilize a specific age profile .",
    "the dilution rate control enters into the pde directly , not at the boundary .",
    "chemostats form the foundation of much current research in bioengineering , ecology , and population biology , and are important in biotechnological processes such as waste water treatment plants @xcite .",
    "stability properties for the dynamics of chemostats have been well studied ; see @xcite and the references therein .    in this paper , we study a simplified age - structured chemostat model without an equation for the substrate concentration , i.e. , we consider the substrate concentration to be constant .",
    "this is justified in the important case where the inlet concentration of the substrate is used to control the substrate concentration ( or the substrate concentration is slowly varying ) .",
    "two distinguishing features of the control problem we consider are ( a ) that the pde has a multiplicative ( instead of an additive ) input and ( b ) that the state is fed back to the inlet boundary ; see the system dynamics ( [ grindeq_16_])-([grindeq_17 _ ] ) below .",
    "moreover , we do not require that we know the age profile of the microorganism .",
    "only the value of a linear functional of the state profile ( i.e. , an output ) is known at certain times ( namely , the sampling times ) ; see ( [ grindeq_52 _ ] ) below .",
    "the controller determines the value of the dilution rate , and its key feature is the use of the natural logarithm of the output value .",
    "see ( [ grindeq_59 _ ] ) for our control formula .",
    "it is a sampled - data feedback for stabilizing an arbitrary positive valued age profile , i.e. , only sampled measurements are required , and the control is constant between sampling times .",
    "the feedback is valued in a pre - specified bounded interval , to incorporate input constraints .",
    "other key novel features of our work relative to the existing control literature for hyperbolic pdes are that we achieve global exponential stabilization for all positive valued initial age distributions , with arbitrarily sparse sampling , and that we do not require exact model knowledge .",
    "our key stability estimate is in terms of the sup norm of the logarithmic deviation of the state profile from the equilibrium age profile ; see ( [ grindeq_78 _ ] ) .",
    "the proof of our main result uses the strong ergodic theorem and the connection between hyperbolic pdes and integral delay equations ( ides ) from our prior work @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the first time that the ergodic theorem has been used to solve a control problem .",
    "our simulations show good performance of our control under three operating conditions , and so support our view that our work would be useful for industrial applications .",
