    "cassiopeia  a ( cas  a ; 3c 461 , g111.7 - 2.1 ) is the 2nd - youngest - known supernova remnant ( snr ) in the galaxy and lies at a distance of 3.4 kpc away @xcite . with",
    "the discovery of light echoes from the explosion , we now know that cas  a resulted from an asymmetric type iib explosion @xcite .",
    "one of the most exciting discoveries with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ was the neutron star in cas  a @xcite .",
    "the neutron star does not show x - ray or radio pulsations @xcite and lacks a synchrotron nebula @xcite typical of ordinary young pulsars still located within their supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "@xcite have shown that the neutron star is successfully fitted using a low magnetic field carbon atmosphere model and emits thermal radiation from the entire surface .",
    "furthermore , the cooling rate of the neutron star has been measured @xcite , it has a gravitational mass of m@xmath21.3 - 2 m@xmath3 @xcite , and the neutrons in the core have recently become superfluid @xcite .    the neutron star is offset from the well determined expansion center of the undecelerated optical ejecta by @xmath4 nearly due south @xcite .",
    "the implied projected velocity based on this offset is about 350 km s@xmath1 ( assuming an age of 330 years ) which is typical of young pulsars @xcite .",
    "however , the offset is @xmath5 from the axis defined by the northeast and southwest jets @xcite  the axis along which one might expect a `` birth kick '' due to supernova explosion asymmetries @xcite .    the jets , however , do not provide the only symmetry axis in cas  a. the x - ray iron emission and the infrared neon emission also fall into bipolar structures to the north and south / southeast @xcite . aligned with the north / south neon axis",
    "are gaps in the distribution of outer optical ejecta knots @xcite , further supporting a roughly north - south symmetry axis .",
    "these various bipolar symmetries observed in multiple wavebands in the north - south direction provide an alternative predicted kick direction for the neutron star  one that agrees with the inferred motion .",
    "although the offset of the neutron star from the expansion center of cas  a is effectively irrefutable evidence of the direction and magnitude of motion , a simple verification of the motion of the neutron star is in order",
    ". therefore , in this paper we report on the proper motion measurement of the neutron star using images from the high resolution camera ( hrc ) on the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. in  [ obs ] we describe the observations . in ",
    "[ register ] we discuss the image registration between epochs with the calculation of the neutron star motion presented in  [ motion ] . in  [ disc ] we discuss the results from our analysis and we offer concluding remarks in  [ conc ] .",

    "chandra_. care was taken to use the same pointing and roll parameters as the original 50-ks hrc observation in dec 1999 in order to mitigate any effects from the asymmetrical point spread function .",
    "as shown in table  [ obsparms ] , the 2009 observations were taken over four separate days and totaled about 3 ks less than the 1999 observation .",
    "the pointing centers for the observations varied by only a few arcseconds and the roll only changed by 0.1 . before merging the four level two event files from the 2009 observations , gaussian fitting of the neutron star was used to determine that the registration uncertainty was less than 0.1 pixel , where 1 hrc pixel=01318 .",
    "the 1999 data were re - processed using the same version of ciao and caldb as the 2009 data , including aspect correction .",
    "the original intent was to use five background sources within the field of view of the 1999 hrc image to register to the 2009 image .",
    "four of the five sources were present on the rosat image of cas  a , leading us to believe that they were robust sources to use .",
    "unfortunately , as figure  [ extrefs ] shows , only one of these background sources was present in the 2009 hrc image .",
    "we have named this lone background source src2 .",
    "therefore , we needed to use cas  a to register the 1999 and 2009 hrc images .",
    "the proper motions of the x - ray ejecta in cas  a are on the order of a few thousand kilometers per second @xcite .",
    "the x - ray proper motion measurements were made over a span of only two years and used the neutron star as the primary registration source .",
    "therefore , there may be asymmetries or measurement artifacts in the proper motions that could result in errors of order a few hundred kilometers per second , which is on the order of the inferred velocity of the neutron star .",
    "we then decided to use a number of quasi - stationary flocculi ( qsfs ) .",
    "qsfs are slow - moving ( @xmath6 500 km s@xmath1 ) stellar wind clumps with well - determined velocities based on over 30 years of optical observations @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that many of the optical qsfs had direct x - ray counterparts and that x - ray qsfs could be identified based on their spectra and dynamics .",
    "thirteen qsfs were chosen based on their brightness , isolation in the x - ray image , availability of optical and/or x - ray proper motion information , and position on the image  we wanted to have about equal numbers of qsfs above / below and left / right of the neutron star .",
    "these qsfs are identified in figure  [ regions ] .",
    "there are many statistical techniques for finding the `` center '' of an emission clump or determining the offset between two clumps .",
    "all of these techniques require the setting of some sort of bounding box over which the statistical calculations are performed .",
    "in addition , there are a range of binning and smoothing parameters that can be applied to the images before they are analyzed .",
    "to determine how much of an effect the bounding box , binning , and smoothing had on our analysis , we used the gaussian fitting routines imfit and jmfit within the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) with a range of these parameters .",
    "imfit and jmfit use 2-dimensional elliptical gaussians and are able to solve for a constant , linear , or quadratic two - dimensional baseline surface . images of each region at each epoch were made with a range of binning from none to a factor of 4 and with a range of gaussian smoothing sizes from no smoothing to smoothing over 21 .",
    "bounding boxes ranged in size from twice the size of the clump to hugging the clump tightly and a range of parameters were chosen to describe the baseline surface .",
    "the two aips gaussian fitting routines were very robust in reporting clump centers with the poorest standard deviation of about 0.5 hrc pixel ( 00659 ) for qsf4 and src2 .",
    "we repeated the analysis above using the centroiding feature within saoimage ds9 .",
    "centroiding was quite robust , with similar standard deviations to the gaussian fitting .",
    "however , in many cases the clump centers were significantly different from those determined based on gaussian fitting .",
    "this was to be expected because centroiding and gaussian fitting weight image data quite differently .",
    "our final two statistical measures computed the registration offsets between each epoch directly .",
    "for the first technique , the 1999 image of each region was shifted in @xmath7 and @xmath8 with respect to the 2009 image and the cash statistic @xcite was computed between the two images at each shift position .",
    "the amount of the shifting and the size of the box over which the cash statistic was computed varied from 20 - 80 hrc pixels ( 26 - 105 ) depending on the size of the region and nearby confusing emission structures .",
    "finally , the aips routine convl was used to determine the offset between images at each epoch using cross correlation .",
    "we again found that the solutions were highly dependent on the statistical method used with much less dependence on binning , smoothing , and bounding box .",
    "the single most complicating factor in these position and offset measurements is that the qsfs and src2 changed morphology between 1999 and 2009 , as shown in figure  [ regcomps ] . as a result , the different statistical measures varied not only in magnitude of offset between 1999 and 2009 , but in direction of offset as well with the largest difference being about 8 hrc pixels ( 11 ) .",
    "columns 5 - 12 of table  [ regdata ] show the results of the individual statistical techniques .",
    "the offsets reported for each region are averaged over all of the binning , smoothing , and bounding box parameters applied as discussed above and are reported in hrc pixels .",
    "the @xmath7- and @xmath8-offsets indicate how far the 1999 region is shifted from the 2009 region with negative numbers indicating offsets to the east or south .",
    "we also report in table  [ regdata ] the x - ray counts for each region as a measure of brightness . in principle",
    ", one would expect low brightness regions to have a larger uncertainty than high brightness regions . however , the morphology changes so dominated the offset measurements that there was no correlation between counts and measurement scatter .",

    "the motion of the neutron star in cas  a is typical of the birth velocities of young pulsars , which range from @xmath18 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "a number of physical mechanisms have been suggested to account for these velocities , including the disruption of binaries through mass loss in supernovae @xcite and the electromagnetic rocket effect @xcite .",
    "the most likely explanation , though , is a birth kick imparted to the pulsar through asymmetries in the supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "there is currently no consensus regarding the details of the core - collapse explosion process and the resulting asymmetries .",
    "some models favor magnetohydrodynamic instabilities to produce jets which drive a bipolar supernova explosion and impart birth kicks parallel to the jet axis @xcite .",
    "in other models , asymmetric neutrino emission , which is mediated by high magnetic fields , drives the birth kick @xcite .",
    "we now know that the neutron star has a low magnetic field @xcite with a motion that is roughly orthogonal to the jet axis .",
    "we know that cas  a s explosion was asymmetric @xcite and that there are a number of axisymmetric ejecta alignments also roughly orthogonal to the jet axis @xcite , including a gap in the outer ejecta knot distribution @xcite .",
    "careful mass estimates combined with modeling reveal that cas  a , as a whole , is moving at about 700 km s@xmath1 to the north @xcite .",
    "therefore , hydrodynamic kick mechanisms that do not invoke strong magnetic fields or misaligned jets and that only require a modest ejecta mass and velocity asymmetry are preferred , such as those of @xcite .",
    "we have attempted to directly measure the proper motion of the neutron star in cas  a over a baseline of 10 years using data from the hrc instrument on _",
    "chandra_. due to a paucity of background point sources , we were forced to use the qsfs in cas  a to register the 1999 image to the 2009 image . the qsfs are not point sources , are in motion , and changed morphology over the 10-year span .",
    "thus , our measurement of the neutron star motion is marginal at 390@xmath0400 km s@xmath1 in the southeast direction .",
    "this motion agrees with the inferred motion based on the offset of the neutron star from the expansion center of cas  a. supernova models that attempt to reproduce the kick velocity of the neutron star must also account for the direction of the kick , which is roughly orthogonal to the northeast - southwest jet axis in cas  a.    this work was supported by nasa through chandra grant go0 - 11089x and by the nasa - west virginia space grant consortium .",
