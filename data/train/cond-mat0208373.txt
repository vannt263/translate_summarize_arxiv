    "frustration effects in low - dimensional antiferromagnetic ( af ) quantum spin systems have attracted much attention because of their peculiar behavior in low - energy physics . the quantum effect and the geometrical frustration",
    "induce strong fluctuation cooperatively , which often gives rise to various non - magnetic ground states and quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "a typical example of such frustrated low - dimensional magnets is the @xmath7 antiferromagnetic zigzag chain ( see figure  [ fig : chain ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the zigzag spin chain is given by @xmath8 - g\\mu_{b}h\\sum_is^z_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the @xmath10=@xmath11 spin operator , @xmath12 is the land s @xmath12 factor and @xmath13 is the bohr magneton . @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the nearest neighbor and the next - nearest neighbor coupling constants respectively , and @xmath16 is the applied magnetic field .",
    "intensive theoretical studies have shown that the zigzag chain has a rich phase structure at the zero magnetic field . when @xmath17 , the system is equivalent to the heisenberg chain having the gapless excitation  @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath15 , a quantum phase transition from the critical spin liquid phase to the gapped dimer phase  @xcite occurs at @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "this gapped dimer phase is expected to extend up to the limit @xmath19  @xcite , which corresponds to the two decoupled heisenberg chains . here , it should be remarked that the dimer gap @xmath20 for @xmath21 is exponentially small : @xmath22  @xcite .     and the next - nearest neighbor coupling @xmath15 respectively.,width=283 ]    the theoretical studies mentioned above have stimulated experimental studies of the zigzag spin chain . in fact , the magnetic properties of @xmath23  @xcite and cu[2-(2-aminomethyl)pyridine ]  @xcite were investigated recently . for the latter case , the nearly gapless behavior of the magnetic susceptibility was observed for a powder sample , and then the ratio of the couplings of cu[2-(2-aminomethyl)pyridine ] is estimated as @xmath24  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on another type of the zigzag compound @xmath25  @xcite , which is interestingly expected to have the coupling constant @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath25 can be synthesized as a single crystal , we can precisely compare its magnetic properties with numerical calculations .",
    "an important point on the compound is that its magnetic property is very similar to the one in the single heisenberg chain limit , although it has the double chain structure .",
    "thus how we can distinguish the magnetic behavior of the zigzag chains between @xmath26 and @xmath21 is an important problem from both theoretical and experimental views .",
    "in what follows , we study the magnetic properties of a single crystal sample of @xmath25 , on the basis of the precise comparison between the numerical results obtained by the finite temperature density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite and the experimental measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and the high - field magnetization .",
    "in addition , we remark the effect of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) coupling(@xmath4 )  @xcite on @xmath25 ; we apply the mean - field theory combined with the finite temperature dmrg to verify the one dimensionality of @xmath25  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : exp ] , we describe the finite temperature dmrg method and the fundamental aspects of the single crystal of @xmath25 . in section  [ sec : dmrg ] , we show the dmrg results for the susceptibility and the magnetization curve , and discuss generic features of them . in section",
    "[ sec : result ] we show the experimental data of the magnetic susceptibility and the high - field magnetization parallel to the chain direction . then the exchange coupling @xmath27k and the ratio @xmath2 are obtained by the precise comparison of the experimental data with the dmrg results .",
    "we also discuss the 3d effect and estimate the coupling @xmath28 . in section  [ sec : dis ] the conclusion is summarized .",
    "for the reliable analysis of the experimental results , systematic numerical data of the magnetization curve and the susceptibility are required in a wide parameter region .",
    "however , the quantitative calculation for the zigzag chain at finite temperatures has not been made yet especially for the nearly two chain cases . in this study",
    "we employ the finite temperature dmrg method  @xcite , which is free from the negative sign problem and thus enables us to calculate the quantities sufficiently down to low temperatures with high accuracy .",
    "we note that the method is actually applied to some frustrated spin ladder systems successfully  @xcite . following the implementation procedure described in reference  @xcite",
    ", we calculate the magnetization and the susceptibility with the maximum number of the retained bases @xmath29 .",
    "the lowest temperature we can reach is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the larger one of the two exchange couplings @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we have confirmed that the computed data converge with respect to @xmath32 and the trotter number .",

    "@xmath25 samples were synthesized according to the method described in reference  @xcite .",
    "after several syntheses , we obtained small single crystal samples with a typical size of @xmath33 .",
    "chemical analysis shows good agreement between the observed and calculated ratios of the elements .",
    "this compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic system ( space group : @xmath34nma )  @xcite .",
    "the lattice constants at room temperature are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the chain structure of this compound is shown in figure  [ fig : crystal ] .",
    "this compound has the ladder structure in which cu and cl align alternately along the leg , forming a copper zigzag chain .",
    "copper 3d hole orbitals ( 3d@xmath38 ) are situated perpendicularly to the leg , resulting in small exchange interactions along the leg .",
    "magnetic susceptibilities were measured with a squid magnetometer ( quantum design s mpms - xl7 ) installed at kyokugen in osaka university .",
    "high - field magnetization measurements up to 30 t were carried out with a pulse magnet at the same place . besides , x - band esr ( varian e109 spectrometer ) and specific heat measurements were carried out at the same place .",
    "in this section , we present the dmrg results for the susceptibility and the magnetization curve , and then discuss the frustration dependence of such quantities for the nearly single chain and nearly decoupled chains cases .",

    "then @xmath49 starts to decrease , and finally converges to a finite value as @xmath52 .",
    "although the spin fluid - dimer transition occurs at @xmath18 , the expected dimer gap is exponentially small for @xmath53  @xcite , where the almost gapless behavior of @xmath49 appears  @xcite . as @xmath45",
    "is increased to 0.4 and 0.5 , the dimer - gapped phase starts to develop rapidly , and then the exponential decay of @xmath49 appears explicitly in the low temperature region .",
    "this rapid growth of the dimer gap also causes the considerable enhancement of @xmath49 in the high temperature side ( @xmath54 ) for @xmath550.4 and 0.5 .",
    "we next consider the nearly decoupled chains case  ( @xmath44 ) , where we can also see that @xmath49 basically shows the feature of the gapless chain .",
    "a remarkable point in contrast to the nearly single chain case is that the gapless - like behavior is observed in the wide range of @xmath46 ( see figure 3(b ) ) and thus the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath46 is relatively weak .",
    "this wide - range gapless - like behavior is attributed to the extremely small spin gap : @xmath56 , although the system is considered to be the dimer gapped phase for @xmath57 .",
    "for example , the spin gap is estimated as @xmath58 even at @xmath59  @xcite , and thus the effect of the gap is easily smeared out by the finite temperature effect .    here",
    ", we wish to point out an important feature of the susceptibility when analyzing the experimental results .",
    "if the frustration is small , it may be difficult to discriminate between the behavior of the nearly single chain and that of the nearly decoupled chain only from the susceptibility result , because @xmath49 of the nearly single chain and that of the nearly decoupled chain are very similar to each other .",
    "however , an important point is that the frustration dependence of @xmath43 for @xmath47 is relatively sensitive to @xmath45(see table 1 ) , implying that the energy scale of the dominant coupling constants has a certain difference between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , even if the shapes of the susceptibility are quite similar to each other .",
    "for example , the shape of @xmath49 for @xmath62 is almost coincident with that for @xmath63 , but the values of @xmath43 for @xmath62 and @xmath64 can read as 0.588 and 0.630 respectively , which show about 7% deviation .",
    "we now proceed to the results of the magnetization curves .",
    "figure 4 shows the magnetization curves both for @xmath47 and for @xmath44 at @xmath65(@xmath15)=0.125 , which can be directly compared with experimental results of ( n@xmath66h@xmath67)cucl@xmath68 measured at 2k as shown later . in the figure",
    ", we can basically see the characteristic property in the gapless heisenberg chain as well ; after the linear behavior with @xmath16 is observed near the zero magnetic field ( @xmath69 ) , the magnetization @xmath70 increases rapidly in the high field region , and finally saturates near @xmath71 .",
    "however , what we want to remark here is that the quantitative differences appear in the magnetization curve .",
    "for instance , in figure 4(a ) , we can see that the growth of the dimer gap for @xmath72 causes the enhancement of the magnetization in the middle - field region ( @xmath73 ) , which is consistent with the susceptibility result .",
    "moreover the magnetization curve around the saturation field @xmath74 is shifting to the high field side systematically as the frustration increases .    in order to capture the feature of the magnetization curves in each region of @xmath60 and @xmath44 , we here focus on the above",
    "mentioned systematic shift of the magnetization curve near the saturation field @xmath74 .",
    "for the zigzag chain , the behavior of the saturation field @xmath74 is easily obtained as @xmath75 for the nearly single chain , the saturation field @xmath74 stays at @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and it starts to increase gradually as @xmath45 increases beyond @xmath78 . on the other hand , for the nearly decoupled chain",
    ", @xmath74 starts to increase linearly as soon as the inter - chain coupling is introduced .",
    "this dependence of @xmath74 readily appears in the magnetization curve shown in figure  [ fig : mhd ] ; the magnetization curves near @xmath74 for @xmath79 remains at the `` vicinity '' of the pure heisenberg one .",
    "in contrast , for the nearly double chain , we can see that the curves near @xmath74 shift to the high field side linearly with respect to @xmath46 . as a result ,",
    "the magnetization curves near @xmath74 for @xmath47 become slightly steeper than those for @xmath44 .",
    "as was seen for the susceptibility result , the dominant coupling determined from the susceptibility exhibits a slightly different value depending on the nearly chain or nearly decoupled chains cases .",
    "then such difference of the dominant coupling affects the magnetization curve near the saturation field , which can be resolvable with the comparison between the accurate dmrg result and the experimental ones .",
    "therefore the coupling constant of the zigzag chain can be expected to be determined with the cooperative use of the susceptibility and the magnetization curve .     at @xmath80 and ( b ) for @xmath44 at @xmath81.,title=\"fig:\",width=294 ]   at @xmath80 and ( b ) for @xmath44 at @xmath81.,title=\"fig:\",width=294 ]",
    "we performed x - band esr measurements at room temperature on a single crystal sample of ( n@xmath66h@xmath67)cucl@xmath68 in order to get the @xmath12-values precisely .",
    "accurate comparison between the experimental data and the numerically calculated ones requires the precise @xmath12-values .",
    "figure 5 shows the angular dependence of the @xmath12-value .",
    "we obtained the @xmath12-values of 2.285 and 2.060 for the external magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the chain , respectively . in the following comparisons between experiments and calculations , we used these @xmath12-values .",
    "we carried out specific heat measurements on a powder sample of ( n@xmath66h@xmath67)cucl@xmath68 .",
    "figure  6 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat divided by temperature . here",
    ", the data include the lattice contribution .",
    "we observed an anomaly at 1.55k ( @xmath6 ) which is probably due to the antiferromagnetic long - range ordering . in order to avoid the 3d effect in this quasi - one - dimensional system ,",
    "high field magnetization experiments were done at 2k above @xmath6 .",
    "-value of @xmath25.,width=302 ]      .,width=302 ]    magnetic susceptibility @xmath82 of the single crystal of @xmath25 parallel to the chain , which was used for the esr measurement , is presented in figure  [ fig : sus ] , where the dmrg results @xmath83 are also shown for comparison . in the high temperature region",
    "the @xmath84 exhibits the curie - weiss - type @xmath85-dependence , and has a round peak around @xmath86 .",
    "when the temperature is decreased further , the @xmath84 also decreases and finally converges to a finite value in the zero temperature limit . since these features are characteristic in gapless 1d antiferromagnets , we should take account of the two possibilities of the gapless zigzag chains , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we thus analyze @xmath87 with the dmrg results both for the single chain limit ( @xmath60 ) and the weakly coupled heisenberg chain limit ( @xmath88 ) . in fitting",
    ", we first estimate the dominant exchange coupling constant from the position of the broad peak , by using @xmath12=2.285 obtained from the esr , and then tune another exchange coupling constant so as to reproduce the shape of the susceptibility well .    for the former case ( @xmath47 ) ,",
    "we find that @xmath89 of @xmath90 with @xmath9117.4k agrees well with @xmath87 in the whole temperature region ( see figure  [ fig : sus ] ( a ) ) . for the latter ( @xmath44 )",
    ", we can also see that the dmrg results for @xmath92 well reproduce the shape of the experimental susceptibility as in figure  [ fig : sus ] ( b ) , where the best fitted value is obtained as @xmath2 with @xmath93k . since the dmrg results seem to explain the whole shape of the susceptibility well for both cases , it is unfortunately difficult to confirm which case is realized in @xmath25 only from the susceptibility result , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "however , we note that the dominant coupling @xmath9417.4k for @xmath47 is about 6% bigger than @xmath93k for @xmath44 , which is consistent with the dmrg result . for the case of @xmath16 @xmath95 chain",
    ", very similar results were obtained using the same parameter values of the exchange couplings as for @xmath16 // chain and @xmath12=2.060 from esr .    before proceedings to the next subsection we make a comment about a possibility of the weak ferromagnetic coupling .",
    "we have also computed the case of a negative @xmath15(@xmath14 ) for @xmath47(@xmath44 ) .",
    "however , the shape of the susceptibility is changed drastically by introducing the ferromagnetic coupling , and so that the couplings of @xmath96 are antiferromagnetic .    .",
    "the open circles denote experimental data @xmath84 and the lines show finite temperature dmrg results @xmath97.,width=302 ]      figure  [ fig : mag ] shows the magnetization curve for the single crystal of @xmath25 along the chain at @xmath98k up to 30 t .",
    "the temperature was set a little above @xmath6 ( 1.55k ) as already mentioned . around the saturation field",
    ", there is a small hysteresis of magnetization between the ascending and descending processes , due to the magnetocaloric effect . in the figure",
    ", we can see that the measured curve of @xmath25 is qualitatively similar to the gapless chain , which is consistent with the susceptibility results",
    ". using the parameters estimated in the previous subsection , we now discuss the magnetization processes of the dmrg and the experiments .",
    "the temperature used in the numerical calculations was determined close to that in the experiments .",
    "the results of comparisons are also shown in figure  [ fig : mag ] , where the dmrg curves both for @xmath47 and for @xmath44 are in good agreement with the experimental one in the low - field region .",
    "however , the magnetization curve in the high field region is reproduced well by the coupling of @xmath2 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : mag](b ) .",
    "indeed the gradient of the calculated curve for @xmath47 is slightly bigger than the experimental one around @xmath99 t , while the curve for @xmath44 is well fitted in the all range of the magnetic field .",
    "the difference between two cases described in the previous section certainly appears in high - field region .",
    "hence we have determined that the zigzag chain compound @xmath25 is a weakly coupled double chain system with the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath27k .    .",
    "the comparison with the dmrg results ( a ) for @xmath62 and ( b ) for @xmath2.,width=302 ]      in this subsection , we would like to discuss the effect of the 3d interaction on @xmath25 . since the specific heat shows the 3d ordering at @xmath100k , some consideration for the 3d coupling may be required . to this end , we employ here the mean - field theory combined with the dmrg  @xcite .",
    "we use the obtained values of the couplings @xmath2 and @xmath27k , and assume a 3d heisenberg type interaction whose coupling constant is denoted as @xmath4 . according to the strong leg interaction @xmath15 , we assume the staggered magnetic field along the leg direction , and then determine the assumed magnetic field and the dmrg - calculated magnetic order self - consistently .",
    "in particular , the phase transition point within the mean field theory is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the staggered susceptibility and @xmath103 is the coordination number . calculating @xmath104 with the finite temperature dmrg",
    ", we can estimate @xmath4 from the experimentally determined nel temperature @xmath6 through the equation  ( [ eq : mf ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : chis ] , we plot the normalized staggered susceptibility @xmath105 obtained with the finite temperature dmrg . in the figure",
    ", we find that the crossing point of @xmath106 and the experimentally obtained nel temperature is given by @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where the @xmath109 is the normalized transition temperature .",
    "assuming @xmath103=4 , we obtain @xmath28(@xmath110k ) , which is about @xmath111 .",
    "thus we can conclude that the 3d interaction effect is much smaller than the intra - chain couplings .",
    "therefore the zigzag chain picture is valid for @xmath25 above the nel temperature .    .",
    "the dotted line denotes the normalized transition temperature @xmath112 for @xmath25 .",
    "the value of @xmath106 at @xmath113 gives the coupling @xmath114 following equation  ( [ eq : mf]).,width=302 ]",
    "we have investigated magnetic properties of @xmath25 , which can be regarded as a zigzag chain with the coupling @xmath44 by the accurate comparison between the numerical calculations and experiments .",
    "first , we have calculated the susceptibility and the magnetization curve of the zigzag chain using the finite temperature dmrg method for the nearly single chain case @xmath47 and for the nearly double chain case @xmath44 to clarify the differences between the two cases appearing in the parameter dependence of the physical quantities . from the experimental point of view , the quantitative difference appearing in the high - field region of the magnetization curve is found to help us to identify the magnetic nature of @xmath25 .",
    "we have next presented the experimental results for the single crystal of @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath12-values parallel and perpendicular to the chain are determined as @xmath115 and 2.060 , respectively by the esr experiment .",
    "the nel temperature is also estimated as @xmath100k from the specific heat of a powder sample . above the nel temperature , the observed susceptibility and the magnetization for the single crystal show gapless or nearly gapless behavior .",
    "an accurate comparison of the experimental data with the dmrg results shows that the dmrg results for @xmath2 with @xmath27k well reproduce the experimental results .",
    "the estimated couplings also show that the dimer gap of @xmath25 is @xmath116k  @xcite , which is much smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "hence the gapless behavior of @xmath25 observed above @xmath6 is consistent with the obtained exchange couplings .",
    "finally , we have discussed the effect of the 3d interaction , using the mean - field theory combined with the finite temperature dmrg .",
    "the estimated value of the 3d coupling @xmath4 ( @xmath117 ) is sufficiently small compared with the intra - chain couplings , which supports the zigzag chain picture of the compound .    in the present paper , we have addressed the zigzag compound of @xmath25 in terms of the bulk quantities : the magnetic susceptibility and the high - field magnetization , for which the rather precise analyses are required .",
    "however , the frustration effect often gives rise to the incommensurate behavior in the correlation function  @xcite , which is difficult to be captured by the bulk quantities .",
    "thus it is also an interesting problem to investigate the compound by measurements of the fluctuation - associated quantities with the position resolvable methods , such as nmr or the inelastic neutron scattering .",
