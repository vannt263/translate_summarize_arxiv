    "the immersion of degenerate gases in laser induced periodic potentials has led to numerous beautiful studies of both many - body and few - body phenomena , including squeezing , the superfluid - insulator phase transition , and collisionally induced collapses and revivals of the phase of a quantum field with few quanta ( atoms ) @xcite .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that with an average population of approximately a single atom per site or less , the removal of atom pairs from the lattice may be used to reestablish a robust atomic interference pattern even long times after dephasing has taken place due to collisional interaction among the atoms .",
    "this works , because the remaining zero and one - atom components of the quantum state have experienced no interaction , and hence no dephasing . in the same work we showed that if this removal occurs by formation of a bound molecular state , a molecular condensate may be produced and detected when the lattice is removed .",
    "the incommensurate rabi frequencies governing the dynamics among different population components present a major obstacle towards extending the results to the case with more particles in every lattice well , and the restriction to superposition states dominated by a vacuum component and a single atom and a single molecule component on every lattice site was crucial for the analysis in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we first motivate our work by a brief discussion of the recent experimental and theoretical work on formation of molecules in cold atomic gases .",
    "we then summarize the analysis of the connection between the quantum states of particles in indivual wells of a periodic potential , diffraction patterns , and the macroscopic population of a single condensate wave function . finally , we turn to the process of converting more than a single pair of atoms into molecules in every lattice site , and we present a method to do this with maximal possible coherence of the final state .",
    "we shall not make use of atomic interactions and of the mott - insulator phase transition dynamics , which can prepare an exact integer number of atoms per site and hence also an exact number of molecules @xcite .",
    "we assume instead that the lattice potential is applied to the condensate too fast for the mott insulator transition to happen , but slowly enough that the spatial motion of the individual atoms and molecules follow the lowest energy state of the potential .",
    "by carefully designed photoassociation @xcite , which makes use of the fact that the two - atom component is in a fully determined initial state , it is possible to convert atoms in a condensate effextively into molecules . by tuning a magnetic field across an atomic feshbach scattering resonance in @xmath0 , donley et al @xcite observed a significant production of energetic atoms , and a loss of atoms , which could be well accounted for by the production of a loosely bound molecular system @xcite . also thermal @xcite and condensed @xcite @xmath1 atoms",
    "have been converted into molecules by tuning of a magnetic field , and the fermionic atoms @xmath2 and @xmath3 have been converted into bosonic diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "the long lifetimes of molecular states formed by fermionic atoms @xcite suggest unique possibilities to study condensation of the molecular component and to convert the system back to the atomic system in the bcs superfluid state @xcite .",
    "all of these above mentioned experiments and theories deal with large quasi - homogeneous systems , for which mean field theories are well justified , and for which the atoms and molecules , ideally , populate only a single spatial quantum state .",
    "it has been proposed to study the molecular formation processes after the atoms have been subject to a periodic potential in form of an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "the clustering of the atoms in the potential wells increases significantly the two - atom density correlations of the system and hence the molecular formation rate .",
    "in addition , the quantization of the motion in the narrow wells , makes the photoassociation process a transition between well - reseolved discrete states with resulting better possibilities to control the coherence properties , and avoid rogue photoassociation @xcite . from an experimental point of view our molecules",
    "can be prepared in a deeper bound molecular state , selected coherently by the coupling laser fields . in @xcite",
    "it is proposed to invoke the mott - insulator dynamics and prepare a system with precisely two atoms per well , to turn these atoms into a single molecule , and to subsquently melt the molecular mott insulator and form a molecular condensate . in @xcite",
    ", we do not apply the mott dynamics , but we rather accept the fluctuating atom number in each well , and use the fluctuations as a seed to prepare mean molecular fields in every single well , which combine to a macroscopic condensate upon release of the atoms .",
    "cold atoms in lattices offer a number of interesting possibilities for many - body physics , quantum optics and quantum information studies , and we believe that the conversion to molecules will provide extra possibilities to study multi - component dynamics , and , e.g. , mixed bose - fermi systems , and for detection of low - temperature phase transition dynamics .",
    "apart from the restriction of the atomic spatial dynamics induced by the confining potential , the periodicity is the most characteristic feature of the optical lattice , and in this section we shall summarize some simple properties related to this periodicity .",
    "we assume that we have initially a quasi - homogeneous bose - einstein condensate at rest .",
    "this condensate may contain a definite number @xmath4 of atoms , which fragments with a probabilitity distribution @xmath5 for the occupancy @xmath6 of each of a large number of wells .",
    "the state of the system is described by a quantum mechanical many - body wave function , and the contents of each well is necessarily entangled with the contents of the other wells . if , instead the entire many body wavefunction is described as a coherent state , i.e. , an eigenstate of the atomic annihilation operators @xmath7 , in the absense of interaction among the atoms , this state factors _ exactly _ into a product state of coherent states populating each well .",
    "each site is in that case populated by a superposition @xmath8 of zero , one , or more atoms , where the amplitudes @xmath9 can be parametrized by a single coefficient @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "as long as the lattice potential is kept deep enough , the factorization of the total system into the contents of each well is maintained in the future evolution of the system , and hence we need only determine the state vector evolution for the combined atom - molecule system in each well , and finally obtain the macrocopic properties from the resulting product state .",
    "the macroscopic coherent state is a quantum mechanical superposition of states with a total atom number @xmath4 distributed according to a poisson distribution , and with a specific relative phase @xmath12 between different number state components .",
    "such a superposition state does not have a definite total number of atoms , but the number fluctuations are insignificant in comparison with the total number @xmath4 in the limit of large condensates , and one will not see any difference between predictions based on the coherent state and on a state with precisely @xmath4 atoms . remarkably , this argument also applies when the condensate is being split over many wells , where the relative fluctuations are _ not _ insignificant .",
    "the reason is that the poissonian fluctuations in atom number on each lattice site account properly for the entanglement of the content of the site with the remanining system , and the relative phase between number states assumed by the coherent state ansatz leads to correct predictions for the interference between different wells , even though this interference is due to entanglement rather than mean - fields @xcite .",
    "a more formal argument states that a poissonian mixture of number states is identical to a mixture of coherent states with random phase and the same mean population , and hence predictions for the outcome of any time evolution and subsquent measurement on states picked at random from either ensemble will be strictly identical @xcite , also when this evolution involves splitting the system in smaller components .",
    "we shall apply the coherent state ansatz throughout the paper .",
    "when the optical lattice is applied slowly to the zero momentum condensate , it evolves into the the zero momentum state of the lowest bloch band of the potential , which is , in case of a deep potential modulation , a real superposition of wannier states localized in each well , @xmath13 .    if the atoms occupy only the ground states of the wells of the lattice , it is convenient to introduce the discrete set of atomic field operators , @xmath14 , that remove atoms from the wannier mode functions rather than @xmath7 , which remove atoms from specific locations in space , @xmath15 the mode operators obey the standard commutator relations @xmath16= \\delta_{m , m'}$ ] .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the state with @xmath6 atoms populating the spatial wavefunction @xmath18 . in the state @xmath19 ,",
    "the mean value of the mode annihilation operator in the well equals @xmath20 , the mean number of atoms equals @xmath21 , and in the product state @xmath22 we have the inter - well coherence @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the condensate population is defined as the largest eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix @xmath25 , and in the basis of localized wannier states , the mean occupancy @xmath26 of the wells appears in the diagonal and the squared mean field amplitude @xmath27 appears in all other positions in this matrix . in a system with @xmath28 wells , the eigenvector with equal amplitude on each wannier function has the largest eigenvalue of @xmath29 , i.e. , in the limit of large @xmath28 the condensate fraction is @xmath30 , in agreement with the value predicted by the off - diagonal long - range order , @xmath31 .",
    "this analysis of condensate population and fraction also applies to the molecules if @xmath26 and @xmath32 are replaced by the molecular mean population @xmath33 and the molecular mean field @xmath34 . note that if the potential is removed slowly , the many fragments will combine together to form a single condensate with the population just identified .    in @xcite",
    ", we introduce @xmath35 , and we present a derivation of the momentum distribution of the particles after release from the periodic potential , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the fourier transfom of the wannier function @xmath38 . the sum over integers @xmath39 gives rise to a comb at lattice momenta @xmath40 with a modulation proportional to the square of the mean field amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "this comb sits on top of a flat background caused by the incoherent population @xmath41 of the wells , and the whole distribution is comprised within the width of the single well momentum distribution @xmath42 .",
    "using a lattice for the study of this system is not only convenient for the tayloring of the association process , or for the possibility to observe mott insulator dynamics : the multi - well fragmentation of the system leads to a diffraction pattern with a clear identification of the coherence properties and the condensate fraction of the system . by counting the released atoms or the molecules on a position sensitive detector the values of @xmath26 and @xmath32 and thus the condensate fraction of both atoms and molecules can be determined",
    "we now turn our attention to the formation of molecules .",
    "the above section provides the necessary connection to the macroscopic signals and condensate properties , and we shall hence treat the dynamics in a single well , only .",
    "let us first assess the theoretical maximum number of molecules and maximum mean molecular field , in the case where an atomic state @xmath8 is made subject to the association process .",
    "for even @xmath6 it is possible to remove the entire atomic component and create @xmath43 molecules , whereas for odd @xmath6 one may obtain @xmath44 molecules , and one is left with a single atom .",
    "we can write the maximum number of molecules for each atomic number state component as @xmath45 , and thus obtain the maximum expectation value of the number of molecules , @xmath46 for a coherent state with mean atomic population @xmath26 , we get @xmath47 and for a thermal state ( exponential distribution ) with mean atomic population @xmath26 , we get @xmath48    the mean molecular field amplitude is maximized if the atoms are maximally converted to the state @xmath49 and if the amplitudes on the molecular states are all real and positive ( @xmath50 ) , so that we obtain @xmath51 . we have not obtained a closed analytical form for this maximum , but for a coherent atomic input state we find that the square of the maximal mean molecular field approaches @xmath52 in the limit of large @xmath26 .",
    ".,width=226 ]    the above quoted results are theoretical maximum values .",
    "the purpose of this section is to investigate how close it is possible to arrive to these values in an experiment .",
    "we have solved numerically the time evolution of the simple photoassociation hamiltonian @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the operator of annihilation of an atom ( molecule ) at an arbitrary site .",
    "the site index is suppressed for convenience , since exactly the same process takes place at every site in the lattice .",
    "starting with a coherent atomic state , the hamiltonian ( [ hpa ] ) introduces in every lattice well a superposition state @xmath55 , from which the mean number of molecules and the mean molecular field is readily calculated .",
    "atom - atom interactions and interactions between the atoms and molecules are readily incorporated in these calculations , but they are set to zero in the present study , since our main focus is on processes which are fast on the time scale of interactions .",
    "1 shows the results of a calculation with a constant resonant coupling .",
    "the initial atomic state is a coherent state with @xmath56 atoms per well .",
    "the figure shows that , at first , atoms are effectively converted into molecules , but the conversion stops before the maximum possible value of 1.251 molecules per site is achieved , and the square of the mean field does not reach its maximum which we have computed to be 1.165 .",
    "the long time dynamics shows a pattern of collapses and revivals of large amplitude oscillations , linked with the different rabi frequencies between the different number components of the quantum state of the system .       during the chirp .",
    "the line with the largest slope correponds to the purely atomic component which is initially below and finally above resonance with the association process .",
    "the solid curves are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , and we observe that the purely atomic state is continuously transformed into the purely molecular state , which is the lowest energy state after the chirp .",
    "similar spectra exist for all values of the initial atomic population .",
    "due to the factors @xmath57 in the coupling of @xmath6 atoms and @xmath58 molecules to the state with @xmath59 atoms and @xmath60 molecules , the splitting at resonance differs for the different number state components.,width=226 ]    in order to increase the number of molecules , we propose to apply a frequency chirp to the photo association lasers across the resonance .",
    "if this chirp is slow enough , the system will follow adiabatically the eigenstates of the time dependent hamiltonian .",
    "if the lasers are initially detuned to a too low energy , the photon dressed state with @xmath6 atoms has lower energy than the state with @xmath59 atoms and one molecule etc . , whereas at the end of the chirp , these are the states with the highest energies , and the lowest energy state is the one with none or a single atom , and @xmath61 or @xmath62 molecules .",
    "the chirp applies to all atomic @xmath6-components at once , and if the chirp is slow , the system follows the lowest energy eigenstate throughout the process , and the atoms are all converted into states with the largest possible number of molecules .",
    "2 . shows the energy eigenstates during a chirp , where the coupling strength @xmath63 is turned on and off as a sech - function of time , and the detuning initially takes a value which is minus the maximum coupling rabi frequency @xmath64 , and which is scanned linearly in time to a final value equal to the maximum coupling rabi frequency .",
    "the plot shows the states with 4 atoms , 2 atoms and a molecule and 2 molecules , which are coupled by the lasers .",
    "similar spectra exist for all other initial number states for the atoms .",
    "an example of the results of this process is shown in fig .",
    "3 , where we observe that more molecules are produced than in the case of constant couplings shown in fig . 1 .",
    "time is given in units of the maximum value of the time - dependent coupling coefficient @xmath65 .",
    "the chirp may be carried out in different ways , and we do not claim to have identified the optimum .",
    "the figure shows that we produce close to the maximally expected number of molecules but it also shows , that the coherent component is very weak . as discussed in @xcite , the short range interaction between atoms causes a phase evolution of the @xmath9 amplitudes with a frequency @xmath66 , leading to a reduction of the atomic field amplitude @xmath32 since the terms @xmath67 acquire different complex phases .",
    "the resulting disappearance of atomic interference has been observed in experiments @xcite , and subsequent revivals when the phase differences reach multiples of @xmath68 have also been shown @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the loss of mean field is a consequence of the different complex phases attained by the the different state vector amplitudes as a result of the association process . the adiabatic process , following the lower solid curve in fig .",
    "2 . , implies that a phase factor proportional to the area between this curve and the horizontal line will appear on the molecular state .",
    "this area , end hence the phase , will be different for the adiabatic states obtained with other number state components .",
    "if the lattice is removed at the end of the process depicted in fig .",
    "3 . , the molecules will populate a number of different spatial states , and the zero momentum macroscopic state will only account for about 1/8 of the molecules .",
    "the phases are of course determined by our computation , but it is a non - trivial task to act on the system and individually control these values .",
    "we shall instead present a strategy , inspired by composite pulse and spin echo techniques applied in nuclear magnetic resonance studies @xcite , that accomplishes full phase control of the system .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "2 . , we note that the unknown phases are simply given by the areas between the horizontal line and the time dependent energy levels . observing that the time dependent energy spectra in the figure are symmetric with respect to inversion in the crossing of the dahsed diabatic lines",
    ", we can thus identify a means to cancel these phases : after one chirp , the purely atomic components have followed the states with the lowest energy to become components with zero or one atom and a maximum number of molecules .",
    "if one repeats the chirp , on the system , which now starts with molecules , i.e. , the upper state on the left , the system will now follow the _",
    "highest _ energy state and return to the purely atomic component , which is the highest state in the right part of the figure .",
    "the accumulated phase in the second chirp will exactly annihilate the one of the first chirp , and since this is true for all initial atomic number states , the combination of the two chirped intractions do not change the state of the system .",
    "now , let us instead perform the second chirp at half the rate of the first one . in this case",
    ", the phases accumulated on all components are twice the negative of the phases of the first chirp .",
    "the atoms have been recreated , but they have picked up phases so that the atomic system is actually not coherent any more , and if it is released at this point , its condensate fraction will be poor . we are not finished yet , however , and performing a third chirp on the system at the original chirp rate , we again turn as many atoms as possible into molecules , and the phases of the two rapid chirps and the single slow chirp will cancel to produce a real linear combination of molecular states .",
    "is as depicted in fig .",
    "3 . the second chirp with duration @xmath70 converts the molecules back into atoms , and the last chirp produces the molecules again , but",
    "now with a sizable mean field , as shown by the dashed line . , width=226 ]    we have simulated this process numerically , and fig .",
    "4 . shows the results of three - chirp photo association pulses applied to the atomic system with an initial mean population of three atoms per well .",
    "the figure shows that after the first chirp , we have many molecules , but a small molecular mean field .",
    "after the second chirp we have no molecules left , and after the third chirp , the molecules are restored and now with appropriate phases to ensure a strong molecular mean field .",
    "5 . shows the results of the same sequence but with faster chirps .",
    "both the total and the coherent molecular population are reduced compared to the slow chirps , and a more detailed calculation is necessary to find optimum chirp schemes , e.g. , as function of the total duration available for an experiment .",
    "in summary , we have presented a method to prepare a molecular system in a macroscopicically populated quantum state .",
    "the molecular condensate exists due to the simultaneous existence on every lattice site of different number state components , which are inherited from the number fluctuations in the atomic system .",
    "the system is too small to be treated by a mean field ansatz , and a separate derivation of the mean value of the field operator indeed shows that the phase is ill - defined .",
    "due to the deterministic character of the problem - there is no decoherence or loss at play - we were able to apply a controlled interaction , in which molecules were first created , then removed , and finally created again with a well - behaved mean field .",
    "this technique , and possible rapid versions which utilize composite pulse sequences , may be interesting to study in their own right for this system , and we believe that they may also be highly relevant in other studies with optical lattices with small occupation numbers on each site , e.g. , in connection with simulations of quantum magnetism and superfluidity .    _",
