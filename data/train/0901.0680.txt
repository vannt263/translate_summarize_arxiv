    "most gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) observed by the _ swift _ satellite show an early steep decay phase ( sdp ) in their x - ray light curve . it is usually a smooth spectral and temporal continuation of the grb prompt emission , strongly suggesting that it is the tail of the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "it is generally explained by high latitude emission ( hle ) , where at late times the observer still receives photons from increasingly larger angles relative to the line of sight , due to the longer path lenght caused by the curvature of the emitting region .",
    "these late photons have a smaller doppler factor , which results in a steep decay of the flux and in a simple relation between the temporal and spectral indices @xmath0 , where @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we test the consistency of hle with the sdp by modeling the prompt emission as a sum of its individual pulses , including their tails .",
    "we calculate the flux for a single emission episode in the framework of internal shocks , and then combine several pulses to model the prompt emission .",
    "we consider an ultra - relativistic ( @xmath2 ) thin ( of width @xmath3 ) spherical expanding shell emitting over a range of radii @xmath4 .",
    "the lorentz factor of the emitting shell is assumed to scales as a power - law with radius , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . in order to calculate the flux received at any time @xmath7 by the observer we intergrate over the equal arrival time surface ( eats ; @xcite ) , which is the locus of points from which photons that are emitted at a radius @xmath8 , angle @xmath9 from the line of sight and lab frame time @xmath10 reach the observer at the same observed time @xmath7 . for a shell ejected at an observer time @xmath11 , the first photon reaches the observer at a time @xmath12 with @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "we also define @xmath14 , which is the last time at which photons emitted from the line of sight reach the observer .",
    "we choose for the emission spectrum the phenomenological band function ( band et al . , 1993 ) spectrum , which generally provides a good fit to the prompt grb emission .",
    "the co - moving peak spectral luminosity is assumed to scale as a power - law with radius , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the peak frequency of the emitted @xmath17 spectrum . since internal shocks",
    "is the most popular model for the prompt emission , we consider it for the following . in this framework",
    ", several simplifying assumptions can be made : the outflow is expected to be in the coasting phase ( @xmath18 ) , and the electrons are expected to be in fast cooling regime . the emission mechanism is assumed to be synchrotron .",

    "we define @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "one should note that most of the results derived in the following hold only in the model of internal shocks , and not in a more general case .",
    "the observed flux is then ( in the framework of internal shocks ) : @xmath36   s\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_0}\\frac{t - t_{\\rm ej}}{t_0}\\right)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 .",
