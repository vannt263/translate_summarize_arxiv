    "instabilities driven by magnetic buoyancy have been studied over a number of years , with particular emphasis given to their role in disrupting a strong , predominantly toroidal magnetic field in the solar interior ( see , for example , the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a variety of ( essentially unrelated ) reasons",
    ", it has been suggested that the bulk of the sun s magnetic field is stored at the base of , or just below , the convection zone . from estimates of the rise times of magnetic flux tubes through the convection zone",
    ", @xcite argued that it would be difficult to confine the magnetic field for times comparable with the solar cycle period unless the dynamo operated only in the ` very lowest levels of the convective zone ' .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) proposed a similarly deep - seated layer of toroidal field , but from arguments based instead on the expulsion of magnetic fields by convective motions .",
    "perhaps the most compelling evidence for pinning down the location of the solar toroidal field comes from the discovery , by helioseismology , of the solar tachocline , a thin region of strong radial and latitudinal velocity shear , sandwiched between the convective and radiative zones @xcite .",
    "although there is little consensus on exactly how the solar dynamo operates , it is generally agreed that toroidal field is wound up from a relatively weak poloidal ingredient via strong differential rotation ( the @xmath0-effect of mean field dynamo theory ) .",
    "consequently , the tachocline becomes the natural location for a deep - seated , predominantly toroidal magnetic field .",
    "given this , it is natural to seek to build upon previous studies of magnetic buoyancy instabilities by incorporating the effects of a velocity shear . using the energy principle , @xcite , extending the results of @xcite , obtained necessary conditions for the ideal ( diffusionless ) linear instability of a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) state with aligned horizontal flow and magnetic field , each stratified arbitrarily in the vertical direction . from a different perspective , @xcite considered the fully nonlinear evolution of magnetic buoyancy instabilities in a magnetic layer generated through the stretching of an initially vertical magnetic field by a horizontal , depth - dependent shear flow .    instability due to magnetic buoyancy is an inherently compressible phenomenon , with the magnetic pressure playing the crucial role in reducing the local density of the gas .",
    "thus , most studies of the instability have employed the equations of fully compressible mhd .",
    "however , just as convection of a compressible fluid can , under certain circumstances , be treated within the almost - incompressible boussinesq approximation @xcite , so can magnetic buoyancy be incorporated into a similar magneto - boussinesq approximation ( spiegel and weiss 1982 ; hereinafter sw82 ) .",
    "such approximations afford a simplification of the governing equations and thus aid both theoretical and numerical analysis .",
    "our aim in this paper is to incorporate the effects of a velocity shear into the magneto - boussinesq equations , self - consistently and in such a way that the influence of the shear is comparable with that of the magnetic buoyancy instability .",
    "the equations of the boussinesq approximation for a compressible fluid were derived in the classic paper of @xcite , who considered thermal convection of a layer of fluid subject to two important assumptions : the first is that the depth of the fluid layer is much smaller than the scale height of any thermodynamic quantity ; the second is that motion - induced fluctuations in density , temperature and pressure do not exceed their static variation .",
    "the first assumption is a statement about the basic state , the second is an eminently reasonable supposition that can be verified _ a posteriori_. under these assumptions ,",
    "the governing equations simplify considerably .",
    "in particular , the fluid is treated as incompressible , with density variations neglected except in the buoyancy term in the equation of motion ; furthermore , fluctuations in the pressure are small  a reflection of the low mach number  and thus density variations are directly proportional to variations in temperature .    for problems such as magnetoconvection , magnetic fields can be incorporated into the boussinesq approximation in a straightforward manner ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the field enters through the induction equation and via the lorentz force in the momentum equation ; variations in magnetic pressure are assumed to have no influence on density fluctuations . including the effects of magnetic buoyancy is however a more subtle procedure . sw82",
    "considered the problem of the instability of a stratified , horizontal magnetic field with scale height @xmath1 very large compared with the layer depth @xmath2 .",
    "the crucial ordering is now one in which variations in the _ total _ pressure ( gas @xmath3 magnetic ) are small ; this has implications for all the governing equations . in the momentum equation ,",
    "density fluctuations are related to variations in both the temperature and the magnetic pressure ; similarly , variations in magnetic pressure enter into the energy equation .",
    "the velocity is , to leading order , incompressible .",
    "however , it becomes necessary to include the next order correction to @xmath4 in the induction equation ; in standard notation this then takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the density scale height of the basic state .",
    "the final , and extremely important feature to note is that within the magneto - boussinesq approximation , magnetic buoyancy is relevant only for modes of a certain horizontal scale . in particular ,",
    "when considering the stability of an equilibrium state with a unidirectional horizontal field , magnetic buoyancy is of significance for perturbations with a long ( @xmath7 ) length scale in the direction of the imposed field .",
    "one consequence of this is that the magnetic field is not exactly solenoidal ; @xmath8 only to @xmath9 , an approximation that is however consistent with the overall level of approximation introduced in the magneto - boussinesq approximation .    in an approach complementary to that of sw82 , corfield ( 1984 ) ( hereinafter c84 ) re - derived the magneto - boussinesq equations through a formal scaling analysis , expanding all variables in terms of the two small parameters of the system : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes any of the scale heights ( all comparable ) , and @xmath12 , the ratio of fluctuations in density to a representative value .",
    "our aim in this paper is to incorporate the effects of a shear flow into the magneto - boussinesq approximation .",
    "as explained in appendix  [ ap : noshear ] , if this is done in what might be considered the obvious fashion  namely with the shear flow of the same order as the velocity perturbations in corfield s ordering  then the influence of the shear has no bearing on the onset of instability .",
    "thus , in order to consider a regime in which a shear flow may interact with the magnetic buoyancy instability , it becomes necessary to consider in some detail the magnitudes of the imposed magnetic field and the velocity shear flow , together with their gradients , as well as the horizontal scale of the perturbations .",
    "in section  [ sec2 ] we present a derivation of the scalings inherent to the magneto - boussinesq approximation in the absence of an imposed shear flow ; the derivation is along similar lines to that of @xcite , though we are more explicit in stating the underlying physical assumptions . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we explore the orderings of the imposed shear flow and magnetic field that are necessary in order to accommodate the effects of magnetic buoyancy and velocity shear on the same footing . following this",
    ", section  [ sec4_1 ] contains the main result of the paper , the derivation of asymptotically consistent magneto - boussinesq equations incorporating velocity shear ; the crucial differences with the equations of c84 are discussed in section  [ sec4_2 ] . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we explore these differences systematically by explaining how the various scalings change with the magnitude of the magnetic field scale height , thus providing a transition between the equations of @xcite and our new set of equations . the concluding discussion",
    "is contained in section  [ sec6 ] .",
    "in standard notation , the magnetohydrodynamic equations for a perfect gas are    [ eq : mhd ] @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the unit vector in the vertical direction , @xmath15 is the total pressure , consisting of the sum of the gas pressure @xmath16 and the magnetic pressure @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a body force and @xmath19 the specific heat at constant pressure @xmath20 , the permeability @xmath21 , the magnetic diffusivity @xmath22 , the thermal conductivity @xmath23 , the gas constant @xmath24 and the dynamic viscosity @xmath25 are all taken as constant . although we shall assume a perfect gas throughout , the main ideas of the paper still hold for a more general equation of state .    an important point to make",
    "is that our analysis proceeds via three distinct stages .",
    "first we consider a purely hydrostatic , @xmath26-dependent _ reference state_. this is then perturbed by the inclusion of a horizontal magnetic field and aligned shear flow , both @xmath26-dependent , leading to a @xmath26-dependent mhd _",
    "basic state_. finally , we consider three - dimensional , time - dependent perturbations of this basic state .    the reference state ,",
    "consisting of a vertically stratified layer of gas in hydrostatic balance in the region @xmath27 , is governed by the equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the reference state pressure and density respectively . for any field variable @xmath31",
    "we define the inverse scale height of a reference state @xmath32 by @xmath33 and take @xmath34 to be a characteristic value of the variable .",
    "the physical idea of the boussinesq approximation is that the depth of the layer @xmath2 is considered small in comparison with the pressure scale height , @xmath35 , where the isothermal sound speed @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37 ; note , from the equation of state  , that the density and temperature scale heights have the same magnitude as @xmath38 and so it follows that @xmath39 .",
    "the reference state is modified by the introduction of a steady , horizontal magnetic field and an aligned steady shear flow .",
    "the field takes the form @xmath40 , where , for non - zero magnetic diffusivity , @xmath41 is a linear function of height @xmath26 ; the flow @xmath42 results from the ( arbitrary ) body force @xmath43 . these , in turn , introduce a perturbation of the reference state to form a _",
    "basic state_. analogous to the hats denoting reference state quantities , we shall use a subscript zero to denote the perturbations away from the reference state that result from the imposed magnetic field and shear flow .",
    "we define the scale heights @xmath1 and @xmath44 in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ; at this stage we stipulate only that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as the representative value for the magnetic field",
    ", we may take @xmath49 to be the rms value of @xmath41 over the layer .",
    "for the velocity field , the physics is of course unchanged by the addition of a constant flow to @xmath50 ; thus we define @xmath51 as the rms value of a shear flow in a frame of reference chosen such that the flow has zero mean .",
    "we make the assumption , as in @xcite , that the alfvn speed @xmath52 is small in comparison with the sound speed @xmath36 ; this guarantees that the difference between the reference and basic states is small . on subtracting off the reference state ,",
    "the ` @xmath53 ' variables satisfy the equations    @xmath54    we now consider time - dependent , typically three - dimensional perturbations to the basic state .",
    "on denoting this perturbation of a field variable @xmath31 by @xmath55 , we may write @xmath56 thus expressing @xmath31 in the terms of its reference state ( hat ) , the steady perturbation arising from the imposed field and flow ( subscript zero ) , leading to a basic state , and time - dependent perturbations away from the basic state ( denoted by @xmath57 ) .    on defining @xmath58 as the change in @xmath59 across the layer",
    ", we make the assumption ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the size of the time - dependent perturbations does not exceed that of the jump across the layer , i.e.  @xmath60 . furthermore , for vector fields @xmath61",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the notation @xmath62 and @xmath63 , representing the magnitudes of the components of the fluctuations parallel and perpendicular to the basic state magnetic field .",
    "we proceed in a similar fashion to @xcite by finding appropriate magnitudes for the perturbations in terms of the basic state . with our focus on buoyancy - driven instabilities , an appropriate ordering",
    "is that the kinetic energy of the transverse flow results from buoyancy perturbations , i.e. @xmath64 in the hydrodynamic boussinesq approximation @xcite , fluctuations in gas pressure are small , the predominant balance in the equation of state being between temperature and density fluctuations .",
    "the idea underlying magnetic buoyancy is that it is fluctuations in _ total _ pressure that are considered small , with fluctuations in gas pressure therefore being comparable with those of magnetic pressure ; thus gas pressure variations are retained in the perturbed equation of state . with this in mind",
    ", we adopt the same scaling for total pressure fluctuations as @xcite , namely @xmath65 from which it follows that @xmath66 thus the density perturbation may be expressed in terms of temperature and magnetic pressure perturbations as @xmath67 on the assumption that the magnitude of the magnetic field fluctuations does not exceed that of the imposed field , the magnetic pressure perturbation may thus be written as @xmath68 balancing the two terms of the parallel component of @xmath69 provides the following crucial ordering : @xmath70 hence , using   and , we obtain a relation between the magnitude of the density perturbations and that of the basic state magnetic field , @xmath71 combining the orderings ( [ eq : strb ] ) and ( [ eq : energy ] ) then provides the consistent scaling of the magnitude of the perpendicular velocity in terms of the basic state magnetic field , @xmath72 as shown by @xcite and @xcite , a significant difference between the standard boussinesq equations and the magneto - boussinesq equations is that the latter necessarily impose a restriction on the perturbation lengthscale @xmath73 in the direction of the imposed magnetic field .",
    "we now address this issue within our derivation ; the arguments advanced to date are valid irrespective of the value of @xmath73 .",
    "we expect advection and stretching of the magnetic field to be of comparable importance ; from the perpendicular and parallel components of the induction equation this gives the scalings @xmath74 leading , after the use of ( [ eq : mscale ] ) , to @xmath75    finally , we use the fact that it is physically important to include the effects of magnetic tension .",
    "balancing inertia against magnetic tension in the momentum equation leads to the ordering @xmath76 and hence , using , to @xmath77 in deriving we have used the perpendicular component of the momentum equation directly ; balancing the terms in the parallel component and using the expressions   and for @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively leads to the same result . finally ,",
    "combining the scalings   and provides an important constraint on the horizontal lengthscale , namely @xmath80    the above scalings have been derived solely by consideration of the basic ideas of magnetic buoyancy , without any reference as yet to the shear flow @xmath50 .",
    "their derivation follows a rather different line of argument to that of @xcite , in the process demonstrating their validity for magnetic field scale heights in the entire range @xmath47 . in the case of @xmath81 , they are entirely consistent with those of @xcite . as we shall see , for our future exposition involving the introduction of velocity shear , it is important that we make no _ a priori _ assumption about the magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "on demanding that velocity shear enters the momentum equation in a significant manner , a balance between inertia and magnetic tension gives @xmath82 similarly , from the induction equation , a balance between advection and stretching of magnetic field leads to @xmath83 equating these two expressions for @xmath84 , and making use of the orderings and for the relative sizes of the magnetic field perturbations , yields the important result , @xmath85    in appendix  [ ap : noshear ] , we consider the linear stability analysis of the basic state formed by the imposition of a shear flow into the magneto - boussinesq equations of @xcite , i.e.  with @xmath86 ; the flow is assumed to have scale height @xmath87 and a characteristic velocity comparable in magnitude with that of the velocity fluctuations . as such , @xmath88 is neglected in favour of @xmath89 in the advective terms , although the shear ( through @xmath90 ) does appear in both the momentum and induction equations ( and ) .",
    "however , somewhat surprisingly , it plays no role in the resulting eigenvalue problem .",
    "similarly , on adopting the scaling @xmath91 , a galilean transformation can be made such that the system in appendix  [ ap : noshear ] is again recovered .",
    "thus the nave introduction of a shear flow into the magneto - boussinesq equations does not describe a regime in which the flow can influence the onset of magnetic buoyancy instabilities .    in order to involve the velocity shear in a meaningful manner , it is imperative therefore that two conditions are met .",
    "the first is that @xmath92 the second is that the imposed flow is significant in the advective terms ; this requires that @xmath88 and @xmath89 be of comparable magnitude , thus forcing a balance between the basic state velocity and the perpendicular velocity perturbation , @xmath93 henceforth , we shall refer to a shear flow that satisfies both and as being _",
    "influential_. combining the two expressions for @xmath84 , and , provides the following important ordering for the magnitude of the shear flow in terms of the alfvn velocity of the imposed magnetic field , @xmath94    whereas the scalings of section  [ sec2 ] are valid for magnetic field scale heights satisfying @xmath47 , the requirement that the imposed shear flow influences the magnetic buoyancy instability places a tighter restriction on @xmath1 .",
    "scalings  , and lead to the crucial result that @xmath95",
    "sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] provide the framework required to introduce velocity shear into the magneto - boussinesq approximation . we shall now incorporate these ideas into the derivation of an asymptotically consistent set of governing equations .",
    "we focus on an influential shear flow , with @xmath96 , and define two small parameters , @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "physically , @xmath99 is a measure of the inverse pressure scale height of the hydrostatic reference state , whereas @xmath100 , through , provides a measure of the amplitude of the fluctuations driven by magnetic buoyancy .",
    "( we note that our @xmath100 is of the same order of magnitude as the @xmath100 of @xcite , defined as @xmath101 . )",
    "it follows from that @xmath102 using expression  , we may rewrite the horizontal lengthscale in terms of @xmath99 , @xmath103    we non - dimensionalise @xmath104 by @xmath105 , @xmath16 by @xmath106 , @xmath107 by @xmath108 , @xmath109 by @xmath106 , lengths with @xmath2 and times with the sound crossing time across the layer . the condition that motion - induced fluctuations do not exceed , in order of magnitude , static variations across the layer translates to the requirement that @xmath110 . following @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we express all variables in terms of the two small parameters , with non - dimensional variables of order unity denoted by a tilde .",
    "based on the scalings derived in section  [ sec2 ] , the thermodynamic quantities are expressed as    [ eq : expan ] @xmath111 where we have linearised the reference state . the magnetic and total pressure",
    "are expanded as @xmath112 where expression   has been used for the ordering of the @xmath113 term .",
    "it is convenient to split the velocity and magnetic field into their parallel and perpendicular components ; from expressions  , and these become @xmath114 based on , we write @xmath115 the time scale is determined by the conventional boussinesq approach of balancing the vertical acceleration against the buoyancy .",
    "using the scalings for @xmath116 and @xmath84 , this gives @xmath117    the various expansions   are then substituted into the mhd equations  . to simplify the notation , we drop the tildes , write @xmath118 and drop the @xmath57 from the other terms .",
    "after substituting for @xmath119 and @xmath116 from equations   and , and removing terms that arise from the basic state , the governing equations at leading order become :    [ eq : new ] @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124    where the vertical components of the velocity and magnetic field perturbations are denoted by @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that from the scaling  , @xmath109 in equations   is given by @xmath127 ; the perturbation to the total pressure is @xmath128 .",
    "the operator @xmath129 is defined as @xmath130 the various non - dimensional numbers are defined as follows : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the conventional ratio of specific heats ; @xmath133 is the prandtl number , @xmath134 is the magnetic prandtl number and @xmath135 is the rayleigh number ( note that our @xmath136 is equivalent to @xmath137 in @xcite ) . ensuring that the diffusion terms do not dominate imposes the restriction that @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are all @xmath141 . for asymptotic consistency ,",
    "the subadiabatic temperature gradient in equation   must be @xmath142 , and so we have defined @xmath143    equations   are derived only under the assumption that @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath99 and @xmath100 are comparable then the subadiabatic gradient is @xmath144 , comparable in magnitude with its component gradients of pressure and density .",
    "however , if @xmath145 then the subadiabatic gradient , being @xmath142 , is formally smaller than the pressure and density gradients , and therefore in this case , equations   hold only for atmospheres that are close to adiabatic",
    ". finally we note that equations   may be expressed in an alternative form through the introduction of the variable @xmath146 ; this leads to a certain simplification , through the combination of terms , though the dissipation of the basic state velocity @xmath147 must then be accounted for in equations   and .",
    "there are significant differences between our new system of equations   and the equations derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in order to maintain consistent scalings following the introduction of an influential shear flow , the magnetic field scale height @xmath1 has to be @xmath148 , considerably smaller than that adopted in @xcite , namely @xmath81 . through the scalings derived in sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] ,",
    "this leads to important differences in the magnitudes of both perturbation and basic state quantities .",
    "the @xcite ordering of @xmath81 forces @xmath149 through expression  ; in turn , from , this implies that for both the flow and field perturbations , the perpendicular and parallel components have the same magnitude .",
    "this is in marked contrast to our system , in which although the perpendicular components of the flow and field scale as in @xcite , namely @xmath150 the parallel components are @xmath151 greater .",
    "furthermore , from , the characteristic strength of the basic state magnetic field @xmath49 is given by @xmath152 thus highlighting a further important difference between the two systems : for our equations , governed by the scaling @xmath153 , expression becomes @xmath154 whereas for @xcite the characteristic field strength @xmath49 is @xmath155 greater .",
    "hence the condition that an imposed shear flow be influential requires an @xmath156 reduction in the strength of the basic state magnetic field .",
    "unlike the equations of @xcite , equations   now satisfy , at leading order , both the full incompressibility condition   and the full solenoidal condition on the magnetic field  .",
    "consequently , since the new system is fully incompressible , there is no longer a next - order correction of @xmath157 to the induction equation and hence the induction equation now conserves @xmath158 .",
    "note also that , in contrast to the standard boussinesq approximation , both ohmic and viscous heating terms are included in the energy equation  , these terms arising as a consequence of having increased the magnitude of both the parallel velocity and parallel magnetic field perturbations .",
    "in the previous section , we derived a new set of equations describing the combined effects of magnetic buoyancy instability and an influential shear flow , consistent within the magneto - boussinesq approximation .",
    "as noted above , there are a number of significant differences between these equations and those of @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine how a connection may be made between the two systems . in order to do this",
    ", we again fix @xmath87 , but choose not to impose the conditions of an influential shear , and .",
    "this then allows us to introduce a control parameter @xmath159 , defined by @xmath160 where @xmath159 satisfies @xmath161 and is a measure of the relative sizes of the scale heights of magnetic field and pressure .",
    "varying @xmath159 then allows us to examine how the system of equations changes from when @xmath162 @xcite , in which the velocity shear has no effect on the onset of instability ( see appendix  [ ap : noshear ] ) , to when @xmath163 , the case considered in section  [ sec4 ] . in order to keep the magnitudes of the density fluctuations constant as the parameter @xmath159 varies , we consider , using , basic state magnetic fields of strength @xmath164 the assumption that the alfvn speed is much smaller than the sound speed leads to the inequality @xmath165 . following the ideas of sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] , we can express the required strength of the velocity shear and horizontal length scale in terms of the parameter @xmath159 as @xmath166 although more complicated than the @xmath163 expressions of section  [ sec4 ] , we can nonetheless proceed in a similar manner and express the variables in terms of non - dimensional expansions .",
    "the scalar variables are independent of @xmath159 and are therefore scaled as in  ; the vector quantities may be expanded as    @xmath167    the operators @xmath168 and @xmath169 are scaled as @xmath170 and we adopt the same @xmath159-independent time scale as in , @xmath171    performing the same sequence of operations that lead to equations  , leads to the following @xmath159-dependent mixed - order system of equations :    [ eq : full ] @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176    note that special attention is needed when considering the @xmath177 term in . in more detail",
    ", this term takes the form @xmath178 which , on using , can be written as @xmath179    when @xmath162 , the term enters equation   at leading order , as in @xcite .",
    "this substitution can be performed , however , only for @xmath162 ; for all other values of @xmath159 , this term is formally smaller than those involving @xmath180 and @xmath181 .    from equations  ,",
    "three different systems can be identified , depending on the choice of @xmath159 . for @xmath162",
    "the system reverts to the magneto - boussinesq equations of @xcite , for which the inclusion of a shear flow has no influence on the onset of instability ( appendix  [ ap : noshear ] ) .",
    "the range @xmath182 produces a very similar system , but with no density term in the induction equation . for this system , via the same analysis as in appendix  [ ap : noshear ] , it can again be shown that the shear has no effect on the linearised diffusionless system of equations .",
    "the final system comes from taking @xmath163 , thereby recovering equations  .",
    "it is important to remember that increasing @xmath159 essentially decreases the magnetic field scale height from @xmath81 , where the variations across the layer are small in comparison with the uniform component of @xmath45 , to @xmath183 , where both the uniform component and the variations across the layer are of the same order .",
    "the principal result of this paper is the derivation of a new set of mhd equations governing the evolution of magnetic buoyancy instabilities in the magneto - boussinesq approximation and in the presence of a horizontal , depth - dependent shear flow .",
    "the equations are derived via an expansion procedure in two small parameters : @xmath99 , the ratio of the layer depth to the pressure scale height , and @xmath100 , the ratio of the square of the alfvn speed to the square of the sound speed .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] , which follows the treatment of @xcite to a certain extent , lays the foundations for the magneto - boussinesq orderings in general , without specific reference to the incorporation of any shear flow . unlike @xcite however",
    ", we make no assumption about the magnetic field scale height ; as a result , all the orderings are valid for @xmath47 .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] , with reference to appendix  [ ap : noshear ] , describes how the nave incorporation of a shear flow into the equations of @xcite and @xcite ( i.e.  with @xmath81 ) has no influence on the linear stability problem . in order",
    "that the shear flow assumes a non - trivial role in the magnetic buoyancy instability , two conditions must be met : that @xmath44 is @xmath184 and that @xmath185 . for consistency with the scalings determined in section  [ sec2 ] , it follows that @xmath1 must also be @xmath186 .",
    "the various orderings derived in sections  [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] are applied to the full mhd governing equations in section  [ sec4 ] , yielding the leading order equations  .",
    "interestingly , equations   also allow us to examine the effects of magnetic buoyancy for a magnetic field with an @xmath148 scale height in the absence of velocity shear , a scenario that is excluded from the equations of @xcite , as identified by @xcite .",
    "the transformation between equations   and those of @xcite and @xcite can be effected by increasing the magnetic field scale height from @xmath184 to @xmath187 .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] describes the resulting changes in the governing equations , identifying three different regimes , each with their own set of equations : @xmath183 ( equations  ) , @xmath81 ( @xcite and @xcite ) and a third , intermediate regime .    finally , it is important to consider the implications of our study to the solar tachocline , and , in particular , to examine the parameter regimes in which the set of equations   is expected to hold .",
    "let us first consider the magnitudes of the two small quantities in our asymptotic expansions , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the pressure scale height in the tachocline @xmath188 @xcite .",
    "estimates of the vertical extent of the tachocline vary a little , according to how it is defined ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but lie in the range between @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "thus @xmath191 is certainly less than unity , but is not particularly small . as for the ratio @xmath100 , this is @xmath192 , where @xmath49 is measured in gauss @xcite .",
    "estimates of the mean toroidal field strength in the tachocline result solely from theoretical considerations , and vary between @xmath193 and @xmath194 , depending on the theoretical assumptions involved ; this certainly makes @xmath100 small , in the range @xmath195 .",
    "given that the magnitudes of @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the tachocline suggest , at least _ a priori _ , that a magneto - boussinesq approach is appropriate , we nonetheless need to examine whether the tachocline shear flow inferred from helioseismology is _ influential _ in the sense of equations   and .",
    "equation   specifies that @xmath87 ; this is true of the tachocline , almost by definition .",
    "expression   requires that @xmath51 be comparable with the alfvn speed @xmath196 . since we have a good estimate of @xmath51 from helioseismological inversions , but no direct knowledge of the magnetic field strength @xmath49 , it makes more sense to look at this from the other perspective and to ask what values of @xmath49 will allow to be satisfied . from the helioseismological results of @xcite ,",
    "the jump in the angular velocity across the tachocline ( at the equator ) is of the order of 20 nhz , which translates into @xmath197 . requiring @xmath198 determines the characteristic magnetic field strength as @xmath199 .",
    "thus everything ties together very nicely , suggesting that equations   form an appropriate system for the study of magnetic buoyancy instabilities in the tachocline .",

    "the aim of this appendix is to demonstrate how introducing velocity shear in the ` obvious ' manner into the magneto - boussinesq equations of @xcite and @xcite has no effect on the linear stability of the diffusionless system .",
    "suppose that we consider a basic state magnetic field of the form @xmath200 where @xmath201 .",
    "in addition , we consider an aligned basic state velocity shear @xmath42 , with scale height @xmath44 .",
    "we consider separately the two cases of @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "we suppose that the flow @xmath50 is an arbitrary function of @xmath26 . as a consequence of the @xcite ordering of @xmath86 ,",
    "the advective terms are @xmath204 smaller than the shear terms and hence are neglected . on following @xcite , by linearising the governing equations , ignoring all diffusivities , and adopting @xmath2 as the unit of length and the alfvn period @xmath205 as the unit of time",
    ", we obtain the dimensionless equations , @xmath206 where @xmath191 , @xmath207 , and where , for simplicity , we have taken @xmath208 in the energy equation and made the substitution @xmath209 ( cf",
    ".  equations  ( 40 ) and ( 39 ) in @xcite ) . since @xmath210 and @xmath211",
    ", we may introduce stream and flux functions , @xmath212 and @xmath213 , such that @xmath214 where @xmath215 substituting expressions   into the @xmath216-component of the momentum equation and its curl yields , after dropping the hats , @xmath217 in a similar manner , the induction equation   gives @xmath218 on eliminating @xmath219 between equations   and , we obtain @xmath220 which , after substituting for @xmath213 from , becomes @xmath221 equation  , after substituting for @xmath213 from , and equation   form an eigenvalue problem for @xmath16 involving only the functions @xmath212 and @xmath222 . the crucial point to note is that @xmath223 does not appear in these expressions ; hence the shear has no influence on the growth rate @xmath16 .",
    "if the scale height @xmath44 is comparable with @xmath38 and @xmath1 then the major change to equations   and is that the advective terms come into play .",
    "however , since @xmath50 now varies on a scale very large compared with @xmath2 , this simply represents , to a first approximation , advection by a uniform flow .",
    "a straightforward transformation therefore recovers equations   and ( with @xmath223 now treated as a constant ) .",
    "thus , with the ordering @xmath225 , the imposed shear once again has no bearing on the linear stability problem ."
