    "in year 2006 the group of hideo hosono discovered that the quaternary compound lafepo becomes superconducting at about @xmath1  @xcite . at the time , this observation generated little interest in the condensed - matter community due to the relatively low superconducting transition temperature of this compound , comparable to that of many conventional superconductors  @xcite , its very different crystallographic structure notwithstanding . nevertheless , hosono and collaborators kept faith in this material and continued searching for ways to enhance its superconducting transition temperature .",
    "this search bore fruit when they discovered an order - of - magnitude higher transition temperature in a closely related lafeaso doped with fluorine  @xcite , which immediately propelled the iron - based superconductors into the elite group of the very few with superconducting transition temperatures above @xmath2 , alongside with high - temperature cuprate superconductors  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite , select fullerenes  @xcite , and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this discovery led to explosive development of the field , even more so when only several months later a twice higher superconducting transition temperature was reported in a samarium - based sister material  @xcite .",
    "the crystallographic structure of these iron - based compounds was found to belong to the tetragonal @xmath5 space group symmetry at ambient conditions and feature conductive layers of tetrahedrally coordinated fe and as ions intercalated with rare - earth and oxygen ions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]a .",
    "the layered structure has drawn comparisons to the high - temperature copper - oxide superconductors , in which similar layers are formed by copper and oxygen ions , albeit octahedrally coordinated .",
    "it was soon realized that , unlike in the copper - based materials , the presence of oxygen in iron pnictides is inessential for the occurrence of superconductivity .",
    "transition temperatures up to about @xmath6 were reported upon intercalation of the iron - pnictogen layers with a single - type alkaline earth metal ion with subsequent alio- or isovalent substitution or application of external pressure  @xcite .",
    "somewhat lower but nevertheless substantial superconducting transition temperatures could be attained without any intercalation at all in the binary pbo - type @xmath7fese iron chalcogenide  @xcite .",
    "it is now well - established that tetrahedral coordination of iron ions via a pnictogen or a chalcogen is essential for iron - based superconductivity  @xcite . the iron - pnictogen bond angle or ,",
    "similarly , the pntictogen or chalcogen ion height over the plane formed by iron ions , characterizing the tetrahedral coordination , was found to show a certain correlation with the superconducting transition temperature  @xcite .    in order to gain a more fundamental physical understanding of superconductivity and its dependence on the structure and doping in the iron - based materials ,",
    "the knowledge of their electronic structure is indispensable .",
    "already very early _ ab initio _ calculations have shown that the low - energy band structure of these compounds is formed predominantly by fe-3d orbitals , very weakly hybridized with as-4p orbitals , which commonly produce a rather complex fermi surface with up to five sheets of different electronic character  @xcite .",
    "these calculations further revealed that , as can be expected from their layered structure , the iron - based materials possess a quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]b ) , with seemingly very good nesting ( good geometrical overlap of superimposed portions of the fermi surface ) between the holelike and electronlike fermi - surface sheets in the center and in the corner of the brillouin zone , respectively , which would enhance susceptibility to electronic instabilities leading to the corresponding reconstruction of the brillouin zone .",
    "neutron - scattering measurements have indeed identified long - range antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures in the overwhelming majority of the parent ( undoped ) iron - based materials at a wave vector consistent with the nesting vector predicted by theoretical calculations  @xcite ( with very few exceptions such as , e.g. , lifeas superconductor possessing no magnetism or nesting whatsoever  @xcite and fete , in which the antiferromagnetic wave vector is very different from the nesting vector  @xcite ) .",
    "this very good agreement between theory and experiment , along with the fact that iron - based materials remain metallic in the magnetic state , led the community to believe that antiferromagnetism in these compounds is largely of itinerant nesting - enhanced spin - density  wave type  @xcite .",
    "however , further extensive systematic neutron - scattering studies of most of the known relevant iron - based materials have revealed that their antiferromagnetism bears essentially dual , simultaneously local and itinerant , character  @xcite .",
    "the observation that the superconducting transition temperature in the iron - based materials is maximized when the antiferromagnetism of the parent compounds has been largely or entirely suppressed  @xcite and the theoretical prediction of electron - phonon interaction too small to account for the superconducting transition temperatures found in these compounds  @xcite has led to the suggestion that superconductivity is mediated by nesting - enhanced antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations . as a result",
    ", the superconducting order parameter is expected to possess an @xmath8-wave symmetry  @xcite but exhibit a sign change between the fermi surfaces connected by the antiferromagnetic / nesting wave vector ( the so - called `` extended @xmath8-wave '' , or @xmath9 symmetry ) due to the repulsive character of the mediated interaction  @xcite . an experimental test of this hypothesis is problematic in this case , unlike the historic confirmation of the sign - changing , d - wave , character of the superconducting order parameter in the high - temperature cuprate superconductors  @xcite , because the proposed extended ( sign - changing ) s - wave symmetry preserves the tetragonal symmetry of the underlying lattice .",
    "nevertheless , several proposals for a phase - sensitive test of the symmetry of the superconducting order paramter have been put forward  @xcite and even realized  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that , although the nesting scenario seemed to provide a plausible explanation for the observed ground state of the parent and superconducting iron - based materials at the dawn of their era  @xcite , extensive angle - resolved photoemission experiments have revealed an unusual propellerlike shape of the electron sheets of the fermi surface located in the corners of the brillouin zone , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]c , in a number of iron - based compounds  @xcite , with no significant nesting between the electron- and holelike sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "these measurements have further found that the theoretically predicted electronic band structure can largely be brought into agreement with experiment if the former is renormalized ( in certain materials in a band / orbital - dependent way ) by a factor of about @xmath10@xmath11 up to a certain intermediate energy  @xcite as well as if a band / orbital - dependent fermi - level shifts are introduced  @xcite ( in the  compound a strong temperature dependence of such a shift has been identified in ref .  ) .",
    "similar shifts were found necessary to reconcile _ ab initio _ calculations with the results of quantum - oscillation measurements on many different iron - based compounds  @xcite .",
    "these observations appear to challenge the importance of nesting and instead emphasize the role of the orbital character of the fermi surface for superconducting pairing  @xcite , therefore , lending some support to theories of orbital - fluctuation  mediated pairing  @xcite .",
    "however , while the bandwidth renormalization can be explained by the existence of relatively high - energy electronic correlations , consistent with the observation of ubiquitous high - energy spectral weight in the spin susceptibility via inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite , the band / orbital - dependent shifts have been argued to be a natural consequence of the strong interband interaction in the presence of particle - hole asymmetry in the iron - based compounds  @xcite . in this picture , the experimentally observed complex topology of the fermi surface could be obtained from the underlying well - nested _ bare _ fermi surface ( as obtained in _ ab initio _ calculations ) , once the aforementioned high - energy band renormalization and the band / orbital - dependent shifts have been taken into account .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission experiments have further uncovered the proximity of one or more bands to a band - edge singularity , a type of van hove singularity , in most iron - based superconductors with a relatively high superconducting transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "the intensity and number of such van hove singularities seem to correlate positively with the magnitude of the latter .",
    "* a * ,  several representative classes of the iron - based materials .",
    "the numbers at the top denote the chemical formula of the compound underneath ( for instance , lifeas is a 111 compound ) , while the temperatures at the bottom specify either the superconducting transition temperature of the material itself or the highest @xmath12 obtained by doping or substitution in a material of that type .",
    "the common structural unit of all iron - based compounds is the fe - as tetrahedral layer ( gray areas ) , with the adjacent layers either co - aligned out - of - plane or alternating in orientation .",

    "[ sec : phasediagram ] we will introduce the general phase diagram of iron - based compounds and outline their commonalities and peculiarities manifested in the topology of the phase diagram as well as in the phenomena of coexistence / phase separation of the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases , existence of a quantum critical point beneath the superconducting dome , occurrence of nematicity , and pseudogap .",

    "it then discusses the effect of correlations on the optical conductivity and their importance for superconductivity and considers the issue of quantum criticality . in every section",
    "we try to present experimental results for all classes of the iron - based materials , when available , as well as juxtapose and compare them in the given context .",
    "the only exception are the iron - selenide ( @xmath13k , rb , cs )  compounds , in which phase separation plays an important role and which appear to have somewhat different superconducting properties as compared to the other iron - based superconductors .",
    "these iron selenides are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : selenides ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , main experimental observations based on optical - conductivity measurements of the iron - based materials are briefly summarized and some concluding remarks are made .",
    "the highest superconducting transition temperature observed in a bulk iron - based superconductor ( @xmath0 in @xmath14  @xcite ) is second only to that of high - temperature superconducting cuprate materials .",
    "therefore , a juxtaposition of these two families appears instructive .",
    "as mentioned above , already at the structural level these materials have much in common : they consist of conductive layers of iron and pnictogen / chalcogen in the iron - based materials as compared to those of copper and oxygen in their cuprate counterparts . however , whereas the former remain conductive at all attainable temperatures , pressures , and doping levels  @xcite , the latter are driven insulating by strong electronic correlations  @xcite .",
    "superconductivity in the materials from both families can be induced by providing additional charge carriers via doping , which gives rise to very similar phase diagrams ( shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagcomb ] ) . in the parent state",
    "( without doping ) both types of materials experience a phase transition into an antiferromagnetic state , with a concomitant structural distortion at the same or slightly higher temperature in the case of the iron - based materials .",
    "charge doping of either sign results in a gradual suppression of antiferromagnetism and eventually leads to the appearance of superconductivity in a dome - shaped region of the phase diagram . in the cuprates a high - temeprature suppression of the density of states near the fermi level ( called `` pseudogap '' ) accompanied by the spontaneous breaking of the four - fold rotational symmetry within the unit cell exists over a relatively broad doping range  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a pseudogap has also been reported for some of the iron - based compounds  @xcite .    * a * ,  phase diagram of the electron- and hole - doped cuprate superconductors .",
    "the parent compounds are mott insulators and show local antiferromagnetism with a wave vector of @xmath15 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase region ( red ) extends into that of superconductivity ( yellow ) and in the overlap region the two either coexist or compete with each other . above the nel and/or superconducting transition temperature the so - called pseudogap phase is present , which breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the high - temperature normal state reducing it to @xmath16  @xcite .  *",
    "b * ,  phase diagram of the electron- and hole - doped iron - based superconductors .",
    "the general features are similar to those of the cuprate superconductors : superconductivity in otherwise non - superconducting antiferromagnetic parent compounds can be induced by doping charge carriers of either sign , which results in a weakening of the itinerant antiferromagnetic phase ( pink ) and appearance of a dome - shaped superconducting phase region ( orange ) with coexistence of the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phase at certain doping levels . on the hole - doped side of the phase diagram , e.g. in the  series of compounds , superconductivity has been found to occur continuously up to the complete substitution of potassium for barium  @xcite , with a crossover ( possibly with a phase transition )  @xcite from a nodeless superconducting order parameter in the underdoped , optimally doped and slightly overdoped regions of the phase diagram  @xcite to a nodal one in the extremely overdoped regime  @xcite .",
    "nematic and non - fermi - liquid behavior of the iron - based materials will be discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "panel * a * adapted by permission from macmillan publishers ltd : nature physics ref .  , copyright ( 2011 ) . ]    consideration of these general trends together with the energetics of the collective ground states of the iron- and copper - based materials  @xcite suggests that several factors are of importance for high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "first of all , low dimensionality or , equivalently , strong anisotropy appears to play an important role by reducing the total kinetic energy of itinerant charge carriers through confinement and thus tilting the balance towards higher condensation energy ( difference in the kinetic and potential energy above and below the phase transition ) of electronic collective ground states driven by the reduction of potential energy , as is the case in , e.g. , the conventional bcs theory of superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "secondly , sizable electronic correlations also seem to be indispensable .",
    "these conditions , however , foster a variety of collective ground states , all of which except for superconductivity are localizing , as evidenced by the complex phase diagram of the cuprate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagcomb]a and refs .  ) and",
    "iron - based ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagcomb]b and the discussion below ) superconductors .",
    "such competing states must , therefore , be eliminated by reducing the fermi - surface nesting and/or the strength of electronic correlations driving them , in order to obtain high superconducting transition temperatures .    while the gross features of the phase diagram of the iron - based materials comply quite well with the generic shape presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagcomb]b , its detailed structure does depend significantly on the particular material class .",
    "the phase diagrams of different classes of iron - based superconductors have been extensively compared in excellent previous reviews on the topic  @xcite . here",
    "we would like to emphasize the most recent extensions of these phase diagrams .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagcomb]b , the antiferromagnetic and superconducting regions of the phase diagram overlap significantly at low doping levels , raising the question of how these two phases coexist with each other . at the beginning of the iron - pnictide research",
    "it was believed , for instance , that some materials of the  type ( or 122 type , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro]a ) , such as , show microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity  @xcite , whereas others , such as , undergo intrinsic phase separation  @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental evidence in favor of microscopic phase coexistence in  as well as in  single crystals of sufficiently high quality has emerged  @xcite , proving that phase separation is an extrinsic effect , at least in the 122 iron pnictides .",
    "such coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism implies the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point  @xcite underneath the superconducting dome .",
    "given that microscopically coexisting phases are bound to be strongly intertwined , it may be possible to study the properties of one via the other .",
    "this approach has indeed been realized in a recent study of the london penetration depth , which uncovered that the latter is sharply peaked at the optimal doping level of superconducting  @xcite , thus unambiguously proving the existence of a quantum critical point with respect to doping in this material  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have further demonstrated the existence of a nematic electronic state , which spontaneously breaks the four - fold rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice and induces the structural transition , in several materials of the  type  @xcite . whether the nematic order parameter is driven by spin - nematic or orbital fluctuations",
    "remains unclear  @xcite , which suggests an intimate interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the iron - based superconductors .",
    "this interpretation will gain further support in the following sections based on the results of systematic measurements of the optical conductivity .",
    "yet another aspect of the phase diagram of iron - based superconductors that has received considerable attention in the last several years is the continuity of the superconducting phase region in hole - doped compounds ( left side of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagcomb]b ) throughout the overdoped side up to the terminal hole doping , at which the alkaline earth metal of the parent is completely substituted by an alkali metal thus producing a hole doping of 0.5 electrons per iron ion .",
    "these extremely hole - overdoped materials were found to display very different superconducting and normal - state properties compared to their underdoped and optimally doped counterparts , such as the scaling of the specific - heat jump upon entering the superconducting state with respect to the superconducting transition temperature and thermal transport strongly reminiscent of d - wave superconductors  @xcite , as well as a very large renormalization of the effective mass  @xcite .",
    "if , as it appears to be very likely , the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in these materials is indeed very different from the extended s - wave symmetry widely believed to be possessed by the underdoped and optimally doped 122 materials and given that superconductivity does not vanish upon overdoping  @xcite , a phase transition between the superconducting ground states exhibiting these two different symmetries must occur at intermediate doping levels and might entail a time - reversal ",
    "symmetry breaking  @xcite , which has a large potential for industrial applications .",
    "yet a recent muon - spin  rotation investigation of polycrystalline  materials for @xmath17 failed to detect any time - reversal ",
    "symmetry breaking to the accuracy of the experiment  @xcite . in order to shed definitive light on this issue ,",
    "detailed systematic investigation of an entire doping series on a fine doping grid in the overdoped regime is required .",
    "unfortunately , the synthesis of single - crystalline 122 materials on the hole - overdoped side of the phase diagram has proven challenging  @xcite and will require further efforts of the community .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the charge dynamics of the iron - based materials across their phase diagram . given",
    "that superconductivity in these compounds emerges upon alio- , isovalent substitution , or application of external pressure to the parents , a deep fundamental understanding of the physical properties of the latter in the normal as well as in the low - temperature antiferromagnetic state is essential in order to elucidate the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity .",

    "therefore , the experimental optical investigation of these 122 compounds will set the tone for this and the following sections , with the relatively scarce data available on other materials of the iron - based family provided for comparison where available .      according to the predictions of _ ab initio _ electronic band - structure calculations the intermediate - energy electronic band structure ( within @xmath19 from the fermi level ) of virtually all iron - based materials",
    "is dominated by the more or less hybridized 3d orbitals of iron ions and 4p orbitals of the pnictogen / chalcogen  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : bkfaoptlda]a  and  b ) stems from transitions from the same initial states to strongly hybridized fe - d and as - p states above the fermi level ( green lines in fig .  [ fig : bkfaoptlda]c ) ; * finally , the higher - energy contribution ( blue line in figs .",
    "[ fig : bkfaoptlda]a  and  b ) comes predominantly from transitions from all of the above initial states to ba - d states above the fermi level .",
    "this general structure of the interband optical conductivity is largely independent of the intercalating atom , as demonstrated in ref .   and",
    "summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp122interband ] .",
    "it is evident from the comparison in fig .",

    "according to the assignment above , this shift must come predominantly from the bandwidth renormalization of the fe - d states below the fermi level ( red lines in fig .",

    "as already mentioned , all single - phase iron - based materials remain conductive at all attainable temperatures , doping levels , and pressures .",
    "it implies that the low - energy , far - infrared , optical conductivity can be expected to be dominated by the itinerant - charge - carrier response . such behavior has indeed been observed in all studied compounds of the iron - based family , as will be shown below",
    "however , unlike in conventional metals , the infrared charge dynamics of these materials was found to have pronounced bad - metal characteristics , exhibiting a long high - frequency tail along with a coherent low - frequency response .",
    "this ambivalent response can be modeled with two independent drudelike contributions to the optical conductivity : a very narrow , `` coherent '' , and a broad , `` incoherent '' term , as first demonstrated in ref .   for a representative set of 122 compounds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : twodrude]a  f ) as well as in refs .   for  and later found in other classes of the iron - based family  @xcite and different isostructural compounds ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : twodrude]g  i ) . while the precise properties of the two types of itinerant response to some extent depend on the material composition",
    ", the breakdown into a coherent and incoherent contribution is universal .",
    "it is , therefore , important to understand the origin of these two types of response and their relation to itinerant charge carriers . the most straightforward explanation would be to remember that all iron - based materials are inherently multiband compounds and thus possess multiple electronic subsystems according to the number of fermi - surface sheets . in the case of weakly interacting quasiparticles",
    "the width of the free - charge - carrier response would be dominated by the rate of scattering from impurities in the crystal .",
    "this argument would then lead one to conclude that there are two types of charge carriers in the system : one that experiences very strong impurity scattering , giving rise to the incoherent part of the itinerant response , while the other is subject to much weaker scattering , thus producing a very narrow , coherent , drudelike term in the optical conductivity . since in this case",
    "all of the scattering comes from randomly distributed impurities in the crystal , one may extract the quasiparticle mean - free path from the experimentally obtained scattering rate . in iron - based compounds",
    "the latter is on the order of @xmath26  @xcite . assuming the fermi velocity of about @xmath27  one obtains the mean - free path of @xmath28   , much smaller than the in - plane lattice constant of about @xmath29    and even smaller than the shortest interionic distance  @xcite",
    "this situation is clearly unphysical and suggests that the incoherent term might be unrelated to the itinerant response in the iron - based compounds but rather be a manifestation of low - lying interband transitions , indeed predicted by _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite and recently identified experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however , the total spectral weight of these low - energy transitions ( both in theory and in experiment ) is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the incoherent conductivity term .",
    "moreover , the detailed analysis of the optical spectral weight in  has revealed that only by assigning most of the spectral weight at energies up to @xmath30 to the response of itinerant charge carriers does one find consistency with band - structure renormalization revealed by other probes  @xcite .    * a * , fraction of the coherent drude spectral weight @xmath31 for various transition - metal iron pnictides with the same crystal structure , including one typical underdoped cuprate .",

    "]    the above difficulty with the unphysically small mean - free path inferred from the very large quasiparticle scattering rate of the incoherent term can be completely resolved if one considers interacting quasiparticles . in this case",
    ", the total scattering is a combination of the elastic scattering from impurities in the crystal mentioned above and the inelastic scattering mediated by various bosonic excitation coupled to the itinerant charge carriers ( such as phonons , spin fluctuations , orbital fluctuations , etc . )",
    "the inelastic scattering rate is determined by the strength of the electron - boson interaction and unrelated to the lattice and impurities in the crystal .",
    "good nesting between the hole- and electronlike sheets of the fermi surface originally identified in the iron - based compounds from _ ab initio _ calculations could in principle provide a large enough density of states for the corresponding bosonic excitations to give rise to the observed magnitude of the quasiparticle scattering rate of the incoherent itinerant response .",
    "however , as has been mentioned in the introduction , the experimentally determined fermi surface topology essentially excludes any effective nesting in iron - based compounds .",
    "additionally , the observation of very similar incoherent response in iron - based materials with quite different composition and , as a result , drastically different fermi surfaces and types of dominating charge carriers  @xcite implies that it is unrelated to the specific structure of the fermi surface but rather is a universal feature in this family of compounds  @xcite .",
    "one of the plausible candidates for the source of the strong interactions underlying the incoherent term in the optical conductivity seem to be hunds - coupling orbital correlations between fe - d electrons , predicted to have a sizable intensity and play an important role in the low - energy electrodynamics of the iron - based materials  @xcite .",
    "recent detailed optical study of several isostructural 122 compounds has revealed the presence of the incoherent term in the optical conductivity of various 3d - transition - metal  based materials in stark contrast to its complete absence in @xmath35 ( see fig .  [",

    "a detailed analysis of the relative intensity of the coherent and incoherent contributions to the optical conductivity as a function of doping has revealed a pronounced dependence of the degree of incoherence on the pnictogen - transition metal - pnictogen bond angle and the electron filling of the transition - metal 3d orbitals ( fig .",

    "it , therefore , appears that strong electronic correlations are an essential ingredient of high - temperature superconductivity in the iron - based materials .",
    "the importance of orbital physics in the iron - based superconductors is further reflected in the correlation between the magnitude of the superconducting energy gap and the orbital character of the fermi - surface sheets on which it occurs , identified by means of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite .    in the case of interacting quasiparticles the traditional drude expression for the optical conductivity of itinerant charge carriers can be generalized to the so - called extended drude model  @xcite .",
    "the complex optical conductivity @xmath38 , determined by two real - valued functions of frequency @xmath39 and @xmath40 , is uniquely expressed in this model in terms of two different functions : frequency - dependent quasiparticle scattering rate @xmath41 and mass renormalization @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the bare quasiparticle effective mass .",
    "since such a mapping always exists for an arbitrary shape of the optical conductivity , whether it truly represents itinerant - charge - carrier response or not , extreme care must be taken in the interpretation of the results of such a data analysis .",
    "as it so happens , several properties of the iron - based materials eloquently highlight the main difficulties of the extended - drude approach .",
    "the first complication comes from the relatively low - lying intense interband transitions .",

    ", the lowest - energy pronounced optical absorption band is located around @xmath21@xmath45@xmath46 , i.e. well beyond the frequency range of interest for the extended drude analysis and thus of little concern . however , this analysis essentially depends not only on the real part of the optical conductivity but also on its imaginary part . while the influence of the @xmath47 band on the former is negligible , that on the latter is substantial _ in spite _ of the fact that it lies well beyond the spectral range of interest because it makes a very large contribution to the total zero - frequency interband permittivity of the order of 60 .",
    "the importance of the constant contribution of each interband transition to the real part of the dielectric function ( or , equivalently , to the imaginary part of the optical conductivity : @xmath48 well below the resonance frequency of that transition is often forgotten because in the overwhelming majority of materials this contribution is very small , adding up to a value of order unity .",
    "the iron - based compounds are one of the prominent exceptions .",
    "figure  [ fig : extdrude ] demonstrates the effect of unsubtracted interband transitions above @xmath47 on the extended drude analysis below @xmath49 in the low - temperature normal state of superconducting .",
    "it is clear that , with all interband transitions eliminated , the quasiparticle scattering rate saturates above @xmath50 .",
    "quite on the contrary , if the extended drude analysis is carried out on the raw data then the quasiparticle scattering rate shows a linear increase up to very high frequencies .",
    "albeit such a linear frequency dependence is a mere artifact of the data analysis it can be mistaken for the signatures of strong electronic correlations or a quantum critical point  @xcite . in light of the recently reported observation of low - energy absorption bands around @xmath49 and @xmath51 in  ( albeit of rather low intensity )  @xcite in line with the theoretical predictions  @xcite even more care should be exercised in order not to misinterpret the extrinsic effect of interband transition as intrinsic properties of itinerant charge carriers .",

    "the second complication in the extended - drude analysis of the optical conductivity of the iron - based materials comes from the inherently multiband character of the latter , which implies the existence of multiple electronic subsystems , each with its own quasiparticle properties . in the case of a single - band material with weakly interacting quasiparticles",
    "the extended drude analysis of the optical conductivity provides physically correct result : constant quasiparticle scattering rate equal to the elastic scattering rate from random impurities in the crystal , as well as unity effective - mass renormalization . in the multiband case , however , even if the quasiparticles in all of the bands are weakly interacting , a simple application of the extended drude analysis to the total optical conductivity of all bands will result in a frequency - dependent quasiparticle scattering rate and effective - mass renormalization . even though the procedure is mathematically correct and the result is unique , its interpretation is difficult , unless all bands have very similar properties , which is not the case for the iron - based compounds .",

    "however , there is a significant risk of mistaking multiband effects for intrinsic properties of quasiparticle interactions .      upon lowering the temperature ,",

    "the materials enter an antiferromagnetically ordered phase that exhibits a finite magnetic moment on iron ions and a corresponding reconstruction of the brillouin zone  @xcite but retains metallic properties .",
    "the latter , together with the early observation of a relatively small ordered moment , suggested that the antiferromagnetic state in the iron - based materials is of itinerant character and thus is driven by the nesting instability of the fermi surface at a commensurate nesting vector connecting the hole and the electron sheets of the fermi surface predicted by _",

    "the low - energy modification of the electronic band structure induced by the antiferromagnetic phase transition can be probed effectively by studying its effect on the charge dynamics reflected in the optical conductivity .",
    "already very first investigations of the latter in many different iron - based parent compounds revealed a strong suppression of the infrared conductivity at the nel temperature below a certain energy  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sdw ] . due to the conservation of the total number of electrons , the missing area under the conductivity curve below this energy",
    "is transferred to higher energies , which results in the formation of a `` hump '' structure  @xcite . in the case of itinerant magnetism the above suppression in the optical conductivity results from the opening of the so - called spin - density  wave energy gap at the hot spots of the fermi surface ( portions of the fermi surface connected by the nesting vector ) . in the most common case of imperfect nesting the hot spots and , consequently",
    ", the spin - density  wave gap do not cover the entire fermi surface . therefore , the material remains metallic in the low - symmetry state , with the optical conductivity non - zero at all frequencies .",
    "this circumstance makes the determination of the optical spin - density  wave energy gap @xmath58 from the conductivity spectra difficult but it can be approximated by the energy , at which the low - temperature conductivity spectrum crosses the one at the nel temperature for the first time  @xcite .",
    "having estimated the energy gap one may proceed to calculate the corresponding gap ratio @xmath59 , i.e. the ratio of the optical energy gap @xmath58 and the nel temperature in energy units @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the boltzmann constant .",

    ". a systematic comparison of the gap ratios of three common -type iron - based parent compounds was given in ref .  .",
    "this study found a clear trend towards stronger coupling with decreasing atomic number of the intercalating atom : from barium via strontium to calcium .",
    "a similar trend was found in the total plasma frequency of the itinerant charge carriers , with  being significantly more metallic than the other two materials .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdw ] , the optical conductivity of  and  reveals a change in its shape at lowest frequencies at @xmath62 as compared to intermediate temperatures below @xmath63 , which indicates the presence of another spin - density  wave gap , with a smaller magnitude .",
    "this feature has also been observed in  and  compounds in ref .   and ref .",
    ", respectively , and associated with a second spin - density  wave energy gap .",
    "the existence of two separate spin - density  wave energy gaps raises a question as to the degree of interaction between the corresponding electronic subsystems .",
    "this question becomes particularly difficult to address in the presence of as many fermi - surface sheets as is the case in the iron - based materials , which commonly possess up to five separate fermi - surface sheets in the first brillouin zone .",
    "this complexity arises mainly due to the fact that the optical conductivity represents an intertwined response of all electronic subsystems at once . to shed some light onto this issue detailed measurements in the far - infrared spectral range ( i.e. in the range where the real part of the optical conductivity experiences a drastic suppression , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdw ] ) on a very fine temperature grid were carried out for three 122 parent materials in ref .  .",
    "the results are compiled in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdwgaps ] , which shows the temperature dependence of the optical conductivity normalized to its value at @xmath64 close to @xmath63 ( @xmath65 for the ca- , sr- , and ba - based compounds , respectively ) at an equidistant set of wavenumbers from @xmath66 ( blue colors ) to @xmath67 ( red colors ) in steps of @xmath68 with the exception of the spectral window of the @xmath69 phonon for the ca- and sr - based compounds , as well as from @xmath70 to @xmath71 for @xmath53 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the normalized conductivity shows a very pronounced drop for all compounds at their respective nel temperatures ( right vertical dashed lines ) due to the onset of spin - density  wave order , with a clear mean - field order - parameter  like temperature dependence at large wavenumbers ( red colors ) .",
    "this temperature dependence changes , however , as one moves toward progressively smaller wavenumbers and in the case of @xmath72 reveals a clear second suppression feature at a temperature @xmath73 of about @xmath74 .",
    "this second feature becomes washed out in the sr - based compound , although the temperature dependence of @xmath75 at smallest wavenumbers remains markedly different from that at large wavenumbers and some sort of an analogue of @xmath73 can be sketched also in this case , although there is no clear second suppression feature present in any of the separate temperature dependences themselves . finally , in the case of @xmath53 , the change in the temperature dependence of @xmath75 between large and small wavenumbers becomes hardly noticeable , with the exception of an upturn in its temperature dependence at intermediate frequencies due to the pile - up of the spectral weight transferred from the energies below the smaller spin - density  wave energy gap .",
    "the presence of the second suppression feature in the temperature dependence of the real part of the optical conductivity at small enough wavenumbers in @xmath72 indicates , that the electronic subsystem that develops the smaller spin - density  wave energy gap @xmath76 preserves some knowledge about its own nel temperature that it _ would have _ if this subsystem were completely independent from the other(s ) . in any real material all electronic subsystems are coupled , even if weakly , so that all spin - density  wave energy gaps open at the same @xmath63 . however , in case of weak intersubsystem coupling , those with smaller gaps exhibit an anomaly below the real nel temperature , as is the case in @xmath72 , albeit this anomaly does not correspond to a true phase transition .",
    "such an effect has been predicted theoretically for the analogous case of multiband superconductivity  @xcite and discovered experimentally in @xmath77 in refs .  .",
    "the corresponding non - bcs temperature dependence of the smaller superconducting gap resulting from weak interband coupling seems to be consistent with the scanning tunneling spectroscopy data obtained on the lifeas compound  @xcite .",
    "this argument thus suggests that in the ca - based material the two electronic subsystems developing the large and the small spin - density  wave energy gap are weakly coupled .",
    "naturally , as the coupling between such electronic subsystems increases , the temperature dependence of the small gap would gradually approach that of the large gap via an intermediate state when it already does not show any anomaly but still has not matched the temperature dependence of the large gap .",
    "figure  [ fig : sdwgaps]b provides evidence for such a behavior in the sr - based iron pnictide .",
    "finally , the temperature dependence of the normalized optical conductivity in @xmath53 is almost the same at all wavenumbers , both in the region of the large spin - density  wave gap and in that of the small one , indicating strongly coupled electronic subsystems in this compound .",
    "thus , by monitoring the detailed temperature dependence of the optical conductivity in the far - infrared spectral range on a fine grid of wavenumbers , a gradual transition could be observed from weak coupling between the electronic subsystems developing the two different spin - density  wave energy gaps in @xmath72 , via intermediate coupling in @xmath54 , to strong coupling between them in @xmath53 , systematically with increasing atomic number of the intercalant .",
    "we have consistently emphasized throughout this review that , albeit originally believed to be purely itinerant , the antiferromagnetism of the iron - based compounds has been found to bear essentially dual , itinerant and local , character  @xcite .",
    "it suggests that the spectral - weight redistribution found in the optical conductivity of antiferromagnetic compounds might be driven by local - moment physics as well as by the opening of a spin - density  wave energy gap due to collective long - range order .",
    "this idea has indeed received significant attention .",
    "for instance , the authors of ref .   have assigned the smaller and the larger gaplike features in , similar to those discussed above , to two different sets of optical transitions : related to transitions within the spin - minority bands formed by fe ions with the same spin and , therefore , sensitive to the long - range magnetic order and between the spin - majority and the spin - minority bands formed by fe sites with opposite spins , respectively .",
    "the latter is mostly defined by the exchange splitting of the local magnetic moment due to hund s coupling and thus less sensitive to the long - range order .",
    "calculations taking into account electronic correlations based on a combination of the density - functional and dynamic - mean - field theory have likewise emphasized that it is the gain of hunds - coupling energy rather than hubbard repulsion energy that compensates the loss in kinetic energy and thus stabilizes the low - temperature antiferromagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "the same study has achieved a remarkable agreement in the overall shape between the calculated and experimentally obtained infrared conductivity of  in the antiferromagnetic ground state , albeit with a substantially overestimated electronic background  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations in both ref .   and ref .",
    "have shown that the significant role played by hund s coupling in the magnetism of the iron - based compounds leads to a modification of the electronic band structure on the energy scale of several electron - volts in the antiferromagnetic ground state compared to the high - temperature paramagnetic state .",
    "a detailed ellipsometric study of the  compound  @xcite and its subsequent systematic comparison to the and  compounds  @xcite have revealed that energies even higher than expected , on the order of @xmath78 are in fact affected by the antiferromagnetic phase transition , as shown in fig .",

    "such a detailed analysis reveals that the doping dependence of the anisotropy of both the residual dc resistivity and the quasiparticle scattering rate of the coherent term in the optical conductivity is linear up to the doping level of @xmath92 and shows a pronouced anisotropy , whereas the spectral weight of the coherent term is isotropic and only weakly depends on the cobalt concentration  @xcite .",
    "this result implies that the anisotropy of the dc resistivity in the antiferromagnetic phase is extrinsic and is likely driven by the anisotropic impurity potential of randomly distributed cobalt dopants  @xcite , polarized by the anisotropic antiferromagnetic environment  @xcite .",
    "such anisotropic impurity states have indeed been directly visualized by means of scatting tunneling spectroscopy in a related isostructural  system  @xcite .",
    "the doping level of @xmath92 represents a clear turning point in the doping dependence of the dc - resistivity anisotropy : below this level the latter increases with cobalt concentration and decreases above it  @xcite .",

    "it is noteworthy that this doping level is very close to the zero - temperature boundary of the superconducting region of the phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the decrease of the anisotropy of the residual dc resistivity beyond the doping level of @xmath92 is consistent with the weakening of the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic phase and the splitting of the iron @xmath90 and @xmath91 orbitals  @xcite in the absence of external pressure towards the doping level at which the structural and nel temperatures reduce to zero .",
    "it is , however , worth noting that a recent study of the linear dichroism in the x - ray absorption of the same  family of compounds has revealed the existence of anisotropic orbital fluctuations stabilized to long - range orbital order under applied pressure well beyond this doping level ( at least up to @xmath93 )  @xcite .",

    "this interpretation is consistent with the spectroscopic observation of several contributions to the coherent component of the optical conductivity in , one of which was found to be extremely narrow and suggested to originate in the topologically protected from backscattering sheet of the fermi surface formed by bands with a dirac - cone  shape dispersion  @xcite .",
    "the cobalt concentration of @xmath95 also marks the reversal in the spin - density - wave  induced modification of the dc resistivity , which goes from experiencing a suppression at the nel temperature below this doping level to being enhanced at higher doping levels , as can be clearly seen in fig .",

    "this behavior can be easily explained with the help of the spectroscopic data in figs .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy]b  g . to understand the origin of this phenomenon one needs to remember that the suppression / enhancement of the dc resistivity ( @xmath96 , where @xmath86 is the total elastic scattering rate , @xmath97 is the plasma frequency of itinerant charge carriers , and @xmath98 is the electron density ) at a spin - density  wave transition is governed by two competing effects , both due to the partial gapping of the fermi surface : a decrease in the quasiparticle density , which increases the dc resistivity , and a reduction of the quasiparticle scattering rate due to the elimination of some scattering channels , which decreases the dc resistivity .",
    "it is quite clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy]a that at low doping levels the latter effect dominates and the dc resistivity is significantly reduced below the nel temperature .",
    "the corresponding reduction of the quasiparticle scattering rate below the antiferromagnetic transition can be clearly seen in the spectroscopic data in figs .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy]b , c . the aforementioned reversal of the suppression in figs .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy]a can now be explained by the gradual decrease in the intensity of the reduction of the quasiparticle scattering rate at the phase transition upon cobalt doping so that at @xmath92 the two factors in the dc resistivity are comparable and at higher doping levels the decrease in the quasiparticle density starts to dominate and the dc resistivity is enhanced below the nel temperature . the assumption that the gapping of the fermi surface below the spin - density  wave transition temperature indeed changes significantly from @xmath99 to @xmath92 is further confirmed by the dramatic reduction of the overall suppression in the optical conductivity with increasing cobalt concentration : at @xmath92 not only does the quasiparticle scattering rate not show a significant reduction but the overall temperature dependence of the infrared conductivity is rather weak ( see figs .",

    "one of the possible explanations for this behavior is the difference in the degree of electronic screening of ionic vibrations in the ferro- and antiferromagnetic directions due to the anisotropic optical conductivity originating in significant hund s coupling and has been outlined in the previous section .",

    "this anisotropy of the phonon intensity , most pronounced in the parent  compound  @xcite , gradually decreases upon cobalt substitution , which provides additional evidence that the electronic state in the antiferromagnetic phase becomes progressively less polarizable towards the optimal doping level .    finally , we would like to note that the @xmath47 absorption band , discussed in detail above and renormalized by strong hunds - coupling correlations  @xcite , exhibits a pronounced anisotropy in its temperature dependence in the antiferromagnetic state , as can be seen in figs .

    "since the interaction due to the exchange of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations is repulsive , the general form of the gap equation  @xcite maintains that the formation of cooper pairs can only take place if the superconducting order parameter has opposite signs on different portions of the fermi surface , in stark contrast to the sign - constant superconducting order parameter in all conventional superconductors  @xcite .",

    "superconductivity is an electronic instability of the entire fermi surface , which implies that all quasiparticle excitations are gapped in the superconducting ground state with the exception of the nodal regions , if any . in the case of the iron - based superconductors it amounts to the presence of as many superconducting energy gaps as there are sheets of the fermi surface of either electronic character . in all materials ,",

    "the authors of ref .   succeeded in directly observing one of the optical superconducting energy gaps @xmath126 as the energy at which the real part of the terahertz conductivity drops to the background level .",
    "furthermore , virtually all terahertz transmission studies have reported the presence of a coherence peak in the real part of the optical conductivity , which manifests itself as a slight enhancement of the optical conductivity at low enough energies just below the superconducting transition temperature as compared to its overall suppression at higher energies and lower temperatures .",
    "this behavior is a hallmark of superconductivity , very well understood in the conventional bcs and eliashberg theory of superconductivity , and stems from the formation of highly coherent superconducting pairs  @xcite and/or the elimination of quasiparticle scattering channels below the optical superconducting energy gap  @xcite .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the existence of a coherence peak in the low - energy optical conductivity is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for superconductivity as in certain circumstances it can be partially or fully suppressed  @xcite .    according to the ferrell - glover - tinkham sum rule  @xcite , the missing area under the infrared conductivity curve as compared to that in the normal state",
    "is transferred into the coherent response of the superconducting condensate at zero frequency .",
    "it manifests itself in the most fundamental properties of superconductors : zero dc resistivity and meissner effect .",
    "the latter is characterized by the london penetration depth @xmath127 for the magnetic field , which is related to the missing area @xmath128 via @xmath129 ( in cgs units ) , where @xmath130 is the speed of light .",
    "the missing area obtained from the integration of the optical conductivity of the iron - based superconductors typically gives a london penetration depth on the order of @xmath131@xmath132   , consistent with other measurements  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , the superconductivity - induced suppression of the optical conductivity with non - zero missing area has also been discovered in optimally doped  in the visible spectral range  @xcite , at energies two orders of magnitude larger than the superconducting energy gap , as demonstrated in figs .  [",

    "some exotic theories of superconductivity have proposed a mechanism by which the superconductivity - induced suppression of the optical spectral weight could extend to the spectral range of interband transitions  @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .   have demonstrated , however , that the observed effect can be understood phenomenologically in conventional terms by utilizing the inherently multiband nature of the iron - based superconductors .",
    "the suppression of an interband transition over its entire width with a local non - conservation of the spectral weight implies a change in the oscillator strength of this transition , which can take place due to the modification of the occupation in either initial or final states that its spans .",
    "since all conventional superconductivity - induced modifications of the electronic structure and dynamics occur in the vicinity of the fermi level within several values of the superconducting energy gap , one may conclude that the only conventional way for an interband transition to feel the effect of superconductivity is for its initial or final states to be largely concentrated in this vicinity .",
    "however , this mechanism by itself would not entail any loss of spectral weight in the considered interband transition because the opening of the superconducting energy gap leads to the expulsion of electronic states from within the gap to above it with the total number of states conserved ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkfacoloring]*d * with gray and blue lines and areas ) .",
    "therefore , the corresponding modifications in the interband optical conductivity would be limited to small shifts / corrugations on the order of the superconducting energy gap  @xcite with the total spectral weight conserved . in the present case ,",

    "a scenario would be impossible and exotic mechanisms would have to be invoked to explain the observed suppression .",

    "strongly coupled to each other  @xcite , a population redistribution could and does indeed occur dynamically between the strongly coupled sheets of the fermi surface  @xcite and could lead to a static population imbalance in the superconducting state should it be energetically favorable",
    ". this latter condition can be fulfilled in a multiband superconductor due to the well - known , albeit very small , effect of the change in the chemical potential upon entering the superconducting state  @xcite , proportional to the square of the superconducting energy gap . in case",
    "a material features different magnitudes of the superconducting energy gap on different sheets of the fermi surface and/or a different character of the charge carriers ( electrons vs. holes ) , there will be a band- or orbital - specific shift of the chemical potential leading to a population redistribution between different bands .",

    "this is close to the condensation energy @xmath134 obtained from specific - heat measurements on the same sample  @xcite .",
    "it thus remains to be seen whether the physics behind this phenomenon is of consequence for superconductivity of multiband materials .",

    "the aforementioned theoretical predictions and experimental observations together with the prediction and observation of orbital - selective quasiparticle mass renormalization and band shifts with respect to the results of the density - functional theory  @xcite further support the importance of the hunds - coupling correlations  @xcite for superconductivity in the iron - based superconductors .    finally , a recent theoretical investigation of the interplay between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in phase - separated iron selenides suggested a long - sought rationale for maximizing the superconducting transition temperature in the iron - based superconductors : it has identified , based on a two - layer model , that the transition temperature in these phase - separated materials could be suppressed by interlayer hopping  @xcite between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phase at the interface and minimization of this hopping could lead to superconducting transition temperatures on the order of @xmath188  @xcite . in this regard it appears remarkable that in the class of binary iron selenides , the simplest iron - based superconductors , a significant increase in the transition temperature to @xmath189 with respect to that of bulk fese ( @xmath190 ) has been demonstrated by intercalating the iron - selenium layers with large molecular complexes  @xcite and to @xmath188 by isolating a single monolayer of fese on a @xmath191 substrate  @xcite , in which the interlayer hopping is either minimized or , in the latter case , completely absent .",
    "in summary , we have reviewed the developments in the field of high - temperature unconventional iron - based superconductivity since their discovery in 2006 , largely through the prism of itinerant - charge - carrier dynamics investigated by means of optical spectroscopy . in the parent compounds ,",
    "the effect of the antiferromagnetic phase transition on the optical conductivity has been clearly demonstrated by the observed redistribution of the optical spectral weight from low to high frequencies in the vicinity of the corresponding characteristic energies ( optical energy gaps ) due to the modification of the electronic structure at the phase transition .",
    "some evidence for the inherently dual , simultaneously itinerant and local , character of antiferromagnetism in the iron - based compounds has been derived from the analysis of the infrared conductivity across the transition .",
    "detailed investigation of the temperature dependence of the infrared conductivity of various parent iron pnictides has demonstrated the evolution of coupling between the low - energy and intermediate - energy electronic subsystems affected by the antiferromagnetic phase transition from weak in  via intermediate in  to strong in , systematically with the atomic number of the intercalant .",
    "all infrared - active modes expected in the high - temperature tetragonal phase have been observed in all compounds along with their modification at the concomitant structural transition , with some evidence for sizable hunds - coupling correlations derived from the anomalous line shape of some of the phonons .",
    "the dispersion analysis of iron - based materials has revealed that the overall structure of the interband absorption bands in the optical conductivity at energies above @xmath192 can be well reproduced by standard _",
    "ab initio _ density - functional calculations in the local - density approximation .",
    "we have emphasized that the interband transitions in the iron - based compounds make an unusually large contribution on the order of @xmath193 to the zero - frequency permittivity and , therefore , must be explicitly taken into account lest significant artifacts arise in the analysis of the itinerant - charge - carrier response by means of the extended - drude theory .",
    "likewise , the multiband character of the iron - based superconductors must be considered in order to account for the frequency dependence of the quasiparticle scattering rate and mass renormalization due to the contribution of multiple bands to the optical conductivity before other sources of this frequency dependence such as the interaction with bosonic excitations are involved . in the infrared spectral range , the optical conductivity of the iron - based compounds has been found to exhibit two well - discernible contributions according to the regime of quasiparticle coherence distinguished based on the strength of the quasiparticle scattering rate : a broad incoherent and a narrow coherent term .",
    "this observation is consistent with the established inherently multiband character of the iron - based materials , with several ( up to five ) sheets of the fermi surface of both electron and hole character contributing to the itinerant dynamics .",
    "the general shape of the infrared conductivity both in the normal and in the antiferromagnetic state has been demonstrated to be well - captured by dynamical - mean - field - theory theoretical calculations explicitly taking into account sizable hunds - coupling correlations between quasiparticles .",
    "the occurrence of superconductivity has been shown to correlate with the degree of incoherence of the narrow contribution to the itinerant - charge - carrier response and the latter  with the pnictogen bond angle and electron filling , which provide a measure of the degree of electronic correlations .",
    "parent compounds in the 122 class of the iron - based materials have further revealed the presence of pronounced electronic nematicity in the nominally tetragonal state above the antiferromagnetic and structural phase transition .",
    "the corresponding anisotropy , originally observed in the dc transport , has now been reliably established by means of many different techniques , including investigations of the optical conductivity , and traced back to the orbital anisotropy in the ( stabilized by detwinning pressure or strain ) orthorhombic state and corresponding large nematic / orbital susceptibility in the tetragonal state close to the phase transition .",
    "the existence of a nematic instability due to spin / orbital fluctuations and their strong coupling to the lattice demonstrate the intimate connection between these three fundamental degrees of freedom in the iron - based compounds .    in the superconducting compounds , the hallmark of superconductivity  the missing area in the infrared conductivity ",
    "has been observed in all investigated materials and has been shown to be consistent with a nodeless superconducting energy gap(s ) , supporting the established view of the extended @xmath8-wave symmetry ( fully gapped with a sign change between different sheets of the fermi surface in the brillouin zone ) of the superconducting order parameter in most materials of this family of superconductors .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission measurements have revealed an unusual clustering of the superconducting gaps into two groups with respect to their magnitude , widely observed with other techniques , and their strong dependence on the orbital character of the underlying electronic structure .",
    "it has been demonstrated that , based on an extensive comparison of various conventional and unconventional high - temperature superconductors , the iron - based materials appear to span a wide range of the coupling regime from weak to strong coupling .",
    "the applicability of the widely used mattis - bardeen theory for the description of the optical conductivity to the case of iron - based superconductors beyond the weak - coupling regime has been shown to be questionable at best and in the case of strongly coupled superconductors in the clean limit with respect to impurity scattering  completely inadequate .",
    "analysis of the optical conductivity in the framework of the eliashberg theory of superconductivity has shown that it is largely consistent with pairing driven by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "this premise has been strongly supported by the observation of the inherent linear temperature dependence of the dc resistivity in the coherent channel ( narrow contribution to the itinerant - charge - carrier response ) , associated with strong coupling to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , as well as the recovery of the conventional fermi - liquid @xmath136 dependence upon the application of a spin - stabilizing magnetic field . in some but",
    "not all iron - based superconductors a quantum critical point and the associated finite - temperature quantum - critical regime have been identified .",
    "the relation of quantum - critical fluctuations to superconducting pairing , however , remains unclear .",
    "intriguingly , the changes in the optical conductivity induced by both the antiferromagnetic and superconducting phase transition have been shown to affect energies much higher than the characteristic energies of either , most pronouncedly superconducting , phase .",
    "this effect can be explained quite naturally by a population redistribution between different electronic bands due to a band / orbital - specific shift of the chemical potential in the symmetry broken state , an effect that up to now has not been accounted for self - consistently by any of the widely employed theories of superconductivity .",
    "the recently discovered addition to the family of iron - based superconductors , iron - selenide materials of nominally 122 type , have been found to exhibit quite high superconducting transition temperatures of @xmath142 simultaneously with exceptionally strong antiferromagnetism with nel temperatures of about @xmath194 .",
    "this peculiar coexistence has been demonstrated to occur in the form of unusual nanoscale phase separation between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phase in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "the transport properties of these materials show a clear temperature - induced semiconductor - metal crossover , likely attributable to the observed orbital - selective mott transition , at which one of the electronic orbitals gets localized while the rest remain itinerant .",
    "the latter observation further emphasizes the aforementioned importance of orbital physics for the electronic properties of the iron - based materials and superconductivity therein .    while several important questions in the physics of the iron - based superconductors remain open , such as the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter and the precise pairing mechanism , it is clear that a synergistic consideration of their multiband electronic structure , the dual , itinerant and local , character of antiferromagnetism in the parent compounds , as well as the complex intimate interplay between the spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom is key to a complete understanding of these fascinating materials .",
