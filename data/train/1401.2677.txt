    "the ( reduced ) _ burau representation _ @xmath0\\right)\\ ] ] was the first possible candidate for a faithful linear representation of the braid group on @xmath1 strands @xmath2 and it has been known for long to be faithful in the case of the 3-strand braid group  @xcite .",
    "however , moody @xcite showed that the burau representation is not faithful for any braid index @xmath3 .",
    "this was brought down to @xmath4 by long and paton @xcite and finally bigelow showed the non - faithfulness of @xmath5 @xcite . despite these negative results ,",
    "the linearity question of the braid groups was settled in the positive independently by krammer @xcite and bigelow @xcite .",
    "they showed that another linear representation @xmath6\\right)\\ ] ] constructed by lawrence @xcite is faithful for all @xmath1 .",
    "the representation @xmath7 is now known as the _ lawrence - krammer - bigelow representation _ , or lkb representation for short .    at present , the question of the faithfulness of the burau representation in the case @xmath8 remains open .",
    "the linearity question itself was solved , nevertheless the problem to determine whether @xmath9 is faithful or not remains of considerable importance : a negative answer would be of great interest in quantum topology , since it is equivalent to the non - faithfulness of jones and temperley - lieb representations of @xmath10 , and would provide a non - trivial knot with trivial jones polynomial @xcite .",
    "another interesting related problem is to study the image of the burau representation  an old question asks which @xmath11 matrices over @xmath12 $ ] can appear as the image under the ( reduced ) burau representation of some braid @xcite ; it is widely open .",
    "the present paper aims to establish relations between the garside structures of the braid group and the burau representation .",
    "our motivation was to understand to what extent the burau representation is close to be faithful , and when faithfulness property breaks down .",
    "this not only helps to attack the faithfulness problem of the 4-strand burau representation , but also provides new insights for the image and the kernel of the burau representation for arbitrary braid index , even for the simplest case @xmath13 ( see corollary [ cor:3strands ] below ) .",
    "the _ classical garside structure _ consists in a lattice structure together with a special element @xmath14 satisfying some properties initially discovered by garside in @xcite .",
    "a crucial output of this structure is the _ classical ( left ) normal form _ of a braid @xmath15 , which is a unique decomposition of the form @xmath16 in which the factors belong to the set of the so - called _",

    "if the classical left normal form of a 4-braid @xmath15 does not contain a factor @xmath28 then @xmath29 .    in the dual framework , we obtain more general and strong connections . for a non - zero laurent polynomial @xmath30 in the variable @xmath31 ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath32 and @xmath33 the minimal and maximal degrees of the variable , respectively . as a convention , we define @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    for a matrix @xmath36\\right)$",
    "] , we set @xmath37    in section [ section : dual ] we will introduce a notion of _ simply - nested _ braid ; roughly speaking , simply - nestedness is a local condition on the factors of the dual left normal form of a braid .",
    "we will show that the burau representation completely determines the normal form of simply - nested braids .",
    "let @xmath38 be a simply - nested braid .",
    "1 .   @xmath39 .",
    "2 .   one can compute the dual normal form from the matrix @xmath40 , so the restriction of the burau representation on the set of simply - nested braid @xmath41 is injective .",
    "this provides several consequences for faithfulness questions in general .",
    "first of all , it follows that the burau matrix of a 3-strand braid completely determines its dual normal form .",

    "then    1 .",
    "@xmath43 , 2 .",

    "finally we give garside - theoretical constraints for braids of arbitrary braid index to belong to the kernel of the burau representation .",

    "@xmath60 ,    then @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we conclude that if a braid @xmath15 is sufficiently close to simply nested braids , then its burau matrix is never trivial .",
    "now we explain the organization of the paper . in section [ section : garside ] we recall garside theoretical no(ta)tions to be used later . section [ section : classical ] shows theorem [ theorem : main_classical ] .",
    "sections [ section : diagrams]-[section : dual ] are devoted to the proof of theorem [ theorem : main_dual ] . this can be sketched as follows .",
    "first we recall from @xcite the wall - crossing labeling of the curve diagram of a braid and how it is related to the dual garside normal form ( section [ section : diagrams ] ) .",
    "section [ section : burau ] reviews a homological interpretation of the reduced burau representation ; in this context we show how the burau matrix is related to the wall - crossing labeling .",
    "wall - crossing labeling therefore serves as a bridge between burau representation and the dual garside structure .",
    "finally , section [ section : dual ] introduces the notion of simply - nestedness and proves theorem [ theorem : main_dual ] and its above mentionned corollaries .",
    "let @xmath62 be the closed disk in @xmath63 with diameter the real segment @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 be the @xmath1-times punctured disk : @xmath66 .",
    "we denote the @xmath67-th puncture point @xmath68 by @xmath69 and put @xmath70 .",
    "as is well - known , the braid group @xmath71 is identified with the mapping class group of @xmath72 ( with boundary fixed pointwise ) .",
    "we identify the standard artin generator @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) with the _ left - handed _",

    "i.e. those braids which can be expressed as words on the letters @xmath85 with only positive exponents . since the works of garside @xcite , thurston @xcite , and elrifai and morton @xcite , it is well - known that the monoid @xmath84 induces a lattice order @xmath86 on @xmath2 called the _ prefix _ order , through the relation @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 .",
    "the positive left - divisors ( with respect to @xmath86 ) of the half - twist of all strands @xmath89 are finitely many and generate the group @xmath2 .",
    "these are called _ simple elements _ ( or _ positive permutation braids _ , because they are in one - to - one correspondence with the symmetric group on @xmath1 objects ) .",
    "simple elements have been extensively studied in @xcite , where a nice geometric description of them is given : a positive braid @xmath15 is a simple element if and only if each pair of strands in @xmath15 has at most one crossing . the pair @xmath90 is generally called _ classical ( usual ) garside structure _ of the braid group .    an ordered pair of two simple elements @xmath91 is said to be _ left - weighted _ if @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the greatest common divisor with respect to the lattice ordering @xmath86 .",

    "there exists a unique decomposition of @xmath15 of the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are simple elements with @xmath98 such that ( provided @xmath99 ) for each @xmath100 , the pair @xmath101 is left - weighted .",
    "we call @xmath102 the classical ( left ) normal form of @xmath15 .",
    "the notion of left - weightedness for the usual garside structure is understood as follows .",
    "the _ starting set _ and the _ finishing set _ of a simple element @xmath103 are defined by @xmath104 @xmath105 respectively . in terms of crossings of braid diagrams , @xmath106 ( @xmath107 , respectively ) if and only if the strands numbered @xmath67 and @xmath108 at the beginning of @xmath15 ( at the end of @xmath15 , respectively ) do cross in @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite an ordered pair of two simple elements @xmath109 is left - weighted if and only if @xmath110 .",
    "thus , in terms of crossings the left - weightedness condition says that no crossing @xmath111 from @xmath112 can be moved to @xmath103 in such a way that @xmath113 is still simple .",

    ", generated by positive powers of all elements in the family @xmath115 and @xmath116 be the braid corresponding to the clockwise rotation of all strands by one notch .",
    "birman , ko and lee @xcite showed that @xmath117 is another garside structure for the braid group .",
    "in particular the monoid @xmath118 induces a lattice order on @xmath2 , which we denote by @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) and the dual positive divisors of  @xmath121 ( with respect to @xmath119 ) form a finite generating set called the set of _ dual simple elements_. the pair @xmath117 is called the _ dual garside structure _ of the braid group .",
    "the notion of left - weightedness is defined in the same way as in the classical case : an ordered pair of dual simple elements @xmath122 is left - weighted if @xmath123 , here @xmath124 is the greatest common divisor with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "then we have , analogous to the classical left normal form , the _ dual left normal form_.    @xcite let @xmath94 .",

    "we call @xmath129 the dual ( left ) normal form of @xmath15 .    the dual simple elements can be more easily described and studied viewing them as mapping classes of the punctured disk @xmath65 . to this end",
    "we isotope the latter to the following model : @xmath130 we denote by @xmath131 the circle @xmath132 along which the punctures are placed . for simplicity",
    "the @xmath67th puncture will be denoted by @xmath67 instead of @xmath79 and for @xmath133 , we also denote by @xmath134 the arc of @xmath131 described by the move of the puncture @xmath67 clockwise along @xmath131 until the position @xmath135 .",
    "the generator @xmath77 is then a clockwise ( left - handed ) half dehn twist along the chord segment connecting the punctures @xmath67 and @xmath135 .",
    "let us now describe the set of dual simple elements .",
    "for @xmath136 , take @xmath137 punctures @xmath138 in this order when running along @xmath131 clockwise from @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
    "all braid words obtained as a concatenation of @xmath141 consecutive letters taken from the sequence @xmath142 in this order , up to cyclic permutation , represent the same braid @xmath143 .",
    "geometrically , as a mapping class of @xmath65 , the braid @xmath143 corresponds to a clockwise rotation by one notch of a neighborhood of the convex polygon in @xmath65 whose vertices are the punctures @xmath138 . due to this correspondence , we call such a braid @xmath143 a _ ( convex ) polygon _ and we will often confuse @xmath143 with the corresponding convex polygon in @xmath65 .",
    "for example , the dual garside element @xmath121 corresponds to the polygon which is the convex hull of all punctures . notice that when @xmath144 , the polygon is degenerated and corresponds to a single letter @xmath145 ( a single half dehn twist about the chord segment joining the two punctures ) .",
    "two polygons which are disjoint commute ; their respective actions on the disk are totally independent from each other .",
    "any dual simple element can be written in a unique manner as a product of disjoint polygons ( up to permutation of the factors ) @xcite .",
    "the notion of left - weightedness in the dual context can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath77 and @xmath146 be two generators .",
    "we say that @xmath146 _ obstructs _ @xmath77 and we write @xmath147 if @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the relation @xmath150 is not symmetric : @xmath147 does not imply @xmath151 .    [",
    "prop : left - weighted]@xcite let @xmath152 and @xmath153 be dual simple elements expressed as products of disjoint polygons .",
    "then the pair @xmath122 is left - weighted if and only if for any two vertices @xmath67 and @xmath135 of a polygon among @xmath154 , there exists a polygon among @xmath155 having two vertices @xmath156 and @xmath157 such that @xmath147 .",
    "this section originated in trying to exploit a result by lee and song which can be stated as follows :    @xcite if non - trivial , the kernel of the burau representation @xmath9 is a pseudo - anosov subgroup of @xmath158 .",
    "pseudo - anosov braids are mapping classes of the punctured disk @xmath65 represented by pseudo - anosov homeomorphisms , those which are neither a root of the full twist @xmath159 , nor permute a family of disjoint isotopy classes of simple closed curves in @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "an important result relating pseudo - anosov braids and garside theory asserts that any pseudo - anosov braid admits a power which is conjugate to a rigid braid @xcite , meaning that it is cyclically left - weighted : the ordered pair formed by the last and the first factor is left - weighted .",
    "moreover , up to taking further power we may assume this rigid braid to have even infimum .",
    "observe now that the burau matrix @xmath160 is the homothety of ratio @xmath161 : @xmath162 .",
    "it follows that the burau representation @xmath9 is not faithful if and only if there exists a rigid pseudo - anosov positive braid with infimum 0 whose burau matrix is an homothety of ratio @xmath163 for some positive integer @xmath164 .",
    "this motivates to explore some conditions under which the burau matrix is not an homothety .",

    "however in order to use this procedure in an inductive way and hence determine the whole of the dual normal form , the simply - nestedness assumption is crucial because property * ( c ) * just concerns the last factor @xmath573 so it does not guarantee that @xmath667 also has property * ( c)*. moreover as we saw , simply - nestedness is often much easier to recognize as property * ( c)*.    [ remark : propc ] a statement similar to the first part of theorem [ theorem : main_dual ] concerning the dual infimum and the minimal degree of the entries of the burau matrix , although it sounds quite reasonable , can not be deduced from our proof .",
    "indeed , the simply - nestedness assumption as well as the property * ( c ) * do not control intersections of noodles and arc segments will smallest wall - crossing labeling at all .",
    "for the same argument to work , we need the following analogue of property * ( c ) * :    ( c@xmath668 ) : :    let @xmath572",
    ". express    @xmath573 as a product of disjoint polygons :    @xmath574 .",

    "this makes a good contrast with the case of the lkb representations @xcite ; in that context one can apply key techniques of treating arc segments with the largest crossing labeling ( bigelow s key lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.1 ) ) to arc segments with the smallest crossing labeling as well .",
    "we just need to be careful about the assertion ( ii ) ( see remark [ remark : propc ] ) . to prove ( ii ) , we notice that all dual simple elements are represented as a connected polygon . this observation and an argument similar to lemma",
    "[ lemma : snimplies_c ] shows any 3-braid has property * ( c@xmath668)*.            let @xmath671 be the abelianization map , given by @xmath672 . since @xmath673 , if @xmath674 then @xmath675 . by combining this simple constraints",
