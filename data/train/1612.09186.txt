    "the higgs boson was discovered in 2012 by the atlas and cms collaborations at lhc  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the physics of the higgs boson interactions with other particles and with itself has been elucidated by few qualitative models , suitable to illustrate it to undergraduate students and to the grand public .",
    "a very popular model is the one formulated by david miller of university college london ( for which he won a champagne bottle awarded by the uk science minister william waldegrave intended for those who would be able to explain the higgs mechanism to the people )  @xcite .    since then a number of analogies were proposed to help people understand the higgs mechanism , most of which relies on the analogy of the higgs field with a viscous medium in which particles move slower than in air .",
    "such an analogy provides an effective way to illustrate how the interaction of a field with a massless particle gives rise to the mass of the latter : the mass appears as a reduction of the particle speed in _ vacuum _ , where the _ vacuum _ is a state with the minimum possible energy .",
    "these analogies do not face the problem of explaining the nature of the vacuum state that does not correspond to an empty space , but to a space filled with a certain amount of higgs field for which the higgs auto - interaction potential attains its minimum .",
    "they also fail in explaining what it means to _ observe _ a higgs boson .    in our recent works we provided two alternative models addressing these problems .",
    "one is a video ( in italian )  @xcite illustrating the interaction of massless particles , represented by steel balls , with the higgs field represented by magnets . in this video a massless particle interacts with the field that _ limits _ its ability to move in a given region of space , depending on the nature of the particle ( i.e. , on the coupling constant between the field and the particle ) .",
    "another resource is a paper  @xcite illustrating the higgs mechanism using a completely classical formalism , suitable to be understood by most of teachers ( even those who does not know about quantum mechanics ) and at least part of the students .",
    "none of the models cited before is suitable for the realisation of a _",
    "hands on _ installation , as it may be required by scientific museums or institutions . in this paper",
    "we propose a model that is very attractive because it permits to realise an installation in which people can immerse themselves to directly experiment the interaction with a higgs boson . in the following sections we illustrate the installation and its usage as a pedagogical tool to address all the aspects of the interaction of the higgs field with massless particles , namely :    1 .",
    "contrary to familiar fields , when the higgs potential @xmath0 attains its minimum value @xmath1 in a volume there is , in fact , a certain amount of field @xmath2 that , however , is unobservable ; 2 .",
    "if the amount of the higgs field @xmath3 inside this volume is reduced or increased , the potential changes and the higgs field becomes observable ( this is an optional feature ) ; 3 .   a massless particle in",
    "such a field moves with a speed lower than the speed of light , just because it interacts with the higgs field ; 4 .",
    "the interaction of matter fields with the higgs field may led to the observation of a higgs boson .",
    "section  [ sec : setup ] describes the setup of the installation ; section  [ sec : method ] shows how to use the installation to illustrate the properties of the higgs boson .",
    "a very simple setup can be realised with a children ball pool , such as in fig .  [",
    "fig : ballpool ] .",
    "the walls of the pool must be opaque and the pool must be partially filled .",
    "it should stay at a height such that people looking from outside can not see its content .",
    "optionally , the pool must sit on a scale through which its weight can be measured .",
    "the sensitivity of the scale must be good enough to make it possible to appreciate a variation in weight due to the removal of few balls and must indicate zero in normal conditions .",
    "a children ball pool is a good model of a universe filled by a certain amount of higgs field ( image is a courtesy of tutto gonfiabili  play wily).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the pool represents the universe , while the balls represent the higgs field permeating the universe .",
    "the balls have a nice feature in this context : while acting almost as a fluid when treated as a whole , they are discrete objects . such a feature provides a very good support to explain the dual nature of quantum fields that behave , at the same time , as waves and particles .",
    "the setup is easy to be realised , cost effective and clean ( no liquids required ) .",
    "in this section we illustrate the various aspects of the higgs physics using our model of the universe , represented by the pool , and of the higgs field , represented by the balls .",
    "the first feature of the higgs field , listed in section  [ sec : introduction ] , namely the fact that the higgs field is unobservable when it attains its minimum energy , is shown looking at the pool from outside .",
    "the balls can not be seen and a _ scientist _ can only conclude that the universe , represented by the pool , is empty . however",
    ", we do know that such a universe is not empty : there is , actually , some _ field _ inside .",
    "the only way to try to detect this field is to interact with it .      in the higgs mechanism ,",
    "the field @xmath4 interacts with itself with a potential like    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "a distinctive feature of this potential is that for @xmath8 , @xmath9 does not attain its minimum value . instead",
    ", the minimum value for the potential is reached for    @xmath10    if one defines the _ vacuum _ state as the lowest possible energy state , the vacuum state does not coincide with an empty space , like it happens with more familiar fields .",
    "for example , the energy density @xmath11 of the electromagnetic field is    @xmath12    @xmath13 and @xmath14 being , respectively , the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath15 the dielectric constant of the vacuum and @xmath16 its magnetic permittivity .",
    "this implies that @xmath17 when @xmath18 , i.e. , the energy attains its minimum in the absence of all the fields .",
    "hence the vacuum state coincides with the empty state .    with the introduction of a higgs field ,",
    "the vacuum state is no more the empty state , but a state in which the higgs potential reaches its minimum , i.e. , a state in which there exists some field    @xmath19    if , in a region , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , the energy of the state increases .",
    "since the higgs field interacts with itself , in these conditions the residual higgs field @xmath22 defined as    @xmath23    produces enough new field to bring the region back to the equilibrium .",
    "removing or adding some extra field to our setup means removing or adding balls from it .",
    "this changes the weight of the pool and the effect can be read on the scale .",
    "when the scale is not at zero the system is not in equilibrium .",
    "correspondingly one can _ see _ the removed balls or the added ones from outside , concluding that there is something else in the region out of the vacuum .",
    "the only way to return the system to the stable condition is to bring it back to the original condition of zero weight . here",
    ", the weight of the system plays the role of the higgs potential .",
    "when such a potential is null the system is at its equilibrium and this happens when there is a specific amount of field inside the volume , that can not however be detected .",
    "the detection of some extra higgs field implies a non vanishing potential .",
    "this analogy is only partial , in fact . while the higgs potential always increases , irrespective of the sign of @xmath22 , the weight of the system either increases or decreases .",
    "however , the scale can be configured such that it only shows the absolute value of the difference in weight and this recover the analogy .",
    "moreover , the higgs field would spontaneously recover the equilibrium , if the field content changes , while in this case this does not happen .    as outlined above ,",
    "this part of the exhibit can optionally be ignored , being also rather difficult to control , especially when the device is not supervised by experts .",
    "this feature makes the setup very flexible and suitable for different environmental conditions .",
    "the mass of the fermions in the standard model ( sm ) arise from the yukawa interaction of otherwise massless particles with the higgs field at its minimum value  @xcite .",
    "the coupling of a fermion , represented by @xmath24 , with a field @xmath3 can be written , in the sm lagrangian , as    @xmath25    @xmath26 being the coupling constant between the fermion and the higgs field , and the bar represents the conjugation of the field . in the same model",
    "the mass of a particle would enter as a term like    @xmath27    manifestly , if @xmath28 , the coupling between the fermion and the average value of the higgs field in vacuum gives rise to dynamically generated mass terms in the lagrangian .",
    "a massless particle is represented , in this analogy , by a person moving in the space around our universe .",
    "those people can move at their own speed without limitations .",
    "if the same person walks inside the universe filled with the higgs field , its speed is reduced , as if it acquires inertial mass .",
    "the reduction of its speed depends on the fact that now the _ particle _ interacts with the _ field_.    different persons may interact differently with the balls , as different particles do with the higgs field , leading to particles with different mass .",
    "a muon differs from an electron just because its interaction with the higgs field is stronger than that of the electron .",
    "a tall person may move faster than a short boy in the ball filled universe , because the degree of interaction of the latter is higher .    experimenting the effect by themselves",
    "makes it extremely clear one of the most difficult concepts to understand in higgs physics : how the interaction with a field can lead to a mass for an otherwise massless particle .    in summary , people observing a person ( representing a massless particle ) walking inside the pool can only measure the speed of it ( the particle ) to be lower than that would be outside the _",
    "universe_.    the conclusion is that _ particles _ that move at the same speed in an empty universe , move with different speeds in a universe filled with some higgs field at its lowest energy state , that however appears as empty since such a field is not observable .",
    "the speed of each particle depends on the coupling between the higgs field and the particle : the stronger the coupling , the lower the speed , hence the higher the inertial mass .",
    "when a person moves inside the pool , people can only see part of its body .",
    "they do not see the _ field _ : it is still not possible to observe any higgs boson in these conditions .    in order to observe a higgs boson in an experiment what we need to do",
    "is to provide enough energy to the field such that it can _ materialise _ into a particle that eventually will disappear decaying into a pair of other particles . as a matter of fact",
    ", higgs bosons can be produced at lhc because the energy of the collision between protons turns into the mass of the higgs boson plus other particles .",
    "in other words , one need to transfer enough energy to the vacuum to produce real observable higgs bosons .    in order to provide enough energy to the vacuum field",
    ", one may run inside the pool at enough speed . in this way the kinetic energy of the _ particle _ interacting with the higgs field can be gained by such",
    "a field and few balls can scatter high enough to become visible out of the walls of the pool .",
    "soon after the balls return to their original position , however the bottom line will be that people observing a certain region of the universe in which particles are injected with enough energy may lead to the production of new particles , otherwise unobservable : these new particles can exist only for a very limited amount of time and are what physicists call the higgs bosons .",
    "it is important that a public installation conveys the right messages and does not become merely a toy to play with . to this purpose",
    ", the shape and colour of the pool can be adjusted such that the attention of the visitors is maintained on the installation topic .",
    "for example , if the pool is narrow and long , such that visitors can only walk along its length , part of the playful aspect vanishes or , at least , diminishes .",
    "a similar effect can be obtained using monochromatic balls ( and possibly of a neutral colour ) , in contrast with those found in playgrounds and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ballpool ] .",
    "we described a possible installation that can be used in scientific exhibits to explain the physics of the higgs boson to the grand public . such an installation is easy to realise and cost effective and potentially addresses all the features of the higgs field interaction with other particles .",
    "it is aimed at all ages and versatile enough to modulate the level of the analogy according to the audience background .",
    "i am indebted with the director of exhibits and media studio at the s. francisco s exploratorium thomas rockwell for his precious suggestions and his advices .",
