    "to compute the angular momentum it is essential to note that the lagrangian has @xmath41 symmetry and the super angular momentum is a @xmath41 conserved current . under the infinitesimal transformation , we find the following transformation for the fields & & t= ^1 y-^2 x , x= ^0 y-^2 t , y=-^0 x+^1 t , + & & a_0= 12(^0+^1 ) a_1 - 12 ^ 2 a_0,a_1= 12(-^0+^1 ) a_0 + 12 ^ 2 a_1,a_2=0 .",

    "one may write this result as @xmath123 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "also for the electromagnetic part one finds _ em=12 .",
    "the total super angular momentum then will be @xmath124 .",
    "as we mentioned in section 2 the black hole solutions in this paper have two free parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in order to check that the entropy , angular momentum and mass satisfy the differential form of the first law of the thermodynamics for black holes we need to know every parameter in terms of these two free parameters .",
    "the area of the horizon is equal to @xmath125 .",
    "the temperature of the black holes is given by @xmath126 , and the angular velocity can be read from the metric and it is equal to @xmath127 . for all solutions in this paper we must check the following relations [ dform ] - t_h - _ h = 0,- t_h - _ h = 0 .",
    "as an example ( we have checked the above relations for every solution , the computations are very lengthy in most cases ) for uncharged solutions in four derivative case we find & & - t_h - _ h = -12=0 , + & & - t_h - _ h = -14 = 0 , where we have used the equation of motion @xmath128 in this case . as another example for uncharged solution in the six derivative case",
    "we find & & - t_h - _ h = + & & - = 0 , + & & - t_h - _ h = + & & = 0 , where we have used the equation of motion again .    for charged solutions , for example consider the m - charged solution at four derivative case , we find & & - t_h - _ h = -=0 , + & & - t_h - _ h = = 0 . in all cases in this paper , by using the equations of motion one can show that the equations ( [ dform ] ) are correct .",
