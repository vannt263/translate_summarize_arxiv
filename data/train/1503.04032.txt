    "winds in offshore storms transmit energy to the ocean surface , creating waves .",
    "once the waves leave the storm area they become organised into two - dimensional regular wave trains , in the form of a regular profile that propagates practically unchanged in a fixed direction .",
    "these periodic travelling waves are called ` swell ' in oceanography .",
    "their shape is influenced by the underlying currents .",
    "the most significant currents on areas of the continental shelf and in many coastal inlets are the tidal currents @xcite .",
    "these alternating horizontal movements of water are created by the gravitational pull of the moon , and to a lesser degree , the sun , on the earth s surface , being associated with the rise and fall of the tide : the current associated with a rising water level , called the flood , is directed towards the shore , while the current associated with a receding water level , called the ebb , is directed back out to sea .",
    "flows of constant vorticity with a flat free surface provide adequate descriptions of pure tidal currents , cf .",
    "the discussion in @xcite , positive constant vorticity @xmath0 being appropriate for the modelling of the ebb current and negative constant vorticity @xmath1 for the flood current .",
    "a spectacular example of wave - current interaction is the columbia river entrance , made by appreciable tidal currents one of the most hazardous navigational regions in the world since wave heights can easily be doubled in just a few hours @xcite . at this location , tidal velocities in excess of 2 m",
    "/ s are encountered and in winter wave heights in excess of 6 m , up to 14 - 15 m , are common , cf .",
    "note that moderate tidal currents reach speeds of up to 0.7 m / s , cf .",
    "@xcite , while tidal currents with speeds of 5.5 m / s are encountered in between the scottish mainland and the orkney islands , in the pentland firth  see the data provided in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we provide accurate approximations for the interaction of waves with underlying currents of constant vorticity in the absence of flow - reversal ; for theoretical studies and numerical simulations of wave - current interactions with flow - reversal we refer to @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "let us specify that in a flow where both waves and currents are present , given velocity measurements at one point , the ` current ' is defined as the average velocity , and the periodic components that vary around this average are ascribed to the wave motion .",
    "since irrotational flows do not present flow - reversals as the underlying current must be uniform , one of our main purposes will be to highlight the effects of vorticity on the surface wave profile .",
    "this problem is of great practical relevance since the detection of non - uniform underlying currents from the surface wave pattern is particularly important to anticipate and avoid hazardous conditions , where possible .",
    "in addition to the wave profile , we will also provide approximations for the velocity profile and the pressure throughout the fluid .",
    "not only is there a strong interplay of these flow characteristics that is very useful in qualitative studies  see @xcite , but in practice information on the state of the sea surface is often gathered from subsurface pressure and/or velocity measurements , cf . the discussions in @xcite .",
    "let us point out the following counter - intuitive fact : periodic travelling waves that propagate at the surface of water with a flat bed in a flow of constant vorticity must be symmetric if no flow - reversal occurs and if the wave profile is monotone between successive crests and troughs , cf .",
    "this means that an underlying non - uniform current of constant vorticity does not break the symmetry of irrotational wave trains , so that the manifestation of vorticity on the surface wave pattern must take subtler forms .",
    "the fact that even when both the wave motion and the underlying current of constant vorticity are known with accuracy , their interaction produces a significantly different effect from that obtained by simply adding the effect of the waves and the currents considered separately , cf .",
    "the discussions in @xcite , shows the importance of dealing simultaneously with these two flow components .",
    "linear theory ( see the discussion in @xcite ) provides the dispersion relation @xmath2 for the wave speed @xmath3 , expressed in terms of the surface current speed @xmath4 in a flow of constant vorticity @xmath5 in water of mean depth @xmath6 ; here @xmath7 is the frequency of a wave with wavelength @xmath8 .",
    "note that ( [ dis ] ) permits us to understand the effect of vorticity on the propagation speed of waves of small amplitude ( that are realistically described by linear theory ) .",
    "for example , from the point of view of a fixed observer noticing right - propagating waves that interact with a current with vanishing surface speed ( a setting corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , from ( [ dis ] ) we infer that the propagation speed is @xmath11 irrespective of the sign of @xmath5 . in this setting the underlying current beneath the flat free surface @xmath12 and above the bed @xmath13",
    "is given by @xmath14 , so that @xmath0 corresponds to an adverse current since everywhere beneath the surface the current velocity opposes the direction of wave propagation , @xmath1 corresponds to a favourable current ( the current velocity points everywhere beneath the surface in the direction of wave propagation ) , while the irrotational case @xmath15 is characterized by the absence of an underlying current .",
    "a simple analysis of ( [ disv ] ) confirms that @xmath16 for every @xmath17 .",
    "this means that favourable currents enhance the wave speed , while adverse currents reduce it .",
    "in contrast to this analysis of the wave speed , the first - order approximation that is pursued within the framework of linear theory is not conclusive in regard to the effect of underlying currents on the wave profiles : at first order , periodic travelling waves in flows of constant vorticity are sinusoidal ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , nonlinear effects have to be accounted for and higher - order approximations are needed .",
    "we present in this paper an approach that provides the second and third order asymptotic expansion of waves of small amplitude , expressed in terms of a suitable amplitude parameter @xmath18 . following this procedure",
    ", we can readily obtain other characteristics of the water flow , such as the velocity field and the pressure beneath the wave .",
    "the knowledge of accurate approximations for these wave characteristics allows us to compare the results with those for irrotational flows . in the last part of the work we illustrate these flow characteristics for several different types of wave - current interactions .",
    "laboratory experiments and numerical simulations for irrotational waves are discussed in @xcite , while this type of studies for wave - current interactions in flows of constant vorticity were pursued in @xcite .",
    "the results presented below permit a more detailed analysis and numerical simulation .",
    "in this paper we discuss two dimensional , periodic travelling waves with constant vorticity .",
    "we assume that the water is incompressible and inviscid , over a flat bed and acted upon by gravity @xmath19 . in what follows",
    "we make no shallowness or small amplitude approximation . in order to avoid extended revision",
    "we refer to the recent works @xcite for the mathematical formulation of the problem . in this section",
    "we make only a brief review of the problem , in order to provide sufficient terminology for the fundamental boundary value problem ( bvp ) .",
    "we are studying two - dimensional waves travelling at constant speed @xmath3 .",
    "this means that in a two - dimensional frame moving with the constant speed @xmath3 , the flow pattern  and , in particular , the shape of the surface of the fluid  does not change over time .",
    "these assumptions , see @xcite , allow the definitions of the free surface profile by @xmath20 and the flat bed by @xmath21 with @xmath22 , for the normalized wavelength @xmath23 .    without loss of generality ,",
    "the assumption that the waves oscillate around the flat free surface @xmath12 is made , i.e. , @xmath24    we denote the velocity field of the flow by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 where @xmath27    in this paper we follow the assumption made in @xcite , that there are no flow - reversals , which is formulated as the condition @xmath28    we denote the pressure in the fluid by @xmath29 , with @xmath30 . neglecting the effects of surface tension",
    " a hypothesis that is appropriate for waves of moderate and large amplitude ( see the discussion in @xcite )  we impose that the water pressure is constant on @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the atmospheric pressure .",
    "let us recall the following definitions :    * the vorticity of the flow is defined by @xmath34 which for the rest of the paper we will assume constant . * the relative mass flux is the relative horizontal velocity of the flow , with reference to the moving frame at speed @xmath3 .",

    "the stream function @xmath39 is defined as the unique solution of the differential equations @xmath40 subject to @xmath41 * in @xcite it was proven that the expression @xmath42 equals a constant @xmath43 throughout @xmath38 .",
    "the constant @xmath44 is called the hydraulic head .",

    "we define the curve that represents the laminar flows @xmath68 with @xmath54 and @xmath69 given by and , respectively .    restricting our attention to rotational flows with constant vorticity @xmath5 , in @xcite it was proven that near this curve , as the parameter @xmath70 varies , there are generally no genuine waves , except at critical values @xmath71 determined by the dispersion relation . near this bifurcating laminar flow @xmath72 , we have two solution curves : one laminar solution curve @xmath73 , where @xmath70 and @xmath54 are related by , and one non - laminar solution curve @xmath74 such that @xmath75 unless @xmath76 , see figure [ fig : bifurc ] .      using the above argument we observe that the variation of the parameter @xmath54 ( which is the hydraulic head of the flow ) about the uniquely determined value @xmath77 implies an approximation of non - laminar flows , in the following sense .",
