    "both reaction and diffusion  limited cluster  cluster aggregation  ( dlca ) have been successfully used to understand the dynamics of colloidal aggregation  @xcite .",
    "these models predict well both the structure of aggregates and the growth behavior in dilute particle suspensions as long as the dynamics is dominated by brownian diffusion .",
    "as the growth of the aggregates proceeds the sedimentation of clusters due to gravitation becomes more pronounced altering the growth mechanism and cluster structure .",
    "this was recently observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study dynamic scaling in one - dimensional cluster ",
    "cluster aggregation in the presence of a competition between diffusion and drift .",
    "we show that the dynamics at long times is dominated by the aggregation process which by itself would lead to the fastest growth .",
    "the conventional mean - field theory gives the correct dynamic exponent for the field dominated case but fails when diffusion dominates .",
    "the mean - field theory also predicts that the scaling function of the cluster size distribution in the diffusive ( driven ) case would drastically change when @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) changes sign .",
    "such a transition is observed for the diffusive case but not for the driven one .",
    "the dynamic phase diagram shows four different regions depending on the relative rates of the diffusion and drift .",

    "the field  driven cluster  cluster aggregation  ( fdca ) model is defined on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions , for simplicity .",
    "initially particles are distributed randomly on a lattice of @xmath6 sites up to a concentration  @xmath7 .",
    "sites connected via nearest neighbor occupancy are identified as belonging to the same cluster .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of a cluster of size @xmath0 takes the form @xmath8 where @xmath4 is the diffusion exponent and @xmath9 a non - negative constant .",
    "the clusters are also driven into one direction with a size dependent drift velocity @xmath10 , which defines the field exponent  @xmath5 .    in simulations a cluster",
    "is selected randomly and the time is incremented by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of clusters at time  @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the maximum mobility of any of the clusters in the system at that time .",
    "the cluster mobility is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are non - negative constants . the choice @xmath18 gives normal dlca .",
    "the cluster is moved only if @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an uniformly distributed random number in the interval  @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the step is taken along ( against ) the field with probability @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "if after the move two clusters are in contact , they are irreversibly aggregated together . note that time is increased for each attempted move .",
    "figure  [ spacetimeplot ] shows an example of the dynamics when either the diffusion ( fig .",
    "1a ) or the drift ( fig .",
    "1  b ) dominates the large time aggregation behavior .",
    "the diffusion and field exponents are chosen in such a way that at large times the largest clusters are the most mobile ones . in the latter subfigure ,",
    "notice the clear breaking of the reflection symmetry in the cluster dynamics as the drift begins to dominate .",
    "similar behavior is visible in the early - time dynamics of the diffusion - dominated case .",
    "before considering any specific aggregation rules let us first represent the well - known mean - field approach . we want to compare different dynamical processes in order to find the dominating aggregation mechanisms .",
    "denote the number of clusters of size @xmath0 per site at time @xmath13 by @xmath26 and the mean cluster size by @xmath27 .",
    "the mean - field description of irreversible aggregation which neglects spatial correlations is given by smoluchowski s equation  @xcite @xmath28 where the reaction kernel @xmath29 describes the rate at which clusters of size @xmath30 and @xmath31 aggregate .",
    "it is assumed to be a homogeneous function @xmath32 with @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "kernels are classified by @xmath35  @xcite : @xmath36 ( class  i ) , @xmath37 ( class  ii ) , and @xmath38 ( class  iii ) .",
    "independent of the class the solution scales for mass conserving systems as @xmath39 . in class",
    "i the aggregation is dominated by the collisions of large clusters with large ones whereas the dominant contribution in class  iii comes from the reactions between large and small clusters . in class",
    "ii these two processes are equally important .",
    "the class  iii processes can be identified from the form of the scaling function since in classes  i and ii @xmath40 but in class  iii @xmath41 as @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on the scaling function , on the polydispersity exponent @xmath43 , and on the dynamic exponent @xmath44 describing the growth of the mean cluster size : @xmath45 .",
    "the polydispersity exponent in the mean - field  ( mf ) is easily found to be @xmath46 in class  i. predicting it for class  ii processes is still a challenge  @xcite .",
    "however , for all non - gelling systems , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath47 , the dynamic exponent is related to the homogeneity exponent  @xmath48 as @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the upper critical dimension , above which the mean - field theory is exact , may be calculated once the reaction kernel is known  @xcite .",
    "consider for a moment the aggregation of clusters of fractal dimension @xmath50 in @xmath51 dimensions .",
    "for a dlca kernel @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) the mean - field theory is not exact in any finite dimension  @xcite but the deviations are negligible already in @xmath54  @xcite . in the driven case ,",
    "if diffusion and velocity fluctuations are neglected , clusters move ballistically .",
    "the collision probability of two clusters is proportional to the product of the mutual cross - section of the clusters and the velocity difference between clusters latexmath:[$k_v(i , j ) \\sim ( i^{1/d_f}+j^{1/d_f})^{d-1 }    system in @xmath51 dimensions has similar scaling properties as the diffusive one in @xmath56 dimensions and therefore the upper critical dimension is infinite for both .",
    "if both diffusion and drift are present the faster dynamics , as measured by the associated dynamic exponent , could be expected to dominate .",
    "this is verified by the simulation results , discussed in the next section .",
    "thus it is adequate to consider the two dynamic processes separately .",
    "for example , in one dimension the scaling properties of @xmath57 necessitate that @xmath58 together with @xmath59 for @xmath60 ( class  iii ) and @xmath61 for @xmath62 ( class  ii ) .",
    "thus the scaling function should drastically change as @xmath5 changes its sign .",
    "in one dimension the collision cross - section is independent of the clusters sizes .",
    "thus the above scaling analysis is directly applicable to the diffusion  limited case , too and there should be similar transition between the classes  iii and ii at @xmath63 .    in one dimension the scaling properties of the reaction kernels together with @xmath64 give the mean - field dynamic exponent in the diffusive and driven cases as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the strong fluctuations are responsible for the fact that the correct exponent is @xmath67 in the diffusive case  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic exponent may on the other hand be obtained more simply by considering the two length scales coming from the two dynamical processes : the diffusive length scale @xmath68 and the ballistic one @xmath69 .",
    "naturally the average cluster size is proportional to the dominant length scale , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath70 , which together with @xmath1 and @xmath2 results in @xmath67 and @xmath71 for the diffusion and drift dominated cases , respectively .",
    "the simulation results presented in section  [ simsec ] confirm these arguments .",
    "thus the smoluchowski  approach predicts the correct dynamic exponent for the driven case even in one dimension .",
    "if both diffusion and drift are present @xmath72 with the crossover at @xmath73 .",
    "the average cluster size at the crossover can be estimated by comparing the pairing time ( the time required for @xmath74 ) due to diffusion , @xmath75 , to that due to drift , @xmath76 . in the diffusive case the pairing time",
    "can be obtained by considering a random walk on coarse - grained system with the lattice constant set equal to the average cluster radius @xmath77  @xcite . in one dimension",
    "the cluster density on the lattice is @xmath78 where the volume @xmath79 .",
    "a cluster travels a distance of its own radius diffusively in time @xmath80 . as it takes on the average @xmath81 steps to pair up @xmath82 .    for driven clusters",
    "the variation in cluster velocities is the relevant parameter .",
    "therefore the pairing time is of order @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the standard deviation of the cluster velocities .",
    "it can be calculated from the velocity distribution @xmath85 which gives @xmath86 where @xmath87 and the approximation comes from replacing the sum by an integral .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath88 has to be determined numerically from simulations since calculating it would require the knowledge of the whole scaling function .",
    "the crossover takes place as @xmath89 which gives the average cluster size at the crossover as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the elementary particle radius .",
    "in simulations the system sizes range from @xmath92 to @xmath93 , the data are averaged over @xmath94 realizations , the concentration is usually at @xmath95 , and random initial conditions are used .",
    "neither the initial conditions nor the concentration has any effect on the asymptotic dynamic scaling properties as was verified by simulations .",
    "the timescale is fixed by setting @xmath96 for dlca and @xmath97 for fdca if not otherwise mentioned .",
    "the mean cluster size is calculated using both the number ( @xmath98 ) and weight averages @xmath99 @xmath100 both averages scale similarly and the number average is used in all the figures following . in order to ensure that the scaling regime is reached the dynamic exponent is calculated using the method of consecutive slopes  @xcite .",

    "we first consider purely diffusive dynamics , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain an excellent scaling for the cluster size distribution using the scaling form @xmath105 ( fig .",

    "horizontal lines show the crossover region @xmath117 where the scaling functions show typical class  ii behavior .",
    "the data for various @xmath4-values have been shifted in the vertical direction to make the figure clearer . ]",
    "the decay of the scaling function near @xmath118 depends on the sign of @xmath4 and there is a transition from class  iii ( @xmath119 ) to class  ii ( @xmath120 ) at @xmath121 in accordance with the mean - field analysis .",
    "however , the transition between the algebraic and non - algebraic decay of the scaling function is plagued by strong crossover effects .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ crossover ] where the scaling functions are presented for several values of the diffusion exponent .",
    "the crossover behavior is in excellent agreement with the mean - field theory according to which the kernels in classes  i and iii show typical class  ii behavior for intermediate @xmath20 values : @xmath122  @xcite . in our case",
    "the @xmath123 and the intermediate @xmath20 region is presented by horizontal lines in figure  [ crossover ] .",
    "the dynamics for @xmath124 can be solved exactly to establish that the dlca belongs to class  ii at @xmath125 .",
    "the exact result for the cluster size distribution is @xmath126 $ ] , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 is the modified bessel function  @xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) , where the constant @xmath131 depends on the average used to calculate the mean cluster size .",
    "as the scaling function decays faster than a power - law in class  iii the polydispersity exponent @xmath43 is well - defined only for @xmath132 .",
    "although the statistics is insufficient for a direct determination of the relationship @xmath133 the fits to the scaling function show that @xmath43 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath4 so that @xmath134 at about @xmath135 .",
    "the scaling theory states that for class ii @xmath136 for @xmath137 and @xmath138 with the scaling relation @xmath139  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath140 can be obtained more accurately from simulations than @xmath43 .",
    "a careful analysis of the data shows that @xmath140 is roughly a constant @xmath141 for @xmath142 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath140 can not be independent of @xmath4 since necessarily @xmath143 which diverges when @xmath144 . by approximating",
    "@xmath145 near @xmath63 leads to @xmath146 , which is zero at @xmath147 ( compare with the actual result above ) .",
    "this approximation is consistent with the exact value @xmath148  @xcite .",
    "note that the point @xmath149 at which the cluster size distribution changes from a non - monotonic function to a monotonic one is not the same as the transition point between the classes @xmath121 . in the literature",
    "it has been argued that in two and three dimensions @xmath125 is negative but these arguments rely on the fact the cluster size distribution would change to a non - monotonic function at the same point  @xcite .",
    "as this is clearly not the case in one dimension it is highly probable that @xmath121 in higher dimensions , too .",
    "the corresponding fdca - simulations are done using @xmath150 .",
    "figure  [ zdelta ] shows also for this case the dynamic exponent as a function of the field exponent together with the mean - field prediction .",
    "the agreement is excellent except for @xmath151 for which values the asymptotic regime has not been reached .",
    "@xmath152 is a special point : all the clusters move with the same velocity but the algorithm itself causes intrinsic diffusion resulting in the standard random walk value @xmath153 .    as in the purely diffusive case the cluster size distribution exhibits scale invariance @xmath154 but now with a bell - shaped scaling function @xmath155 as @xmath42 ( see figure  [ scaldlca ] ) .",
    "thus fdca belongs to class  iii .",
    "no indication of belonging to the class ii is seen in the range @xmath156 in contradiction with the mean - field theory .",
    "the absence of the transition shows that although the mean - field analysis gives the correct dynamic exponent it fails in the case of the scaling function .",
    "this is not surprising since the spatial fluctuations expected to be important in low dimensions are completely neglected in equation  .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath157 the probability for collisions of large clusters with large ones is relatively small compared to large - small collisions since the decisive factor is the velocity difference , not the high mobility of large ones .",
    "the case @xmath158 of fdca is interestingly enough related to a driven diffusive ising system ( dds ) .",
    "the low temperature coarsening in an ising chain with conserved magnetization and subject to a small external force can be mapped almost exactly to the diffusion of domains with a size - independent diffusion constant  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the mapping is not quite one - to - one is reflected in the behavior of dimers in the dds .",
    "they perform long - range hopping which results in another characteristic length scale in the problem  @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the domain length distribution does not obey the usual dynamic scaling for small cluster sizes like it does in the fdca , although the domain size distributions are otherwise practically the same  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ diffusion_and_field ] shows the crossover from the diffusion dominated growth to the field dominated one for three different concentrations . estimating the unknown parameter @xmath159 in equation   using the scaling function of the diffusion limited aggregation for @xmath160 gives @xmath161 .",
    "equation   gives the crossover sizes @xmath162 , and @xmath163 for concentrations @xmath164 , and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "these values agree reasonably well with the simulations as can be seen from figure  [ diffusion_and_field ] .",
    "the results of our study are summarized in figure  [ phasediag ] which shows the dynamic phase diagram with four different regions .",
    "the aggregation is dominated by the field or the diffusion . at the phase boundary",
    "@xmath73 the two processes give the same dynamic exponent .",
    "it is unclear which one of the aggregation mechanisms determines the asymptotic scaling behavior at the boundary .",
    "the diffusive phase is split into two subphases according to the dominating aggregation mechanism .",
    "the dynamics may also be so fast that the systems gels in a finite time .",
    "although this paper has considered @xmath166 we can also discuss the @xmath167 case . here",
    ", complications arise because the clusters may have a fractal structure . for the field - driven aggregation the clusters",
    "will in any case become anisotropic with a preferred orientation in the field direction .",
    "we believe both of these complications affect only the phase boundaries of the dynamic phase diagram but leave its general structure invariant if temporal scaling can be assumed . one particular issue is the existence of a field - dominated phase with the scaling function belonging to class ii .",
    "the comparison of the mean - field approach and simulations in higher dimensions is left for a forthcoming study .",
    "the exact location of the phase boundaries would be an interesting problem also when it comes to applications to experiments .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied one - dimensional driven diffusive cluster  cluster aggregation .",
    "we have shown how the scaling function depends on the cluster mobilities with diffusive or ballistic dynamics , or both .",
    "for the field dominated case the dynamic exponent can be obtained from simple mean - field calculations , which together with the simulation results may be used to obtain the phase boundaries in the dynamic phase diagram .",
    "this shows four different phases in the aggregation depending on the relative strength of the diffusion and the field ."
