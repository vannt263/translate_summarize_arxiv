    "_ in situ _ , surface - sensitive scattering techniques , such as reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) and x - ray scattering at the so - called `` anti - bragg '' position@xcite , yield direct information about surface morphology during growth , and have been applied to virtually all methods of thin film growth  such as electrodeposition@xcite , molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) , chemical vapor deposition ( cvd)@xcite , and pulsed laser deposition ( pld)@xcite .",
    "their principal advantages , compared to scan - probe microscopies such as atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , are their time resolution and the ease with which they can be incorporated into growth systems as qualitative , _ in situ _ probes .",
    "for example in homoepitaxy , growth is classified as `` step - flow''(sf ) , `` layer - by - layer''(lbl ) or `` three - dimensional '' based , respectively , on whether the specular reflectivity remains constant , oscillates , or decreases monotonically with increasing film thickness .",
    "an additional advantage of x - ray scattering is the accuracy with which precise calculations of scattered intensity can be performed .",
    "increasingly , this has been exploited@xcite to extract quantitative information about the surface morphology , namely the layer coverages as a function of time @xmath2 , during growth .",
    "this analysis , however , requires a specific model of the morphological evolution of the film .",
    "figure [ fig : pent_raw ] shows x - ray reflectivity ( xrr ) and afm data obtained from four pentacene films , grown in immediate succession on a single sio@xmath0 substrate under nominally identical conditions ( substrate temperature 48@xmath3c ) , and serves to illustrate the main subject of this work : how accurately can the height probability distribution , which may be obtained directly from the afm data in fig .",
    "[ fig : pent_raw]b - e , be extracted from fits to the x - ray data in fig .",
    "[ fig : pent_raw]a ?",
    "in addition , how does the choice of model used for such analysis affect the simulated morphology ?",
    "( color online ) ( a ) xrr data obtained near the pentacene anti - bragg position during pentacene deposition on sio@xmath0 .",
    "data are shown for four separate films grown to thickness of ( @xmath4 ) 0.34 ml , ( @xmath5 ) 1.4 ml , ( @xmath6 ) 2.5 ml , and ( @xmath7 ) 4.4 ml , performed in immediate succession on the same substrate under the same conditions .",

    "all images are 20 @xmath8m@xmath620@xmath8 m . ]",
    "the models described here are necessary , in part , because x - ray intensity measurements such as those in figure  [ fig : pent_raw]a are performed at only one point in reciprocal space .",
    "as has recently been demonstrated@xcite , measuring multiple points along the reflectivity curve can reduce or potentially obviate the requirement for such models",
    ". however , such measurements are not always possible or compatible with a particular system or experiment .",
    "further , with notable exceptions@xcite , such enhanced measurements are often used not to replace the use of growth models , but to limit uncertainties associated with comparing measurements to calculations .",
    "finally , although this manuscript deals with the limited problem of determining the surface morphology of a growing film , the models described here also concern the broader challenge of understanding , in detail , how microscopic , kinetic parameters of a system determine its morphology . clearly , comparing the simulated morphologies of these models to real systems is a critical , first step in validating them for deeper , more general use .",
    "one motivation for this work is to evaluate a particular model ( the `` modified cohen '' model , see section  [ sect : models ] below ) we recently developed to measure the time - dependent growth rate of hyperthermally - deposited organic thin films@xcite .",
    "this time - dependence arises from differences between the sticking probabilities of deposited molecules on the bare substrate and the growing film .",
    "because this sticking probability depends strongly on the substrate , a quartz crystal monitor is an inappropriate measure of growth rate .",
    "this phenomena has been observed in other systems : in metal - organic based gan growth on sapphire , both growth rate acceleration@xcite and deceleration@xcite have been observed using _ in situ_measurements of ga k@xmath9 x - ray fluorescence . for organic molecules containing only light elements ,",
    "this method is not possible .",
    "growth rate acceleration may also be determined using ex situ microscopy ( see section [ sect : dip ] below ) , but this approach requires several samples per growth condition , and can be severely complicated by the presence of de - wetting , a common phenomena in organic thin films@xcite .",
    "accurate determination of growth rates and growth rate acceleration from time - resolved xrr data relies directly on quantitative analysis as described above , and thus on the accuracy of the growth simulation .",
    "in prior studies , we validated our model by comparing both the total film thickness and rms roughnesses of thin films measured by afm to those predicted by best - fit simulations . here , we provide a complete description of this model , and also address the specific problem of measuring growth rate acceleration .",
    "we proceed , in section  [ sect : xray ] , by reviewing xrr intensity calculations relevant for thin film growth . to elucidate how different features of the film and substrate influence the character of oscillations , we explicitly derive x - ray scattering parameters in the approximation where each layer consists of uniform density slabs .",
    "additional insight is gained by considering the case of continuous , or step - flow growth , although it is not directly relevant for the particular systems described here . in section  [",
    "sect : models ] , we provide detailed descriptions of three distinct deterministic , rate - equation models of thin film growth . finally , in section  [ sect : results ] , we compare these models to two particular systems .",
    "the first of these , pentacene / sio@xmath0 ( represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pent_raw ] ) , has well - known structural and morphological evolution and , under these growth conditions ( see section [ sect : pent ] ) , does not exhibit growth rate acceleration .",
    "four films of varying film thickness are grown under identical conditions .",
    "height distributions of these films , measured with ex situ afm , are then compared in detail with those deduced using fits to reflectivity data at the anti - bragg position .",
    "the second system described in this paper , diindenoperylene ( dip)/sio@xmath0 , exhibits growth rate acceleration , which we model as a difference in molecular sticking probability between the substrate and deposited film .",
    "we find that two of the models , including that in ref .",
    ", accurately describe the degree of acceleration .",
    "experiments were conducted at the g3 station at the cornell higher energy synchrotron source ( chess ) in a custom - designed , ultrahigh vacuum chamber with a base pressure of  5@xmath610@xmath10 mbar described previously @xcite .",
    "growth was performed on 300 nm - thick sio@xmath0 thermal oxide films on si(001 ) wafers , using a hyperthermal molecular source .",
    "the deposition energy , measured using time - of - flight mass spectrometry , was approximately 2.5 ev for pentacene and 4.2 ev for dip .",
    "synthetic w / b@xmath11c multilayer monochromators set the beam energy to 9.75  kev with @xmath12% .",
    "the unattenuated flux at the sample position was approximately 5x10@xmath13 photons - s@xmath14-mm@xmath15 . in order to avoid radiation damage ,",
    "the beam was attenuated by a factor of 10 or more using multiple layers of aluminum foil at the upstream end of the hutch . an avalanche photodiode detector (",
    "oxford danfysik , oxford , uk ) scintillator counter was used for measuring the scattered x - ray intensity .",
    "afm was conducted ex situ in tapping mode using a digital instruments 3100 dimension microscope ( santa barbara , ca ) .",
    "the computational simplicity of x - ray scattering results from the fact that , far from a bragg peak or from the critical angle for total external reflection , the born approximation ( also referred to as the single scattering or kinematic approximation ) may be used @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the scattered intensity @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 , where the scattering amplitude @xmath18 is the fourier transform of the electron density : @xmath19 for the particular case of _ in situ_data collected during thin film growth at a position @xmath20 in reciprocal space , and with the assumption that the substrate does not vary during deposition , this may be simplified to  @xcite , @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the fractional coverage of layer @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the lattice parameter of the film normal to the surface . typically , experiments are conducted at the anti - bragg position , corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both defined as pure real , there are only two unknown scattering parameters , @xmath28 and the ratio @xmath29 .",

    "this model is particularly suitable for amorphous substrates such as sio@xmath0 , but also valid for si substrates with a thin sio@xmath0 native oxide@xcite , and thick , thermal sio@xmath0 layers covered by a self - assembled monolayer@xcite or an interfacial water layer @xcite .    to help visualize the scattering intensity arising from eq.[eq : xray2 ] near the anti - bragg position for organic thin films , it is conceptually useful to further approximate the film as composed of uniform density slabs of height @xmath24 and density @xmath41 .",
    "this approximation explicitly eliminates bragg peaks , but is nevertheless reasonably accurate near the anti - bragg position whenever this geometry probes a length scale , @xmath42 , that is large compared to interatomic distances .",

    "the dashed curves correspond to ideal lbl growth , while the dotted curves correspond to ideal sf growth .",

    "for the case of dip / sio@xmath0 , it is additionally required that the sticking coefficient of incident molecular species vary with coverage of the first layer .",
    "first , we present two modifications to the so - called distributed model of ref .  [ ] that widen its range of applicability and connect , within the limits of the mean - field approach , to well - defined physical quantities .",
    "this modified cohen ( mc ) model , ( depicted schematically in fig .",

    "[ fig : dip_xray]c , in both the afm data and the models , is that the rms roughness at film thickness @xmath140 is _ smaller _ than that at @xmath141 .",

    "the growth rate acceleration for the mc and fz models yields 112% and 122% , respectively , in excellent agreement with the result from afm .",
    "the bk model , which we reiterate is not intended to model growth rate acceleration accurately , gives a more modest growth rate acceleration of 56% .",
    "we conclude that , at least for systems exhibiting relatively smooth growth at early times , the mc and fz models provide an accurate means of determining growth rate acceleration .",
    "in this paper , we have provided the first comparative study of the problem of obtaining surface morphology from _ in situ _ , time resolved xrr data .",
    "we described three mean - field models of thin film growth , along with detailed examples of their application to quantitative analysis of xrr data obtained at the anti - bragg position during growth .",
    "two sets of organic thin films were grown using hyperthermal deposition , pentacene / sio@xmath0 and dip / sio@xmath0 . for each system , _ in situ_xrr data was obtained during growth of four films , grown to different thicknesses , under nominally identical conditions .",
    "the xrr data were fit to each of the the three models , resulting in detailed simulations of the time - dependent morphology of each film .",
    "finally , these simulated morphologies were directly compared with afm data from each of the four films to critically evaluate the quality of each simulation .",
    "we find , first , that all of the models provide good descriptions of both the xrr data and , at early times , the surface morphology of an evolving film .",
    "this is significant , since the evolution of layer coverages incorporates the rate of interlayer transport , which controls the onset of roughness .",
    "second , we find that the model which fits a particular data set best statistically , i.e. which gives the lowest value of @xmath1 , does not necessarily provide the most faithful reproduction of the true surface morphology .",
    "the models we used all incorporate analogous parameters determining interlayer transport as a function of layer coverage , but these parameters represent fine distinctions regarding intralayer atomistic kinetics and morphology .",
    "the fact that better fits do not correlate to improved agreement with the true surface morphology suggest that our measurements are not sensitive to such fine distinctions .",
    "we understand this lack of sensitivity to fine detail as resulting from the limited amount of information contained in the intensity at a single point @xmath143 on the reflectivity curve . as stated above , _ in situ_studies performed at multiple @xmath143 values",
    "have been demonstrated , both in angular dispersive@xcite and energy dispersive modes using white beam@xcite .",
    "however , these techniques both suffer from poorer time resolution than in single point mode . in angular dispersive mode , this results from the requirement of moving the sample and/or sample chamber during the growth . in energy - dispersive mode ,",
    "the time resolution is limited by detector dynamic range@xcite , and the fact that the signal is so much stronger near bragg peaks compared to the anti - bragg position . a variation to this approach",
    "would be to combine an energy - dispersive detector with a finite bandwidth beam , for example 10% , obtained with wide bandwidth multilayers@xcite in conjunction with a bend magnet or wiggler .",
    "using a 10@xmath1440.5 kev beam , an energy resolution of 0.2 kev would result in approximately 4 - 5 independent points on the reflectivity curve being obtained simultaneously , resulting in significantly more information with minimal loss in time resolution .",
    "concerning the determination of growth rate : in the case of pentacene / sio@xmath0 , which exhibits an abrupt roughening transition near 2 ml , different models obtain values for the total growth rate that vary by as much as 10% . for dip / sio@xmath0 ,",
    "which exhibit extended lbl oscillations , we find that fits of xrr data to the mc and fz models both correctly extract the degree of growth rate acceleration .",
    "a key feature of the mc and fz models is that they both incorporate measurable quantities , such as the layer step - edge density and the critical coverage for next - layer nucleation , as fit parameters .",
    "future work will aim to test whether these parameters , rather than only the layer coverages , can be extracted from xrr data during growth .",
    "for example , we will investigate how accurately the critical coverage parameter , @xmath145 extracted from fits of xrr data to the fz model , corresponds to independent measurements of @xmath145 .",
    "we believe that such work will contribute significantly to the technologically important challenge of understanding , and ultimately controlling , physical and experimental factors determining surface morphology in thin films .",
