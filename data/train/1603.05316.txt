    "figure [ fig_scheme]b shows a prototypical system to be investigated in this study , where there exists a variable stiffness mechanism between the axial and torsional directions . given a generalized interaction of particles under a power law , we can express inter - particle forces as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the axial and torsional force , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the axial and torsional displacements , respectively . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the power - law factors that determine the force relationship ( e.g. , @xmath111 for a linear relationship ) . based on this , the equations of motion of this system can be expressed as follows : @xmath12^p   -k_{a , ( \\theta_{n}-\\theta_{n-1})}[\\delta_0+u_{n}-u_{n+1}]^p , \\nonumber\\\\          i\\ddot{\\theta}_{n } = & k_{\\theta , ( u_{n-1}-u_{n})}[\\alpha_0+\\theta_{n-1}-\\theta_{n}]^s   -k_{\\theta , ( u_{n}-u_{n-1})}[\\alpha_0+\\theta_{n}-\\theta_{n+1}]^s.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the inertia of each particle in axial and tangential directions , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the axial and torsional displacements under static equilibrium , respectively . note that the two equations above are coupled since the axial stiffness @xmath17 is affected by torsional displacements @xmath18 , while the torsional stiffness @xmath19 is affected by axial displacements @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig_psd ] , the coupled pc with a variable stiffness mechanism is capable of controlling transmission efficiency of the primary channel s signals in the frequency domain between the higher and lower cut - off frequencies ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) . when we excite this system with a frequency in this domain , the transmission efficiency through the primary channel can be altered in relation to the control signal applied to the system .     and wave transmission @xmath91 .",
    "the system is excited with a frequency that resides in @xmath93 , and the parameters used are @xmath80 , @xmath123 1,@xmath124 .",

    "the dashed vertical line corresponds to zero control input .",
    "transmission in this case is still possible .",

    "thus , transmission amplitude above this line corresponds to amplification .",
    "( b ) change of system s characteristic curves as we vary @xmath126 and 3 .",
    "the inset shows the magnified view of the curves near the zero transmission efficiency.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    figure [ fig_at]a shows an example of the at effect when we use @xmath80 , @xmath40 , and @xmath124 .",
    "x_-axis denotes the control force relative to the primary wave s force amplitude , while the _ y_-axis represents the transmission efficiency in the primary channel , also relative to the primary wave s amplitude . to obtain this curve , the normalized amplitude of output signal @xmath91",
    "is calculated with varying the control input from @xmath127 to 1 with 100 steps . in fig .",
    "[ fig_at]a , we find that the transmission can be blocked by imposing the control input @xmath128 ( see the vertical solid line ) .",
    "this corresponds to _ off _ status , and this phenomenon is consistent with what we found in previous sections .",
    "as we change the control input from this _ off _ state , the transmission efficiency of the primary channel gradually increases .",
    "this corresponds to the _ on _ state of the at .",
    "interestingly , we note that at zero control input , we still have a portion of mechanical waves transmitted through the system ( vertical dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_at]a ) . in the narrow region between this zero control input and the off states ( i.e. , the region between the two vertical lines ) ,",
    "the increase of control signal towards the negative direction ( i.e. , @xmath79 phase difference between primary and control waves ) reduces the efficiency of the primary channel s output .",
    "this is in contrast to the increasing trend of the transmission efficiency described in the previous paragraph .",
    "farther past this zone towards the negative _ x_-axis , the increase of the control wave s magnitude results in the enhancement of the wave transmission in the primary channel .    the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_at]a is similar to the characteristic curve of conventional bipolar junction transistor ( bjt ) @xcite . while the current @xmath129 from the collector ( @xmath130 ) to emitter ( @xmath131 ) is controlled by the electric potential @xmath132 ( voltage difference between base and emitter ) in the electrical transistor , the proposed at system deals with the control @xmath72 ( acoustic counter part of @xmath132 ) and the force output @xmath91 ( acoustic counter part of @xmath129 ) .",
    "that is , we can control the wave output by choosing the operating point on this characteristic curve in a way similar to the electrical transistor .",
    "however , the main difference of the characteristic curve of the at compared with the electrical one is that the control must have @xmath133 to turn the at off completely ( again , it transmits the wave with zero control input as indicated with grey dotted line in fig . [ fig_at]a ) .",
    "lastly , we show that the characteristic curve can be altered by employing different sets of design parameters .",
    "while there exists a variety of choices in terms of the design parameters as discussed in the previous section , we present a simple example in fig .",
    "[ fig_at]b , when we vary @xmath134 and 3 .",

    "[ fig_at]b ) .",
    "the slope of the curves also changes as we adopt different @xmath56 .",
    "this is plausible , since @xmath56 determines how much the dynamics in the control channel affects the wave transmission in the primary channel .",
    "thus , we observe a steeper curve as we introduce a higher @xmath56 .    in this section",
    ", we numerically demonstrated that the pc system investigated in this study is capable of manipulating the primary channel s transmission efficiency through the control wave , which corresponds to the _ switching _ function of conventional transistors .",
    "another key feature of such conventional transistors is an amplification function , which enables manipulating a large - amplitude output signal using a small - amplitude control signal .",
    "the system proposed in this study meets this requirement in certain regimes .",
    "for instance , the slanted lines in figs .",
    "[ fig_at]a and [ fig_at]b show the lines that denote the same magnitude between @xmath63 and @xmath137 .",
    "we observe that the system in fig .",
    "[ fig_at]a does not meet this amplification requirement , while the ones in fig .",
    "[ fig_at]b successfully produce output waves amplitude larger than that of the control wave .",
    "thus , we numerically verify that the pc system equipped with a variable stiffness mechanism can be potentially exploited to be used as a mechanical counterpart of transistor systems .",
    "in this study we proposed a coupled phononic crystal ( pc ) with a variable stiffness mechanism and investigated its wave dynamics via analytical and numerical approaches .",
    "the focus was placed on the mixing effect of mechanical waves propagating along primary and control channels .",
    "we verified that this wave mixing effect enables not only the control over the transmission efficiency of propagating waves , but also selective transmission of specific wave modes and eventually wave modulation effect . to the further extent",
    ", we showed the feasibility of realizing acoustic transistors , which fulfill both switching and amplification functionalities , using the proposed phononic system .",
    "this article proposed a number of possibilities within the study of pcs and can serve as a guide for several other avenues for future study .",
    "some of these potential future directions include the role of nonlinearity and the study of the additional structures that are made possible due to nonlinearity , such as traveling wave and breather solutions  @xcite .",
    "importantly , it should be mentioned that relevant mechanisms may be considerably richer in higher dimensional settings , where the corresponding dispersion relation may enable intriguing possibilities ( including a dependence on the direction or angle of propagation ) . moreover , the interplay of nonlinearity with dimensionality may be of interest , as the existence properties of nonlinear states relevant to the present setting may be drastically different in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the extension to non - homogeneous systems would make a natural future direction .",
    "finally , the experimental verification of the system remains an open problem , but that is within reach given the state - of - art of pcs , which includes granular crystals @xcite , origami @xcite , and truss structures @xcite .",
