    "ferromagnetic multilayers have attracted much attention recently because of their applications in spintronics and high density magnetic recording devices . the present paper is concerned with magnetic relaxation in a ferromagnetic film ( @xmath1 ) imbedded between nonmagnetic metallic layers ( @xmath2 ) . in particular , we study the enhancement of the gilbert damping in @xmath3 sandwiches as compared with that of a single ferromagnetic film . the gilbert damping constant @xmath4",
    "is defined by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation of motion [ 1,2 ]    @xmath5 +    \\frac{g}{\\gamma^2 m_{s}^{2 } } \\left ( { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ m$}}}\\times\\frac{\\partial { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ m$ } } } }    { \\partial t } \\right ) \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is the magnetization vector , @xmath7 is the saturation magnetization , and @xmath8 is the effective field which is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gibbs free energy . the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath11 is a negative quantity @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spectroscopic splitting factor , and @xmath14 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the second term on the r. h. s. of eq.(1 ) represents the dissipative torque , the magnitude of which is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the llg equation describes well both the static and the dynamic properties of ultrathin ferromagnetic films and the @xmath3 sandwiches ( for a review see ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "the experimental and theoretical aspects of spin relaxation in multilayers are covered in ref.[4 ] .",
    "recent studies of the fmr linewidth for ultrathin films [ 5,6 ] show that the constant @xmath15 is enhanced when a nonmagnetic metal is deposited on the ferromagnetic film .",
    "this effect has been predicted in 1996 by berger [ 7 ] in his study of spin transfer between the polarized conduction electrons and the ferromagnetic film .",
    "berger shows that there is an enhanced electron - magnon scattering caused by isotropic @xmath0 exchange taking place at the @xmath16 interface .",
    "being a surface effect , the enhancement of the gilbert constant is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ferromagnetic film .",
    "this unique feature is observed in recent measurements of the additional fmr linewith on permalloy - normal metal sandwiches [ 8 ] , and on the double ferromagnetic layer structures as well [ 9 ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that already in 1987 a study of fmr linewidth showed an appreciable increase in the gilbert damping with decreasing thickness of the @xmath17 ultrathin films grown on bulk @xmath18 substrates [ 10 ] .",
    "a novel mechanism for additional gilbert damping in @xmath3 structures has been recently proposed by tserkovnyak et al.[11 ] .",
    "these authors calculate the spin current pumped through the @xmath19 contact by the precession of the magnetization vector @xmath20 .",
    "the theory is based on extending the scattering approach of parametric charge pumping by brouwer [ 12 ] to spin pumping .",
    "like the theory of berger [ 7 ] , the additional damping of ref.[11 ] scales inversely with the thickness of the ferromagnetic film indicating that only the @xmath16 interface is involved .",
    "however , the expression for excess @xmath15 , which we call @xmath21 , differs considerably from that of ref.[7 ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath22 vanishes with vanishing @xmath0 exchange splitting .",
    "an attractive feature of this theory is that it links @xmath21 to the transport properties of the interface . due to exchange polarization of the @xmath16 contact ,",
    "the reflection @xmath23 and transmission @xmath24 coefficients at the interface depend on the orientation of the conduction electron spin with respect to the magnetization direction of the ferromagnet .",
    "the formula for @xmath21 involves differences such as @xmath25 . interestingly ,",
    "similar quantities play a role in the theory of interlayer magnetic coupling by bruno [ 13 ] . for instance",
    ", the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) coupling [ 14 ] between two - dimensional layers can be obtained by calculating the interlayer coupling energy in terms of the reflection coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the layers .",
    "these coefficients are obtained by solving a simple problem of scattering by @xmath28-function potential . in the limit of weak exchange splitting ( compared to the fermi energy )",
    ", the derived interlayer coupling agrees with the rkky result of yafet [ 15 ] .",
    "these considerations prompt us to take another look at the theory of enhanced relaxation in multilayer .",
    "the fact that the rkky theory [ 13 ] involves transport properties at the interface similar to the spin pump theory of @xmath21 [ 11 ] suggests that a suitable generalization of rkky theory to time - dependent magnetization @xmath20 may unravel the needed dissipative torque of eq.(1 ) .",
    "we note that the standard approach to rkky coupling is to use a linear response theory [ 14,16 ] , and calculate the conduction electron spin density induced by the contact exchange potential . in applications to interlayer coupling between ferromagnetic layers with time - independent magnetization vectors , it is the static spin susceptibility of the electron gas which determined the coupling . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a response to a slowly varying time - dependent @xmath0 exchange potential .",
    "owing to the dissipative part of the spin susceptibility , the spin density induced by the precession of @xmath20 will have a component that is out of phase with @xmath20 .",
    "hence , such a component will have a time - dependence given by @xmath29 .",
    "the induced spin density has both local and nonlocal consequences for the dynamics of multilayers .",
    "first , let us focus on the local effect in the @xmath3 system .",
    "it is instructive to invoke the analogy to radiation damping of charged particle in classical electrodynamics [ 17 ] .",
    "thus , we put the dissipative torque of eq.(1 ) in correspondence with the radiation reaction force acting on the particle .",
    "the first term of eq.(1 ) corresponds to the external force . in view of this analogy ,",
    "we rewrite the dissipative torque in terms of a reaction field @xmath30    @xmath31 = -[{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ m$}}}\\times { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ h$}}}^{(d)}_{r}]\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 represents the dissipative part of @xmath30 . for the @xmath3 system shown in fig.1 .",
    ", we find a reaction field ( see appendix a )    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the @xmath0 exchange coupling constant , @xmath35 is of order of the lattice constant , and @xmath36 is the width of the ferromagnetic film .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is the spin density induced at the @xmath16 interface by the @xmath0 exchange interaction ( @xmath38 being the distance from the interface ) .",
    "the expression ( 3 ) is quite general in the sense that it can be used for both ballistic and diffusive cases . in the present paper",
    "we confine ourselves to the ballistic case and calculate the induced spin density using linear response theory [ 16 ] .    assuming slow precession of @xmath20 , we find two contributions : one that is proportional to @xmath20 with a coefficient given by the real part of the local spin susceptibility at zero frequency . if the spin susceptibility is anisotropic , this term leads to an anisotropic shift of the fmr frequency . for isotropic susceptibility ,",
    "the quantity on the r.h.s . of eq.(3 ) is a vector parallel to @xmath20 and the corresponding torque ( 2 ) vanishes .",
    "the second contribution to @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality is the frequency derivative of the imaginary part of the susceptibility taken at @xmath40 . like the real part ,",
    "this quantity is generally anisotropic . according to eq.(2 ) , it produces a dissipative torque leading to an anisotropic @xmath21 . explicit evaluation of this term for an isotropic noninteracting electron gas yields a formula for @xmath21 which compares favorably with the spin pump theory of tserkovnyak et al.[11 ] .",
    "the proposed formulation allows us to incorporate interactions between the electrons in the @xmath2 region .",
    "the generalized hartree - fock approximation shows that the @xmath41 dependent spin susceptibility of the interacting electron gas is enhanced compared to the free electron case [ 16 ] . using these results",
    ", we find that the part of @xmath42 that contributes to the fmr frequency shift is enhanced by the stoner factor @xmath43^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the screened intraatomic coulomb interaction and @xmath45 is the electron density of states , per atom , at the fermi level [ 16 ] . on the other hand , we find that @xmath21 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "the stoner enhancement is thought to be large in metals such as palladium and its alloys .",
    "recent results using multilayers with @xmath47 layers as a spacer show a significant enhancement of interface damping exhibiting a fourfold anisotropy in keeping with the present theory [ 18 ] .",
    "let us turn to the nonlocal consequences of the dynamically induced spin density .",
    "this is relevant in the case of two time - dependent magnetizations @xmath48 and @xmath49 separated by a nonmagnetic spacer .",
    "similar to the local effect , the magnetization @xmath48 at @xmath50 induces at the position @xmath51 of @xmath49 a spin density oscillation with both the in phase @xmath52 and the out of phase component @xmath53 .",
    "the interaction of the in - phase component with @xmath49 yields the standard interlayer rkky coupling [ 15 ] .",
    "the out of phase component leads to a dissipative interaction of the form @xmath54 . a similar form , with the indices @xmath55 and @xmath56 interchanged , follows by taking into account the spin density induced at @xmath50 by precession of @xmath49",
    ". such terms may be of importance in fmr studies involving dynamically coupled magnetic films .",
    "however , these topics are beyond the scope of the present investigation which focuses on dynamics of single ferromagnetic film in contact with nonmagnetic metal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we derive the spin density induced by a two - dimensional layer of precessing spins , and the corresponding reaction field .",
    "sec.iii focuses on the dissipative part of the reaction field , and the excess damping @xmath21 for an isotropic electron gas .",
    "an expression for @xmath21 in a free electron model is derived for @xmath3 structure with @xmath2 layers of both infinite and finite thickness .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath21 due to electron - electron interactions is considered within the generalized hartree - fock approximation .",
    "in sec.iv we establish a relation between the spin pumping theory of ref.[11 ] and our free electron result for @xmath21 . the role of spin",
    "sink in theories of gilbert damping is discussed in sec.v .",
    "the reaction field for the @xmath3 structure is derived in appendix a. the role of spin relaxation in the theory of @xmath21 is considered in appendix b.",
    "we consider a two - dimensional layer of aligned spins imbedded in normal metal . notice that a similar model was used by yafet [ 15 ] to calculate the interlayer coupling for time - independent magnetizations . here",
    "we take into account the time - dependence of the precessing magnetization .",
    "our task is to derive the conduction electron spin density induced by the @xmath0 exchange interaction taking place at the magnetic layer .",
    "the hamiltonian of the conduction electrons is    @xmath57    where @xmath58 represents the hamiltonian of the electrons in the absence of the ferromagnetic layer , and the second term is the @xmath0 exchange interaction with the layer .",
    "@xmath34 is the @xmath0 exchange coupling constant , @xmath59 is the classical spin at the location @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the spin density operator for the electrons in normal metal .    for a uniform precession of aligned spins , we have @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the volume of the unit cell .",
    "the second term of eq . ( 5 ) acts as a time - dependent perturbation that will be treated using the linear response theory [ 16 ] .",
    "thus , the expectation value of the @xmath64-component of the induced spin density is @xmath65    where @xmath66\\rangle\\ ] ] is the retarded spin correlation function ( susceptibility)[16 ] , @xmath67 being the unit step function .",
    "now , we evaluate the r.h.s . of eq.(7 ) assuming a slow precession .",
    "this approximation is valid as long as the precessional frequency is small compared to the relevant excitation frequencies of the conduction electrons .",
    "we note that the spin pump theory requires a similar condition to hold [ 11 , 12 ] .    performing the @xmath68-integration , and applying the commutation law for the convolution , eq.(7 )",
    "reads    @xmath69    for slow precession , we write    @xmath70    introducing this expansion into eq.(9 ) , we obtain with use of eq.(6 )    @xmath71}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath72    we note that the second term on the r.h.s . of eq.(11 ) follows by letting the derivative of the real part of the susceptibility with respect to @xmath73 equal to zero at @xmath74 .",
    "this is consistent with the reality condition implying that that the real part of the susceptibility is an even function of @xmath73 .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.(11 ) corresponds to the static rkky result of yafet [ 15 ] .",
    "the second term is the dynamic generalization of rkky for a slowly precessing magnetization .    for an infinite medium , the sheet sums in eq . (",
    "11 ) can be evaluated by invoking translational invariance and fourier transforming @xmath75 to @xmath76-space [ 13 ] .",
    "thus , we define a generic sum @xmath77\\chi_{\\mu\\nu}({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ q$}}},\\omega)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from which both terms of eq.(11 ) can be deduced .    to perform the @xmath78-integral on the r.h.s .",
    "of this equation , we set    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is confined to the sheet , and @xmath81 is perpendicular to the sheet .",

    "the external magnetic field of the fmr experiment is one source of this splitting . for a system of infinite size",
    ", this splitting establishes a lower cutoff on the wave vector @xmath78 . as shown below",
    ", this cutoff is essential to prevent the logarithmic divergence of eq.(21 ) . due to",
    "the spin splitting , the susceptibility develops some anisotropy . since transverse components of the reaction field ( 19 )",

    "performing first the integration over polar angle @xmath105 , we have @xmath106    introducing this result into eq.(25 ) , and converting the @xmath107-integral to @xmath108-integration , we obtain at @xmath109    @xmath110    the unit step function on the r.h.s . of this equation",
    "equals one for @xmath111 , and zero for @xmath112 where    @xmath113    thus , @xmath114 acts as a lower cutoff in the @xmath78-integral of @xmath115 .",
    "since @xmath116 , the upper cutoff is given by @xmath117 .",
    "we then get using eq.(27 )    @xmath118    introducing this result into eq.(21 ) , we obtain @xmath119    where we assumed a cubic lattice to write @xmath120 . strictly speaking ,",
    "@xmath21 in this equation is not a simple gilbert damping since its strength depends on the applied magnetic field , but it is a weak dependence .    when @xmath121 vanishes , @xmath21 exhibits a logarithmic divergence .",
    "this is due to the fact that precessing magnetization radiates into the @xmath2-region a very large number of electron - hole pairs of low energy .",
    "this is reminiscent of the infrared divergence in quantum electrodynamics where a large number of low energy photons is radiated . endowing the photon with a small mass cures this divergence [ 19 ] . in an analogous way",
    ", a nonzero spin splitting of the electron energy levels suppresses the number of low energy electron - hole pairs that are generated by the precessing magnetization .    for @xmath122",
    ", we have @xmath123 we see that it is the magnetic length @xmath124    which plays the role of @xmath125 in case of infinitely wide @xmath2 layers . taking @xmath126 gauss and putting @xmath127 , we obtain from eq.(32 ) @xmath128 . in real samples ,",
    "the @xmath2 layers are usually considerably thinner than this length .",
    "as shown in the next subsection , the relevant cutoff is then determined by the boundary conditions ( b.c . ) at the outer surfaces of the sandwich .",
    "it is interesting that spin relaxation of the conduction electrons can provide an effective gap and a finite cutoff length even in the limit of infinitely thick @xmath2 layers .",
    "as shown in appendix b , the resulting cutoff length is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the spin - relaxation time .",
    "the corresponding value of the effective gap is @xmath131 .",
    "the same quantity determines the linewidth of the electron paramagnetic resonance of conduction electrons [ 23 ] .",
    "its magnitude is presumably not negligible in comparison with the magnetic splitting @xmath132 .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic sheet imbedded between two @xmath2 layers each of thickness @xmath133 . strictly speaking , in a finite system",
    ", the translational invariance invoked in the evaluation of the sheet sum ( 13 ) is broken .",
    "this complicates the calculation of the induced spin density .",
    "nevertheless , a simplified approximate evaluation of @xmath134 can be carried out if @xmath135 . in this case , the translational invariance is restored locally since the boundary at @xmath136 plays a small role . the b.c . at @xmath137",
    "is taken in the form @xmath138 this condition follows from assuming that there is an infinite potential step at the normal metal - vacuum boundary .",
    "thus , the @xmath2-electron wave functions are forced to zero at the boundary and so is the magnetization density . applying this b.c.to eq.(18 ) , the finite-@xmath133 version of eq.(17 ) reads @xmath139    where @xmath140 , and @xmath141 since it is the lattice spacing which determines the highest value of @xmath142 . in view of this , eq.(21 ) is changed to @xmath143}\\ ] ] for noninteracting electrons without spin splitting , we have @xmath144 for @xmath145 , we use the definition of the euler constant @xmath146 to obtain    @xmath147    using eqs.(35 - 37 ) , we obtain    @xmath148    as expected , the boundary conditions in a finite slab imply a cutoff @xmath149 .",

    "this seems to contradict our eq.(43 ) .",
    "we attribute this disagreement to spin accumulation in the normal layers . since the spin - orbit coupling constant of @xmath170 is larger ( by a factor of 3 ) than that for @xmath47 ,",
    "the spin lattice relaxation rate in @xmath170 is an order of magnitude stronger than that in @xmath47 .",
    "as pointed out by tserkovnyak et al [ 11 ] , the spin accumulation takes place when the spin relaxation rate is small .",
    "the fact that experimental ration @xmath171 is less than 10 indicates that stoner enhancement in @xmath47 is not excluded .",
    "more convincing evidence of stoner enhancement in interface damping comes from recent fmr studies on @xmath172_{5}/14fe / gaas(001)$ ] + samples [ 18 ] . compared to a single layer structure ,",
    "these samples show a @xmath21 that is enhanced by a factor of four and exhibits a strong fourfold in - plane anisotropy .",
    "apparently , the presence of a second @xmath17 layer provides an efficient spin sink .",
    "thus @xmath21 is determined by the exchange enhanced susceptibility rather than the bottleneck due to a weak spin - lattice relaxation in the @xmath2-layers .",
    "we now digress , for a moment , to consider the enhancement of the fmr frequency shift due to interactions . applying eq.(40 ) to the static anisotropic susceptibility , and making the approximation ( 42 )",
    ", we have @xmath173 . using this result in eq.(19 ) , we see that the frequency shift for the interacting electrons is @xmath164 times that for the independent electrons .",
    "this prediction could be used , in conjunction with the data for the anisotropic @xmath21 to clarify experimentally the role of interactions in the fmr of multilayers .",
    "we now show that for free electrons there is a similarity between our formula ( 30 ) for @xmath21 and the spin - pumping theory of tserkovnyak et al .",

    "note , however , that the logarithmic terms do not match .",
    "if we consider an infinite system , and ignore the cutoff due to the magnetic length ( 32 ) , the gap @xmath97 vanishes , and eq.(30 ) becomes logarithmically divergent . on the other hand , eq.(57 )",
    "shows that there is an effective gap , @xmath213 corresponding to a finite cutoff @xmath214 .",
    "thus , the spin - pumping theory is infrared - divergence free . for real finite size systems ,",
    "this difference is only of academic interest since the cutoff produced by the boundary conditions , @xmath149 , yields a logarithmic term that is of the same order of magnitude as that in eq.(57 ) .",
    "the presence of an effective gap , @xmath213 , in the spin pumping theory is presumably linked to the fact that , in contrast to linear response theory , it is of infinite order in the coupling constant @xmath34 .",
    "this is seen in eq.(54 ) where @xmath215 is a nonlinear function of @xmath204 given in eq.(53 ) .",
    "this kind of nonlinearity is generic in the scattering approach to transport(see eq.(51 ) ) .",
    "in fact , bruno [ 13 ] derives an exact expression for the static rkky coupling that goes beyond the linear response result of yafet [ 15 ] .",
    "our numerical estimate of @xmath21 based on eq.(38 ) suggests that a substantial enhancement of the fmr linewidth , that is independent of the atomic number @xmath216 , should be observed in @xmath3 systems .",
    "in contrast , the data of mizukami et al.[8 ] on trilayers containing permalloy films show a strong dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath216 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath217 , which has the smallest @xmath216 of the @xmath2-metals studied there is a complete absence of a @xmath218-dependent @xmath21 .",
    "tserkovnyak et al .",
    "[ 11 ] propose that it is the spin accumulation in the @xmath2-layer that is responsible for such a suppression of the ferromagnetic relaxation in copper layer .",
    "note that the theory of spin - pumping assumes at the outset that the spin system in the @xmath2-layer is kept in thermal equilibrium during the precession .",
    "for that one needs an efficient spin - sink mechanism . the data of ref.[8 ] indicate that spin - lattice relaxation via spin - orbit coupling [ 21 ] provides the required spin sink .",
    "in fact , metals with larger @xmath216 exhibit generally larger measured values of @xmath21 .",
    "this trend is in agreement with the fact that the spin - lattice relaxation rate scales as @xmath219 [ 22 ] .",
    "also the theory of @xmath21 , presented in sec.iii , assumes that the electron spins in the @xmath2-layers are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this can be established either by the spin - lattice relaxation in the bulk , or by surface relaxation .",
    "one way to include these effects into the reaction field of eq.(3 ) is to calculate the quantity @xmath220 using the bloch equation with diffusion [ 23 ] .",
    "this equation is to be solved with the b.c . that allows the electron spin to be flipped upon collision with the surface .",
    "such b.c . has been proposed by dyson [ 23 ] . in terms of the spin density @xmath221",
    "this so called `` evaporation '' b.c .",
    "reads @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the probability of spin flip to take place upon the reflection from the boundary , and @xmath224 is the mean - free path in the bulk .",
    "due to surface irregularities and paramagnetic surface impurities , the probability @xmath223 can be large enough to provide the necessary spin sink even for layers with small bulk disorder .",
    "alternatively , the spin density and the reaction field can be obtained from the time - dependent @xmath225 matrix kinetic equations driven by precessing magnetization of the ferromagnet [ 24 ] .",
    "such an approach is inspired by the work of kambersk [ 25 ] on intrinsic damping due to spin - orbit coupling in bulk ferromagnets .",
    "this work invokes the idea of a `` breathing fermi surface '' : the chemical potential varies in response to the time - dependent perturbation .",
    "however , the distribution of the electrons does not respond instantaneously to the perturbation .",
    "there is a time - lag characterized by a relaxation time @xmath226 . in ref.[18 ] we apply this idea to the case of dynamic interlayer exchange coupling . in this case",
    "it is the spacer electrons which are affected by the spin - dependent potential at the interfaces , and the time variation of this potential is due to the precession of the ferromagnetic moment .",
    "thus , the relevant relaxation time is the transverse spin - relaxation time @xmath227 . the resulting effective damping field , is like eq.(20 ) , proportional to @xmath228 implying gilbert damping .",
    "however , in distinction from eq.(20 ) , it is also proportional to @xmath227 .",
    "this brings us to the question : is there a system to which the ballistic theory of the present paper is applicable ?",
    "we believe that the double - layer structure studied in ref.[9 ] is a good example of such a system . here",
    ", the precessing layer @xmath229 deposits spin current into the @xmath2-spacer and the second layer @xmath230 acts as an absorber of the transverse component of the spin current - thus providing an effective spin sink .",
    "detailed analysis of this mechanism has been presented in beautiful papers by stiles and zangwill [ 26,27 ] .",
    "these authors show that there is an oscillatory , power law , decay of the transmitted transverse - spin current that is caused by cancellations due to a distribution of precessional frequencies , and the rotation of the spin of the incoming spin upon reflection .",
    "consequently , almost complete cancellation of the transverse spin takes place after propagation into the ferromagnet by a few lattice constants .",
    "this finding also supports our assumption that the excitation of transverse components of @xmath231 , via @xmath0 exchange , is confined to the @xmath232 interface layer(see appendix a ) .",
    "research by b.h . is supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ( nserc ) and the canadian institute for advanced research ( ciar ) .",

    "we consider a trilayer shown in fig.1 . , and derive the reaction field from the torque equation @xmath233}={{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ t$}}}(t)\\ ] ]    where @xmath234 is the net magnetic moment of the ferromagnetic film , and @xmath235 is the torque due to the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "since only interface regions contribute to this torque ( see refs.[13 ] and [ 27 ] ) , we pick a magnetic atom in the plane @xmath236 , and consider the local magnetic field @xmath237 acting on its magnetic moment @xmath238 . using eq.(5 ) , the expectation value of the @xmath0 exchange energy of this atom is @xmath239 . if we write this quantity as @xmath240 , where @xmath241 , the local magnetic field is    @xmath242    for a square film of area @xmath243 , the number of interface atoms is @xmath244 . thus , using eq.(a2 )",

    "similar approach has been used to deduce the effective field in ultrathin layers in the presence of interfaces ( see eq.(1.6 ) in ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "to include spin relaxation into the theory of @xmath21 , we start from eq.(22 ) and replace the infinitesimal quantity @xmath247 by @xmath248 , where @xmath130 is the spin - relaxation time .",
    "thus , the electron - hole pairs with flipped spin are assumed to relax with a frequency @xmath249 .",
    "similar assumption has been made in the theory of magnon relaxation via @xmath0 interaction [ 28 ] .",
    "moreover , we neglect the splitting @xmath97 . making these changes in eqs.(22)-(24 ) , we obtain @xmath250 where @xmath251    expanding the integrand to order @xmath73 , the @xmath105-integration yields @xmath252}\\ ] ] where @xmath253 . using eq.(b3 )",
