    "the measure - valued _ fleming - viot diffusion processes _ were first introduced by fleming and viot @xcite and have become a cornerstone of mathematical population genetics in the last decades .",
    "it is a model which describes the evolution ( forward in time ) of the genetic composition of a large population .",
    "each individual is characterized by a _ genetic type _ which is a point in a type - space @xmath5 .",
    "the fleming - viot process is a markov process @xmath6 on @xmath7 for which we interpret @xmath8 as the proportion of the population at time @xmath9 which carries a genetic type belonging to a borel set @xmath10 of types .",
    "in particular , the number of ( different ) types at time @xmath9 is equal to the number of atoms of @xmath11 with the convention that the number of types is infinite if @xmath11 has absolutely continuous part .",
    "fleming - viot superprocesses can be defined through their infinitesimal generators @xmath12 acting on smooth test - functions where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the generator for a markov process in @xmath5 which represents the effect of mutations . here",
    "@xmath15 is the dirac measure at @xmath16 .",
    "it is well known that the fleming - viot superprocess arises as the scaling limit of a moran - type model for the evolution of a finite discrete population of fixed size if the reproduction mechanism is such that no individual gives birth to a positive proportion of the population in a small number of generations . for a detailed description of fleming - viot processes and discussions of variations",
    "we refer to the overview article of ethier and kurtz @xcite and to etheridge s lecture notes @xcite .",
    "the first summand of the generator reflects the genetic resampling mechanism whereas the second summand represents the effect of mutations .",
    "several choices for @xmath14 have appeared in the literature . in the present work",
    "we shall work in the setting of the _ infinite site model _ where each mutation creates a new type never seen before . without loss of generality",
    "let the type space be @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "then the following choice of @xmath14 gives an example of an infinite site model with mutations : @xmath18 for some @xmath19 .",
    "the choice of the uniform measure @xmath20 is arbitrary ( we could choose the new type according to any distribution that has a density with respect to the lebesgue measure ) , all that matters is that the newly created type @xmath21 is different from all other types . with @xmath14 as in  ( [ e : iam mutation operator ] ) , mutations arrive at rate @xmath22 and create a new type picked at random from @xmath5 according to the uniform measure , therefore the corresponding process is sometimes called the fleming - viot process with neutral mutations .",
    "let us briefly recall two classical facts concerning the infinite types fleming - viot process described above ( for a more complete picture we refer to the monograph of etheridge @xcite ) for the uniform initial condition @xmath23 :    * if there is no mutation , then , for all @xmath1 fixed , the number of types is almost surely finite . *",
    "if the mutation parameter @xmath22 is strictly positive , then , for all @xmath1 fixed , the number of types is infinite almost surely .",
    "a beautiful complement to ( i ) and ( ii ) was found by schmuland for exceptional times that are not fixed in advance :    [ schmu ] @xmath24    schmuland s proof of the dichotomy is based on analytic arguments involving the capacity of finite dimensional subspaces of the infinite dimensional state - space . in section [ sec : schmuland ] we reprove schmuland s theorem via excursion theory . in the series of articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , bertoin and le gall introduced and started the study of _ @xmath25-fleming - viot processes",
    "_ , a class of stochastic processes which naturally extends the class of standard fleming - viot processes .",
    "these processes are completely characterized by a finite measure @xmath25 on @xmath26 $ ] and a generator @xmath14 .",
    "similarly to the standard fleming - viot process , these processes can be defined through their infinitesimal generator @xmath27 and the sites of atoms are again called types . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the generator formulation only appeared implicitly in @xcite and is explained in more details in birkner et al .",
    "@xcite and for @xmath14 as in it can be found in birkner et al .",
    "the dynamics of a generalized fleming - viot process @xmath6 are as follows : at rate @xmath29 a point @xmath30 is sampled at time @xmath1 according to the probability measure @xmath31 and a point - mass @xmath21 is added at position @xmath30 while scaling the rest of the measure by @xmath32 to keep the total mass at 1 .",
    "the second term of is the same mutation operator as in . for a detailed description of @xmath25-fleming - viot processes and discussions of variations",
    "we refer to the overview article of blath and birkner @xcite .    in the following we are going to focus only on the choice @xmath33 , the beta distribution with density @xmath34 for @xmath351,2[$ ] , and mutation operator @xmath14 as in  .",
    "the corresponding @xmath25-fleming - viot process @xmath36 is called beta - fleming - viot process or @xmath37-fleming - viot process and several results have been established in recent years .",
    "the @xmath37-fleming - viot processes converge weakly to the standard fleming - viot process as @xmath4 tends to @xmath38 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a @xmath25-fleming - viot process with @xmath28 is related to measure - valued branching processes in the spirit of perkin s disintegration theorem precisely if @xmath25 is a beta distribution ( this relation is recalled and extended in section  [ sec : transfer ] below ) .",
    "if we chose @xmath351,2[$ ] and @xmath23 uniform on @xmath26 $ ] , then we find the same properties ( i ) and ( ii ) for the one - dimensional marginals @xmath11 unchanged with respect to the classical case , .",
    "in fact , for a general @xmath25-fleming - viot process , ( i ) is equivalent to the requirement that the associated @xmath25-coalescent comes down from infinity ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "here is our main result : contrary to schmuland s result , @xmath37-fleming - viot processes with @xmath351,2[$ ] and @xmath39 never have exceptional times :    [ t : main ] let @xmath36 be an @xmath37-fleming - viot superprocess with mutation rate @xmath39 and parameter @xmath351,2[.$ ] if @xmath23 is uniform , then @xmath40 for any @xmath39 .",
    "one can get a first rough understanding of why this should be true by the following heuristic : kingman s coalescent comes down from infinity at speed @xmath41 , i.e. if @xmath42 is the number of blocks at time @xmath9 then @xmath43 almost surely when @xmath44 .",
    "it is known that ( see @xcite or more recently @xcite ) the process @xmath45 has the same law as the process of the number of atoms of the fleming - viot process . for a beta - coalescent with parameter @xmath46 we have @xmath47 almost surely as @xmath48 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) ) . therefore kingman s coalescent comes down from infinity much quicker than beta - coaelscents .",
    "since the speed at which the generalized fleming - viot processes looses types roughly corresponds to the speed at which the dual coalescent comes down from infinity , it is possible that @xmath37-fleming - viot processes do not loose types fast enough , and hence there are no exceptional times at which the number of types is finite .",
    "to prove theorem [ t : main ] we construct two auxiliary objects : a particular measure - valued branching process and a corresponding pitman - yor type representation .",
    "those will be used in section [ 111 ] to relate the question of exceptional times to covering results for point processes . in this section",
    "we give the definitions and state their relations to the beta - fleming - viot processes with mutations .",
    "+ all appearing stochastic processes and random variables will be defined on a common stochastic basis @xmath49 that is rich enough to carry all poisson point processes ( ppp in short ) that appear in the sequel .",
    "we recall that a continuous state branching process ( csbp in short ) with @xmath4-stable branching mechanism , @xmath31,2]$ ] , is a markov family @xmath50 of probability measures on cdlg trajectories with values in @xmath51 , such that @xmath52 where for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , we have the evolution equation @xmath55 for @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the branching mechanism for feller s branching diffusion , where @xmath58 is the law of the unique solution to the sde @xmath59 driven by a brownian motion @xmath60 . on the other hand , for @xmath351,2[$ ]",

    "alternatively this can be seen from the lookdown construction since at a fixed time @xmath1 , the level one has been looked down upon by infinitely many level above since the last mutation event on level one .",
    "we can thus write @xmath554 where the @xmath150 are enumerated in decreasing order .",

    "furthermore the sequence @xmath556 converges in distribution to a sequence of i.i.d random variables with common distribution @xmath101 because all the types that were present initially have been replaced by immigrated types after some time . to see this note that after the first mutation on level 1 , the type @xmath559 is pushed up to infinity in a finite time which is stochastically dominated by the fixation time of the type at level 1 in a beta fleming - viot without mutation .",
