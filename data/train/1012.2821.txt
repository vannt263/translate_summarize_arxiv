    "finite - size effects are also important when considering the combustion of powders @xcite , collective behavior ( e.g. animal flocks or traffic movement ) @xcite and granular gases @xcite .    excluded - volume or steric interactions arise from the mutual impenetrability of finite - size particles ( see fig .",

    ", the single - file diffusion of hard - core particles can be solved exactly by mapping it to the classical diffusion of point - particles @xcite .",

    "modified from minton @xcite . ]",
    "it is well - known that for finite - size particles the effective diffusion coefficient becomes concentration - dependent .",
    "in fact we have to distinguish between two alternative notions of diffusion coefficient : the collective diffusion coefficient , which describes the evolution of the total concentration , and the self - diffusion coefficient , which describes the evolution of a single tagged particle @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on collective diffusion , hereafter simply referred to as diffusion .",
    "batchelor @xcite models brownian diffusion of particles with hydrodynamic interaction using generalized einstein relations to find a concentration dependent correction to the collective diffusion coefficient .",
    "felderhof @xcite considers the same problem through an analysis of the fokker - planck equation , and includes both excluded volume and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "his analysis is based on the thermodynamic limit ( in which the number of particles @xmath0 and the system volume @xmath1 tend to infinity , with the concentration @xmath2 fixed ) , and is valid only for a small perturbation from the equilibrium concentration .",
    "similarly , the self - diffusion coefficient to first - order in a constant concentration is obtained from the generalized smoluchowski equation in @xcite .",
    "muramatsu and minton @xcite use a simple model to calculate the diffusion coefficient of hard spheres by estimating the probability that the target volume for a step in a random walk is free of any macromolecules .",
    "other authors model excluded volume phenomenologically by introducing a particle pressure , resulting in an equation of state in which the compressibility is reduced as the concentration increases @xcite .",
    "another popular approach is to consider lattice models , in which a particle can only move to a site if it is presently unoccupied .",
    "such an approach has been used to model diffusion of multiple species with size exclusion effects @xcite or to model the effect of crowding on diffusion - limited reaction @xcite .",
    "the preceding approaches are all either phenomenological in nature , restricted to small perturbations from a uniform concentration , or based on the thermodynamic limit in which the number of particles tends to infinity . here",
    "we consider a finite number of finite - sized particles diffusing in a box of fixed size .",
    "we perform an asymptotic analysis of the associated fokker - planck equation in the limit that the volume fraction of particles is small .",
    "our analysis is systematic , using the method of matched asymptotic expansions , but is not appropriate for concentrations close to the jamming limit .",
    "in order to focus on steric effects , we suppose that there are no electrostatic or hydrodynamic interaction forces between particles .",
    "we work in @xmath3 dimensions , where @xmath3 is either 2 or 3 .",
    "thus our starting point is a system of @xmath0 identical hard core diffusing and interacting spheres ( or disks ) , each with constant diffusion coefficient @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 , in a bounded domain @xmath6 in @xmath7 of typical diameter @xmath8 . by nondimensionalizing length with @xmath8 and time with @xmath9 , the size of the domain and",
    "the diffusion coefficient may be normalized to unity , while the diameter of the particles becomes @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the particles occupy a small volume fraction , so that @xmath11 .",
    "we denote the centers of the particles by @xmath12 at time @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "is the space available to a particle center , which is slightly smaller than the container due to the finite size of the particles . ]",
    "each center evolves according to the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath15 where the @xmath16 are @xmath0 independent @xmath3-dimensional standard brownian motions and @xmath17 is the external force on the @xmath18th particle . in general this force may include both inter - particle and external interactions , such as electromagnetic , friction , convection and potential forces , in which case @xmath17 depends on the positions of all the particles @xmath19 .",
    "while soft - core steric effects can also be built into @xmath17 , hard - core collisions can be more easily expressed as reflective boundary conditions on the `` collision surfaces '' @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "since we are focusing on hard - core particle interactions , we restrict ourselves to other external forces of the form @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 acts identically on all @xmath0 particles .",
    "we suppose that the initial positions @xmath24 are also random , and that they are independent and identically distributed .",
    "let @xmath25 be the joint probability density function of the @xmath0 particles .",
    "then , by the it formula , @xmath26 evolves according to the linear fokker - planck partial differential equation ( pde )    [ fp ] @xmath27 \\quad \\textrm{in}\\quad \\omega_\\epsilon^{n } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively stand for the gradient and divergence operators with respect to the @xmath0-particle position vector @xmath30 . note that because of steric effects , is not defined in @xmath31 but in its `` hollow form '' @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the set of all illegal configurations ( with at least one overlap ) . on the collision surfaces",
    "@xmath34 we have the reflecting boundary condition @xmath35 \\cdot        { \\vec n } = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\quad   \\partial       \\omega_\\epsilon ^n,\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 denotes the unit outward normal .",
    "since the initial positions of the particles are independent and identically distributed , the initial distribution function @xmath37 is invariant to permutations of the particle labels .",
    "the form of ( [ fp ] ) then means that @xmath38 itself is invariant to permutations of the particle labels for all time .",
    "although linear , the pde model is very high - dimensional , and it is impractical to solve it directly . since all the particles are identical , we are interested mainly in the marginal distribution function of the first particle , given by @xmath39 we aim to reduce the high - dimensional pde for @xmath38 to a low - dimensional pde for @xmath40 through a systematic asymptotic expansion as @xmath41 .      in the particular case of point - particles ( @xmath42 )",
    "the model reduction is straightforward . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 particles are independent and the domain is @xmath43 ( no holes ) , which implies that the internal boundary conditions in vanish .",
    "therefore @xmath44 , and    [ point ] @xmath45 \\quad   \\textrm{in } \\quad \\omega,\\\\   \\label{point_bc }   0&= \\left [ { \\boldsymbol \\nabla}_{{\\bf   x}_1 } \\",

    "note that since the particles are indistinguishable each satisfies the same diffusion equation and boundary condition , so that @xmath38 is a product of @xmath0 identical 1-particle distribution functions @xmath40 . if the particles were not identically distributed initially then we would need a different distribution function for each one ; although these would all satisfy the same diffusion equation they would have different initial conditions .",
    "this point will be important when we go on to consider finite - sized particles .",
    "when @xmath48 , the internal boundary conditions in mean the particles are no longer independent . when we integrate over @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and apply the divergence theorem we end up with surface integrals over the collision surfaces , on which @xmath38 must be evaluated . however ,",
    "when the particle volume fraction is small , the volume in @xmath52 occupied by configurations in which three or more particles are close is small [ @xmath53 compared to those in which two particles alone are in proximity [ @xmath54 .",
    "thus the dominant contribution to these `` collision integrals '' corresponds to two - particle collisions .",
    "we illustrate our approach for @xmath55 ; since two - particle collisions dominate the extension to arbitrary @xmath0 is straightforward .",

    "this is in contrast to the self - diffusion coefficient ( which may be related to the mean squared displacement of a particular particle ) which is reduced relative to point particles @xcite .",
    "this apparent contradiction may be understood as follows : the diffusion of any particular particle is impeded by its collisions with other particles .",
    "however , these collisions bias the random walk towards areas of low particle density , so that the overall spread of all particles is faster . to analyze the self - diffusion coefficient in the current framework we would need to label a particular particle , rather than treating all particles as identical .",
    "whilst the self - diffusion coefficient can be thought of a diffusion coefficient intrinsically attached to each particle , the collective diffusion coefficient relates the diffusive flux to the concentration gradient of all particles @xcite : the distribution function @xmath40 is the probability of finding _ any _ particle at a given position , rather than the probability of finding a particular particle there .",
    "thus the collective diffusion coefficient is not associated with an individual ( tagged ) particle or even a representative particle .",

    "the simulation time - step @xmath130 is chosen such that almost no collisions are missed .",
    "the theoretical predictions for both point and finite - size particles compare very well with their simulation counterparts , while steric effects are clearly appreciable even though the volume fraction of particles is only @xmath131 .",

    "our method justifies for example the ansatz made in @xcite to account for the finite size of the cells in the keller - segel model and prevent aggregation , and unlike @xcite does not rely on a closure assumption .",
    "the equation we have derived is for the one - particle distribution function , which measures the probability of finding _ any _ particle at a given position ; the particles we consider are identical and indistinguishable .",
    "this means that we are examining _ collective diffusion _ , and we find that this is enhanced by the finite size of the particles .",
    "we have not considered the self - diffusion of a particular ( tagged ) particle , which can be related to an individual particle s mean - square displacement . to analyze the self - diffusion coefficient in the current framework we would need to label a particular particle , rather than treating all particles as identical ; we intend to do this in a future work in which we consider multiple particle populations .",
    "we note that for point particles in one dimension ( where particles must move in single file and are not allowed to pass ) @xcite has observed density dependence in the self - diffusion ( mean square displacement ) of a tagged particle .",
    "their interpretation is that the expansion of the whole system from dense to dilute environments quickens the self - diffusion of any tagged particle .",
    "this is a different effect to the one we have observed , since , as mentioned in the introduction , the _ collective _ diffusion of point particles in one dimension is linear , with a diffusion coefficient independent of the density . in two dimensions self - diffusion is less sensitive to the particle density , since , informally , there is much more space for particles to pass each other .",
    "the method we have developed was implemented here in its simplest setting ( hard - core identical spherical particles with an external potential ) but it can be extended in many directions .",
    "particles of different size ( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) or shape can easily be incorporated , while the hard - core interaction between particles can be replaced by any short - range soft - core interaction .",
    "on the other hand , incorporating long range effects such as chemotaxis or electrostatic interactions is more challenging ; in such cases a system size expansion is likely to be needed in addition to a small particle expansion .",
