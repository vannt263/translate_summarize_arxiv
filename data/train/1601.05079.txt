    "the cms collaboration announced that they observed excess events in their search for new massive charged gauge bosons @xmath11 associated with the the su(2)@xmath1 gauge symmetry which decay into two leptons and dijet through heavy right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the excess was found in the invariant mass distribution of the two electrons and dijet @xmath12 final states around 2  tev , whose significance is 2.8@xmath0 .",
    "this signal , if confirmed , certainly implies the presence of tev - scale new physics .",
    "various models have been proposed so far to interpret this cms excess ; see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs",
    ".  @xcite . among them , models based on the @xmath13 gauge theory @xcite are the simplest and most promising candidates , since they contain right - handed neutrinos and @xmath14 as their indispensable ingredients .",
    "indeed , such models have attracted a lot of attentions recently @xcite since they can explain possible anomalies observed in other ( totally independent ) experiments , such as a 3.4@xmath0 excess in the atlas diboson resonance search @xcite , an around @xmath15 excess in the cms dijet resonance search @xcite , and a 2.2@xmath0 excess in the @xmath16 channel where @xmath17 decays leptonically and the higgs boson @xmath18 decays into @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "all of these results indicate the presence of @xmath14 with a mass of around @xmath4  tev .",
    "if such a tev - scale @xmath14 exists , in the @xmath20 models , we also expect that there are right - handed neutrinos whose masses are of @xmath21  tev .",
    "the presence of these right - handed neutrinos is desirable since we can exploit them to explain the cms @xmath2 excess events .",
    "an important caveat here is , however , that the cms collaboration observed only one same - sign electron event among all @xmath22 @xmath2 events @xcite .",
    "this observation disfavors the conventional @xmath23 model with an su(2)@xmath1 triplet higgs field ; in this case , right - handed neutrinos are majorana fermions , with which we expect the same number of same - sign dilepton events as that of the opposite - sign ones .",
    "in addition , tev - scale right - handed majorana neutrinos are stringently restricted by the recent atlas @xcite and cms searches @xcite in the same - sign leptons plus dijet final states .",
    "therefore , it is required to extend this conventional model so that it evades the above problems .",
    "the inverse seesaw @xcite mechanism offers a promising way to reconcile the difficulties . in this mechanism",
    ", three singlet fermions are added to the neutrino sector on top of right - handed neutrinos .",
    "then , small lepton - number violation in the singlet mass terms results in three light left - handed neutrinos as well as heavy pseudo - dirac neutrinos . since",
    "a neutrino which couples to @xmath14 is a pseudo - dirac fermion , the lepton number is approximately conserved in the process of @xmath14 decaying to the neutrino , which accounts for a lack of same - sign electron events in the cms @xmath2 signals .",
    "moreover , this mechanism has an advantage in explaining small neutrino masses with tev - scale @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "with such a low - scale symmetry - breaking of su(2)@xmath1 , the ordinary type - i seesaw mechanism @xcite can yield small neutrino masses only with very small yukawa couplings unless a specific mass structure is assumed @xcite , while the inverse seesaw mechanism allows the couplings to be sizable .",
    "this feature is favorable when the model is considered in the framework of grand unification @xcite like so(10 ) models @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an @xmath20 model that is extended to accommodate the inverse seesaw mechanism . for recent work which considers a similar model ,",
    "see ref .",
    "it is found that our model can actually realize the right number of @xmath2 signals observed in the cms experiment @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of our model is that it allows sizable left - right mixing in both the charged gauge boson and neutrino sectors .",
    "indeed , such a significant @xmath24@xmath25 mixing is favored from the viewpoint of the atlas diboson excess @xcite . moreover",
    ", the inverse seesaw mechanism allows a large left - right neutrino mixing while keeping neutrino masses tiny . in the presence of the left - right mixing",
    ", a heavy dirac neutrino can decay into not only the two leptons plus two jets final states via a virtual @xmath25 exchange , but also into a lepton plus a gauge / higgs boson channels via the left - right mixing .",
    "such decay processes yield a trilepton plus missing energy signature , which is regarded as the golden channel for probing heavy dirac neutrinos at the lhc @xcite .",
    "we study the prediction of our model in this channel , and find that the predicted number of events is in good agreement with the result given by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "we further discuss the future prospects for testing this model at the next stage of the lhc run .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we first describe our model which we consider in this work . in sec .",
    "[ sec : br ] , we show the decay branching ratios of @xmath25 and heavy dirac neutrinos .",
    "then , we study the collider signatures of our model in sec .  [ sec : lhc ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion and discussions .",
    "to begin with , we propose a model based on the @xmath26 gauge symmetry which has the structure of the inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite in the neutrino sector . as in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "left - handed quarks and leptons form @xmath27 doublet fields : @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the generation index . on the other hand ,",
    "right - handed fermions are embedded into the @xmath30 fundamental representation as @xmath31 in addition , we introduce three gauge - singlet fermions @xmath32 , which lead to chiral partner fields of @xmath33 as we see below .",
    "the higgs sector of this model contains two higgs multiplets .",
    "one is an @xmath34 bi - doublet scalar field with zero @xmath35 charge , which breaks the electroweak symmetry and thus plays a role of the sm higgs field .",
    "we denote it by @xmath36 and its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) by @xmath37 with @xmath38  gev .",
    "moreover , to break the su(2)@xmath1 symmetry , we introduce an su(2)@xmath1 doublet higgs field @xmath39 with a @xmath35 charge @xmath40 , whose vev is given by @xmath41 this breaks @xmath42 to @xmath43 .    with these particle contents , the interaction terms",
    "are generically given as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) being the pauli matrices , and @xmath48 indicates the charge conjugation .",
    "note that the majorana mass terms for right - handed neutrinos @xmath33 are forbidden by the su(2)@xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "after the above higgs fields develop the vevs , these interaction terms lead to the mass terms of the fermions . here",
    "we assume that these yukawa couplings and the vevs are appropriately chosen so that the resultant mass terms agree to the observed quark and lepton masses as well as the cabibbo ",
    " maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements . ;",
    "if we instead consider the type - ii two - higgs doublet model like structure , then @xmath49 should be equal to @xmath50 in order to explain the observed top - bottom mass ratio . ] the mass matrix of the neutrino sector is written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath53 with @xmath54 notice that the majorana mass terms for @xmath33 are still not produced due to the choice of the higgs field that breaks the su(2)@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "triplet higgs field with two unit of the @xmath35 charge to break the su(2)@xmath1 symmetry , then we would generically obtain majorana mass terms for @xmath33 .",
    "] here , we assume a hierarchical structure among the mass parameters in the matrix , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath55 while the other two classes of mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath56 .",
    "the latter can be regarded as pseudo - dirac neutrinos for @xmath57 .",
    "notice that small neutrino masses are guaranteed by the smallness of @xmath58 , and these masses vanish in the limit of @xmath59 .",
    "in this limit , the theory recovers the lepton - number symmetry , which results in three massless neutrinos and three heavy dirac neutrinos . since the @xmath60 term in eq .",
    "does not break any symmetry in our model , @xmath60 in principle can have arbitrary large value .",
    "we do not specify any mechanism to obtain a small @xmath61 in this paper , though there have been several proposal to explain the smallness of @xmath61 by exploiting spontaneous breaking of the lepton - number symmetry @xcite , extra dimensions @xcite , or generation of @xmath61 through radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "finally , we note in passing that an extremely small @xmath58 allows the lepton yukawa couplings @xmath62 to be sizable , which then indicates that the left - right mixing in the neutrino sector can also be significant .",
    "the vev of @xmath39 gives masses to not only heavy neutrinos but also gauge bosons associated with the broken symmetries .",
    "after the symmetry breaking , we have massive charged and neutral gauge bosons , @xmath3 and @xmath63 , whose masses are given by @xmath64 respectively . here , the su(2)@xmath1 gauge coupling constant @xmath65 and the @xmath35 gauge coupling constant @xmath66 are related to the u(1)@xmath67 gauge coupling constant @xmath68 by @xmath69 which follows from @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath35 denote the hypercharge , the su(2)@xmath1 generators , and the @xmath35 charge , respectively . from the relation",
    ", we find that there is a lower bound on the value of @xmath65 to keep the @xmath35 coupling perturbative ; for instance , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) leads to @xmath75 ( 0.36 ) .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , recently there have been various experimental observations which indicate the presence of @xmath3 with a mass of around 2  tev . motivated by these observations , throughout this paper , we assume @xmath76  tev . in this case , we can predict the mass of @xmath63 as a function of @xmath65 according to eqs .   and .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : mzprime ] , we plot @xmath77 as a function of @xmath65 . here",
    ", we set @xmath78  tev .",
    "currently , the most stringent limit on @xmath63 is given by the atlas collaboration using the @xmath79  fb@xmath80 data set at the center - of - mass energy of @xmath81  tev @xcite ( see also the cms result @xcite ) .",
    "according to the atlas result , the production cross section of @xmath63 times its branching fraction into two leptons @xmath82 @xmath83 , @xmath84 should be less than about 1  fb , which gives a lower limit on the @xmath63 mass of a several tev . this limit can easily be avoided if one takes @xmath85 .",
    "since @xmath76  tev means @xmath86",
    "tev , eq .   tells us that heavy pseudo - dirac neutrinos also have masses of @xmath87  tev . to explain the cms excess , we take one of these heavy neutrinos to have a mass lighter than @xmath88 and the others to have masses heavier than @xmath88 so that they do not participate in the decay of @xmath25 .",
    "we denote the former by @xmath89 and the latter by @xmath90 and @xmath91 in what follows .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath89 mainly couples to electron ; _ i.e. _ , its couplings with @xmath61 and @xmath92 leptons are negligible . in this setup , @xmath93 decays into a pair of right - handed quarks , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , or a @xmath89 plus an electron . in the last case ,",
    "the produced @xmath89 subsequently decays into an electron plus quarks via the exchange of a virtual @xmath3 .",
    "it can also decay into three leptons or a lepton plus two quarks via the @xmath17 , @xmath96 , or the higgs boson exchange if @xmath89 has a sizable left - handed neutrino component or @xmath24@xmath25 mixing is rather large .",
    "relevant formulae for the decay processes are summarized in the subsequent section .",
    "finally , we give a brief discussion about the constraint on @xmath25 coming from flavor physics . in this model , flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes",
    "can be induced by the exchange of @xmath25 , which are severely restricted from the low - energy precision flavor measurements . among them",
    ", the measurement of the @xmath97@xmath98 mass difference gives the most stringent bound on @xmath88 , which is roughly given by @xcite @xmath99 hence , @xmath25 with a mass of around 2  tev is still allowed by this bound when we take @xmath100 .",
    "here , we first summarize formulae relevant to the calculation of the partial decay widths of @xmath3 and @xmath89 . as mentioned above",
    ", @xmath93 decays into a pair of right - handed quarks , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , or a @xmath89 plus an electron . among them ,",
    "the @xmath94 and @xmath95 decay processes occur via the mixing of @xmath25 with @xmath24 boson .",
    "therefore , we begin with the discussion on the @xmath24@xmath25 mixing in our model . @xmath25 mixes with @xmath24 boson after the bi - doublet higgs field @xmath36 acquires a vev .",
    "the mass matrix of these gauge bosons is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 denote the su(2)@xmath103 gauge bosons , and @xmath104 .",
    "the mass matrix is diagonalized with an orthogonal matrix : @xmath105 here , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the mass eigenstates of the charged gauge bosons .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath108 and @xmath88 , respectively , with @xmath109 and @xmath88 given by eq .  .",
    "in what follows , we refer to the su(2)@xmath103-gauge - boson - like state @xmath106 as @xmath110 .",

    ", we have @xmath125 here , notice that although the @xmath25@xmath24@xmath96 coupling in eq .",
    "is suppressed by the small mixing angle @xmath111 , the partial decay width of the @xmath94 channel does not suffer from this suppression .",
    "this is because the high - energy behavior of the longitudinal mode of @xmath25 gives an enhancement factor of @xmath126 and this compensates the suppression factor from the mixing angle .",
    "finally , the @xmath127 decay width is given by @xmath128 where we assume the decoupling limit for the higgs bosons in our model .",

    "when the mass of @xmath89 is rather large and the left - right mixing is very small , the three - body decay process via the virtual @xmath113 exchange is dominant .",

    "such a sizable decay fraction allows the model to explain the cms @xmath2 excess , as we will see below .",

    "the number of the same - sign dielectron events due to the sm backgrounds is expected to be @xmath198 ; thus , this observation is totally consistent with a hypothesis that all of the signal events consist of opposite - sign dielectron events .",
    "the signal acceptance @xmath199 is listed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for instance , for @xmath200  tev and @xmath201  tev , we have @xmath202 .",
    "this implies that if the signal cross section of the @xmath2 channel is @xmath203  fb , then the predicted number of events falls right in the middle of the observed number .    in our model ,",
    "the @xmath2 decay process is induced via the virtual @xmath25 exchange by a @xmath89 , @xmath204 as well as via the on - shell @xmath24 which is a decay product of @xmath89 : @xmath205 notice that we expect opposite - sign electrons in the final state , rather than same - sign dielectron , since lepton - number violation is significantly suppressed by the very small mass parameters @xmath60 in our model .",
    "this is consistent with the cms observation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : eejj ] , we plot the signal cross section for the @xmath2 channel times the acceptance @xmath199 as functions of @xmath142 . here",
    ", we set @xmath150  tev and @xmath160 .",
    "the red solid , green dotted , and blue dash - dotted lines show the cases of @xmath206 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 , respectively .",
    "the acceptance is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . from these plots",
    ", we find that although the decay branching ratios of @xmath89 significantly depend on @xmath149 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : brnrre1 ] , the signal cross section for the @xmath2 mode does not depend on @xmath209 so much ; if one takes @xmath149 large , the @xmath210 decay channel of @xmath89 could be subdominant , but in this case the three - body @xmath211 decay mode becomes dominant , which makes the total signal cross section for the @xmath2 decay channel almost unchanged .",
    "we also show the value of the signal cross section which corresponds to 10 events for an integrated luminosity of 19.7  fb@xmath80 by the horizontal gray line in this figure .",
    "it is found that the observed event number is reproduced if @xmath142 is in the range of @xmath2121.7  tev .",
    "we however note that because of the low statistics we expect a large uncertainty in the extraction of the favored signal cross section .",
    "furthermore , our computation also suffers from uncertainty resulting from the estimation of the acceptance . in our analysis , we took the acceptance rate given by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "however , this acceptance is estimated for the three - body decay of @xmath89 via the off - shell @xmath25 exchange process . on the other hand , in our model",
    ", the two - body decay of @xmath89 into @xmath210 also gives rise to the @xmath2 final state .",
    "this contribution may result in a different value of acceptance @xmath199 .",
    "considering these possible uncertainties , we conclude that at present any values of @xmath213  tev may be consistent with the cms @xmath2 search result .",
    "now let us discuss possibilities to probe our model in the trilepton plus large missing energy mode . as we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : diboson ] , @xmath193 is favored in order to explain the atlas diboson anomaly . in this case , the dominant decay mode of @xmath89 is always the @xmath210 final state .",
    "this state can subsequently decay into the three charged leptons plus a light neutrino final state .",
    "therefore , our setup discussed so far in general predicts a sizable signal rate in the trilepton plus large missing energy searches .    to illustrate this",
    ", we compare the prediction of our model with the cms result of the search for the trilepton plus missing energy signatures at the center - of - mass energy of @xmath214  tev with the 19.5  fb@xmath80 integrated luminosity @xcite . as we have assumed above",
    ", the flavor - violating processes are negligible in our setup .",
    "hence , we focus on events which contain an opposite - sign same - flavor ( ossf ) lepton pair . this category is called ossf1 in ref .  @xcite . moreover , since @xmath89 only couples to an electron , this pair should be @xmath215.-boson mass .",
    "this rejects the @xmath216 events , and thus we do not expect final states which include a pair of @xmath217 . ] therefore , the trilepton events we consider below include either @xmath218 or @xmath219 .    in our analysis , we generate the trilepton plus missing energy events using madgraph5 @xcite and evaluate the parton - level cross sections with the cteq6l parton distribution function set @xcite .",
    "the cross sections are multiplied by the @xmath174-factor of @xmath220 @xcite . the showering and hadronization",
    "are executed with pythia6.4 @xcite , while we use delphes3 @xcite for the detector simulation .",
    "jet - clustering is performed with fastjet2 @xcite based on the anti-@xmath221 algorithm with a distance parameter of @xmath222 .",
    "we impose the same criterion for the event selection as those used in ref .",
    "@xcite :    * electrons and muons are required to satisfy that their transverse momentum @xmath223 be larger than 10  gev and the magnitude of their pseudo - rapidity @xmath224 be smaller than 2.4 .",
    "they should be separated from each other by @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is the azimuthal angle . *",
    "at least one electron or muon should have @xmath227  gev .",
    "* jets should satisfy @xmath228  gev and @xmath229 .",
    "they are required to be separated from a lepton by @xmath230 .",
    "* for each event , we construct ossf charged leptons @xmath231 @xmath232 and require that the invariant mass of these charged leptons , @xmath233 , should be @xmath234  gev .",
    "* we reject the `` on - z '' events in which a pair of ossf charged leptons yields @xmath235  gev .",
    "then , we classify each event into several categories according to ref .",
    "firstly , we divide all events into two classes : one with the scalar sum of jet transverse momentum , @xmath236 , being @xmath237  gev and the other with @xmath238  gev .",
    "secondly , we divide each class in terms of the missing transverse energy @xmath239 : @xmath240  gev , @xmath241  gev , or @xmath242  gev . here",
    ", @xmath239 is the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse momenta . finally ,",
    "if all possible ossf pairs give @xmath243  gev ( @xmath244  gev ) , then the corresponding event is called an above - z ( below - z ) event .",
    ".simulated number of events in our model for the 8  tev run with an integrated luminosity of 19.5  fb@xmath80 . here",
    ", we set @xmath245  tev , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath155 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab : simulation ] and [ tab : simulationmi5 ] , we show the number of events in each category simulated in our analysis for the 8  tev run with an integrated luminosity of 19.5  fb@xmath80 . here",
    ", we set @xmath150  tev , @xmath246 , @xmath155 and @xmath248 ( @xmath249 ) in table  [ tab : simulation ] ( table  [ tab : simulationmi5 ] ) .",
    "we show the results for two cases , @xmath201 and 1.6  tev .",
    "it turns out that our model prediction is consistent with the current data .",
    "moreover , we find that our model potentially accounts for a small deviation from the sm prediction in the @xmath250  gev , @xmath251  gev , and @xmath243  gev category without conflicting with the results in the other categories .",
    "this observation indicates that the trilepton plus missing energy search at the lhc run - ii will offer a promising way to test our scenario in the near future , together with other @xmath25 searches .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed an extended gauge sector model based on the @xmath252 gauge theory which accommodates the inverse seesaw structure in the neutrino sector . we have found that our model can explain the cms @xmath2 anomaly and the atlas diboson excess simultaneously , without conflicting with existing experimental bounds .",
    "to explain these two anomalies ,",
    "we need sizable left - right mixing in the gauge sector . such left - right mixing can also appear in the neutrino sector because of the inverse seesaw structure .",
    "this allows us to probe our model in the searches for the trilepton plus missing energy signatures .",
    "after all , we expect that the lhc run - ii experiments will test our setup in the near future and shed light on the nature of tev - scale physics beyond the sm .",

    "<S> the cms collaboration has reported a 2.8@xmath0 excess in the search of the su(2)@xmath1 gauge bosons decaying through right - handed neutrinos into the two electron plus two jets ( @xmath2 ) final states . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained if the su(2)@xmath1 charged gauge bosons @xmath3 have a mass of around @xmath4  tev and a right - handed neutrino with a mass of @xmath5  tev mainly decays to electron . indeed , recent results in several other experiments , especially that from the atlas diboson resonance search , also indicate signatures of such a @xmath4  tev gauge boson . however , a lack of the same - sign electron events in the cms @xmath2 search challenges the interpretation of the right - handed neutrino as a majorana fermion . </S>",
    "<S> taking this situation into account , in this paper , we consider a possibility of explaining the cms @xmath2 excess based on the @xmath6 gauge theory with pseudo - dirac neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the cms excess events and the atlas diboson anomaly can actually be explained in this framework without conflicting with the current experimental bounds . </S>",
    "<S> this setup in general allows sizable left - right mixing in both the charged gauge boson and neutrino sectors , which enables us to probe this model through the trilepton plus missing - energy search at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the number of events in this channel predicted in our model is in good agreement with that observed by the cms collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss prospects for testing this model at the lhc run - ii experiments .    </S>",
