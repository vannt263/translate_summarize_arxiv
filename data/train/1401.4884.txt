    "the concepts of controllability and observability are important contribution of control theorists to the science , technology , and engineering domain . with the introduction of these structural concepts , we begin to deeply understand the relationship between the input - output description and state - space description .",
    "the concept of controllability was first proposed for linear systems by r. e. kalman in his remarkable paper@xcite in 1960s .",
    "controllability of nonlinear systems was further investigated by h. j. sussmann and v. jurdjevic@xcite and r. hermann and a. j. krener@xcite in 1970s .",
    "quantum control theory has been developed ever since last century@xcite .",
    "recently , quantum information and quantum computation is the focus of reseach@xcite .",
    "a great progress has been made in the domain of quantum control@xcite , in which the controllability of quantum systems is a fundamental issue . in 1980s ,",
    "controllability of quantum systems was first explored by g. m. huang , t .- j .",
    "tarn and j. w. clark@xcite .",
    "the different notations of controllability have been exploited in @xcite .",
    "specially , the controllability of quantum open systems has been studied by some researchers@xcite .    to manipulate a quantum system ,",
    "it is not sufficient to just know whether or not the quantum system is controllable .",
    "it is necessary to know how to construct permissible controls to steer the quantum system within the the specified time @xmath1 in some applications .",
    "we need explore controllability of quantum systems under different permissible control conditions such as bounded controls and time continuous function controls , and exploit the impact of admissible control conditions on the performance indices including transition time .    given a control system , whether quantum or classical , the first and most important question about its various properties is to investigate whether or not it is stable .",
    "the most useful and general approach for studying the stability and stabilizability is the theory introduced by russian mathematician a. m. lyapunov@xcite in the late 19@xmath2 century .",
    "lyapunov s pioneering work on stability received little attention outside russia , although it was translated into french in 1908 ( at the instigation of poincare ) , and reprinted by princeton university press in 1947 .",
    "the publication of the work of lure and a book@xcite by la salle and lefschetz brought lyapunov s work to the attention of the larger control engineering community in the early 1960 s .",
    "several quantitative stability concepts like finite - time stability@xcite , lipschitz stability@xcite , partial stablity@xcite and practical stability@xcite had been investigated based on lyapunov s great work in 20@xmath2 century .",
    "set stability of dynamical systems was specifically discussed by heinen james albin@xcite in 1969 . in 2002 ,",
    "s. k. phooi et al.@xcite further proposed the broad - sense lyapunov function and generalized the notion of stability in the sense of lyapunov .    from control theory point of view , we not only need to investigate whether a dynamical system is stable or not , but also need to explore whether or not a controlled dynamical system is stabilizable by permissible control .    in recent applications like quantum information storage , one of the important questions is whether or not a given state of quantum systems can be stabilizable by permissible controls . to study the stabilizability problem of quantum systems , we will have to exploit how to define the equilibrium points of schr@xmath0dinger equation .",
    "just by investigating stabilizability problem of controlled quantum closed system , we gradually realize that the physical conditions for stabilizability of quantum systems are too strict in some concrete systems like nuclear - soin systems .",
    "these observations indicate that we need to weaken a more general framework .",
    "to overcome the aforementioned difficulties , we try to generalize the concepts of both controllability and stabilizability . with quantum control problems in mind , we will propose a new notion of set - stabilizability : given a pair of quantum state sets @xmath3 and @xmath4 , a quantum system is @xmath4-stabilizability from @xmath3 within the specified time @xmath1 under constrained control conditions if , for any initial state in @xmath3 , on can always find permissible controls to steer the quantum system from an arbitrary initial state in @xmath3 to another arbitrary state in the set @xmath4 in the finite time @xmath5 with @xmath6 , and to further keep the system state stay in the set @xmath4 when @xmath7 .",
    "it is interesting to underline the following observations : ( 1 ) when @xmath4 is a one - point set , set - stabilizability notation is reduced to stabilizability .",
    "( 2 ) when both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the state space itself and unconstrained controls are permitted , the concept of set stabilizability is reduced to controllability proposed by kalman@xcite .",
    "however , the set - stabilizability is not proposed to generalize the concepts of both controllability and stabilizability just for the sake of generalization , without proper motivations .",
    "this work can be regarded as one of explorations made by many researchers who hope to investigate what kind of control goal is achievable for quantum systems by various feedback control@xcite .",
    "stabilization of open quantum systems has been studied by @xcite . in this research , we exploit what kind of stabilizability can be expected for quantum closed systems by constrained open - loop controls , and we would like to emphasize that set stabilizability is attained by coherent control even when stabilizability itself is not an achievable control goal .",
    "it should be also underlined that this research is very different from set value analysis@xcite and set dynamics@xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper are organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , the concept and properties of set - stabilizability are presented for general dynamical systems , and it is revealed that both controllability and stabilizability are the special case of set stabilizability . the notation of set stabilizability and stabilizability are specifically discussed for quantum closed systems . in sect .",
    "iii , the set stabilizability and stabilizability problems of single - qubit systems are explored under different constrained controls .",
    "we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for quantum systems and give some further discussions on the strictness of stabilizability in sect .",
    "iv , and it is also exemplified that set - stabilizability notation can be used for exploring entanglement generation of two - qubit systems in this section .",
    "the paper concludes with sect . v.",
    "for the purpose of further discussions , we first recite the axiomatic definition of a dynamical system presented by kalman in 1960s@xcite .    *",
    "definition 1*. a dynamical system is a mathematical structure defined by the following axioms :    ( @xmath8 ) there is given a state space @xmath9 and a set of values of time @xmath10 at which the behaviour of the system is defined ; @xmath9 is a topological space and @xmath10 is an ordered topological space which is a subset of the real numbers .",

    "this function is defined only for @xmath17 . moreover ,",
    "any @xmath20 in @xmath10 , any @xmath15 in @xmath9 , and any fixed @xmath16 in @xmath12 defined over @xmath21\\cap{t}$ ] , the following relations hold :    @xmath22    @xmath23    in addition , the system must be nonanticipatory , i.e. , if @xmath24 and @xmath25 on @xmath21\\cap{t}$ ] we have @xmath26    ( @xmath27 ) every output of the system is a function @xmath28reals .",
    "( @xmath29 ) the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 are continuous , with respect to the topologies defined for @xmath9 , @xmath32 , and @xmath12 and the induced product topologies .    in other words ,",
    "a dynamical system can be described by @xmath33 . for a dynamical system without output ,",
    "it can be reduced to @xmath34 .",
