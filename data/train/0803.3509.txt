    "we think that a dangerous gap between theory and experiment has appeared in this field of science .",

    ", we will try to close this gap .",
    "our review does not contain a sequential description of the mathematical techniques involved in formulating hypotheses and theories .",
    "instead , we outline the physical ideas , concepts , and assumptions that are often omitted in theoretical works and reviews , especially at the stage of a developed theory . this specific feature is thought to make our review interesting and useful for experimentalists .",
    "on the other hand , we did not tend to accumulate , classify , and estimate the huge experimental data obtained in this field .",
    "we address experiment to demonstrate the use of a theory for its interpretation and the related difficulties and problems .",
    "this specific feature is thought to make our review interesting and useful for theorists .",
    "we first qualitatively discuss the ides that constitute the basis of the theory of quantum phase transitions .",
    "we then consider how the general theoretical scheme can describe the well - known data on metal  insulator transitions and transitions between different quantum hall liquids .    before discussing quantum phase transitions in essence",
    ", we briefly recall some facts from statistical physics . we consider a macroscopic system consisting of a huge number of particles .",
    "this system is almost isolated and behaves mainly as a closed system ; however , it can exchange particles and energy with a larger system , which serves as a reservoir . in other words ,",
    "our system is a subsystem of this reservoir .",
    "we first analyze the classical subsystem at a finite temperature t. according to classical statistics formulas , the probability @xmath0 for the subsystem to occupy the state with energy @xmath1 is @xmath2 where the coefficient @xmath3 is determined by the normalization condition @xmath4 @xmath5 ( hereafter , temperature is given in energy units ) .",
    "function @xmath6 is called the partition function .",
    "it plays a key role in the description of the thermodynamic properties of classical objects . that the subsystem energy obeys distribution ( [ a ] ) rather than being fixed means the presence of classical thermal fluctuations .",
    "when quantum mechanics appeared , the basis of classical thermodynamics and its principal formulas were revised .",
    "the classical expressions were found to have a limited field of application .",
    "quantum statistics requires a developed quantum - mechanics math - based environment . before addressing this environment ,",
    "we assume that the subsystem is completely closed and does not interact with the large system . as a result",
    ", we can use the standard quantum mechanics technique and use the schrdinger steady - state equation to describe the subsystem .",
    "the resulting set of steady - state energies @xmath7 and the corresponding wavefunctions @xmath8 of the subsystem are considered to be subsystem attributes in the zeroth approximation .",
    "these energies , @xmath7 , enter eqn ( [ b ] ) .",
    "the set of @xmath8 functions is convenient because it is related to the subsystem under study and is a complete set ; therefore , it can be used for expansion into a series .",
    "the presence of a huge number of particles in the subsystem implies that it has a very dense energy distribution of quantum levels . due to a weak interaction with the reservoir ,",
    "the subsystem is in the so - called mixed state , in which no measurement or a set of measurements can lead to unambiguously predicted results . upon determining the mixed state ,",
    "the repeated measurements of any physical quantity give a near - average result that differs from the previous one .",
    "the scatter of the measured physical quantities is interpreted as a result of fluctuations .",
    "because the subsystem interacts with the environment , it can not be described by a wave function ; therefore , the wave function is substituted by a density matrix , @xmath9 where @xmath10 corresponds to the set of subsystem coordinates , @xmath11 are the remaining coordinates of the system , and @xmath12 is the wave function of the closed system .",
    "the mean values of any physical quantity @xmath13 are now calculated using the density matrix @xmath14   \\rule[-2mm]{0pt}{12pt}\\right\\ }   _ { q'=q}dq,\\qquad   a=\\int\\rho(q , q)dq.\\ ] ] rather than a wave function .",
    "in eqn ( [ ab ] ) , we apply the operator @xmath15 , which acts on functions of the variable @xmath10 , to the density matrix @xmath16 ; we then set @xmath17 and integrate .",
    "the operator that formally enters the expression for the normalization factor @xmath18 is identical with unity ; therefore , the condition @xmath17 is naturally taken into account in the integrand .    according to general rule([ab ] ) , the mean of coordinate @xmath19 , for example , is given by @xmath20    the physical meaning of the density matrix can be clarified if we write it in an explicit form for the subsystem in statistical equilibrium at a finite temperature @xmath21 : @xmath22 for the subsystem in statistical equilibrium , it follows from eqns ( [ q ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) @xmath23 the averaging with the density matrix performed in eqn ( [ q+dm ] ) account for both the probabilistic description in the form of @xmath24 in quantum mechanics and incomplete information about the system ( statistical averaging ) .",
    "we use the @xmath8 functions and write the function @xmath16 in the matrix form @xmath25 in eqn ( [ ab ] ) , we then have @xmath26 the @xmath27 matrix constructed from the set of @xmath8 functions is called the statistical matrix and , in essence , is the normalized density matrix .    we replace @xmath15 with the energy operator @xmath28 in eqn ( [ ab ] ) and",
    "obtain @xmath29 this means that the probability @xmath0 of detecting the energy @xmath7 in the subsystem is equal to the diagonal element of the matrix @xmath30 , @xmath31 equation ( [ c ] ) is the quantum analog of eqn ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the statistical matrix has a number of universal properties . by definition ,",
    "this matrix is normalized : @xmath32 as follows from eqn ( [ dm ] ) , the statistical matrix is diagonal in statistical equilibrium .",
    "its diagonal elements are functions of only the energy of the corresponding subsystem state @xmath7 . until at least one @xmath30 with @xmath33",
    "has a nonzero value , the subsystem state remains mixed , and any measured quantity undergoes fluctuations .",
    "the macroscopic system is in a mixed state mainly due to a finite temperature .",
    "a comparison of eqns ( [ a ] ) and ( [ c ] ) demonstrates that in the high - temperature limit , the statistical matrix obeys the gibbs distribution    @xmath34    with a good accuracy .",
    "because the integral of the squared wave function @xmath8 over the entire coordinate space is @xmath35 the partition function @xmath6 can be represented as the sum of the diagonal matrix elements of the operator @xmath36 over the complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath37 :    @xmath38    here , we use that @xmath37 are eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath39 to obtain @xmath40 .",

    "as the subsystem is open , it interacts with the environment . even if this interaction is very weak",
    ", the states of the macroscopic system become mixed in a certain small energy range due to the extremely high density of the system energy levels .",
    "therefore , even at zero temperature , the unclosed subsystem is in a mixed state .",
    "this means that as the temperature decreases , each @xmath42 @xmath43 element approaches a temperature - independent constant , which depends on @xmath7 and the sizes and properties of the subsystem , rather than tending to zero exponentially .",
    "thermal fluctuations are replaced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "this statement is illustrated by fig.[spector1]a , which qualitatively shows the temperature dependence of the probability @xmath0 of detecting the energy @xmath7 in the subsystem .",
    "the dashed lines separate the regions of predominantly quantum and predominantly thermal fluctuations . the limiting value @xmath44 is specified by the energy @xmath7 , sizes , and properties of the subsystem .     of the statistical matrix corresponding to low energies .",
    "( b ) simultaneous excitation of thermal and quantum fluctuations ]    in this subsystem , @xmath44 obviously decreases with an increase in @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that this dependence is a power - law function , @xmath45 , and obtain the lower estimate of the exponent @xmath46 .",
    "energy for thermal fluctuations is taken from the reservoir .",
    "a finite , not exponentially small , probability of detecting the subsystem in a state @xmath47 means a violation of the energy conservation law .",
    "this violation can exist in the framework determined by the uncertainty relation    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the lifetime of the state @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , even if transitions to all @xmath7 states were equiprobable , @xmath44 would decrease according to the law @xmath50 , as follows from eqn ( [ uncert ] ) . as a result , we have @xmath51 it is essential that the energy range in which quantum fluctuations occur is temperature independent , which follows from uncertainty relation ( [ uncert ] )",
    ".    the relative role of thermal and quantum fluctuations is illustrated in fig.[spector1]b , which shows the excitation spectrum of the subsystem in one of the phases , i.e. , far from phase transition point @xmath52 .",
    "the brace in the bottom left part of fig.[spector1]b indicates the temperature - related scale . only modes with frequencies @xmath53 are classically excited modes .",
    "although the range of thermal modes is bounded above by temperature , they have large occupation numbers .",
    "modes with @xmath54 are mainly excited due to quantum processes and have small occupation numbers .",
    "however , as the temperature decreases , the role of quantum excitations increases .",
    "* 2.1 definition of a quantum phase transition . *",
    "quantum phase transitions are phase transitions that can occur at the absolute zero @xmath55 and consist of a change in _ the ground state _ of a system in the case where a certain control parameter @xmath56 takes a critical value @xmath57 .",
    "( the ground state is taken to be the lowest possible mixed state . )",
    "the control parameter can be , for instance , a magnetic field or an electron concentration .",
    "quantum phase transitions belong to the class of continuous transitions at which none of the physical functions of state has a discontinuity at the transition point .",
    "a quantum fluctuation is the only cause that can change the ground state of the system at zero temperature ; the phase transitions under study are therefore called quantum phase transitions . as in the case of thermodynamic transitions , the concept of a correlation length @xmath58 , which has the meaning of the average quantum - fluctuation size , is introduced into the theory of quantum phase transitions . at the absolute zero temperature , @xmath58 is only determined by the deviation @xmath59 of the control parameter from the critical value . the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath59 is assumed to be a power - law function ,    @xmath60    real experiments are always performed at finite temperatures , where thermal fluctuations exist in addition to quantum fluctuations .",
    "the goal of the theory is to predict the manifestation of the phase transition that occurs only at zero temperature in the properties of the system at a finite temperature .",
    "the theory of quantum phase transitions ( see , e.g. , book @xcite or reviews @xcite ) is analogous to the theory of thermodynamic phase transitions . in the @xmath61 plane ( i.e. , in a plane where temperature is plotted versus a control parameter )",
    ", the quantum transition point can be a finite point on the line of thermodynamic transitions , @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",
    "for example , this behavior is characteristic of magnetic transitions with the magnetic field used as a control parameter .",
    "quantum phase transitions of another type also exist ; they are imaged by isolated point @xmath64 on the abscissa axis of the @xmath65 plane . the metal ",
    "insulator transition is an example of such a transition . in this review ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of isolated - point transitions .    *",
    "2.2 parallels and differences between classical and quantum phase transitions *    as noted above , quantum phase transitions belong to the class of continuous transitions ; there are no two coexisting competitive phases and , hence , no stationary boundary between them .",
    "this class also includes thermodynamic second - order phase transitions . at a thermodynamic phase transition point ,",
    "the system transforms into another phase as a whole as a result of thermal fluctuations .",
    "fluctuations exist on either side of the transition , and their characteristic size @xmath58 is called the correlation length . as the transition is approached from either side , @xmath58 diverges @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect a similar situation to occur in the vicinity of a quantum transition with the participation of quantum fluctuations .",
    "an analogy between classical and quantum phase transitions does exist , and it is rather unexpected . _ the behavior of a quantum system in the vicinity of a transition point at a finite temperature in a d - dimensional space is analogous to the behavior of a classical system in a space with dimension @xmath66 .",
    "_ this statement requires extensive explanations , which should include an algorithm for the introduction of such an imaginary system and the determination of its dimension .",
    "first , we have to clearly distinguish between the dimension of the geometric space in which the system is located and the dimension of the generalized - coordinate space , which depends on the number of particles @xmath67 in the system .",
    "if @xmath68 is the density of particles in the space , we have @xmath69 , where the dimension @xmath70 determines the multiplicity of the integral .",
    "usually , a @xmath70-dimensional space is assumed to be infinite in all directions , but the range of one or several @xmath71 coordinates can be limited .",
    "second , we note a similarity between the operator @xmath72 , which was used to write eqn ( [ qpt3 ] ) , and the operator @xmath73 that describes the evolution of a closed quantum system with time according to the schrdinger equation @xmath74 this similarity becomes obvious if we change the variables as @xmath75    with substitution ( [ qpt11 ] ) , we can interpret the matrix elements in eqn ( [ qpt3 ] ) differently",
    ". the element @xmath76 can be regarded as the amplitude of the probability that , starting from state @xmath77 , the subsystem evolves under the action of @xmath73 and returns to the initial state @xmath78 within imaginary time @xmath79 , which is equal to @xmath80 .",
    "the imaginary time @xmath79 is often called the matsubara time . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the number of steps is fixed and equal to @xmath81 , @xmath82 and that , in time @xmath83 , the subsystem has passed through @xmath84 virtual states and occupied each state for a time @xmath85 ; as a result , we have    @xmath86    the amplitude of ` the probability of returning to the initial state ' means the sum of the amplitudes of the probabilities of returning for all possible trajectories in the space of states .",
    "we consider a set of trajectories consisting of @xmath84 steps .",
    "the operator entering each matrix element in eqn ( [ qpt3 ] ) is represented as    @xmath87    we take a complete set of wavefunctions @xmath88 of an arbitrary operator that does not commute with the hamiltonian and assume that the trajectories are realized in these states .",
    "then , instead of eqn ( [ qpt3 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath89    the product of the matrix elements in the summand corresponds to a chain of consecutive virtual transitions .",
    "the summation over all @xmath90 combinations means that all possible closed chains of @xmath84 links are taken into account .",
    "the modification of the expression for @xmath6  the replacement of eqn ( [ qpt3 ] ) with eqn ( [ z1 ] )  means that we take the quantum properties of the system into account by adding virtual transitions to real ones .",
    "-dimensional systems located in a one - dimensional band of width @xmath91and virtual transition between them ]    the introduction of virtual transitions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ d+1 ] , where the abscissa axis stands for the initial @xmath70-dimensional space @xmath92 and all possible classical states of the system are located along this axis in the order of increasing energy .",
    "all other horizontal lines are replicas of this space .",
    "these replicas form a set of @xmath84 elements in the segment @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "the black dot on the abscissa axis represents the initial state of the system with energy @xmath7 .",
    "the second black dot on the upper horizontal line corresponds to the ` final ' state of the system with the same energy @xmath7 at the maximum value of the imaginary time @xmath94 .",
    "the arrows indicate the chain of virtual transitions through the set of virtual states @xmath88 designated by white dots .",
    "these are mixed states without a definite energy ; therefore , they are not eigenstates of the operator @xmath95 .",
    "the virtual transitions reflecting the quantum properties of the statistical system under study are shown by arrows .",
    "the chain of virtual transitions shown in fig .",
    "[ d+1 ] corresponds to one term in the sum in ( [ z1 ] ) .",
    "the summation over all @xmath90 combinations means that we account for all possible chains between the fixed initial and final @xmath7 points .",
    "now , the problem is to construct a classical system whose partition function is represented by eqn ( [ z1 ] ) . in the original eqn ( [ qpt3 ] ) ,",
    "the summation over @xmath96 meant the summation over all the states realized in a @xmath70-dimensional system .",
    "the number of terms in the sum is now increased , and our real system does not have such a large number of different states .",
    "nevertheless , we can construct an imaginary classical system with a higher dimension using the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ d+1 ] .",
    "we add an additional axis for an imaginary time to the @xmath70 axes of the original space . in the graphical terms of fig .",
    "[ d+1 ] , this means that an ordinate axis is added to the abscissa axis .",
    "it is seen from eqn ( [ qpt12 ] ) that the coordinate along this new axis changes in the range    @xmath97    each point in the strip ( [ qpt15 ] ) in fig .",
    "[ d+1 ] corresponds to some virtual state of the quantum system ; it can be named the image point .",
    "the width ( [ qpt15 ] ) of strip in which an image point is located increases with decreasing the temperature . at @xmath55 ,",
    "the strip transforms into a half - plane ; an increase in the temperature , in contrast , narrows the band and decreases its contribution to the statistical properties of the quantum system .",
    "we repeat the @xmath70-dimensional classical system @xmath84 times by placing replicas along the imaginary time @xmath79 axis at a distance @xmath98 from each other .",
    "the states of the replicas in this ensemble can be different .",
    "let these states be @xmath99 .",
    "we fix a certain ` initial ' state of the ` lower ' subsystem @xmath7 . the energy of the classical @xmath100-dimensional system , we are constructing , is equal to the sum of the energies of all layers , with allowance for the interaction between them .",
    "each @xmath101 corresponds to a certain energy @xmath7 of the initial @xmath70-dimensional classical system and a certain chain of states entering eqn ( [ z1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the number of terms in the sum @xmath102 in eqn ( [ z1 ] ) is equal to the number of different @xmath101 energies .",
    "we note that each @xmath103 term in sum has a form typical for partition sums , since the product of the matrix elements in this term eventually reduces to the product of @xmath104 .",
    "the only difference is that for the classical system , each term in @xmath6 is a real positive number and , in eqn ( [ z1 ] ) , a real positive number is represented by the sum @xmath105 over @xmath106 of all @xmath103 products .",
    "when neglecting this difference , we can consider eqn ( [ z1 ] ) the partition function @xmath6 of the imaginary @xmath100-dimensional classical system .",
    "of course , in the general form , the resulting mathematical construction is absolutely unpractical .",
    "however , as is customary in deriving scaling relations , it is important to reveal some significant properties of sum ( [ z1 ] ) rather than to calculate it . as is shown in section 2.3 ,",
    "one of these properties is anisotropy , i.e. , non equivalence of the axes of the @xmath100-dimensional space .     versus a control parameter ( dashed line ) .",
    "at a control parameter @xmath107 , phase 1 is subjected to fluctuation excitation inside equilibrium phase 2 . because @xmath108 , thermal fluctuation play a key role in this excitation ]    at a thermodynamic phase transition point , the partition function @xmath6 has special features .",
    "the sensitivity of function ( [ qpt3 ] ) to the presence of a phase transition is caused by the fact that , when the transition is approached , the energy range @xmath21 determining significant terms in sum ( [ qpt3 ] ) contains not only @xmath37 levels from the set corresponding to the equilibrium phase but also @xmath109 levels from the nonequilibrium phase ( fig .",
    "[ spector2 ] ) .",
    "this allows fluctuation transitions between @xmath78 and @xmath110 levels from different sets .",
    "additional possibilities appear after eqn ( [ qpt3 ] ) is replaced with eqn([z1 ] ) .",
    "if the temperature is low @xmath111 , the fluctuation - induced appearance of another phase is also possible , but due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "a region in which all physical quantities depend only on the correlation length @xmath58 always exists in the phase plane near a classical phase transition .",
    "it is called the critical or scaling region . near a quantum phase transition at @xmath55",
    ", there also exists a control parameter @xmath112 range in which physical quantities are expressed through the length @xmath58 determined by eqn ( [ dop1 ] ) . in section 4 , we show this behavior by the example of a metal  insulator transition in a three - dimensional system of noninteracting electrons , and determine the boundaries of this region . at a finite temperature @xmath113 , however , the scaling region of a quantum phase transition is more complex .",
    "the space @xmath114 has dimension @xmath115 because of the additional imaginary time axis .",
    "we introduce correlation lengths in the space @xmath114 .",
    "we retain the traditional notation @xmath58 for the correlation length in an ordinary @xmath70-dimensional subspace and let @xmath116 denote the correlation length along the additional axis .",
    "the subscript @xmath117 is a reminder that @xmath118 is related to the quantum aspect of the problem and to the specific features of wave functions .",
    "the dimension of @xmath118 is @xmath119 rather than length ; that is , it is measured in seconds rather than centimeters .",
    "as @xmath120 and @xmath63 , both correlation lengths diverge at a transition . according to the theory of continuous thermodynamic transitions ,",
    "the divergence is described by power functions ; but the exponents of the two correlation lengths can be different in general .",
    "this is usually written as @xmath121 @xmath122 the exponents @xmath123 and @xmath124 are called critical indices ; @xmath124 is called the dynamic critical index .",
    "both names and designations originate from the theory of thermodynamic processes . in particular , the dynamic critical index in the theory of thermodynamic processes",
    "enters the relation between the lifetime and size of thermal fluctuations , @xmath125 . in the quantum problem at @xmath55 ,",
    "the situation is similar : the length @xmath58 characterizes spatial correlations , i.e. , the characteristic size of quantum fluctuations , and the time @xmath118 characterizes time correlations .",
    "formula ( [ qpt17 ] ) immediately fixes the dimension of the space in which the imaginary classical system should be placed .",
    "a real length must be the coordinate along all axes of this space ; that is , length axes should be made from the @xmath79 axis .",
    "as follows from dimensional considerations and eqn ( [ qpt17 ] ) , the length equivalent to the ` correlation pseudolength ' @xmath118 is proportional to @xmath126 , @xmath127 therefore , the volume element in the space is @xmath128 and a @xmath124-dimensional subspace with the conventional ` spatial ' coordinates appears instead of the one - dimensional imaginary time axis .",

    "the control parameter @xmath56 on the abscissa axis of the @xmath130 plane only affects one independent correlation length , @xmath58 , and @xmath118 ( and the length @xmath131 ) can be formally obtained from @xmath58 using eqn ( [ qpt17 ] ) .",

    "this statement becomes invalid because the conductance depends on the dephasing length and electron  electron scattering changes this length .",
    "nevertheless , if the electron  electron interaction affects the conductance only through scattering , the electron system is considered noninteracting , because the interaction affects the conductance as an external action , e.g. , scattering by phonons .",
    "electron  electron scattering is not the only channel of the effect of the interaction on the conductance .",
    "the interaction is thought to be not the bare coulomb interaction but the interaction between ` dressed ' quasiparticles , i.e. , the screened interaction that depends on the electron density , the diffusion coefficient of electrons , and ( under certain conditions ) the sample size or the quantum coherence length @xcite .",
    "this interaction determines the structure of quantum levels and the ground - state energy , affecting the competition between phases in the vicinity of a phase transition .",

    "[ qpt5 ] is a two - parameter diagram : two parameters are required to specify the flow line of the image point .",

    "we assume that we are at point a in a flow line , that is metallic because it recedes to the region of high conductivity at @xmath63 .",
    "we fix the interaction @xmath315 and vary the conductance @xmath154 ; that is , we vary the degree of disorder .",

    "when moving along this line , we can cross the separatrix and reach point b in a flow line that describes an insulator , because it tends to the point @xmath317 as @xmath63 . to specify the position of a point in line",
    "ab , we can use a single parameter , which is called a control parameter . at another control parameter ,",
    "the angle of intersection of the separatrix can be different .",
    "for example , we can initiate the crossover from a metallic to a nonmetallic flow trajectory by changing the electron concentration and , thus , simultaneously changing the effective interaction @xmath315 and the conductance .    by changing the control parameter",
    ", we can pass from one flow trajectory to another , and , by changing the temperature ( size ) , we can move along a flow trajectory .",
    "but because interaction @xmath315 can change when any of two parameters changes , factorization is absent ; that is , we can not suppose that the length @xmath58 depends only on @xmath59 and the length @xmath141 depends only on temperature .",
    "the consequence of this ` mixing ' of variables is clearly visible in the flow diagram in fig .",
    "[ qpt5 ] . as we move along the separatrix toward the quantum critical point ( qcp ) , the conductance decreases and tends to @xmath182 .",

    "if the tangent to the separatrix is normal to the abscissa axis at the qcp due to any specific reason , the separatrix in the set of temperature dependence has a zero derivative at @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the horizontal position of the separatrix in the set of the temperature dependence of conductivity in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition results from the symmetry of the flow diagram of a certain system and is not an inherent property of all 2d systems .",

    ", we can determine the delocalized - state layer width in units of magnetic field @xmath424 and find that @xmath429 depends linearly on @xmath21 .",
    "this means that @xmath430 in this experiment .",
    "the same value of @xmath241 was obtained earlier in @xcite .",
    "all the considered cases of metal  insulator transitions were found to be adequately described by flow diagrams .",
    "the list of theoretical works that have successfully used this technique begins with work @xcite , where a theoretical model for noninteracting electrons in a zero magnetic field was developed .",
    "the last achievement in this field is the construction of a flow diagram for a 2d model system of interacting electrons and the demonstration of the possibility of a metal  insulator transition in this system .    as regards the general theory of quantum phase transitions , a phase transition in a 3d system of noninteracting electrons demonstrates that , in principle , this theory can be used to describe localized ",
    "delocalized electron transitions .",
    "neither conductance , which is used as a physical quantity specifying the state of the system , nor disorder , which is the main control parameter , are substantial obstacles for this theory .",
    "however , as usual , various particular cases require theoretical versions of various degrees of complexity .",
    "for example , the version described in this review can not be applied to the model proposed in @xcite .    the relative role and possibilities of both theoretical approaches",
    "are demonstrated when the integer quantum hall effect is described . the flow diagram in fig .",
    "[ qpt6 ] is very convenient for the discussion of the types of transitions that are possible in a system and for the formulation of questions to be experimentally checked .",
    "many of these questions are still open .",
    "for example , it is unclear which of the versions of the flow diagram in fig .",
    "[ qpt6 ] is realized in reality and whether the transition between the states with quantum indices @xmath96 and @xmath431 , @xmath432 is split [ @xmath96 is determined by eqn ( [ q202 ] ) ) .",
    "there are also problems related to the topology of the flow diagram . according to fig .",
    "[ qpt6 ] , transitions where quantum number @xmath96 changes by more than unity are impossible @xcite . however , when theorists interpret many experimental data , they state that such transitions occur ( see , e.g. , review @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the general theory of quantum phase transitions does not consider the problem of the relative position of various transitions in the phase plane .",
    "this theory describes the critical vicinity of _ one _ certain transition .",
    "proceeding from the assumptions that ( a ) a transition exists and ( b ) the factorization @xmath433 , @xmath434 occurs in its critical region , the resistivity can be described by eqns ( [ qpt21])([2d - r ] ) ( see sections 2.3 and 5.3 ) .",
    "then , the transition point @xmath52 and critical indices can be determined by processing the @xmath435 curves .",
    "this procedure was performed in paper @xcite , which was discussed in section 6 .",
    "the value of the results obtained in @xcite becomes clear after the questions formulated above and following from flow diagrams are answered .",
