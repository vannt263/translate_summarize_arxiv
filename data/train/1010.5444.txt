    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) is an attempt to make a background independent , non - perturbative quantization of 4-dimensional general relativity ( gr )  for reviews , see @xcite .",
    "it is inspired by the formulation of gr as a dynamical theory of connections @xcite .",
    "starting from this formulation , the kinematics of lqg is well - studied and results in a successful kinematical framework ( see the corresponding chapters in the books @xcite ) , which is also unique in a certain sense @xcite .",
    "however , the framework of the dynamics in lqg is still largely open so far .",
    "there are two main approaches to the dynamics of lqg , they are ( 1 ) the operator formalism of lqg , which follows the spirit of dirac quantization of constrained dynamical system , and performs a canonical quantization of gr @xcite ; ( 2 ) the path integral formulation of lqg , which is currently understood in terms of the spin - foam models ( sfms ) @xcite .",
    "the relation between these two approaches is well - understood in the case of 3-dimensional gravity @xcite , while for 4-dimensional gravity , the situation is much more complicated and there are some attempts @xcite for relating these two approaches .",
    "the present article is concerned with the following issue in the framework of spin - foam models .",
    "the current spin - foam models are mostly inspired by the 4-dimensional plebanski formulation of gr @xcite ( plebanski - holst formulation by including the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath3 ) , whose action reads s_[a , b,]:=(b+*b)^ijf_ij+ d^4x^b^ij_b^kl__ijkl where @xmath4 is a so(4)-valued 2-form field , @xmath5 is the curvature of the so(4)-connection field @xmath6 and @xmath7[{\\gamma}\\delta]}$ ] is a densitized tensor , symmetrized under interchanging @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 $ ] , and traceless @xmath10 . for the illustrative purposes of this article , we consider only euclidean gr in the present article , however , the lessons learnt will extend also to the lorentzian theory .",
    "one can show that the equations of motion implied by the plebanski - holst action are equivalent to the einstein equations of gr .",
    "moreover , if we consider formally the following path integral partition function of the plebanski - holst action and perform the integral of @xmath11 z:=  e^is_[a , b,]=  ( _ ijjklb^ij _ b^kl_-v_/4 ! )  e^i(b+*b)^ijf_ij [ pl ] we obtain the partition function of bf theory @xcite whose paths are , however , constrained by 20 _ simplicity constraint _ equations _ ijjklb^ij_b^kl_-v _",
    "the point of this formulation is of course that the path integral quantization of bf theory has been well - understood in the context of spin - foam models ( see the corresponding chapters in @xcite ) and thus the idea is to rely on those results and to implement the simplicity constraints properly into the partition function of bf theory .",
    "we remark that even for euclidian gravity , the partition function ( [ pl ] ) is unlikely to be derived from the canonical formulation because of the presence of second class constraints which affect the choice of the measure in ( [ pl ] ) , see the first and third reference in @xcite for a detailed discussion . since in current spin foam models the proper choice of measure is also regarded as a technical problem of higher order and as we want to draw attention to a different issue for the current spin foam models , we also will not deal with the measure issue in this article and leave this for future research .",
    "the partition function of bf theory , after discretization on a 4-dimensional simplicial complex @xmath12 and its dual complex @xmath13 , can be expressed as a sum over certain spin - foam amplitudes . here a spin - foam amplitude is obtained by ( 1 ) assigning an so(4 ) unitary irreducible representation to each triangle @xmath14 of @xmath12 ( we label the representation by a pair @xmath15 for each triangle ) ; ( 2 ) assigning a 4-valent so(4 ) intertwiner to each tetrahedron @xmath16 of @xmath12 ( we label the intertwiner by a pair @xmath17 for each tetrahedron )",
    ". then the partition function of bf theory can be written as z_(k)=_\\{j_f^}_f_\\{i^_t}_t_f(j_f^+ ) ( j_f^-)_\\{15j}_(j_f^,i_t^ ) [ bf ] where the @xmath18-symbol is the 4-simplex / vertex amplitude corresponding to the 4-simplex @xmath19 .",
    "the partition function @xmath20 turns out to be independent of the triangulation @xmath12 . clearly , as shown explicitly in eq.([pl ] ) , in order to obtain the partition function for quantum gravity as a sum of spin - foam amplitudes , one has to impose the simplicity constraint in the bf theory measure .",
    "when doing that , the resulting partition function is no longer triangulation independent ( as it should not be because gr is not a tqft ) and thus one should in fact consider all possible triangulations and not only simplicial ones . this is also necessary in order to make contact with the canonical lqg hilbert space which contains all possible graphs and not only 4-valent ones .",
    "this has been recently emphasised in @xcite and the current spin foam models already have been generalised in that respect .",
    "we believe our model also to be generalisable but will not deal with this aspect in the present work as this would draw attention away from our main point .",
    "essentially , the very method of imposing the simplicity constraint _ defines _ the corresponding candidate spin - foam model for quantum gravity which why its proper implementation deserves so much attention .",
    "currently the three most studied spin - foam models for quantum gravity ( in plebanski or plebanski - holst formulation ) are the barrett - crane model @xcite , the eprl model @xcite , and @xmath21 model @xcite .",
    "these three , a priori , different models are defined by three different ways to impose simplicity constraint on the measure of the bf partition function @xmath22 .",
    "we will review these different methods of imposing the simplicity constraint briefly in what follows .",
    "first of all , in the context of the discretized path integral , the simplicity constraint also takes a discretized expression . for each triangle",
    "@xmath14 we define an so(4 ) lie algebra element @xmath23 which corresponds to the integral of the two form @xmath4 over the triangle @xmath14 .",
    "then in terms of the @xmath23 for each 4-simplex @xmath19 the discretised simplicity constraints read & & _ ijklb^ij_fb^kl_f=0 ,  f , f[3simple ] + & & _ ijklb^ij_f_1b^kl_f_1=_ijklb^ij_f_2b^kl_f_2 ,  f_i , f_i [ 4simple ] the barrett - crane model , the eprl model , and the @xmath21 model all explicitly impose the first type of simplicity constraint eq.([3simple ] ) , called tetrahedron constraint , in some way to the spin - foam partition function of bf theory . on the other hand , all of them",
    "replace the second type of simplicity constraint , called 4-simplex constraint eq.([4simple ] ) by the so called _ closure constraint _",
    "_ ftb^ij_f=0   [ closure ]",
    "it is not difficult to see that the closure constraints together with the tetrahedron constraints imply the 4-simplex constraints but not vice versa .",
    "thus , sprictly speaking , imposing the closure constraint constrains the bf measure more than the classical theory would precribe .",
    "it is unknown and also beyond the scope of the present paper whether this replacement is harmless or is in conflict with the classical theory . in this paper ,",
    "as we are merely interested in comparing the standard way of imposing the simplicity constraints ( commuting b fields ) with the non standard methods defining the bc , eprl and fk models ( non commuting b fields ) , we proceed as in those other spin foam models and also replace the 4-simplex constraint by the closure constraint . to distinguish these two different types of constraints , in what follows we use the terminology `` simplicity constraint '' for eq.([3simple ] ) and `` closure constraint '' for eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) .",
    "notice that the bc model , eprl model , and @xmath21 model argue that the closure constraint is `` automatically '' implemented in their spin - foam amplitude .",
    "we will come back to this argument in a moment .",
    "because of that argument , in none of these models the closure constraint is further analysed .",
    "the proper implemementation of the simplicty and closure constraints is one of the most active research areas in the spin foam model community and there are many issues that yet have to be understood @xcite .    for",
    "both the barrett - crane model and eprl model , the strategy for imposing the simplicity constraint is the following : in order to take advantage of the knowledge of bf spin foam model , one formally takes the delta distribution on the b variables out of the integral over b by a standard trick known from ordinary quantum field theories : one ( formally ) just has to replace @xmath4 by @xmath24 because the integrand of the b integral is of the form @xmath25 . due to the discretization upon which @xmath26 is replaced by a holonomy around a face of the dual triangulation and b by an integral over a triangle of the triangulation , @xmath24 can be rewritten in terms of the right invariant vector fields @xmath27 on the copy of @xmath28 corresponding to the given holonomy with holonomy dependent coefficients .",
    "one now argues that these coefficients can be replaced by their chromatic evaluation ( setting the holonomy equal to unity ) because the integration over @xmath4 leads to @xmath29 enforcing the measure on the space of connections to be supported on flat ones .",
    "clearly , this argument is not obviously water tight because @xmath30 may not be supported at @xmath31 .",
    "in fact it should not be if we are interested in gravity rather than bf theory .",
    "see the chapter on spin foams in the second reference of @xcite for more details . in any case , this way of proceeding now leads to replacing the commutative derivations @xmath24 by the non commutative right invariant vector fields @xmath27 .    an alternative argument that has been given is the following : the kinetical boundary hilbert space of the spin foam path integral should be the canonical lqg hilbert space ( restricted to the 4-valent boundary graph of the given simplicial triangulation ) and here the @xmath4 field would be quantised as @xmath32 where @xmath6 is the underlying connection . on functions of holonomies this again becomes a right invariant vector field labelled by the triangles dual ( in the 3d sense ) to the corresponding boundary edges which in turn correspond to the faces of the dual triangulation dual ( in the 4d sense ) to those triangles .",
    "the physical boundary hilbert space should therefore be the kernel of that quantised boundary simplicity constraints . in order to write the corresponding spin foam model",
    ", one has to define the projector on that physical hilbert space . to do this properly , one should canonically quantize plebanski  holst gravity , identify all the first and second class constraints and define the projector via dirac bracket and group averaging which then leads to a spin foam path integral .",
    "how complicated this becomes if one really performs all the necessary steps is outlined in @xcite .",
    "however , this is not what is done in @xcite .",
    "the first observation is that since the spin foam path integral naturally involves so(4 ) , the kinematical boundary hilbert space is naturally also in terms of so(4 ) spin network functions .",
    "one now studies the restrictions that the simplicity constraints impose on the spins and intertwiners of the boundary so(4 ) hilbert space spin network functions .",
    "the detailed structure of these restrictions suggests a natural one to one map with spin network states in the canonical su(2 ) hilbert space .",
    "finally , using locality arguments , one conjectures that these restrictions should not only hold on the boundary but also in the bulk of the bf so(4 ) spin foam model .",
    "see @xcite for a particularly simple and clear exposition of this procedure .",
    "it has recently been criticised in @xcite on the ground that the bf symplectic structure and the lqg symplectic structure have wrongly been identified in the afore mentioned identification map .    in any case , whether or not the map is the correct correpondence , the simplicity constraints were again quantised as non commuting ( anomalous ) constraints .",
    "if one understands the kernel in the strong operator topology then one obtains the bc model , if one understands it in the weak operator topology ( gupta  bleuler procedure ) one obtains the eprl model .",
    "because of the anomaly , imposing the constraint operators strongly apparently makes the barrett - crane model lose some important information about non - degenerate quantum geometry @xcite . imposing the constraints weakly is less restrictive and thus may lead to a better behaved model .",
    "more in detail , first of all the quadratic expression of the simplicity constraint eq.([3simple ] ) is replaced by a linearized expression .",
    "it is given by asking that for each tetrahedron @xmath16 , there exists a unit vector @xmath33 , such that b_f^iju_t , i=0[lsc ] the equivalence of the linearized simplicity constraint eq.([lsc ] ) with original simplicity constraint eq.([3simple ] ) will be reviewed in section [ implementation ] ( in the gravitational sector of the solution ) .",
    "in the original construction of eprl spin - foam model in @xcite , the unit vector @xmath33 is gauge fixed to be @xmath34 , and a `` master constraint '' @xmath35 is defined ( to replace the cross - diagonal part of the simplicity constraint eq.([3simple ] ) ) , where @xmath36 from eq.([lsc ] ) .",
    "the corresponding `` master constraint operator '' is defined by replacing @xmath37 by right invariant derivatives .",
    "this master constraint solves the problem of non - commutativity / anomaly of the quantum simplicity to a certain extent , because a single master constraint replaces all the cross - diagonal components of eq.([3simple ] ) .",
    "moreover the diagonal part of eq.([3simple ] ) and this master constraint operator restrict the hilbert space spanned by the 4-valent so(4 ) spin - networks to its subspace , which can be identified with 4-valent su(2 ) spin - networks and thus can be imbedded into the kinematical hilbert space of lqg . for each of these su(2 ) spin - networks , the su(2 ) unitary irreducible representations labelled by @xmath38 has the following relation with the original so(4 ) representations on all the boundary edges dual to the boundary triangles j^=k[jk ] here the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath3 can only take discrete values , i.e.  ||>1 : & & = +  ||<1 : & & = more importantly , the recent results in @xcite show that the boundary hilbert space used in the eprl model solves the linear version of simplicity constraint eq.([lsc ] ) ( and the closure constraint eq.([closure ] ) ) weakly , i.e. the matrix elements ( with respect to the boundary so(4 ) hilbert space ) of the constraint operators vanish on the space of solutions f ,",
    "f=0 ,   in contrast to the strong implementation of the constraints in the barrett - crane model .",
    "finally the ( euclidean ) eprl spin - foam partition function is expressed by z_(k)=_\\{k_f}_f_\\{i_t}_t_f(k_f ) _ _",
    "i_t^\\{15j}_(j_f^,i_t^)_f^i_t_i^+_t , i^-_t(j^_f , k_f ) where for each spin - foam amplitude , an su(2 ) unitary irreducible representation @xmath39 is assigned to each triangle @xmath14 , satisfying the relation eq.([jk ] ) , and an su(2 ) 4-valent intertwiner @xmath40 is assigned to each tetrahedron @xmath16 . here _",
    "i_t^\\{15j}_(j_f^,i_t^)_f^ i_t_i^+_t , i^-_t(j^_f , k_f ) is the 4-simplex / vertex amplitude for the eprl model , where @xmath41 are a fusion coefficients defined in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath21 model follows a different strategy to impose the simplicity constraint , namely by using the coherent states for su(2 ) group @xcite .",
    "given a unitary irreducible representation space @xmath42 of su(2 ) , the coherent state is defined by |j , n:=n|j ,",
    "j=_m =- j^j|j , m^j_mj(n )  n",
    "we then immediately have the resolution of identity on @xmath42 1_j=(j)_su(2)dn  |j , nj , n|[ri ] this coherent state has a certain geometrical interpretation , which can be seen by computing the expectation value of the su(2 ) generator ( @xmath43 are pauli matrices ) [ interpretation ] j , n||j , n = j , n|^i|j , n_i = jn_3n^-1[expect ] if we identify the lie algebra su(2 ) with @xmath44 , we can see that the coherent state @xmath45 describes a vector in @xmath44 with length @xmath46 , its direction is determined by the action of @xmath47 on a unit reference vector ( the direction of @xmath48 ) . from the expression @xmath49 we see that @xmath47 can be parameterized by the coset @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , the integral in the resolution of identity is essentially over @xmath50 .",
    "it is not hard to show that the ( euclidean ) bf partition function can be expressed in terms of the coherent states ( we write @xmath51 for each so(4 ) element , @xmath52 for an so(4 ) unitary irreducible representation ) z_(k)&=&_\\{j_f^}_f_f(j^+_f)(j^-_f)_(,t)dg^+ _ tdg^-_t + & & _ ( t , f)(j^+_f)(j^-_f)dn^+_tfdn^-_tf_(f)j^+_f , n_tf^+    where @xmath53 is a so(4 ) holonomy along the edge from the center of 4-simplex @xmath19 to the center of tetrahedron @xmath16 .",
    "then the strategy of imposing simplicity constraint in @xmath54 model is to use the interpretation ( [ interpretation ] ) of the coherent state labels @xmath55 as the self - dual / anti - self - dual part @xmath56 of the so(4 ) variable @xmath57 associated with a triangle @xmath14 seen from a tetrahedron @xmath16 .",
    "( more precisely , we know that the previously defined @xmath23 can be decomposed into self - dual and anti - self - dual part @xmath58 .",
    "the _ interpretations _ of @xmath59 , @xmath56 are considered as the parallel transport of @xmath58 from the center of triangle @xmath14 to the center of tetrahedron @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the holonomy along the edge from the center of triangle @xmath14 to the center of tetrahedron @xmath16 ) .",
    "that is , the simplicity constraint is imposed on the coherent state labels , which results in the following restrictions : [ restriction ] = || ,   \\ {    ll ( n^+_tf , n^-_tf)=(n_tfh__tf , u_tn_tfh^-1__tf ) , & + ( n^+_tf , n^-_tf)=(n_tfh__tf , u_tn_tfh^-1__tf ) , &    . where @xmath62 is some normal to @xmath16 , @xmath63 takes values in the u(1 ) subgroup of su(2 ) generated by @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in more detaiul ,",
    "the proposal is then to simply replace in ( [ bf1 ] ) @xmath66 by these expressions and the haar measure @xmath67 by the haar measure @xmath68 .",
    "we emphasize that this is an interesting but non standard procedure : while the identification of the coherent state labels @xmath69 with the so(4 ) variables @xmath57 is certainly well motivated , the resulting expression does not arise by integrating out the @xmath4 fields in the presence of the delta distributions enforcing the simplicit constraints .",
    "rather , in ( [ bf1 ] ) the b fields have already been integrated out .",
    "to restrict measure and integrand by hand afterwards according to ( [ restriction ] ) is not obviously equivalent with the standard procedure of solving the @xmath70distributions .",
    "one would hope that the resulting procedures coincide in the semiclassical or the `` large-@xmath46 '' limit @xcite .",
    "indeed , the `` large-@xmath46 '' limit result in section [ nsf ] will support this expectation .",
    "finally the spin - foam partition function of @xmath21 model coincides ( at least up to a slight change of edge amplitude ) with eprl partition function when the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath71 .",
    "however when @xmath72 or @xmath73 , @xmath21 partition function is rather different from the eprl partition function . here",
    "we only show explicitly the 4-simplex / vertex amplitude of @xmath21 model when @xmath72 or @xmath73 _",
    "i_t^\\{15j}_(j_f^,i_t^)_f^ i_t_i^+_t , i^-_t(j^_f , k_tf ) here although the relation between @xmath74 = || is the same as in eprl model , in @xmath21 model for @xmath72 or @xmath73 , there are some additional degrees of freedom associated with the label @xmath75 , which are the values of spins from the coupling of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath75 could take values in @xmath78 .",
    "the final partition function is obtained by summing over @xmath77 , @xmath40 , and @xmath75 with some measure factors ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "+   +   + in the previous three paragraphs , we briefly revisited the main strategies of imposing simplicity constraint in barrett - crane , eprl and @xmath21 models .",
    "we have seen that these in general different spin - foam models came from two different ways of imposing simplicity constraint , i.e. barrett - crane and eprl model quantize the simplicity constraint as operators and imposed them ( strongly or weakly ) on the boundary spin - networks , while @xmath21 model imposes the constraint on the coherent state labels . however , as we have reviewd , none of the three models is derived from the original path integral formula eq.([pl ] ) of the plebanski action ( or the discretized version of the path integral ) without using some non standard methods .",
    "therefore a natural question arises : + is any of those three spin - foam models consistent with the path integral formula eq.([pl ] ) and its discretized version ?",
    "this question is non trivial because in all three types of models one deals with non commutative b fields and simplicity constraints as operators on some hilbert space while the original path integral is in terms of commutative c - number variables so that anomalies can not arise . because of this issue , it is interesting to investigate what kind of spin - foam model we will obtain , if we start from the ( discretization of ) the path integral formula eq.([pl ] ) with commutative @xmath1 variables .",
    "it is also interesting to find some possible bridges linking the ( discretization of ) the path integral formula eq.([pl ] ) with commutative @xmath1 variables to the existing spin - foam models using non - commutative @xmath1 variables .    in this article",
    ", we consider the discretization of the path integral formula eq.([pl ] ) , which will be eq.([start ] ) .",
    "as announced in @xcite , in contrast to the barrett - crane , eprl , and @xmath21 models , we always consider the variables @xmath1 as commutative c - numbers .",
    "the simplicity constraint ( and closure constraint ) is ( are ) imposed by the c - number delta functions inserted in the path integral formula , which one gets by integrating over the lagrange multiplier and which constrain the path integral measure . in our concrete analysis in section [ nsf ] ,",
    "the most important difference between our derivation and the derivation in any of barrett- crane , eprl , and @xmath21 models is the following : in any of barrett - crane , eprl , and @xmath54 models , one always imposes the respective version of the simplicity constraint constraint on the bf spin - foam partition function eq.([bf ] ) or ( [ bf1 ] ) _ after _ integration over @xmath1 .",
    "this feature is essentially the reason why it is difficult to find a relation between the simplicity constraint imposed in any of barrett - crane , eprl , and @xmath21 models and the simplicity constraint in the path integral formula eq.([pl ] ) .",
    "by contrast , our derivation in section [ nsf ] will _ not _ start from the spin - foam partition function of bf theory , but instead we impose the delta function of the simplicity constraint ( and closure constraint ) before the integration over @xmath1 , and we will see that solving these constraints gives rise to a non trivial modification of the path integral measure .    as also announced in @xcite ,",
    "regarding the @xmath1 variables as commutative c - numbers also makes the treatment of closure constraint different .",
    "we know that the closure constraint eq.([closure ] ) is necessary in order that the full set of simplicity constraint eq.([3simple ] ) and ( [ 4simple ] ) is satisfied . in barrett - crane model the closure constraint is argued to be automatically satisfied by the so(4 ) gauge invariance of the vertex amplitude .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , this is only true _",
    "after _ performing the haar measure integrals which essentially project everything on the gauge invariant sector .",
    "it is clear that the closure constraint must be imposed _ before _ performing the integral over the connections . in the eprl model ,",
    "the argument is improved in that both simplicity constraint and closure constraint vanishes _ weakly _ on the eprl boundary hilbert space @xcite . moreover , in @xcite , it is shown that in both eprl and @xmath21 model , the closure constraint can be implemented in terms of geometric quantization and by the commutativity of the quantization and phase space reduction @xcite .",
    "as defined , an additional closure constraint would be redundant for both eprl and @xmath21 model , since they are already on the constraint surface of closure constraint ( if one interpret the coherent state labels to be the @xmath1 variables ) , although the original definitions of both models did nt impose closure constraint explicitly .",
    "we feel that this is again due to the fact that the haar integrals have already been performed .",
    "in our analysis we find that the implementation of closure constraint gives non - trivial restrictions on the measure .    in order to understand what happens",
    "when one ignores the clsoure constraint and to follow more closely the procedure followed by existing spin foam models , in section [ nsf ] , we first consider a simplified partition function @xmath79 in which the delta functions of closure constraint is dropped , and derive an expression of @xmath80 as a sum of all possible spin - foam amplitudes ( constrained only by the simplicity constraints ) .",
    "then we compare with the full partition function @xmath81 with the delta functions for closure constraint implemented , and we find the delta functions of closure constraint non - trivially affect the spin - foam expression of partition function .",
    "surprisingly , all the spin - foams ( transition channels ) admitted in the simplified partition function @xmath79 also contribute to the full partition function @xmath81 ( with some changes for the triangle / face amplitude and tetrahedron / edge amplitude ) .",
    "+   + another key feature of our derivation is a different discretization of the bf action .",
    "here we first break the faces dual to the triangles into wedges ( see fig.[face ] ) and then write the discretized bf action in terms of the holonomies along the boundary of the wedges . here , as usual , a wedge in the dual face @xmath14 is determined by a dual vertex or original 4-simplex @xmath82 and thus denoted by @xmath83 .",
    "its boundary consists of four segments defined as follows : the original ( piecewise linear ) 4-simplex has a barycentre @xmath84 which is the dual vertex .",
    "the dual edges connect these barycentres .",
    "a pair of dual edges @xmath85 adjacent to the same dual vertex defines a face .",
    "conversely , given a face and a dual vertex which is one of the corners of the face , we obtain two dual edges .",
    "these are dual to two tetrahedra @xmath86 of the original complex .",
    "the boundary of the wedge @xmath83 is now given by @xmath87 where the hat denotes the respective barycentres . in an unfortunate abuse of notation which exploits the duality one also writes this as @xmath88 .",
    "using this notation we have ( cf .",
    "fig.[face ] ) & & _ m [ b+*b]^ijf_ij  =  _ m(1+)(x^+f^+ ) + _ m(1-)(x^-f^- ) + & = & _",

    "this starting point results in some new structures in the resulting spin - foams :    * in contrast to the existing spin - foam models , where the so(4 ) representations @xmath15 were labeling the faces @xmath14 , the new spin - foam model derived in section [ nsf ] have so(4 ) representations @xmath91 labeling the wedges , i.e. a dual face @xmath14 having @xmath47 vertices ( corners ) in general has @xmath47 different pairs @xmath91 , one for each wedge determined by the vertex dual to @xmath19 .",
    "however in the large-@xmath46 limit , the triangle/ face amplitude is concentrated on so(4 ) representations @xmath92 for any vertices @xmath93 of the same face @xmath14 . * two neighboring wedges @xmath90 and @xmath94 of a face @xmath14 share a segment @xmath95 ( c.f .",
