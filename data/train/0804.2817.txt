    "effective - medium approximations ( emas ) for nonlinear composites@xcite ( i.e. , multi - phase materials ) , which aim to predict their overall ( i.e. , macroscopic ) behavior , are pushed to their limits of validity as the nonlinearity and/or the heterogeneity contrast become large.@xcite typical examples of this sort of phenomenon in continuum mechanics include porous,@xcite and rigidly reinforced,@xcite plastic or nonlinearly elastic media . in the idealized model of perfect plasticity , plastic material flow takes place at constant stress intensity ( the yield stress ) . in such circumstances ,",
    "the flow preferentially concentrates ( _ localizes _ ) in _ shear bands_. @xcite formally , these shear bands are closely related to other types of minimal breakdown manifolds in heterogeneous media ( mechanical systems as well as nonlinear electrical networks).@xcite however , nonlinear emas which address plasticity rely on a quasi - equilibrium hypothesis , which means that the characteristic time of an individual `` breakdown '' ( or slip ) event is longer than that of wave propagation through the medium@xcite ( in nonlinear dielectrics , such conditions are met as well in the reversible diode network experiment@xcite ) .",

    "to address this issue , this paper is devoted to the signature of incipient localization in an ema for periodic composites.@xcite because for periodic media efficient methods of solution have been developed,@xcite our focus here is on such materials .",
    "thus , a system consisting of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic lattice of voids embedded in a deformable matrix is considered . aimed at understanding the hallmarks of localization in the underlying linear medium of nonlinear emas , we focus on the case of an elastically anisotropic _ linear _ matrix , of variable anisotropy.@xcite    the problem , described in sec .",

    "the flow pattern is organized in closed convection cells of square shape , delimited by black boxes .",
    "two types of cells , rotated 45@xmath131 with respect to the cartesian axes , and related by a mirror symmetry , suffice to account for the flow pattern in ss ( maps a , b , c ) .",
    "as a consequence , and due to the high anisotropy , the edges of the unit cells in ( a ) and ( c ) undergo non - zero and quasi piecewise - linear deformation . on the other hand ,",
    "four types of convection cells , aligned along the cartesian axes , related by mirror symmetries with respect to these axes , and fully enclosed within one unit cell , are required to produce the flow pattern in ps ( d , e , f ) .",
    "compared to the @xmath66 isotropic solutions of ( b ) and ( e ) , solutions for highly anisotropic situations are either : ( i ) _ localized in strain _ , with a displacement field discontinuous at places [ maps ( c ) and ( d ) ] ; ( ii ) _ localized in stress _ , with continuous displacement as in ( a ) and ( f ) .",
    "strain - localization arises whenever loading along a `` hard '' mode takes place .",
    "then , the highly anisotropic medium resists most the applied strain and undergoes both a high induced stress and a weak induced strain . in the limit of infinite anisotropy , a rigid `` block sliding '' incipient pattern results , where the flow is organized in bands of width one void diameter ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : bands ] ) , where the tangential component of @xmath132 is discontinuous , and where strain concentrates as dirac distributions along the sliding lines .",
    "this pattern is tantamount to a breakdown mechanism . in turn , block sliding leaves four incipient voids in the matrix in ( c ) and ( d ) , at locations where the sliding lines intersect at 90@xmath133 .",
    "one such void is enlarged in ( d ) . one important difference between cases ( c ) and ( d ) is that in ( c ) , the flow bands ( of width one void diameter ) cross inside the matrix due to their 45@xmath133 orientation . flow redistribution then takes place in the intersection zones . on the contrary , in ( d )",
    "such zones do not exist in the matrix , and flow redistribution requires a non - zero displacement component normal to the band boundaries . as a result , the gradient of the tangential component of @xmath132 is higher in ( c ) than in ( d ) .",
    "solutions with a continuous displacement field are obtained instead when loading is applied along the soft deformation mode . the remaining deformation mode being harder ,",
    "this leaves less possibilities for easy deformation than in the isotropic case ; this explains why the unit cells of ( a ) and ( f ) are much less deformed  a magnification @xmath134 is used  than the cells ( b ) and ( e ) of the isotropic material  plotted with @xmath135 .",
    "table [ maps : ss ] displays , for @xmath129 and for increasing anisotropy ratios @xmath86 , maps of the independent stress components @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , under ss and ps loadings .",
    "hereafter , the maps are referred to by their individual number ( 1 to 30 ) .",
    "each map goes along with its own field scale at its right , in correspondence with the color scale at the extreme right of the rows .",
    "the `` parallel '' ( @xmath139 ) and `` perpendicular '' ( @xmath140 ) notations refer to the `` direction '' of the applied macroscopic loading .",
    "the ss and ps shear components of the stress are defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomp ] ) . in ps loading",
    ", we have @xmath141 , @xmath142 , whereas in ss loading : @xmath143 , @xmath144 ( herafter , a similar notation is used for strain components ) .",
    "in both cases , the volume average of the non - parallel components vanish : @xmath145 .",
    "the maps display rescaled stresses , such that @xmath146 .",
    "due to linearity , the strain fields are the same , up to a change of scale ( although the scales are different in the parallel and perpendicular directions due to the anisotropy ) .",
    "the following observations are relevant to the regime of high anisotropy , where the stress patterns follow that of fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] .",
    "the zones where bands cross depicted in this figure [ either in the matrix ( zones _ c _ ) or close to the voids ( zones _ _ d__+_v _ ) ] , are places of additive screening or enhancement of the stress .",
    "thus , the parallel stress in zone _ c _ of map 20 reaches its highest values there , and is twice that in the two crossing bands ( however , a much higher transverse stress is encountered in the immediate vicinity of the void , see map 25 ) . in a similar way ,",
    "the vanishing stress in zone _ c _ in map 5 is the difference between the stresses in the bands .",
    "two remarks , strictly valid for infinite anisotropy , are in order at this point : first , zones of vanishing stress are squares , of size determined by the void cross section transverse to the bands , so that the disk - like shape of the voids is no longer relevant ; second , the build - up of zones of zero stresses ( i.e. , analogous to porous zones ) in the matrix in ss loading leads to an effective doubling of the porosity in the effective shear modulus @xmath81 at infinite anisotropy , whereby an effective `` close packing '' threshold , twice as small as the geometric one,@xcite is reached as @xmath0 increases , leading to a `` mechanically advanced '' percolative behavior . as a consequence , @xmath81 decays rapidly with @xmath0 , see next section .",
    "the stress is less singular than the strain in the limit of infinite anisotropy .",
    "indeed , in a strain - localized situation ( loading along a `` hard '' mode [ maps 5 , 16 ] ) , the displacement is discontinuous . accordingly , the transverse strain has dirac singular components along the band frontiers .",
    "they abruptly change sign at the special points @xmath147 and @xmath148 on the void boundary in ps and at points @xmath149 in ss , where @xmath22 is the void radius .",
    "because of the stress - strain proportionality , these strain singularities can be traced in maps 10 and 21 . however , since the perpendicular stress vanishes in the limits @xmath121 , so do its dirac singularities , as shown by the small values on the scales .",
    "the special points , termed _",
    "hot spots _ in ref .",
    "are points of extreme matter separation , or crushing , which bear the main cost of the `` block sliding '' patterns . on the other hand , the incipient secondary voids in maps ( c ) and ( d ) of tab .",
    "[ tab : displacement ] appear ( somehow paradoxically ) as regions of moderate stress levels .",
    "more generally , the stress field undergoes the following types of singular behavior in the limiting cases of infinite anisotropy : +  _ loading along a hard mode : _ discontinuous @xmath137 component along band frontiers in the direction normal to the frontiers , with finite jump , accompanied by hot spots at the void boundary [ maps 5 , 16 ] ; +  _ loading along a soft mode : _ discontinuous derivative of @xmath137 in the same direction , with infinite jump [ maps 1 , 20 ] , and discontinuous @xmath138 with infinite jump across the band frontiers ( case of loading along a soft mode ) [ maps 6 , 25 ] .",
    "+ the mean stress is always singular with the most singular behavior : it has the singularity of the parallel stress in the case of loading along a soft mode , and the singularity of the transverse stress in the case of loading along a hard mode ( but the mean strain vanishes in the limit of an incompressible medium ) .",
    "nemat - nasser proposed@xcite an approximate ( dipolar ) fourier - mode approach to the periodic problem , which proved excellent for isotropic components.@xcite we apply it to the anisotropic case .",
    "more accurate schemes going beyond the dipolar level , however less suitable to analytical treatment , are available.@xcite    the approach is as follows . consider first the general case of a binary composite of volume @xmath150 , the inclusions of which have an elastic tensor @xmath151 , and set @xmath152 .",

    "analogous properties are found under ps loading , provided that @xmath86 is replaced by @xmath362 : e.g. , @xmath349 is a decreasing function of @xmath86 and blows up in the hard loading mode as @xmath363 when @xmath364 .",

    "the quantity @xmath342 changes from a concave to a convex function of @xmath0 .",
    "such a change also occurs at @xmath368 for the same sds when @xmath291 and ps loading is applied .",
    "fft field maps then indicate that the structure of the strain pattern also undergoes an abrupt change at this point ( with the appearance of thinner strips linking closest neighboring voids  not shown ) .          for completeness , we include the standard deviations in the dilute limit ( of relevance to nonlinear emas ) computed from the hs - ema .    for ss loading ,",
    "we find for @xmath369 ( low anisotropy or low porosity ) ,    @xmath370    where the @xmath2 proportionality of the sds goes along `` classical '' @xmath4 dilute corrections to the effective moduli . in limits of infinite anisotropy , where necessarily @xmath371 , the hs estimates provide :    @xmath372    while exact results read:@xcite    @xmath373    for ps loading , the hs - ema gives for @xmath369 :    @xmath374    for infinite anisotropy where @xmath371 , the hs estimates provide :    @xmath375    while exact results are:@xcite    @xmath376    thus , the hs - ema correctly reproduces the scaling behavior of the sds in all cases .",
    "to summarize , we compared the results of the hs - ema to fft calculations , and showed that the agreement is excellent , even in the non - trivial case of localizing behavior , as far as effective moduli and averaged fields are concerned , and provided that the void concentration lies below @xmath377 .",
    "this result is relevant to the study of _ non - linear _ effective - medium techniques : the latter involving both an anisotropic ema , and a specific self - consistent linearization procedure ( which determines the effective anisotropy of the former ) , the present study shows that should strong deviations between fft and ema results in nonlinear media be observed ( in the similar set - up of a periodic voided medium , and in similar conditions of porosity and of effective anisotropy ) , they ought be attributed to the linearization procedure rather than to the underlying liner ema , even in limits of high effective anisotropy ( determined by the field fluctuations in the nonlinear theory ) .",
    "also , the present work provides a useful independent confirmation of the involved analytical analysis of ref ..    as a by - product of the study , of possible practical applications , we showed that by combining a regular lattice of voids ( which makes the structure lighter ) and an anisotropic matrix , properties could be tuned so as to make the overall medium elastically isotropic in plane strain .",
    "we also studied analytically the lattice sums which underly the ema approach , and showed that they possess a scaling property which , in the dilute limit of small porosity and at high ( but finite ) anisotropy , allows for a cross - over between regular and singular porosity dependence of the effective medium .",
    "a length scale @xmath313 was associated to this scaling , and interpreted as an effective heterogeneity size .",
    "it mathematically diverges in the limit of infinite anisotropy .",
    "however , its physically associated counterpart being constrained by the finite size of the cell in the periodic medium , cross - over occurs when the effective heterogeneities `` percolate '' , i.e.  when @xmath313 is trivially of order one .",
    "this corresponds to a strongly correlated regime of strain localization bands spanning the system .    actually , scaling properties of lattice sums similar to the one considered here ,",
    "have already been pointed out by barber,@xcite elaborating on hall s work,@xcite in a purely mathematical context ( in particular , no explanation in terms of length scales was given ) . here",
    ", we make a connection between this phenomenon and strain localization in anisotropic elastic media .",
    "barber s paper also provides a means to compute the cross - over function .",
    "our lattice sums lead to technical difficulties which preclude the straightforward obtention of a similar result , and we leave this issue for future work .",
    "moreover , we found that under loading in a  hard \" direction of the anisotropic medium , standard deviations of the transverse strain component blow up continuously as a power of the anisotropy ratio , as though the system remained in a cross - over regime .",
    "this absence of finite threshold for diverging fluctuations , and the above - described behavior , suggest the existence of a special type of continuous phase transition , of infinite order ( called a `` weak phase transition '' by hall,@xcite ) , here obviously without symmetry breaking .",
    "the presence of logarithmic terms in @xmath86 ( identified numerically in the appendix ) also hints in this direction , since logarithmic corrections to scaling constitute a hallmark of transitions of infinite order.@xcite however , a random version of the system should be investigated before reaching definite conclusions .",
    "finally , it was observed in ref .   that the singular effective moduli in the limit of infinite anisotropy are directly connected to the hyperbolic character of the governing equations in this limit .",
    "the very existence of a cross - over shows without ambiguity that the problem , although elliptic from a strict mathematical point of view , presents a `` quasi - hyperbolic '' character at short distances for high but finite anisotropy .",
    "this observation may be of relevance to theoretical investigations of granular materials , for which a model with a similar anisotropic matrix has been proposed.@xcite    the work of m.i.i .  and p.p.c .  was supported by nsf grant cms-02 - 01454 .",

    "one privileged tool for exact asymptotic expansions is the mellin transform.@xcite the transform and its inverse are defined by : @xmath399&=&\\int_0^\\infty { \\text{d}}x\\ , x^{z-1}f(x),\\\\ f(x)&=&\\frac{1}{2i\\pi}\\int_{c - i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty } { \\text{d}}z\\ , x^{-z } m[f(x);z],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath400 lies within the analyticity strip ( parallel to the imaginary axis ) of @xmath401 $ ] in the @xmath402-plane . shifting the inversion contour to the left encircles the poles on the negative @xmath402 axis and provides the asymptotic series expansion around @xmath403 in positive powers of @xmath404 .",
