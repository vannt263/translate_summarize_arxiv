    "over the recent years , impressive progress has been made in understanding of the physics of dna . to a large extent",
    ", this development was due to the introduction of novel micromanipulation techniques suitable for study of the mechanical response of a single molecule @xcite@xcite .",
    "the mechanical properties of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) have been studied in pioneering experiments of smith et al @xcite .",
    "these experiments agree remarkably well with worm - like chain ( wlc ) model which describes dna as an elastic rod , whose bending modulus is proportional to chain persistence length @xmath0 ( @xmath1 for dsdna , which is the only adjustable parameter of the model ) @xcite .    in the case of",
    "single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) and rna molecules the choice of an adequate elastic description remains an open problem .",
    "on the one hand , ssdna and rna were traditionally described by freely joint chain model ( fjc ) .",
    "its extensible version has been originally used for fitting of the early ssdna stretching data @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the chemical structure of ssdna strongly support the picture with a finite bending modulus , reminiscent of wlc model .",
    "however , being a continuous model , the wlc description is unlikely to be valid in the regimes when discrete nature of chemical bonds becomes relevant ( e.g. for a sufficiently high stretching force ) . to overcome these limitations ,",
    "discreet persistent chian ( dpc ) model has been proposed for ssdna by storm and nelson dpcnels .",
    "interestingly , wlc itself was introduced as a continuous limit of a similar discrete model , originally proposed back in late 40s by kratky and porod ( kp ) @xcite .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite  succeeded in calculating the response of dpc to an arbitrary stretching force , by combining the transfer matrix method with a variational procedure .",
    "nevertheless , the discreet model yields only a marginal improvement of the fit of ssdna force  extension curve , compared to wlc and fjc cases .    in order to improve the fitting ,",
    "the extensible versions of the above models are typically used , i.e. the linear deformations of the bonds are introduced .",
    "however , the afm experiments done in the limit of very high force ( up to 1000 pn ) @xcite , exhibit surprising saturation of the end - to - end distance at certain value _ above _ the chain counter length .",
    "any model which treat deformations of the ssdna backbone in a linear manner , is unable to capture this phenomenon .",
    "the experimental behavior is however consistent with results of detailed _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple model motivated by actual microscopic architecture of ssdna . without introduction of extra fitting parameters , our `` zigzag '' model adequately describe both low- and high - force regimes of ssdna stretching .",
    "discreet persistent chian ( dpc ) , also known as kratky and porod ( kp ) model , has the following hamiltonian :    @xmath2    \\label{dpc}\\ ] ]    here @xmath3 , is @xmath4-th bond orientation , @xmath5 is ( fixed ) bond length , @xmath6 is the angle between @xmath7 and @xmath8-th bonds ( i.e cos @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 is external stretching force .  interestingly , two other common models can be obtained from dpc  hamiltonian , by taking limits of zero bond length ( wlc ) , or zero coupling @xmath11 ( fjc ) .        at the atomistic level , the backbone conformation of ssdna is often parameterized by several torsional angles per nucleotide , as shown in figure [ torsion ] . from this point of view , wlc and",
    "dpc models describe small deviations from the ground state configuration .",
    ". however , at the microscopical level , all the valent angles have certain preferred values different from 180@xmath12 . the minimal generalization of dpc model which mimics",
    "this observation is a chain whose ground state is zigzag ( all - trans ) configuration : @xmath13 .\\]]here @xmath14 is the torsional angle associated with rotation of @xmath7 bond . for simplicity",
    ", we assign the same preferred angle @xmath15 to each bond pair . surprisingly , this minimal model results in a significant improvement over the previous attempts to describe the experimentally observed large force behavior of ssdna .",
    "in order to calculate the stretching curve of the `` zigzag '' chain , we note that the model can be mapped back onto dpc model , with renormalized parameters .",
    "let us consider a chain consisting only of odd ( or only even ) nodes of the zigzag ( i.e. ... @xmath16 ... ) .",
    "the ground state of this chain is a straight line , but the bond length ( even without thermal fluctuation ) is a function of applied force : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the preferred bond orientation angle @xmath19 , with respect to the direction of @xmath20 . in ground state configuration",
    "( i.e. zigzag ) @xmath21  the value of @xmath22 may be obtained by minimizing the hamiltonian , at given stretching force : @xmath23\\]]in the limit of small @xmath15 , we obtain::@xmath24@xmath25    it is also easy to demonstrate that the renormalized coupling in the final dpc hamiltonian will be @xmath26",
    ". the parameters of the renormalized model are related to the experimentally observable persistence length as @xmath27 .",
    "we can now use dpc model to calculate the stretching curve @xmath28 , and include the effect of renormalization in the following manner : @xmath29 \\frac{\\theta _ { 0}^{2}}{8}% \\right ) x\\left ( f\\right)\\]]here @xmath30 and @xmath31 are end - to - end distance and the original chain counter length , respectively . since the discreetness  of dpc is only marginally important",
    ", one can relate @xmath32 to @xmath33 with a simple interpolation formula proposed by marko and siggia for continuous wlc model:@xmath34        the resulting stretching curve is shown in figure [ zigzag ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the very good fit can be achieved with the same number of free parameters , as in the earlier models : @xmath5(which is fixed at its physical value of a typical chemincal bond length , @xmath35 ) , ssdna persistence length @xmath36 ( extracted from the moderate force stretching behavior ) .",
    "the only fitting in our model is angle @xmath37 which essentially  replaces the bond rigidity commonly used in the extensible versions of classical models .",
    "in conclusion , we proposed a new model for ssdna elasticity .",
    "it differs from the earlier ones by an explicit account for certain features of microscopic architecture of the chain backbone .",
    "qualitatively , our  model attribute the ultra - high - force stretching behavior to the perturbations to the valent angles rather than deformations of the bonds themselves .",
    "this implication can be directly checked by the first principle calculations ."
