    "the path towards quantum gravity opened a territory full of surprises : quantum field theory in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "bekenstein s phenomenological thermodynamics of black holes @xcite received a strong support from hawking , when he found that a black hole must emit thermal radiation @xcite .",
    "the discovery hinted that thermal effects might appear without any underlying stochasticity .",
    "fulling , davies , and unruh proposed that a similar effect existed in an essentially flat spacetime , i.e. , rindler spacetime : an accelerated observer through an empty minkowski spacetime will perceive a thermal bath of particles , at a temperature proportional to its acceleration @xcite . both phenomena are intimately related : in both cases , an event horizon , which prevents communication between different regions of spacetime , is developed .",
    "furthermore , in order to observe hawking s radiation one must stay at rest near a black hole , and therefore feel an acceleration .",
    "a further surprise was revealed when takagi studied the relation between dimensionality and the unruh thermal spectrum @xcite . in 3 + 1d ,",
    "an accelerated detector of bosonic particles in minkowski spacetime will record a bose - einstein distribution , and a detector of fermionic particles will find a fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "but this is only true if the dimension of space is odd . otherwise , an apparent _ statistics inversion _ phenomenon takes place : bosons are detected with a fermi - dirac distribution , while fermions are detected with a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the unruh effect is not just an exotic curiosity : it bears a deep relation to entanglement @xcite and black hole thermodynamics , and it plays a central role in jacobson s derivation of einstein equations as equations of state for spacetimes in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these results point to a fundamental nature of the unruh effect as a quantum counterpart of the principle of equivalence , which it corrects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the unruh effect can be regarded as a particular case of _ parametric amplification _ of the vacuum fluctuations @xcite , which puts it in the same class of phenomena as the dynamical casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the latter can be seen as a flat spacetime analog of the hawking effect and connected with the unruh thermal bath close to the black hole horizon .",
    "the intriguing relation between the unruh and dynamical casimir effects has been also explored in the context of brane physics @xcite .",
    "the fundamental relevance of the unruh effect provides a strong motivation to measure it and related phenomena in the laboratory @xcite ( see also @xcite for some more recent proposals ) .",
    "given the difficulty of the task , a different approach has been to develop analogue gravity systems where hawking radiation might show up @xcite .",
    "one of the first ideas @xcite was to build a _",
    "sonic analogue _ of a black hole in a moving medium , whose speed of sound replaces the speed of light . if the relative velocity between parts of the propagating medium is larger than the speed of sound , an effective horizon appears",
    ". the medium can be either water @xcite or a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , which can be employed also to probe the dynamical casimir effect @xcite . a specific proposal for measuring the unruh effect in this setting , using an accelerated impurity as de witt detector ,",
    "was proposed in @xcite ( impurities can be used also as detectors of casimir forces and quantum friction @xcite ) .",
    "other very interesting approaches are to use a non - linear optical medium in which a refractive index perturbation moves at high speed @xcite , or to exploit the geometric properties of graphene sheets @xcite .",
    "the use of engineered lattices of superconducting qubits @xcite has been already used to probe the dynamical casimir effect @xcite and proposed for unruh physics .    in this work ,",
    "we take a different strategy and propose a new framework for simulating the unruh effect , which is based on the _ quantum simulation _ of dirac fermions using ultracold fermionic atoms in a 2d optical lattice @xcite . the possibility of simulating the dirac hamiltonian in certain spacetime metrics",
    "was recently put forward by some of us , where the information about the metric is encoded in the tunneling terms shaped by the lasers @xcite .",
    "building upon that framework , we propose to start the experiment by setting up an optical lattice whose dynamics simulates the massless dirac hamiltonian in 2 + 1d in minkowski spacetime , where the fermi velocity , analogue to the speed of sound in a bec , plays the role of the speed of light . by achieving the ground state",
    ", we can assume that our quantum state is the dirac vacuum in minkowski spacetime .",
    "now , we can _ quench _ the system by suddenly changing the tunneling terms in the lattice to the values corresponding to the dirac hamiltonian in a rindler metric .",
    "in other terms , the same dirac physics minkowski vacuum of dirac fermions but viewed by an accelerated observer .",
    "canonical observation of the unruh effect should be performed now by a local _ de witt detector _",
    "@xcite , a device whose purpose is to couple minimally to the quantum fluctuations of the field and interchange energy @xcite . the full spectrum of local fluctuations obtained is predicted to follow both unruh and takagi s predictions .",
    "what is the novelty of our approach ?",
    "our setup is a quantum simulator , i.e. , a",
    "_ quantum computer of special purpose _ @xcite that allows for a systematic study of gravitating quantum matter .",
    "for instance , within our quantum simulator it is possible to change the fermi velocity or the shape of the metric .",
    "more importantly , it provides a framework for systematically studying quantum many - body systems @xcite . beyond the free fields studied in this work ,",
    "let us emphasize that the setup we propose for simulating the unruh effect can be used also for studying interacting fermions in curved spacetime , and that it allows for the subtle manipulations needed to simulate experiments in relativistic quantum information @xcite .",
    "another parameter which can be easily tuned is the dimensionality of the artificial spacetime , thus allowing us to probe the aforementioned inversion theorem of takagi @xcite .",
    "the investigation of the unruh effect bears a strong relation to the study of boundary effects .",
    "indeed , the horizon can be considered as a boundary for fields which are accessible to the accelerated observer .",
    "ensuring that the boundary conditions do not spoil the unitarity of the theory imposes certain conditions on the hamiltonian @xcite which , as we will show , are fulfilled naturally for the dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime , and provides a procedure to perform the right discretization .",
    "surprisingly , our hamiltonian has the same form as one of the candidates to solve the riemann conjecture via the hilbert - polya approach , @xmath0 @xcite . in a different line ,",
    "our model bears relation to the hyperbolically deformed hamiltonians @xcite and to the techniques of off - diagonal confinement in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "as our work is meant to be directed to a wide audience , we try as much as possible to keep it self - contained . in section [ sec : rindler ]",
    "we provide a pedagogical overview of the relativistic physics for an accelerated observer , both classical and quantum .",
    "section [ sec : dirac ] introduces the dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime and discusses its discretization .",
    "readers mainly interested in the proposed quantum simulation of the unruh effect could go directly to section [ sec : proposal ] , where we detail our quench strategy , provide numerical simulations of the expected results and suggest a possible experimental implementation .",
    "we finish in section [ sec : conclusions ] with conclusions and proposals for further work .",
    "this section is a review of the physics of an accelerated observer .",
    "we will discuss in a pedagogical fashion the basics of the rindler metric , the thermalization theorem and the unruh effect .",
    "let us briefly review rindler physics , i.e. , minkowski spacetime viewed by an accelerated observer @xcite .",
    "let us consider an observer moving with constant acceleration @xmath1 ( for convenience in the following we take the speed of light to be @xmath2 ) in the positive @xmath3-axis , at rest at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "physics seen by this observer is more properly described in a co - moving reference frame , obtained by the _ fermi - walker _ transport procedure .",
    "let @xmath6 be the co - moving time coordinate for this observer , and @xmath7 the co - moving space coordinate .",
    "they are called _ rindler coordinates _ , and can be found using this transformation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rindler ] ) @xmath8 in particular , the considered trajectory corresponds to @xmath9 for all @xmath6 .",
    "notice the similarity with polar coordinates , where @xmath7 plays the role of a radius and @xmath6 is an angle in hyperbolic geometry .",
    "the principle of equivalence states that physics seen by a non - inertial observer can be absorbed by a change in her metric .",
    "indeed , in these coordinates , the minkowski metric becomes @xmath10 which is known as the rindler metric .",
    "notice that the rindler time direction corresponds to a symmetry of the metric , i.e. , it constitutes a killing vector which is inequivalent to the usual minkowski time direction .",
    "in fact , it corresponds to a boost transformation . in the polar coordinates view , it is the generator of hyperbolic rotations .",
    "furthermore , the pole @xmath11 corresponds to a singularity in the coordinate system , because the coefficient of @xmath12 vanishes .",
    "this is the hallmark of an _",
    "event horizon_. in fact , one can consider the rindler metric as a particular example of _ optical metric _ where the only non - trivial entry of the metric is @xmath13 , which becomes position - dependent .",
    "these are called optical metrics because propagation of light along the geodesics is equivalent to `` galilean '' propagation in a refractive medium with a position - dependent refractive index @xmath14 , which implies the `` local '' speed of light @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding optical metric is of the form @xmath16    for rindler spacetime , @xmath17 . as @xmath18 , the local speed of light vanishes , which implies that signals can not propagate beyond that point .",
    "thus , spacetime is separated into two parts which do not communicate : the two rindler wedges , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is remarkable that an event horizon can appear even in a flat spacetime .",
    "( rindler time ) and @xmath7 ( rindler space ) . the rindler wedge , delimited by dashed lines , is the domain of validity of the coordinate patch .",
    "constant @xmath6 lines ( green ) are spacelike , and constant @xmath7 lines ( red ) are timelike . for simplicity , we plot the trajectories only in the right wedge , @xmath21 , as the ones for the wedge @xmath22 can be obtained by reflection around the @xmath23-axis .",
    "note that as detailed in sect .",
    "[ sec : proposal ] both wedges are realized and are at the same footing in our proposal . , width=340 ]    let us return to the proposed accelerated observer , which in rindler spacetime just sits at rest at @xmath9 . from her point of view , light moves at her left more slowly than usually , and faster at her right . near the horizon , @xmath11 , light moves more and more slowly , coming to stop at @xmath11 , i.e. , its local speed of light is zero ( while the actual speed of light stays obviously constant to 1 ) .",
    "let us now consider objects which are static with respect to the accelerated observer , i.e. , objects at rest in rindler spacetime at different values of @xmath7 . tracing back their trajectories to minkowski spacetime , it can be checked that they correspond also to accelerated trajectories , with acceleration @xmath24 .",
    "this implies that , in order to keep pace with an observer with acceleration @xmath25 in front of you , you must accelerate faster than that @xcite .",
    "this result is known as _ bell s spaceship paradox_.      the interplay between thermodynamics and general relativity gives raise to surprising properties .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to spacetimes which contain a time - like killing vector , i.e. , spacetimes whose metric can be said to be time invariant , where we have a well defined concept of energy .",
    "in that case , _ tolman - eherenfest s theorem _",
    "@xcite states that for any field in thermal equilibrium within a stationary curved spacetime , the product of the local temperature and the modulus of the local time - like killing vector is constant , @xmath26 const .",
    "there is a simple way to visualize this result .",
    "photons emitted at one point @xmath27 in space with frequency @xmath28 will reach another point in @xmath29 with a redshifted frequency , @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the same factor should be applied to energies and to temperatures .",
    "thus , in rindler spacetime , temperature at any point is inversely proportional to the distance to the horizon . or , in other words",
    ", it is proportional to the acceleration of an observer stationary at that point .",
    "notice that this does not entail a non - zero temperature .",
    "the theorem still holds if the temperature is zero everywhere .",
    "but the biggest surprises show up when we introduce quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "let us consider a free fermionic field in minkowski spacetime , with hamiltonian @xmath31 , described in terms of local creation operators @xmath32 .",
    "the physical vacuum is the ground state of its hamiltonian , @xmath33 , and it does not correspond to the fock vacuum , @xmath34 , which is defined by @xmath35 for all @xmath3 . in the physical vacuum ,",
    "all the negative energy single - particle modes will be occupied    @xmath36    where @xmath37 creates the @xmath38-th mode , and @xmath39 is its energy . according to the usual convention",
    ", @xmath37 creates a particle if @xmath40 and an anti - particle if @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the physical vacuum is built by occupying all the anti - particle states , and none of the particle ones .",
    "let us now consider an accelerated observer moving through this vacuum .",
    "she will see physics displayed not on minkowski spacetime , but on a rindler metric .",
    "let @xmath42 be the appropriate hamiltonian operator , which is also a free fermionic hamiltonian .",
    "its single - particle modes are known as the rindler modes , @xmath43 .",
    "they have energies @xmath44 and are solutions to the wave equation in the rindler metric ( here the index @xmath45 labels the eigenstates , but does not correspond to momentum in the acceleration direction , since translational invariance is broken ) .",
    "the ground state of @xmath42 is    @xmath46    again , the rindler modes will qualify either as particles , if @xmath47 , or anti - particles if @xmath48 .",
    "the pure state @xmath33 does not need to be an eigenstate of @xmath42 , much less its ground state .",
    "from the point of view of the accelerated observer , who measures energies with @xmath42 , @xmath33 is not the true vacuum any more",
    ". how does this state look like to her ?",
    "it is crucial to realize that the rindler metric has a horizon , which separates space into two parts which can not communicate .",
    "thus , she will not detect @xmath33 , but the _ reduced density matrix _ which results of tracing out the hidden part @xmath49 where @xmath50 means a trace over the left - out degrees of freedom . a reduced density matrix can always be formally written as a thermal state @xmath51 where @xmath52 is called the entanglement hamiltonian @xcite . since the minkowski vacuum is a slater determinant , we can use wick s theorem in reverse to prove that the entanglement hamiltonian must be a free fermionic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in other terms , the accelerated observer will see a thermal state of free particles .",
    "the minkowski vacuum is invariant under lorentz boosts , which correspond to time translations in rindler spacetime .",
    "for @xmath53 , this property implies    @xmath54 . \\label{commutator}\\ ] ]    thus , @xmath55=0 $ ] , i.e. , the entanglement hamiltonian and the rindler hamiltonian must commute .",
    "in fact , they can be non - trivially proved to be proportional , and the constant of proportionality can be read as an inverse temperature @xmath56 where @xmath57 here @xmath58 is known as the _ unruh temperature _ and this result , which is far more general than the particular case studied here , is the _ thermalization theorem _ @xcite .",
    "thus , the unruh temperature does not appear because of any underlying stochasticity .",
    "the loss of information which gives rise to the thermal effect is related to the presence of the horizon .",
    "an important consequence of thermalization theorem is that minkowski vacuum _ appears to be stationary to an accelerated observer_. indeed , while minkowski vacuum is clearly not an eigenstate of dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime and , thus , evolves non - trivially in rindler time , _ what an accelerated observer detects is invariant under such time evolution _ as the thermal state is a diagonal density matrix in the rindler eigenbases .",
    "this observation is crucial in our proposal for simulating the unruh effect with ultracold atoms , see sect .",
    "[ sec : proposal ] .",
    "let us consider the canonical transformation between minkowski ( @xmath37 ) and rindler modes ( @xmath43 )    @xmath59    this is a bogoliubov transformation in disguise , because a positive energy rindler mode ( particle ) requires both positive and negative minkowski modes for its expansion ( particle and anti - particle ) .",
    "in fact , as the acceleration is position dependent , the relevant bogoliubov transformation has to be defined locally . in the continuous limit ,",
    "the global bogoliubov transformation is even ill - defined as the eigenstates are not normalizable . in order to properly define it we have to consider normalized states @xcite , for instance wave packets centered around a generic point @xmath60 . on physical terms",
    ", this means that we can associate a well - defined acceleration to the rindler wave - packet . for practical purposes ,",
    "the wave - packet normalization is equivalent to restricting the scalar product of the unnormalized modes to a small region @xmath61 such that @xmath62 of space around @xmath60 . with this definition ,",
    "the occupation of each rindler mode on the minkowski ground state is given by @xmath63 and the thermalization theorem ensures that    @xmath64    with @xmath65 according to eq . , where @xmath3 is the spatial distance of the point @xmath66 from the horizon .",
    "but the _ unruh effect",
    "_ goes beyond the thermalization theorem , because it is defined _ operationally _ , in terms of what a local observer can measure . the so - called _ de witt _",
    "detector @xcite is a device carried along with the observer , which couples minimally to the fermionic field at a spatial point @xmath60 , and can emit and absorb particles . under a large variety of circumstances",
    "it can be proved that the probability amplitude of absorption / emission is given solely by the _",
    "wightman function _",
    "@xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the trajectory for the observer  for simplicity we consider trajectories parallel to the @xmath3-axis and we omit remaining constant spatial coordinates  and @xmath69 is the creation operator for a fermion at event @xmath70 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , is the _ detector response function _ , which should be experimentally accessible , as we will discuss later .",
    "the formula makes equal sense in minkowski or in rindler spacetimes , if we are allowed to abuse notation and let @xmath3 and @xmath73 denote the coordinates in both . in rindler spacetime",
    ", the trajectory of an accelerated observer will be just a constant @xmath74 .",
    "let us define two different basis changes , from rindler space - localized states to rindler and minkowski modes , respectively . at time @xmath4 , if @xmath32 creates a particle at point @xmath3 , we have @xmath75 where the unitary matrices @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the single - particle wave functions of minkowski and rindler modes , respectively , and determine the unitary transformation @xmath78 in , @xmath79 . here and in the following by the bar we denote the complex conjugate of the matrix elements .",
    "so we get @xmath80 thus , the detector response function is strongly dependent on the form of the rindler and minkowski modes , through @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "going beyond the thermalization theorem , unruh predicted that the distribution function @xmath72 will be _ thermal_. but",
    "a surprise is hiding behind eq . due to the spatial dependence of the rindler and minkowski modes .",
    "if the dimension of space is _ odd _ , then the response function of a fermionic field will follow the fermi - dirac distribution function , as one would expect .",
    "but if the dimension of space is _ even _ , @xmath83 will follow a bose - einstein distribution .",
    "the opposite is true for a free bosonic field .",
    "this fact , known as takagi s inversion theorem @xcite stems from dimensional effects in wave propagation , analogous to those observed for light propagating radially . in odd dimension ,",
    "the huygens principle holds , and a pointlike perturbation after a time @xmath73 is concentrated in a spherical shell of radius @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the propagation velocity . in even dimension , however , not all the scattered waves propagate at the same @xmath85 , the huygens principle does not hold and the perturbation becomes radially spread with time .",
    "alternative physical meanings of the detector response function are worth mentioning .",
    "the first is a measure of quantum fluctuations : @xmath83 is the power spectrum of the quantum noise @xcite .",
    "the second is related to the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "let us consider a physical plane in space , whose interaction with our fermionic field can be expressed as a dirichlet boundary condition .",
    "now let us move this plane with constant acceleration @xmath25 .",
    "then , the stress - energy tensor at any point will depend on its current distance to the plane .",
    "in fact , it can be proved @xcite that the limit @xmath86 can be made meaningful , thus providing a well defined stress - energy tensor for the rindler vacuum , which induces quantum fluctuations that are probed by expression .",
    "in this section we describe the behavior of dirac fermions in rindler spacetime for one and two spatial dimensions .",
    "in particular , we explicitly construct the corresponding hamiltonian in a square lattice .",
    "indeed , since the rindler metric has a time - like killing vector field , we can use a hamiltonian formalism and discretize it to get a simple tunneling model .",
    "the resulting model bears a surprising resemblance to the @xmath87 hamiltonian used in the hilbert - polya approach to proving the riemann conjecture .",
    "this point is further detailed in appendix [ sec:1drindler ] .",
    "let us consider a relativistic massless fermionic field in two dimensions , governed by the dirac equation in minkowski spacetime    @xmath88    where the @xmath89 are a representation of the clifford algebra , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the minkowski metric and @xmath92 .",
    "in , as well as in the rest of the section , sums over repeated indices are left implicit according to einstein s convention . as it stands , the equation is manifestly lorentz covariant .",
    "let us shift to a hamiltonian view , which is more convenient for simulation .",
    "in other words , we single out the time - derivative    @xmath93    let us make the following choice for the @xmath94 matrices in two dimensions , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 .",
    "we obtain    @xmath98    equation can be formulated on a general ( curved ) background metric @xmath99 as well . for spinor systems",
    "it is very convenient to introduce the _ vielbein _ , which is a set of vectors defined on the tangent manifold , @xmath100 , such that @xmath101 .",
    "the parallel transport for the vielbein vectors defines the _ spin - connection _",
    ", @xmath102 , and allows a compact expression for the covariant derivative of a spinorial field @xcite",
    "@xmath103    where @xmath104 $ ] . by making use of it ,",
    "the dirac equation reads    @xmath105    where the _ curved _ gamma matrices @xmath106 are defined by @xmath107 , and the curved indices @xmath108 are lowered and raised by contracting with the metric @xmath99 and its inverse @xmath109 . when we single out the time - derivative , we obtain again a schrdinger equation of the form    @xmath110    where @xmath111 .",
    "let us now consider the specific case of the 2d rindler metric @xmath112 .",
    "the only non - vanishing element of the spin - connection is @xmath113 . with the aforementioned choice for the @xmath94 matrices",
    ", we get    @xmath114    thus , the hamiltonian density becomes    @xmath115    which is the single - particle rindler hamiltonian .",
    "its second - quantized form is simply    @xmath116    the same expression can obviously be derived by taking the legendre transformation of the dirac lagrangian in rindler spacetime .    in intuitive terms , the @xmath117 term is related to the volume form , @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath119 term comes for the covariant derivative and it is essential to ensure the hermiticity of @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , this factor cancels the so - called _ deficiency indices _ @xcite , i.e. , allows us to treat the horizon at @xmath120 as a boundary , ensuring that any boundary condition can be imposed while respecting self - adjointness of the hamiltonian .",
    "this property is more evident once is cast in symmetric fashion , i.e. , the spatial derivatives act symmetrically both on @xmath121 and @xmath122 ,    @xmath123    in this form , the propagation in rindler metric is sensitive only to the overall scale factor which determines a fermi velocity that changes linearly along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "it is worth noticing that the equivalent symmetric formulation of single - particle hamiltonian is    @xmath124    which is also manifestly hermitian .",
    "it will be further discussed in the appendix [ sec:1drindler ] , in relation with the riemann conjecture .",
    "the minkowski and rindler dirac hamiltonians in one and two spatial dimensions can be suitably discretized on the lattice @xcite . as shown in detail in the appendix [ subsec : discr ] ,",
    "a convenient way of doing this is to consider a 1d - chain or a 2d - square lattice with non - interacting spinless fermions    @xmath125    where the sum runs over all pairs of nearest neighbors sites @xmath126 . since the 1d - dirac models can be realized as a slice along @xmath3 ( defined as the direction perpendicular to the rindler horizon ) of the 2d - dirac ones , we focus on the latter case .",
    "hamiltonian can represent the dynamics of each of the chiral components of the minkowski dirac hamiltonian if the tunneling terms @xmath127 have all the same modulus and the sum of their phases around each plaquette is @xmath128 .",
    "this corresponds to the well known @xmath128-flux hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "all possible choices of phases respecting the @xmath128-flux condition are equivalent , as they are related by gauge transformations .",
    "we will focus on the one corresponding to the symmetry gauge for the synthetic gauge field associated to the phases .",
    "precisely , @xmath129 where we adopt cartesian coordinates to parametrize the lattice , @xmath130 and denote with @xmath131 the lattice spacing .    the discretized version of the rindler dirac hamiltonian can also be chosen to be of the form , but with spatially modulated tunnelings , @xmath127 .",
    "each tunneling rate has to be proportional to the average @xmath3 coordinate of each link , which represents the distance from the horizon .",
    "we place the horizon at @xmath120 accordingly to the coordinates chosen in .",
    "the tunneling phases have to satisfy the same @xmath128-flux condition as for the dirac hamiltonian in minkowski space . for the symmetric gauge choice of we have    @xmath132    the numerical simulation and the experimental implementation in optical lattices of the hamiltonians and will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we would like to remark here that in principle any other lattice realization of the dirac hamiltonian like the ones in bichromatic @xcite , hexagonal @xcite and brick - wall lattices @xcite , which do not involve artificial gauge fields , can be considered and deformed by shaping the tunneling term to reproduce the dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime .",
    "other artificial lattice dirac systems such as nano - patterned 2d electron gases , photonic crystals , micro - wave lattices @xcite or polaritons @xcite could also be used .",
    "since the unruh effect is a single - particle and purely kinematic effect , it could be studied using both bosonic and fermionic systems . the latter offers a simple route to explore the relativistic ( linear dispersion relation ) regime , as detailed in the next section .",
    "in this section we present our proposal to study the unruh effect for dirac fermions in an optical lattice , in one and two spatial dimensions .",
    "the crucial idea behind our proposal is that all measurements made by an accelerated observer on the minkowski vacuum of the dirac field can be simulated by _ quenching _ the dirac hamiltonian from the one in minkowski spacetime to the one in rindler spacetime , which amounts to quench the tunneling amplitudes from constant to properly position - dependent values . as a by far non - trivial consequence of thermalization theorem ( _ cf . _",
    "[ sect : thermalization ] ) , the minkowski vacuum will now be seen as a thermal state in rindler , which we will subsequently probe with a suitable analogue of de witt detectors , yielding the local fluctuation spectrum predicted by the unruh effect . as a thermal state corresponds only to populations of rindler modes ,",
    "the minkowski vacuum is stationary , that is to say that is invariant under time translations in rindler spacetime ( this property is not so surprising because rindler time translations correspond to lorentz boosts in the original minkowski coordinates ) .",
    "we start by providing an overview of the experimental procedure .",
    "our scheme relies crucially on one - particle excitation spectroscopy , which we discuss in detail .",
    "the robustness of our scheme is then validated by performing a numerical simulation of the response function in realistic experimental conditions .",
    "we conclude by proposing an experimental implementation of the protocol which is accessible using state - of - the - art techniques .      as explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : unruh_effect ] , the observation of the unruh effect requires a measurement of the wightman two - point correlation function in the frequency domain for an accelerated observer in the minkowski vacuum . in other terms , we have to measure the fourier transform of two - point correlations in time . for a dirac system as the one we consider ,",
    "the minkowski vacuum is the fermi sea and what needs to be measured is the overlap between the state corresponding to a one - hole excitation at different times .",
    "furthermore , this one - hole excitation must follow an accelerated trajectory .",
    "traditionally , an accelerated observer is considered in order to observe the unruh effect , with the minkowski vacuum at rest and the one - hole excitation moving .",
    "for instance , this is the approach considered in @xcite , where the one - hole excitation is created by the coupling to an impurity .",
    "however , due to the equivalence principle , the measurement can actually be done in any reference frame .",
    "we choose to perform it in the rest frame of the observer and the one - hole excitation .",
    "there , the time evolution is governed by the dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime ( eq .",
    "( [ rindler.ham ] ) ) , and the response function is simply the overlap between the one - hole excitation at rest at different times .",
    "the measurement of the wightman spectral function can then be interpreted as the creation of a one - hole excitation at a fixed location @xmath133 in the fermi sea , the evolution of this state with the dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime for a time @xmath73 , and the creation of a particle at @xmath133 .",
    "this is exactly what one - particle excitation spectroscopy , a standard technique in cold atom experiments , determines @xcite .",
    "thus , our protocol to observe the unruh effect consists of three steps :    1 .",
    "_ preparation of the minkowski vacuum _ by achieving the ground state of the dirac hamiltonian with a uniform fermi velocity ( dirac hamiltonian in minkowski spacetime ) ; 2 .",
    "_ quench to an accelerated frame _ governed by the dirac hamiltonian with a spatially dependent fermi velocity ( dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime ) .",
    "the quench introduces an event horizon in the middle of the gas , effectively disconnecting it in two halves ; 3 .   _ measurement of the wightman function _ in the accelerated ( rindler ) frame using local one - particle excitation spectroscopy at point @xmath133 .",
    "the first two steps provide a convenient method for preparing the minkowski vacuum as the ground state of a hamiltonian which can be easily implemented experimentally , and for making it evolve into an accelerated ( rindler ) frame .",
    "the third step , local one - particle excitation spectroscopy , is the crucial ingredient of our proposal .",
    "it creates a one - hole excitation in the gas , whose dynamics in the accelerated ( rindler ) frame produces the bogoliubov transformation .",
    "and it is this transformation which is responsible for the thermalization theorem and the unruh effect .",
    "given its importance , we describe it in detail in the next section .",
    "our proposal for observing the unruh effect relies on the use of one - particle excitation spectroscopy for measuring the wightman function .",
    "this technique consists in transferring a fraction of atoms of the gas to an auxiliary energy band which is initially unoccupied and has a considerably smaller bandwidth , so that it can be neglected .",
    "the process requires a field coupling both bands , and can be implemented in a variety of fashions ( radio - frequency , one - photon or two - photon laser transitions ) depending on the atomic species chosen . in our case , we require the process to be local , since the wightman function is defined locally ( at point @xmath133 ) and the unruh temperature varies as a function of the distance to the horizon .",
    "if we consider the ensemble of the two bands as an effective two - level system , the effect of the coupling can be modeled in the interaction picture as    @xmath134    where @xmath135 represents the detuning between the frequency of the field and the energy of the auxiliary band where the operator @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) creates ( destroys ) an atom , and we assume an integration over all momenta .",
    "since the measurement is performed after the quench , the operator @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) evolves with the rindler hamiltonian .",
    "now , let us compute the occupation of the auxiliary band at a later time .",
    "as it is highly excited , we can assume it to be initially empty .",
    "the initial state is thus    @xmath140    taking a sufficiently small coupling @xmath141 allows us to treat at first order in perturbation theory .",
    "we find    @xmath142    then , the occupation @xmath143 of the auxiliary state for @xmath144 is    @xmath145    [ eq : nb ] where we have used translation invariance in time .",
    "the calculation above not only demonstrates that local one - particle excitation spectroscopy measures the wightman spectral function .",
    "it also clearly shows that it is the time evolution under the rindler hamiltonian which is responsible for the observed thermal response .",
    "we have calculated the occupation @xmath143 assuming that the pulse started at @xmath4 , i.e. , immediately after the quench we have used the original minkowski vacuum to start with. however , the integral depends only on the duration of the pulse , and not on the actual moment at which the pulse starts .",
    "this is an experimental manifestation of the stationary of minkowski vacuum in rindler spacetime and of the time invariance of the associated populations as rindler particles .",
    "let us now discuss in detail the range of validity of our approach and review some possible limitations .",
    "in our scheme we do not implement the dirac hamiltonian ( both in minkowski and rindler spacetimes ) in the continuum , but only a lattice version of it .",
    "this introduces a characteristic length scale in the system , the lattice spacing , and an associated uv energy cut - off .",
    "measurements of the wightman function below this length scale are not meaningful . however , the finite spatial resolution that one - particle excitation spectroscopy will have in the experiment naturally smears out these discretization artifacts .",
    "we will show below that a measurement of the response function convolved over two lattice sites is sufficient to suppress most of them .",
    "another consequence of implementing the dirac hamiltonian in an optical lattice is that the relativistic dispersion relation only holds in a certain range of energies , in the vicinity of the dirac points .",
    "thus , the measurements must be restricted to this energy range , which is given by the local tunneling rate .",
    "this limitation is common to other proposals for simulating relativistic effects with cold atoms .",
    "for instance , using the bogoliubov excitations of a bose - einstein condensate as relativistic particles is only valid in the phonon - like regime of the bogoliubov dispersion relation , and breaks down away from it .",
    "our protocol relies on a change of reference frame , from a rest frame to an accelerated one .",
    "this step is done by quenching the hamiltonian from minkowski to rindler spacetime .",
    "the change of reference frame should be instantaneous , an approximation which is valid if the quench time is much shorter than the smallest characteristic timescale of the system given by the inverse of the largest tunneling rate .",
    "we will see in sect .",
    "[ sect : implementation ] that experimentally this is a reasonable assumption .",
    "the main effect of the quench is to introduce an artificial horizon in the middle of the lattice that effectively disconnects the left and right halves . placing the horizon",
    "exactly in the middle of the system is important to minimize the distortions induced by the finite system size . finally , let us remark that quenching the hamiltonian of a quantum system normally triggers a temporal evolution of its initial state . in our case ,",
    "however , as we have observed at the end of sect .",
    "[ sect : thermalization ] and further argued in this section , the minkowski vacuum looks stationary to the accelerated observer and this dynamics is absent .",
    "indeed , the rindler hamiltonian is proportional to the entanglement hamiltonian of both halves of the system .",
    "thus , the density matrices of both halves are time - invariant as they are diagonal and depend only on the populations .",
    "the unruh effect implies that measurements of the wightman function at different distances from the horizon , and thus different accelerations , will yield different values of the unruh temperature . in order to compare these measurements ,",
    "the rates should be measured with respect to the proper time @xmath146 .",
    "for the rindler metric , eq . , @xmath147 with latexmath:[$\\xi \\propto    same time , the fourier transformation of the wightman function @xmath71 has to be performed with respect to the proper time . in the frequency domain",
    "it is then given by @xmath149 .",
    "finally , up to now we have been assuming that the minkowski vacuum can be exactly realized in the experiment . or , in other terms , that it is possible to prepare perfectly the ground state of the dirac hamiltonian in the homogeneous tunneling lattice at half filling ( exactly up to the dirac points ) . in real experiments",
    ", however , the actual temperature of the fermionic gas will not be zero but rather on the order of the tunneling rate .",
    "we will show that the signatures of the unruh effect can still be appreciated when starting with a finite - temperature sample .      in order to validate our scheme and address the effects presented above",
    "we have performed numerical simulations , which we present in this section .",
    "the calculations have been done using the @xmath128-flux realizations of the dirac hamiltonian ( eqs .",
    "( [ pi.flux.hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ rindler.pi.flux.hamiltonian ] ) ) in one and two spatial dimensions . in both cases",
    "we have simulated numerically the complete scheme , starting with an initial state in minkowski spacetime , assuming an instantaneous quench , and computing then the wightman response function as will measured by one - particle excitation spectroscopy ( see eq . ) .    in the calculations we fix the system sizes @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "the natural energy scale of the system is the bandwidth of the dirac hamiltonian in minkowski spacetime ( proportional to the tunneling strength @xmath152 in ) .",
    "therefore , all energies ( i.e. frequencies and temperatures ) are measured in units of @xmath152 . the amplitude @xmath153 that characterizes the tunneling strength of the dirac hamiltonian in rindler spacetime is in principle arbitrary due to the overall scale invariance of the rindler space",
    "we choose it so that the maximal tunneling rate is equal to the minkowski value , @xmath154 .",
    "the lattice spacing is fixed as @xmath155 and we attach @xmath156 coordinates to each site in a symmetric way with respect to the horizon , i.e. the @xmath120 line .",
    "thus , while @xmath157 always runs over integers , @xmath158 , @xmath159 runs over integers for @xmath160 odd , @xmath161 , and over half - integers for @xmath162 even , @xmath163 . note that fixing the horizon exactly in the middle of the gas is important to minimize the distortions introduced by the finite size of the system .    as we mentioned in the previous section , in a discrete realization of the dirac hamiltonian only measurements performed at length scales above the lattice spacing",
    "@xmath131 are meaningful .",
    "the finite spatial resolution of the measurements will automatically perform the required coarse - graining .",
    "we simulate it numerically by considering a convolution of the wightman function with a gaussian of standard deviation corresponding to @xmath164 lattice sites along the @xmath3 direction . the raw data obtained before the convolution , and further details concerning it are included in appendix [ sect : a3 ] .",
