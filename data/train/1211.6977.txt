    "determining accurate distances to brown dwarfs is important for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , distance is a vital quantity in establishing not only the space density of these objects , but also the luminosity function which can then be used to test models of star formation at the lowest masses .",
    "secondly , distances allow the spectra of brown dwarfs to be placed on an absolute flux scale to provide more quantitative checks of atmospheric models .",
    "thirdly , distances for the nearest objects allow us to construct a more complete view of our own solar neighborhood , allowing us to directly visualize the relative importance of brown dwarfs in the galactic context .",
    "sometimes , distance determinations produce results wholly unanticipated .",
    "for example , the @xmath6-band overluminosity of the t4.5 dwarf 2mass j05591914@xmath71404488 ( figure 2 of dahn et al .",
    "2002 ) was unexpected despite its location near the @xmath6-band bump at the l / t transition ( e.g. , looper et al .",
    "2008 ) , a feature thought to be associated with decreasing cloudiness @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that the overluminosity is due to the presence of an unresolved binary @xcite .",
    "similarly unexpected was the recent determination that young , field l dwarfs are often significantly underluminous for their spectral types at near - infrared magnitudes @xcite .",
    "some of the earliest parallax determinations for brown dwarfs were by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , once surveys such as the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis ; epchtein et al .",
    "1997 ) began to identify l and t dwarfs in large numbers .",
    "more recently , parallax programs by groups such as @xcite and @xcite have pushed astrometry measurements to the latest t spectral subclasses . with the discovery of y dwarfs from wise ( cushing et al .",
    "2011 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2012 ) we are now pushing these measurements to even colder temperatures @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present distance and/or proper motion measurements for an additional eight y dwarfs , along with three nearby late - t dwarfs , and present the first tangential velocity measurements for y dwarfs .",
    "our set of objects includes all known y dwarfs for which we have imaging data at a sufficient number of epochs for parallax and proper motion estimation .",
    "the exception is wise 1828 + 2650 , presented separately by @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have included three late t dwarfs from an investigation of the low - mass end of the substellar mass function within 8 pc of the sun @xcite .",
    "the complete sample is listed in the observing log shown in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "each of these objects has been observed at two or three epochs by the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) and at least four more epochs of imaging observations by the irac instrument @xcite on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "( _ spitzer _ ; @xcite ) , the wfc3 instrument @xcite of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , and various ground - based observatories .",
    "the observatories and instruments used are listed in the footnote of table  [ tbl-1 ] , and further details are given by @xcite .",
    "astrometric information was extracted from the observed images at the various epochs using the standard maximum likelihood technique in which a point spread function ( psf ) is fit to each observed source profile .",
    "the technique was essentially the same as used in 2mass , the details of which are given by @xcite , except that the source extraction results presented here were made using coadded images rather than focal - plane images .",
    "the positional uncertainties were estimated using an error model which includes the effects of instrumental and sky background noise and psf uncertainty .",
    "the psf and its associated uncertainty map were estimated for each image individually using a set of bright stars in the field , the median number for which was 14 .",
    "since the coadded images were nyquist sampled or better , sinc interpolation was appropriate during psf estimation and subsequent profile fitting to the data .    in order to minimize the systematic effects of focal - plane distortion and plate scale and rotation errors ,",
    "our astrometry is based on relative positions using a reference star ( or set of reference stars ) in the vicinity of the object . for most objects we were able to find a reference star within @xmath8 common to all images except for those of wise , due to the lower sensitivity of the latter . in order to incorporate the wise data it has therefore been necessary to include bright reference stars which in general were much more widely separated from the brown dwarf ( up to @xmath9 ) .",
    "most of these were taken from the 2mass point source catalog @xcite . in order not to let these stars significantly compromise the astrometry measurements from the more sensitive images with close reference stars",
    ", we used a hybrid scheme in which the bright stars were treated as secondary references , bootstrapped to the close reference stars using the images in which they were in common .",
    "the procedure is based on the following measurement model for the observed separation between the brown dwarf and reference star :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the extracted positions of the brown dwarf and @xmath13th reference star , respectively , estimated from the image at epoch @xmath14 based on the nominal position calibration of that image ; @xmath15 represent the catalog position of the reference star , and @xmath16 represent errors in the catalog position ; @xmath17 represent the estimation errors for the brown dwarf , and @xmath18 represent the estimation errors for the reference star .",
    "these estimation errors include the effects of random measurement noise on the source extraction as well as the residual effects of focal - plane distortion in the position differences .",
    "we assume that they can all be described by zero - mean gaussian random processes .",
    "if we further assume that the @xmath19 are described _ a priori _ by zero - mean gaussian random processes with standard deviations substantially larger than the extraction uncertainties of the reference stars , then an optimal estimate of the brown dwarf position can be obtained from :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the set of detected reference stars in the image at epoch @xmath14 , and @xmath22 is the number of stars in the set .    the resulting estimates are included in table [ tbl-1 ] in the form of offsets from the nominal position of the brown dwarf at each epoch , and the set of reference stars used is given in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "after having obtained @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the individual reference star catalog errors can then be estimated using :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the set of all epochs for which the @xmath13th reference star is detected in the corresponding image , and @xmath27 is the number of epochs in the set .",
    "these values can be applied as corrections to the catalog positions of the reference stars , enabling a corresponding time series of estimated brown dwarf positions to be obtained separately for each individual reference star via ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the scatter in these estimates then provides a check on the assumptions regarding systematic effects such as focal - plane distortion and possible small proper motions of the reference stars themselves .",
    "we have included the effect of this scatter in the final quoted error bars in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the measurement model incorporated the effects of parallax and linear proper motion , with approprate correction for the earth - trailing orbit in the case of _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "the equations used @xcite were as follows :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the observation time [ yr ] of the @xmath13th astrometric measurement , and @xmath30 is the vector position of the observer relative to the sun in celestial coordinates and astronomical units . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are unit vectors pointing north and west from the position of the source .",
    "@xmath30 is the position of the earth for 2mass , sdss , wise , and hst observations ; for _ spitzer _ observations , @xmath30 is the position of the spacecraft .",
    "the observed positional difference on the left hand side is in arcsec , the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are in arcsec , the proper motion @xmath35 and @xmath36 are in arcsec / yr , and the parallax @xmath37 is in arcsec .    maximum likelihood estimates , based on the assumption of gaussian measurement noise , were made of five parameters : the ra and dec position offsets of the source at a specified reference time , the ra and dec rates of proper motion , and the parallax .",
    "the uncertainties were derived using the standard procedure for maximum likelihood estimation @xcite using the positional uncertainties quoted in table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "the resulting estimates of proper motion and parallax and their associated uncertainties are given in table [ tbl-3 ] , and the model fits with respect to the astrometry measurements are presented in figures [ fig1a ] , [ fig1b ] , and [ fig1c ] .",
    "the chi squared values , @xmath38 , for the parameter fits in table [ tbl-3 ] are , for the most part , close to the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath39 , indicating reasonably good modeling of position uncertainties .",
    "formally , the probability of exceeding @xmath38 given @xmath39 has a median value 0.29 .",
    "the parallaxes that we present are , strictly speaking , relative parallaxes since no correction has been made for the small parallaxes and proper motions of the reference stars , most of which are relatively nearby .",
    "however , the expected correction for such effects is only @xmath40 mas @xcite which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than our typical astrometric uncertainties listed in table [ tbl-3 ] , so in this error regime the distinction between relative and absolute parallaxes is unimportant .    in order to check to what extent our parallax and proper motion estimates",
    "may have been affected by systematic effects of focal - plane distortion not properly modeled by the statistical assumptions of the previous section , we have compared the rms residuals of the above fits ( obtained using multiple reference stars ) with those obtained using a single reference star for each brown dwarf , and found that there was no significant difference .",
    "this suggests that whatever residual focal plane distortion errors exist , they are smaller than the random errors of source extraction .",
    "we have converted our maximum likelihood estimates of parallax into most probable estimates of distance taking into account both the parallax measurements themselves and prior information .",
    "the latter includes an assumption that our objects are spatially distributed in a statistically uniform manner .",
    "formally , that would imply that parallax values are distributed _ a priori _ as @xmath41 ; the singularity at zero would then lead to difficulties in estimating the _ a posteriori _ most probable @xmath42 . even though the zero parallax can be excluded on physical grounds ,",
    "there is still a bias towards small values such that for @xmath43 , maximum likelihood parallax estimates become insignificant @xcite .",
    "fortunately there is additional prior information to alleviate this problem ; small parallaxes ( i.e. large distances ) can be excluded if they are inconsistent with the observed proper motion based on an assumed velocity dispersion of the objects being studied @xcite .    with these considerations in mind ,",
    "our estimates of distance , @xmath44 , are based on the following assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "our maximum likelihood parallax values , @xmath45 , are distributed as gaussians with standard deviation @xmath46 .",
    "our objects are distributed spatially in a statistically uniform way , so that the _ a priori _ probability density distribution of @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "the distribution of tangential velocities of y dwarfs in the solar neighborhood can be described by a gaussian random process with mean and standard deviation @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively ; we assume the values @xmath50 km s@xmath4 and @xmath51 km s@xmath4 respectively , representative of previous observations of t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we then obtain the most probable distance , @xmath52 , by maximizing the conditional probability density @xmath53 , which from bayes rule can be expressed by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the magnitude of our maximum likelihood estimate of proper motion .",
    "our distance estimates are presented in column 9 of table [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "the error bars correspond to the 0.159 and 0.841 points of the cumulative distribution with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "as is evident from table [ tbl-1 ] , our observations represent a mixed bag in terms of telescopes ( and hence spatial resolution ) and time sampling since they were not specifically designed for astrometry , but rather for followup photometry of brown dwarfs detected by wise .",
    "the quality of the observations was quite varied , and not always with sufficient pixel subsampling for the estimation of the high quality psfs necessary for astrometry . in the case of _ spitzer _",
    ", for example , each observation consisted of a set of only five dithered images .",
    "in addition , the time sampling of the parallactic cadence is of key importance in the estimation of parallax .",
    "the ideal sampling involves observations at solar elongation angles of @xmath56 , and this is achieved by wise , albeit with large position errors ( typically @xmath57 ) .",
    "these elongation angles are critical for an object on the ecliptic and less important at high ecliptic latitudes . for the parallax measurements described here , the worst example of poor sampling was wise 1541 - 2250 for which all of the non - wise observations were in one quadrant of solar elongation angle ( see column 8 of table [ tbl-1 ] ) ,",
    "so it is not surprising that the observations did not yield a significant parallax measurement .",
    "the previous measurement , corresponding to an estimated distance range of 2.24.1 pc @xcite , was based on even fewer observations and furthermore used position estimates for which the psf errors were somewhat underestimated .",
    "our present result of @xmath58 pc therefore supercedes that estimate , but this object should clearly be revisited once a more optimal sampling of the parallactic ellipse has been obtained . by and large , however , there is a good correlation between the sampling cadence and the quality of the parallax estimate ; future observations will be optimized both for image quality and cadence .",
    "nevertheless , significant parallaxes ( @xmath59 ) have been obtained for five of the eight y dwarfs and all three of the t dwarfs , thus providing distance estimates .",
    "also , we have combined the latter with our proper motion estimates to yield tangential velocities , @xmath1 .",
    "of course , our estimated values , @xmath52 and @xmath60 , are somewhat dependent on the assumed prior distribution of @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) , and the assumed similarity to the t dwarf distribution may not be valid if the y dwarfs represent a significantly older population . in order to assess the sensitivity to this assumption",
    ", the distance estimates were repeated using a @xmath49 of 100 km s@xmath4 .",
    "it was found that for a parallax significance @xmath61 , the increase in @xmath49 led to no more than a 20% change ( always in the positive direction ) in @xmath52 and hence @xmath60 . for lower values of @xmath62 , @xmath60 becomes biased towards the _ a priori _ value , @xmath48 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "thus in table [ tbl-3 ] we quote @xmath60 values only for @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath63 the reliability of our distance estimates is dependent on the validity of the assumptions regarding the _ a priori _ distribution of @xmath1 .    on this basis",
    "we obtained significant values of @xmath1 for two of our y dwarfs ; both are @xmath3 km s@xmath4 , suggesting membership in the thin disk population @xcite .",
    "similar analysis techniques , both in terms of the source extraction and parallax estimation , were used by @xcite to estimate the distance to the t8.5 object wise 1118 + 3125 , inferred ( with the aid of its observed common proper motion ) to be a member of the @xmath64 uma system , with excellent agreement with the known distance of that system .",
    "the distance estimates for the present sample , all of which are @xmath2 pc , have enabled the estimation of absolute magnitudes .",
    "these indicate that luminosities plummet at the t / y boundary @xcite as illustrated by figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] which represent updated versions of the absolute magnitude versus spectral type plots from the latter work .",
    "the steep decrease may at least partially account for the apparent scatter in absolute magnitudes of objects of the same spectral type , since in the y0 regime an error of half a spectral type apparently corresponds to more than a magnitude difference in luminosity .",
    "more data will be required to make a definitive statement , however .",
    "the absolute magnitudes also provide valuable guidance for models in the ultra - cool regime . to this end",
    "we have compared our observational results with model - based and empirical predictions using plots of absolute magnitude as a function of color , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the @xmath65 verus @xmath5 plot in the upper panel shows that the y dwarfs continue the trend set by the l and t dwarfs based on the parallax observations of @xcite .",
    "a key feature is the turnover in the blueward progression of the color at @xmath66 , at considerably redder @xmath5 than predicted by cloud - free models as illustrated by the solid curve .",
    "such behavior is also apparent in the color - magnitude diagrams for cloud - free models presented by @xcite .",
    "the dotted / dashed curves in figure [ fig4 ] represent models incorporating the effect of clouds containing various amounts of cr , mns , na@xmath67s , zns , and kcl condensates @xcite , as indicated by the sedimentation efficiency parameter , @xmath68 ; lower values correspond to optically thicker clouds .",
    "it is apparent that these models can account at least partly for the relative redness of some of the @xmath5 colors but they predict a blueward hook for temperatures below 400 k which does not appear to be matched by the observations . perhaps some of the scatter in @xmath5 colors in figure [ fig4 ] might be explained in terms of a patchy cloud model ; it is also possible that the inclusion of water clouds might improve consistency with the observations .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] does show reasonable consistency between observations and models based on irac colors , i.e. , @xmath69}$ ] and @xmath70}$ ] as a function of the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color .",
    "the only major discrepancy is that wise 1828 + 2650 , whose effective temperature is believed to be @xmath71 k , falls at a location more indicative of 500 k on these plots .",

    "<S> we present astrometric measurements of eleven nearby ultracool brown dwarfs of spectral types y and late - t , based on imaging observations from a variety of space - based and ground - based telescopes . </S>",

    "<S> we have employed a novel bayesian procedure for distance estimation which makes use of an _ a priori _ distribution of tangential velocities , @xmath1 , assumed similar to that implied by previous observations of t dwarfs . </S>",
