    "while the supergravity and string theory are well - motivated candidates of the fundamental theory , there often appear light scalar fields , called moduli , having planck - scale suppressed interactions with matter .",
    "the moduli cause serious cosmological problems , since the lifetime is typically longer than 1  sec and the energy density stored in the form of coherent oscillation is too much .",
    "the decay of moduli usually injects significant amount of energy after the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) begins , and it modifies subsequent cosmological scenarios .",
    "this is called the cosmological moduli problem  @xcite .",
    "even if the moduli are heavy enough to decay before bbn , gravitinos produced by the moduli decay again may be problematic  @xcite .",
    "thermal inflation  @xcite is a short period of inflation which takes place well after the primordial inflation .",
    "it is regarded as a solution to the cosmological moduli problem , since the coherent oscillation of the moduli is sufficiently diluted by the exponential expansion during thermal inflation and subsequent entropy - production by the flaton decay .",
    "thermal inflation is driven by a scalar field , called _ flaton _ , having a flat potential and trapped at the origin of the scalar potential due to thermal effects .",
    "this kind of scalar field can be embedded into supersymmetric ( susy ) theories .",
    "however , the most thermal inflation models suffer from a problematic domain wall ( dw ) formation after the phase transition in association with the end of thermal inflation  @xcite .",
    "this is because the flaton usually has @xmath0 symmetry which is spontaneously broken at the true vacuum .",
    "once formed , dws eventually dominate the energy density of the universe resulting in a cosmological disaster .",
    "thus the @xmath0 symmetry , which guarantees the flatness of the flaton potential , must be explicitly broken to some extent in order for the dws to disappear before they come to dominate the universe .",
    "actually , an introduction of a small explicit breaking in the scalar potential can solve the dw problem  @xcite .",
    "such dws can be a source of gravitational waves ( gws ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study the gws from the dynamics of dws produced after thermal inflation . we show that the amount of the gws may be within the reach of the pulsar timing experiments and future space - borne gw detectors .",
    "thus the study of gws provides a way to probe the period of thermal inflation .",
    "it is also shown that the @xmath0 can be naturally broken by the qcd instanton effect in a simple class of thermal inflation model ; in such a model , the abundance of the gws will be well within the observable range .",
    "let us start with the model of thermal inflation .",
    "we introduce a gauge singlet superfield @xmath1 which takes the role of the flaton .",
    "imposing @xmath0 symmetry , under which @xmath1 transforms as @xmath2 , we adopt the following superpotential are also allowed , but they have little effects on the flaton dynamics discussed below and hence are neglected . ]",
    "@xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are additional `` quarks '' which have quantum numbers for su(3)@xmath6 ; they are thermalized when @xmath7 , and give a thermal mass to @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , @xmath8 is a constant which is related to the gravitino mass @xmath9 as @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 being the reduced planck scale ) . in the following , in order to guarantee the flatness of the potential of @xmath1 , we take @xmath12",
    ". we also comment here that , if @xmath13 , the superpotential has an @xmath14-symmetry under which @xmath1 has a charge @xmath15 .",
    "although such an @xmath14-symmetry is explicitly broken by the constant term @xmath8 , we will be interested in the case that the effect of the breaking is relatively small .",
    "then , in the vacuum where @xmath16 , quasi nambu - goldstone boson , which we call @xmath14-axion , shows up",
    ".    including the susy breaking effect , the zero temperature potential of the flaton @xmath1 takes the following form : @xmath17 if there are no sources for the @xmath18-parameter other than @xmath8 , we have @xmath19 . the susy breaking mass parameter for @xmath1",
    "is represented by @xmath20 and is assumed to be negative .",
    "hereafter we take @xmath18 real and positive . in addition , we take @xmath21 for simplicity .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath1 is given by @xmath22 the flaton mass around the minimum is given by @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is determined as @xmath25 so that the cosmological constant vanishes at the vacuum . in the gravity - mediated susy breaking model , @xmath26 is expected to be of the order of tev . in the gauge - mediated susy breaking model  @xcite , on the other hand , the scalar potential is slightly more complicated  @xcite and the parameter dependence changes .",
    "hereafter , we treat @xmath27 and @xmath28 as free parameters without specifying the mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "suppose that @xmath1 is trapped at the origin due to the large hubble mass term during / after inflation .",
    "in such a period , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are massless and hence they participate to thermal bath .",
    "thus the flaton obtains a thermal mass of @xmath29 .",
    "as the cosmic temperature decreases , the energy density of the universe is dominated by the potential energy of @xmath1 and thermal inflation begins .",
    "thermal inflation ends at the temperature @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "then the flaton oscillates around the minimum , and finally it decays into radiation .",
    "we parametrize the flaton decay rate as @xmath32 with a numerical constant @xmath33 , which depends on the decay mode .",
    "if @xmath1 decays into the higgsino pair via the superpotential of @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the up- and down - type higgses , respectively ) with @xmath37 , then @xmath38 . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath39 for the decay into gluons via the loop effect .",
    "the reheating temperature after the flaton decay is estimated as - axion pair .",
    "if the decay into the @xmath14-axion is dominant , the final reheating completes by the decay of @xmath14-axion .",
    "this situation is effectively incorporated in the parametrization ( [ gamma ] ) by choosing the value of @xmath33 appropriately .",
    "in addition , the flatino , the fermionic component of the flaton , has a mass of @xmath40 , and hence the flaton can not decay into the flatino pair . ] @xmath41^{1/4 }    \\left ( \\frac{m_\\phi}{1{\\rm tev } } \\right)^{3/2 }    \\left ( \\frac{10^{10}{\\rm gev}}{v } \\right ) ,    \\label{tr}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the effective number of massless degrees of freedom at the temperature @xmath43 . notice that @xmath44 is required to be higher than a few mev for successful bbn .",
    "let us estimate the modulus abundance in the presence of thermal inflation .",
    "we denote the modulus field by @xmath45 and its mass and energy density by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "thermal inflation efficiently dilutes the moduli through the late - time entropy production .",
    "the dilution factor is defined as the ratio of the entropy with and without the additional entropy production at the flaton decay .",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the modulus abundance after the entropy production is @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial amplitude of the modulus .",
    "here we have assumed that the modulus begins to oscillate before the inflaton decays and also that the inflaton decays before thermal inflation starts .",
    "otherwise , the expression becomes more complicated  @xcite .",
    "we call this `` primary '' moduli for the reason discussed below",
    ".    there is another contribution to the modulus oscillation  @xcite .",
    "since the potential minimum of the moduli during thermal inflation may be displaced from the true minimum due to the hubble mass correction , the secondary oscillation is induced after thermal inflation ends .",
    "the amplitude is estimated as @xmath51 .",
    "hence the moduli abundance is estimated to be @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the true minimum of the modulus while the origin is chosen so that the hubble mass correction is given by @xmath54 .",
    "this is called the `` secondary '' moduli .",
    "the final modulus abundance is the sum of the primary and secondary moduli .",
    "which one dominates the moduli density depends on various parameters .",
    "bbn , cosmic microwave background , and diffuse @xmath55- and @xmath56-ray background give stringent upper bound on the modulus abundance , depending on its mass .",
    "complete analyses on the modulus abundance and its cosmological effects can be found in ref .",
    "in this section we discuss the problematic dw formation after thermal inflation , and a solution to the dw problem .",
    "after the decay , the flaton randomly falls into one of the @xmath57-degenerate minima .",
    "since the vev of @xmath1 spontaneously breaks the @xmath58-symmetry , dws are formed after thermal inflation .",
    "the dw tension is estimated as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 gives the @xmath14-axion mass .",
    "dws obey the scaling low in which about one dw exists per hubble horizon as far as the viscosity on the dw is negligible  @xcite . and @xmath62 cause friction , but this effect is found to be insignificant for the following analysis .",
    "] then dws begin to dominate the universe at @xmath63 this is problematic unless @xmath64 , since otherwise dws dominate the universe before the present epoch  @xcite .",
    "thus there should be an explicit @xmath58 breaking term which makes dws unstable .",
    "let us denote the @xmath0-breaking scalar potential by @xmath65 , whose possible origins will be discussed later . it generates a bias for the @xmath57 minima of the original potential and the degeneracy among those minima are lifted completely .",
    "dws are not absolutely stable under the existence of the bias , and eventually collapse when the bias energy density becomes comparable to the dw energy density  @xcite .",
    "this happens when @xmath66 therefore , in order for the dws to collapse before they come to dominate ( @xmath67 ) , we need the following condition , @xmath68 the dw problem is solved if this condition is satisfied .",
    "now we describe possible origins of the bias term .",
    "let us introduce the following superpotential @xmath69 in addition to ( [ w ] ) , where @xmath57 and @xmath70 are relatively prime numbers and @xmath71 is a small coefficient .",
    "in order for this term not to change the flaton potential significantly , we require @xmath72 then the following additional scalar potentials are generated , @xmath73 the second term dominates for @xmath74 and this yields the bias for the @xmath57 minima of the original potential as @xmath75 the original @xmath0 symmetry is explicitly violated by the bias , and hence the degeneracy of the @xmath57 minima of the scalar potential is broken .",
    "the condition ( [ veps_sigma ] ) is rewritten as @xmath76 if this condition is satisfied , dws collapse before they come to dominate the universe and there is no dw problem .",
    "rather simple scenario to break the @xmath0 symmetry is to use the qcd instanton effects  @xcite .",
    "this is economical in the sense that the term @xmath77 in ( [ w ] ) , which is needed for giving rise to a thermal mass for the flaton field , also works as a source of the bias for eliminating the dws .",
    "have a charge of _ hidden _ qcd and its scale is around gev - tev . ]    the @xmath0 symmetry in ( [ w ] ) has an anomaly for su(3)@xmath6 .",
    "consequently , the qcd instanton effect works as a bias , which lifts the classical degeneracy of the @xmath57 vacua",
    ". the bias due to this effect is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath78 for temperature below @xmath79mev , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the pion decay constant and mass , and @xmath82 is the current mass of the up ( down ) quark . at higher temperature ,",
    "this effect is suppressed by high powers of @xmath43  @xcite , and hence the bias due to the qcd instanton effect is only turned on at @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "we need two conditions for this mechanism to work successfully .",
    "one is eq .",
    "( [ veps_sigma ] ) for dws collapse due to the bias .",
    "the other is @xmath84 , since otherwise the qcd instanton effect is highly suppressed and it is not suitable for the bias .",
    "these two conditions are written as @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , for example , @xmath87gev and @xmath88gev are good choices for @xmath89 . in this choice",
    "we have @xmath90 .",
    "as will be seen , this predicts observable gws .",

    "<S> thermal inflation is an attractive solution to the cosmological moduli problem . however , domain walls may be formed after thermal inflation and some mechanisms are needed to eliminate the domain wall before it dominates the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that gravitational waves produced by the dynamics of domain walls may be observed by the pulsar timing experiments and future space - borne gravitational wave detectors , which provides a probe into the period of thermal inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the qcd instanton effect can effectively eliminate the domain walls with producing observable amount of gravitational waves .    </S>",
