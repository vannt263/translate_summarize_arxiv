    "the @xmath0 emission is one of the decay channels of the heavy nuclei .",
    "measurements on the @xmath0 decay can provide reliable information on the nuclear structure such as the ground - state energy , the ground - state half - life , the nuclear spin and parity , the nuclear deformation , the nuclear clustering , the shell effects and the nuclear interaction @xcite .",
    "measurements on the @xmath0 decay are also used to identify new nuclides or new heavy elements since the @xmath0 decay allows to extract clear and reliable information on the parent nucleus @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in the @xmath0 decay has been renewed because of the development of radioactive beams and new detector technology under low temperature .",
    "the @xmath0 decay process was first explained by gamow and by condon and gurney in the 1920s @xcite as a quantum - tunneling effect and is one of the first examples proving the need to use the quantum mechanics to describe the nuclear phenomena and its correctness .",
    "later on , theoretical calculations were performed to predict the absolute @xmath0 decay width , to extract nuclear structure information , and to pursue a microscopic understanding of the @xmath0-decay phenomenon .",
    "these studies are based on various theoretical models such as the shell model , the fissionlike model , and the cluster model @xcite . in the @xmath0 cluster model ,",
    "the decay constant @xmath3 is the product of three terms : the cluster preformation probability @xmath4 , the assault frequency @xmath5 and the barrier penetrability p. the @xmath0 particle emission is a quantum tunnelling through the potential barrier leading from the mother nucleus to the two emitted fragments : the @xmath0 particle and the daughter nucleus .",
    "the penetrability can be described successfully using the wkb approximation .",
    "the most important problem of the @xmath0 decay is how to estimate the preformation probability @xmath4 that the @xmath0 particle exists as a recognizable entity inside the nucleus before its emission .",
    "it is very dependent on the structure of the states of the mother and daughter nuclei and is a measure of the degree of resemblance between the initial state of the mother nucleus and the final state of the daughter nucleus plus the @xmath0 particle . within an asymmetric fission picture",
    "the preformation factor p@xmath6 has been taken as 1 in previous studies and that allows to reproduce the experimental @xmath0 decay half - lives @xcite when the experimental @xmath7 values are used .",
    "there are , however , still small differences between the calculated and experimental values and these discrepancies may be used to determine the @xmath0-preformation probability .",
    "the @xmath0 preformation factor is very important from the viewpoint of the nuclear structure .",
    "numerous studies of the @xmath0 decay have been concentrated on this problem @xcite .",
    "there are also several approaches to calculate the formation amplitude : the shell model , the bcs method @xcite , the hybrid ( shell model+@xmath0-cluster ) model @xcite etc .",
    "the effect of continuum states on the @xmath0 decay is known to be very large @xcite .",
    "one needs therefore very large shell model basis to obtain the experimental values of the @xmath0-preformation probability .",
    "the hybrid model @xcite , which treats a large shell model basis up to the continuum states through the wavefunction of the spatially localized @xmath0 cluster , explains well the experimental decay width . in these calculations",
    "the wave function is necessary , and it is not easy to extend the approaches for nuclei including more nucleons outside the double - magic core .    in this contribution , the preformation factor is extracted from the experimental @xmath0 decay half - life @xmath8 and the penetration probability is obtained from the wkb approximation .",
    "the potential barrier is determined within a generalized liquid drop model ( gldm ) including the proximity effects between the @xmath0 particle and the daughter nucleus and adjusted to reproduce the experimental q@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the methods for calculating the assault frequencies , the penetrability of the even - even nuclei and the preformation factor are presented .",
    "the calculated results are shown and discussed in sec .",
    "3 . in the last section ,",
    "the conclusions are given and future works are proposed .",
    "the @xmath0 decay constant is defined as @xmath10 imagining the @xmath0 particle moving back and forth inside the nucleus with a velocity @xmath11 , it presents itself at the barrier with a frequency : @xmath12 r is the radius of the parent nucleus given by @xmath13 and e@xmath9 is the energy of the alpha particle , corrected for recoil ; @xmath14 being its mass .",
    "the penetration probability p is calculated within the wkb approximation .",
    "the potential barrier governing the @xmath0 emission is determined within the gldm , including the volume , surface , coulomb and proximity energies @xcite : @xmath15 when the nuclei are separated : @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass numbers , charge numbers , radii and relative neutron excesses of the two nuclei .",
    "@xmath23 is the distance between the mass centres .",
    "the radii @xmath24 are given by eq .",
    "( [ radii ] ) .    for one - body shapes , the surface and coulomb energies are defined as @xcite : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 is the surface of the one - body deformed nucleus .",
    "@xmath28 is the electrostatic potential at the surface and @xmath29 the surface potential of the sphere .",
    "the surface energy results from the effects of the surface tension forces in a half space . when there are nucleons in regard in a neck or a gap between separated fragments an additional term called proximity energy must be added to take into account the effects of the nuclear forces between the close surfaces .",
    "this term is essential to describe smoothly the one - body to two - body transition and to obtain reasonable fusion barrier heights .",

    "the combination of the gldm and of a quasi - molecular shape sequence has allowed to reproduce the fusion barrier heights and radii , the fission and the @xmath0 and cluster radioactivity data .",

    "the decay constant may be deduced from the experimental @xmath0 decay half - life @xmath8 by @xmath44 the preformation factor @xmath4 of an @xmath0 cluster inside the mother nucleus can be estimated inserting eq.([mu ] ) , eq.([penetrability ] ) and eq.([lamda2 ] ) in eq.([lamda1 ] ) .",
    "the values of the decay constant @xmath3 , the velocity , the assault frequency @xmath5 , the penetrability p and the preformation factor p@xmath6 are given for the even - even pb , po , rn , ra , th and u isotopes in the tables 1 and 2 .    in the simple picture of an @xmath0",
    "particle moving with a kinetic energy e@xmath9 inside the nucleus , the order of magnitude of the @xmath0 velocity @xmath45 is 1.0@xmath4610@xmath47 fm / s for all considered nuclei .",
    "the order of magnitude of the assault frequency @xmath5 calculated by eq.([lamda1 ] ) is 1.0@xmath4610@xmath48 both in the table 1 and the table 2 .",
    "the variations of @xmath45 and @xmath5 are small . in the previous study relative to the @xmath0 decay half - lives using the gldm @xcite , the assault frequency @xmath5",
    "is fixed as 1.0@xmath4610@xmath49 , which is smaller by one order of magnitude than the value obtained in the present calculation , meaning that an averaged preformation factor of 0.1 has been included in the previous @xmath0 decay study .",
    "so the previous calculations are consistent quantitatively with the experimental data in general .",
    "a fixed value of the assault frequency can not describe the detailed features of the nuclear structure and the last column of the tables 1 and 2 displays the extracted preformation factor p@xmath6 when the eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) is assumed . to study the correlation between the preformation factors and the structure properties , the preformation factors of pb , po , rn , ra , th , and u isotopes are given as a function of the neutron number n in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the preformation factors of the isotopes generally decrease with increasing neutron number up to the spherical shell closure n=126 , where the minimum of p@xmath6 occurs , and then they increase quickly with the neutron number .",
    "the values of the preformation factors is always minimum for the po , rn , ra , th , and u isotopes when n=126 .",
    "the preformation factors of n=126 isotones are shown in fig .",
    "the preformation factors increase when the proton number goes away from the magic number z=82 .",
    "the maximum values of the preformation factor for the five elements , which correspond to the most neutron - rich nucleus from po to u isotopes respectively , are presented in fig.[fig3 ] . in general , the values increase with the proton number . from @xmath50th to @xmath51u ,",
    "the value of the preformation factor decreases apparently , even if the proton number z is far from the magic number z=82 .",
    "the neutron number of @xmath51u ( n=146 ) is closer to the submagic neutron number n=152 than that of the nucleus @xmath50th ( n=142 ) ; so the preformation factor of @xmath50th is larger than that of the nucleus @xmath51u . as a conclusion the shell closure effects play the key role in the @xmath0 formation mechanism . the more the nucleon number is close to the magic numbers , the more the formation of the @xmath0 cluster inside the mother nucleus is difficult .",
    "the ground - state spin and parity of even - even nuclei is 0@xmath52 and the @xmath0 decay of even - even nuclei mainly proceeds to the ground state of the daughter nucleus . though the parent nucleus may also decay to the excited states of the daughter nucleus , the probability is very small and it can be neglected for a systematic study of penetrability .",
    "the calculated penetrabilities are given in the seventh column in the tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the values of the penetrability vary in a wide range from 10@xmath53 to 10@xmath54 for the even - even isotopes of pb , po , rn , ra , th , and u , implying that the penetrability plays the key role to determine the @xmath0 decay half - lives .",

    "particle emission is easier than that of the other nuclei of the same isotopes .",
    "the closed shell structures play also the key role for the penetrability mechanism .",
    "the more the nucleon number is far away from the nucleon magic numbers , the more the penetrability of the @xmath0 cluster from mother nucleus becomes larger .",
    "the values of the @xmath0 decay constant @xmath3 deduced from the experimental half - lives are shown in the fourth column of the tables 1 and 2 for the even - even isotopes of pb , po , rn , ra , th , and u. in order to clarify the relations between the decay constant @xmath3 , the preformation factor p@xmath6 , the assault frequency @xmath5 and the penetrability p , the values of log@xmath55(p@xmath6 ) , log@xmath55(@xmath5 ) , log@xmath55(p ) , and log@xmath56 are displayed as functions of the neutron number n for po isotopes in the fig .",

    ", the formation factor decreases with the increase of the mass number a. it can be understand easily that the theoretical @xmath0 decay gldm half - lives are very slightly higher than the experimental data for the light nuclei and lower for the heaviest systems , when the preformation factors are neglected .",
    "the preformation factors decrease with mass number till about 210 , then , the preformation factors jump nearly one order of magnitude , and finally decrease again , due to the neutron number n=126 in this mass region .",

    "the preformation factors are not constant for these nuclei , and show regular law for the studied isotopes .",
    "clearly the closed shell structures play the key role for the preformation mechanism , and the more the nucleon number is close to the magic nucleon numbers , the more the preformation of @xmath0 cluster is difficult inside the mother nucleus .",

    "the penetrability determines mainly the behaviour of the decay constant .",
    "the study is extended to the even - even superheavy nuclei .",
    "the penetration probabilities are relatively very large and its range is narrow for the heaviest nuclei .",
    "so it is easy for the @xmath0 particle to escape from these nuclei as soon as they are formed , confirming that the superheavy nuclei are weakly bound .",
    "thus , it is interesting and timely to study the preformation factors microscopically and systematically .",
    "it is also desired to extend the study to the odd a and odd - odd nuclei and extract possibly analytical formulas of preformation factors , which should be functions of the nucleon numbers and the @xmath0 decay energy .",
