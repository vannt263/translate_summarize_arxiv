    "the relaxation time @xmath0 for the decay of any dissipative flux in a hydrodynamic system is often misunderstood and uncritically assumed to vanish ( an unphysical assumption ) or be of the order of the relevant collision time @xmath1 of the particles making up the fluid -for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "the root of this confusion may be traced to the great success of the fourier - navier - stokes theory of dissipative transport @xcite .",
    "this venerable theory is very useful for engineering applications , but it ignores altogether the relaxation times taken by the system to return to thermodynamic equilibrium state once the gradients of temperature , fluid velocity and so on are suddenly turned off , and therefore its range of validity is limited ( at most ) to steady - state situations @xcite .",
    "therefore , this theory displays a serious drawback : the prediction of instantaneous propagation of the dissipative signals which , on physical grounds , should be limited by the speed of sound .",
    "this fact becomes important when dealing with relativistic self  gravitating fluid distributions such as a collapsing star , as well as for the early universe ( see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "obviously @xmath0 and @xmath1 ought to be related to one another , however there is no generic rule on how to find such a relationship since it depends in each case on the particular system under consideration .    in a previous paper we studied the matter - radiation decoupling for an expanding inhomogeneous universe described by new exact solutions",

    "ii we present our model , recall the exact solution derived in @xcite , and compare the aforesaid relaxation time with the collision time between photons and electrons before the matter - radiation decoupling is achieved .",
    "section iii summarizes our conclusions .",
    "cosmic matter sources in the period from the end of cosmic nucleosynthesis to the decoupling of matter and radiation ( roughly the temperature range @xmath2 ) can be characterized as a mixture of ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic particles ( `` radiation '' and `` matter '' ) , subjected to a tight interaction via various radiative processes ( hence the name `` radiative '' era ) .",
    "the usual approach for studying this era is to consider a flrw space - time background where matter sources are described by : ( a ) equilibrium kinetic theory , ( b ) gauge invariant perturbations , or ( c ) by hydrodynamical models , which , in general , fail to incorporate a physically plausible description of the matter - radiation interaction . examination of these matter sources in an inhomogeneous hydrodynamic context requires an imperfect fluid whose state variables are compatible with the equation of state of a mixture of a non - relativistic gas ( matter ) and a extreme relativistic one ( radiation ) . in @xcite",
    "we derived a class of exact solutions along these lines , so that : ( a ) matter - radiation radiative interaction was modeled by a dissipative shear - stress tensor , ( b ) only the evolution along the radiative era was considered , ( c ) the background space - time was described by the ltb metric with flat spacelike slices :    @xmath3\\ , , \\quad y = y(t , r ) .",

    "the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 follows by assuming that the matter component is  dust \" ( the low temperature limit of a classical ideal gas , hence its pressure can be neglected ) and therefore the hydrostatic pressure is furnished by the radiation only , i.e. @xmath13 where the superscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the particle number densities of `` matter '' and `` radiation '' .",

    "the subscript @xmath18 in @xmath17 indicates that we use the form of this coefficient provided by kinetic theory for the electron - photon interaction ( the `` radiative gas '' model ) .",
    "this transport equation is compatible with relativistic causality and stability , and is supported by kinetic theory , statistical fluctuation theory , and information theory @xcite . in its turn the expression for @xmath17 is well  known in the literature and it can be derived from different standpoints @xcite .",
    "the entropy per particle takes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the equilibrium photon entropy per baryon , and we have used the fact that the number of particles of each fluid entering the mixture is independently conserved : @xmath22 , as well as @xmath23 . the positive  definite nature of @xmath24 and @xmath0 above is crucial for the theory to comply with relativistic causality , notwithstanding the unjustified and widespread belief that @xmath0 vanishes altogether or is at most of the order of the collision time .",

    "it is expedient to point out first that no expression exists that gives @xmath0 solely in terms of the macroscopic variables ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath47 , n , etc . ) , i.e. , there is not such thing as an  equation of state \" for @xmath0 .",
    "secondly , using the kinetic theory of gases ( in general ) the collision time ( not @xmath0 ) could in principle be written as a collision integral , but that expression would be mathematically untractable .",

    "@xmath62 matter and radiation no longer interact between each other .",
    "choosing as initial time @xmath63 roughly corresponding to @xmath64 kelvin , the evolution of the models crucially depends on initial conditions specified by the useful quantity @xmath65 ( formally analogous to the definition of adiabatic perturbations ) . as shown in @xcite",
    "( see also figure 3 of this paper ) , the collision time @xmath66 is quite insensitive to the values of @xmath67 given by initial conditions , therefore for some some @xmath68 we find that @xmath66 overcomes @xmath69 , i.e. there is always a decoupling hypersurface . taking the standard decoupling temperature @xmath70 , numerical evaluation of @xmath71 where @xmath72 is given by ( [ psi ] )",
    "leads to @xmath73 . also , observational constraints on the decoupling hypersurface @xmath74_{d } \\approx 10^{-5}$ ] further restrict the maximum values of both @xmath75 and @xmath76 to about @xmath77 .",
    "however , @xmath0 is very sensitive to @xmath67 , for example , only if @xmath78 ( i.e. for adiabatic initial conditions ) @xmath0 has an adequate asymptotic evolution , in the sense that as @xmath79 ( and so , @xmath80 ) it grows monotonically ( as @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 in this limit , though @xmath0 in this case remains smaller than @xmath69 for all the evolution as @xmath79 , a very different behavior from that of @xmath66 which overtakes @xmath69 at the decoupling surface .",
    "the relaxation time for adiabatic initial conditions is then unphysical near the decoupling surface . for non - adiabatic intial conditions , @xmath83 , if @xmath84 and @xmath85 hold , we can have @xmath86 for non  vanishing @xmath87 , therefore @xmath0 diverges and overtakes @xmath69 , a behavior that is qualitatively analogous to that of @xmath66 . in order to have @xmath0 overtaking @xmath69 at @xmath88 , we find that @xmath67 can not be greater than approximately @xmath89 ( quasi - adiabatic initial conditions ) .",
    "therefore , under the assumptions of eit and using the full transport equation ( [ pitensor ] ) and @xmath0 given by ( [ tau ] ) , we find that initial conditions do exist so that @xmath0 has a physicaly reasonable form near the decoupling surface .",

    "as a consequence @xmath95_{i } \\approx 5/16 $ ] while @xmath96_{i } \\approx 10^{-6}$ ] .",
    "as the decoupling hypersurface is approached ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) @xmath72 and @xmath98 slightly depart from unity as depicted in figure 1 . on that hypersurface",
    "one has @xmath99 seconds .",
    "figure 2 shows how sensitive is the latter quantity to @xmath67 .",
    "we see therefore that contrary to the usual belief , the model examined in @xcite shows that @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath66 for most of the radiative era and the timescales @xmath100 become comparable only as the decoupling hypersurface is approached .",
    "this behavior is shown in figure 3 depicting the ratios @xmath101 and @xmath102 as well their dependence on @xmath103 .      in many cases , just for the sake of mathematical simplicity , the transport equation ( [ pitensor ] ) governing",
    "the evolution of the dissipative stress tensor has been replaced in by the more manageable maxwell  cattaneo  like expression , namely the so called `` truncated '' transport equation @xmath104 an equation still complying with relativistic causality and stability in the sense mentioned earlier , and justified when the four  dimensional gradient of the combination @xmath105 becomes negligibly small .",
    "the models presented here provide a theoretical context in which to test how suitable can this truncated transport equation be for studying the evolution of an interactive matter  radiation mixture . to do this consider the relaxation time that follows from ( [ namely ] ) @xmath106 - \\frac{1}{5 } \\sigma[31(4 + 3 \\delta_{i}^{(r ) } ) - 15 \\gamma ] } , \\label{taumc}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 is the relaxation time associated with the maxwell  cattaneo equation . comparing ( [ taumc ] ) with the relaxation time ( [ tau ] )",
    "that emerges from the full theory ( i.e. from ( [ pitensor ] ) ) @xmath108^{2}+ \\frac{171}{256 } \\gamma^{2}}. \\label{tauf}\\ ] ] we can see that @xmath109 , therefore since @xmath110 ( as long as @xmath111 , which is always the case ) we have @xmath112 . now",
    "two possibilities arise :    1 .",
    "@xmath113 , in this case figure 4 shows that @xmath114 for the whole evolution .",
    "2 .   @xmath115 , in this case as seen from figure 5 , @xmath107 does not diverge nor overtakes @xmath116 at any time in the whole evolution , while @xmath0 diverges and overtakes @xmath116 for @xmath117 .",
    "this together with the fact that close to the decoupling surface @xmath66 becomes larger than @xmath107 it follows that the maxwell  cattaneo equation ( [ namely ] ) applied to the ltb models derived here and under the constraints imposed on the initial density contrasts ( @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) by the observed cmb anisotropies , does not provide a relaxation time that behaves reasonably in conditions near the matter  radiation decoupling .",
    "it is widely assumed nowadays that the bulk of the matter of the universe ( about ninety percent ) is not baryonic but belongs to some hitherto unknown form of  dark matter \" ( see e.g. @xcite ) -though voices of dissent can be heard @xcite .",
    "we have considered a baryon ",
    "photon mixture and so have not taken this into account in our calculations .",
    "however , we can roughly verify to what extent our results would change had we incorporated some form of this missing matter .",
    "if we assume that it is mostly non  relativistic and that it amounts to @xmath120 times the baryon abundance , the inclusion of such missing matter corresponds to decreasing the value of the parameter @xmath121 by a factor of @xmath120 ( from @xmath122 down to @xmath123 ) . as shown in figure 6 , carrying on this modification does not imply a dramatical change in our results .",
    "further , it is worthwhile remarking that the introduction of a small cosmological constant or a quintessence fluid would not make sense for the models we are dealing with .",
    "since these forms of  dark energy \" contributions ( as it is nowadays in vogue ) are used to explain the alleged accelerated expansion of the present day universe , they should be sub ",
    "dominants at the epcoch contemplated in this paper ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that the main results of this paper : ( a ) inadequacy of the truncated equation ( [ namely ] ) to provide a relaxation time that behaves reasonably near matter - radiation decoupling , and ( b ) that @xmath0 is much larger than @xmath66 for most of the radiative era , strictly apply for the specific model examined in @xcite , based on the ltb metric .",
    "these results also rely on the expression of @xmath0 obtained in terms of the transport equations ( [ pitensor ] ) and ( [ namely ] ) . however , we argue that in spite of these limitations these results can complement and enrich the existing discussion in the literature concerning the adequacy of truncated transport equations of dissipative stresses in a cosmological context -see @xcite and references therein .",
    "our analysis suggests that , in any case , these equations should be used with due care .",
    "we believe it is important to stress that ( as far as we are aware ) these important features of the equations of irreversible thermodynamics have not been examined previously in the context of inhomogeneous metrics able to accommodate dissipative shear stresses .",
