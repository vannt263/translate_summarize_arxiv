    "broad absorption line quasars ( bals ) are one of the most enigmatic varieties of quasars .",
    "resonance lines of ordinary ions , , , , , and others  are seen in absorption that spreads , often in highly irregular fashion , as much as 60,000  km  s@xmath2  from line - center in the quasar rest - frame to the blueward .",
    "previous surveys ( e.g. the large bright quasar survey , or lbqs : @xcite ) have shown that bals , while a minority of all quasars , are not rare ; a population fraction @xmath3 is typically estimated .",
    "because few of their other properties are grossly different from ordinary quasars , it is generally thought that all quasars have bal material , but it covers only a fraction of solid angle around the quasar nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , subtleties of selection can complicate the inference of covering fraction from population fraction @xcite .",
    "numerous technical difficulties have retarded growth in our understanding of bals .",
    "known cases are relatively rare , numbering less than @xmath4 , not solely because they are a minority of the general population but also because they are readily found only when their characteristic features are red - shifted from their rest - frame wavelengths in the ultraviolet into the visible band . consequently , only those quasars found in somewhat special redshift intervals can be easily searched for broad absorption .",
    "it is hard to statistically characterize those bals that are found because the methods used to discover them often involve some level of subjectivity that is hard to quantify .",
    "even if their selection were easier to articulate , there appears to be so much variation in their properties ( profile shapes , relative line strengths , etc . )",
    "that it is hard to grasp which properties are generic and which are  accidental \" .",
    "the quasar sample being compiled by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite ) offers a way out of this impasse .",
    "when complete , it will be both very large ( @xmath5 in all ) and selected in a uniform and quantifiable manner . in future work",
    ", we hope to present statistical analysis of bals in this entire sample . here",
    "we offer a preliminary installment on this project in the form of a more modest bal sample drawn from the first data released from the project to public view , the early data release ( edr : @xcite ) .",
    "several collections of bals have already been drawn from early sloan data @xcite ; these were , however , oriented toward  by - eye \" selection of small subsamples special in some way ( radio - loud in the former case , extraordinary profiles in the latter ) .",
    "the work reported here differs in that it is the first attempt to create a systematically - selected sample from the sdss .    from the edr",
    ", @xcite created a quasar catalog containing 3814 quasars , selected ( mostly ) on the basis of their location in four - color space and on a ( mostly ) uniform @xmath6-magnitude limit . in order to present more clearly - defined statistics ,",
    "we have refined this sample so that it is almost homogeneously - selected ( see  2.1 ) . within that sub - sample ( about 80% of the full edr quasar catalog ) , roughly one - quarter ( 796 ) fall within the redshift range within which it is feasible to search for bal features .    with an eye toward the homogeneity of selection to be achieved in the full sdss , we invented an automated bal selection algorithm that processes sdss spectral data in a uniform way and identifies bal quasars in a uniform manner ( see  2.2 ) . using this algorithm ,",
    "we have identified 116 bal quasars , whose statistical properties are discussed in  3 .",
    "although the edr represents a tiny fraction of the ultimate sdss quasar sample , the bal sample so derived is now the largest ( as well as the most homogeneously selected ) such sample known .",
    "the edr quasar catalog @xcite was compiled by applying several different selection criteria ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "most of its objects were chosen on the basis of colors lying outside the  stellar locus \" in the four - color space formed by the sloan five - filter ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath6 , and @xmath10 ) photometry , etc . in this paper ,",
    "all such magnitudes should be understood in that sense , although we will forgo making the distinction explicit . ] .",
    "however , roughly 20% of the quasars in this list were chosen in a much less well - defined fashion ( in the jargon of the sdss , these were selected for the  serendipity \" sample ) .",
    "in addition , much smaller numbers of quasars were selected not on the basis of their photometric colors , but because they were close in the sky to known radio sources in the first catalog @xcite or x - ray sources in the rosat all - sky survey @xcite . for the purposes of this paper , which concentrates on statistics , we have pruned the edr quasar catalog to include _",
    "only _ those flagged as quasar candidates by a color - based targetting algorithm .",
    "because the edr data were compiled during the test - year of the project , the color - based selection algorithm was not the same throughout . with regard to issues relevant here , the variations can be reduced to two slightly different versions , very nearly equal in sky coverage . in both ,",
    "the primary flux limit was @xmath11  mag .",
    "mag in some cases , @xmath12  mag in others ; because so few objects are near the bright limit , the change makes essentially no difference to sample statistics . ]",
    "both versions also shared the same primary color criterion : select only those objects whose colors lie at least @xmath13 away from the stellar locus .",
    "an exception was made to this rule in order to cope with the fact that at redshifts @xmath14  3.0 , quasars have colors nearly indistinguishable from those of a and/or f type stars @xcite . in this portion of the stellar locus ,",
    "quasar candidates were selected , but at lower efficiency ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; g.t .",
    "richards , private communication ) .",
    "the two versions differed in two ways : one version rejected objects with colors approximating those of a stars ; in the other , objects with colors similar to those of hot white dwarfs or unresolved m dwarf - white dwarf pairs were also removed from the quasar candidate list .",
    "in addition , in those runs in which white - dwarf - like colors were rejected , a special procedure was adopted in order to enhance sensitivity to quasars with @xmath15 . to find more of these quasars , the magnitude limit was relaxed to @xmath16 in the region of four - color space where previously - located high - redshift quasars were found .",
    "we will show below that these variations in quasar candidate selection had negligible effects on bal quasar discovery .",
    "quasar candidates were labelled as  quasars \" by the spectroscopic pipeline if the crosscorrelation between their spectra and a quasar template spectrum was greater than the crosscorrelation with any of the other templates ( stars , galaxies , etc . ) . for confirmation",
    ", objects were required to pass two further tests : that their spectra possess at least one emission line with fwhm @xmath17  km  s@xmath2 ; and that their absolute magnitude @xmath18 ( for @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 and @xmath20 )",
    ".    in the full edr quasar catalog , there were 3814 objects .",
    "our sample contains only the 3107 identified by one of the two versions of the color - selection rules .",
    "the line is centered at 1550    in the rest - frame , so it appears in the sdss spectra ( which nominally cover the wavelength range from 39009100   ) only for redshifts @xmath21 .",
    "however , several effects limit this range further .",
    "first , although the nominal blue cut - off is 3900   , in practice , throughput , and therefore signal / noise , drop sharply shortward of @xmath22    and ( more gradually ) longward of @xmath23   .",
    "moreover , in order to measure possible absorption to the blue of line - center , we must be able to see some line - free continuum to the redward of the emission line - center and also follow the line far enough to the blue that we are confident we have defined the entire absorption profile .",
    "these requirements restrict the permissible range of redshifts to roughly @xmath0 , cutting our sample size to 796 objects .",
    "redshifts supplied by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline are typically accurate to @xmath24  km  s@xmath2  , which suffices for the cut described in the previous paragraph , but is not accurate enough for absorption line measurement .",
    "these measurements require greater accuracy because the classical definition of bals @xcite counts only absorption at least 3000  km  s@xmath2  to the blue of line - center in the rest - frame .",
    "the emission line can not be used to define the redshift to this level of accuracy because the very absorption we are interested in can cut into the emission line so severely that it is unclear where line - center occurs .",
    "instead , we define the quasar rest - frame in terms of the ]  1909 emission line  km  s@xmath2 from the systemic host redshift as defined by [ 5007 ] . for similar reasons",
    ", @xcite used a weighted mean of the , , and emission lines to determine their redshifts . ] . to determine the redshift this way",
    ", we fit a gaussian plus a linear component to the measured flux in the ( pipeline - redshift ) rest - frame wavelength range 1860  1960   .",
    "the center of the gaussian in the best fit we take to define the true observed wavelength for rest - frame 1909   .    to search for absorption  which can be extremely difficult in these objects , in which emission and absorption features can occupy most of the spectrum ",
    "one must first locate the continuum .",
    "our solution to this problem is to first fit a power - law to the continuum data in five line - free windows : 17901820   , 19752000   , 21402155   , 22402255   , and 22652695   . holding that component fixed",
    ", we then fit a half - gaussian to the red half of the emission feature lying above the fitted continuum , taking line - center as 1549.5    in the rest - frame ( this wavelength derived by equally weighting the two components of this doublet ) .",
    "we deliberately ignore the blue half of the emission line so as to avoid confusion by absorption ; the continuum windows are chosen so as to avoid contamination by the  1640 , ]  1909 , and  2800 emission lines , as well as from various emission complexes .",
    "we then extrapolate the power - law portion of this fit to define the continuum blueward of 1550   .",
    "the final step in our procedure is to compute the  balnicity index \" for each quasar in this redshift range , following the definition given in @xcite : @xmath25 where the measured flux per unit wavelength is @xmath26 , the extrapolated fitted continuum is @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is a function whose value is unity when the quantity between parentheses has been positive for at least 2000  km  s@xmath2  to the red of the current wavelength and zero otherwise . the lower - limit on the integral is designed to avoid confusion with the line , the upper - limit to exclude associated absorption .",
    "comparison is made to 0.9 times the continuum rather than the full continuum to be conservative with respect to noise features .",
    "the function @xmath28 ensures that only truly broad features are counted . in effect , the balnicity index amounts to a sort of equivalent width .",
    "following weymann et al .",
    ", we declare a quasar to be a bal when its balnicity index is greater than zero .",
    "in view of the preliminary nature of this sample , here we present only a few tentative results .",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the numbers presented here will be substantially reduced in the far larger full sdss sample ; that sample will also enable other , more detailed studies .      of the 796 quasars in the redshift range where we can search for bals",
    ", we find that 116 , or @xmath1 are bals .",
    "the apparent bal fraction in this sample is also strongly dependent upon redshift ( fig .",
    "[ balfrac ] ) : it is only @xmath29 in the redshift range @xmath30 , but rises to @xmath31 near @xmath32 , and averages @xmath33 for @xmath34 .    some of this redshift dependence may be real , but there are also redshift - dependent systematic effects . near @xmath35 , some bals may be lost due to the relatively poor s / n at the blue end of the spectrograph . in the range @xmath36 ,",
    "distinguishing quasars and stars by color becomes difficult .",
    "both the broad absorption itself and intrinsic differences in continuum shape (  3.3 ) can give bals colors different from ordinary quasars ; their selection efficiencies can therefore differ significantly in this redshift range .",
    "the spike in the  raw \" bal fraction near @xmath32 may be the result of this differential selection efficiency ( see @xcite for further exploration of this issue ) .    on the other hand , dividing the sample according to the color - selection procedure used",
    ", we find negligible differences .",
    "both bal and ordinary quasar selection efficiencies were equal to well within poisson errors .",
    "the lbqs found a significantly smaller  raw \" fraction ( 9% ) , but weymann et al .",
    "corrected this figure to @xmath37 because the bal itself removed enough flux that many bal quasars dropped below the survey flux - limit . in the sdss , by contrast",
    ", the flux - limit is applied in the @xmath6-band , near 8500   . only for redshifts",
    "@xmath38 would a 1550 bal influence the @xmath6-band flux , and we do not even consider such high - redshift quasars in the sample at hand .",
    "consequently , the sdss bal fraction needs to be corrected for this effect only at very high redshift or for the special case of  lobals \" , bal quasars with absorption in the 2800 line .",
    "when absorption is present , the bal would remove flux from the @xmath6-band when @xmath14 .",
    "overall , then , particularly for @xmath39 , the sdss appears to find a somewhat larger bal fraction than the lbqs .",
    "allowing for the various systematic errors , our best preliminary estimate is a bal fraction @xmath40 ",
    "20% for this redshift range , but possibly nearer 10 ",
    "12% for @xmath30 .",
    "we expect these numbers to be refined as the statistics improve and the systematic effects become better understood . using the full sdss quasar sample it should become possible to search for genuine redshift- ( or luminosity- ) dependence in the bal fraction .",
    "the bi distribution for our sample is shown in figure  [ bidist ] .",
    "the plot shows @xmath41 = \\log[bi dn / d(bi)]$ ] ; within the loose constraints placed by relatively small sample size , there are roughly equal numbers of objects in equal logarithmic bins .",
    "however , we stress that the shape of this distribution below @xmath24  km  s@xmath2 is strongly dependent upon the arbitrary velocity offset parameter used in the definition of balnicity to distinguish  associated absorbers \" from truly  broad \" absorption ( cf . the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the shape of this distribution has several interesting implications .",
    "first , because bals of very small bi are common , the arbitrariness of the velocity offset parameter means that the distinction between weak bals and  associated absorbers \" is difficult to mark and the nominal bi for these objects likely underestimates the  physical \" absorption .",
    "second , if we take the definition of balnicity at face value , the breadth of its distribution is consistent with the anecdotal sense of the diversity of bal profiles derived from previous , smaller samples .",
    "third , the shallow slope of the distribution at the high - balnicity end suggests that the maximum velocity width of bals is probably as yet ill - defined .",
    "the mean quasar color is a strong function of redshift @xcite . to contrast the colors of bals and non - bal quasars most clearly , in figure  [ balcolors ] we show the distribution of colors after subtracting the mean color for our sample at each quasar s redshift . particularly in @xmath42 ,",
    "the distribution of bal colors is shifted distinctly to the red ( see also @xcite ) . in the mean ,",
    "the @xmath43 color difference is about 0.18  mag ; in @xmath44 it is about 0.34  mag . both color offsets are crudely constant with redshift for @xmath45 .",
    "this trend is in the same sense ( although somewhat smaller than ) the color contrast in the first survey @xcite , in which radio - selected bals were , on average , @xmath46  mag redder ( in a color roughly equivalent to @xmath47 ) than their radio - selected non - bal quasars .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this effect .",
    "it may be , for example , that there is dust associated with the absorbing material itself .",
    "it is also possible that the redder colors are due to dust , but farther from the nucleus along our line - of - sight ( e.g. , as proposed by @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", bal quasars may differ from ordinary quasars in some intrinsic fashion , perhaps having a different mean ratio of luminosity to eddington luminosity .",
    "alternatively , we may view them from a special angle .",
    "if the optical continuum is generated in an accretion disk , one might expect both that the continuum shape would depend on @xmath48 and that there is wavelength - dependent limb - darkening ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the latter effect would create a systematic color offset if the absorbing matter lies in a special direction relative to the disk .    that bal quasars are preferentially redder than ordinary quasars affects our ability to find them .",
    "the reason our bal fraction is larger than the fraction in the lbqs may be that quasars in the lbqs were selected in part on the basis of blue colors .",
    "if so , the comparative lack of color bias in the sdss may be critical for obtaining a fair estimate of the size and character of the bal population .",
    "in addition , if the redder colors are also associated with continuum flux that is weaker in the bal direction , the fraction of the sky around the nucleus covered by bal material would be larger than the population fraction of bals @xcite .",
    "we close with a brief comment about the radio properties of these bal quasars .",
    "@xcite found that none of their bals was radio - loud and therefore suggested an anti - correlation between the two properties . on the other hand , @xcite argued that , if anything , bal quasars were _ more _ likely to be found in radio - selected than in optically - selected samples .",
    "radio - loudness is often defined as @xmath49  ghz@xmath50  @xmath51  30 .",
    "this criterion can be applied to only about 4% of the sdss quasars because radio data are available for only those brighter at 1.4  ghz than the first flux limit . given the optical flux limit of the sdss quasar sample , essentially all those quasars in the edr detected by first are radio - loud by this criterion found by @xcite in the pg sample suggests that many radio - loud quasars in the sdss are a little too faint to have been detected by first .",
    "@xcite estimate a radio - loud fraction of @xmath52 ; relative to this fraction , there are still numerous radio - loud quasars in this sample that must fall just below the first detection limit . ] .",
    "five of the 116 bals found in our sample are radio - loud by this definition .",
    "our results are therefore consistent with the proposition that there is no difference between the radio - loud bal fraction and the radio - loud fraction among ordinary quasars .",
    "however , in view of the very small number of objects and the incompleteness of radio data for our sample , this conclusion must be tentative at best ."
