    "particle interferometry is a useful technique that provides information on the space - time properties of nuclear matter created in high energy collisions ( for the latest review articles see @xcite ) . in this paper results of particle correlations in p+p , d+au and cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 gev and au+au at @xmath1 and @xmath2 gev registered by the star experiment",
    "are presented .",
    "rich data statistics and the wide acceptance of the detectors gives an opportunity to do a multidimensional femtoscopic analysis .",
    "the main focus of this article is on the transverse mass ( @xmath3 ) dependence of the hbt radii for different system sizes .",
    "this allows the study of the dynamics of the source and the conditions of the collision .",
    "importantly , direct comparison between the @xmath0 dependence of radii from p+p and a+a collisions is possible for the first time .",
    "figure [ fig : universalscaling ] presents the hbt radii dependence on @xmath4 ( @xmath5 - number of charged particles ) for different colliding systems at different energies of the collisions . the motivation for studying such",
    "a relation is its connection to the final state geometry through the particle density at freeze - out .",
    "all star results , from p+p , d+au , cu+cu and au+au collisions , are combined on the left panel of this figure and , as seen , all radii exhibit a scaling with @xmath4 . on the right panel star radii , this time for different range of @xmath6 ,",
    "are plotted together with ags / sps / rhic systematics @xcite .",
    "it is impressive that the radius parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 follow the same curve for different collisions over a wide range of energies and , as it was checked , this observation is valid for all @xmath6 bins studied by star .",
    "it is a clear signature that the multiplicity is a scaling variable that drives these hbt radius parameters .",
    "@xmath9 mixes space and time information .",
    "therefore it is unclear whether to expect a simple scaling with the final state geometry .    despite the approximately linear dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath8 on @xmath10 , because of the finite intercepts of the linear relationships @xcite , the data do not imply freeze - out at a constant density .",
    "the fact that the radii scale at all ( linearly or not ) indicates that the sideward and longitudinal radius is determined only by multiplicity , independent of energy , colliding system , or impact parameter @xcite .",
    "this scaling , however , breaks down at much lower energies , when baryons constitute a significant fraction of the freeze - out system @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : systemexpansion ] suggests that the relationship between initial and final geometry is not trivial , however .",
    "there , the final rms of the source , estimated by @xmath7 at low @xmath6 @xcite , is plotted versus the initial rms of the overlap region , estimated with a glauber calculation .",
    "the system generated in central au+au collisions undergoes a two - fold expansion , while those from the most peripheral d+au and p+p collisions expand little .",
    "does this imply that small systems are less explosive than large ones ?",
    "this is explored in the next section .",
    "gev.,width=283 ]     gev.,width=302 ]    the @xmath0 dependence of the femtoscopic radii in heavy ion collisions is usually attributed to collective flow of a bulk system , and recent star results for central au+au collisions support this picture @xcite . in a flow scenario ,",
    "an approximately `` universal '' @xmath0 dependence should apply to all particle types .",
    "this is in fact observed in figure [ fig : rinv ] , in which one - dimensional radii from pion @xcite , charged kaon @xcite , neutral kaon @xcite , proton and anti - proton @xcite , and proton-@xmath11 @xcite correlations are plotted .",
    "correlations between particles with very different masses also show characteristic signals of collective flow @xcite .    decreasing @xmath0 dependences of the radii",
    "have previously been reported for hadron @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite collisions .",
    "until the star analysis , a direct comparison of the @xmath0 systematic from hadron collisions with those from a+a collisions had been hampered by the use of quite different parameterizations in the different experiments .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : ktscaling ] , the _ ratio _ of hbt radii from au+au collisions with those from p+p collisions are approximately independent of @xmath0",
    ". it might be that proposed explanations for the @xmath0 dependence in small systems , including heisenberg - type relations @xcite and inside - outside cascade scenarios @xcite , replicate the @xmath0 dependence from bulk collective flow .",
    "this would be a surprising and unfortunate coincidence , suggesting that dynamical signals in the space - time sector can not distinguish very different underlying physics .",
    "alternatively , as proposed by csrg _",
    "@xcite , it could be that p+p collisions generate a thermalized _ bulk system _ , similar to that created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "further theoretical work on this important question would be most welcome .",
    "however , as it is mentioned in the next section , further work is also required on the experimental side .",
    "hbt radii may arise from gaussian fits to the three - dimensional correlation function @xcite .",
    "but for low - multiplicity systems , unaccounted - for structures in the correlation function itself are observed . in particular",
    ", the value of the correlation function @xmath13 for large @xmath14 ( larger than the scale of quantum statistics or coulomb interactions ) does not approach a common @xmath15-independent value .",
    "thus , non - femtoscopic correlations ( e.g. due to momentum conservation ) are becoming significant here ; they have been also observed earlier , in elementary particle collisions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the spherical decomposition of the correlation function in @xmath15-space has been proposed @xcite as a sensitive measure of long - range non - femtoscopic correlations .",
    "the lowest-@xmath16 components @xmath17 of this procedure are shown in figure [ fig : sh ] .",
    "for all correlations of femtoscopic origin ( gaussian or not ) , @xmath18 must vanish @xcite for large @xmath15 ; clearly other correlations are present in star data .",
    "rt70 mm        while various possible sources of these correlations are still being explored , it is interesting to simply account for the long - range correlations by adding ad - hoc terms to the gaussian fits , which produce constant values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it was found that the ratios shown in figure 4 remain @xmath0-independent , though their values shift somewhat .",
    "the results of pion interferometry for all energies and colliding systems at rhic have been presented . in agreement with data at sps and ags",
    ", star indicates that the multiplicity is the scaling variable that determines the size of the source at freeze - out .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the @xmath0 dependence of hbt radii appears to be independent of collision species or multiplicity .",
    "finally , a problem with the baseline of the correlation function for low multiplicity collisions has been reported , and a promising tool based on the spherical harmonic decomposition of the correlation function has been used in order to address it .",
    "the physics of this structure remains under investigation .",
