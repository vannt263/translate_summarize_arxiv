    "we provide asymptotic lower bounds of probability of `` _ win _ '' ( _ i.e. _ , obtaining the last success ) for odds problem with multiple stoppings , which has some general setting in optimal stopping theory .",
    "the problem may be stated as follows .",
    "we observe sequentially a sequence of independent @xmath0 random variables , that is , bernoulli sequence , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a given positive integer and the distribution is @xmath3=p_i , \\ ; { \\mbox{\\rm pr}}[x_i=0]=1-p_i = q_i,\\ ; 0 < p_i < 1 $ ] for each  @xmath4 .",
    "we say `` _ success _ '' if @xmath5 and `` _ failure _ '' if @xmath6 .",
    "we want to stop on the last success with multiple stopping chances .",
    "this is an attractive problem setting .",
    "we may quote from bruss  @xcite : `` many stopping problems are of a similar kind .",
    "one often wants to stop on the very last success .",
    "for instance , investors are typically interested stopping on the last success in a given period , where a success is a price increase in a long position and a decrease in a short position .",
    "similarly , venture capital investors often try to put all reserved capital in the last technological innovation in the targeted field . in secretary problems , we want to select the best candidate ( which means stopping on the last record value ) and so on . ''    for single stopping problem , it has an elegant and simple optimal stopping strategy known as _ odds theorem _ or _",
    "sum the odds theorem_. for the odds problem , a typical lower bound for an asymptotic optimal value ( probability of win ) , when @xmath2 goes to infinity , is shown to be @xmath7 in bruss  @xcite .",
    "the value often appears in the literature of the many modifications of secretary problem having a specified probability of success , @xmath8 , [ see , e.g. , pfeifer  @xcite , samuels  @xcite for a review and others . ] , and",
    "in the one of the variations of prophet inequality based on relative ranks , [ see , e.g. , hill and krengel  @xcite and hill and kennedy  @xcite . ] .",
    "the value @xmath7 also appears in the asymptotic threshold value of the optimal stopping strategy for secretary problem . for large @xmath2 ,",
    "the optimal strategy is to pass the all candidate until @xmath9 and then stop at the first relative best ( if any ) thereafter .",
    "another variations of odds problem are studied by hsiau and yang  @xcite for markov - dependent trials with single stopping , ano , kakie  and miyoshi  @xcite for markov - dependent trials with multiple stoppings , tamaki  @xcite for stopping on any of the last m successes , and bruss and louchard  @xcite for unknown success probability .    for each multiple stopping odds problem , the questions arise ; ( a ) what is the optimal multiple stopping strategy to maximize the probability of win ?",
    "( b ) what is the maximum probability of win and the lower bound ? ( c ) what is the asymptotic lower bound of probability of win for any sequence @xmath10 of the success probability and for any fixed number of stopping chances , when @xmath2 goes to infinity ?",
    "( d ) is the lower bound for each fixed number of stopping chances attained by the corresponding one of the secretary problem with multiple stopping chances ?",
    "in other words , does secretary problem still keep benchmark position of the bound for odds problem ? ( f ) if so , is the lower bound , strange to say , composed of the asymptotic threshold values in the optimal multiple stopping strategy ?",
    "the first answer has been provided in ano , kakinuma and miyoshi  @xcite . when the decision maker has more @xmath11 stopping chances , there always exist threshold values satisfying inequalities @xmath12 , and for each @xmath13 the optimal stopping strategy",

    "( 2 ) for any sequence @xmath16 @xmath17 of the success probability satisfying some conditions and for any fixed number @xmath11 of stopping chances , we give the lower bound of probability of win for odds problem with @xmath11-stoppings .",
    "an efficient algorithm to calculate lower bounds is presented .",
    "( 3 ) we show that the asymptotic lower bound of probability of win for odds problem with @xmath11-stoppings is attained by the asymptotic maximum probability of win for secretary problem with @xmath11-stoppings .",
    "this answers the question ( c ) .",
    "so that , the answer for ( d ) is `` yes . '' ( 4 ) finally , we show a beautiful connection between threshold values of optimal stopping strategy and probability of win .",
    "the asymptotic lower bound is composed of the asymptotic threshold values , @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20= @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 , in the optimal multiple stopping strategy , and given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes a corresponding probability of win for odds problem ( and also for secretary problem ) with @xmath11-stoppings .",
