    "in the hot and dense system created in an ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision ( urhic ) , the relevant momentum scales for typical processes taking place inside the strongly interacting matter drop as a function of proper time @xmath2 : initially , the relevant scale is set by the incident beam momentum , leading to hard scattering processes which presumably can be described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "secondary inelastic scattering processes subsequently lower the momentum scales due to particle production . at later times , equilibration sets in and typical momenta @xmath3 are determined by the temperature t of a given volume element as @xmath4 .",
    "as the matter expands , energy stored in random motion of particles ( temperature ) is transferred to collective motion ( flow ) , leading to a descrease of @xmath5 with @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , by selecting an observable associated with a given momentum scale , one simultaneously selects a time period in the evolution of the system .    for this reason ,",
    "a measurement of hard real photons is an ideal tool to study the early moments of the fireball expansion : high momentum photons are not only sensitive to early proper times , but , being subject to electromagnetic interactions only , their mean free path in the fireball matter is also much larger than the spatial dimension of the system , therefore they are capable of leaving the emission region without significant rescattering .",
    "therefore , hard photons complement a measurement of low mass , low momentum dileptons which are dominantly emitted near the kinetic freeze - out point .    ideally , one would like to use hard photon emission as a thermometer to determine the initial temperature reached in an urhic and use this information to verify the creation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "however , in reality one has to disentangle thermal contributions to the photon spectrum from contributions coming from initial hard scattering processes .",
    "the interpretation of the photon spectrum alone can therefore not be unambiguous .    in this work ,",
    "we compare a model calculation of photon emission from a fireball created in an 158 agev pb - pb collision at sps with data obtained by the wa98 collaboration @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have developed a fireball model which is based on information from hadronic observables and lattice qcd thermodynamics , as manifest in a quasiparticle picture of the qgp .",
    "this model has been shown to successfully describe low mass dilepton emission @xcite and , within the framework of statistical hadronization , the measured abundancies of hadron species @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the same model is also capable of describing the observed photon emission .",
    "the fixed setup of the model also enables us to establish constraints on the equilibration time @xmath6 , which entered the model on an ad - hoc basis so far .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first , we introduce the photon emission rate used in the calculation and discuss its interpretation in the framework of the quasiparticle picture of the qgp which has been used in the fireball evolution model . in the next section ,",
    "we summarize the main properties of the evolution model and discuss constraints for the initial expansion phase .",
    "afterwards we present the resulting photon spectrum and demonstrate that , in agreement with our expectation , hard photons originate dominantly from the early evolution phase .",
    "we investigate the possibility of using the photon data to set limits on the equilibration time of the fireball matter and conclude by comparing to the results obtained by other groups .",
    "as we expect the dominant contribution to the spectrum of hard photons to come from a region of high temperatures , we focus on the qgp rate . to leading order",
    ", this rate can be calculated by evaluating the four diagrams shown in fig.[f - photon - feyn ] . here",
    "the last two diagrams are promoted to leading order because of near - collinear singularities .",
    "the complete calculation of the rate to order @xmath7 has been a very involved task which has been finished only recently @xcite . for the present calculation",
    ", we use the parametrization of the rate given in @xcite . there",
    ", the rate for photons of momentum @xmath8 is written as    @xmath9    with @xmath10 and @xmath11 the leading order large momentum limit of the thermal quark mass .",
    "the leading log coefficient @xmath12 reads @xmath13 here , the sum runs over active quark flavours and @xmath14 denotes the fractional quark charges in units of elementary charge .",
    "the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath15 dominates the momentum dependence of the rate : to a good approximation it decreases exponentially with @xmath16 .",
    "the dependence on the specific photon production process is contained in the term @xmath17 : @xmath18 all these functions @xmath19 involve non - trivial multidimensional integrals which can only be solved numerically . in @xcite , parametrizations for the results are given as @xmath20\\ ] ] and @xmath21      in @xcite , we have used a picture of massive , non - interacting quark and gluon quasiparticles to describe the qgp .",
    "close to the phase transition these quasiparticles are subject to confinement , parametrized by a universal function @xmath22 which reduces the number of thermodynamically active degrees of freedom as @xmath23 with @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 denotes the bose ( fermi ) distribution . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that this ansatz is capable of describing the lattice results for the qcd thermodynamics extremely well .    in the case of photon emission",
    ", we can not strictly retain this interpretation : the process @xmath26 is kinematically impossible and all other emission processes would be suppressed by @xmath27 for non - interacting quasiparticles . on the other hand , the fact that we want to study hard photons implies that at least one of the particles in the initial state is also hard .",
    "but such particles penetrate the screening cloud of thermal fluctuations which is ultimately responsible for the notion of weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "therefore it appears reasonable to allow for interactions of plasma particles with momenta well above the scale set by the temperature .",
    "the remaining properties of the quasiparticle approach are encoded in the quasiparticle mass @xmath28 and the confinement factor @xmath22 . in the limit of large temperatures , the quasiparticle mass in @xcite",
    "is chosen such as to coincide with the result of hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummed calculations for the thermal self - energy . therefore , inserting massive quarks as degrees of freedom into the above results would amount to double counting , since those already incorporate htl resummation , at least as long as we consider only temperatures above 1.5 @xmath29 .",
    "there is no equivalent of the confinement factor @xmath22 in the calculations described in @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the effect of introducing @xmath22 as follows :    a typical diagram , say @xmath30 annihilation , which contributes @xmath31 to the total emission rate has the structure @xmath32 , with the thermal quark distributions @xmath33 in front of the squared matrix element @xmath34 corresponding to the process in vacuum and a bose enhancement factor for the gluon emitted into the final state .",
    "the modification of the rate @xmath35 with respect to the rate @xmath31 in the presence of @xmath22 will read @xmath36 which is always larger than @xmath37 . in the case of quarks in the final state",
    ", @xmath22 leads even to a reduced pauli blocking ( the final state modification becomes @xmath38 which is larger in the presence of confinement ) .    on the other hand , as mentioned above , at least one of the incoming particles has to have a large momentum .",
    "such high - momentum particles are not subject to confinement along with the bulk of the matter .",
    "one would expect them to hadronize well outside the thermalized region , leading to @xmath39 at one of the incoming legs in the diagram .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 can be taken as a conservative estimate of the effect of the confinement factor on the emission rate . if it can be shown that hard photon emission is dominated by a region where the temperature is so large that @xmath41 , the above expression for the emission rate can be used to approximately describe photon emission from a system of quasiparticles also .",
    "this is also the region where we expect the mass of quasiparticles to be given by the htl result .",
    "we will verify this property a posteriori .    clearly , the prescription outlined here has to be regarded as an approximation till a more detailed version of a quasiparticle description of the qgp incorporating confinement is available .",
    "as the temperatures in the hadronic evolution phase of the fireball are lower than in the qgp phase , we expect the hadronic contributions to the emission of hard photons to be small",
    ". therefore , we will not discuss this contribution in great detail .",
    "vector mesons play an important role for the emission of photons from a hot hadronic gas .",
    "the first calculation of such processes has been performed in @xcite in the framework of an effective lagrangian .",
    "it has been found that the dominant processes are pion annihilation , @xmath42 , compton scattering , @xmath43 and @xmath44 decay , @xmath45 .",
    "several more refined approaches have been made since then ( for an overview , see @xcite ) . in the following",
    ", we will use a parametrization of the rate from a hot hadronic gas taken from @xcite which is given as @xmath46 \\simeq 4.8 t^{2.15 } \\exp[-1/(1.35 et)^{0.77 } ] \\exp[-e / t].\\ ] ]      in order to compare to the experimentally measured photon spectrum @xcite , we have to integrate eq .",
    "( [ e - photonrates ] ) over the space - time evolution of the fireball , @xmath47 in this expression , @xmath48 stands for the radial expansion of the fireball , @xmath49 denotes the rapidity interval covered by the detector , @xmath50 is the rapidity of a volume element at position @xmath51 and the limits of the @xmath52 integration come from the fact that a photon emitted at the ( boosted ) edge of the fireball has to have a longitudinal momentum in a certain range in order to be detected in the rapidity window of the experiment . in this expression",
    ", we have assumed spatial homogeneity and a cylindrical fireball .",
    "in this section , we briefly outline the general framework of the fireball evolution model .",
    "the model is described in greater detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption of the model is that the strongly interacting matter produced in the initial collision reaches thermal equilibrium at a timescale @xmath53 fm / c . for simplicity , we assume spatial homogeneity of all thermodynamic parameters throughout a 3-volume at a given proper time .",
    "the evolution dynamics is then modelled by calculating the thermodynamic response to a volume expansion that is consistent with measured hadronic momentum spectra at freeze - out .",
    "the volume itself is taken to be cylindrically symmetric around the beam ( z-)axis . in order to account for collective flow , we boost individual volume elements inside the fireball volume with velocities depending on their position . as flow velocities in longitudinal direction",
    "turn out to be close to the speed of light , we have to include the effects of time dilatation . on the other hand",
    ", we can neglect the additional time dilatation caused by transverse motion , since typically @xmath54 . the thermodynamically relevant volume is then given by the collection of volume elements corresponding to the same proper time @xmath2 . in order to characterize the volume expansion within the given framework , we need first of all the expansion velocity in longitudinal direction as it appears in the center of mass frame . for the position of the front of the cylinder",
    ", we make the ansatz @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a free parameter . the time @xmath57 starts running at @xmath58 such that @xmath59 is the initial longitudinal extension with @xmath60 the initial longitudinal expansion velocity .",
    "the longitudinal position @xmath61 and @xmath57 itself define a proper time curve @xmath62 . solving for @xmath63 one can construct @xmath64 .",
    "then the position of the fireball front @xmath61 in the center of mass frame can be translated into the longitudinal extension @xmath65 ) of the cylinder on the curve of constant proper time @xmath2 .",
    "one obtains @xmath66 at the same proper time we can define the transverse flow velocity and construct the transverse extension of the cylinder as a circle of radius @xmath67 where @xmath31 corresponds to the initial overlap radius , and @xmath68 is a free parameter . with the values of @xmath69 and @xmath35 obtained at a given proper time we can parametrize the 3-dimensional volume as @xmath70    in principle the model is fully constrained by fixing the freeze - out time @xmath71 ( at the fireball front ) , the proper time @xmath72 and the two constants @xmath68 and @xmath56 , such that the measured hadronic observables are reproduced . in practice",
    "this is achieved only at sps energy , where the freeze - out analysis @xcite allows a complete characterization on the basis of hadronic @xmath73 and @xmath74-spectra and hbt radii . for the 5% most central pb - pb collisions one requires @xmath75 while making a trial ansatz for the ratio @xmath76 .",
    "note that the proportionality of the acceleration to this ratio ( which is reminescent of the behaviour of the speed of sound ) allows a soft point in the eos to influence and delay the volume expansion .",
    "assuming entropy conservation during the expansion phase , we fix the entropy per baryon from the number of produced particles per unit rapidity . calculating the number of participant baryons as @xmath77+(t_a   \\leftrightarrow t_b)\\,,\\ ] ]",
    "we find the total entropy @xmath78 . the entropy density at a given proper time",
    "is then determined by @xmath79 . using the eos given by the quasiparticle approach @xcite , thereby providing the link with lattice",
    "qcd , we find @xmath80 and also @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which in the next iteration replace the trial ansatz in the volume parametrization",
    ". finally we arrive at a thermodynamically self - consistent model for the fireball which is by construction able to describe the hadronic momentum spectra at freeze - out .    in order to find the fireball evolution relevant for the photon emission measured for the 10% most central collisions , we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite . in brief",
    ", we consider an effective system which starts out with a reduced number of participants and hence reduced total entropy content .",
    "neglecting azimuthal asymmetries , we keep parametrizing the expanding system as a cylinder with reduced initial radius .",
    "assuming that the freeze - out temperature is approximately unchanged for more peripheral collisions , we determine a reduced proper evolution time and modify the geometrical freeze - out radius and the transverse flow velocity accordingly .",
    "however , going from the 5% to the 10% most central collisions , we find differences in the early evolution phases on the level of a few percent only .    thus , the fireball evolution is completely constrained by hadronic observables . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that this scenario is able to describe the measured spectrum of low mass dileptons , and in @xcite it has been demonstrated that under the assumption of statistical hadronization at the phase transition temperature @xmath29 , the measured multiplicities of hadron species can be reproduced .",
    "none of these quantities is , however , sensitive to the detailed choice of the equilibration time @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we have only considered the canonical choice @xmath83 1 fm / c so far .",
    "the calculation of photon emission within the present framework provides the opportunity to test this assumption and to limit the choice of @xmath6 .",
    "the result of the evaluation of eq.([e - photonintegratedrate ] ) with the fireball evolution model described in the previous section is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - photon - rates ] .",
    "the overall agreement with the data is remarkably good . above 2 gev",
    ", the calculation underestimates the data somewhat , leaving room for a contribution of prompt photons from initial hard processes of about the same magnitude as the thermal yield .",
    "note that the spectrum is almost completely saturated by the qgp contribution  for @xmath84 gev , the hadronic contribution is almost two orders of magnitude down .",
    "this can in essence be traced back to the strong temperature dependence of the emission rate normalization and justifies the approximate treatment of the hadronic contribution a posteriori .    in order to study the importance of the initial , high temperature phase in more detail",
    ", we present the time evolution of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ f - photon - taudep ] .",
    "one observes that the large @xmath85 region is almost exclusively dominated by the first fm / c of evolution proper time , whereas the yield in the low @xmath85 region is not yet saturated after 2 fm / c .",
    "however , the temperature associated with these evolution times is always larger than 250 mev , leading to @xmath86 @xcite and @xmath87 .",
    "this justifies neglecting the effect of quasiparticle properties on the rate a posteriori : there is a 30% uncertainty introduced into the calculation , but this is comparable with other intrinsic uncertainties , such as the detailed choice of the numerical value of @xmath88 in this temperature regime .",
    "the high @xmath85 tail of the spectrum is potentially capable of providing information about the initial temperature reached immediately after equilibration .",
    "this capability is seriously limited in practice , however , by the need to assess an unknown contribution of prompt photons , which may be large in this region . bearing this uncertainty in mind",
    ", we can nevertheless pursue this idea further in fig .",
    "[ f - photon - tau0 ] where we investigate the sensitivity of the result to the equilibration time @xmath6 of the fireball .",
    "we find that the low @xmath85 region of the spectrum is hardly affected by different choices for the equilibration time , while for larger @xmath85 one is increasingly sensitive to short evolution timescales .",
    "an equilibration time of 0.5 fm / c corresponding to an initial temperature of 370 mev leads to a good description of the data without the inclusion of any prompt photon contribution . on the other hand ,",
    "a rather slow equilibration corresponding to @xmath89 fm / c and an initial temperature of 260 mev requires a sizeable contribution from prompt photons .    without any reference to prompt photons , we are therefore able to fix @xmath90 fm / c as the lower bound for the equilibration time : shorter timescales would lead to thermal photon emission overshooting the data .",
    "if we want to find an upper limit for the equilibration time , we have to address the issue of prompt photon emission .",
    "for this purpose , we use the results of two different works @xcite to illustrate the possible range of predictions dependent on the average value of @xmath91 , an intrinsic transverse momentum scale which is introduced as a phenomenological parameter to account for non - perturbative effects .",
    "[ f - k_tdep ] ) .",
    "one observes that prompt photon production is able to explain the data above 3 gev for @xmath92 gev@xmath93 , but no choice of @xmath94 leads to a description of the data below 3 gev .",
    "thus , there is a momentum region between 2 and 2.5 gev where the data are only weakly affected by a prompt photon contribution .    on the other hand ,",
    "the present calculation of thermal photon emission indicates sensitivity to the equilibration time in this region ( see fig .",
    "[ f - photon - tau0 ] ) .",
    "one finds that an equilibration time of 2 fm / c is unable to describe the data even in the presence of a sizeable prompt photon contribution , hence we may regard this as the upper limit for the equilibration time given the results of @xcite .",
    "if we use alternatively the results of @xcite to estimate the contribution of prompt photons , the situation is somewhat less clear , though the main conclusions remain valid . in the momentum region near 2 gev , the result obtained for the prompt photon contribution in @xcite is about 50% of the thermal emission spectrum obtained with @xmath95 fm / c in the present calculation , which in turn is already on the lower end of the error bars of the data .",
    "therefore , the prompt photon contribution alone is unable to explain the spectrum in this momentum region , and a thermal contribution with @xmath96 fm / c is needed to describe the data near @xmath97 gev .",
    "( in @xcite , it is stated that the prompt photon contribution is of the same size as the thermal emission spectrum corresponding to a fireball with initial temperature of 300 mev , which is not true in the present calculation . however , this statement is derived using bjorken hydrodynamics , whereas the present model incorporates longitudinal acceleration of the fireball matter which leads to less cooling initially and hence to a prolonged qgp phase . )",
    "however , there are several uncertainties in the calculation .",
    "we have already discussed the complications introduced by the quasiparticle picture and the detailed choice of @xmath98 .",
    "an additional potential problem in the calculation is that the rate has been calculated to order @xmath98 , but @xmath98 is not a small quantity in the relevant temperatur region , so there might be sizeable higher order corrections . in view of these uncertainties and",
    "the less urgent need for an addition al contribution to prompt photons if the results of @xcite are taken , it is possibly better to estimate 0.5 fm / c @xmath99 3 fm / c for the equilibration time .    in principle",
    ", one might try to construct a scenario with a large equilibration time , using the most optimistic estimate for the prompt photon contribution .",
    "below temperatures @xmath100 mev , the approximations made to calculate the photon emission from the qgp phase break down , however qualitatively we expect the confinement factor @xmath22 to strongly reduce the emission rate .",
    "likely candidates for photon yield between 2 and 2.5 gev are therefore only the hadronic evolution phase and the pre - equilibrium phase .    in order for the hadronic phase to contribute significantly , either the emission rate or the four - volume of emitting matter needs to be increased significantly .",
    "the four - volume of fireball matter in the hadronic phase , however , is tightly constrained by the measured amount of dilepton radiation , which has been discussed in the present framework in @xcite .",
    "an increase of the emissivity of a hadronic gas , on the other hand , would very likely be accompanied by a change in the number of active degrees of freedom , which presumably are driven by in - medium mass reductions of resonances as argued in @xcite . a strong increase of active degrees of freedom , however , is not in agreement with a statistical hadronization analysis done in @xcite .",
    "even an overall mass reduction of 10% ( excluding the pseudoscalars ) is not compatible with the observed hadron ratios .",
    "therefore , within the present framework , the hadronic phase is not likely to give a large contribution to the photon spectrum .",
    "it remains the question of the yield from the pre - equilibrium phase .",
    "no rigorous scenario leading to thermal equilibrium for sps conditions has been developed so far , however , several aspects of the pre - equilibrium dynamics have already been investigated .    in @xcite ,",
    "the kinetic equilibration of different quark flavours was investigated under the assumption that gluons come to an early equilibrium and constitute a heat bath in which quark motion takes place .",
    "an early non - equilibrium distribution of quarks would of course directly influence the photon emission spectrum .",
    "somewhat related is the question of chemical equilibration of quarks . here ,",
    "the hot - glue scenario @xcite has been suggested where an initial undersaturation of the quark densities with respect to the thermal equilibrium densities is assumed , i.e. almost all of the entropy of the system is carried by the gluons , leading to a drastically increased initial temperature .",
    "the findings of @xcite suggest , albeit for rhic conditions , that the typical timescale for the kinetic equilibration of light quark flavours is of order @xmath101 fm / c .",
    "this timescale is roughly in line with the assumptions made in the present work .",
    "however , it leaves the question if the photon emission signal is affected if one starts with a suitable out - of - equilibrium initial quark distribution .    regarding the hot - glue scenario , note that the drastically increased temperature of the partonic matter would mostly affect the high momentum tail of observed photons and therefore leave the momentum region below 2.5 gev less affected .",
    "this is especially true since also the overall normalization of the emission rate is reduced with respect to equilibrium conditions due to the undersaturation of the quark densities .",
    "a different approach to pre - equilibrium dynamics has been taken in @xcite . here , transverse momentum dependence of dilepton emission has been calculated in a kinetic framework and calculations for different initital parton distributions have been tested .",
    "while the approach is very interesting , it is hard to directly estimate its possible influence on photon emission within the present framework .    in @xcite ,",
    "an investigation of non - equilibrium photon emission has been carried out using a parton - cascade model ( pcm ) . here",
    ", the essential findings were that only a very dilute partonic medium is created in the collision .",
    "photon emission from this medium was shown to explain the data above 3 gev when integrated up to the hadronization point , but below 3 gev , the photon spectrum from the partonic phase falls below the data .",
    "it is difficult to relate these findings directly to the present approach , since no equilibrium phase in either partonic or hadronic phase is described in the pcm .",
    "however , we may take this as an indication that pre - equilibrium dynamics is most likely to strongly affect the high momentum region of the photon spectrum only where we find considerable uncertainties with regard to the question of intrinsic @xmath91 anyway .    in the present work",
    ", no attempt has been made to calculate a contribution to the photon spectrum from pre - equilibrium matter .",
    "it is , however , unlikely that a long - lasting pre - equilibrium phase is characterized by a strong photon emission rate , since strong photon emission indicates frequent interaction processes in the medium which in turn would lead to fast equilibration .",
    "furthermore , it is plausible that a pre - equilibrium contribution mainly affects the ( uncertain ) high momentum region of the spectrum , as it is characterized by hard momentum scales .",
    "nevertheless , all results discussed in this paper are subject to some uncertainties resulting from the poor knowledge of pre - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "several other scenarios have been investigated by different authors in order to explain the photon spectrum measured by wa98 . in @xcite ,",
    "a hydrodynamical evolution model has been used .",
    "the favoured scenario found in this work uses a very short equilibration time of 0.2 fm / c , corresponding to an ( average ) initial temperature of 335 mev .",
    "the contribution of thermal photons is about 50% of the total yield , the rest is prompt photon contribution .    while the result for the equilibration time is clearly very different from the findings of the present work , several other results are similar , among them the weak sensitivity to the phase transition temperature @xmath29 ( indicating the dominance of early emission phases ) , the favoured large initial temperature and the dominance of the qgp over the hadronic signal . it remains to explain the remarkable difference in the conclusions about the equilibration time .",
    "note that both in @xcite and the present work large initial temperatures @xmath102 mev are needed to give a sizeable thermal photon emission in the momentum range in question .",
    "the choice of @xmath103 fm / c seems mainly driven by the need to create such large @xmath104 .",
    "there are , however , two important differences between our model and the one in @xcite which lead naturally to large initial temperatures for equilibration times above 0.5 fm / c in our approach .",
    "first , we employ an eos as based on lattice results , which leads to a temperature increase of about 30% for a given entropy density as compared to a bag model eos .",
    "second , the temperatures quoted in @xcite are obtained using the bjorken estimate @xcite .",
    "our fireball evolution , however , incorporates significant longitudinal acceleration of matter , which in essence leads to a peaked initial distribution of energy density at central rapidities and hence to significantly larger initial temperatures .    in @xcite ,",
    "a number of scenarios with different eos and initial state have been investigated within a hydrodynamical description .",
    "the reference scenario described there uses a bag model eos for the qgp phase with a transition temperature of 180 mev and an initial state which leads to a peak initial temperature of @xmath105 mev and an average initial temperature of @xmath106 255 mev .",
    "there is clearly a discrepancy between the average initial temperature in @xcite and the present work . due to the different space - time expansion patterns of the hot matter in the ( averaged ) present calculation and a hydrodynamics evolution ,",
    "this issue could possibly best be clarified by comparing the amount of four - volume corresponding to a given temperature instead of comparing the average at a given @xmath2 . at the moment however , this has to be regarded as an open question .",
    "in addition , there is a larger contribution to the photon spectrum of matter with temperatures below 200 mev observed in @xcite ( about 40% of the total yield)as compared to our model .",
    "this is presumably caused the different choice of the eos , which in the bag model case leads to faster cooling and to a long - lasting mixed phase , in essence reducing the weight of contributions from high temperatures and enhancing the low- temperature yield .",
    "a measurement of hard real photon emission provides a good opportunity to study the early evolution of a fireball . due to the temperature dependence of the photon emission rate",
    ", the qgp phase is expected to dominate over the contribution from the hadronic phase .",
    "we have used the leading order photon emission rate from the qgp , along with estimates of the impact of our phenomenological quasiparticle picture on this rate , in a simple model for the fireball evolution to calculate the resulting photon spectrum . as this model",
    "was fixed beforehand , we have not introduced any new free parameters .    for the standard choice of the equilibration time @xmath6",
    ", the model has been able to give a good description of the data .",

    ", we found for the equilibration time 0.5 fm / c @xmath99 3 fm / c .",
    "this would imply that a qgp phase must be present in the evolution , at least within the present model .",
