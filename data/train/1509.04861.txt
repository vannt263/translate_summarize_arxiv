    "in recent years , the research of the density dependent symmetry energy is still one of the hot topics in nuclear physics and astrophysics communities .",
    "this is simply because the symmetry energy governs many nuclear and astrophysical phenomena , such as the cooling of neutron stars @xcite , the mass - radius relations of neutron stars @xcite , the study of gravitational waves @xcite , properties of nuclei involved in r - process nucleosynthesis @xcite , and observables in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "while significant progress has been made in constraining the symmetry energy around saturation density @xcite , it is rather uncertain at supra - saturation densities .",
    "fortunately , more related experiments are currently underway or being planed at several advanced radioactive ion beam facilities such as csr / china @xcite , frib / usa @xcite , gsi / germany @xcite , riken / japan @xcite , or koria / korea @xcite .",
    "it thus provides more opportunities and enhances our confidences to study the symmetry energy although there are still many uncertain factors , such as the effects of pion potential @xcite , the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear strong interactions @xcite , the short - range tensor force @xcite and the @xmath5 dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the sensitivities of the @xmath1 ratio to the symmetry energy shown in ref .",
    "@xcite is quite different from that shown in ref .",
    "the discrepancies observed among the results of different models may be because the latter uses a momentum - dependent nucleon symmetry potential while the previous two studies use a momentum - independent nucleon symmetry potential .",
    "the momentum - dependent nucleon symmetry potential could increase the sensitivity of dense neutron to proton ratio ( thus the @xmath1 ratio ) to the symmetry energy @xcite . while in this study , we use a modified symmetry potential which including the effects of the short - range correlations of neutron and proton @xcite",
    ". the short - range correlations of neutron and proton reduce the kinetic symmetry energy , the strength of the modified symmetry potential is thus increased @xcite .",
    "the effects of such modified symmetry potential on the @xmath1 ratio may be also enlarged . in the following studies",
    ", we confirmed the above deduction .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it is argued that due to the difference of @xmath0 potential and nucleon potential , threshold conditions of pion and @xmath0 productions need to be modified .",
    "relating to the question of non - conservation of energy on @xmath0 or @xmath4 productions , in this study , we also investigate how the difference of @xmath0 and nucleon potentials affects pion production .",
    "if the effect of @xmath0 potential on @xmath1 ratio can be neglected , one can use nucleon potential to replace @xmath0 potential .",
    "our study shows that one can replace the @xmath0 potential by the nucleon isoscalar potential if a soft symmetry energy is employed .",
    "_ _     in this study , we use the semi - classical transport model ibuu , in which a momentum - independent and isospin - dependent mean - field potential is adopted @xcite .",
    "the symmetry potential reads @xmath6(\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0})^{\\gamma}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times[\\pm2\\frac{\\rho_n-\\rho_p}{\\rho}+(\\gamma-1)(\\frac{\\rho_n-\\rho_p}{\\rho})^2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 = 31.6 mev is the symmetry energy at saturation density , @xmath8 = -6.71 mev is the kinetic symmetry energy at saturation density , and @xmath9 denotes the degree of stiffness of the symmetry potential .",
    "the isoscalar potential for @xmath0 resonance has been studied by many people using various many - body approaches and interactions @xcite .",
    "considering that the mean field potential of @xmath0 resonance mainly depends on its interactions with surrounding nucleons , one can make an assumption that the isoscalar potential of @xmath0 resonance is the same as that for nucleon .",
    "the isovector potential for @xmath0 resonance can be an weighted average of that for neutrons and protons according to the charge state of @xmath0 resonance in the processes @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it reads @xmath11 for comparison , we also adopt the potential of @xmath0 resonance to be equal to the isoscalar potential of nucleon as the other choice , i.e. , @xmath12 by phenomenology @xmath0 potential has a depth of about -30 mev at @xmath13 while nucleon potential is approximately -50 mev deep @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can also use the form @xcite @xmath14 shown in fig .",
    "[ deltapot ] is our used density - dependent potentials of @xmath0 resonance with soft ( @xmath15 ) and stiff ( @xmath16 ) symmetry potentials , respectively .",
    "one can see that the density - dependent @xmath0 potential may also depend on the symmetry potential used .",

    "[ npt ] shows the effect of @xmath0 resonance potential on pre - equilibrium free @xmath3 ratio .",
    "it is seen that whether for soft or stiff symmetry potentials , the form of @xmath0 resonance potential does not affect pre - equilibrium free @xmath3 ratio at incident beam energies of 200 and 400 mev / a .",
    "only a small fraction of nucleons go through @xmath0 resonances in the whole reaction process , one thus does not see any effect of @xmath0 potential on pre - equilibrium free @xmath3 ratio @xcite .",
    "now we move to the study of pion production . shown in fig .",
    "[ e400piek ] is kinetic energy dependence of @xmath1 ratio with different forms of @xmath0 resonance potential and different symmetry potentials ( @xmath20 ) and with or without pion potentials @xcite in the central collision of @xmath2 at a beam energy of 400mev / a .",
    "[ e200piek ] is same as fig .",
    "[ e400piek ] , but for @xmath21 = 200 mev / a . unlike the pion potential used in ref .",
    "@xcite , our pion potential includes the isoscalar part and the isovector part and both of them are momentum dependent @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath1 ratio with @xmath0 resonance potential including isoscalar and iso - vector potentials is almost equal to that with only isoscalar @xmath0 resonance potential within error . around the coulomb peak @xcite",
    ", there are small differences with different @xmath0 resonance potentials , especially for different isoscalar potentials . because differences of @xmath0 resonance potentials with different charge states are in fact very small ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ deltapot ] ) , one sees negligible effect of @xmath0 isovector potential on the charged @xmath1 ratio .",
    "the general relative large discrepancy of the result corresponding @xmath22 potential is due to its larger difference from the other two as shown in fig .",
    "[ deltapot ] .",
    "the shallower potential well of @xmath22 potential causes @xmath0 resonance has shorter time to exist in nuclear matter , thus less affected by the coulomb potential .",
    "therefore , around the coulomb peak @xcite , the value of the @xmath1 ratio is not so large .",
    "it is also instructive to see if @xmath0 potential affects total charged pion production . shown in fig .",
    "[ g03-npi ] and fig .",
    "[ g15-npi ] are total charged pion productions at different incident beam energies with different @xmath0 potentials and nucleon symmetry potentials .",
    "again , one sees negligible effect of @xmath0 potential on the charged @xmath4 production .",
    "[ gamma03 ] and fig .",
    "[ gamma15 ] show the effect of @xmath0 resonance potential on @xmath1 ratio with soft and stiff symmetry potentials ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) at beam energies of 200 and 400mev / a , respectively .",
    "one sees negligible effect of @xmath0 potential on the charged @xmath4 production at higher incident beam energy @xmath21 = 400 mev / a whereas one may see observable effect ( about 5% ) of @xmath0 potential on the @xmath1 ratio at lower incident beam energy @xmath21 = 200 mev / a , especially for the stiff symmetry potential .",
    "the stiff symmetry potential causes larger difference among different charged ( i.e. , different isospin - dependent ) @xmath0 potentials .",
    "it is not surprise to see larger value of @xmath1 ratio with the isovector @xmath0 potential .",
    "since @xmath0 resonance lies in different reaction periods , it is thus interesting to see in which reaction period the @xmath0 potential shows sensitivity to the @xmath1 ratio . in order to know in which reaction period",
    "the @xmath1 ratio shows sensitivity to the @xmath0 potential , similar with previous studies @xcite , in the whole reaction process @xmath23 fm / c we use @xmath24 as the standard calculation , which gives a value of @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 to see the relative sensitivity in different reaction periods ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) , we turn on the @xmath0 potential ( e.g , @xmath28 ) in one reaction period but keep it null in the residual reaction period .",
    "we thus get the other value of the @xmath1 ratio @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 by comparing these new computational results with the standard calculation @xmath25 , one can obtain the relative sensitivity in a certain reaction period , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ piratio ] is the decomposition of the sensitivity of the @xmath0 resonance potential to the @xmath1 ratio in different reaction periods .",
    "it is seen that the effect of @xmath0 resonance potential on the @xmath1 ratio in different reaction periods are not more than 2% , thus the total effect of @xmath0 resonance potential on the @xmath1 ratio is roughly 5% . as expected , the maximal effect of @xmath0 resonance potential on the @xmath1 ratio is in the maximal compression period of the @xmath2 reaction .",
    "in summary , in the framework of the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck(ibuu ) transport model , we studied the effects of @xmath0 resonance potential on the free n / p and @xmath1 ratios in @xmath2 reaction at beam energies of 200 and 400 mev / a .",
    "it is shown that the effect of @xmath0 potential on the ratio of pre - equilibrium free @xmath3 is negligible .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 potential on the ratio of @xmath1 may be observable only at lower incident beam energies . relating to the question of non - conservation of energy on @xmath0 or @xmath4 productions in heavy - ion collisions , one can replace @xmath0 potential by nucleon isoscalar potential especially a soft symmetry energy is employed .",
