    "the statics and dynamics of liquid droplets in wedge geometries is an active research topic across disciplines , spanning biological physics  @xcite , granular media  @xcite and microfluidics  @xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , understanding the motion of droplets in wedges can shed light on complex phenomena , such as interfacial instabilities  @xcite and the impact of surface roughness on contact - line dynamics  @xcite .",
    "when a liquid droplet is brought into contact with the inner walls of a wedge - shaped channel , the system will tend to minimise its total surface energy .",
    "in general , the transient dynamics and the final equilibrium state can be characterised in terms of two main parameters , corresponding to the opening angle of the wedge , @xmath1 , which characterises the confinement geometry , and the equilibrium contact angle of the liquid with the solid , @xmath0 , which quantifies the wetting properties of the liquid .    broadly speaking",
    ", one can identify three qualitatively different regimes for the behaviour of droplets in wedges depending on the interplay between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the first corresponds to an ` apex contact ' regime , where @xmath3 . in such cases",
    "the liquid - gas interface is concave and forms a transient _ capillary bridge _ when placed between the walls of a wedge .",
    "it was first noted by @xcite that the free motion of such structures ( i.e. , in the absence of external forces , such as gravity ) always results in their migration towards the apex of the wedge . for situations where @xmath4 , @xcite , and @xcite showed that a global equilibrium is not possible , leading to the complete spreading of the liquid along the wedge apex . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath5 , the liquid - gas interface forms an equilibrium shape that touches the apex of the wedge keeping a contact line of finite length , sometimes referred to as an ` edge - blob '  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the motion of completely - wetting capillary bridges within wedge - shaped channels and identified two regimes in the dynamics of the liquid .",
    "close to the apex , the main source of energy dissipation is the viscous friction in the bulk of the liquid , which balances the rate of work done by capillary forces . as a result , the time evolution of the position of the capillary bridge is linear .",
    "this picture changes when the liquid is far from the apex of the wedge , where the main source of dissipation is the corner flow near the apparent contact lines .",
    "the result is a different equation of motion , which is given by a power - law dependence of the position of the liquid as a function of time with an exponent @xmath6 .",
    "a second regime corresponds to the reverse limiting wetting situation , where @xmath7 , and for which a liquid in a wedge - shaped channel will form a suspended droplet , a situation also found for gas bubbles .",
    "in such a case , a confined droplet will always migrate away from the apex of the wedge  @xcite .",
    "in sharp contrast to the complete - wetting limit , the equilibrium shapes of suspended droplets or bubbles correspond to perfect spheres .",
    "the dynamics of such systems will often involve the interplay between the liquid / gas and the surrounding fluid  @xcite .",
    "however , in the specific case of a low - viscosity fluid ( air ) suspended in a liquid of relatively high viscosity ( silicone oil ) , @xcite showed that the main sources of dissipation originate from the liquid , and that the same equations of motion that hold for completely wetting capillary bridges also hold for completely nonwetting bubbles .    the third regime , which is the focus of this paper , corresponds to a mostly non - wetting situation , where @xmath8 . in such a case ,",
    "the liquid - gas interface is convex , i.e. , it has a positive mean curvature .",
    "therefore , upon contact with the walls of a wedge , a droplet will form a _",
    "liquid barrel_. @xcite studied the equilibria of liquid barrels in wedge geometries .",
    "they showed that , in contrast to capillary bridges , liquid barrels form closed surfaces avoiding the apex of the wedge , and that , in the absence of external forces , such shapes correspond to sections of spheres .",
    "experimentally , @xcite recently observed such equilibrium shapes using an electrowetting setup , and showed that a spherical equilibrium shape implies a vanishing net force acting on the liquid and that non - spherical static shapes appear when subjecting the liquid to the action of gravity .",
    "whilst the equilibrium states of liquid barrels in a wedge geometry are now well understood , several questions regarding the statics and dynamics of these systems remain open .",
    "in particular , the statics and dynamics of non - spherical barrel shapes can only be understood by knowledge of the net restitutive capillary force ( which can be inferred from the free - energy landscape ) , and of any resistive forces , such as a net external force or a friction force caused by the motion of the liquid .",
    "importantly , understanding the motion of liquid barrels towards an equilibrium state can reveal details of dissipative processes at three different length scales , namely , the large - scale viscous friction caused by the bulk flow pattern , the viscous friction caused by the motion of the liquid near the contact line , often described as a corner flow , and the friction caused by the motion of the contact line itself .    in the present article ,",
    "we carry out a theoretical study of the statics and dynamics of a liquid drop that forms a barrel shape upon contact with the walls of a wedge - shaped channel . in  [ section : governing equations ] we introduce a near - equilibrium model for the morphology of the barrel and compute the corresponding free - energy landscapes as a function of the position of the barrel relative to the apex of the wedge .",
    "we compare our analytical results in the near - equilibrium limit to numerical computations of the surface energy using a minimisation algorithm that fixes a constraint in the centre of mass of the liquid . in ",
    "[ section : motion of the droplet near equilibrium ] we derive the equations of motion of the liquid barrel using a lagrangian approach , and calculate the overall drag arising from the bulk , corner - flow and contact - line contributions to energy dissipation . finally , in  [ section : discussion and conclusions ] we discuss the implications of our results .",

    "we focus on a situation where the mass , @xmath21 , temperature , @xmath22 , and volume of the liquid , @xmath23 , are held constant .",
    "the relevant thermodynamic potential is the helmholtz free energy @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the internal energy and entropy , respectively .    from the second law of thermodynamics , the helmholtz free energy will either remain constant or decrease upon a change in the configuration of the system , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "such changes in the free energy are caused by the interfacial variations @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the liquid - gas , solid - liquid , and solid - gas surface tensions respectively ; and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the corresponding interfacial areas .",
    "therefore , equilibrium states correspond to minima of the surface energy @xmath35 where the equilibrium angle , @xmath36 , is determined by young s law , @xmath37      to determine @xmath38 , we need to specify a suitable parametrisation of the geometry of the droplet , as shown in figure  [ fig : diagram_droplet_geometry ] . in cartesian",
    "coordinates , the wedge walls are oriented at an angle @xmath1 from the @xmath39 plane and intersect along the @xmath40 axis .",
    "the unit normals to the walls are @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that the wedge walls are identical and perfectly uniform , implying a reflection symmetry about the bisector plane .",
    "we describe a point on the liquid - gas interface using the position vector @xmath43 the vector @xmath44 defines the position of the geometric centre of the droplet , @xmath45 , relative to the apex of the wedge .",
    "the vector @xmath46 is coplanar to the bisector plane , i.e. , @xmath47 , where @xmath14 is an azimuthal angle .",
    "the vector @xmath48 points in the direction of the unit vector @xmath49 , where the polar angle @xmath15 subtends between the top and bottom walls .",
    "the combination of @xmath50 and @xmath51 can therefore be used to specify the shape of the liquid - gas interface .    whilst the azimuthal angle varies in the interval @xmath52 , the polar angle is restricted by the intersection of the liquid - gas interface with the solid walls , i.e. , @xmath53 $ ] , where the maximum angle , @xmath54 , can be found by the geometrical condition @xmath55 in addition ,",
    "one can write a relation for the contact angle of the liquid - gas interface with the solid , @xmath17 , measured from the liquid phase , which reads @xmath56    the aspect ratio of the droplet can be characterised by the height - to - width ratio , @xmath57 where the droplet height , @xmath58 is the length of the line connecting the contact lines at the narrow end of the wedge and the droplet width , @xmath59 , is the distance between the leading and trailing points of the droplet s equator .    using the parametrisation @xmath60 , we define the surface elements of the liquid - gas and solid - liquid interfaces as @xmath61 therefore , the surface energy @xmath38 , and the volume of the droplet , @xmath23 , can be expressed as @xmath62 and @xmath63 where we have made use of the divergence theorem in the last equality .      for a liquid droplet of typical density @xmath64 , dynamic viscosity @xmath65 , surface tension @xmath66 and characteristic linear size @xmath67",
    ", the typical translation speed inside a narrow wedge , @xmath68 , is @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , the reynolds number @xmath70 , the capillary number , @xmath71 , and the weber number , @xmath72    the smallness of the weber and reynolds numbers implies that perturbations to the liquid - gas interface of the droplet decay over a short timescale relative to the timescale of translational motion the drop  @xcite , which we will describe by focusing on the regime of lubrication flow  @xcite by restricting our discussion to the limit of small wedge angles ( @xmath73 ) . here",
    ", the smallness of the capillary number indicates that capillary forces dominate over the viscous bending of the interface , including the region near the contact lines  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we describe the near - equilibrium shape of the droplet as a smooth barrel shape intersecting the solid at the equilibrium contact angle . in terms of the parametrisation introduced in  [ subsection : geometry ] , this corresponds to introducing the following approximations : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the local radii of curvature in the normal and tangent directions to the bisector plane , respectively . in terms of  ( [ eq : shapetheta])([eq : shapew ] )",

    "@xcite showed that for such solutions the surface tension acting on the wall integrated over the contact line exactly matches the pressure exerted by the liquid integrated over the solid - liquid interface .    in terms of ( [ eq : shapetheta])([eq : shapew ] ) ,",
    "such force - free spherical shapes can be recovered by setting @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath79^{1/3}. \\label{eq : equilibrium-1-r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this yields the following relations for the equilibrium position , @xmath80 , height - to - width ratio , @xmath81 , and surface energy , @xmath82 : @xmath83    figure  [ fig : equilibria ] shows the equilibrium surface energy of liquid barrels at different positions within the wedge .",
    "we first focus on the effect of @xmath0 on @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for @xmath86",
    ", a suspended droplet will always reduce the total surface energy by wetting the walls of the wedge .",
    "this wetted area is be larger for smaller @xmath0 , and , because of volume conservation , the liquid settles at an equilibrium position closer to the wedge apex ( see insets in figure  [ fig : equilibria ] ) . at first sight",
    ", one might expect a similar effect by increasing the wedge angle , @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , from  ( [ eq : equilibrium-1-x ] ) an increase in the wedge angle leads to a closer position of the barrel to the wedge apex .",
    "the surface energy , however , remains constant .",
    "geometrically , this can be understood by noting that a change in @xmath1 is equivalent to a rotation of the solid walls about the centre of the sphere , which does not alter the size of any of the interfaces of the barrel , as shown in the insets of figure  [ fig : equilibria ] .",
    "( colour online ) equilibrium surface energy , @xmath84 , as a function of the distance from the wedge apex , @xmath85 , for different equilibrium contact angles ( full symbols ) and wedge angles ( empty symbols ) .",
    "the insets correspond to cross sections of the barrels along the @xmath18 plane.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    note that for the droplet to form a closed barrel , that is , a structure that bridges the walls of the wedge avoiding its apex , one must have @xmath87 , or , equivalently , @xmath88 from  ( [ eq : equilibrium-1-h ] ) , this condition is satisfied only if @xmath89    equilibrium states can also exist if @xmath90 but not as liquid barrel shapes . in such cases it has been shown that the liquid completely invades the wedge  @xcite and forms edge blobs  @xcite or filaments that spread laterally along the wedge apex  @xcite .",
    "for a parallel - plate geometry ( @xmath91 ) , force - free barrels can exist provided that the separation between the solid walls matches the equilibrium height @xmath92 which follows easily from  ( [ eq : equilibrium-1-h ] ) . as noted by  @xcite",
    ", a displacement of the solid wall from this equilibrium configuration will still result in mechanical equilibrium , albeit in the presence of a net external force .",
    "this situation can also occur for capillary bridges ( @xmath93 ) , for which no force - free equilibrium configurations can exist and the net force exerted by the liquid on the solid plates is always attractive .      out of equilibrium , the shape of the liquid barrel can be determined from ( [ eq : xlg])([eq : gentheta ] ) , subject to ( [ eq : shapetheta])([eq : shapew ] ) . however , under these assumptions the unit vector @xmath94 is approximately normal to the contact line . therefore , the boundary condition  ( [ eq : gentheta ] ) can be replaced by the constraint @xmath95 combining these equations determines the transverse radius of curvature , @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 here , @xmath99 is a rescaled position of the geometric centre of the barrel , which reduces to the barrel s radius in equilibrium , i.e. , @xmath100 .",
    "the parameter @xmath101 , on the other hand , quantifies displacements of the equatorial radius of curvature from the spherical configuration .    for a given volume , choosing the position of the barrel fixes its equatorial width , and consequently , @xmath99 and @xmath101 are not independent .",
    "rather , evaluating ( [ eq : vgencart ] ) gives the relation @xmath102 where the constants @xmath103 are functions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and are reported in appendix a. their expressions , however , simplify considerably in the limit of small wedge angles .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 using this approximation , and inverting ( [ eq : vpoly ] ) , we find @xmath105    in order to evaluate the free energy ( [ eq : freeenergygeneral ] ) , we first express @xmath38 as a polynomial expansion in @xmath101 .",
    "after some manipulations , we obtain @xmath106 the constant - volume energy landscapes , @xmath107 , are then obtained by inserting ( [ eq : epspath ] ) into ( [ eq : epoly ] ) and recovering the definition of @xmath99 from ( [ eq : defofq ] ) , i.e. , @xmath108 figure  [ fig : freeenergylandscape](a ) shows the energy landscapes for several values of @xmath0 but keeping @xmath109 .",
    "the asymmetry in the landscapes about the equilibrium position arises from the intrinsic asymmetry of the geometry of the wedge .",

    "this corresponds to setting @xmath208 in ( [ eq : hnoneq ] ) , which leads to a decrease in the aspect ratio , i.e. , @xmath209 .",
    "in contrast , a displacement towards the wide end of the wedge causes a vertical extension of the interface , and corresponds to @xmath210 , or , equivalently , @xmath211 .",
    "the energy landscapes reported in   [ subsection : near equilibrium ] suggest that the spherical barrel shapes correspond to global minima in the surface energy , and therefore distortions to such shapes will always relax back to equilibrium . for situations",
    "where @xmath36 and @xmath1 are kept constant , trajectories towards equilibrium run as vertical lines in figure  [ fig : h_plot ] , pointing towards the master curve @xmath212 .",
    "@xcite showed that the equilibrium barrel shapes are subject to a vanishing net force .",
    "in such a case , the pressure force exerted by the walls on the droplet is exactly balanced by the surface tension acting along the contact line . out of equilibrium ,",
    "the net force will not vanish . because the mean curvature of the barrels is positive",
    ", the average laplace pressure within the droplet is larger than the pressure of the surrounding medium . therefore , the lateral projection of the pressure force exerted by the liquid on the walls of the wedge points towards the apex , and , consequently",
    ", the walls will always exert a reaction force pointing in the outwards direction . on the other hand",
    ", the tension acting over the contact line can always be locally decomposed into components that are normal and tangential to the solid surface . in situations where the contact angle is uniform , the integral of the tangential component of the tension force over the contact line will vanish .",
    "the vertical component will always point towards the solid , and therefore , the walls will exert a net force pointing inwards . because a displacement of the barrel towards the narrow end of the wedge always results in an outwards motion , one can infer that the pressure force must be larger than the tension force . on the other hand , the inwards motion of the barrels from the wide end of the wedge towards their equilibrium position suggests that the dynamics is dominated by the tension acting at the contact line .",
    "these features are analogous to the well - known problem of capillary invasion  @xcite . for tension - dominated dynamics",
    "one expects little deviation of the local contact angle from the equilibrium contact angle , similarly to the spontaneous imbibition problem , whilst in the pressure - dominated regime the interface should deform more appreciably from its equilibrium configuration , as in forced imbibition .",

    "is superimposed on the right - hand side axis .",
    "the vertical lines in both plots correspond to the limiting wetting angle @xmath215 ]    we close our discussion by focusing on the relaxation time scale of the translational motion of the barrels , @xmath216 , which results from the balance of the driving capillary force , characterised by the restitution constant @xmath214 , and the overall friction , characterised by the drag coefficient , @xmath160 .",
    "figures  [ fig : relaxation_time](a ) and ( b ) show plots of @xmath214 , @xmath160 , and @xmath213 as functions of the equilibrium angle . in the limit @xmath217 , the barrel equilibrium position is closer to the apex of the wedge .",
    "geometrically , this implies a stronger confinement , and thus both the bulk contribution to the friction coefficient and the restitution constant reach local maxima in this limit . for larger @xmath0 ,",
    "both quantities decrease monotonically , leading to an initial decrease in the relaxation time . however , the rate at which @xmath214 decreases becomes dominant with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this is because at higher equilibrium contact angle the barrels keep an approximately spherical shape for larger displacements from equilibrium . as a result ,",
    "the relaxation time reaches a minimum , beyond which it increases with @xmath0 until it reaches a maximum saturation value as @xmath218 .",
    "interestingly , the location of the minimum and maximum relaxation times shown in figure  [ fig : relaxation_time](b ) depends on the contributions to dissipation from the motion of the corner flow and the contact line .",
    "the typical magnitude of the corner flow is controlled by the length scale separation between the macroscopic length scale @xmath219 , and the microscopic length scale @xmath186 that characterises the molecular processes at the level of the contact line  @xcite . for a macroscopic droplet , @xmath220 and @xmath221 , and thus @xmath222 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : relaxation_time](a ) , this additional contribution is important at intermediate angles , and vanishes in the limit @xmath223 .",
    "this is the combined effect of a vanishing contour length and a less confined corner flow at higher opening angle . as a result of the corner flow , the minimum in the relaxation time",
    "is displaced to a higher contact angle , as shown in figure  [ fig : relaxation_time](b ) .",
    "the contribution of contact line dissipation to the drag coefficient is controlled by the ( constant ) microscopic friction coefficient @xmath189 and the contour length of the contact line .",
    "therefore , this term decays more slowly than the corner flow term in  ( [ eq : netdragcoefficient ] ) .",
    "the relative weight of these sources of dissipation , however , is controlled by the ratio @xmath224 . estimating @xmath189 will in general be subject to the details of a specific model  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . rather",
    ", here we examine the case where @xmath225 in  ( [ eq : netdragcoefficient ] ) as a specific example where the corner and contact line dissipation are comparable in magnitude . as shown in figures  [ fig : relaxation_time](a ) and  [ fig : relaxation_time](b ) , the main effect of this term is a slower decay in the contact line dissipation with increasing contact angle , which in turn leads to an overall broadening of the maximum in the relaxation time .",
    "therefore , the qualitative shape for @xmath213 _ vs _ @xmath0 can be used in experiments to identify the relative contribution of each source of dissipation in the motion of the liquid barrels .",
    "more quantitatively , our model can be used to estimate the values of the microscopic cut - off length , @xmath182 , and the friction coefficient , @xmath189 , by treating these quantities as fitting parameters .",
