    "krawtchouk polynomials are the simplest finite - discrete polynomials of the askey scheme of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "they play an essential role in the study of problems coming from different branches of modern science .",
    "image analysis based on their moments  @xcite , exactly solvable birth and death processes  @xcite , perfect qubit transfer in a spin chain with nearest - neighbour interaction  @xcite are only a few of such problems solved by employing krawtchouk polynomials .",
    "also in the `` discretisation '' of the quantum - mechanical formulation of the harmonic oscillator problem they play an important role . the non - relativistic explicit formulation of this problem in the infinite continuous configuration space is well known within the canonical approach .",
    "the wavefunctions of stationary states are expressed in terms of the hermite polynomials both in momentum and position representation  @xcite . under the assumption that the quantum world is quite different from the classical one , various approaches and methods",
    "allow to construct a number of exactly solvable mathematical models of the quantum harmonic oscillator , where the wavefunctions are expressed in terms of other known orthogonal polynomials .",
    "also the krawtchouk polynomials allow one to construct a number of interesting quantum harmonic oscillator models in finite - discrete configuration space . at present , the known models using krawtchouk polynomials are the @xmath1 model  @xcite and the @xmath6 model  @xcite for the finite quantum harmonic oscillator . in the case of @xmath1 dynamical symmetry , the wavefunctions of the model are defined through the special case of krawtchouk polynomials with a fixed parameter @xmath2 . for the ` supersymmetric ' model with @xmath6 dynamical symmetry , the wavefunctions are expressed by means of general krawtchouk polynomials with parameter @xmath7 . in the present work , we present a new oscillator model with wavefunctions of even and odd states also expressed by krawtchouk polynomials with fixed @xmath2 , but in a very different way : the polynomials that appear are @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the dynamical symmetry is formally called a @xmath0 deformation of the @xmath1 lie algebra .",
    "the current paper is structured as follows ; in section  2 , the @xmath0 deformation of the @xmath1 lie algebra and its representations are introduced . then",
    ", this algebra is used for the construction of a model of the finite - discrete quantum harmonic oscillator . in section  4",
    ", we discuss explicit expression of the wavefunctions of the constructed model both in momentum and position representations .",
    "finally , section  5 covers a brief summary and discussion of the obtained results .",
    "our starting point is the definition of the formal algebra @xmath1 under the @xmath0 deformed symmetry by its basis elements @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the algebra @xmath5 is a unital algebra with basis elements @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 subject to the following relations :    * the operator @xmath11 commutes with all basis elements .",
    "* @xmath12 is a parity operator satisfying @xmath13 and @xmath14=\\p j_0-j_0\\p=0 , \\qquad \\{\\p , j_\\pm\\}=\\p j_\\pm + j_\\pm \\p= 0 . \\label{p}\\ ] ] * the @xmath1 commutation relations are @xmath0 deformed as follows : @xmath15 = \\pm j_\\pm ,   \\label{j0j+ } \\\\ & [ j_+ , j_- ] = 2j_0 \\left ( { \\c\\p-1 } \\right ) .",
    "\\label{j+j-}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the next step is to describe representations of this algebra , by defining the actions of the basis elements @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in such a way that they are compatible with the commutation relations and .",
    "it is easy to verify that an action exists on the usual standard basis vectors @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 being an integer and @xmath18 ) , which is reminiscent of but different from the common @xmath1 algebra action .",
    "this is given by : @xmath19 note that @xmath17 must be integer ( and not half - integer ) in order to be a representation ( one way to see it is that one should still have @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "the algebra representation is completed by the action of the extra operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 : @xmath22    despite the fact that this algebra is at first sight very close to @xmath1 , its behaviour is quite different .",
    "for example , the representations matrices of @xmath23 in the @xmath5 algebra never coincide with the representation matrices of these elements in the @xmath1 algebra , except for the trivial representation @xmath24 .",
    "note also that there is no `` deformation parameter '' that takes the @xmath5 algebra to the @xmath1 algebra for some limit .",
    "we now consider an oscillator model based on the algebra introduced , and choose the hamiltonian , position and momentum operators in a way that is similar to the non - deformed @xmath1 one - dimensional oscillator case  @xcite , i.e. @xmath25 one can easily check that these three operators satisfy the heisenberg equations : @xmath26 =   - \\mi\\hat p,\\quad \\left [ { \\hat h,\\hat p } \\right ] = \\mi\\hat q.\\ ] ] then , one can also observe that @xmath27 so the spectrum of @xmath28 is equidistant but finite : @xmath29 from the actions   and   one obtains for the position operator @xmath30 that @xmath31 when @xmath32 is even , and @xmath33 when @xmath34 is odd .",
    "one can do the same computations for the operator @xmath35 . in matrix form ,",
    "both position and momentum operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 take the following form : @xmath38 and @xmath39 with matrix elements @xmath40    the purpose is now to study the eigenvalues of the position ( and momentum ) operator in this model . in other words : we need to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it turns out that these eigenvectors can be constructed in terms of symmetric krawtchouk polynomials . in general ,",
    "krawtchouk polynomials @xmath43 of degree @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) in the variable @xmath46 , with parameter @xmath7 , are defined in terms of the @xmath47 hypergeometric function of argument @xmath48 as follows  @xcite : @xmath49 their orthogonality holds for discrete values of @xmath46 , and is given by : @xmath50 where , @xmath51 here , @xmath52 are pochhammer symbols .",
    "we can introduce the following orthonormal krawtchouk functions : @xmath53 let us also mention that for @xmath2 , the corresponding krawtchouk polynomials are called `` symmetric '' , since @xmath54    in previous examples , the construction of a quantum oscillator model in term of orthogonal polynomials is based on the differential ( or difference ) equation , the solution of which is expressed in terms of that polynomial . in this sense , the @xmath1 one - dimensional krawtchouk oscillator model  @xcite is based on the difference equation for krawtchouk polynomials  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 9.11.5 ) ) , whereas the @xmath6 one - dimensional krawtchouk oscillator model  @xcite is based on the forward and backward shift operator equations for them  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 9.11.6 ) , ( 9.11.8 ) ) . for our current construction ,",
    "the essential point here is a set of new difference equations for symmetric krawtchouk polynomials ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "these new relations involve a pair of symmetric krawtchouk polynomials shifted in variables @xmath56 or @xmath57 and parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the symmetric krawtchouk polynomials satisfy the following difference equations : @xmath60 in these equations , the integer @xmath44 is arbitrary but should be taken appropriately ( e.g.  for the first krawtchouk polynomial , the degree @xmath61 should belong to @xmath62 )",
    ".    * proof . *",
    "the validity of both equations is related to a higher level hypergeometric series than @xmath63 , namely @xmath64 . for this purpose",
    ", we can use the following relation  ( * ? ? ? * ( 39 ) ) : @xmath65 using this equation for the @xmath63 expressions in   leads to the following identity to verify : @xmath66 now , to prove the correctness of   it is sufficient to simplify the pochhammer symbols in the expansion of the @xmath64 s in the right hand side , collect terms , and the left hand side appears automatically .",
    "the proof of   is similar . in this case , using   leads to the following identity : @xmath67 the verification of this again depends on elementary manipulations of pochhammer symbols .",
    "now , our aim is to construct eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath41  .",
    "this is rather technical , but is essentially based on   and  . for this purpose , we construct the matrix @xmath68 in the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath69 be the tridiagonal @xmath70-matrix   and let @xmath71 be the @xmath70-matrix with matrix elements as follows .",
    "for an even row index @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) , let @xmath74 for an odd row index @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) , let @xmath77 then @xmath68 is an orthogonal matrix : @xmath78 furthermore , the columns of @xmath68 are the eigenvectors of @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues @xmath81 of @xmath41 : @xmath82 [ propu ]    * proof . *",
    "the proof of this proposition is quite similar to  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  3 ) . the matrix relations   follow directly from the two difference equations   and .",
    "the orthogonality of the matrix @xmath68 is slightly tricky , and does not follow ( as one would expect ) directly from the orthogonality of symmetric krawtchouk polynomials . instead , just as in the proof of proposition  2",
    "we need to go to higher level hypergeometric series . reexpressing the @xmath63 s in terms of @xmath64 s by means of",
    ", the corresponding @xmath64 s can be related to hahn polynomials  @xcite with parameters @xmath83 .",
    "the orthogonality of these hahn polynomials leads to : @xmath84    2\\delta_{n , n ' } , & \\hbox{if } n = n ,    \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the extra factor 2 for @xmath86 appears because for that case one has to take a limit of the squared norm of the hahn polynomial , so one gets another factor than in the other cases where one can just substitute @xmath83 .",
    "equation   is the underlying equation proving the orthogonality of the columns of @xmath68 .",
    "the extra factor 2 is also responsible for the extra factors @xmath87 when @xmath88 .",
    "this proposition gives us essentially the eigenvalues @xmath89 of the position operator @xmath30 .",
    "there are @xmath90 distinct eigenvalues and they are given by : @xmath91 or in general : @xmath92    in figure  1 , we present a plot of the spectrum of the position operator for the @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 oscillator models .",
    "one observes that the spectrum of the position operator is quite different compared to the finite - discrete oscillator models already known .",
    "the main difference is the distribution of positions . for the @xmath1 oscillator model ,",
    "the positions are equidistant ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the distribution of positions for the @xmath6 model is not equidistant , due to @xmath94 . in that case , the interval covering the positions is smaller than the corresponding one for the @xmath1 case .",
    "comparing the @xmath5 case with two others , we observe that some of its properties overlap with @xmath1 and others with @xmath6 .",
    "the interval covering the positions is the same for the @xmath1 and the @xmath5 model : @xmath95 .",
    "both the @xmath6 and @xmath5 oscillator models have a non - equidistant distribution of the position eigenvalues .",
    "the main feature of the @xmath5 oscillator model is that the position values are concentrated near the border of the inteval @xmath96 $ ] , whereas near the middle of the interval the distribution is sparse .    , ( a )  in the case of the @xmath1 model , ( b )  in the case of the @xmath6 model and ( c )  in the case of the @xmath5 model.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the position wavefunctions of the @xmath5 finite - discrete oscillator model are defined in a similar way as in  @xcite .",
    "their explicit expression is computed through the overlap between the @xmath30-eigenvectors @xmath97 and the @xmath28-eigenvectors @xmath98 . let us denote them by @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , and where @xmath89 assumes one of the discrete values of @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "simple computations show that @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the matrix elements of @xmath41 .",

    "despite the fact that the non - relativistic one - dimensional quantum oscillator in the canonical approach has a nice explicit solution in terms of hermite polynomials , there are still attempts to construct new oscillator models inspired by different starting points .",
    "one of these starting points is the assumption of discrete space , in which case one is looking for oscillator models with a discrete position spectrum ( which could be finite of infinite discrete ) .",

    "we have first defined a new algebra , formally called the @xmath1 algebra under the @xmath0 deformation .",
    "the representations of this algebra were given and are similar to representations of @xmath1 , but the action of the raising and lowering operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 differs considerably . as a consequence , when considering the oscillator model related to this algebra , the matrix representations of position and momentum operators is also different . in the standard @xmath98 bases , the position operator is tridiagonal , and we have shown that its eigenvalues and eigenvectors involve krawtchouk polynomials .",
    "the matrix relation for the eigenvalue problem is equivalent to certain finite difference equations for krawtchouk polynomials .",
    "the resulting model is unique in the sense that it does not generalize any other existing oscillator model .",
