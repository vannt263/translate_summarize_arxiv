    "with the advent of the sub - arcsec x - ray imaging capability of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( weisskopf et al .  2003 ) , observations of galaxies out to the virgo cluster routinely detect tens to hundreds of x - ray sources above detection limits of @xmath5  ergs  s@xmath2(fabbiano & white 2006 ) .",

    ", the light curves can be used to constrain the system orbital parameters and even the mass of the compact object if suitable additional information is available such as an estimate of the companion star mass via spectral and luminosity - class typing ( see , e.g. , weisskopf et al . 2004 ; pietsch et al .  2004 ; pooley & rappaport 2005 ; fabbiano et al . 2006 ) .",

    "equation ( 3 ) is analogous to the classical radius - mass relation ( e.g. , eq.[3 ] of pooley & rappaport 2005 ; see also the discussion in weisskopf et al.2004 ) for roche - lobe filling donor stars , but is generalized via eggleton s ( 1983 ) expression for @xmath42 for virtually any mass ratio .",
    "the function @xmath48 differs by less than 10% from unity for @xmath49 , and increases to a value of only 1.35 as @xmath50 .",
    "an additional feature of eq.(3 ) is that the factor @xmath37 allows for donor stars that underfill their roche lobes .",
    "a plot of eq.(3 ) , with @xmath51 hr , is shown in figure  [ fig : rofm ] in the radius  mass plane of the donor star .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) red curve is for all @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) ; both curves are for @xmath54 ( i.e. , a roche - lobe filling donor ) .",
    "the lower red dot - dashed curve represents the case where the donor star fills only 3/4 of its roche lobe , and @xmath55 .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) green curve is a simple @xmath56 relation for zero age ( terminal age ) h - burning main - sequence stars , while the solid ( dashed ) blue curve is the @xmath56 relation for zero age ( terminal age ) he - burning main - sequence stars ( see , e.g. , paczyski 1971 ; kato & iben 1992 ; justham & podsiadlowski 2006 , private communication ) . for completeness",
    ", we show , as an orange curve , the @xmath56 relation for degenerate he stars .    from an inspection of figure  [ fig : rofm ] , and the intersection of the red curves with the green and blue curves , we can draw some basic conclusions about the nature of the donor star .    _ hydrogen - burning companion star _",
    "one obvious interpretation of the nature of the eclipsing binary is a normal main - sequence donor star with a mass of @xmath170.4  m@xmath4(the intersection of the green and red curves of figure  [ fig : rofm ] ) .",
    "this , coupled with an orbital period of 3.62 hr , evokes either a conventional low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) in ngc 4214 , or a cataclysmic variable binary ( cv ) with a white dwarf accretor in our own galaxy . in the former case",
    ", an important question would be how an unevolved , low - mass donor star could drive a sufficiently high rate of mass transfer to account for @xmath57  ergs  s@xmath2 .",
    "mass transfer from an unevolved 0.4  m@xmath4  star is induced by orbital decay through gravitational radiation and magnetic braking ( see , e.g. , rappaport , verbunt , & joss 1983 ) .",
    "the mass transfer rate would then be low and we estimate the corresponding x - ray luminosity would range from only @xmath58  ergs  s@xmath2  ( for gravitational radiation and a neutron star accretor ) to @xmath59  ergs  s@xmath2  ( for magnetic braking and a stellar - mass black hole accretor ) .    in the case that cxou",
    "j121538  is a cv in our own galaxy , the shape of the x - ray eclipse ( see , figs .",
    "[ fig : alllc ] and  [ fig : foldedlc ] ) is reminiscent of that of am her systems ( heise et al .  1985 ) .",
    "if cvs are confined to the galactic disk with a scale height @xmath60  pc , then cxou  j121538 , in this interpretation , would be within @xmath171  kpc , corresponding to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath176@xmath910@xmath61  ergs  s@xmath2 , or about 1/3 of the average luminosity for am  her systems ( see , e.g. , ramsay & cropper 2003 ) .",
    "there are no physical solutions for extremely    or even moderately",
    "  evolved normal main - sequence stars which would more naturally drive the high rate of mass transfer implied for a system at the distance of ngc  4214 .    _ helium - burning companion star _    another obvious possibility for the nature of the binary is a he - burning star in a binary with either a neutron - star or stellar - mass black - hole accretor ( see also weisskopf et al .",
    "the intersection of the various orbital constraint ( red ) curves with the he - star ( blue ) curves in fig.4 yield a range of possible combinations of he - star mass and accretor mass .",
    "for example , a @xmath1712  m@xmath4  he - zams star could fill its roche with an accretor of comparable mass ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) , e.g. , a @xmath1712  m@xmath4  black hole .",
    "alternatively , a more massive he - zams donor of @xmath1723  m@xmath4  would fill its roche lobe with a much less massive accretor , e.g. , a neutron star . or a @xmath177  m@xmath4he - zams donor could underfill its roche lobe ( by a factor of , e.g. , 3/4 ) and still achieve substantial mass transfer via a stellar wind .",
    "however , for reasons discussed below , perhaps the most promising interpretation is an intermediate - mass he star ( e.g. , @xmath1723",
    "m@xmath4 ) that is somewhat evolved , with approximately twice its main - sequence radius , or near the he terminal - age main sequence ( tams ) .      for the case where the x - ray eclipse is due to the compact accretor going behind the companion star , we can also use the eclipse duration to learn more about the constituent masses of the binary . note that these constraints would therefore pertain to the case of the he - star companion , but probably not to an am her - type eclipse .",
    "we modify the expression for the eclipse half angle , @xmath63 , from eq.(4 ) of pooley & rappaport ( 2005 ; see also weisskopf et al .",
    "2004 ) to allow for arbitrary mass ratios , @xmath45 , : @xmath64 ~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the orbital inclination angle , and @xmath66}~~,\\ ] ] ( eggleton 1983 ) . a plot of @xmath67 is shown in fig .",

    "the horizontal lines denote our estimates for the maximum and minimum observed eclipse half angles .",
    "we have not performed any detailed eclipse calculations for the case where a stellar wind accounts for an appreciable portion of the x - ray modulation .",
    "given the limited statistical precision associated with the x - ray light curves , we can say only that the drop in intensity more closely resembles a classical x - ray eclipse , i.e. , as in a high - mass x - ray binary , than a wind - modulated light curve , e.g. , x1908 + 075 ( levine et al .",
    "2004 ) .        from the intersection of the two horizontal curves with the @xmath67 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse ] , we conclude that the mass ratio in this system is @xmath71 this range of @xmath45 values is consistent with the illustrative system components suggested above . in particular ,",
    "unevolved he stars of mass @xmath72  m@xmath4  could have a black - hole accretor of @xmath73  m@xmath4  ( intersection of solid blue with solid and dot - dashed red curves in fig.4 ) .",
    "higher mass he stars ( i.e. , @xmath7422  m@xmath4 ) would require much less massive accretors ( e.g. , neutron stars ; intersection of solid blue and dashed red curves ) . finally , somewhat evolved he stars of @xmath75  m@xmath4  could have neutron - star or very low - mass black hole accretors .",
    "our observations of a 3.62-hr eclipse in the source cxou  j121538  have yielded three distinct possibilities for the nature of the binary .",
    "we discuss the pros and cons of each in turn .      as discussed above , in the context of the orbital constraints ,",
    "if the donor is a h - rich , low - mass star it can not be very evolved .",
    "thus , it is unclear how an unevolved , low - mass donor star could drive a sufficiently high rate of mass transfer to account for values of @xmath0 that approach @xmath1 ergs s@xmath2 during several different observations spanning nearly 3 years    especially if the accretor were a neutron star",
    ". conventional black hole lmxbs , on the other hand , can have high luminosities but only during short transient outbursts .",
    "systems with short orbital periods like cxou  j121538   should either not be transients or , if they are , should not have such prolonged intervals of high @xmath76 ( see , e.g. , king et al .  1996 ; kalogera et al .  2004 ; fabbiano et al .",
    "2006 ) . moreover , if the accretor were a stellar - mass black hole then @xmath77 and the eclipse duration would be much shorter than observed ( figure  [ fig : eclipse ] ) .    in discussing a possible short orbital period ulx , liu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested beaming of the x - radiation to reduce the actual value of @xmath0 .",
    "given that cxou  j121538  is an eclipsing system this possibility seems remote , though not impossible if the accretor were a rapidly spinning black hole , and a large kick during its formation oriented the orbital plane perpendicular to the spin axis .",
    "for the case of an am her system , the eclipse would be caused by periodic occultations of the accreting magnetic polar cap as it rotates around the spin axis of the white dwarf . in this case , we can not infer anything further about the mass ratio of the binary constituents , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipse ] .",
    "thus , we focus here on the constraints set by the hst image ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hst ] ) , and an evaluation of the probability of finding a high galactic latitude ( @xmath78 ) am her binary within the @xmath79 area of ngc  4214 . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : optical ] , the limiting visual magnitude for any counterpart to cxou  j121538  is 22.6 .",
    "however , at @xmath80 hr , we expect the donor star in an am her system to be roughly of intrinsic spectral type @xmath81 with visual magnitude @xmath82 . from the optical limit , this requires the source to be at least 2.6 to 5.5  kpc away . thus ,",
    "unless the hypothesized am her system is in the galactic halo , the observed constraint on its magnitude seems difficult to reconcile with its expected brightness .",
    "it also seems somewhat unusual that an am her system would be found by chance so close ( @xmath83 ) to a particular galaxy that is being observed with _",

    "thus , the a priori probability of finding a cv with @xmath96 hr within the 0.012 square degree area of the ngc  4214  @xmath79 ellipse seems quite small , i.e. , @xmath172@xmath910@xmath15 .    finally , in regard to finding a cv close to a galaxy of particular interest",
    ", we note that a similar circumstance has arisen in the case of cg x-1 in the field of the circinus galaxy ( weisskopf et al.2004 ) .",
    "this particular eclipsing source had an orbital period of 7.5 hr , which already is quite long for an am her system .",
    "the circinus galaxy is at @xmath97 ( compared to @xmath98 for cxou  j121538 ) , and therefore the probability of finding a chance foreground cv is higher than near the ngp .",
    "nonetheless , these two eclipsing sources , when taken together , reduce the likelihood that both are foreground cvs .",
    "overall , we find the hypothesis that cxou  j121538  is a foreground am her system to be implausible .",
    "if we interpret the cxou  j121538  system as having a naked he - burning donor star of mass somewhere in the range of @xmath99  m@xmath4 , the requisite mass - transfer rate , @xmath76 , could be achievable via either direct roche - lobe overflow or via bondi - hoyle capture ( see , e.g. , bondi & hoyle 1944 ) of a modest fraction of the stellar wind from the he star ( dewi et al.2002 ; justham et al.2006 ) .",

    "if the donor star is indeed a he - burning star , there is an additional constraint that the x - ray light curve neither appears to be dominated by modulation in a dense stellar wind , nor suffers from any obvious photoelectric ( i.e. , strongly energy - dependent ) absorption . for a simple @xmath103 stellar wind profile ,",
    "the column density as a function of orbital phase ( at @xmath104 ) has a simple analytic form : @xmath105 except for values of @xmath106 corresponding to direct geometric eclipse ( e.g. , levine et al .",

    "unless the stellar wind is essentially completely ionized , the optical depth to soft x - rays would be enormous . for stellar - wind density profiles that start with zero velocity and infinite density at the stellar surface ( e.g. , lucy & solomon 1970 ; castor , abbott , & klein 1975 ) , the column densities would be larger , and the discrepancy with the observed light curve would be even greater . therefore ,",
    "if the donor star in cxou  j121538  is ultimately identified with a he star with @xmath112  m@xmath4 , this apparent lack of a dense stellar wind will have to be reconciled with the binary stellar model .    to quantify the constraint on the he - donor star set by the apparent lack of a strong stellar wind , we utilize the following expression for stellar - wind rates as a function of luminosity by hamann , koesterke , & wessolowski ( 1995 ) : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the bolometric luminosity of the he star .",
    "more recently , hamann & koesterke ( 1998 ) and petrovic , langer & van der hucht ( 2005 ) have suggested that the wind loss rates are lower than given by eq.(10 ) by factors of a few . only for luminosities",

    "we have also evaluated quantitatively the possibility that the cxou  j121538system is a foreground cv ( of the am her subtype ) .",
    "major difficulties with this scenario are ( i ) the improbability of finding an am her system aligned so closely , by chance , with a galaxy of interest ( even after taking into account the fact that _ chandra _ has observed a substantial number of such galaxies with equal exposure ) , and ( ii ) the lack of an optical counterpart brighter than 22.6  mag , requiring the cv be a halo object .",
    "we consider this possibility unlikely .",
    "the alternative is that the donor is a he - burning star .",
    "he - donor star masses @xmath119  m@xmath4  are difficult to reconcile with the apparent lack of a dense stellar wind .",
    "we believe that the most likely interpretation of this system is a @xmath75  m@xmath4  slightly evolved ( e.g. , tams ) naked he star transferring matter ( stably ) through the inner lagrange point to a neutron star . this type of binary has been extensively modeled by dewi et al.(2002 ) .",
    "if confirmed , this would open exciting possibilities for both stellar evolution studies ( see , e.g. , dewi et al.2002 ; justham et al .",
    "2006 ) and the interpretation of ultraluminous x - ray sources at the lower end of their luminosity function ( see , e.g. , colbert & miller 2004 ; fabbiano & white 2006 ) . in the case of cxou",
    "j121538 , the peak observed luminosity is only about twice the eddington limit for accretion of he onto a neutron star .",
    "if the accretor in such a system , i.e. , with a he donor star , were a stellar - mass black hole , then the eddington limit would be @xmath120  ergs  s@xmath2 ; well within the range of ultraluminous x - ray source luminosities .",
    "finally , we note that cxou  j121538  may be the first known _ immediate _ progenitor of a compact double neutron star binary ; i.e. , beyond the second common envelope phase and prior to collapse of the he star core .",
    "a perhaps unverifiable prediction is that within some @xmath121 years the evolved core of the he star will collapse to produce a type ib supernova explosion ( see , e.g. , podsiadlowski , joss , & hsu 1992 ; woosley , langer , & weaver 1995 ) and leave a binary radio pulsar ( if the natal kick given to the pulsar is not so large as to unbind the system ; see , e.g. , pfahl et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "the putative neutron star that is currently in the system is in the process of being spun up via accretion torques and will be the rapidly rotating pulsar member of the binary .",
    "it is also interesting to note that this predicted event has actually occurred already ( given the @xmath1710 myr light travel time for the information to reach us ) .",
