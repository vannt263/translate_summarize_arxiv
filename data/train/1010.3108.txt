    "the lhc machine has a unique potential for the study of cp violation and rare decays in the @xmath1 sector due to the combination of a large @xmath0 production cross - section and high luminosity . even at an average luminosity @xmath2 , well below the machine design value , @xmath3 pairs are produced per year , offering interesting perspectives in the quest for new physics with an approach complementary to those of atlas and cms @xcite .",
    "lhcb is the only experiment at lhc designed to exploit this potential with an optimized detector , which incorporates precision vertexing and tracking systems , particle identification over a wide momentum spectrum and the capability to trigger down to very small transverse momenta .",
    "lhcb can work for years at constant luminosity , independently from the other intersections , thus collecting clean events of constant quality .",
    "the results presented here correspond to the machine startup phase , with a reduced number of bunches and a value of @xmath4 tev .",
    "the total integrated luminosity at the time of this conference ( august 2010 ) amounts to @xmath5 . using the data",
    "collected we show that the various subdetectors perform as planned .",
    "the @xmath0 production cross - section has been measured by two independent methods and confirms the expectations on the sensitivity for the experiment .",

    "it is a single - arm open spectrometer using a large dipole magnet ( bending power 3.6 tm ) for momentum measurement .",
    "this geometry exploits the fact the @xmath0 production is peaked in the forward direction .",
    "the apparatus is described in detail in @xcite .    the lhcb detector is fully equipped since the startup of lhc , except for the online trigger and daq farm which is still under completion .",
    "the geometry of lhcb is not well suited to rely on cosmic rays for calibration purposes , therefore most of the calibration and alignment work has been performed with particles from beam - beam collisions but also using beam - dump and beam - gas interactions .",
    "the performances of the various subdetectors are summarized below .",
    "* _ tracking .",
    "_ * the tracking system comprises a silicon strip detector ( vertex locator or velo ) to reconstruct precisely the tracks close to the interaction region , followed by a larger silicon tracker before the magnet and by a hybrid tracker ( silicon plus straw tubes ) downstream of the magnet .",
    "the velo is made of 21 silicon planes of semi - circular shape close to the collision point , orthogonal to the beam direction ( along the @xmath6 axis ) .",
    "the sensor strips are arranged to measure @xmath7 and @xmath8 with a @xmath9 stereo angle to improve spatial reconstruction .",
    "the velo is mounted in a vacuum tank and the edges of the sensor planes are at few millimeters from the beam during data taking .",
    "they are retracted to @xmath10 cm from the beam during machine injection .",
    "the alignment among sensors is better than @xmath11 and the fill - to - fill variations are less than this value .",
    "this ensures excellent stability and hit resolution .",
    "the cluster finding efficiency is 99.7 % and the impact parameter resolution for high - momentum tracks is @xmath12 to be compared with 11.2 @xmath13 from mc .",
    "further improvement will be obtained by better alignment .",
    "the typical @xmath14resolution for a primary vertex with 25 tracks is @xmath15 . from the analysis of @xmath16",
    "decays a proper - time resolution of 60 fs has been obtained , giving excellent perspectives for time - dependent @xmath17 cp violation studies .",
    "following the velo is a large - area ( @xmath18 ) silicon strip detector ( tt or trigger tracker ) upstream of the magnet .",
    "downstream of the magnet there are three stations ( t1 to t3 ) using silicon strips in the inner part ( it ) and straw tubes on the outer part ( ot ) .",
    "the hit resolution is @xmath19 in the tt and it and @xmath20 in the ot straw tubes .",
    "[ fig : ks ] shows a typical @xmath21 mass peak as measured with or without the use of the velo .",

    "rich1 uses a silica aerogel and a @xmath24 gas radiator , whereas rich2 uses @xmath25 gas .",
    "the readout is via hpd pixel tubes .",
    "the angular resolution for the gas radiators ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively for rich1 and rich2 ) is close to the design values .",
    "a resolution larger than expected is obtained for aerogel , partially due to gas contamination of the radiator , and work is ongoing to calibrate every single tile of the aerogel wall .",

    "the ecal is a shashlik - type sampling calorimeter , and its energy scale is calibrated to the 2 % level , yielding a resolution @xmath36 on the @xmath37 mass .",
    "reconstruction of multi - body decays with one @xmath37 in the final state is particularly encouraging ( fig .",

    "its task is extremely challenging since only @xmath44 of the events contain a @xmath0 and in addition the interesting channels have branching ratios smaller than @xmath45 . at the lowest level ( l0 )",
    "the trigger is designed around dedicated electronics hardware operating synchronously with the 40 mhz bunch - crossing frequency and uses high-@xmath42 particles in the calo and muon systems to reduce the data rate from the 40 mhz bunch crossing frequency to 1 mhz .",
    "the entire detector can be readout at this frequency .",
    "the output of l0 is fed to the software high level trigger ( hlt ) , running asynchronously on a computer farm that will have 14000 processor cores in its final phase .",
    "the hlt adds the informations from the tracking subdetectors ( hlt1 ) and passes the interesting events for further analysis to hlt2 .",
    "hlt2 has the capability of full event reconstruction to select the events to be written on tape at 2 khz . in the present startup phase",
    "the demand on the trigger is very much reduced and therefore the hlt2 has been running in pass - through mode , and the selections cuts for @xmath42 and impact parameter in l0 and hlt1 have been softened .",
    "the total efficiency for @xmath46 decays is at present @xmath47 for hadronic modes , and @xmath48 for leptonic modes .",
    "in addition the relaxed cuts yield a large efficiency for charm events .",
    "the first data taken with the lhcb experiment at 7 tev centre - of - mass energy have allowed the measurement of the @xmath49 production cross - section in the lhcb acceptance . beyond the intrinsic interest of this measurement , knowledge of the @xmath1 yield",
    "is also critical in ascertaining the sensitivity of the lhcb experiment in flavour physics .",
