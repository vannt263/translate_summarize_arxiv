    "copious x - rays are produced in the inner disk @xcite . in the case of ns lmxbs",
    ", there is also strong x - ray emission from the boundary layer formed by the settling of the accretion flow onto the ns surface @xcite .",

    "bh lmxbs constitute the majority of bh x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) known in our galaxy , though a few bhbs with a high - mass stellar companion also exist .",
    "bhbs exhibit three main x - ray spectral states : the hard state , the thermal state , and the steep power law ( spl ) state @xcite .",
    "these states are normally described with spectral models consisting of two main continuum components : a standard thermal multi - color disk ( mcd , _ diskbb _ in xspec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a comptonized component ( often modeled with a single power law , pl , or the comptonization model _ comptt _ in xspec ) . the hard state , which tends to occur below several percent of the eddington luminosity ( @xmath12 ) , is characterized by a strong comptonized component dominating the spectra at least above @xmath22 kev and extending to more than 100 kev . a weak , cool thermal disk might also be detected , with the maximum disk temperature @xmath13@xmath141 kev .",
    "the thermal state , which is normally observed at high luminosities , is characterized by a strong disk component with @xmath15 0.51 kev and the disk fraction of @xmath16 in 210 kev ( as defined in * ? ? ?",
    "a weak comptonized component is also often present but only dominates at high energies .",
    "the spl state tends to occur at very high luminosities ( @xmath170.1 @xmath12 ) , and the hallmark of this state is a strong comptonizaton component with photon index @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a sizable thermal component is also normally seen in this state .",
    "almost all known galactic bh lmxbs are transients .",
    "they often show hysteresis in transitions to and from the hard state , with the transition to the hard state occuring at luminosities tightly clustered around 2% of the eddington value @xcite , and the transition from the hard state at higher but more scattered luminosities @xcite .",
    "similar hysteresis behavior is observed in transient ns lmxbs .",
    "there are two main classes of ns lmxbs , atoll and z sources @xcite , named after the patterns that they trace out in x - ray color - color diagrams ( cds ) or hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids ) .",
    "atolls radiate at @xmath20.0010.5 @xmath12 and trace out their patterns in cds / hids on timescales of weeks to months .",
    "they have two main distinct spectral states , i.e. , hard ( @xmath192 , extending to 100 kev or above ) and soft states ( most emission @xmath2020 kev ) . the hard state tends to be observed at low luminosity ( @xmath200.1 @xmath12 ) , while the soft state is normally observed at high luminosity ( larger than a few percent @xmath12 ) .",
    "spectra in the `` transitional '' state between these two are also occasionally seen .",
    "z sources are more luminous than atolls , at near or above eddington luminosity , and they trace out roughly z - shaped tracks in cds / hids within a few days ( i.e. , faster than atolls ) , with x - ray spectra that are generally soft . thanks to a recent transient z source , which exhibited the z - source characteristics when it was accreting at near or above eddington luminosity and transitioned to an atoll during the decay of its 2006 - 2007 outburst , we now know that z and atoll sources are essentially the same type of objects at different mass accretion rates @xcite . unlike bhbs , whose tracks in the cds / hids tend to show large scatter , mainly due to the presence of the spl state , ns lmxbs tend to trace out clear narrow tracks in the cds / hids , which depend mostly on the accretion rate @xcite",
    ".    the spectral modeling for ns lmxbs is complicated by the presence of the boundary layer emission and is relatively controversial , compared to bhbs .",
    "@xcite used a similar spectral model to the one used for bhbs ( described above ) except for an additional single - temperature blackbody ( bb ) to describe the boundary layer and were able to infer @xmath21 trends for both the disk and the boundary layer in the soft state of two atolls .",
    "such a trend for the disk is often observed for the thermal state of bhbs and is expected if the disk is essentially thermal and is truncated at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) .",
    "@xcite applied this model to and also observed the @xmath21 trends for both the disk and the boundary layer in its atoll stage .",
    "however , such trends were not observed in its z - source stage , because the inner disk and the boundary layer both reach the local eddington limit in this stage so that the increase in the accretion rate tends to lead to an increase in the emission area with relatively constant temperature ( increasing the inner disk radius at constant inner disk temperature for the accretion disk ) .",
    "our knowledge of x - ray binaries in nearby galaxies has significantly increased since the launch of _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra x - ray observatory _ in 1999 . in particular , _ chandra _ s superb spatial resolution and excellent sensitivity @xcite allow for population studies of x - ray binaries in a single galaxy with snapshots , which is important for understanding the origin and evolution of such sources . to fully understand these sources , one key task is to identify their nature ( i.e. , bh versus ns x - ray binaries ) and the x - ray spectral state . to achieve this",
    ", early studies tried to stack sources in luminosity ranges in order to improve the statistics @xcite .",
    "recently , relatively detailed studies of individual sources in nearby galaxies were carried out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but limited by statistics , these studies have been mostly focused on the few most luminous sources ( above several @xmath22 erg s@xmath5 ) in each galaxy .",
    "it turns out that the differentiation between bh and ns x - ray binaries is generally very difficult .",
    "this is because most sources have x - ray spectra that are relatively hard ( @xmath23 ) in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ bandpass ( about 0.38 kev ) and it is difficult to determine whether they are bhbs in the hard state or ns lmxbs in the soft state ( they are unlikely to be ns lmxbs in the hard state due to the high luminosities of the sources studied ) .",
    "ns lmxbs in the soft state can appear hard in such an energy band because of the presence of the hot boundary layer component in the x - ray spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we note that s36 ( figure  [ fig : lc_sub_epoch3 ] ) , which was bright in the third epoch , seems to show some emission in the first two epochs , making it not formally a good transient candidate , but this might be due to extended emission near the galactic center .",

    "such properties are similar to those of the brightest field sources .    based on the above comparison",
    ", we suggest that the light gray region in figures  [ fig : plindexflux ] and [ fig : mcdktflux ] marks a ns lmxb soft state track , with sources below @xmath9 erg  s@xmath5 being atolls in the soft state and brighter sources being z sources .",
    "then our observation that most of our sources appear harder at higher luminosity in 0.38 kev can be easily explained because for the atoll soft state , the temperatures of the disk and boundary layer thermal emission increase with luminosity at relatively constant emission areas @xcite . such trends are not seen in z sources because the inner disk and the boundary layer reach the local eddington limit , in which case the change in the accretion rate tends to lead to change in the emission area ( the inner radius for the disk ) , instead of the temperature @xcite .",
    "we note that our sources seem systematically slightly softer than the simulated spectra of galactic ns lmxbs , and one explanation for this is the possible presence of soft excess of the real disk spectrum compared with the simple mcd description ( i.e. , _ diskbb _ in xspec ) used in @xcite and @xcite , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : doublethermalmethod ] .",
    "although the soft - state observations of in @xcite are above @xmath110 erg  s@xmath5 , atolls in the soft state can be fainter .",
    "for example , the soft state of has eddington ratios as low as 0.01 @xcite , four times lower than in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the atoll soft - state explanation could apply to our relatively soft ( @xmath111 ) faint sources with @xmath1 as low as a few @xmath24 erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "as mentioned above , we also have nine very soft outliers ( filled circles and triangles in the middle panels in figures  [ fig : plindexflux ] and [ fig : mcdktflux ] ) .",
    "they are much softer than ns lmxbs at corresponding luminosities , but are similar to the bhc in the thermal state .",
    "therefore , we identified them as bhcs .",
    "their long - term luminosity curves and sample spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : lc_sub ] ( those fitted with a mcd or a mcd+pl model ) , and the pl and mcd fit results are given in table  [ tbl : plmcdfit ] .",
    "the spectra of most of these bhcs can be described with a mcd , except s100 .",
    "this source seems to show a hard tail , and we tried to fit it with a mcd plus a pl , with the photon index fixed at a value of 2.5 . the fitting result is included in table  [ tbl : spfitextra ] , indicating the presence of a pl at the @xmath26 confidence level .",
    "s198 is an interesting bhc that will be described separately in section  [ sec : s198 ] .",
    "it is the only source with two spectra ( one in the high state and the other in the low state , section  [ sec : s198 ] , figure  [ fig : lc_sub_epoch3 ] ) in figures  [ fig : plindexflux ] and [ fig : mcdktflux ] .    the faint hard sources with @xmath95 erg  s@xmath5 and @xmath112 could be atolls in the hard state , similar to the two hard - state spectra of ( the two filled diamonds below @xmath113 erg  s@xmath5 in figures  [ fig : plindexflux ] and [ fig : mcdktflux ] ) .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that there may be some bhbs in the hard state .",
    "for example , simulating the hard - state spectrum of the bhb studied by @xcite and fitting with a pl , as we did above for other three galactic x - ray binaries , gave @xmath114 erg  s@xmath5 and @xmath115 .",
    "however , considering that ns lmxbs are expected to be more common than bhbs , the possibility being bhbs should be low .",
    "our pl fits to simulated spectra of three galactic x - ray binaries in the soft / thermal state systematically gave column densities larger than the value assumed in the simulation ( i.e. , the galactic value toward ngc 3115 ; see the bottom right panel in figure  [ fig : plindexflux ] ) .",
    "therefore , the column densities from the pl fits to our sources are systematically overestimated if our identification of our sources ( i.e. , most sources are ns lmxbs in the soft state with the very soft outliers being bhbs in the thermal state ) is correct . on the contrary , the mcd fits tend to underestimate the column density , due to the presence of a hard component ( weak comptonization in the case of bhbs in the thermal state or the boundary layer emission in the case of ns lmxbs in the soft state ) and/or possible extra soft emission of the real disk spectrum relative to the mcd description , which will be discussed in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "there is one main caveat of the above comparison of our sources with galactic sources to be kept in mind .",
    "to have enough statistics , we have to use the spectra of our sources accumulated over long exposures ( @xmath21.1 ms ) and spanning more than a decade , though most data were made from the xvp , which still covered nearly three months .",
    "to reduce this problem , we have created spectra for transients carefully by combining only observations with similar fluxes . for the other sources ,",
    "if @xmath116 erg s@xmath5 , most sources have the long - term variability @xmath117 , which is not large enough to affect our comparison with galactic sources significantly .",
    "however , for fainter sources , their long - term variability is uncertain , and there might be relatively large systematic errors produced by the dependence of the spectral properties on the luminosity obtained .      on the whole , the simple pl and mcd fits indicate that gc lmxbs have spectral properties very similar to those of field lmxbs ( compare the left panels for gc lmxbs and the right panels for field lmxbs in figures  [ fig : plindexflux ] and [ fig : mcdktflux ] ) . in particular , most gc sources are also in the ns lmxb soft state track ( the light gray region ) , which exhibits a trend of decreasing @xmath7 or increasing @xmath8 with increase in @xmath1 below @xmath9 erg  s@xmath5 and relatively constant @xmath7 ( @xmath118 ) or @xmath8 ( @xmath118 kev ) above this luminosity .",
    "as discussed in the previous section for field lmxbs , most of our gc lmxbs below and above @xmath9 erg  s@xmath5 in this track could be atolls in the soft state and z sources , respectively .",
    "some hard sources with @xmath119 below @xmath120 erg  s@xmath5 are also present , and they could be ns or bh lmxbs in the hard state .",
    "it seems that gc lmxbs have more hard sources at luminosities around @xmath22 erg  s@xmath5 than field lmxbs .",
    "for example , over the range @xmath121@xmath122 erg  s@xmath5 , there are six out of 10 gc lmxbs with @xmath123 , but there is only one out of 14 field lmxbs with @xmath123 , from the pl fits .",

    "using the mcd model , we obtained @xmath134 kev for the high state and @xmath135 kev for the low state .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of s198 in the low state in the 2012 outburst is much softer than in the high state .",

    "we note that the hard x - ray source in bo158 in m31 showed periodic dips occasionally and thus probably has a high inclination @xcite .",
    "therefore we speculate an alternative explanation for the hard spectra of the above sources : they might have high inclination angles , which suppress the observed disk emission and enhance the observed boundary layer emission and thus cause the hard x - ray spectra ( but the inclination should not be too high for the boundary layer to be strongly obscured by the disk ) .",
    "limited by statistics , we can not determine whether the short - term variability of our source s223 in observation 11 is due to dipping .",

    "@xcite generally gave consistent source identifications , mostly based on the disk temperature from the mcd fits only , and our more detailed comparison with galactic ns lmxbs makes the identification of the source nature and spectral state more convincing .",
    "given that @xcite successfully fitted thousands of ns lmxb soft - state spectra with the double thermal model ( mcd+bb ) , plus a weak comptonized component when necessary , @xcite applied the double thermal model to 35 sources in m31 showing bright hard spectra and found them to be bhcs because their best - fitting parameters lie significantly outside the space occupied by ns lmxbs .",
    "in particular , they found that the disk temperatures of their bhcs from the fits with the double thermal model are systematically lower ( @xmath168 kev ) than those of typical ns lmxb soft - state spectra ( @xmath169 kev ) , and the bb fractions of the 210 kev flux are also larger ( @xmath2565% versus @xmath2750% ) .",

    "we found that they all have @xmath172 kev , and 27 of them have the upper error of @xmath8 at the 90% confidence level @xmath173 kev .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , this would indicate that almost all bright sources with @xmath174 erg  s@xmath5 in ngc 3115 are bhcs , which seems very unlikely , considering that bhbs are expected to be much rarer than ns lmxbs in an early - type galaxy like ngc 3115 @xcite .",
    "we note that we are using a narrower and softer energy band and have sources subject to much less absorption than @xcite .",
    "these differences could cause problems if the double thermal model is directly applied to our sources .",
    "we estimated the possible systematic errors arising from the use of a narrow energy band . using the brightest observation ( suz4 ) of 4u 1705 - 44 in @xcite , which has @xmath175 kev and a bb fraction of 30% in 210 kev , we simulated 200 spectra with galactic absorption in the direction of ngc 3115 and then fitted them with the double thermal model with the column density fixed at the galactic value .",
    "we obtained a median of @xmath176 kev ( the error bar corresponds to the 90% confidence level in the sense that the upper and lower error bars each include 45% of the fits ) .",
    "we also found that 77% and 46% of the simulated spectra have the best - fitting bb fraction in 210 kev larger than 30% ( the bb fraction of suz4 ) and 50% , respectively .",
    "the above simulation results indicate that the use of the limited energy band could systematically infer a lower disk temperature and more bb contribution in 210 kev than expected .",
    "we investigated whether the sources could be fitted well if the temperatures of the double thermal components are fixed at values typically seen in ns lmxbs .",
    "we concentrate on six bright sources ( the two brightest persistent field lmxbs ( s25 and s68 ) , the brightest transient field lmxb ( s35 ) , the two brightest persistent lmxbs in gcs ( s200 in a blue gc and s212 in a red gc ) and the brightest transient gc lmxb ( s8 ) ; see table  [ tbl : spfitextra ] ) .",
    "because they all have near or super - eddington luminosity ( @xmath163 erg  s@xmath5 , brighter than the brightest observation ( suz4 ) of 4u 1705 - 44 in @xcite ) , we expect them to be z sources if they are ns lmxbs",
    ". then they should have @xmath8 around 1.7 kev and @xmath177 around 2.5 kev based on the double thermal model @xcite .",
    "therefore we also fitted them with the temperatures of the thermal components fixed at these values .",
    "the fit results are given in table  [ tbl : spfitextra ] , and the residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : mcdbbfitratio ] . the fits overall seem fine , but below around 1 kev , we can see a clear systematic soft excess in all sources .",
    "one possible explanation of such a soft excess is that the real disk spectrum is broader than the simple mcd description .",
    "a detailed disk model should carefully calculate radiative transfer through the vertical structure of the disk and account for the relativistic smearing .",
    "this is implemented in the relativistic disk model _",
    "bhspec _ , which indicates that the real disk spectrum should have excess emission relative to the mcd description by more than 10% at low energies @xcite .",
    "because nss tend to have a hotter disk , resulting in more of the low - energy part of the disk spectrum to be observed in the _ chandra _ bandpass than would be the case for bhs , the soft excess of the real disk spectrum relative to the mcd description is expected to be more obvious for nss than for bhs .",
    "such soft excess was not seen by @xcite because they used spectra above 1 kev and the sources that they studied had much higher absorption than the sources studied here .",
    "however , _",
    "bhspec _ has two limitations , preventing us from applying it to our sources .",
    "one is that it is a table model for the bh accretion disk with the minimum bh mass @xmath136 of 3 , not suitable for the accretion disk around nss .",
    "besides , the model assumes that the inner disk radius is at the isco , which is not necessarily the case for our luminous sources , whose inner disk could reach the local eddington limit and thus be truncated outside the isco @xcite .",
    "given the above possible soft excess problem , we did not use the mcd+bb fits to find more bhcs , other than those identified in section  [ sec : sppr ] based on their very soft spectra , a characteristic that is not seen in ns lmxbs .",
    "we have studied lmxbs detected in ngc 3115 using the megasecond _ chandra _ xvp observations . including three previous observations , the total exposure time is 1.1 ms .",
    "thus ngc 3115 is one of _ chandra _ s best observed galaxies . in total",
    "we have 136 candidate lmxbs in the field and 49 in gcs detected above @xmath46 , with @xmath1 in the range of @xmath210@xmath3 erg  s@xmath5 to 10@xmath4 erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "we calculated the long - term variability for all sources and identified 13 transient candidates , whose long - term variability factors are @xmath178 . excluding these transients , the sources have long - term variability overall decreasing with increase in luminosity , at least at @xmath6 erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "we carried out simple fits to our sources using single - component models ( a simple pl or a mcd ) .",
    "we found that in the @xmath1 versus @xmath7 and @xmath1 versus @xmath8 plots a majority of our sources fall on a narrow track , showing harder spectra at higher luminosity below @xmath158 erg  s@xmath5 but relatively constant spectral shape ( @xmath1791.5 or @xmath180 kev ) above this luminosity .",
    "because our simulations showed that galactic ns lmxbs in the soft state show similar spectral evolution in the _ chandra _ bandpass , we identified the track as the ns lmxb soft state track and suggested sources below @xmath9 erg  s@xmath5 as atolls in the soft state and sources above this luminosity as z sources .",
    "however , the spectra of our sources seem to show systematic soft excess relative to the double thermal ( mcd+bb ) modeling by @xcite of galactic ns lmxbs .",
    "one explanation for this is that the real disk spectrum has excess soft emission relative to the mcd description .",
