    "the study of resolved galactic stellar populations provides a powerful tool for determining the physical parameters of a galaxy such as the star formation history , the chemical composition and enrichment history , and dynamical history of the system . by studying large numbers of individual stars , and interpreting the observable parameters such as the morphology of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , kinematics , and metallicity it is possible to gain vital clues concerning the evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , hodge 1989 ; olszewski , suntzeff , & mateo 1996 ; freeman & bland - hawthorn 2002 )",
    "however , it is sobering to realize that much of our knowledge of the detailed star formation histories ( sfh ) of galaxies beyond 1  gyr ago comes from the milky way and its nearest satellites ( within @xmath4 200 kpc ) . in the past ,",
    "the limiting factors have been crowding , resolution limits , and sensitivity for accurate stellar photometry from the ground . within the local group",
    "we always detect a ` halo ' of red stars ( i.e. , the ` baade sheet ; ' baade 1963 ) , which corresponds to the tip of the first ascent of the red giant branch ( indicative of old stars ) . for those galaxies with adequate observations , the presence of stars as old as those in globular clusters ( @xmath6 gyr )",
    "have been detected via the presence of rr  lyrae stars ( e.g. , ic  1613 , saha et al .",
    "nonetheless , quantitative information on the sfh at all epochs , and particularly for ages greater than 1  gyr , comes primarily from the study of main sequence turnoff luminosities .",
    "thus , hst provides a unique opportunity to extend the sample beyond the immediate vicinity and influence of large galaxies like the milky way or m31 .    in the nearby dwarf spheroidal satellites of our galaxy , the complex sfhs which had been indicated early on ( e.g. , mould & aaronson 1983 ) have recently been revealed completely ( see reviews by gallagher & wyse 1994 ; da costa 1998 ; mateo 1998 ; grebel 1999 ; van den bergh 2000a ) . while , on the one hand , all stars in the draco , sculptor and umi dwarfs are ` old ' ( @xmath7 10 gyr ) as evidenced by a unique turnoff at @xmath8 , the carina , fornax , leo  ii and leo  i dwarfs all exhibit turnoff stars at luminosities ranging from @xmath24.0 to @xmath21.5 , showing conclusively that star formation has occurred over several gyr in these objects ( e.g. , mighell 1990 ; lee et al .",
    "1993 ; smecker - hane et al .  1994 ; mighell & rich 1996 ; mighell 1997 ; hurley - keller , mateo , & nemec 1998 ; gallart et al .  1999a , b ; dolphin 2002 ) .",
    "these objects _ do _ have some stars as old as in the mw globular clusters , but the majority of stars are of intermediate age . these stunning results",
    "fundamentally shape our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by clearly demonstrating the varieties of sfhs in nearby low mass dwarf spheroidals . in the lmc and smc ,",
    "in addition to ongoing star formation , the large range of field star ages attest to continued star formation at all epochs in the past ( see holtzman et al .",
    "1999 ; hatzidimitriou 1999 ) .",
    "all this is in accord with the working hypothesis that all galaxies began forming stars more than 10 gyr ago , and that star formation continues until the gas is used up or expelled .",
    "it is important to extend studies of this type to larger distances because the galactic satellite galaxies constitute an extremely incomplete sample that is environmentally biased by the proximity to the galaxy .",
    "the next logical step is to examine the fossil record of star formation in galaxies of various types and sizes , and to identify both commonalities and differences in their sfhs .",
    "one simple and still unanswered question is how dirr and dsph galaxies are related ( faber & lin 1983 ; lin & faber 1983 ; kormendy 1985 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; gallagher & wyse 1994 ; skillman & bender 1995 ; mateo 1998 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 : skillman , ct , & miller 2003 ; grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 ) .    the approach of gaining a detailed understanding of nearby galaxies is a stepping stone to understanding galaxy evolution , and thus provides a physical basis for understanding observations of high red - shift galaxies and their implications for cosmological models ( tolstoy 1999 ; hopkins , irwin , & connolly 2001 ) .",
    "often , dwarf galaxies are called upon to solve a number of observationally motivated problems . in the last decade , it has been suggested that dwarf galaxies are responsible for enriching the intracluster medium ( trentham 1994 ; but see nath & chiba 1995 ) and the intergalactic medium ( nath & trentham 1997 ; murakami & babul 1999 ) .",
    "there have been suggestions that the `` faint blue galaxy '' problem ( tyson 1988 ; koo & kron 1992 ; colless et al .",
    "1993 ; lilly 1993 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "1995 ) could be solved by a bursting population of dwarf galaxies ( babul & rees 1992 ; babul & ferguson 1996 ) . the luminosity functions of dwarf galaxies provide a severe constraint on the cold dark matter cosmologies ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .  1999 ; gnedin 2000a ) . for all of these reasons ,",
    "a better understanding of the sfhs of dwarf galaxies will help us to better understand the evolution of all galaxies .",
    "ic  1613 is a member of our local group and one of the nearest gas rich irregular galaxies ( for a review of the properties of ic  1613 see van den bergh 2000a ) . because of its proximity , ic  1613 offers the opportunity to reconstruct a detailed sfh of a relatively isolated and non - interacting dwarf irregular galaxy ( as opposed to the significantly closer - and larger - magellanic clouds ) .",
    "ic  1613 also has very low foreground and internal reddening , and very reliable distances from cepheid and rr  lyr variable stars ( sandage 1971 ; freedman 1988 ; saha et al . 1992 ; dolphin et al .",
    "2001b , hereafter d01 ) .",
    "it is located at a distance of 730  kpc ( d01 ) , approximately 250  kpc above the m31-milky way axis ( grebel 2001 ) , and is included in the diffuse `` local group cloud '' of galaxies by mateo ( 1998 ) .",
    "the physical parameters of ic  1613 were summarized in cole et al .",
    "( 1999 , c99 ) , which presented a wfpc2 stellar population study of a central field of ic  1613 .",
    "these properties are normal for an i m  v galaxy with a moderate luminosity ( @xmath915.2 ) and a small value of the maximum amplitude of the rotation curve ( v@xmath10 @xmath0 25 km s@xmath11 , lake & skillman 1989 ) . its star formation rate ( sfr ) of 0.003  @xmath12  yr@xmath11 given by mateo ( 1998 ; cf . , hunter & gallagher 1986 ) is also normal for its type and luminosity . the current ism oxygen abundance",
    "as determined from hii regions ranges from 12 @xmath2 log ( o / h ) @xmath0 7.83 ( peimbert , bohigas , & torres - peimbert 1988 ) , which corresponds to 14% of the solar oxygen abundance as determined by allende prieto , lambert & asplund ( 2002 ) , to 12 @xmath2 log ( o / h ) @xmath0 7.62 ( lee , grebel , & hodge 2003 ) corresponding to 8.5% of the solar value .",
    "this is slightly less than that of the smc , and normal for a galaxy of its luminosity ( skillman et al .",
    "this combination of proximity and normalcy makes ic  1613 one of the best laboratories to study the properties of a dwarf star - forming galaxy that is relatively isolated ( as is typical for i m  v galaxies ) .",
    "the overall structure of ic  1613 also is typical of an i m  v galaxy . while the central field observed by c99 is relatively quiescent , at slightly larger radii ob associations , hii regions and hi shells are found ( e.g. , hodge 1978 ; lake & skillman 1989 ; price , mason , & gullixson 1990 ; georgiev et al .  1999 ; valdez - gutirrez et al .",
    "2001 ) . over the last few years",
    "there have been several papers on the resolved stellar population of ic  1613 based on hst and high quality ground - based observations .",
    "c99 found ic  1613 to be a smoothly evolving galaxy with a relatively constant sfr over its lifetime . a search for bona fide star clusters ( wyder , hodge & cole 2000 ) , of which ic  1613 has a marked lack in comparison with the smc ( baade 1963 ; van den bergh 1979 ) , turned up only one 10  myr old cluster in images taken with the wiyn telescope .",
    "the relative lack of star clusters could be taken as evidence that ic  1613 has been evolving in isolation , free from galaxy - galaxy interactions which may be responsible for triggering most cluster formation ( cf .",
    "van den bergh 2000b ) .",
    "borissova et al .  ( 2000 ) studied the distribution of luminous cool stars from j and k - band imaging obtained with the 2.1-m telescope at the san pedro martir observatory .",
    "they found young supergiants in the central northeast star forming region and agb stars covering a wide range in age in all of their inner galaxy fields .",
    "albert , demers , & kunkel ( 2000 ) surveyed ic  1613 for c and m stars with a wide field camera on the dupont telescope .",
    "this extension of the original cook , aaronson , & norris ( 1986 ) c star survey shows that the old stellar population spreads well beyond the regions where star formation currently is active .",
    "the c / m star ratio is typical for a galaxy of this luminosity ( cf . ,",
    "battinelli & demers 2000 ; demers & battinelli 2002 ) , which can be taken as prima facie evidence against large variations in the sfr at intermediate ages .",
    "variable star investigations have offered an additional dimension to studies of the stellar populations in ic  1613 .",
    "a variety of types of variable stars are seen ( e.g. , mantegazza et al .",
    "2001 ) , including the recent discovery of a luminous mira ( kurtev et al .",
    "this galaxy has a reasonable number of cepheids and has been used to study the period - luminosity relationship ( e.g. , sandage , bell , & tripico 1999 ; antonello , fugazza , & mantegazza 2000 ) .",
    "the presence of a spectrum of pulsating variables extending from long to short periods ( see d01 ) is consistent with star formation having been active in ic  1613 since @xmath1310  gyr in the past .    here",
    "we present a deep color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for an outer field in ic  1613 from long integrations with wfpc2 in the f555w and f814w filters .",
    "we derive the first detailed model of the sfh for this field from cmd model fitting analysis , reaching back to the oldest epochs . because these data consist of such deep integrations , we detect stars further down the main sequence than has previously been possible for an irregular galaxy beyond the magellanic clouds .",
    "these data thus have the quality to allow comparisons between different approaches to cmd analysis . we present three independent derivations of the sfh of our ic  1613 outer field using the techniques of tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) ; dolphin ( 1997 , 2002 ) and cole ( 2003 ; cf .",
    "smecker - hane et al .",
    "these data have been described by d01 , who used the hst single orbit integrations to identify and photometer variable stars such as rr  lyrae and short period cepheids .",
    "as shown in figure  [ footprint ] , an overlay of the wfpc2 footprint on the stsci digitized sky survey , the field center is located 7.4@xmath14 sw from the dynamical center ( lake & skillman 1989 , a projected distance of 1.6 kpc ) and 6.7@xmath14 ( 1.4 kpc ) sw from the `` central '' field studied by c99 .",
    "the position of this field was chosen to minimize crowding and contamination by bright young stars and yet still produce a reasonably large number of stars .",
    "altogether , 8 orbits produced 16 1200s v band ( f555w ) images and 16 orbits produced 32 1200s i band ( f814w ) images .",
    "these images were obtained at four slightly different `` dithered '' positions , and so four deep images were made in each band .",
    "photometry was conducted using the _ multiphot _ routine of hstphot ( dolphin 2000a ) applying the charge transfer loss corrections as described in dolphin ( 2000b ) . in figure  [ cmd ]",
    "we present the final cmd which is very similar in appearance to figure 2 of d01 .",
    "representative photometric error bars are plotted on the left in figure  [ cmd ] and the absolute magnitude scale on the right assumes a distance of 730 kpc as derived by d01 .",
    "the cmd displayed in figure  [ cmd ] , shows a relatively narrow and well defined red giant branch ( rgb ) , a well populated red clump ( rc ) , a faint horizontal branch ( hb ) which extends out from below the rc , and a main sequence ( ms ) that reaches above the rc , but is not nearly as well populated as in more central field of ic 1613 of c99 .",
    "our photometry follows the ms roughly two magnitudes below the hb .",
    "the goal of this program was to reach to the oldest possible ms turn - off populations .",
    "in fact , the data do not reach as deeply as was originally proposed , and the limit of our data is roughly 0.5 magnitudes brighter than our proposed goal ( v @xmath4 27.6 ) .",
    "this difference is likely due to overly optimistic results from the wfpc2 exposure time calculator ( li causi , de marchi , & paresce 2002 ) and not properly accounting for the higher background due to ic  1613 s proximity to the ecliptic ( ecliptic latitude @xmath0 @xmath54.4@xmath15 ) .",
    "the incompleteness , or the likelihood of detecting a star versus its magnitude in our cmd , has been calculated using the precepts laid out in dolphin ( 2002 ) .",
    "this is a critical step which is necessary for the accurate interpretation of a cmd , and results are plotted in figure  [ incom ] .",
    "the 25% and 50% incompleteness limits determined from figure  [ incom ] have been plotted in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "since this is an uncrowded field , the increase in both error and incompleteness at faint magnitudes is primarily due to low s / n , and not crowding ( i.e. , we have not yet hit the confusion limit ) . in figure",
    "[ fake ] we have plotted the error in the recovered magnitude as a function of input magnitudes for the false star tests . the main purpose of figure  [ fake ] is to remind the reader of the rather substantial photometric errors than can occur well before incompleteness becomes significant .    in figure  [ cmd2 ]",
    "we have overplotted theoretical isochrones on top of the cmd shown in figure  [ cmd ] .",
    "the isochrones were calculated for a metallicities of @xmath16 @xmath0 0.001 and 0.004 and ages of 2 , 4 , 10 , and 14 gyr by girardi et al .",
    "the choice of the low metallicity ( 5% of solar ) was driven mostly by the position of the rgb , but the position of the oldest isochrone to the left of the reddest rgb stars indicates that even the oldest stars are slightly more metal rich than this .",
    "however , the positions of the higher metallicity isochrones show that the lower metallicity is a relatively good fit to the rgb stars .",
    "the main reason for overlaying the isochrones here is to demonstrate the coverage and limitations of the observations with respect to the ms turnoffs .",
    "ms turnoffs back to intermediate ages ( @xmath175 gyr ) are well represented in the observations .",
    "however , the oldest ms turnoffs ( @xmath1710 gyr ) fall below the 50% completeness limit , and thus , are not well represented in the observations . as a result , in constructing sfhs , information on the oldest populations will need to come from evolved stars .",
    "in this section and the next we describe an exercise of comparing different modeling techniques in order to determine the sfh of ic  1613 from the present observations .",
    "the interpretation of the derived sfh begins in  5 .",
    "one concern in the field of sfh construction is the uniqueness of the solution ( e.g. , tolstoy & saha 1996 ; aparicio et al .",
    "1996 ; dolphin 1997 ; 2002 ; gallart et al .  1999a ; holtzman et al .  1999 ; hernandez et al .  1999 ; harris & zaritsky 2001 ; skillman & gallart 2003 ) . as higher quality data are obtained and stellar evolution models continue to improve , observational constraints on the derived sfhs become increasingly stringent , and uniqueness becomes less of a problem .",
    "however , as one attempts this type of work at ever increasing distances , one is faced with the challenge of always trying to do more with less . given the relatively high quality of the present dataset , we judged that it would be valuable to conduct three independent sfh derivations . by comparing the results of three independent approaches , we can ascertain which features of the sfhs are technique independent and which are not .",
    "we can also compare the differences between the three results to the sizes of the errorbars and judge the quality of the error assessment in each technique .    here",
    "follow three independent approaches to the analysis of the same observational data .",
    "we present the results from each exercise followed by a comparison of all three . in each section",
    "we only briefly describe each technique ; references to other papers describing the details of the techniques are given .",
    "our aim here is to investigate whether these relatively high quality data drive all three investigations to similar results ( are the results robust ? ) , or if different choices in technique result in significant differences in interpretation ( are the derived sfhs plagued by systematic uncertainties ? ) .",
    "we are not attempting to determine which of the three methods is best .",
    "that debate has both philosophical and technical concerns and is better done with comparisons over a large range in synthetic and real observations . nor are we claiming that if two different methods give similar results that differences in methodology do not matter .",
    "this issue would involve discussions of other methods for deriving sfhs and lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "one way to characterize the three different methods is the degree to which the solution is constrained ( e.g. , by assumptions of certain values or by limitations on the number of variables ) . in the tolstoy method ,",
    "statistical measurements are used to guide choices between prescribed solutions . in the cole method",
    ", a chemical enrichment law is assumed , and the sfr is solved for as a function of time . in the dolphin method , both the metallicity and sfr are solved for as a function of time .",
    "note , however , that there are several other differences including : interpolation of the stellar evolution models in metallicity , allowing for the presence of binary stars , assuming or solving for the distance and/or reddening , etc .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we are _ not _ testing the quality of the stellar evolution models or the suitability of the stellar atmospheres used to calculate the individual star s luminosities and colors .",
    "all three techniques use the same evolution models as their basis , so this can not be tested here .",
    "single age and metallicity samples ( star clusters ) provide more suitable data for testing and tuning of the stellar evolution models ( e.g. , chiosi , bertelli , & bressan 1992 ; carraro et al .",
    "1994 ; bragaglia et al .",
    "2001 ; barmina , girardi , & chiosi 2002 ; and references therein ) .",
    "following updated precepts first laid out in tolstoy ( 1996 ) , tolstoy & saha ( 1996 ) , and tolstoy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , a model has been built up of the sfh of ic  1613 .",
    "the results from stellar evolution codes are used directly as input and there is no interpolation between different metallicity tracks .",
    "also , the photometric data are not binned and the effects of binaries are not directly accounted for .",
    "the present technique is not automated and relies on human judgement to limit the search to various solutions .",
    "using an archive of stellar evolution tracks converted to observables and monte - carlo simulation techniques , a model cmd is built that best matches the observed cmd , and from this a plausible sfh for ic  1613 is inferred .",
    "the padua stellar evolution tracks ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) were used , and then , following tolstoy ( 1996 ) , the temperature and luminosities provided by the padua group were then converted to observed i , v@xmath5i magnitudes using kurucz models ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "this resulted in slightly different observed magnitudes and colors to the padua isochrones , but very similar to the new yonsei - yale isochrones ( yi et al .  2001 ; 2003 ) .",
    "a simple premise is used as a starting point - that of constant star formation at a constant metallicity throughout the history of this galaxy .",
    "successive iterations then investigate where this model fails and what needs to be changed to correct these failings .",
    "note that because the stellar evolution models are not interpolated in metallicity , the degree of failure must be large enough to justify the `` jump '' to the next set of models .    for the young stellar population ,",
    "the best fitting tracks were those of metallicity z=0.004 ( or [ fe / h ] @xmath18 ) , or 20% solar .",
    "this is fairly robust , as the upper part of the cmd ( i@xmath1923.5 ) contains an obvious z=0.004 blue loop population ( rising vertically out of the red clump , i@xmath1923.5 and v@xmath5i@xmath170.8 ) , and not the distinctive lower metallicity blue loop population which would populate a diagonal strip across the cmd from the red clump toward the upper main sequence ( e.g. , sextans a ; dohm - palmer et al .",
    "1997 , 2002 ) .",
    "these stars have ages @xmath201  gyr .",
    "this metallicity is in agreement with the nebular h  ii region oxygen abundances of 12 @xmath2 log(o / h ) @xmath0 7.86 reported by skillman , kennicutt , & hodge ( 1989 ) .",
    "if one assumes constant [ fe / o ] @xmath0 0 , then this is equivalent to [ fe / h]@xmath21 , however , taking the new results of lee et al .",
    "( 2003 ) gives a slightly more metal poor equivalent [ fe / h ] of @xmath51.07 .",
    "this is more metal rich than previous estimates of the metallicity of the old population based on the rgb ( [ fe / h]@xmath22 ) from lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and thus , perhaps indicative of enrichment .",
    "the best understood , most accurate sfr indicator is the main sequence , and this forms the backbone of the constraints on the model .",
    "these data allow us to follow the main sequence down to about 8@xmath59  gyr old turnoff ages , but our sensitivity to all but large variations in the sfrs is very poor @xmath23 6  gyr ago .",
    "there is no evidence for any _ large _",
    "( i.e. , factor of 5 or greater ) variation in the sfr in this field of ic  1613 over the last 6@xmath58  gyr .",
    "we find that the stellar density in the lower part of the cmd ( i=27 , 0.2 @xmath13 v@xmath5i @xmath19 0.8 ) requires an enhancement ( a factor 2@xmath53 ) in the global sfr between 3 and 7 gyr ago . the lower limit of this age range ( 3  gyr ) is determined by the relative lack of any enhancement in stellar density higher up the main sequence , and the upper limit ( 7  gyr ) is determined , arguably somewhat insecurely , by the fact that modeling the sfh thus far has already over - populated the rc and rgb and covered the entire color range of the rgb as well .",
    "a small population older than 7  gyr is required by the small protuberance on the blue side of the rc - this requires a lower metallicity ( z=0.001 ) , old ( @xmath13  10  gyr ) rc .",
    "the presence of an old ( @xmath17 10 gyr ) stellar population is also required by the detection of rr  lyr variable stars in ic  1613 in general ( saha et al .",
    "1992 ) and this field in particular ( d01 ) .",
    "some researchers use the hb as an additional constraint in deriving sfhs , but it is not used here .",
    "the presence and morphology of the hb in the cmd provides very limited insight into the sfh at this epoch due to the second parameter effect ( fusi pecci et al .",
    "1992 ; 1993 ; bellazzini et al .  2001 ;",
    "catelan et al .",
    "2001 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the hb population is certainly a small fraction of the stars in the cmd .",
    "it might be that the slight enhancement in the sfr at @xmath17  1  gyr is due to an over density in the ms due to a blue horizontal branch population .",
    "this was also hypothesized by c99 for the central field of ic  1613 .",
    "the majority of star formation in this field appears to have occurred in the last 5@xmath57  gyr ago , with a peak between 4@xmath56 gyr ago .",
    "if a lower metallicity ( z=0.001 ) is invoked at 6  gyr ago , this would make the peak in the sfr diminish somewhat and bring the sfh closer to a constant rate over time .",
    "additional information is required to select either one of these scenarios .",
    "this is the same dichotomy we found in modeling the pegasus di ( gallagher et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the model cmd which comes out of the above process and best matches the observed cmd is shown in figure  [ etmod ] . this model is the result of the sfh and the variation in metallicity with time shown in figure  [ et ] .",
    "the errors in figure  [ et ] are , as discussed in tolstoy et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , representative error bars that come from the ( large ) sample of models that have been created to find the best match to the sfh of ic  1613 .",
    "they give an indication of how far the sfr in any bin can vary before the fit gets significantly worse .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that a bad fit in one bin can sometimes be compensated by changes in other bins .",
    "thus , the time bins are not independent of each other , and this is quite difficult to account for when determining the errors . note that the errors in figure  [ et ] are only representative of limitations of the models used .",
    "they are not errors calculated from the models or any comparison with the data .",
    "this approach consists of determining the sfh by using a downhill simplex algorithm with simulated annealing to minimize the difference between the observed and synthetic hess diagrams .",
    "the distance , reddening , and age - metallicity relation were held fixed ; the fit parameters were the sfrs in 13 logarithmically - spaced age bins .",
    "a @xmath24 statistic was used to measure the goodness - of - fit of the models .",
    "the full details of the code will be specified in cole ( 2003 ) .",
    "the data were binned by 0.05 mag in ( v@xmath5i ) and 0.1 mag in i to create the hess diagram .",
    "the models were created by using a monte carlo technique to sample from theoretical stellar isochrones of girardi et al .",
    "the isochrones were interpolated to arbitrary combinations of age and metallicity in order to match the data .",
    "artificial star test results were used to simulate the noise and completeness properties of the data , so that a direct comparison could be made .",
    "the stellar imf was taken from kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) , and binary star populations were included following duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) and mazeh et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . under this prescription , 33% of stars are single , 18% are close binaries , and 49% are wide binaries .",
    "close binaries have secondary masses drawn from a flat mass function , while the secondaries of wide binaries are drawn from the kroupa et al.(1993 ) imf . the adopted distance modulus ( m@xmath5m)@xmath25 = 24.31 and reddening e(b@xmath5v ) = 0.02 were taken from the literature ( d01 and references therein ) .",
    "the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) was based on previous work ( see c99 and references therein ) , and iteratively modified based on the colors of the red clump , rgb , and blue loop stars .",
    "the amr can be approximated by a constant value [ fe / h ] = @xmath51.4 for ages older than 10 gyr , increasing linearly with time to [ fe / h ] = @xmath50.7 at the present time .",
    "no dispersion in abundance at a given age is accounted for .",
    "the synthetic cmd that results from this procedure is shown in figure  [ aacsyncmd ] .",
    "the general morphology of the cmd is similar to the observed cmd .",
    "however , the upper two magnitudes of the red giant branch are narrower than the observed rgb , and the synthetic cmd seems to lack upper main - sequence and bright blue loop stars .",
    "these effects are likely attributable to the assumed amr , which does not allow for any abundance dispersion at a given age .",
    "the model also overproduces red horizontal branch stars , which could be a result of inadequacy in the isochrone set .",
    "the overall quality of the fit to the sfh is shown by the differential hess diagram in figure  [ aacdiffcmd ] .",
    "the figure shows the residuals from subtracting the synthetic hess diagram from the data , scaled by the poisson counting statistics in each color - magnitude bin so that white corresponds to a 5@xmath26 excess in the data , and black to a 5@xmath26 excess in the model . in only a few pixels",
    "does the difference exceed 4@xmath26 , most prominently on the horizontal branch and on the blue side of the upper red giant branch . across the diagram , the mean absolute residual is 1.3@xmath26 .",
    "although the isochrones are spaced by 0.05 dex in age , a more informative picture of the sfh is obtained if the age binning is coarser .",
    "age bins 0.2 dex wide were adopted , except for the youngest bin , which extends from 7.80 @xmath20 log ( t / yr ) @xmath20 8.35 . the derived sfh , and the assumed amr , are shown in figure  [ ac ] .",
    "the error bars on the sfh show the 1@xmath26 errors on the sfr in each age bin , considered in isolation .",
    "the derived sfh is in broad agreement with that proposed for the main body by c99 , who suggested roughly constant star - formation over the lifetime of the galaxy , with a decline in the last 0.5 gyr .",
    "our deeper data and more detailed analysis suggest that the sfr began quiescently , increased by a factor of three roughly 5 gyr ago , and has been declining slowly ever since .",
    "nearly half of all stars were formed during the time period from 1.46 gyr ago .",
    "the sfh was determined using the techniques described by dolphin ( 1997 , 2002 ) .",
    "the underlying principle of this approach is to determine the distance , extinction , sfh , and chemical enrichment evolution most likely to produce the observed cmd .",
    "the solution was then derived according to the prescription given by dolphin ( 2002 ) over the cmd section 19.0 @xmath27 v @xmath27 27.0 , 18.0 @xmath27 i @xmath27 26.5 , and @xmath50.5 @xmath27 v@xmath5i @xmath27 3.0 .",
    "the bright limits were set by saturation ; the faint limits were set by where contamination from blended faint stars became significant . throughout the solution , an imf slope of @xmath51.30 , binary fraction of 0.35 , and flat secondary mass function",
    "were assumed .",
    "determination of the age and metallicity resolution of the solution was made by balancing the fit improvement possible with high - resolution solutions with the lower uncertainties given by low - resolution solutions .",
    "the balance was determined by minimizing the  maximum acceptable fit \" ( dolphin 2002 ) , as resolution was varied .",
    "the optimal resolution was determined to be 0.1 dex in both age and metallicity .",
    "the best fit was measured at ( m@xmath5m)@xmath25 @xmath0 24.25 and a@xmath1 @xmath0 0.05 .",
    "fitting the fit parameter as a function of distance and extinction to a surface and using the maximum acceptable fit to determine uncertainties , the minima and uncertainties were measured to be ( m@xmath5m)@xmath25 @xmath0 24.27 @xmath28 0.03 and a@xmath1 @xmath0 0.06 @xmath28 0.03 .",
    "this value of the distance modulus is in excellent agreement with that derived by d01 ( ( m@xmath5m)@xmath25 @xmath0 24.31 @xmath28 0.06 ) .",
    "figure  [ adsyn ] shows a comparison of the observed and synthetic cmds .",
    "the only significant differences are that the red clump is tighter and the rgb broader in the synthetic cmd .",
    "all points in the cmd were fit with @xmath27 3@xmath26 errors , and the overall quality of the best fit was 4@xmath26 from ideal .",
    "this indicates a good , though not perfect , fit .    the largest problem with the fit appears to be the blue helium burning sequence extending vertically up from the red clump .",
    "because the models struggled to fit this feature adequately , it was partially filled in using an extremely metal - poor red giant branch .",
    "one could certainly redo the solution with this part of the cmd omitted , but we do not believe that the recovered sfrs were significantly affected because the total number of rgb stars appears to be correct .",
    "( this is the case because the number of stars on the rgb below the red clump is strongly constrained . ) a second problem , also affecting the rgb , is that the shape of the theoretical rgbs does not exactly match that of the observed data ( see figure 5 ) , thus causing the model rgb to be smeared slightly so that all observed points can be accounted for .",
    "again , the number of rgb stars is constrained by the lower rgb , and the effect on the recovered sfh is minimal .    the sfh and chemical enrichment history were also measured , and are shown in figure  [ ad ] , binned by 0.3 dex in age .",
    "the sfrs are relative values , normalized to a mean value of 1 .",
    "the mean metallicity ( weighted by mass of stars formed , rather than number of stars present today ) was measured to be [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath51.20 @xmath28 0.20 .",
    "error bars are not symmetric , as the best fit ( rather than the average of acceptable fits ) is shown .",
    "uncertainties were measured from two sources : scatter as distance and extinction were moved within the acceptable fit range and scatter as measured from monte carlo tests , in which synthetic populations were created and measured . because of the highly - correlated errors in the sfrs at various ages and metallicities , this composite measurement of uncertainty provides more accurate estimates of the uncertainties of these quantities than does searching around the maximum acceptable fit .",
    "the main feature seen in the sfh is an extended event from @xmath17 2 gyr ago until 5  10 gyr ago .",
    "while there has been star formation since that event ( a significant amount coming 0.5 gyr ago ) , the bulk of the stars in this region of ic 1613 come from the earlier age .",
    "although dolphin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found rr lyraes in this field , the ancient ( @xmath2310 gyr ) sfr was well below the lifetime average .",
    "the metallicity enrichment appears to have been primarily during the extended star formation episode .",
    "older than 10 gyr , we find a mean metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath51.39 @xmath28 0.24 dex ; by 1 gyr ago this had increased to [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath50.63 @xmath28 0.21 .",
    "we see very little enrichment since then , as the average metallicity of all stars younger than 1 gyr is [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath50.77 @xmath28 0.19 .",
    "it should be noted that no assumptions regarding the amr were made in the solution ; metallicities are determined entirely from the populations required to fit the cmd .",
    "figure  [ comp ] shows a direct comparison of the best fit solutions for the sfhs and chemical enrichment histories for ic  1613 derived via the three different methods .",
    "figure  [ comp2 ] shows the same comparison , only with the time axis plotted linearly instead of logarithmically .",
    "we find the agreement between the three methods rather striking and remarkable considering the large differences between the methods .",
    "in particular , all three methods find an enhanced sfr , at roughly the same magnitude ( factor of 3 ) , over roughly the same period ( from 3 to 6 gyr ago ) .",
    "the sfr at early and late times is relatively low , but significantly not zero .",
    "thus , ic  1613 appears to have been creating stars over the entire history of the universe , without very large ( @xmath23 factor of 10 ) variations in sfr ( subject to our time resolution constraints ) .",
    "additionally , all three methods were driven to amrs which are in excellent agreement .",
    "although the solutions do show general agreement , there are clearly differences in the details",
    ". some of the differences may be artificial due to different choices of bin sizes in time .",
    "the most notable difference appears in the last billion years , where the observational time resolution is the greatest ; the tolstoy method finds a relatively lower sfr over the period of 0.2 to 0.6 gyr .",
    "overall , the differences between the models appear to be consistent with the sizes of the estimated errors , suggesting that the internal error estimates are , for the most part , reasonable .",
    "it is important to understand the cmd morphology that drives fitting algorithms , whether manual or automated , to the solutions at which they arrive .",
    "the primary empirical driver of the solutions found here is the large number of stars fainter than i @xmath4 26.3 , with a wide color extent from 0.1 @xmath29 v@xmath5i @xmath29 0.9 .",
    "such large numbers of stars are only produced if the sfr was higher at some point in the past than it is now .",
    "this pedestal represents the main - sequence turnoffs and subgiant branches of the dominant stellar populations in ic  1613 .",
    "it was tentatively detected near the limit of the data in c99 , although crowding made it a low reliability feature .",
    "because of the evolutionary timescales , main - sequence stars must be the primary inhabitants of this region of the cmd , although some contribution of subgiants is present , especially if there is a large old , metal - poor population .",
    "it could be that the color extent of the pedestal is largely responsible for the small differences in ancient sfh derived by the three methods .",
    "this is because of the strong influence of metallicity on the color of the main - sequence for low - mass stars , and to a lesser extent because the presence of unresolved binary stars tends to smear out stellar sequences to the red .",
    "a significant role is also played by the treatment of incompleteness , which can shift stars significantly in the color - magnitude plane . although the differences are small , it is interesting to understand the origins of these differences .    for the tolstoy method ( no interpolation in metallicity between stellar evolution tracks , no binary stars , and an increasing with time but otherwise unrestricted amr ) , a relatively high metallicity ( @xmath16 = 0.004 ) and old age ( 46 gyr ) are necessary to match the red side of the pedestal .",
    "where younger stars are present , they are assumed to be of similar ( or higher ) metallicity  they are brighter , but not much bluer ( see figure  [ etmod ] ) .",
    "this leaves the blue half of the pedestal to be filled in by the unevolved main - sequence of a much younger ( @xmath1710@xmath30 yr ) population .    in the case of isochrone interpolation , binary stars , and an assumed amr ( cole method ) ,",
    "the age of the stars which populate the pedestal is determined by the amr .",
    "because of the contribution of binary stars , the intrinsic sequence that matches the data can be bluer than if no binaries were assumed .",
    "the color is primarily controlled by the metallicity , and so the age follows .",
    "the smearing effect of binary stars and the interpolation in metallicity allow for a more uniform population of the blue half of the pedestal with younger and more metal - rich stars .    in the case where isochrones are interpolated , binary stars",
    "are included , and the amr is explicitly solved for by the automated fitting routine ( dolphin method ) , the code is free to select ages and metallicities that make the best fit to the pedestal .",
    "thus the reddest part of the pedestal is fit by an old , metal - poor population , the middle part is fit by a more metal - rich population at @xmath43 gyr , and the bluest part is matched to a slightly more metal - poor , slightly younger population .",
    "this is the inverse case to the previous one : the color extent of the pedestal determines the amr ( for stars older than @xmath41 gyr ) .",
    "choices propagate through the cmd to rgb color and width , red clump and hb color , magnitude and morphology .",
    "unfortunately , the models are unreliable here ( bertelli & nasi 2001 ; dantona 2002 ; schiavon et al .",
    "2002 ) , so it is difficult to decide how much astrophysical ( as opposed to mathematical ) weight to place on the differences .      in principle , it is possible to derive an amr from the sfh .",
    "is the amr derived in this manner consistent with that derived from directly from the cmd ?",
    "since , in the dolphin solution , the metallicity is a free parameter , and thus , the chemical enrichment law is derived independently of the sfh , it is important to determine if the solution is self - consistent .",
    "that is , has the minimization found a chemical enrichment law which follows naturally from the sfh , or does the solution show chemical enrichment and star formation proceeding in an uncoupled manner ?    in order to derive an amr from the sfh , several assumptions are required .",
    "for example , by integrating the sfh , assuming constant imf and constant yield , using the instant ( or nearly instant ) recycling approximation , it is possible to derive a chemical enrichment law .",
    "some of these assumptions are reasonably constrained , while others are not .",
    "the biggest uncertainty is the history of the gas content of the galaxy",
    ". it would be most convenient to model the evolution of the galaxy as a `` simple closed box '' ( e.g. , searle & sargent 1972 ) , but this model is known to fail for the majority of dwarf irregular galaxies in the sense that either mass inflow or outflow ( or both ) is required ( matteucci & chiosi 1983 ) . however , since we have no independent information concerning the history of the gas content , we assume a simple closed box model evolution in making a comparison calculation . using the present day gas mass of 8.2 @xmath31 10@xmath32 m@xmath33 ( lake & skillman 1989 ) , a stellar mass of 1.0 @xmath31 10@xmath30 m@xmath33 ( based on an assumption of m / l(b ) @xmath0 1.4 from the model calculated in  7.3 ) , and a gas phase oxygen abundance of 6.8 @xmath31 10@xmath34 , results in an oxygen yield of 8.4 @xmath31 10@xmath34 , or 17% of the solar oxygen abundance .",
    "this `` effective yield '' is relatively low when compared to theoretical values of the oxygen yield ( e.g. , maeder 1992 ) , but this is typical of the local group dwarf irregulars ( see discussion in kennicutt & skillman 2001 ) . with this value of the yield",
    ", it is then possible to calculate a chemical enrichment history for a closed box model with the calculated star formation rate as a function of time .    in figure  [ modzfh ]",
    "we have plotted the metal enrichment history of ic  1613 derived from the cmd via the dolphin method and compared it to a metal enrichment history calculated from the sfh derived via the dolphin method assuming a simple closed box model with constant yield . as can be seen in figure  [ modzfh ] ,",
    "the agreement between the two is quite good , with the possible exception of the earliest ages .",
    "this agreement provides another check on the validity of the cmd analysis .",
    "the small difference at the earliest ages is in the sense that the model does not rise quite as quickly as the cmd analysis predicts .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this difference ( if real ) .",
    "certainly our cmd analysis does not provide a strong constraint on the sfr at the earliest epoch , so it could be that there is early star formation that is not found in our solution . for example , we have assumed constant star formation during the interval up to 8 gyr ago ; if we assume a declining sfr during that interval , then the metallicity rises more quickly .",
    "alternatively , it could be that yields are not constant with time or metallicity ( e.g. , there could have been an epoch of prompt early enrichment by a population of stars with an unusual imf ; larson 1998 ) . for comparison ,",
    "we have included in figure  [ modzfh ] the age - metallicity relationship for the smc as derived by pagel & tautvaiien ( 1998 ) , and that measured for the fornax dsph from high resolution spectroscopy of individual stars by tolstoy et al .",
    "note that the enrichment law for the smc appears to fit better in the sense of a steeper rise at early times .",
    "this is a result of assuming inflow ( there is less gas to enrich at early times , so the gas is enriched faster ) .",
    "clearly there are several uncertainties in understanding the nature of the enrichment in these dwarf galaxies .",
    "a significantly deeper cmd and spectroscopic metallicities will be required to better constrain the various possibilities .      despite significant differences in technique between the different modeling approaches , the basic shape of the derived sfh is robust . at the broadest level ,",
    "the sfhs are insensitive to the details of the comparison .",
    "this phenomenon was also seen in the comparison of sfh models for the large magellanic cloud ( skillman & gallart 2003 ) , but is perhaps more surprising for the case of ic  1613 , where there is no clear indication for a distinct main - sequence turnoff , as there is in the lmc .",
    "the impression one gets from this comparison is that all three methods are well constrained by the observations and driven to similar results in calculating the sfhs .",
    "can this result be generalized ?",
    "there are even more methods of deriving sfhs from cmds , so this exercise , by no means , covers the spectrum .",
    "for example , several methods rely on a much coarser binning within the cmd .",
    "additionally , this exercise has only been conducted on one observed cmd",
    ". there could be cmds representing different sfhs where the results of the different methods do depart significantly .",
    "finally , all three methods used the same stellar evolution models as input , so uncertainties in the input models are not being tested . if the models change significantly in the future , then .",
    "of course , one would expect different sfhs as a result .    in sum",
    ", we can conservatively say that this exercise supports the claim ( e.g. , dolphin 2002 ) that high quality cmds ( with the ms sampled down to m@xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath22 or fainter ) will provide sufficient information to place strong constraints on the sfh of a galaxy .",
    "the main goal now is to obtain similarly high quality cmds for other dwarf irregular galaxies and other galaxies sampling different morphological types and environments .",
    "have the deep observations presented here significantly improved our knowledge of the sfh and chemical enrichment of ic  1613 ?",
    "hodge ( 1989 ) provided a sketch of the `` probable '' sfh and amr of ic  1613 , consistent with its known properties , showing a constant sfr and a gradual enrichment of heavy elements .",
    "mateo ( 1998 ) , based on the observations of freedman ( 1988 ) and saha et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , also shows a relatively constant sfr , with a slight decrease at intermediate ages .",
    "the sfh presented by grebel ( 1999 ) , based on freedman ( 1988 ) and cook & aaronson ( 1988 ) is nearly identical to that of mateo , but shows constant metallicity over the entire age of the galaxy .",
    "it would appear that all of the previous sfhs for ic  1613 agree in showing a lack of strong bursts of star formation ( within the limits of the time resolution possible ) .    from a comparative study of the masses , blue luminosities , and h@xmath35 fluxes of a sample of irregular galaxies , gallagher , hunter , & tutukov ( 1984 )",
    "concluded that dwarf irregular galaxies had nearly constant sfrs over their lifetimes .",
    "early studies of the upper portions of the cmds of nearby irregular galaxies supported this conclusion ( e.g. , tosi et al .",
    "the present observations are also consistent with this conclusion . however , the new observations reveal , for the first time , the enhanced sfr over a 3 - 4 gyr period at intermediate ages and give us a first real look at the chemical enrichment in a dirr as a function of time .    we will consider the increase in sfr at intermediate ages relative to the earliest ages to be real .",
    "it is true that , with the present uncertainties , the sfh history of ic  1613 is marginally consistent with constant star formation over the history of the universe .",
    "however , we feel that three independent analyses indicating a heightened sfr at intermediate ages is interesting ( possibly surprising ) and should not be ignored . in  6 we will compare this result with what is seen in other , well studied dwarf galaxies . in  7 we will discuss this within the context of modern theoretical expectations for the evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the chemical enrichment history of ic  1613 is now known in better detail than ever before .",
    "the derived chemical enrichment is in good agreement with that expected for a system showing nearly constant star formation , and is similar to that of other well studied dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have included in figure  [ modzfh ] the age - metallicity relationship for the smc as derived by pagel & tautvaiien ( 1998 ) , and that measured for the fornax dsph from high resolution stellar spectroscopy by tolstoy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . despite the differences in morphologies between the three galaxies ( isolated dwarf irregular , interacting irregular galaxy , and dsph ) , all three galaxies",
    "have very similar amrs .",
    "perhaps this is not too surprising as all three galaxies are apparently dominated by star formation at intermediate ages .",
    "the outer field is 6@xmath367 southwest of the central c99 field , and 8@xmath362 southwest of the geometric center of ic  1613 . at 1.8 kpc projected distance from the center ,",
    "the field is @xmath42.4 scale lengths out in the disk ( hodge et al .",
    "1991 ) , well within the edge of the hi distribution ( lake & skillman 1989 ) .",
    "should we expect a difference in cmd morphology , due to radial gradients in age or metallicity , between the two fields ?",
    "baade noted early on that the blue , irregularly distributed stars in ic  1613 are embedded in a much larger , regular sheet of red stars ; clearly some kind of gradient in stellar population parameters is present .",
    "our outer field is just beyond the `` blue '' limit of ic  1613 as quoted by baade ( 1963 ) , and more than halfway to the edge of the red sheet .",
    "this color difference should be reflected in the cmd morphologies .    to the limiting magnitude achieved here , we are most sensitive to age gradients over the past @xmath37 yr , which will be manifest in the ratio of main - sequence and supergiant stars relative to red giants and red clump stars .",
    "metallicity differences should be reflected in color shifts , following the well known rule of thumb that line blanketing in stellar atmospheres pushes stars to the red at high metallicity .",
    "a direct comparison of the two fields ( e.g. , by a differential hess diagram ) is difficult because of the quite different limiting magnitudes and crowding levels in the images . in figure  [ inout ]",
    "we show the cmd of the outer field ( compare to figure  [ footprint ] ) with fiducial sequences derived from the c99 field overplotted .",
    "solid lines mark the high density features in the cmd : the main - sequence , rgb , red clump , and `` vertical red clump '' ( intermediate - mass blue loop stars ) .",
    "dashed lines delineate the less populous features : horizontal branch , blue and red supergiants , and thermally - pulsing agb .",
    "there are no significant color differences between the principal sequences of figure  [ inout ] .",
    "below i @xmath425 , both the rgb and the ms fiducials of the c99 field appear to deviate from the outer field sequences .",
    "however , the differences are small and in opposite directions ; they are interpreted as due to the larger errors and increased crowding in the c99 data .",
    "the agreement between upper rgbs is striking : if any metallicity gradient is present , a finely - tuned age gradient must be invoked to cancel out the effect .",
    "it is unlikely that the dominant population in the c99 field is very much younger than the outer field , given 1 ) the relatively young age of most stars in the outer field ( figure  [ comp2 ] ) , and 2 ) the approximately steady - state history derived by c99 for the central field .",
    "the similar colors of the intermediate - age and old stellar populations in both fields suggests that they are not very different from each other , at least over most of their history .",
    "further support for this view derives from the near constancy with radius of the carbon : m - star ratio ( albert , demers , & kunkel 2000 ) , indicating a comparable proportion of intermediate - age stars at both small and large radii .",
    "the relative strengths of the various features , however , vary significantly between the two fields .",
    "table 1 lists the relative numbers of stars in various evolutionary phases ; the uncertainties in the ratios are derived from poisson statistics on the number counts .",
    "the difference in surface brightnesses in photographic @xmath38 band is taken from hodge et al .",
    "( 1991 ) as 2.4@xmath280.5 mag arcsec@xmath39 , or a factor of 9@xmath283 in flux . because photographic @xmath38 is blue - sensitive , it is not surprising that the unresolved @xmath38-light is most closely tracked by the bluest resolved stars .",
    "there is a clear difference in number density ratios between the young stars and the old stars .",
    "the available information suggests that as the global activity level in ic  1613 declined after the broad peak @xmath17 27  gyr ago , the star - formation rate in the central regions stayed high longer , and has maintained an average level some 3040% higher than the outer field .",
    "star formation remains much higher still in the off - center complex of hii regions that coincides with the peak of the hi column density ( lake & skillman 1989 ) . in the outer field ,",
    "star formation has slowed but not stopped , as attested by the presence of a few small hii regions even at this radius ( hodge , lee , & gurwell 1990 ) .",
    "although detailed sfh studies exist for other dwarf irregular galaxies , no dwarf irregular galaxies at distances beyond the magellanic clouds have been observed to the depth of the present study of ic  1613 ( m@xmath1 @xmath40 @xmath23.4 ) .",
    "dolphin ( 2002 ) has shown that the cmd needs to be sampled down to at least m@xmath1 @xmath0 @xmath22 for meaningful constraints on the ancient and intermediate age sfh , and most studies of dwarf irregular galaxies fall short of this .",

    "do the similar sfhs and amrs for ic  1613 and leo  i support the proposal by lin & faber ( 1983 ) that dsphs can be formed by ram pressure stripping of dirrs ? at the time , lin & faber estimated that an ambient number density of 10@xmath42 @xmath43 would be required for stripping the gas from a dirr over a hubble time and inferred the presence of such gas through indirect arguments . recently ,",

    "originally discussed within the context of explaining the absorbers responsible for the ly-@xmath35 forest ( ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ) , later papers realized the potentially important effects of early heating of the ism on the evolution of dwarf galaxies ( efstathiou 1992 ; babul & rees 1992 ; chiba & nath 1994 ; quinn , katz , & efstathiou 1996 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; kepner , babul , & spergel 1997 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ; bullock et al .",

    "after reionization , the high uv background prevented further infall and kept the gas within ic  1613 from cooling rapidly , so that it never formed too many stars until star formation in m31 and the milky way settled down enough to drop the uv background , at a redshift roughly between 1 and 2 .",
    "it then took some time for that gas to cool , until finally at z @xmath4 0.5 the star - formation ramped up to a peak and slowly declined later .",
    "this is not `` delayed galaxy formation , '' as we do see evidence for very old stars in ic  1613 ( e.g. , rr lyrae stars ) , but formation of a dwarf in which much of the star formation was deferred .    within the collapse and dissipation model of galaxy formation ( white & rees 1978 ) , the effects of reionization on the evolution of dwarf galaxies is twofold ( see discussion in benson et al .",

( 2002a ) point out that the formation history is also an important parameter in determining the final gas content of a dark matter halo . in order to solve the perceived problem of the mismatch between the theoretically expected and observed low end of the galaxy luminosity function ,",

    "however , these studies generally concentrate on the luminosity function and star formation histories of individual galaxies are not explored in depth .",
    "the second effect is relevant to the question of suppressed star formation at intermediate ages .",
    "can star formation in dwarf galaxies which have already formed before reionization be suppressed by the photoionizing background and then recommence at redshifts of 0.5 and lower ?",

    "however , it is interesting that the bulk of the star formation in ic  1613 occurs at intermediate ages , which may well be after much of the gas in the central parts of the galaxy has had time to recombine and cool .",

    "<S> we have taken deep images of an outlying field in the local group dwarf irregular galaxy ic  1613 with the wfpc2 aboard the hubble space telescope in the standard broad - band f555w ( v , 8  orbits ) and f814w ( i , 16  orbits ) filters . </S>",

    "<S> we analyze the resulting color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and compare it with cmds created from theoretical stellar models using three different methods to derive a star formation history ( sfh ) as well as constrain the chemical evolution for ic  1613 . </S>",
    "<S> all three methods find an enhanced star formation rate ( sfr ) , at roughly the same magnitude ( factor of 3 ) , over roughly the same period ( from 3 to 6 gyr ago ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , all three methods were driven to similar age - metallicity relationships ( amr ) which show an increase from [ fe / h ] @xmath4 @xmath51.3 at earliest times to [ fe / h ] @xmath4 @xmath50.7 at present . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is found between the amr which is derived from the cmd analysis and that which can be inferred from the derived sfh at all but the earliest ages . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the three models and the self - consistency of the derived chemical enrichment history support the reality of the derived sfh of ic  1613 and , more generally , are supportive of the practice of constructing galaxy sfhs from cmds .    </S>",
