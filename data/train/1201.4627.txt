    ", the critical collapse is induced by the quintic nonlinearity , which gives rise to the known 1d counterparts of the townes solitons , see eq .",

    "the analogy to the 2d setting suggests a possibility of the stabilization of the 1d variety of townes solitons by means of the single - well or lattice potentials , which was demonstrated in refs .",
    "sharp - soliton and @xcite , respectively , with the help of numerical simulations and a variational approximation ( va ) . as concerns physical realizations , the quintic nonlinearity ( acting , generally , in a combination with the cubic term )",
    "was theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally observed in diverse optical media , including liquids liquids , colloid , glasses @xcite and ferroelectric films @xcite .",
    "generally , this nonlinearity comes along with the cubic losses .",
    "nevertheless , the losses may be usually neglected over relatively short propagation distances for which experiments are run . in particular , the cubic - quintic ( cq , alias @xmath2 ) optical nonlinearity",
    "may be efficiently adjusted in colloids formed of metallic nanoparticles , by selecting the size of the particles and the colloidal filling factor @xcite .",
    "using these parameters , one may emulate a medium with the quintic - only nonlinearity , i.e. , @xmath3 , which is the case especially interesting for the theoretical consideration , see below .",
    "another realization of an effectively quintic medium may be possible in a composite material built as an alternation of narrow self - focusing and defocusing layers @xcite , in which the cubic @xmath0 coefficient is canceled on the average , while its @xmath1 coefficient remains uncompensated .    in terms of the bec ,",
    "the quintic term in the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) may represent three - body interactions in a sufficiently dense condensate , provided that the lossy part of these interactions may be neglected ( the latter depends on particular properties of the condensate , the use of the feshbach resonance for controlling the scattering length of inter - atomic collisions , etc . ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a universal quintic term appears in the effective gpe , in the absence of any three - body interactions , as a result of the reduction of the dimension from 3 to 1 under the action of the strong confinement in the transverse plane @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "no dissipative nonlinearity appears , and the sign of the effective quintic term is self - attractive , irrespective of the sign of the scattering length which determines the self - attractive or repulsive sign of the cubic nonlinearity . the relative strength of the respective quintic term in comparison to the basic cubic one can be estimated as @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath5 is the scattering length ( @xmath6 corresponds to the attraction between atoms ) , and @xmath7 the 1d density of the condensate . for the typical situation with matter - wave solitons containing @xmath8 atoms in the area of size @xmath9 @xmath10 m , with @xmath11 nm @xcite ,",
    "the estimate yields the value @xmath12 , hence the quintic terms may be as important as the cubic one .",
    "more recently , the studies of the soliton dynamics in periodic potentials were extended for _ nonlinear lattices _ ( nls ) , which are represented by _ pseudopotentials _",
    "@xcite induced by spatially periodic modulations of the local strength of  the nonlinearity , see original works @xcite-@xcite and recent review @xcite . in optics and bec ,",
    "nls may be engineered by means of various techniques , such as filling voids of photonic crystals with properly selected materials , or using the feshbach resonance controlled by spatially patterned fields @xcite ( in particular , _ magnetic lattices _ governing the local strength of the feshbach resonance have been built using sets of ferromagnetic films ferro ) . in quasi-1d becs",
    ", an nl can also be induced by periodically modulating the transverse - confinement strength in the axial direction luca .",
    "similarly , a periodic modulation of the local nonlinearity strength in a planar optical waveguide may be created by varying the thickness of the waveguiding layer .",
    "in particular , the periodically modulated quintic - only and cq nonlinearities , considered below , may be realized in the above - mentioned colloid layers with the periodic variation of the transverse thickness , or  by applying a properly patterned magnetic field to the colloidal suspension formed by ferromagnetic particles .",
    "the previous analysis has demonstrated that nls readily support stable 1d solitons , but it is quite difficult , although possible , to stabilize 2d solitons against the critical collapse by means of nonlinear ( pseudo)potentials . namely , 2d sinusoidal lattices completely fail to provide for the stabilization , while shapes with _ sharp edges _ , such as circles or stripes , are able to do it @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although a periodic lattice of nonlinear circles with sharp edges can support stable 2d solitons , they are virtually the same as those supported by a lone circle , i.e. , the periodicity plays no essential role in the stabilization vyslo .",
    "the results outlined above suggest to investigate the 1d counterpart of the problem , i.e. , stabilization of 1d solitons by means of nls against the respective critical collapse , accounted for by the @xmath1 ( quintic - only ) or cq nonlinearity .",
    "below , we perform the analysis of the model with the quintic - only and cq self - focusing terms , whose strength is subject to the periodic spatial modulation , by means of numerical methods and analytical approximations .",
    "we find that a smooth sinusoidal @xmath1 nl can stabilize 1d solitons , on the contrary to the negative result in 2d , but only in a narrow parametric region .",
    "this finding is explained with the help of an analytical approach .",
    "the sinusoidal cq nl gives rise to a much broader stability area than its quintic counterpart , which is demonstrated by means of the va , in addition to numerical results .",
    "a chain of nonlinear domains with sharp edges may support stable solitons in 1d as well , but it can be readily checked that , like their 2d counterparts , such solitons are actually supported by lone nonlinear islands , the effect of the periodicity being negligible .",
    "in terms of optical realizations , the scaled form of the underlying nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) for the field amplitude , @xmath13 , is @xmath14 |u|^{2}u-[g_{0}+g_{1}\\cos ( 2x)]|u|^{4}u ,   \\label{gpe}\\]]where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are strengths of the uniform cq terms , @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the nl , and the scale of coordinate @xmath19 is fixed by setting the nl period to be @xmath20 .",

    "the narrow stability stripe in the quintic model , and its absence in the recently studied 2d models with sinusoidal nls acting on the cubic nonlinearity ( which is critical in the 2d geometry ) were also qualitatively explained by means of an analytical approximation .",
