    "comparison of dynamical and photometrical mass determinations in galaxies like our own strongly indicates the existence of a non - luminous dark matter component , that accounts for most of the mass in these galaxies .",
    "the constancy of @xmath7-rotation curves even far beyond the optical edge of galactic disks furthermore indicates a @xmath8-density distribution of this dark component ( rubin  et .",
    "al .  1982 , 1985 ) .",
    "thus one question naturally arises : what is the nature of this dark component ?",
    "a whole variety of dark matter candidates have been proposed in the literature , ranging from light leptonic particles to baryonic gaseous matter ( possibly in the form of cold molecular clouds with fractal structure ; pfenninger  et .",
    "1994a , b ) to low mass stars such as white dwarfs or `` jupiters '' and finally black holes with masses @xmath9 as remnants of a population of very massive primordial stars ( for a brief overview see e.g. chap .  18 in peebles  1993 and references therein ) .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    the latter are of theoretical interest , since the jeans mass at high red shift ( just after the epoch of recombination ) was of the order of @xmath10 ( dicke  &  peebles  1968 ) and black holes with this mass could very effectively heat an initially cold disk in our galaxy explaining the observed properties ( lacey  &  ostriker  1985 ) .",
    "but there also are many arguments against massive black holes as main constituents of the galactic dark halo .",
    "hut  &  rees ( 1992 ) argued that black holes with @xmath11 in the inner few kiloparsecs would sink into the galactic center within a fraction of the hubble time due to dynamical friction .",
    "this process would lead to consequences that strongly disagree with observations .",
    "furthermore massive black holes would on passages through the galactic disk accrete interstellar matter and thus violate background light constraints ( carr  1979 ) . and massive black holes would finally cause gravitational lensing of cosmologically distant sources .",
    "garrett  et  al .  ( 1994 ) studied this effect on @xmath12 vlbi maps of the gravitational lens system @xmath13 and conclude that black holes with @xmath14 can not account for the dark matter in the halo of the main lensing galaxy .",
    "rix  &  lake ( 1993 ) again applied the disk heating scenario to dwarf galaxies of the local group and derived an upper limit of @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "carr , bond & arnett ( 1984 ) derived a strong lower limit of @xmath16 by examining the possible cosmological consequences of population  iii  stars .",
    "their black hole remnants must exceed this limit , otherwise the enrichment of the interstellar medium would be too pronounced .",
    "this paper facilitates a different approach : it uses the fragility of globular clusters in our galaxy to constrain . adopting the hypothesis that the dark halo consists entirely of massive black holes , globular clusters are subject to constant bombardment of these objects on their orbits through the milky way .",
    "the observed properties of globular clusters thus set strong limits on the mass distribution of these black holes .",
    "to calculate the response of globular clusters to encounters with massive black holes we use a modification of the impulsive approximation ( spitzer  1958 ) and test this analytical approach by direct n - body simulations of such an event .",
    "the excellent agreement of both methods shows the validity of the assumptions of the analytical approach and allows us to study a large region in parameter space since this method consumes much less computer time .",
    "we obtain analytical values for the average internal energy gain of globular clusters due to the interaction with halo objects in the milky way .",
    "since this energy gain is mostly determined by only few central encounters , the scatter around its mean value is very large . to account for that scatter and to be able to make statistically sound predictions , we adopt ten model clusters and compute for every one of them @xmath3 encounter histories each at three different galactocentric radii ( @xmath17 , @xmath4 and @xmath18 ) and for a black hole mass range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , applying monte carlo methods .",
    "if the increase of internal kinetic energy of the system exceeds its binding energy , we assume it dissolves .",
    "thus we obtain the fraction of globular clusters , which would survive for @xmath19 years , depending on internal parameters , such as concentration and total mass , their galactocentric distance and the assumed black hole mass . comparing that data with observations",
    "we constrain the maximum black hole mass to @xmath20 .",
    "this value agrees with the mass range obtained by other authors using a variety of methods .",
    "it especially has to be compared with the numbers calculated by moore  ( 1993 ) .",
    "he used similar arguments than this paper applies , but did not take the huge spread in internal energy gain for different encounter histories into account .",
    "he calculated for nine different globular clusters in the outer galactic halo one encounter history each .",
    "therefore his estimate is highly uncertain .",
    "taking into account different encounter histories of individual globular clusters , the present work stands statistically on more solid ground than previous work , leading to a more precise estimate for the maximal allowed mass of compact dark halo objects .",
    "galactic globular clusters can very well be fitted by a king density profile ( king  1966 , illingworth  &  illingworth  1976 ) .",
    "king models are lowered nonsingular isothermal spheres , which are generated from the distribution function of an isothermal sphere by introducing an energy cut - off .",
    "this results in a radial cut - off at the tidal radius @xmath21 .",
    "king models form a sequence that can be parametrized by the concentration index @xmath22 .",

    "we therefore have performed n - body calculations of encounters with @xmath198 , which indicate that the mass loss during such an event is so severe , that the cluster either dissolves instantaneously or the remaining ( bound ) stars relax back into an equilibrium state that is much less viable and will get disrupted within a few @xmath199 years .",
    "clusters that suffered a central encounter with @xmath200 were always destroyed .",
    "an event with @xmath201 typically causes the cluster to loose @xmath202 of its stars .",
    "the energy input in a central encounter is not distributed evenly onto the cluster stars , but affects those most that are located along the trajectory of the black hole through the cluster .",
    "@xmath203 of the stars remain bound and form a new globular cluster like configuration within a few relaxation time scales @xmath204 .",
    "the binding energy of this `` new '' cluster however is much smaller than that of the original one by a factor of five",
    ". therefore the next encounter of similar strength ( or several more distant encounters with the same cumulative energy input ) will easily disrupt the cluster .",
    "after all , it is save to take the value @xmath205 as an adequate upper limit to cluster survival .",
    "the simulations also indicate that a series of distant ( and therefore weak ) encounters integrated over a certain period @xmath183 have a more serious effect on a globular cluster than one single central encounter at the beginning of this time interval @xmath183 leading to the same net energy input . in the first case ,",
    "the excess energy is more or less evenly distributed onto the cluster stars thus leading to a high evaporation rate throughout the whole studied time interval .",
    "whereas in the case of a central collision , some stars ( alongside the trajectory of the black hole through the cluster ) gain very high velocities and immediately leave the cluster taking away a large fraction of the energy input .",
    "the remaining stars stay kinematically colder and can  when the impact was not completely devastating in the first place ",
    "relax back into equilibrium , then again exhibiting the small mass loss rate of unperturbed dynamical evolution .",
    "the exemplary case , standard cluster at @xmath206 with black holes of @xmath207 , reveals a extremely low rate of survivors within the inner @xmath208 of the milky way ( fig .",
    "[ wilder - aff ] ) .",
    "this analysis is extended to all models and to different black hole masses in the next section .",
    "= 15.5 cm    = 15.5 cm    = 15.5 cm",
    "determinations of the total mass in the luminous halo of our galaxy lead to a value around @xmath209 ( carney  et .  al .  1991 ; or e.g. @xmath210 in the range @xmath211  @xmath212 in suntzeff  et .",
    "al .  1990 ) . with a total mass of around @xmath213 in ( halo )",
    "globular clusters out to @xmath214 ( carney  et .",
    "al .  1991 ) , the cluster to halo mass ratio is 0.015  0.02 .",
    "the maximum allowed cluster disruption rate is obtained , assuming that all halo field stars are the debris of dissolved galactic globular clusters , implying that the galactic globular cluster system was about a factor of 100 more massive when it formed more then @xmath19 years ago than it is today . neglecting the evolutionary differences of globular clusters of different masses and concentrations , the above ratio sets a very conservative lower limit to the survival rate of these clusters , which further can be used to obtain an upper limit on the mass of dark halo black holes :",
    "if the assumption of a certain black hole mass leads to a survival rate below @xmath215 , then this mass has to be discarded . with the method described in the last section we calculate for each of the ten globular cluster models the fraction of survivors for black hole masses in the range @xmath216 to @xmath217 at three galactocentric radii , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the result of these computations is plotted in fig.s  [ plot - lifenum - mass - all - i ] , [ plot - lifenum - mass - all - ii],[plot - lifenum - mass - all - iii ] .",
    "the dashed line indicates the acceptance threshold at @xmath215 .",
    "these figures exhibit the following trends in our model :    1 .",
    "closer to the galactic center the number density of dark halo objects increases and so does the number of encounters .",
    "thus the range where the number of surviving globular clusters drops to zero shifts to lower black hole masses .",
    "2 .   within one sequence of equal concentration ,",
    "the more massive clusters are more viable .",
    "this is understandable , because the bigger the cluster is , the tighter it is bound at fixed concentration ( i.e. the deeper is its own potential well ) and the better can it resist the steady bombardment of background particles .",
    "3 .   since @xmath221 and also @xmath222 ( according to equation  [ umpf_umpf ] ) ,",
    "the stability of the cluster increases with growing central density or dispersion .",
    "quite unexpectedly , we find that the most stringent constraints come from the most centrally concentrated clusters # 9 and # 0 to # 3 .",
    "the larger @xmath33 , the more extended is the envelope of less strongly bound stars outside the core and thus the geometrical cross section of the cluster . with an extended outer region",
    "a cluster can more effectively loose stars than a less centrally concentrated and thus smaller one . variations of the concentration index @xmath33 have the largest effect on the survival rate of the model clusters .",
    "it even outweighs the influence of the cluster mass , as can be seen in sequence # 4 , # 8 and # 9 : the threshold of 1% survivors is reached for cluster # 9 first , even though it has the highest mass in that sequence .",
    "the above results have to be compared with the observation : the upper limits for black hole masses at @xmath223 for the ten model clusters are the strictest constraints . since our model clusters all have central densities around @xmath224 and the central density is directly proportional to the total mass and thus to the depth of the potential well of the cluster it influences the binding energy of the cluster and its stability .",
    "one therefore has to compare the model clusters with galactic globular clusters in the same density range ( @xmath225  @xmath226 ) , in order to obtain meaningful results .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ final - limit ] .",
    "analogous to fig.[fig - conc - mass ] , it shows our ten model clusters ( shaded circles ) and the @xmath227 ",
    "@xmath33 distribution of the galactic globulars in the appropriate density range .",
    "the four thick gray lines confine the region of too low cluster survival rate .",
    "globular clusters with masses @xmath227 and concentrations @xmath33 to the left of these lines have a probability of less than 1% ( @xmath228 ) to survive for @xmath19 years in a galactic dark halo consisting of black holes with masses @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "these values are obtained from the calculations at @xmath233 , since these give the strongest constraints for the maximum allowed black hole masses .",
    "hence we have to compare them with the globular clusters at @xmath234 .",
    "one sees that all these clusters fall beyond the line @xmath235 .",
    "therefore @xmath236 is an upper limit to the mass of compact dark halo objects .",
    "this limit is more than an order of magnitude lower than the value @xmath237 derived by lacey  &  ostriker  ( 1985 ) in order to explain the disk heating process , that possibly led to the thick disk component in our galaxy .",
    "thick disk formation by heating due to black holes hence can be ruled out .",
    "= 15.5 cm    in our examination we concentrate on _ one _ single effect of galactic environment on the evolution of globular clusters , the influence of massive compact objects building the dark halo of our milky way .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to include further aspects of the dynamical evolution of galactic globular clusters , such as disk shocking , influence of the galactic bulge or loss of angular momentum of globular cluster orbits due to dynamical friction , driving them closer to the galactic center .",
    "also the role of binaries and mass segregation in the internal evolution of star clusters are not considered .",
    "whereas the latter two are negligible for our study , the first two can be of importance especially in the inner regions of the milky way . neglecting these corrosive effects",
    "when comparing our model with observed properties of the galactic population , leads to a somewhat too large upper mass limit for the black holes .",
    "thus , a more realistic constraint on compact dark halo objects may lie below the values derived here .",
    "concerning globular cluster trajectories , we assume for simplicity that they are moving on circular orbits . to examine the influence of this ansatz",
    ", we determine the number of encounters with compact background objects for globular clusters on orbits with different ellipticities in the galactic potential , using the dark matter distribution ( equation  [ hallali ] ) derived in sect .",
    "[ discussion - i ] .",
    "the number @xmath125 of encounters within a certain time interval @xmath121 is @xmath238 , with @xmath170 being the collision cross section and @xmath169 being the number density of background objects . calculating @xmath125 for orbits with the same average distance @xmath118 to the galactic center , i.e. the _ time _ average of @xmath118 is kept fixed , but ellipticities ranging from zero to one , from circular to radial orbits , we see only a moderate increase of the encounter rate by a factor of two .",
    "this effect gets stronger in a more centrally concentrated dark matter distribution than adopted in equation  ( [ hallali ] ) and vanishes in a homogeneous distribution .",
    "we conclude , that using circular orbits only slightly underestimates the collision rate and thus only slightly increases the mass limit for black holes in the galactic dark halo .",
    "let us now relax the stringent threshold of @xmath215 , adopting for example a value of @xmath239 , i.e. if we require 50% of the initial clusters to survive .",
    "we then get a maximum permitted black hole mass which is by a factor of about 5 smaller than before , thus pushing that value down to @xmath240 .",
    "since it is very unlikely , that the halo field stars stem all from disrupted globular clusters and one can envision many other and more reasonable formation scenarios , like an intrinsic population of halo stars or debris from accreted satellite galaxies , the maximum number of disrupted clusters is more likely in the range of a few tenth of per cent .",
    "then the method applied in this paper leads to an upper limit on @xmath241 of @xmath240 .",
    "this number has to be compared with limits on @xmath241 derived by other authors .",
    "moore ( 1993 ) obtained values which are lower by about one magnitude . he quasi - analytically computed the disruption time scale as a function of black hole mass for nine halo globular clusters in our milky way . describing the cluster by a smooth density profile and thus neglecting the initial velocity dispersion of the cluster stars , he calculated the energy input per encounter .",
    "he then summed up encounters with randomly distributed impact parameters and velocities until the total energy input is equal to the binding energy .",
    "the required time interval defines his disruption time @xmath242 . by adjusting the black hole mass",
    ", he fixed @xmath242 for each particular cluster to be roughly half the typical age of a globular cluster in the galaxy or about half the hubble time : @xmath243years .",
    "thus he used only _",
    "one _ encounter history to obtain his upper limit on @xmath241 for each cluster .",
    "since each encounter history is dominated by only a few central impacts the scatter between different encounter histories is huge ( see fig .",
    "[ wilder - aff ] ) and moores numbers are plagued by error bars of at least one order of magnitude .",
    "we therefore conclude , that his value of @xmath244 is still questionable .",
    "a different approach was taken by rix  &  lake  ( 1993 ) .",
    "they followed the original considerations of lacey  &  ostriker  ( 1985 ) about the effects of massive dark halo objects on galactic disks , applying them to two nearby dwarf galaxies dominated by an extended dark halo : ddo  154 and gr  8 .",
    "ddo  154 ( similar to ddo  170 , lake  et  al .",
    "1990 ) results in @xmath245 and gr  8 in @xmath246 .",
    "the fact that globular cluster with masses in the range @xmath247 and concentrations as high as @xmath248 have survived for the past @xmath19 years provides strong constraints on the masses of black holes as possible candidates for the dark matter in our galaxy .",
    "as globular clusters represent only a small subpopulation of the galactic halo , a large fraction of them could indeed have been disrupted by encounters with massive black holes forming the field star population of the halo , with only a few lucky candidates being left behind .",
    "we have calculated the survival probabilities for different model clusters in the milky way assuming a dark halo consisting entirely of massive black holes and demonstrated that these probabilities strongly vary for individual encounter histories .",
    "in contrast to former models , we therefore propose that detailed monte - carlo simulations are required in order to determine the maximum allowed black hole masses .",
    "our calculations lead to an upper mass limit of @xmath249 , which is somewhat larger than former estimates but on the other hand small compared to the black hole masses required to explain the formation of the thick disk as the result of dynamical heating by these massive objects .",
    "the calculations can not rule out massive black holes completely .",
    "indeed , black holes with masses of @xmath250 could in principle explain the observed upper concentration limit ( @xmath251 ) of globular clusters as more concentrated objects would be disrupted .",
    "this possibility however is still unlikely given the fact that observations in dwarf galaxies indicate even smaller upper mass limits ."
