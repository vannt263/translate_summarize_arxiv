    "it is known @xcite , that if the potential energy satisfies the laplace equation , the small - angle scattering is closely related to conformal mapping on a complex plane .",
    "this makes it possible to introduce complex variables in the impact - parameter plane @xmath1 and in the momentum - transfer plane @xmath2 , which leads to a remarkable simplification of the calculations . besides the simplification for harmonic scatterers , it is possible to formulate certain rigorous theorems that permit to estimate the classical scattering at small and large momentum transfers , as well as to elucidate the nature of the singularities in the differential effective cross section .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the method of conformal scattering @xcite to the case of scattering processes involving magnetic monopoles ( dyons ) and ordinary charges .",
    "the hypothesis of a new particle , the magnetic monopole , has been introduced by dirac @xcite in 1931 .",
    "such a particle , for which there is no experimental evidence would be a source of coulomb - like magnetic field .",
    "dirac argued that in order to fit into conventional quantum mechanics , the neu particle must satisfy a quantization condition : eg = n/2 [ quantcond ] where @xmath3 is the charge of the monopole , @xmath4 is the electric charge of any other particle , and @xmath5 is some integer . due to the quantization condition",
    "a perturbative treatment of the scattering processes involving magnetic monopoles and usual charges is doubtful if at all possible . in this situation one",
    "looks for methods of calculating the scattering amplitude which although approximate , are nonperturbative",
    ".    the eikonal approximation @xcite for small angle scattering of fast particles not only makes it possible to express the scattering amplitude as an integral , but also preserves many important properties of the exact solution . for example , it preserves the unitarity relation , which is violated by e.g. the born approximation . in limiting cases the eikonal approximation reduces to the born or classical approximations for small - angle scattering .",
    "the small - angle scattering problem simplifies significantly in the case of harmonic scatterers ( i.e. when the potential energy satisfies the laplace equation ) due to the analyticity of complex impact - parametr plane mapping to momentum - transfer plane @xcite .",
    "after the complex variables , namely the impact parameter @xmath6 and the momentum transfer @xmath7 , are introduced the integrations in the eikonal formula can be separated and therefore the scattering amplitude factorizes , i.e. , it can be expressed as a sum each term of which is the product of two functions depending on @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "thus the scattering amplitude can be expressed through contour integrals , what is very convenient for both general studies and numerical calculations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we formulate the method of conformal scattering for processes involving magnetic and electric charges .",
    "we show that the description of small - angle scattering processes on a system of electric and magnetic charges can be simplified by introducing the complex charge planes ( the electric charge corresponds to the real part and the magnetic charge to the imaginary part ) .",
    "this implies that the amplitudes for scattering on various configurations of electric and magnetic charges are related by analytical continuation of the amplitudes in the complex charge plane . in section 3 the quantum mechanical generalization of the method of conformal scattering",
    "is considered . using this method",
    "we examine in details scattering on a dyon and two monopoles located at different points . for the first time we obtain explicit expressions for the eikonal amplitude for all these problems in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions and bessel functions of various types for all these problems .    in section 4 we investigate the focal points , where the classical scattering amplitude becomes infinite , which play an important role in the general theory of diffraction and in catastrophe theory .",
    "to begin with , let us consider according to @xcite the classical small - angles scattering of particles by nonspherically symmetrical scatterer with potential energy @xmath9 in the presence of an external magnetic field with potential @xmath10 .",
    "it can be regarded as a one - to - one single - valued mapping of the impact - parameter plane @xmath11 into the transverse momentum - transfer plane @xmath12 , given by @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath4 and @xmath15 are the charge and the momentum of the incident particle , and @xmath16 as @xmath17 has been assumed .",
    "the differential effective small - angle cross section is defined as the jacobian of the transformation @xmath18 @xmath19 where the summation is over all the values of the multiply valued function @xmath20 ( it can be `` zero - valued '' for certain @xmath21 ) . in other words ,",
    "the effective cross section is defined as the ratio of the area elements in the plane @xmath6 and the corresponding area elements in the plane @xmath21 .    in the general case , a small circular area in the @xmath6 plane",
    "is mapped onto an elliptic area in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "the line along which the minor semi - axis of this ellipses vanishes is called the rainbow line ( then the major semi - axes are the tangents of the rainbow line ) .",
    "the mapping of the rainbow lines on the impact - parameter plane is defined by the equation ( p_x , p_y)/(x , y ) = 0 .",
    "[ mapping ] for a spherically symmetrical potential the scattering is axisymmetric and the rainbow lines are circles in the impact - parameter plane and in the momentum - transfer plane with the center at the origin . if the potential @xmath22 is a harmonic function , i.e. , it satisfies the two - dimensional laplace equation @xmath23 then rainbow lines degenerate into points ( the so called focal points ) , since equation being supplemented by @xmath24 takes the form : @xmath25 hence instead of one condition that defines the rainbow line on a plane , we obtain thus two conditions that define in the general case only points on the impact - parameter plane and on the momentum - transfer plane ( focal points ) .",
    "it is convinient to introduce complex impact parameter and complex transverse momentum @xmath26 as well as a complex potential analytical function , such that @xmath27 .",
    "we then obtain the following formulas for the momentum transfer , the focal point , and the effective cross section p^*=-p^-1_0 , = 0 , = p^2_0||^2 , [ classical ] where the summation is over all the values of the multiply valued function @xmath28 .",

    "we see that introducing magnetic charges into a system corresponds to continuation of the charges into a complex plane , this fact reduces the problem of scattering on a system involving magnetic charges to the corresponding problem with only electric charges by analytical continuation in the complex charge plane .",
    "it is also worth noting that the imaginary part of the complex charges is proportional to the momentum of the incident particle .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that passing from variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 to @xmath6 and @xmath64 leads to factorization of the integrand and to the separation of variables @xmath6 and @xmath64 which enables us to express the result as product of contour integrals f = _ j=1^m+n",
