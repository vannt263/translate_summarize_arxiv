    "to study cosmic - ray propagation in the galaxy , a detailed knowledge of the structure of the magnetic fields is essential .",
    "unfortunately , the question about the configuration of the galactic magnetic field remains open  different models exist based on experimental data @xcite . how cosmic rays are accelerated to extremely high energies",
    "is another unanswered question .",
    "although the popular model of cosmic - ray acceleration by shock waves in the expanding shells of supernovae ( see e.g. @xcite ) is almost recognized as `` standard theory , '' there are still a number of unresolved problems .",
    "furthermore , the question about other acceleration mechanisms is not quite clear , and could lead to different cosmic - ray energy spectra at the sources @xcite .",

    "the influence of hall diffusion becomes predominant at sufficiently high energies ( @xmath52  ev ) .",
    "the sharp enhancement of the diffusion coefficient leads to the excessive cosmic - ray leakage from the galaxy at energies @xmath53  ev . for investigating the cosmic - ray propagation at such energies",
    "it is necessary to carry out calculations of the trajectories for individual particles .",
    "the numerical calculation of trajectories is based on the solution of the equation of motion for a charged particle in the magnetic field of the galaxy .",
    "the calculation was carried out using a fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "trajectories of cosmic rays were calculated until they left the galaxy .",
    "testing the differential scheme used , it was found that the accuracy of the obtained trajectories for protons with an energy @xmath54  ev after passing a distance of 1  pc amounts to @xmath55  pc .",
    "the retention time of a proton with such an energy averages to about 10 million years , hence , a total error for the trajectory approximation by the differential scheme is about 0.5  pc .",

    "there is almost no difference between the two approaches .",

    "the has to be compared to the value predicted by the diffusion model . in the latter",
    "the change should be @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the observed value is obviously larger , which implies that the remaining change of the spectral shape should be caused by a change of the spectrum at the source , e.g. due to the maximum energy attained in the acceleration process .    the maximum energy and , therefore , the energy at which the spectrum steepens depends on the intensity of the magnetic fields in the acceleration zone and on a number of assumptions for the feedback of cosmic rays to the shock front .",
    "the uncertainty of the parameters yields variations in the maximum energy predicted by different models up to a factor of 100 @xcite .",

    "nuclear fragmentation is taken into account in an approximate approach @xcite .",

    "it is frequently assumed that the propagation path length decreases as function of energy @xmath97 , as discussed above .",

    "however , for elements heavier than iron the interaction path length is smaller than the escape path length for all energies , except above the respective . at low energies the propagation path length exceeds the interaction path length by about an order of magnitude . for these elements",
    "nuclear interaction processes are dominant for the shape of the observed spectrum .",
