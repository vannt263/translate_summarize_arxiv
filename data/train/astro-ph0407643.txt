    "according to the unified scheme as originally suggested by @xcite , two types ( types 1 & 2 ) of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) originate from the same object ( a supermassive black hole surrounded by an optically - thick torus ) that is viewed at different angles .",
    "this hypothesis has stimulated intensive millimeter - wave interferometric observations to search for molecular tori toward agns .",
    "for example , images of the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 show a @xmath9 pc disk or torus of molecular gas around its agn , with a rotational axis parallel to the axis of its radio continuum jet @xcite .",
    "sub - arcsecond @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) observations suggest that this torus / disk is warped and viewed nearly edge - on at a radius of less than 110 pc @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent surveys of seyfert galaxies suggest that the circumnuclear molecular gas has a wide variety of distributions , and does not always exhibit a centrally - peaked component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it may be that only a fraction of agns have molecular tori detectable in current observations , making detailed studies of such examples especially important .",
    "m51 ( ngc 5194 ) , a grand - design spiral galaxy at a distance d @xmath10 8.4 mpc @xcite , has a type 2 agn @xcite . as in the case of ngc 1068",
    ", @xcite showed that the agn of m51 is surrounded by a @xmath9 pc disk / torus of dense molecular gas with a rotational axis parallel to the axis of the central radio jet @xcite .",
    "the estimated column density of the molecular gas exceeds @xmath11 @xmath12 , which is comparable with the amount of obscuring material inferred from x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath13co and hcn j = 1  0 observations suggest that the circumnuclear molecular gas is dense ( @xmath14 @xmath6 ) and warm ( @xmath15 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these conditions suggest that the nuclear disk / torus can be better studied in higher - j transitions , such as @xmath0co j = 3  2 ( the critical density for this transition is @xmath16 @xmath6 , and the energy of the j = 3 level corresponds to 33 k ) .    here",
    ", we report observations of the central region of m51 with the submillimeter array ( sma ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) line .",
    "as anticipated , the central molecular torus / disk emits stronger in the j = 3  2 than the j = 1  0 , but we also detected emission from a spiral arm .",
    "we point out that this torus / disk exhibits a velocity gradient not only along its major axis , but also along its minor axis parallel to the radio jet .",
    "the submillimeter - wave aperture synthesis images toward the center of m51 were obtained in the @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) line ( rest frequency = 345.796 ghz ) with the sma .",
    "the observations were made on 2003 june 12 and 14 during the testing and commissioning phase when a total of four 6 m antennas were available .",
    "the sma correlator had a 0.96 ghz bandwidth at the time , and was configured to have a frequency resolution of 0.8125 mhz .",
    "we observed mars and uranus , respectively , for bandpass and flux calibration , and j1310 + 323 every 20 minutes for amplitude and phase calibration . the uncertainty in the absolute flux scale is estimated to be @xmath10 20% .",
    "we calibrated the data using the ovro software package mir , which was modified for the sma .",
    "the images were cleaned using the nrao software package aips , and the resultant angular resolution was @xmath1 ( 160 pc @xmath2 65 pc ) at a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath17 with natural weighting .",
    "we made channel maps with 42 channel binning , which corresponds to a velocity resolution of 29.6 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the typical rms noise level of the channel maps was 70.4 mjy beam@xmath8 , which corresponds to t@xmath18 k. the half - power width of the primary beam at 345 ghz is @xmath19 ( 1.5 kpc ) .",
    "we did not detect any continuum emission at the rms noise level attained of 18 mjy beam@xmath8 .",
    "channel and integrated intensity maps in @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) as shown in figures  [ fig - channel ] and [ fig - intmap ] show a strong peak at the nucleus at redshifted velocities ( with respect to the systemic velocity of 472 km s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the highest velocity of the compact nuclear emission is @xmath20 km s@xmath8 ( as can be seen also in the position - velocity diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig - pv ] ) , comparable with the highest velocity seen in the redshifted wing of the @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) spectrum taken with the jcmt @xcite .",
    "our maps also show weak emission from the spiral arm to the northwest of the nucleus ( hereafter , the northwestern arm ) at blueshifted velocities .",
    "the spiral arm to the south - east ( hereafter , the southeastern arm ) was not detected . the previously published single - dish @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) maps @xcite also show the intensity asymmetry , which is stronger emission from the northwestern than from the southeastern arm .",
    "the compact nuclear emission also appears at redshifted velocities in interferometric @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similarly , interferometric @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) observations by @xcite also show predominantly redshifted emission , concentrated 1  west of the nucleus , but in addition relatively weak blueshifted emission east of the nucleus ( see their figs .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the integrated intensity of their blueshifted emission is only 18% of that of the redshifted emission , with a deconvolved size for the blueshifted emission of less than @xmath21 . in our map ,",
    "the redshifted emission was detected at a peak integrated intensity of @xmath22 at a beam size of @xmath1 .",
    "assuming the redshifted and blueshifted emission in j = 3  2 has the same intensity ratio as that in j = 2  1 , the blueshifted emission is expected to have a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath23 .",
    "we rule out the possibility that the systemic velocity of the circumnuclear molecular gas is different from that of the host galaxy ( 472 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "interferometric hcn(j = 1  0 ) observations by @xcite show a compact nuclear component with comparable bright redshifted and blueshifted emission symmetrically placed either side of the nucleus , interpreted as an approximately edge - on rotating disk or torus .",
    "the missing flux in our map was estimated by comparing our data with previous single - dish observations .",
    "the flux within the central @xmath24 and @xmath25 region in our @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) map ( corrected for primary beam attenuation ) is 13.8 k km s@xmath8 ( 228 jy beam@xmath8 km s@xmath8 ) and 8.8 k km s@xmath8 ( 499 jy beam@xmath8 km s@xmath8 ) respectively .",
    "the single - dish flux are 43.1@xmath262.0 k km s@xmath8 within @xmath24 @xcite and 47@xmath267 k km s@xmath8 within @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we therefore recovered only 32% and 19% of the single - dish flux for the central @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , suggesting that there exists extended @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) emission in the central region .",
    "indeed , the single - dish @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) maps show very similar image with the single - dish j = 2  1 or 1  0 maps , namely , even j = 3  2 emission is rich in extended structures @xcite , which support our result .",
    "the missing flux of @xmath27 is , however , larger than that in the past extragalactic @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) observations of @xmath28 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the possibility of calibration errors in single - dish data should be low , because the above values are consistent with each other , and also consistent with the independent hht ( @xmath29 k km s@xmath8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the cso ( 48.3 k km s@xmath8 with @xmath30 beam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations .",
    "an underestimate of the absolute flux in our data is possible , but this would suggest more extreme conditions at the central region of m51 ( see the next paragraph and section ) .",
    "we compared the intensities of the nuclear molecular gas components using our @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) data with the interferometric j = 1  0 data @xcite .",
    "first , we convolved our j = 3  2 image to the same resolution as that in j = 1  0 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the j = 3  2 and 1  0 line intensities at the nucleus averaged over this beam size ( 170 pc @xmath2 140 pc ) are @xmath32 k km s@xmath8 and @xmath33 k km s@xmath8 , respectively ( temperatures are in the rayleigh - jeans approximation , and the uncertainties are @xmath34 ) .",
    "the j = 3  2 line is therefore stronger than the j = 1  0 line , with a @xmath0co(j = 3  2)/(j = 1  0 ) intensity ratio , @xmath35 , of @xmath36 .",
    "this line ratio may be a lower limit , as the j = 1  0 data have shorter baselines than the j = 3  2 data . to remedy this , we truncated the inner @xmath37-plane of the j = 1  0 data to match that in the j = 3  2 data , and recomputed the line intensities following the above method .",
    "the resultant @xmath35 at the nucleus averaged over this beam size ( @xmath38 or 160 pc @xmath2 110 pc ) is @xmath39 , where the larger uncertainty reflects the noisier j = 1  0 image due to the inner @xmath37 truncation .",
    "in the following discussion , we adopt @xmath35 of @xmath36 , keeping in mind that this is probably a lower limit .",
    "we made position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams along and perpendicular to the axis of the radio continuum jet ( p.a .",
    "of @xmath40 ) from the nucleus ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pv ] ) . to compute the magnitude of the velocity gradient",
    ", we first searched for the strongest peak ( exceeding @xmath41 ) within a 5  radius of the nucleus at each velocity bin ( width of 14.8 km s@xmath8 ) in the pv diagram .",
    "we then applied a linear fit to these peaks weighted by their respective intensities .",
    "in this way , we inferred a linear velocity gradient perpendicular to the jet axis of @xmath42 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 , and parallel to the jet axis of @xmath43 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 .",
    "the sense of the velocity gradient perpendicular to the jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig - pv]a ) is the same as that found in the past interferometric observations @xcite ; the magnitude of the velocity gradient of 1.39 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 is comparable with that estimated from the interferometric hcn(j = 1  0 ) observations of @xmath44 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this velocity gradient is attributed to a nearly edge - on rotating molecular disk or torus around the nucleus .",
    "the velocity gradient along the jet has not been previously discussed , but can also be seen in the channel / velocity maps in both co j = 1  0 and 2  1 ( see fig .  2 of @xcite and fig .",
    "1q of @xcite ) . based on these arguments",
    ", we believe the existence of a velocity gradient parallel in addition to that perpendicular to the radio jet to be real , although we note that the circumnuclear emission is poorly resolved and hence the actual magnitude of the velocity gradients may need to be revised when observations at higher angular resolutions become available .",
    "the @xmath35 within an @xmath3 pc radius of the nucleus of m51 is @xmath36 , more than twice as high as the ratios measured by single - dish telescopes at lower spatial resolutions ; line ratios observed with the beam sizes of @xmath45 ( @xmath46 pc ) are @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the circumnuclear molecular gas must therefore be considerably different from that in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "we estimated the physical conditions of the circumnuclear molecular gas using the large - velocity - gradient ( lvg ) approximation @xcite assuming a one - zone model .",
    "the collision rates for co in the temperature range @xmath48 k were taken from @xcite and @xmath49 k from @xcite .",
    "the velocity gradient is estimated to be about 1.39 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 ( sect .",
    "[ res ] ) .",
    "this value is consistent with the gradient caused by the internal turbulence ( @xmath50 km s@xmath8 pc@xmath8 ; for a more detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "using the ` standard ' relative abundance [ @xmath0co]/[h@xmath51 @xmath52 , we find the h@xmath53 number density @xmath54 @xmath6 and the kinetic temperature @xmath55 k , with the uncertainties reflecting the uncertainty in @xmath35 . even for an order of magnitude lower relative abundance or an order of magnitude higher velocity gradient",
    ", this model gives @xmath54 @xmath6 and @xmath56 k. we therefore conclude that the circumnuclear molecular gas is denser and warmer than the molecular gas in the galactic disk .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the interferometric @xmath13co and hcn j = 1  0 observations , which also suggest dense ( @xmath57 @xmath6 ) and warm ( @xmath58 k ) molecular gas based on lvg calculations @xcite .",
    "there are several possible reasons for the rather extreme conditions of the molecular gas .",
    "one is interaction with the radio jet .",
    "molecular outflows from star forming regions in our galaxy show @xmath35 greater than unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to that in the center of m51 .",
    "the strongest @xmath0co(j = 3  2 ) emission in our channel maps comes from @xmath59 north - west of the nucleus ( 484 km s@xmath8 in fig  [ fig - channel ] ) , and this also is a region with high [ ] /h@xmath60 intensity ratio ( @xmath61 ) . the high [ ]",
    "/h@xmath60 ratio suggests that relativistic particle heating is dominant @xcite , which suggests an interaction between the jet and molecular gas .",
    "recent high resolution h@xmath53o maser observations reveal that the masers are located close to the nucleus , and are possibly associated with the jet @xcite .",
    "the velocity range of the h@xmath53o masers of @xmath62 km s@xmath8 is similar to that of the redshifted nuclear emission in our data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - channel ] and [ fig - pv ] ) , which also supports the idea that the molecular gas is interacting with or entrained by the jet .",
    "shock / compression by supernova ( sn ) explosions is another possibility , since shocked molecular gas around sn remnants in our galaxy also shows high intensity ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the linear velocity gradient _ along _ the jet axis is an interesting phenomenon , and it is worth considering what may cause this gradient .",
    "we first calculate the mass , momentum , and kinetic energy of the molecular gas within the velocity range of 515  615 km s@xmath8 , which is away from the systemic velocity .",
    "the co - to - h@xmath53 conversion factor can be estimated using the lvg approximation mentioned above , and the result is @xmath63 @xmath12 ( k km s@xmath8)@xmath8 . the mass is calculated using this conversion factor and the intensities of molecular gas . in each channel map within the velocity range ,",
    "the velocity of the molecular gas is defined as the velocity difference from the systemic velocity , and we assume that the molecular gas is moving along the line of sight .",
    "thus the estimated values are lower limits . adding all channel map information , we estimated the mass , momentum , and kinetic energy as @xmath64 m@xmath65 , @xmath66 g cm s@xmath8 , and @xmath67 erg , respectively .    using these values",
    ", we discuss the possible causes of the velocity gradient along the jet axis .",
    "one is that the molecular gas away from the systemic velocity is entrained by the jet , namely , relativistic particles .",
    "the minimum energy of the jet is @xmath68 erg @xcite , and the momentum is @xmath69 g cm s@xmath8 , if we assume that the velocity of the relativistic particles is 90% of the speed of light . @xcite",
    "estimated the energy of the jet assuming the total energy of the jet plasma is 100 times larger than that of electrons .",
    "this number can be larger , but it should be smaller than the mass ratio of proton and electron of about 1800 . the actual geometry of the jet and the molecular gas is unclear , but should be similar if molecular gas is entrained by the jet .",
    "therefore the energy of the jet may be similar to that of the molecular gas , but the momentum is several orders of magnitude different .",
    "this problem is also seen in the study of young stellar objects , and still under discussion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another possibility is that since the momentum and energy can be transferred from one to another by interaction . if those of the molecular gas along the jet are continuously input by the jet via interaction , the momentum and energy differences between the molecular gas and the jet can be explained",
    "indeed , the high [ ] /h@xmath60 ratio ( an evidence of relativistic heating ) and the h@xmath53o masers ( an evidence of shocked molecular gas ) are observed , as mentioned above .",
    "these observations support the idea that the energy and momentum of the molecular gas along the jet are transferred from the radio jet via interaction .",
    "there are several possible explanations to create the velocity gradient along the jet without considering interaction with the radio jet .",
    "supernova ( sn ) explosions can be one of the possible causes , based on the similarity of @xmath35 as mentioned above . however , @xmath70 sne are needed to explain the energy of the molecular gas , if we assume that one sn releases @xmath71 erg and that the energy transfer efficiency is at most 20% @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the velocity gradient along the jet may be due to a warped disk around the agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , not all",
    "the gas is on a plane of a molecular gas disk .",
    "thus , even if most of the gas show velocity gradient perpendicular to the jet , some of the gas show velocity gradient along the jet .",
    "future sma observations with higher spatial resolution will provide more detailed information about the molecular gas around the agn .",
