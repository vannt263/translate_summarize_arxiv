    "the study of stellar rotation is important for our understanding of many kinematic properties of stars , including the origin and evolution of the rotation itself ; more generally , the origin and evolution of stellar angular momentum ; and the role of rotation in stellar magnetism and mixing of chemical elements .",
    "stars are formed from rotating molecular cloud cores and preserve only a very small fraction of the initial angular momentum of these cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "the initial angular momentum of the initial molecular cloud is approximately eight orders of magnitude greater than that of the stars that eventually form from such a cloud core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the discovery of extra  solar planets ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) , new questions concerning rotation have begun to arise , including questions regarding the large  scale effects of the presence of planetary companions on stellar rotation @xcite and on the heating of stellar coronae and chromospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "admittedly , the study of the rotation of planet  hosting stars is hampered by one major factor : for the great majority of stars with planets only the projected rotational velocity @xmath2 is available , and all such bodies identified , to date are essentially slow  to  very  moderate rotators @xcite . despite this constraint , alves et al . have noted that stars without any detected planets demonstrate a clear angular momentum deficit compared with stars with planets .",
    "the recent space  missions corot @xcite and _ kepler _ @xcite are providing a new window into the study of the behavior of stellar rotation , including the rotation of stars with planets , by virtue of their high  precision photometry , which yields excellent quality light curves ( lcs ) .",
    "in addition to their high precision , these missions provide nearly uninterrupted photometric measurements of unprecedented duration and cadence , allowing for refined analysis of the features involved in the behavior of these temporal series , as in @xcite . in recent works ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite computed the rotation periods ( @xmath3 ) for a large fraction of the _ kepler _ targets , including the _ kepler _ objects of interest ( hereafter koi ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed the first 11 quarters of _ kepler _ data by computing fourier periodograms and autocorrelation functions ( acf ) , and validated their results through visual inspection .",

    "@xcite measured the periods of 737 main  sequence koi stars to study the relation between the rotational and orbital periods ; they found that hotter stars rotate more rapidly .",
    "@xcite derived periods for @xmath5 main  sequence stars , excluding eclipsing binaries and koi stars , and found that the majority of these stars are typically younger than 4.5  gyr and exhibit higher peak  to  peak amplitudes for smaller periods .",

    "these authors identified a trend of magnetic braking when comparing rotation periods with the gyrochronological relations from @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported rotation periods and ages for approximately 950 koi stars , and through comparison with spectroscopic data , they estimated the corresponding stellar orientation angles",
    ". these authors also used gyrochronological ages based on @xcite , in combination with the calibrations of @xcite to estimate stellar ages .    in this work we present rotation periods for 131 planet  hosting _ kepler _ stars .",
    "we computed the rotation periods using a robust procedure , that combines the standard lomb ",
    "scargle periodogram @xcite with the wavelet technique @xcite .",

    ", we are able to present an overview of the rotational behavior of these stars on the hertzsprung  russell ( hr ) diagram .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ keplerdata ] , the working stellar sample , the _ kepler _ data and the procedure used for the computation of periods are presented .",

    "our conclusions are presented in section [ conclus ] .",
    "from may 2009 to may 2013 the nasa _ kepler _ mission collected data in an steady field of view for @xmath8 stars in 17 runs ( known as _ quarters _ ) which were composed of _ long cadence _ ( 6.02 s observations stacked every 29.4 minutes , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and _ short cadence _ ( bins of 59 seconds ) observations @xcite .",
    "we selected all public light curves lcs available in the _ kepler _ public archive for planet  hosting stars and kois between quarters 1 and 17 , which were collected over the noted range of four years ( from may 13 , 2009 , to may 08 , 2013 ) . from this parent sample , 408 _",

    "in particular , the _ kepler _ database provides both simple aperture photometry ( sap ) data , which were processed using a standard treatment , and pre  search data conditioning ( pdc ) data , which were analyzed using a more refined treatment based on the pdc routine from the _ kepler _ pipeline @xcite .",

    ", the parent samples of the kcp host stars and kois were analyzed using the pdc lcs .",

    "most of these lcs are of excellent quality and required no additional treatment of artifacts . however , for the final solutions some _ _ flare  like _ _ signatures ( as described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and known planetary transits were removed . removing transits and _",
    "flare  like _ signatures allows for better isolation of other sources of stellar lc variability , which may include rotational modulation . in total",
    "we removed all transits from all 408 stars of the kcp parent sample and 61 _ flare  like _ signatures found in 26 ( of the 408 ) stars of the kcp parent sample .",
    "we also removed outliers by discarding all flux measurements that exceeded 3.5@xmath9 from a 3@xmath10order polynomial fit to each quarters lc .",
    "furthermore , some few remaining instrumental trends ( as described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were removed .",
    "these included , in particular , thermal noise ( which was predominantly produced by variations in the overall spacecraft temperature that were induced by the monthly pointing of the antenna toward earth for data transmission ) , which manifested as exponential decays in the lcs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and _ safe  mode",
    "_ signatures ( induced by cosmic rays hitting the detector ) , which also exhibited high ",
    "slope decays @xcite .",
    "both types of artifact exhibited very similar shapes , and they were visually identified for exclusion .",
    "figure  [ thermal ] presents an example of a lc from which transits and artifacts were removed .",
    "because both the lomb  scargle periodograms and wavelet maps were calculated using discrete transforms of the time series , both types of analysis were capable of treating the gaps introduced by removing the data , as described above .",
    "finally , individual quarters were combined to produce a single long ",
    "term lc for each object .",
    "the quarter  to  quarter transitions typically manifested as flux offsets ( jumps ) , which were adjusted through a linear fit and extrapolation of user  defined boxes before and after each jump , as described by @xcite and @xcite .    for data analysis , lomb ",
    "scargle periodograms were computed over the entire sample within a frequency range of 0.01  0.5  d@xmath11 . as in @xcite , we defined a maximum frequency of 0.5  d@xmath11 ( or a minimum period of 2.0  d ) to avoid pollution of the samples with sources of variability other than rotational modulation ( typically pulsations or oscillations ) . the lomb ",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used to compute confidence levels .",
    "accordingly , in each periodogram , we identified the main peak with a confidence level of greater than 99% .",
    "we also computed wavelet maps and global wavelet power spectra within the same frequency range that was used for the lomb ",
    "scargle periodograms , following the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "these authors treated the 6@xmath12order morlet wavelet as the mother wavelet , because of its good time localization and frequency resolution @xcite .",
    "the width of the mother wavelet was variable and was defined by @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the so  called _ scale _ ( the period decomposition in our case ) , @xmath15 is the minimum scale ( with a value of 2.0 for our calculations ) , @xmath16 is the scale bin ( with a value of 0.1 for our calculations ) , and @xmath17 is an iterative index that ranges from 0 to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the total number of scales . wavelet analysis is a powerful tool for analysis of frequency variations over time , for a given signal decomposed at various resolutions .",
    "in addition to revealing the stability of superposed variability periods over time , the time  frequency representation of wavelet maps allows us to identify specific signatures that are related to variability behaviors .",

    "20 in the cited publication ) .",
    "we then identified the main peaks in the global wavelet periodograms with confidence levels of greater than 99% .",
    "subsequently , we performed an automatic pre ",
    "selection of kois and kcp host stars , which were then visually inspected for our final selection .",
    "this automatic pre  selection was less strict for kcp host stars than for kois because the kcp host stars comprised our main sample , which was sufficiently small for visual inspection to be feasible .",

    "in addition , the results of the kolmogorov  smirnov test ( distance of 0.117 and probability of @xmath40 ) and the anderson  darling test ( asymptotic probability of @xmath41 ) performed using the ` r ` software package @xcite strongly indicate that the two distributions are drawn from different parent distributions .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ histo ] , the kcp sample would have shorter period values in the present work than in the literature , in average , thus being more populated at negative values of the abscissa than the koi sample .",
    "however , this apparent discrepancy is actually a bias produced by a trend of computing a set of @xmath35values in the present work that are an half of those provided in the literature .",

    "[ permass ] , the expected decay trend is observed : faster rotators have higher masses ( engulfment can be invoked for the rapid rotators with signatures of close planets ) .",
    "however , because of the range of masses that we investigated we did not observe the change in slope that was detected by @xcite .",
    "another notable case is that of the star kic  12735740 , whose spectroscopic parameters are given by @xcite .",
    "this target exhibits values of temperature , surface gravity , mass , and radius that are similar to the solar values , but it has a lower p@xmath53 ( 19.64  @xmath20  0.61 d ) , similar to the case of @xmath54 eridani @xcite .",
    "there is a notable spectral similarity between kic  12735740 and the sun in the h region ( see fig .  3 of * ?",
    "* ) , which leads those authors to conclude that this star is chromospherically inactive . in support of this conclusion",
    ", the star has a very slow projected rotation velocity , with @xmath2 ( 1.43  @xmath20  0.78  km  s@xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is similar to the solar value ( 1.6  @xmath20  0.3  km  s@xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "the apparent discordance that arises from kic  12735740 exhibiting a smaller @xmath35than that of the sun but a similar @xmath2 value , depends on the values of the microturbulence and macroturbulence , along with the inclination angle .",
    "this angle can contribute significantly to the projected velocity .",
    "therefore a strict comparison ( which is plausible only in the case of homoscedasticity ) is difficult to perform . to reinforce this claim ,",
    "it should be noted that @xmath54 eridani has a period of 11.20  d @xcite and a @xmath2 value of 2.45  km  s@xmath11 according to @xcite , but this value decreases to 1.7  km  s@xmath11 in the photometric  based measure of @xcite ( see   5.2 in the cited study ) .",
    "its temperature of @xmath55  k @xcite is slightly sub  solar , nevertheless , its surface gravity ( 4.57  dex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is consistent with the solar value .",
    "other relevant parameters of @xmath54 eridani include its radius and mass , which are similar to the solar values ( 0.82 m@xmath56and 0.74  @xmath57 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and its younger age of 850  myr @xcite .",
    "therefore , care must be taken in any direct comparison that is based solely on @xmath58 .",
    "one of the most notable characteristics of the solar system is its large amount of angular momentum , which is largely associated with jupiter , which possesses at least two orders of magnitude more orbital angular momentum than the spin angular momentum of the sun itself . in this context",
    ", we also analyzed the stellar angular momentum , which was obtained using the relation @xmath59m@xmath60 , ( this is the stellar contribution only , with no planetary contribution ) of the stars that compose the present sample , to examine how their spins compare with that of the sun . for the @xmath61 uncertainty we performed a markov chain monte carlo analysis ,",
    "in which , kraft  s relation @xcite was employed as the fit to the model and fluctuations compatible with stellar angular momentum uncertainties were then applied to the fit .",
    "a total of @xmath62 iterations were performed and the uncertainty was defined as in   [ mcmc ] .",
    "figure  [ j_mass ] presents the distribution of the stellar angular momentum @xmath63 as a function of stellar mass for our sample of _ kepler _ stars with planets , for which the @xmath63 values were computed following the procedure proposed by @xcite .",
    "the sun is represented by its usual symbol .",
    "the solid line illustrates the best fit of krafts relation @xmath59m@xmath60 ( @xmath61=@xmath64 ) @xcite with our star sample , where the exponent @xmath61 of the power law was treated as a free parameter . clearly , the distribution of the stellar angular momentum for stars with masses of greater than approximately 0.80  m@xmath56follows , at least qualitatively , the law @xmath65m@xmath60 , as previously demonstrated by @xcite for stars with planets detected using the doppler method .",
    "the mass range of applicability of this relation is as follows : its lower end is given by the mass limit of f and g  type stars ( approximately 0.8  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "conversely , the upper mass limit ( approximately 1.25  m@xmath1 ) was set based on @xcite , according to whom such stars possess thin convection zones . above this mass regime",
    "the relation between angular momentum and mass obeys a different power law ( the high  mass relation of   3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of the emergence of a radiative outer zone ; consequently , the influence of stellar convective transport in stellar envelopes rapidly decreases its influence on the relation between angular momentum and mass for high  mass stars .    of the total working sample of 131 kcp host stars , the required parameters for the computation of the total angular momentum are present in the literature for only 38 stars .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ j_mass ] displays the distribution of the total angular momentum of the star ",
    "planet systems of these stars as a function of stellar mass .",
    "the sun symbol in this figure corresponds to the total angular momentum of the solar system .",
    "interestingly , although most of the planet hosting _ kepler _ stars exhibit a trend of excess in stellar angular momentum compared with that of the sun , as observed in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ j_mass ] , the angular momentum of the star  planet systems exhibits a somewhat different behavior , with a number of kcp host stars exhibiting total angular momenta that are comparable to that of the solar system and other kcp host stars exhibiting a deficit in total angular momentum , compared with the sun .",
    "in addition , @xcite demonstrated that stars that host more massive planets tend to have higher angular momenta , whereas stars that host less massive planets tend to have lower angular momenta .",
    "we tested these findings , namely , the results presented in fig .  9 of @xcite , using our sample and , in contrast with the results of the previous authors , no clear dependence of the stellar angular momentum on the planetary mass was observed .",
    "there are at least two possible explanations for these results : ( i )  the relatively low - number of stars in the kcp sample may hinder a proper statistical treatment of the results , and ( ii )  an important number of kcp sources may host undetected planets , thus biasing the results .",
    "the latter explanation suggests the potential for the detection of new planets in the kcp sample .",
    "however , another possible explanation for the discrepancy between the present finding and that of @xcite resides in the procedure used for the detection of the planets .",
    "the sample selected by @xcite was based on radial velocities , whereas the present sample was chosen based on eclipse data , in which the handicap of detecting planets closer to the stellar host is not present because of the typical observation window of the _ kepler _ satellite .",
    "we analyzed photometric variations in the current sample of _ kepler _ planetary host stars and determined @xmath35for a final sample of 131 sources .",
    "these periods were calculated independently via the lomb  scargle and wavelet methods , thereby yielding a reliable @xmath35determination . as remarked in ",
    "[ keplerdata ] , this unified method allowed us to consistently distinguish @xmath35from other manifestations of magnetic activity , even when the associated amplitude variations were of the same order of magnitude .",
    "our @xmath35values are consistent with those previously reported in the literature by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "they are also in strong agreement with the theoretical predictions of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the agreement between the tracks from @xcite and our data is clear and provides good experimental support for stellar rotation theory , despite possible different initial conditions between the models and observed stars .",
    "the present analyses has also revealed an interesting group of 5 kcp and 12 koi stars with @xmath49 and @xmath51 values similar to those of the sun and rotation period ranging from 7 to 26 days .",
    "of particular interest are the stars kic  9455556 , kic  11565544 , and kic  12644822 , rotating with periods similar to the suns values , namely 25.78  d , 24.93  d , and 23.51  d , respectively .",
    "finally , the stellar angular momenta of our subsample of 131 kcp and 193 koi stars follow kraft  s relation , thus offering an important generalization of this law for a particular sample with known planets and photometric @xmath35measurements . despite this result",
    ", no relationship between stellar angular momentum and planetary mass was found , in contrast with the results of @xcite .",
    "open questions remain because robust statistics from a larger planetary host sample are required .",
    "for example , to what extent do low @xmath35values reflect a bias in detectability ? how does planetary systems affect the @xmath3 value of the central star ?",
    "a larger sample will also help elucidate the behavior of angular momentum with respect to planetary mass , which is a crucial ingredient in the modeling of star ",
    "companion systems .",
    "special attention must be payed to the koi and kic stars presenting suns rotation rate and @xmath49 and @xmath51 solar values , for which a solid spectroscopic study could show how close of the present day sun are their evolutionary stages .",
