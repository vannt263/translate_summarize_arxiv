    "[ introduction ]    one of the most important challenges of theoretical physics is the development of reliable methods for the quantitative calculation of material properties . in solid state theory , we know the hamiltonian to do these material calculations . for example , if we neglect relativistic corrections and employ the born - oppenheimer @xcite approximation , this hamiltonian consists of three terms : the kinetic energy , the lattice potential and the coulomb interaction between the electrons : @xmath14\\;\\;\\ ; + \\;\\;\\ ;      \\frac{1}{2 } \\ ; \\sum_{i\\neq j } \\ ; { } { \\frac{\\displaystyle   e^2}{\\displaystyle 4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\ ; \\frac{\\displaystyle 1}{\\displaystyle |{\\bf r}_i -{\\bf r}_j|}}. \\label{abinitioham}\\ ] ] here , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the position of electron @xmath17 and ion @xmath18 with charge @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ; @xmath21 is the laplace operator for the kinetic energy of electrons with mass @xmath22 ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the vacuum dielectric and planck constant .",
    "the three terms of hamiltonian [ [ abinitioham ] ] describe the movement of the electrons , the attractive lattice potential of the ( fixed ) ions and the mutual coulomb repulsion of the electrons , see fig .",
    "[ figham ] for an illustration .",
    "but while we know the hamiltonian , we can not solve it , even not numerically , if more than a very few [ @xmath25 electrons are involved .",
    "this problem is due to the last term , the coulomb interaction , which correlates the movement of every electron @xmath17 with every other electron @xmath26 .",
    "the numerical effort to solve eq .",
    "[ [ abinitioham ] ] quantum - mechanically grows exponentially with the number of correlated electrons .",

    "different basis sets will hence produce different results , unless more and more orbitals are considered as interacting in dmft and more and more non - local correlations are taken into account .",
    "this poses the so - far open question : what is the optimal basis set for lda+dmft ?",
    "many transition metal oxides are cubic perovskites , often with a slight distortion of the ideal cubic crystal structure . in these systems ,",
    "the cubic crystal field of the oxygen ions splits the @xmath37-orbitals into three degenerate @xmath31 and two degenerate @xmath83 orbitals .",
    "this splitting is often so strong that the @xmath31 or @xmath83 bands at the fermi energy are rather well separated from all other bands . for the low energy physics ,",
    "it is hence sufficient to take only those bands into account which cross the fermi energy , e.g. the three @xmath31 bands .",
    "note that these effective bands at the fermi energy are not purely of @xmath37 character .",
    "these are the effective bands corresponding to the lda eigenenergies .",
    "hence , they also contain contributions of the other orbitals , in particular the oxygen @xmath36 orbitals due to hybridisation effects .",
    "from a conventional lda bandstructure calculation , these effective low - energy bands can be accurately determined via the nmto downfolding approach of andersen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite or the projection to wannier orbitals @xcite .",
    "if the transition metal oxide is cubic or only slightly distorted , a further simplification can be employed for the ( almost ) degenerate bands at the fermi energy : instead of the full lda hamiltonian @xmath84 in eq .",
    "[ [ ldadmfth ] ] only the total dos of the low - lying bands needs to be taken into account within dmft : without symmetry breaking , the green function and the self energy of these bands remain degenerate , i.e. @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 ( i.e. the interacting orbitals at the fermi energy ) . downfolding to a basis with these",
    "degenerate @xmath88 bands results in an effective hamiltonian @xmath89 or a corresponding @xmath90 . from this reduced hamiltonian ,",
    "the diagonal element of the green function is calculated via @xmath91^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to the diagonal structure of the self energy , the degenerate interacting green function can be expressed via the non - interacting green function @xmath92 : @xmath93 thus , it is possible to use the hilbert transformation of the unperturbed lda - calculated density of states ( dos ) @xmath94 , i.e. eq .  [ intg ] , instead of the dyson equation ( eq . [ [ dyson ] ] ) with the full hamilton matrix @xmath90 .",
    "this simplifies the calculations considerably . with eq .",
    "[ [ intg ] ] also some conceptual simplifications arise : ( i ) the subtraction of the double counting correction @xmath95 only results in an ( unimportant ) shift of the chemical potential in eq .",
    "[ [ intg ] ] and , thus , the exact form of @xmath95 is irrelevant ; ( ii ) the theorem of mller - hartmann @xcite of a fixed spectral function at the fermi energy holds within a fermi liquid ; ( iii ) as the number of electrons within the different bands is fixed , a self - consistent lda+dmft calculation ( step 5 in section [ hamldadmft ] ) is dispensable . if the distortion from the cubic symmetry is only weak or if the off - diagonal elements of @xmath96 are small , a slight modification of eq .",
    "[ [ intg ] ] can be used : @xmath97 which now depends on the orbitals , albeit neglecting the orbital admixture .",
    "it should also be noted that the approximation eq.is justified only if the overlap between the @xmath31 orbitals and the other orbitals is rather weak .      within the concept of dmft ,",
    "a combined hartree+dmft approach is a very natural approximation , since the non - local ( density - density ) coulomb interaction @xmath98 enters only via the hartree @xcite term in the @xmath99 limit @xcite : there are @xmath100 equivalent @xmath98 terms so that @xmath98 has to scale like @xmath101 in order that the hartree energy contribution stays finite .",
    "this is exactly the analogy to the weiss @xcite mean field theory for spin models , in which the summed contribution of the neighbouring sites gives an effective weiss field @xmath102 so that the proper scaling is @xmath103 .",
    "consequently , other contributions scale at least like @xmath104 . for the fock term , i.e. fig .",
    "[ fighf ] ( right ) , this scaling is obvious since there is one green function @xmath105 connecting @xmath17 and @xmath26 .. ] note that si and smith @xcite and chitra and kotliar @xcite employed a different scaling @xmath106 in the so - called extended dmft , also see @xcite .",
    "this scaling results in additional diagrams , but requires to treat the hartree term separately since it would otherwise diverge .    , width=226 ]    the reader might think of the hartree+dmft approach as a special case of lda+dmft , in which the lda exchange and correlation potential @xmath107=0 $ ] . in our orbital basis",
    "@xmath108 , the hartree term contributes as @xmath109 which is the left diagram of fig .",
    "[ fighf ] and gives , fourier - transformed , a @xmath43-dependent self energy @xmath110 .",
    "an advantage is that hartree+dmft is a diagrammatic approach , consisting of the hartree diagram of fig .",
    "[ fighf ] and the local dmft contributions of all irreducible diagrams .",
    "because we know the hartree contribution diagrammatically , we are in full control of the double counting term of the many - body hamiltonian eq .  [ [ ldadmfth ] ] . diagram fig .

    "the advantages of hartree+dmft are that it follows the @xmath99 concept and that it is a very clear and diagrammatically controlled scheme .",
    "the disadvantage , however , is that by neglecting the lda exchange and correlation term all exchange and correlation contributions need to stem from dmft which only includes the local exchange and correlations . with the success of lda and its superiority over a simple hartree calculation ,",
    "this seems not to be sufficient .",
    "this explains the reluctance , in particular , of the physicists of the lda community , to implement such a scheme .",
    "indeed , hartree+dmft calculations have not been done in the context of realistic calculations ; for model hamiltonians see e.g. @xcite . a more thorough investigation of how well such a relatively simple scheme works for realistic calculations is mandatory .",
    "also note that with cluster dmft calculations , which were briefly discussed in section [ dca ] , more and more non - local exchange and correlation contributions can be taken into account so that the treatment of the remaining coulomb interaction terms by the hartree approximation is a less severe approximation .",
    "the calculation of the screened coulomb interaction parameters , however , remains challenging .    if one combined the hartree - fock @xcite approximation and dmft , at least the non - local exchange ( given by the right diagram of fig .  [ fighf ] )",
    "would be additionally included .",
    "the problem with the exchange term is that the kohn - sham equations become much more complicated due to the non - local nature of the exchange term : in terms of the first quantised wave functions @xmath117 , the hartree - fock equations read @xmath118 \\varphi _ { i}({\\bf r } ) & & \\nonumber \\\\ - \\sum_j \\int d^{3}{r^{\\prime } }   { { } { \\frac{\\displaystyle   e^2}{\\displaystyle 4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\ ; \\frac{\\varphi^*_{j}({\\bf r^{\\prime } } ) \\varphi_{i}({\\bf r^{\\prime}})}{\\displaystyle |{\\bf r } -{\\bf r^{\\prime } } | } } } \\varphi _ { j}({\\bf r})&=&\\varepsilon _ { i}\\;\\varphi_{i}({\\bf r } ) , \\label{hfeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] instead of the kohn - sham equation [ [ kohnsham ] ] . but because it is not local in @xmath67 , eq .",

    "this good description of the insulator might be astonishing if one considers that the starting point , the hartree self energy eq .

    "however , except for almost uncorrelated systems with @xmath178 , the hartree approximation is rather bad for the metallic phase .",
    "the reason is that it strongly overestimates the energy of the paramagnetic phase .",

    "such superconducting alkali - doped fullerenes a@xmath10c@xmath13 are molecular solids with a low bandwidth so that both the phonon frequencies and the coulomb interaction are compareable to the bandwidth , and the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling is of order 1 .",

    "the physics of materials with strong electronic correlations such as transition metal oxides and heavy fermion systems is characterised by renormalised quasiparticles or mott - insulating behaviour .",
    "conventional electronic structure calculations , for example , in the lda or gw approximation , can not capture this kind of physics and the corresponding energy scales .",
    "this became possible by incorporating dmft into realistic material calculations , merging the strength of lda ( or gw ) as an _ ab initio _ approach with that of dmft to deal with local electronic correlations between @xmath37 or @xmath0 electrons .",
    "lda+dmft proved to be a breakthrough and is by now a standard approach , albeit standardised program packages are still imperative and self - consistent calculations where the lda bands are renormalised due to the dmft correlations are still rare . also the calculation of physical quantities other than the electronic spectrum ,",
    "the quantity inherently obtained as the weiss field in dmft , is not yet standard . since in principle",
    "all physical quantities can be obtained , there are many opportunities for future work .",
    "one should be cautious however that non - local correlations , which are neglected in dmft , are not particularly important for the physical quantity at hand .",
    "so far , lda+dmft has been successfully applied to many materials , with the focus naturally on those with strong electronic correlations . among others ,",
    "the volume , the electronic and the phonon spectrum of pu , the changes of physical properties in ce through the volume collapse , and the ferromagnetism of fe and ni , including the famous 6 ev in ni , have been calculated .",
    "most work was devoted to transition metal oxides . here",
    ", the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition in v@xmath8o@xmath7 was investigated and the filling of the mott - hubbard gap with increasing temperature predicted .",
    "the gap in vo@xmath8 was identified as a spin - peirls gap , and the origin of the colossal magnetoresistance in manganites understood : the paramagnetic phase is insulating - like because of the localisation of electrons as lattice polaron , assisted by strong electronic correlations .",
    "even the , at first glance , simple system srvo@xmath7 was found to show interesting physics , i.e. ` kinks ' .",
    "in contrast to the calculations for transition metals and @xmath0 electron systems , those for transition metal oxides were restricted to the @xmath37 orbitals crossing the fermi energy , except for one recent calculation on nio @xcite .",
    "a severe drawback of most calculations was that the coulomb interaction has been used as a free parameter or was chosen ad hoc .",
    "this is against the spirit of _ ab - initio _ calculations which , as a matter of principle , should be parameter - free . encouraging in this respect are the calculations for the prototypical @xmath441 and @xmath462 materials ce and srvo@xmath7 which show that parameter - free lda+dmft calculations are possible if the constrained lda method is employed for determining the coulomb interaction . in the case of gw+dmft ,",
    "the coulomb interaction is even inherently obtained from gw . here , the challenge is to do dmft calculations with a frequency - dependent ( screened ) interaction .",
    "one should always keep in mind that lda+dmft is an approximation for solving the solid state hamiltonian .",
    "the starting point , lda , is already an approximation even for the extended @xmath35 and @xmath36 orbitals .",
    "the second approximation involved is the selection of the ` interacting ' orbitals which by principle is basic dependent . because of this also the determination of the coulomb interaction has a considerable uncertainty , less so for well localized @xmath441 orbitals but more for @xmath462 and particularly @xmath518 orbitals .",
    "similarly , the underlying spectral density functional theory is basis dependent , in very contrast to standard density functional theory .",
    "thirdly , dmft is a many - body approximation for dealing with strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "it neglects non - local correlations .",
    "moreover , the solution of the dmft impurity problem involves possibly a fourth approximation if for example the non - crossing or iterated perturbation theory is employed .",
    "while numerically exact quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations are also possible , they are restricted to temperatures at or above ( roughly ) room temperature since they become too expensive in terms of cpu time at lower temperatures . in this",
    "respect density matrix renormalization group calculations , continuous - time and projective quantum monte carlo simulations are promising alternatives for zero ( or low ) temperature .    a major challenge for the future will be to go beyond dmft , i.e. taking into account non - local correlations on top of the local dmft correlations in electronic structure calculations . in this respect , cluster extensions of dmft have already been applied intensively to the two - dimensional hubbard model with a focus on unconventional superconductivity .",
    "the numerical effort restricts these cluster extensions to short range correlations within a ( relatively small ) cluster .",
    "realistic multi - band calculations were hitherto even restricted to only two sites .",
    "this puts particular importance onto the correlation within this pair of sites and is hence naturally only appropriate for particular systems such as vo@xmath8 where such pair correlations dominate .",
    "many important phenomena in correlated electron systems on the other hand stem from long range correlations , e.g. magnons , the interplay between antiferromagnetic fluctuations and unconventional superconductivity , quantum critical points , and critical behavior in general .",
    "how these phenomena arise is quite well understood diagrammatically for weak coupling , which as a matter of course is not the proper starting point for strongly correlated electrons .",
    "but if we replace the bare coulomb interaction of the weak coupling perturbation theory by the local ( fully irreducible ) vertex , we generate a set of diagrams which includes both the local dmft diagrams and the dominant diagrams for long - range correlations .",
    "this is the very idea of the dynamical vertex approximation which has been introduced most recently along with alternative approaches .",
    "another long term goal for electronic structure calculations with dmft is the calculation of the the ionic positions hitherto taken from experiment , the inclusion of lattice dynamics , and eventually molecular dynamics on the basis of lda+dmft .    continuing the fruitful cooperation between bandstructure and many - body physicists",
    ", we can optimistically face these challenges in the future .",
    "electronic structure calculations employing dmft or its diagrammatic and cluster extensions will be a prospering area of research . in particular , such approaches will further improve our understanding of systems with strongly correlated electrons .",
    "the advances in electronic structure calculations through dmft put our ability to predict physical quantities of such strongly correlated materials onto a similar level as conventional electronic structure calculations for weakly correlated materials  at last .",
