    "periodic comet , p/2010 v1 ( ikeya - murakami , hereafter v1 ) was independently discovered by two amateur astronomers in japan , mr .",
    "kaoru ikeya and dr .",
    "shigeki murakami , in early 2010 november @xcite .",
    "they reported the comet to be at magnitude 89 at the time of discovery .",
    "later , the orbital elements ( semimajor axis @xmath10=3.083 au , eccentricity @xmath11=0.488 , and inclination @xmath12=9.38 ) showed that v1 is a short period comet with an orbital period of 5.41 years @xcite . figure [ fig : orbit ] shows the orbit projected on the ecliptic plane .",
    "it has a tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter , t@xmath13=3.013 , slightly larger than 3 .",
    "such comets are sometimes classified as encke - type comets ( 2p / encke has @xmath14 = 3.026 ) rather than jupiter - family comets , for which 2 @xmath15 3 @xcite . despite its short orbital period and considerable brightness at the time of discovery , it is interesting to note that v1 had not been previously detected .    to date , there are no published reports to characterize the physical properties of v1 .",
    "images taken by amateur astronomers showed interesting features .",
    "the comet was enveloped by a spherical cloud and the overall appearance was reminiscent of historic cometary outbursts in 17p / holmes . to characterize the physical properties",
    ", we obtained monitoring observations and compared them with a model based on the dynamics of dust grains .",
    "the data presented in this study were obtained with three telescopes : the ishigakijima astronomical observatory murikabushi 1.05-m telescope ( hereafter iao ) , the keck i 10-m telescope ( keck - i ) , and the indian institute of astrophysics 2.0-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) .",
    "a journal of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "details of the data acquisition and reduction are given in the following .",
    "long - term monitoring observations of v1 were taken at iao , in okinawa , japan with the murikabushi 1.05-m ritchey - chrtien telescope ( f/12 ) with a focal reducer and mitsume , a system to take contemporaneous images with three different filters of sdss @xmath16 , johnson ",
    "cousins @xmath17 , and @xmath18-band .",
    "each of the three cameras utilizes an alta u6 ( apogee instruments inc . )",
    "ccd with array size of 1024 @xmath6 1024 pixels and with pixel size of 24 @xmath6 24 .",
    "the effective wavelengths and the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) are @xmath19=4830  and @xmath20=1340  ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath19=6550  and @xmath20=1210  ( @xmath17 ) , and @xmath19=7990  and @xmath20=1570  ( @xmath18 ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the pixel size projected on the sky was 0.72  and the field of view was 12.3@xmath612.3 .",
    "the observations were made using non - sidereal tracking in sky conditions that were variable through our observation runs .",
    "multiband snapshots were obtained with the 10-m keck i telescope atop mauna kea on ut 2011 january 30 .",
    "images were taken using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ) camera @xcite , which houses red and blue optimized ccds separated by a dichroic filter ( we used the 460 dichroic , which has 50% transmission at 4875   ) .",
    "the image scale on both cameras was 0.135  per pixel and the available field - of - view was 5.3@xmath67.3 .",
    "the telescope was tracked at sidereal rates owing to temporary failure of the keck guider control software .",
    "we secured two sets of images simultaneously in the b - band ( @xmath19=4370   and @xmath20=900  ) and r - band ( @xmath19=6800   and @xmath20=1270  ) filters , with exposures of 25 s and 20 s for the first set and 250 s and 200 s for the second set , respectively .",
    "we used the first set because the comet was trailed due to the sidereal tracking in the second set .",
    "the sky above mauna kea was photometric .",
    "the last observation for v1 was carried out on ut 2011 march 29 with the 2.0-m ritchey - chrtien hct located at 4500 meters in the himalayan region , india .",
    "it is operated by the indian astronomical observatory , the indian institute of astrophysics , ( iia ) .",
    "we employed the himalaya faint object spectrograph ( hfosc ) @xmath21 pixel ccd camera with @xmath17-band filter ( @xmath19=6550   and @xmath20=1450 ) at the f/9 cassegrain focus of the telescope .",
    "the image scale on the camera was 0.296  per pixel and the available field - of - view was @xmath22 .",
    "the observation was conducted in a crowded region of stars at the galactic longitude and latitude of 354.4   and -1.5 .",
    "we could not detect the comet with the hct but used these data to place an upper - limit to the brightness .",
    "the raw images were reduced in the standard manner for ccd data .",
    "the bias data were obtained at intervals throughout each night .",
    "we used median - stacked data frames to construct flat - field images with which to correct for pixel - to - pixel variation in ccd response and vignetting .",
    "flux calibration was obtained using standard stars in the landolt catalog when available @xcite , otherwise we used field stars listed in the usno ",
    "b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "we employed wcstools to transform ccd pixel coordinates into celestial coordinates @xcite .",
    "the estimated astrometric accuracy was about 0.4 , which is good enough to argue the position angle and morphology of dust structure in the following section . to remove cosmic rays and background objects such as galaxies and stars in iao and hct data",
    ", we followed a technique described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the technique is useful only when a number of exposures were acquired . for the keck - i image",
    ", we did not delete stars because only one set of exposures was available .",
    "figure [ fig : color_image ] shows a false - color composite image taken on ut 2010 november 9 . in the figure , we assigned a @xmath16-band image to the blue color , a @xmath17-band image to the green color , and an @xmath18-band image to the red color , respectively . at a glance",
    ", the comet has a whitish color suggesting that the intensity distribution is similar among these three bands .",
    "we derived the apparent magnitudes of the entire cloud on ut 2010 november 9 as @xmath16=10.14@xmath10.13 , @xmath17=9.53@xmath10.14 , and @xmath18=9.33@xmath10.14 .",
    "in addition , we measured the color of near - nucleus dust within an aperture of 1  in radius on 2011 january 30 using keck - i images and derived @xmath3=0.93@xmath10.25 .",
    "the color indices of the cloud , @xmath0=0.61@xmath10.20 and @xmath2=0.20@xmath10.20 on november 9 , and @xmath3=0.93@xmath10.25 on january 30 , are consistent with those of the sun , that is , ( @xmath0)@xmath23=0.65 @xcite , ( @xmath2)@xmath23=0.33 , and ( @xmath3)@xmath23=1.00 @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to think that scattered sunlight by dust particles accounted for a large fraction of the flux in the cloud .",
    "careful investigation enables us to find subtle differences between images taken in different filters .",
    "based on inspection of the spectra of other comets , we assumed that the observed @xmath18-band intensity is wholly due to dust continuum , and then extracted a signal from other filters associated with emission lines from gaseous atoms and molecules excited to fluorescence by sunlight .",
    "figure [ fig : subtract_image ] shows the differential images on ut 2010 november 9 .",
    "we forced a match to the brightness level of the observed envelope in each band in order to subtract the dust continuum .",
    "the comparison shows a spherical cloud in the @xmath16-band image , centered on the nucleus .",
    "this cloud was not clear in @xmath17-band ( less than a few percent of dust continuum ) .",
    "spherical structures are often detected in comets , where they are attributed to c@xmath24 ( 45004800 , 49005200 , and 53005600 ) and nh@xmath24 ( 49005000 , @xmath55200 , @xmath55400 , @xmath55700 , and @xmath56000 ) @xcite .",
    "for the subsequent analysis , we used the @xmath17-band images because they are more sensitive than @xmath18-band images while remaining less contaminated by gaseous emission than are @xmath16-band images .",
    "as mentioned above , the optical image showed a unique morphology of the dust cloud consisting of an envelope , a near - nucleus coma , and a tail ( see figure [ fig : color_image ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : time_image ] shows the time - series @xmath17-band images of v1 from ut 2010 november 9 to ut 2011 march 29 .",
    "note that the smudge - like features in figure [ fig : time_image ] ( c)(e ) are artifacts of off - axis scattered light from venus .",
    "the envelope was clear in the first image ( figure [ fig : time_image](a ) ) , hardly visible in the second image ( figure [ fig : time_image](b ) ) , and undetectable after the third day of our observation .",
    "on the other hand , the near - nucleus coma and the tail persisted until ut 2011 february 4 ( figure [ fig : time_image](a)(h ) ) .",
    "finally , nothing was detected on ut 2011 march 29 ( figure [ fig : time_image](h ) ) .",
    "we show the predicted position of the comet in figure [ fig : time_image](h ) using nasa / jpl s horizons ephemeris generator .",
    "no object brighter than 20.0 mag was detected . assuming the geometric albedo of 0.04 ( typical of comets )",
    ", we determined an upper limit of the nuclear radius at @xmath251850 m.    in figure [ fig : time_image ] , we see that the orientation of the tail changed with time .",
    "to measure the position angles of the tail , we first applied the larson ",
    "sekanina filter @xcite in order to enhance fine - scale structures .",
    "we obtained profiles perpendicular to the projected orbit by averaging over 15100 pixels parallel and 13 pixels perpendicular to the orbit .",
    "to each profile we fitted a gaussian function .",
    "we then fitted a linear function to the peak of the gaussian versus the distance from the nucleus .",
    "the slope and root - mean - square of the slope give us the position angle of the tail and the corresponding error bars @xcite .",
    "we plot the position angles as a function of the observed time ( figure [ fig : pa ] ) .",
    "we initially compared these position angles with that of the anti - sun vector ( the extended sun to comet radius vector as seen in the plane - of - sky ) , but found that the observed position angles significantly deviated from the anti - sun vector .",
    "in addition , we compared them with synchrones , that is , the loci of dust particles emitted at specific dates with zero ejection velocity . in figure",
    "[ fig : pa ] , it is clear that synchrones reproduce the position angles over the full range of dates observed , consistent with impulsive , rather than continuous , emission of dust . specifically , we found best - fitting synchrone dates in the range from ut 2010 october 31 to november 3 .",
    "these dates are consistent with a reported non - detection by mr .",
    "ikeya on november 1.8 , one day before discovery of the comet on november 2.8 @xcite .",
    "we conclude that an outburst occurred on v1 between ut 2010 october 31 and",
    "november 2.8 , and most likely between november 1.8 and 2.8 . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we adopt ut 2010 november 2 as the time of outburst , after confirming that uncertainties in this date by up to 2 days do not materially change the interpretation below .",
    "the near - nucleus coma was visible as an approximately circular dust cloud .",
    "we obtained aperture photometry to study the material close to the nucleus with the aim of monitoring the comet s continued activity after its explosion .",
    "the photometry was performed using the _ apphot _ package in iraf , which provides the magnitude within synthetic circular apertures projected onto the sky .",
    "we used apertures of fixed physical radius at the comet .",
    "a circular aperture of projected radius 15,000 km was used , corresponding to angular radii 8.912.3 .",
    "the apertures were large enough to be unaffected by seeing variations from night to night .",
    "table 2 lists the measured @xmath17-band magnitudes , @xmath26 .",
    "we represent the absolute magnitude ( i.e.  the magnitude at a hypothetical point at unit heliocentric distance and observer s distance and at zero solar phase angle ) , by :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the observer s distance and the heliocentric distance in au , @xmath30 is the phase coefficient and @xmath31 is the solar phase angle in degree .",
    "we used @xmath32 mag deg@xmath4 as determined from measurements of other comets @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : mag ] shows the absolute @xmath17-band magnitude of the dust coma as a function of time after ut 2010 november 2 ( i.e.  the day of the explosion ) .",
    "we show an upper limit from the last data taken with hct . in the figure",
    ", we did not subtract the contribution to the flux from the nucleus .",
    "this contribution is unknown but probably negligible compared with dust cloud .",
    "we see that the coma magnitude decreased by @xmath55 magnitude ( a factor of @xmath5100 ) over @xmath580 days .",
    "the fading rate of v1 ( @xmath50.06 mag day@xmath4 ) is slightly slower but approximately consistent with that of 17p / holmes ( 0.08 mag day@xmath4 when measured through a small photometry aperture , 2500 km , @xcite ) .    to understand the magnitude profile in figure [ fig : mag ] , we contrived a simple free expansion model in which dust particles expanded at a constant speed without any acceleration . in the model",
    ", we assumed that dust particles reached the projected aperture radius of our photometry ( i.e.  15,000 km ) throughout our observation . to validate the assumption",
    ", dust particles should have the initial speed @xmath3325 m s@xmath4 to reach the projected radius on ut 2010 november 9 ( we justify the assumption of the ejection speed in the following section ) .",
    "the number density of the cloud within the 15,000 km sphere decreases inversely with the cube of elapsed time . on the other hand , the length along the line - of - sight increases in direct proportion to elapsed time . as the result , the total number of particles within the 15,000 km sphere decreases as the inverse square of elapsed time .",
    "it suggests that the magnitude of the dust coma within the fixed physical radius can be described as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the elapsed time and @xmath36 is a constant .",
    "we draw the line of @xmath34 in figure [ fig : mag_comp ] adjusting @xmath36 .",
    "for comparison , we plot photometric results for 17p / holmes also obtained with a circular aperture of projected radius 15,000 km ( table [ tab:17pphotometry ] ) .",
    "the 17p / holmes data were acquired at kiso observatory with the 2kccd camera attached to the 1.05-m schmidt telescope , and obtained from the public data archive , smoka .",
    "although it is a crude model to describe the free expansion and there could be complicating factors such as dust disaggregation @xcite and sublimation of icy grains @xcite as well as acceleration by solar radiation pressure , the fading trend is well matched by the free expansion model .",
    "we conclude that the bulk of the dust in v1 was ejected impulsively .",
    "for a better understanding of the unique morphology on ut 2010 november 9 , we created model images of v1 based on a dynamical theory of dust grains .",
    "the dynamics of dust grains are determined both by the ejection speed ( @xmath37 ) and by the ratio of radiation pressure acceleration to solar gravity ( @xmath38 ) . for spherical particles ,",
    "@xmath38 is given by : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the particle radius and the mass density in the _ mks _ system , and @xmath42 = 5.7 @xmath6",
    "10@xmath43 kg m@xmath44 is a constant .",
    "@xmath45 is a radiation pressure coefficient the value of which depends on grain size , shape , structure and the optical constants of the grain material @xcite .",
    "we applied a three - dimensional analysis to match the observed images , following the model in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we adopted a power - law function for the terminal speed of ejected dust particles :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the reference ejection speed of particles having @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the power index of the ejection speed . in a real comet",
    "the ejection speed will depend not only on @xmath38 but also on the location of the dust source on the nucleus , on the shape and porosity of the dust particles and perhaps on the ejection time within the outburst .",
    "the random variable @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) reflects these uncertain factors .",
    "it follows the gaussian probability density function , @xmath51 ,    @xmath52 ,    \\label{eq : eq5}\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the standard deviation of @xmath50 . in our computations",
    ", we limited the range @xmath54 in order to avoid very fast particles .",
    "in addition , we set the minimum ejection speed to zero .",
    "the number of dust particles at a given size is written :    @xmath55    in the size range of @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath40 @xmath57 @xmath58 , where @xmath56 and @xmath58 are minimum and maximum particle size given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , and @xmath61 is the power - index of the differential size distribution .",
    "we imposed several constraints on the model .",
    "first , we considered that all dust particles were released impulsively on ut 2010 november 2 , neglecting the possibility of weaker dust ejection before and after this date .",
    "this assumption is supported by our synchrone analysis and by the coma photometry as described above .",
    "secondly , we supposed that ejected dust particles are compact in shape and can be represented by @xmath45 = 1 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for optically large ( 2@xmath621 , where @xmath630.64   is the wavelength ) particles but is not strictly valid for optically small particles ( @xmath640.20.3 ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the dust mass density was assumed to be @xmath41=1000 kg m@xmath65 .",
    "we also assumed that the dust particles were ejected symmetrically with respect to the sun ",
    "comet axis in a cone - shaped jet with a half - opening angle @xmath66 , implying that the explosion occurred around the subsolar point of the nucleus .",
    "finally , we assumed that , for particles of all sizes , the geometric albedo is 0.04 and the phase coefficient is @xmath30 = 0.035 mag deg@xmath4 .",
    "we examined several key properties with which to constraint our dust model from the observed images .",
    "we noticed that the envelope has a more open shape in the anti - solar direction meaning that the width of the envelope was enlarged by increasing ejection speeds even as the envelope was stretched by the solar radiation pressure .",
    "because smaller particles are more susceptible to radiation pressure , the envelope morphology suggests that small particles were ejected with higher speeds ( see figure 3 and 4 ( a ) ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) , we can derive the power index of the ejection speed for the particles in the envelope , @xmath49=@xmath67/@xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the apparent width of the envelope ( proportional to the ejection speed projected on the celestial plane ) .",
    "we examined the width and the corresponding @xmath38 values from the image taken on 2010 november 9 , finding that @xmath49=0.30@xmath10.05 best fits the observed broadening of the envelope .",
    "separately , we found that the envelope did not extend more than @xmath54.5  in our data .",
    "particles with @xmath712.5 should have spread to the edge of the field of view in the time since ejection , while particles with @xmath721 would not match the observed extent . through a test simulation for hemispherical ejection model ( e.g. reach et al .",
    "( 2010 ) section 6.1 ) , we obtained @xmath731.5 . in the image on february , there is no obvious gap between the dust tail and the inner coma . from the evidence ,",
    "we put the upper limits of @xmath74 @xmath51@xmath610@xmath65 .",
    "model images were produced in a monte carlo simulation by solving kepler s equation including solar gravity and radiation pressure .",
    "we derived the above parameters to fit the surface brightness of the dust cloud on ut 2010",
    "november 9 , where prominent features ( the envelope , tail and coma ) were detected .",
    "we created a number of simulation images using a wide range of parameters as listed in table [ tab : parameter ] , and fitted the image from the outer parts to the inner parts . a two - component ( i.e.  envelope and tail+coma ) model worked well for the fitting .",
    "we selected 20 sampling points in the envelope and found the optimum parameter sets first ( envelope model ) .",
    "then we subtracted the best - fit envelope model from the observed intensity , and selected 25 sampling points in the residual image , and derived the best - fit parameters to fit the tail and coma surface brightness ( tail+coma model ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : parameter ] .",
    "we tolerate intensity differences between the model and observation of up to 10% , and derived the errors in the table .",
    "figure [ fig : model_image ] shows the comparison between the observation and model .",
    "we produced the model contour through further tuning of the best - fit parameters within the error range .",
    "the distinctive morphology of the dust cloud is successfully reproduced by this two component model .",
    "the best - fit parameters suggest that the envelope consists of small particles ( @xmath38=0.51.8 or @xmath40=0.31 ) with ejection speeds higher than in the coma and tail .",
    "the reference speed of particles in the envelope was @xmath47=420@xmath130 m s@xmath4 . with the range of @xmath75 , the ejection speed of the envelope particles turned out to be 290500 m s@xmath4 , where we adopted @xmath53=0 to derive the typical speed .",
    "on the other hand , the tail and coma consisted of a wide range of dust particles from sub - micron to sub - millimeter ( @xmath38=1@xmath610@xmath651.5 or 0.4570 ) in size .",
    "their ejection speeds are estimated to vary from 7390 m s@xmath4 .",
    "the effective radius , @xmath76 , of dust particles in the coma is given by @xmath77 = 15 .",
    "the ejection speed of 15 -particle is 52@xmath13 m s@xmath4 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) , which is fast enough to reach the projected radius of 15,000 km during the time of our observation .",
    "this explains why the free expansion model can characterize the observed magnitude profile ( section [ sec : free_expansion ] ) .",
    "we obtained the power index of @xmath38-dependence of the ejection speed , @xmath49 = 0.30@xmath10.05 in the envelope and 0.55@xmath10.10 in the tail and coma .",
    "given the uncertainties , it is not clear that the difference between these estimates is formally significant .",
    "we note that the value @xmath78 0.5 is expected of dust particles accelerated by gas drag forces @xcite . the moderate slope for the envelope particles may suggest that small particles may be largely accelerated to reach the gas velocity .",
    "we deduced the total mass of dust and the total kinetic energy by integrating with respect to particle size , as summarized in table [ tab : summary ] .",
    "the total dust mass is @xmath79=5.1@xmath610@xmath80 kg . with uncertainties in dust size ( @xmath56 and @xmath58 ) and its power index ( @xmath61 ) as well as the photometric error ( @xmath26 ) , the derived mass is good to within a factor of four .",
    "the dust mass corresponds to a body 62-m in radius assuming mass density of @xmath81=500 kg m@xmath65 .",
    "this is @xmath330.004 % of the mass of a @xmath82 1850 m spherical body ( the upper - limit of the nuclear radius ) .",
    "the total kinetic energy is @xmath83 = 5.0@xmath610@xmath8 j , or 1.2 kiloton of tnt , with the bulk of the energy carried by the tail and coma particles .",
    "presumably , a comparable or larger energy was carried by gas in the initial explosion .",
    "the energy per unit mass is @xmath84 1@xmath610@xmath9 j kg@xmath4 .",
    "the value is similar to that of 17p / holmes @xcite and is about 10% of the energy released by the crystallization of amorphous water ice ( 9@xmath610@xmath9 j kg@xmath4 ) .",
    "the ejected mass could be contained in a surface layer on the nucleus having thickness ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ,    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the fraction of the surface area of the nucleus that is ejected .",
    "we obtained @xmath66 = 3035   to an accuracy of @xmath510  from our model simulations , which suggests that the active area exists within @xmath8730   from the sub - solar point .",
    "the area of the inferred active region is 2.9@xmath610@xmath88 m@xmath89 , corresponding to @xmath86=0.07 .",
    "substituting these values gives @xmath900.35 m. the ejected mass could be contained within a circular patch of the nucleus surface roughly 1 km in radius and 35 cm thick .",
    "here we examine the orbital evolution of v1 to attempt to understand its recent history .",
    "dynamical chaos imposes a fundamental limit to our ability to backwards - integrate the motion of any comet ; a small error in the initial conditions will grow exponentially on the lyapunov time .",
    "there is additional uncertainty from the ( generally poorly known ) non - gravitational acceleration , which is induced in comets by recoil forces from the sublimation of ice .",
    "the non - gravitational parameters of v1 are not known . in the case of v1 , there is in addition a relatively large uncertainty in the orbital elements because these were necessarily determined from observations taken over a short interval ( only 80 days ) .    to investigate the past orbit",
    ", we consider many ` clones ' , whose initial orbits follow a gaussian distribution with the average values and the standard deviations provided by the nasa / jpl horizons site ( table [ tab : orbital_elements ] ) . then the clone orbits are calculated and examined statistically .",
    "we generated 1,000 clones of v1 using the n - body integration package , mercury @xcite , and calculated the orbital evolution over the past 10,000 years .",
    "we set the non - gravitational force equal to zero .    figure [ fig : orb_evo ] shows the orbital evolution of five sample clones .",
    "they follow almost identical orbits for about 100 years before present epoch , with perihelion fixed near 1.6 au .",
    "their tisserand parameters drop below 3 and become jupiter - family comets within 100200 years .",
    "thus , v1 is likely to be a jupiter - family comet which originated in the kuiper - belt region .",
    "comets generally become active within @xmath252.5 au owing to sublimation . we examined the fraction of v1 clones which existed within 2.5 au as visible comets .",
    "we found that all the v1 clones had perihelion @xmath912.5 au over the last 100 years , dropping to 74% over 1,000 years and 19% in 10,000 years . on this basis , it is clear that v1 is unlikely to be a new comet making its first appearance at small heliocentric distances .",
    "therefore , the non - detection of v1 before 2010 is either a result of sky - survey incompleteness ( unlikely , given the brightness of the comet ) or a reflection of much reduced activity in previous orbits .",
    "we conjecture that , until the outburst on 2010 november 2 , activity on the nucleus was largely stifled by a dust mantle , leading to low brightness and the non - detection of v1 .      like v1 , 17p / holmes was discovered ( in 1892 ) because of a dramatic outburst .",
    "another outburst , in 2007 , was well observed , revealing a spherical envelope , a detached blob , and a central coma ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "total ejecta mass was estimated to be ( 1@xmath5610)@xmath610@xmath92 kg @xcite .",
    "the expansion speed on the plane of the sky of the dust envelope particles was 554@xmath15 m s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "several other comets are known to have undergone huge photometric outbursts accompanied by circular envelopes .",
    "for example , 41p / tuttle - giacobini - kresak experienced an outburst at 1.15 au , and , before fading underwent second outburst at 1.25 au from the sun .",
    "it possessed an envelope ( probably consisting of dust and gas @xcite ) expanding at 300 700 m s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "1p / halley experienced a massive explosion in 1836 at 1.44 au from the sun .",
    "similarly , 1p / halley was enclosed by a circular envelope consisting of dust particles traveling at a speed of 575@xmath19 m s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "only 17p / holmes and v1 were observed with modern astronomical instruments ( i.e.  ccd ) and the others were observed by photographic plates or naked eyes .",
    "we summarize the physical quantities of the outburst events at 17p / holmes and v1 in table [ tab : comparison ] .",
    "although the magnitudes and heliocentric distances are different , the maximum speeds are similar to one another .",
    "figure [ fig : speed ] shows the comparison between the 2010 v1 event ( this work ) and the 2007 17p / holmes event @xcite .",
    "the dust size was not specified in @xcite and @xcite , but we regard it as sub - micron particles ( i.e.  0.3@xmath93 ) because only such small particles can be accelerated to the highest velocity and remain as sensitive scatterers in optical observations .",
    "@xcite provided the speeds for three different populations ( core , blob and shell ) .",
    "although the total dust mass and the kinetic energy of these two events are different , the size  speed relationships are quite similar to one another .",
    "several possible mechanisms have been presented to explain 17p / holmes outburst ; these include vaporization of pockets of more volatile ices such as co@xmath94 and co @xcite , the phase change of water from amorphous to crystalline ice @xcite , thermal stress in the nucleus , or the polymerization of hydrogen cyanide @xcite .",
    "a plausible trigger is the crystallization of amorphous water ice @xcite . from table [",
    "tab : comparison ] , most of large - scale outbursts occurred after their perihelion passages , suggesting that a time - lag from conducted heat might trigger these outbursts .    the heat diffusion equation can be solved to give the distance over which heat can be transported by conduction , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the thermal diffusivity of the surface materials and @xmath97 is the period of time over which conduction acts @xcite .",
    "the applicable thermal diffusivity in comets is uncertain , depending on the unknown porosity of the material .",
    "insulating solids typically have @xmath98 10@xmath99 m@xmath89 s@xmath4 while @xmath100 to @xmath101 m@xmath89 s@xmath4 maybe more appropriate for comets in which porous structure reduces the contact area between grains @xcite .",
    "if , as seems likely from the clone experiments , v1 has spent @xmath102100 yr inside 2.5 au , conducted heat would reach a depth @xmath103 3 to 10 m beneath the initial surface . since @xmath104 ( equation [ eq : eq7 ] ) , it is quite plausible , although far from proved , that the outburst was triggered by the action of conducted heat through the crystallization of buried amorphous ice .",
    "from our research on v1 , we find the following .    1 .",
    "several observations show that v1 underwent an explosive ejection in late 2010 .",
    "the changing position angle of the dust tail is closely matched by synchrone trajectories for ejection dates between ut 2010 october 31 and november 3 .",
    "the near - nucleus coma faded steadily at @xmath50.06 mag day@xmath4 , distinct from any steady - state behavior .",
    "the non - discovery of this nearby , bright comet before 2010 is naturally explained by the outburst interpretation .",
    "the v1 dust cloud had two distinct components .",
    "the envelope consisted of small grains ( radii 0.31 ) expanding at a maximum speed of 500@xmath140 m s@xmath4 .",
    "the tail and coma were composed of a wider range of dust particles ( radii 0.4570 ) and expansion speeds of 7390 m s@xmath4 .",
    "the ejecta mass in solids is 5.1@xmath105 kg and the kinetic energy is 5.0@xmath610@xmath8 j. although the mass and energy are orders of magnitude smaller than in 17p / holmes , the energy per unit mass ( @xmath51@xmath610@xmath9 j kg@xmath4 ) is similar . 4 .   the sudden ejection and the derived energy per unit mass of the ejecta are consistent with runaway crystallization of buried amorphous ice as the source of energy to drive the outburst .     + we would like to express our gratitude for vigorous activity and prompt reactions by amateur astronomers network .",
