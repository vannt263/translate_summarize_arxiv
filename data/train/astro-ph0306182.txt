    "our data ( fig .  [ fig_colormag ] ) suggests a less steep color - magnitude relation than seen in the nearby coma cluster .",
    "this effect is likely due to a blue agn contribution to the brightest galaxy in our group , .",

    "the lack of extended x - ray emission coupled with the spectroscopically - confirmed @xmath134 galaxies with a tight color - magnitude relation lead us to interpret  to be a protocluster in the process of formation .",

    "a weak icm is probably already in place , with some metal enrichment from previous generations of stars , but it remains undetected since  is not virialized and the ( future ) icm s temperature and density are far too low to produce detectable x - ray emission . as noted previously ( lubin , oke , & postman 2002 ) , many optically - selected clusters at @xmath135 are also underluminous in the x - rays when compared to the x - ray luminosity  velocity ( @xmath136 ) relation for local and moderate - redshift clusters .",
    "this suggests that clusters are actively forming at these redshifts .    accepting that  is a cluster in the process of formation , we note that the old age of the  member galaxies (  3.3 ) implies that the stars in clusters are older than the icm .",
