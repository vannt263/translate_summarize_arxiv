    "through the mechanism of andreev reflection@xcite , a normal ( non - superconducting ) material in contact with a superconductor acquires superconducting phase coherence between its particle and hole wave functions , even though the pairing interactions vanish in this normal material .",
    "the associated superconducting correlations give rise to a finite value of the pair amplitude , @xmath0 .",
    "this is known as the proximity effect .",
    "the proximity effect occurs also , in a modified way , if the non - superconductor is a ferromagnet . in this case ,",
    "@xmath1 exhibits spatial oscillations . on the other hand ,",
    "the pair potential itself , @xmath2 vanishes in the ferromagnet in the absence of attractive coupling . for conventional isotropic superconductors ,",
    "@xmath3 is spatially independent , and corresponds to the minimum excitation energy in the spectrum , or the energy gap , @xmath4 . for ferromagnet - superconductor systems , as in other inhomogeneous cases",
    ", @xmath5 depends on position , while the excitation gap for the whole system , @xmath4 , obviously does not .",
    "the proximity effect can therefore result in @xmath4 and @xmath3 possessing a rather nontrivial relationship . in this paper",
    "we study this question for ferromagnet - superconductor ( f / s ) bilayers .",
    "several works involving nonmagnetic normal metal - superconductor heterostructures have discussed in various contexts , the presence or absence of an energy gap in the excitation spectrum.@xcite for a normal metal layer of width greater than the coherence length in the superconductor , @xmath6 , but smaller than the phase coherence length @xmath7 , the appearance of a minigap of order of the thouless energy has been reported , while if the normal layer is smaller than @xmath6 , the induced gap is of order @xmath3 .",
    "it was found that while interface roughness plays a role , the minigap persistence depends chiefly upon interface quality.@xcite these conclusions draw upon the results of calculations carried out within the quasiclassical formalism , which is applicable when certain conditions are satisfied .",
    "the main results are modified if the normal metal region is modeled as a non - fermi liquid , where increased electron correlations may inhibit or completely destroy the minigap altogether.@xcite    for f / s structures , the magnetic exchange field in the ferromagnet results in quasiparticle spin splitting , and consequently the pair amplitude rapidly decays and oscillates over a characteristic length scale @xmath8 , in which electron - hole pairs remain coherent .",
    "this modulation in phase of the pair amplitude has been shown to induce corresponding oscillations in the local density of states ( dos).@xcite impurities in the magnet were shown to play a significant role in the determination of thermodynamic quantities.@xcite for ballistic f / s structures , the tunneling dos for clean ferromagnet layers has been calculated for a wide range of exchange fields,@xcite and the local dos has been found to exhibit a gapless state for all positions in the magnet.@xcite configurations consisting of weak or thin ferromagnetic layers where @xmath9 , may lead to significantly different results,@xcite as we shall see below .",
    "the finite geometry can result in the quasiparticle amplitudes undergoing coherent andreev and normal reflection ( at the ferromagnet - insulator interface ) in such a way that the minimum value of the excitation spectrum is nonzero due to the relatively slow characteristic decay of the pair amplitude .",
    "thus , a gap develops . associated with this , when the dimensions of the ferromagnet are reduced to a scale comparable to @xmath8 , the greater confinement of the pairing correlations in the ferromagnet restricts the pair amplitude so that it no longer changes sign , and the dos does not exhibit the corresponding oscillations .",
    "it is generally accepted that the quasiclassical and dirty limit equations are satisfactory for studying many aspects of inhomogenous superconductivity . if however , the ferromagnet has dimensions of order of or smaller than the elastic mean free path @xmath10 , so that quasiparticles undergo very few scattering events , the problem is more suitably solved within the ballistic regime .",
    "furthermore , the inherent geometrical effects associated with ferromagnet layers only a few atomic spacings thick require a full microscopic theory that does not coarse - grain over length scales of order of the fermi wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "another constraint imposed upon the quasiclassical approximation is exhibited by the andreev@xcite equations , whereby values of the quasiparticle momentum parallel to the interface , and comparable to the fermi momentum , are crudely approximated .",
    "we will see below that in fact these quasiparticle states play a prominent role in the determination of the gap threshold for f / s systems .",
    "thus , we examine here the electronic spectrum of f / s bilayers and investigate under what conditions an energy gap can exist in such structures .",
    "the problem will be solved within the framework of the _ self - consistent _ solutions of the bogoliubov de - gennes@xcite ( bdg ) equations .",
    "we will calculate self - consistently the dos , and excitation spectra of a thin ferromagnet film adjoining a bulk superconductor .",
    "this microscopic approach complements existing quasiclassical theories and serves to round the current knowledge .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the method and geometry used in our model . in sec.[results ] , the influence of the interface transparency , the magnitude of the exchange field , and the mismatch in fermi levels on the energy gap and local dos , will be presented .",

    "the planar interface is at @xmath16 , and the free surfaces at @xmath17 and @xmath18 are specularly reflecting . upon taking into account the translational invariance in the semi - infinite @xmath19 plane ,",

    "we take the quantity @xmath28 to equal @xmath29 in the magnetic side , so that @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , while in the superconducting side , @xmath32 . from the symmetry of the problem , the solutions for the other set of wavefunctions @xmath33 are easily obtained from those of eqns .",

    "we introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath40 to characterize the barrier strength , with @xmath41 , and the measure of mismatch between the fermi levels is given by the ratio @xmath42 .",
    "the requirement of self - consistency in the problem excludes the possibility of an analytical solution .",
    "the bdg equations ( [ bogo1],[bogo2 ] ) are therefore solved numerically using the approach@xcite outlined in the appendix .",
    "we assume the low temperature regime ( we take @xmath43 ) , and a superconducting coherence length @xmath6 of @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the fermi wavevector of the superconductor .    the energy gap , @xmath4 , is the minimum binding energy of a cooper pair , and its existence will influence various thermodynamic measurements , including heat capacity and thermal conductivity .",

    "as the ferromagnet layer grows , @xmath4 decays monotonically towards a gapless superconducting state , at a rate that depends strongly on the strength of @xmath51 . in the limit of zero exchange field ( normal metal )",
    ", the gap ceases to exist when @xmath52 .",
    "this thickness at which @xmath4 is destroyed is much smaller than the proximity length characterizing the usual very slow decay of the pair amplitude in the metal.@xcite this trend continues for finite @xmath51 , with @xmath4 vanishing much more rapidly than the characteristic decay length of the pair amplitude in the magnet . to illustrate this ,",
    "recall@xcite the approximate expression for the characteristic length of decay of the pair amplitude in the ferromagnet : @xmath53 , which can be rewritten as , @xmath54 thus for example , the @xmath55 curve in fig .",
    "[ gap ] shows the energy gap vanishing at @xmath56 , while the pair amplitude decays over the larger length scale @xmath57 .",

    "this result is typical of what we find for other exchange fields , the only difference being the value of @xmath4 [ see fig .  [ gap ] ] .",
    "it is therefore those excitations with a dominant momentum component parallel to the interface , that are significant in contributing to the filling in of the gap . in the andreev or quasiclassical approximation scheme ,",
    "these quasiparticles have `` trajectories '' which are not treated accurately , and those with @xmath71 are neglected altogether .",

    "next we consider the effect that an interface barrier or fermi energy mismatch has on the electronic structure .",

    "[ dos2 ] illustrates a small but finite number of states centered about the fermi level .",
    "although the quasiparticle spectrum has just turned gapless for @xmath91 , and @xmath89 , the dos signature is substantially different , the most prominent feature being the larger number of subgap bound states for @xmath91 , which can be attributed to the larger fermi energy mismatch , and subsequently , increased normal reflections .",

    "the self - consistent quasiparticle spectra reveals that the gap onset is due to quasiparticle states with a large momentum component parallel to the interface .",
