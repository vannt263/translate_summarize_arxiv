    "an interest in quantum properties of the scattering problem that describes an impact of a particle on a black hole was inspired by the discovery of the penrose process @xcite , and the works of zeldovich @xcite and misner @xcite devoted to the energy extraction from the kerr black hole .",
    "first numerical results for scattering of scalar particles on rotating black holes were presented by press and teukolsky @xcite .",
    "the analytical solution of the scattering problem , which had a strong influence on further developments , was found by starobinsky @xcite for the scalar field and starobinsky and churilov @xcite for electromagnetic and gravitational waves scattered by the rotating kerr black hole .",
    "independently , unruh @xcite considered scattering of scalar and fermion particles on schwarzschild black holes .",
    "further study of the scattering problem was presented by sanchez @xcite .",
    "after these and the numerous works that followed , it has been assumed that the scattering problem is completely understood , see details and bibliography in the books .",
    "the present work discusses particular aspects of the scattering problem related to quantum phenomena , which take place strictly on the event horizon of black holes .",
    "the important relevant effects in this area are the hawking radiation @xcite , and the unruh process @xcite .",
    "the hawking radiation is associates with the entropy of black holes , which , according to bekenstein @xcite , equals the area of the horizon . for a review of the hawking radiation and",
    "the thermodynamics properties of black holes see refs . @xcite and @xcite . the hawking radiation can be treated as a tunneling process ,",
    "see e.g. parikh and wilczek @xcite , khriplovich @xcite , and khriplovich and korkin @xcite and references therein .",
    "another line of research on quantum phenomena aims at quantization of energy levels of black holes , see discussion in bekenstein @xcite and references therein .",
    "treatment of a number of different quantum phenomena on the event horizon can be found in the review by t hooft @xcite which , among other issues discusses the brick wall model of ref .",
    "@xcite , aimed at explanation of the entropy of black holes .",
    "the effect of the hawking radiation can be considered in terms of the influence that the horizon exercises on the vacuum of the theory .",
    "it has been realized recently that quantum events on the horizon have also a strong impact on the wave function of a particle that approaches a black hole @xcite . as a result there arises a new qualitative feature in the scattering problem . a particle approaching the black hole can bounce on its event horizon back into the outside world .",
    "this phenomenon , which is referred to below as the reflection on the horizon ( rh ) using the terminology of @xcite , is due to pure quantum reasons ; in the classical approximation it is obviously absent .",
    "the rh effect , which is strong when the wavelength of the particle exceeds the radius of the event horizon , reduces the absorption cross section , making it zero in the infrared region , as was demonstrated explicitly in ref.@xcite for scattering of low - energy scalar massless particles on schwarzschild black holes .",
    "this behavior of the cross section differs qualitatively from the result of unruh @xcite , which stated that this cross section equals the area of the horizon .",
    "@xcite argued that similar reduction of the cross section is expected for scattering of any massless particle by any black hole in the low energy limit .",
    "recent ref .",
    "@xcite gives a brief summary of progress related to the rh .",
    "refs.@xcite suggested several arguments in favor of the rh .",
    "however , all of them , one way or another , were related to eternal black holes , inspiring a question as to whether the phenomenon exists for collapsing black holes as well , or is merely a peculiar feature relevant to eternal black holes only .",
    "the present work shows that the rh does take place for collapsars being thus a common effect for black holes .",
    "let us formulate briefly and in general terms the main idea of this work . consider a quantum system characterizes by a set of coordinates @xmath0 , which include the time variable ;",
    "generally speaking this set may be infinite .",
    "take some quantum state of this system , not necessarily stationary , which is described by the wave function @xmath1 .",
    "assume now that there is some discrete symmetry that characterized the system , calling the operator that generates this symmetry @xmath2 .",
    "it suffices to restrict out presentation to the simplest case , when the symmetry group is @xmath3 , i.e. the symmetry group is generated by the only operator @xmath2 , which satisfies @xmath4 .",
    "( though more general symmetries can also be covered by the method discussed , they will not play a role in the present work . ) since @xmath2 is a symmetry , the function @xmath5(q)$ ] necessarily describes some physically allowed state of the system .",
    "let us consider now the complex extensions of the coordinates @xmath0 , using the analytical continuation for constructing the wave function @xmath1 for the complex - valued coordinates .",
    "take some closed contour @xmath6 that runs in the multidimensional space of the complex coordinates @xmath0 .",
    "[ zero ] gives a schematic presentation for this contour .",
    "the contour starts and finishes at some real physical point @xmath0 .",
    "generically , the wave function @xmath1 should have a sufficiently complex riemann surface that possesses some singularities ; the cuts attached to them give access to different sheets of the riemann surface .",
    "correspondingly , the value of the wave function depends on the sheet of the riemann surface where it is taken .",
    "thus , if the contour @xmath6 crosses some cut that separates two sheets of the riemann surface , called @xmath7 and @xmath8 in fig .",
    "[ zero ] , then after returning to the initial physical value of @xmath0 the wave function acquires a new value , call it @xmath9 .     into",
    "the complex - valued coordinates @xmath0 .",
    "the contour @xmath6 goes from the sheet @xmath7 of the riemann surface over the cut to another sheet @xmath8 . as a result the wave function changes from @xmath1 into @xmath10.,height=94 ]",
    "assume now that one is able to verify that the analytical continuation along the contour @xmath6 and the symmetry transformation with the operator @xmath2 have one and the same influence on the system .",
    "then one can say that @xmath11 ( q)=\\tilde \\psi(q)~.       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equality is derived from the initial wave function @xmath1 by the symmetry transformation , which is implemented on the left - hand side directly , while on the right - hand side it works through the analytical continuation .",
    "one concludes from this that eq.([psipsi ] ) provides a symmetry condition on @xmath1 .",
    "eq.([psipsi ] ) is based on the relation between a monodromy transformation ( analytical continuation ) and a discrete symmetry of the system , which generally speaking is a well known method . to mention some result derived with its help one can remember the known seiberg - witten solution for the @xmath12 supersymmetric theory ref.@xcite .",
    "the system discussed in this work consists of collapsing matter and an incoming probing particle .",
    "the relevant discrete symmetry of the system is the time inversion , which transforms the collapsing matter ( black hole ) into an expanding matter ( white hole ) , and at the same time forces the incoming particle to become the outgoing one .",
    "we will see in section [ wave ] that eq.([psipsi ] ) puts a restriction on the wave function of the particle , deriving from it that the rh really takes place .",
    "this section summarizes briefly several important for us , though well known facts related to the collapse of the dust matter , i. e. matter without pressure , @xmath13 , see books @xcite for details . for simplicity",
    "let us take the spherically symmetrical case when the collapse can be described by the tolman metric @xmath14 which is a function of @xmath15 , the radial variable @xmath16 , and angular variables @xmath17 ; @xmath18 .",
    "the functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined by the einstein equations , which give for them @xmath21 here and below the dotted and primed functions indicate derivatives over @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the two functions @xmath22 provide the initial conditions for the spherically symmetrical dust matter .",
    "one of them , namely @xmath23 , defines the density of matter @xmath24 @xmath25 the total mass of matter inside a sphere with the radius @xmath16 equals @xmath26 the integrand here has no additional factors of @xmath27 or @xmath28 due to the defect of mass caused by gravity .",
    "eq.([mass ] ) shows that @xmath23 can be considered as the gravitational radius for the mass of matter accumulated inside the sphere of radius @xmath16 , @xmath29 .",
    "another function @xmath30 , which appears in the formulation of the problem , gives an additional parameter that is needed to define the distribution of velocities of the matter given by eq.([rdot ] ) .",
    "the two functions @xmath31 will be presumed to satisfy conditions @xmath32 eqs.([condi1 ] ) are necessary to make @xmath27 and @xmath33 positive , whereas eqs.([condi2 ] ) exclude crossings of different spherical shells of the collapsing matter , which simplifies discussion .",
    "each shell of matter is characterized by some value of @xmath16 , which remains constant during the collapse @xmath34 integrating eq.([rdot ] ) when eq.([r = c ] ) holds one finds the explicit relation that defines the radius vector @xmath20 of the shell of matter @xmath35 here @xmath36 is an arbitrary function of @xmath16 .",
    "the sign minus in front of the integral in eq.([tau ] ) indicates that all velocities of the collapsing matter are negative , @xmath37 . a fixed value of @xmath16 in eq.([tau ] )",
    "prompts a shortcut notation @xmath38 , @xmath39 , which is also used below .",
    "if one changes the sign in front of the integral in eq.([tau ] ) , then the metric in eq.([metric ] ) describes the exploding matter i.e. the white hole , which plays a significant role below .    in the particular case , when @xmath40 the tolman metric eq.([metric ] ) represents the metric of eternal black holes .",
    "to see this clearly , one can choose @xmath41^{3/2}$ ] , finding that @xmath42^{3/2}$ ] .",
    "then eq.([metric ] ) reduces to the lemaitre metric @xmath43 further transformation of variables @xmath44 @xmath45 converts the lemaitre metric to the schwarzschild metric @xmath46 which explicitly describes a static eternal black hole .",
    "let us introduce a complex structure associated with the tolman metric eq.([metric ] ) .",
    "the angular variables @xmath17 would not play a role below because we restrict discussion to the spherically symmetrical case . our aim is to generalize the radial motion , allowing the radial variables to acquire complex values .",
    "it is sufficient to keep @xmath16 real , allowing only @xmath33 and @xmath15 to become complex - valued .",
    "it suffices also to assume that the classical equations of motion for matter eqs.([r = c]),([tau ] ) hold ; in other words , we consider here the analytical continuation of the geodesics for the collapsing matter .",
    "eq.([tau ] ) allows one to take one of the variables @xmath47 as an independent variable , and treat the other one as its function .",
    "the conventional approach ( which was followed above ) takes @xmath33 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "however , it is more convenient here to assume that @xmath15 is a function of @xmath33 , @xmath48 , see fig .",
    "this choice allows one to keep connection with the case of eternal static black holes , where the time variable does not play a role and the analytical continuation is applied to @xmath33 , see section [ et ]",
    ".     possesses the cut of the squareroot nature that connects the points @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "similar cut exists for the action @xmath51 of the probing particle . additionally , the action has the logarithmic singularity on the horizon @xmath52 with the corresponding cut attached .",
    "the analytical continuation along the contour @xmath6 generates the time inversion eq.([t - t ] ) for the collapsing matter ; additionally , it results in transformations eqs.([sin - out]),([sout - in ] ) for the action of the probing particle.,height=151 ]    obviously the function @xmath53 presented by the integral in eq.([tau ] ) can be expressed via elementary functions , but it is more instructive to derive its analytical properties directly from eq.([tau ] ) . on the complex plane",
    "@xmath33 the integral in eq.([tau ] ) has two singular points , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which match singularities of the radical @xmath54 in the integrand .",
    "this makes @xmath53 an analytical function of @xmath33 , which has a cut on the complex plane @xmath33 that runs between the two singular points @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "[ one ] shows this cut running over the section @xmath55 of the real axis . using the analytical continuation over this cut",
    "one constructs the riemann surface for this function .",
    "the singularities at @xmath49 and @xmath50 are of the squareroot nature .",
    "therefore the riemann surface includes two riemann sheets .",
    "let us assume that the initial real physical values of @xmath33 and @xmath15 belong to the outside region , i. e. @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "starting from this point one can continue the function @xmath53 along the contour @xmath6 that crosses the cut and then returns to the initial physical value of @xmath33 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ one ] . under this transformation ( usually called a monodromy )",
    "the function is transformed as @xmath58 here the sign minus arises due to the squareroot nature of the crossed cut .",
    "the term @xmath59 in eq.([t - t ] ) is a constant , which depends on @xmath60 in eq.([tau ] ) .",
    "since @xmath60 is real , @xmath59 is also real and can be absorbed in the shift of the origin of time .",
    "eq.([t - t ] ) shows that the analytical continuation described results in the inversion of the time variable .",
    "the equations of motion of the collapsing matter under this continuation become equations of motion for the expanding matter .",
    "speaking plainly , this analytical continuation transforms a black hole into a white hole .",
    "consider motion of a probing particle in the metric eq.([metric ] ) created by the collapsing matter .",
    "it suffices to restrict discussion to the simplest case of a pure radial motion of the massless scalar particle , i.e. to choose the spin @xmath61 , orbital momentum @xmath62 , and mass @xmath63 of the particle to be all zero , @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding classical action is a function of @xmath16 and @xmath15 only , @xmath65 . the hamilton - jacobi equations of motion @xmath66 , which follow from eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) in this case , have a simple form @xmath67 here @xmath38 ; @xmath33 is defined in eq.([tau ] ) as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath15 , @xmath20 ; the signs plus and minus correspond to the outgoing and incoming trajectories respectively .",
    "eq.([taur ] ) is formulated in terms of the initial variables @xmath68 of the tolman metric .",
    "it is convenient now to look at the problem from another perspective , considering @xmath47 as independent variables and assuming that @xmath57 is a function defined by the geodesics eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) .",
    "one easily finds that @xmath69 where @xmath70 . differentiating eq.([tau ] ) , while keeping either @xmath71 , or @xmath72 , one finds also that @xmath73 using eqs.([part1]),([part2 ] ) and ( [ rr ] ) one rewrites eq.([taur ] ) in a more convenient form @xmath74 where @xmath75 and the function @xmath76 is defined as @xmath77 the signs plus and minus here match the signs in eq.([taur ] ) , the variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 are both functions of @xmath47 since it is presumed that @xmath57 .    to clarify the physical meaning of the factor @xmath76 in eq.([tr ] )",
    "it is convenient to use the canonical formalism introducing the hamiltonian @xmath78 and the momentum of the particle @xmath79 @xmath80 where the last identity follows from eq.([tr ] ) .",
    "then from eq.([ham ] ) and the canonical equations of motion one finds that @xmath76 equals the velocity of the particle @xmath81 which makes eq.([tr ] ) convenient for the following discussion .",
    "let us discuss an analytical continuation of the variables , which describe the radial motion with zero orbital momentum of the scalar massless probing particle .",
    "this task is similar to the one dealt with in section [ riemann ] , where the analytical continuation was applied to the collapsing matter .",
    "however the study of the probing particle will be more detailed . in section [ riemann ]",
    "we discussed the analytical continuation assuming that the equations of motion are satisfied ( i.e. assuming that eqs.([r = c]),([tau ] ) are valid ) . for the probing particle discussed here the analytical continuation of the action of the probing particle",
    "is considered .",
    "this presumes that the classical equations of motion for this particle are not necessarily valid .",
    "the classical action presents a particular interest since it allows one to construct the semi - classical wave function , see section [ wave ] .",
    "since the variables @xmath47 are not presumed to satisfy the equations of motion , the action @xmath82 that describes the radial motion is a function of two independent variables .",
    "an analytical structure associated with this function for complex values of both variables is too sophisticated for our purposes .",
    "it is desirable therefore to simplify the problem forcing the action to be a function of only one complex variable .    with this in mind",
    "let us adopt the following approach .",
    "first , take some arbitrary real physical values for @xmath47 , call them @xmath83 and @xmath84 . then find a real physical @xmath16 that satisfies classical equations of motion for the collapsing matter eqs.([r = c]),([tau ] ) .",
    "in other words , find a shell of matter labeled by @xmath16 , which at the moment @xmath85 is located at the radius - vector @xmath60 .",
    "this makes @xmath16 a function of the chosen physical variables @xmath86 .",
    "after that let us fix the found value of @xmath16 and allow @xmath33 and @xmath15 to take only particular complex values that satisfy eq.([tau ] ) .",
    "thus , the described procedure presumes that the complex values of @xmath47 satisfy the classical equations of motion ( [ tau ] ) for matter .",
    "the complex radius vector @xmath33 of the particle follows the complex extension of the geodesics . under this condition",
    "the complex - valued @xmath15 can be taken as a function of the complex - valued @xmath33 , @xmath48 . at the same time",
    ", there is no restriction on real physical values of @xmath87 ; they remain two independent physical variables .",
    "the procedure outlined ensures that during the analytical continuation the action remains a function of only one complex variable @xmath33 , @xmath88 , which simplifies its analytical properties .",
    "there exist , obviously , a variety of other ways to put some restriction on complex values of @xmath33 and @xmath15 making @xmath15 a function of @xmath33 , and thus forcing the action to be a function of one variable .",
    "an advantage of the procedure adopted here is that it matches the motion of matter , which follows the geodesics .",
    "this fact will allows one to combine results for the analytical continuation of the motion of the matter and probing particle .",
    "it becomes clear below that the horizon plays an important role in the analytical structure of the action .",
    "anticipating this feature one can presume that the physical values of @xmath87 are chosen close to the event horizon , i. e. the following condition is fulfilled @xmath89 where @xmath16 is a function of @xmath87 as described above .",
    "this means that at the moment @xmath85 the shell marked by @xmath16 is close to its horizon as well .",
    "the subscripts in @xmath87 are suppressed below ; it is to be clear from the context whether real physical values of the variables @xmath47 , or their complex extensions are discussed .",
    "eq.([w ] ) defines @xmath76 as a function of @xmath47 . following the procedure adopted , i. e. taking @xmath90",
    ", one makes @xmath76 a function of @xmath33 only .",
    "then eq.([w ] ) shows explicitly that on the complex plain @xmath33 this is a regular function with a squareroot - type cut from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "this function takes the values @xmath91 and @xmath92 on the two sheets of the corresponding riemann surface .",
    "it is convenient to label these sheets as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and call them the sheet of outgoing particles , and the sheet of incoming particles respectively ( keeping in mind that the velocities satisfy @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) .",
    "since the action @xmath82 is a solution of eq.([tr ] ) , which is governed by @xmath76 , it necessarily exhibits properties similar to @xmath76 .",
    "this means that it is an analytical function , which possesses the cut of the squareroot nature from @xmath49 to @xmath50 on the complex plane @xmath33 , taking the values @xmath97 and @xmath98 on the two sheets of the riemann surface . here",
    "@xmath99 is defined on the sheet @xmath93 and describes the outgoing motion , while @xmath100 is located on @xmath94 and is related to the incoming motion of the particle .",
    "let us discuss now the second important feature of the action , which is related to the node of the function @xmath76 .",
    "eq.([w ] ) shows that this node is located on the horizon @xmath101 on the sheet @xmath93 of the riemann surface , which corresponds to the outgoing motion with @xmath102 .",
    "this singularity of eq.([tr ] ) enforces singular behavior on the action .",
    "the derivative @xmath103 on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) represents the hamiltonian , which is certainly positive @xmath104 for all physical values of @xmath105 in the outside region @xmath106 .",
    "it remains therefore nonnegative on the horizon @xmath107 .",
    "one concludes that the derivative @xmath108 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tr ] ) exhibits a pole - type behavior on the horizon @xmath109 here the residue is @xmath110 as it follows from eq.([w ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath111 in eq.([pole ] ) denotes the hamiltonian of the particle on the horizon . from eq.([pole ] ) one finds that the action itself has a logarithmic singularity on the horizon @xmath112 we see that the analytical structure of the function @xmath51 on the complex plane @xmath33 is defined by two features shown in fig .",
    "there is a cut from @xmath49 to @xmath50 that connects the two sheets @xmath93 and @xmath94 of the riemann surface where the action takes the values @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively .",
    "additionally , there is the logarithmic singularity eq.([log ] ) , which is located on the horizon being present on the sheet @xmath93 .",
    "consider now the transformation of the action when it is continued along the contour @xmath6 in fig .",
    "the reasons inspiring to choose this contour for the analytical continuation are discussed below . to be specific",
    "let us take the action that describes the incoming trajectory @xmath113 .",
    "correspondingly the contour @xmath6 starts on the sheet @xmath94 of the riemann surface that corresponds to the incoming particles and , after crossing the cut over @xmath55 , ends up on the sheet @xmath93 of the outgoing particles .",
    "combining the transformations arising from both the cut on the segment @xmath55 and the logarithmic singular point @xmath101 , see fig .",
    "[ one ] , one concludes that the analytical continuation over the contour @xmath6 results in the following transformation of the action @xmath114 two features are to be noted here .",
    "first , the negative sign in front of @xmath99 , which is related to the crossing of the cut ; the squareroot nature of this cut makes this sign inevitable .",
    "second , there is the imaginary part in the right - hand side , which arises due to circling around the logarithmic singular point over the angle @xmath115 counter clockwise .",
    "it adds @xmath116 to the logarithmic function , forcing through eq.([log ] ) the imaginary constant @xmath117 to appear in the transformation of the action . generally speaking",
    ", there may exist also an additional real additive constant in the right - hand side of eq.([sin - out ] ) , but its calculation is not pursued here , since it is not important for our purposes .",
    "in contrast , the imaginary term plays a prominent role below .",
    "similarly the analytical continuation over the contour @xmath6 for the action @xmath99 results in the transformation @xmath118 the negative sign in front of the imaginary part is due to the fact that the logarithmic singularity in this example is circled in the clockwise direction .    in section [ riemann ] the analytical continuation that transforms",
    "the equations of motion for collapsing matter into equations of motion of the expanding matter was found .",
    "the results of the present section are in line with this finding .",
    "the actions for incoming and outgoing particles transform one into another in eqs.([sin - out]),([sout - in ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to specify the approach of section [ collapsar ] for the simplest possible case , when both functions @xmath119 , which govern the collapse are constants @xmath120 this condition , which incorporates the physically interesting case of the eternal schwarzschild black holes eqs.([f=0]),([schw ] ) , indicates that @xmath76 defined by eq.([w ] ) is a function of only one variable @xmath33 , which allows to integrate eq.([tr ] ) explicitly @xmath121 here @xmath122 is the energy of the particle .",
    "the sign minus in front of the integral in eq.([int ] ) is related to negative velocities of the collapsing matter @xmath37 , compare eq.([tau ] ) .",
    "the explicit integral representation eq.([int ] ) allows one to verify that the action possesses the analytical structure shown in fig .",
    "namely , on the complex plane @xmath33 there exists a cut from @xmath50 to @xmath49 , which connects the two sheets @xmath93 and @xmath94 of the riemann surface . on the sheet @xmath93",
    "there exists an additional logarithmic singularity .",
    "it arises from the node in the integrand in eq.([int ] ) , being located on the horizon @xmath123 these facts confirm what is known from a more general approach of section [ collapsar ] .",
    "one also re - derives eqs.([sin - out]),([sout - in ] ) specifying that for eternal black holes @xmath124 in eq.([aaa ] ) is a constant @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the hawking temperature .",
    "consider the scalar massless particle that moves with the zero orbital moment in the gravitational field of a collapsar , describing its propagation in the semiclassical approximation with the help of the wave function @xmath127 here @xmath128 are the two actions that are related to the incoming and outgoing trajectories .",
    "correspondingly , the first term in eq.([psi ] ) describes the incoming wave , while the second one represents the outgoing wave .",
    "the wave function eq.([psi ] ) can be used to describe the process of absorption of particles by the black hole . in this case",
    "one needs to consider the behavior of this wave function on the horizon of each shell , i.e. to presume that @xmath47 satisfy condition @xmath129 ( which is similar to eq.([hori ] ) ) .",
    "eq.([rff ] ) has a clear physical meaning .",
    "it states that there is a shell of matter characterized by some particular value of @xmath57 , which at the moment of time @xmath15 has the radius vector @xmath33 that is close to the horizon of this shell @xmath23 .",
    "same can be rephrased as a statement that the amount of dust matter that is accumulated inside the sphere of radius @xmath33 at the moment @xmath15 is close to a critical value , which is necessary to create a black hole . generically ,",
    "as the time passes on each shell converges to its own horizon @xmath23 ( eventually crossing it ) .",
    "therefore there exists a set of critical values @xmath130 of the radius vector that are located in an interval @xmath131 ; if @xmath33 is close to any such critical value , then one can always choose @xmath15 to to satisfy eq.([rff ] ) .",
    "for static black holes the set of critical radiuses degenerates to the only value of the schwarzschild radius @xmath132 .",
    "conventional wisdom prompts one to assume that in the vicinity of the horizon there should be no reflected wave ; whatever comes close to the horizon must be absorbed , simply because we deal with a black hole , the object that is presumed to be _ absolutely _ black .",
    "thus , one could anticipate that the second term in eq.([psi ] ) is absent , i.e. the factor @xmath133 , which we will call the reflection coefficient , is zero , @xmath134 . )",
    "is written in the semiclassical approximation . in regions where the semiclassical approach fails",
    "the second term in the wave function is definitely present , describing the flux of particles scattered by those parts of the gravitational potential that violate the semiclassical conditions . in relation to the hawking radiation this phenomenon",
    "is often referred to as the grey body effect ; for low energy particles it takes place at large distances from a black hole .",
    "in contrast , in the close vicinity of the horizon one should expect the semiclassical method to work well ( as can be easily verified for eternal black holes ) .",
    "the appearance of the second term here would indicate the reflection on the horizon . ]",
    "the absence of the reflected wave on the horizon , often called the matzner condition in the stationary problems , see the references in the book @xcite , played a fundamental role in the scattering problem ; it was used in the pioneering refs .",
    "@xcite as well as in numerous subsequent developments related to the scattering problem .",
    "it turns out , however , that the reflection coefficient proves be nonzero @xmath135 , the second term is present in eq.([psi ] ) on the horizon . in other words",
    "there is the rh , as was shown in @xcite for eternal black holes .    in order to verify this claim for",
    "the collapsing case let us apply the method outlined in section [ main ] , which culminates in eq.([psipsi ] ) for the wave function @xmath1 of the quantum system .",
    "the system considered here includes the collapsing dust matter plus the incoming probing particle",
    ". however , quantum treatment is necessary only for the particle , as the dust matter is much less affected by quantum effects .",
    "this happens because the quantum effects prove strong only for low energies of a particle that approaches the horizon ( see eq.([r ] ) below ) , while each drop of the collapsing dust can be considered as a heavy particle that has high energy associated with its mass .",
    "anticipating this fact from the very beginning , one can describe the matter in the pure classical approximation , taking quantum effects into account only in the wave function of the particle @xmath136 .",
    "thus , eq.([psipsi ] ) needs to be reformulated in terms of the wave function @xmath136 of the particle , which moves in the given time - dependent metric produced by the collapsing matter .",
    "as the first step in this direction , let us use the contour @xmath6 shown in fig .",
    "[ one ] for the analytical continuation .",
    "firstly , using this contour one continues analytically the equations of motion eqs.([r = c]),([tau ] ) for each shell @xmath16 of the dust matter , converting the equations for the collapsing matter into equations of the expanding matter ( converting the black hole into the white hole ) .",
    "the way to do this was described in detail in section [ riemann ] . secondly ,",
    "using same contour @xmath6 one can fulfill the necessary transformation of the wave function of the particle . using eqs.([sin - out]),([sout - in ] ) for the classical action one finds that this operation can be written as a transformation of the wave function @xmath137 , where @xmath138 here @xmath139 is governed by the imaginary constant in the transformation of the action ( [ sin - out]),([sout - in ] ) @xmath140 where @xmath124 is defined in eq.([aaa ] ) , while the phases @xmath141 are related to the real constants in the transformation of the action , which were omitted in ( [ sin - out]),([sout - in ] ) .",
    "clearly , the first main term in eq.([psi1 ] ) describes the outgoing wave , indicating that this wave function describes the creation of the particle .",
    "this is a sensible result since the analytical continuation transforms the matter into the white hole , as discussed above .",
    "the white whole is able to create particles .",
    "thus , the considered analytical continuation leads to the time inversion .    since the time invariance is valid , one is certainly free to fulfill the inversion of time directly in the equations of motion . by applying the inversion of time to the classical equations of motion for the dust matter one brings them back to the collapsing case .",
    "the inversion of time leads also to the complex conjugation of the wave function of the particle , i.e. to the transformation @xmath142 thus the inversion of time can be fulfilled in two different ways .",
    "either by the analytical continuation , resulting in eq .",
    "( [ psi1 ] ) , or it can be done directly in the equations of motion , which leads to eq.([psi2 ] ) . since these two ways should give the same physical result , the wave functions in eqs.([psi1]),([psi2 ] ) should be the same , or at worst differ by some phase factor .",
    "one derives from this @xmath143 this equality presents a restriction on the wave function of the particle , which stems from the symmetry related to the time inversion ( compare eq.([psipsi ] ) , which was written in general terms ) . from definitions of the wave functions",
    "( [ psi]),([psi1 ] ) and eq.([sym ] ) one derives that the reflection coefficient is necessarily nonzero @xmath144 thus , the invariance under the time inversion eq.([sym ] ) makes the process of the rh inevitable , the horizon is able to reflect the incoming particles .",
    "derivation of eq.([sym ] ) was based on a particular contour on the complex plane @xmath33 shown in fig .",
    "this contour must necessarily cross the cut that connects the sheets @xmath93 and @xmath94 of the riemann surface , thus leading to the time inversion in the equations of motion of the matter eq.([t - t ] ) and transformation of the wave function eq.([psi1 ] ) . the chosen way of curling around the logarithmic singularity leads to a sensible result , @xmath145 in eq.([r ] ) , while the opposite direction of circling around this singularity would result in the violation of unitarity @xmath146 .",
    "such dependence of the result on the contour is common in semiclassical problems , see the book @xcite .",
    "eq.([r ] ) shows that the rh really takes place , the horizon reflects particles .",
    "our main result is presented in eqs.([psi]),([r ] ) , which show that the wave function of the particle approaching the black hole horizon has a component that describes the reflected wave . in other words ,",
    "the particle can bounce on the horizon back into the outside world . according to eq.([r ] )",
    "the probability of this effect equals @xmath147 where the parameter @xmath124 is expressed in eq.([aaa ] ) via the functions @xmath148 , which define the collapse . their argument",
    "@xmath57 depends on the coordinates @xmath47 of the wave function . additionally , @xmath124 depends on the hamiltonian of the particle @xmath149 , which is taken on the horizon . the expression for @xmath124 simplifies in the limit of the static schwarzschild black hole , @xmath150 when eq.([gh ] ) is valid . in this case eq.([p ] ) reduces to @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the hawking temperature eq.([th ] ) .",
    "eq.([ps ] ) coincides with the result of @xcite derived exclusively for the static case .",
    "eq.([ps ] ) shows that the reflection is strong for low energy particles @xmath153",
    ". in other words , in the low energy limit the horizons of black holes act as mirrors .",
    "it is interesting to compare the symmetry condition eq.([sym ] ) with a similar condition found for the stationary case in @xcite .",
    "the latter works focused on the wave function of the particle , leaving aside the effect of the discussed transformation on the collapsing matter .",
    "this simplified the consideration , but raised several qualitative questions .",
    "first , the symmetry , as it was derived in @xcite , was formulated in terms of regions i and iii of the kruskal plane @xcite ( definitions of regions follow @xcite ) .",
    "however , one could argue that the collapsing black hole moves from region i into ii , and does not come across region iii .",
    "it was unclear therefore whether the proposed symmetry condition would hold for collapsing black holes .",
    "second , there are known several ways to define the topological correspondence between regions i and iii , see refs .",
    "@xcite . refs .",
    "@xcite suggested to use a particular correspondence ( the most obvious ) , postponing a question of whether the symmetry condition remains valid for all other possible ways of the topological correspondence .",
    "the symmetry transformation in the present work is discussed from a broader perspective ( in addition to the fact that a more general collapsing case is considered ) .",
    "the inversion of the time is discussed in relation to both the wave function of the probing particle , and the motion of the matter .",
    "this point of view enables one to formulate simple physical answers for the mentioned problems .",
    "first , the inversion of the time variable not only brings the particle to region iii , but it also transforms the collapsing matter into the expanding white hole , thus making region iii relevant to the matter as well .",
    "second , for any sensible topological correspondence between regions i and iii the operation of the time inversion remains a symmetry of the space - time .",
    "this symmetry guarantees that the presented approach remains applicable for any topological identification between these regions .",
    "the rh can be considered as a manifestation of the logarithmic singularity , which the action exhibits on the event horizon . at the same time",
    "the classical trajectories do not come across this singularity ( as one easily verifies using fig .",
    "[ one ] ) .",
    "therefore the singularity has no influence on the classical equations of motion , being important only in the action .",
    "this property of the problem has a similarity with the aharonov - bohm effect , as was mentioned in @xcite in relation to the case of eternal black holes .",
    "earlier a similarity that exists between physical events in the vicinity of the horizon and the aharonov - bohm effect was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is shown that the reflection on the horizon of black holes is a general phenomenon , which manifests itself for the collapsing case as well as for eternal black holes .",
    "one of interesting consequences of this fact is related to the information paradox .",
    "since any incoming wave can bounce on the horizon back into the outside world , the horizon can not destroy completely all the incoming information , at least part of it inevitably returns into the outside world ."
