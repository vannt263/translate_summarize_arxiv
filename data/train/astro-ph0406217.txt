    "highly luminous quasars at high redshift require the formation of black holes ( bh ) with a mass @xmath8 large enough to make the observed luminosity be less than the eddington limit .",
    "this may pose a problem for cold dark matter ( cdm ) models where massive halos that can harbor bhs do not form until late epochs @xcite .",
    "currently , the highest redshift quasar known is sdss 1148 + 3251 , at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "its luminosity @xmath9 , if equated to the eddington value @xmath10 , results in a minimum bh mass @xmath11 @xcite . the quasar luminosity inferred from the observed",
    "flux is not likely to be greatly overestimated due to gravitational lensing or beaming @xcite .",
    "if bhs grew in mass by accretion through a standard thin disk with radiative efficiency @xmath12 , then a bh of initial mass @xmath13 formed at time @xmath14 accreting continuously up to time @xmath15 with luminosity @xmath9 will reach a final mass @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the salpeter time @xcite , @xmath18 note that the factor @xmath19 in the denominator is to account for the fact that only a fraction @xmath19 of the accreted mass is added to the bh .",
    "since the age of the universe at @xmath3 is @xmath2 years , a bh made by one of the first stars formed in the universe with @xmath20 would need to be accreting near the eddington rate for almost all the time available before @xmath3 in order to increase its mass by a factor @xmath21 to power the observed quasars ( corresponding to @xmath22 e - folding times ) .",
    "there are several ways to ease this requirement and allow bhs to grow to a large mass in less time : ( a ) bhs may have started at a higher initial mass from the collapse of supermassive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( b ) there may be super - eddington accretion with @xmath23 years if the radiative efficiency is @xmath24 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or the luminosity is greater than the eddington luminosity with @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "( c ) finally , several bhs may have merged to form a more massive bh .    in this paper",
    "we consider the latter possibility in the context of the cdm model , where dark matter halos merge hierarchically .",
    "if the earliest bhs arose from the first stars forming in the center of halos , then halo mergers can lead to the merger of their central bhs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , after dynamical friction leads to the formation of a binary bh which can then lose orbital energy by interacting with stars @xcite or via gas dissipation @xcite , until the emission of gravitational waves takes over . if many bhs growing from initial stellar seeds of mass @xmath26 made at time @xmath27 continuously accrete until time @xmath15 ( as they merge with each other at any intermediate times ) , the final bh can reach a mass @xcite , @xmath28    in the last stage of the merger of bhs , the emission of gravitational waves ( gw ) can give a net momentum to the resulting bh large enough to eject it from its halo @xcite .",
    "then the halo center is left empty and the process of bh growth must start over again .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a calculation of the growth of bh masses assuming that they start growing from stellar seeds only when the halo has a velocity dispersion @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a fixed kick velocity given to the bhs by the final gw burst .",
    "@xcite concluded that for @xmath31 , bhs would not be able to grow to large enough masses without super - eddington accretion .",
    "= 3.5truein    we show in this paper that when the adequate kick velocity as a function of the mass ratio and spins of the two merging bhs is used , and a halo escape velocity based on an isothermal profile ( higher than assumed by haiman ) is used , ejections by gw emission result in a smaller reduction than found by @xcite of the final black hole mass that is attained . as a result",
    ", we shall show that bh masses of @xmath32 can be reached up to @xmath33 without super - eddington accretion , even for the highest plausible kick velocities found by @xcite .",
    "our model for the bh evolution and growth is described in   2 .",
    "the main results are presented in   3 , and we discuss the implications in   4 .",
    "we model the evolution of dark matter halos using the merger tree of @xcite based on the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "we use the flat @xmath34cdm power spectrum @xcite with matter density @xmath35 , baryon density @xmath36 , present hubble constant @xmath37 , power spectrum normalization @xmath38 , and primordial index @xmath39 , consistent with the wmap results @xcite .",
    "we start the merger tree at @xmath0 with a final halo mass @xmath40 , finding all the progenitor halos at higher redshift .",
    "the mass @xmath40 is determined by requiring the quasar number density @xmath41 @xcite to be equal to the number density of halos of mass @xmath40 at @xmath0 .",
    "this gives the maximum possible mass of the host halo of the quasar consistent with the observed quasar abundance ( for example , if quasars have a short duty cycle the host halo abundance must be higher than the quasar abundance , so the halo mass must be lower ) .",
    "the resulting halo mass , @xmath42 @xcite , requires a @xmath43 fluctuation at @xmath0 .",
    "the first bhs are assumed to form in halos that have reached a virial temperature @xmath44  k , when molecular hydrogen cooling induces the formation of the first stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a constant initial bh mass @xmath13 is assumed in every halo reaching this virial temperature .",
    "the mass corresponding to this virial temperature , @xmath45 , is chosen as the resolution of the merger tree . in order to accurately follow the appearance and growth of halos down to mass @xmath46 , we compute accretion into halos of mass @xmath47 from smaller halos down to a minimum mass @xmath48 or @xmath46 , whichever is smallest .",
    "we compute the virial temperature of halos , related to velocity dispersion as @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath51 is the mean particle mass ) , using the fitting formula of @xcite for the mean overdensity of virialized halos @xmath52 , and the equations @xmath53 , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the radius of virialization of the halo and the critical density at a given redshift @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "= 3.5truein    we assume that all the bhs grow continuously by gas accretion on the timescale @xmath17 obtained with @xmath58 and @xmath59 , after their host halo has reached a minimum velocity dispersion @xmath60 .",
    "we shall show some results for @xmath61 , in which case bhs start growing as soon as they are formed .",
    "alternatively , the effects of slow gas cooling , stellar winds , or supernovae may prevent any gas concentrating in the halo center and being captured by the bh for accretion when @xmath62 .",
    "the bh growth by gas accretion continues until the bh mass reaches a fraction @xmath63 of its halo mass , at which point we simply set @xmath64 .",
    "the last step is to check if the bh merger results in an ejection from the host halo .",
    "we consider four estimates of the gw recoil velocity .",
    "the first is a quasi - newtonian calculation of non - spinning bhs by @xcite .",
    "second , @xcite added a post - newtonian spin - orbit correction to fitchett s work that depends on the bh spins .",
    "lastly , @xcite and @xcite obtained a new estimate using bh perturbation theory , and they provided a lower and upper limit on the gw kick velocity comprising the uncertainty due to the final plunging state which gives the dominant contribution ( see their eqs .  [ 1 ] ,  [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we use these limits as two separate estimates .",
    "the mass acccretion histories of bhs are calculated following the merger trees in time and computing the gw recoil velocity every time two halos merge ( and by assumption , their central bhs merge ) .",
    "the dimensionless spin parameters of merging bhs are uniformly chosen from antiparallel ( @xmath65 ) to parallel ( @xmath66 ) in relation to the orbital angular momentum , to calculate the effective spin parameters @xcite .",
    "we then compare the gw kick velocity with the escape velocity of the halo to decide if the merged bh is ejected .",
    "we compute the escape velocity assuming the halo has an isothermal profile , with density @xmath67 down to the radius of the bh zone of influence : @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the escape speed at @xmath69 is @xmath70 , or about @xmath71 when @xmath72 .",
    "note that haiman ( 2004 ) assumed instead that @xmath73 , and that no bhs start growing until the halo escape velocity has exceeded an assumed , fixed gw kick velocity .",
    "the exact value of the escape velocity depends on the halo density profile , but it would not be much lower than we assume for a profile similar to observed galaxies .",
    "gravitational waves emission also implies that a fraction of the mass in bhs is lost as the energy of the waves .",
    "this loss of energy does not greatly reduce the final bh mass @xcite , and we neglect it in this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the mass history of the bh in the @xmath0 quasar sdss  1148 + 5251 in our models .",
    "the upper thick solid line shows the mass of the main halo progenitor in one realization of the merger tree , obtained by always choosing the branch of the most massive progenitor at every merger .",
    "the lower four lines show the mass of the bh in this main halo progenitor , according to our four different prescriptions for the gw kick velocity . the mass of the seed bhs is fixed at @xmath74 , and they start growing by gas accretion immediately as they are formed , over a time @xmath75 years . at every halo merger",
    ", the mass of the two bhs is added when the gw kick velocity is smaller than the escape velocity .",
    "this results in the sudden bh mass increases seen in the figure .",
    "growth by gas accretion is assumed to continue immediately after mergers .",
    "when the gw kick velocity exceeds the escape velocity , the bh is removed and replaced immediately with a new seed with @xmath76 .",
    "the figure shows that bhs are often kicked out at high redshift when they reside in low - mass halos , but this stops when the halo reaches a high enough escape velocity .",
    "large , sudden mass increases ( for example , at @xmath77 for the kidder curve ) are due to additions of bhs that have grown to high mass in a merging subhalo .",
    "note that the favata lower limit curve reaches a mass @xmath48 ( at which point the bh is not allowed to grow further ) at @xmath78 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows a histogram of the number of bhs that have merged into the final bh at @xmath79 , as a function of their formation redshift ( _ top panel _ ) , and their contribution to the total mass of the final bh ( _ bottom panel _ ) .",
    "in other words , the number shown in the top panel is the number of bhs that we need to add over in equation ( [ eq : bhms ] ) from every interval of bh formation redshift , and the bottom panel shows their contribution to the final mass including the factor @xmath80 .",
    "the figure shows that the final mass attained by the bh at @xmath0 is the result of the merger of many small bhs : the formation redshift bins with the highest contribution to the final bh mass typically contain @xmath81 to @xmath82 seed black holes that merged .",
    "hence , the @xmath21 mass growth factor from the initial seed mass of @xmath83 to the final bh mass of @xmath1 originates in about equal parts from the growth factor @xmath80 of each individual bh , and from the number of similar terms that are added together in equation ( [ eq : bhms ] ) from all the bhs that have merged .    in summary",
    ", these results show that in the optimistic model we have assumed for bh growth , it is possible to reach a mass as high as that inferred for the bh in the quasar sdss 1148 + 5251 at a redshift of up to @xmath78 for the @xcite lower limit of the gw kick velocity . even for the highest gw kick velocities the same bh mass can still be reached at @xmath84 .",
    "= 3.5truein    in figure  [ fig : all ] we examine a number of variations on our basic model . increasing the seed bh mass to @xmath85 ( _ upper left panel _ ) causes a small increase of the redshift at which a mass of @xmath1 can be achieved .",
    "the models in the lower left panel show what happens when growth by gas accretion is allowed only in halos with @xmath86 , since it may seem implausible that bhs accrete at the eddington rate in halos in which the gas can be easily blown out after being photoionized . in this case , the fitchett and kidder models for the gw kick velocities can reach a maximum mass of only @xmath87 by @xmath0 . in the upper right panel ,",
    "we impose an additional requirement : halo mergers will lead to the mergers of their central bhs only if the mass ratio of the two halos , @xmath88 , is between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "otherwise the merging halo is assumed to remain an orbiting satellite ( with too long a dynamical friction timescale for spiraling in ) , so its bh never reaches the center . in this case",
    "the fitchett and kidder models reach a mass of only @xmath91 at @xmath0 , and with the upper limit to gw kick velocities of favata et al .",
    "the required mass of @xmath92 is barely reached , but for the favata et al .",
    "lower limit to the gw kick velocities the required mass can still be reached at @xmath33 .",
    "we also show the result of raising @xmath60 to @xmath93 in the lower right panel , and maintaining the requirement @xmath94 on the halo mass ratio .",
    "this higher limit might be more realistic if central bhs are only fed in galaxies with gravitationally unstable disks and a sufficient star formation rate ( so that the gas does not all settle in a large , quiescent disk ) , and where the gravitational potential is sufficiently deep . even in this case , the favata et al .",
    "lower limit to the kick velocity can produce a bh mass above @xmath92 by @xmath0 , but with higher kick velocities the bh mass that can be reached is too low .",
    "note that in the models of @xcite bhs do not appear at all when @xmath62 , whereas in our model bhs can still form and merge ( but not accrete gas ) for @xmath95 .",
    "this , together with the higher @xmath96 we adopt , explains the difference between haiman s results and ours .",
    "combining a continued mass growth of bhs from eddington - limited gas accretion at high radiative efficiency ( @xmath97 ) with bh mergers , we can still account for the presence of bhs with @xmath98 at @xmath0 , starting from stellar black holes of @xmath83 .",
    "typically , these bhs can form by the merger of @xmath5 stellar bh seeds , growing by a factor @xmath5 in mass by gas accretion .",
    "we have shown that the ejection of some bhs due to gw recoil does not necessarily impede the growth of bhs in halo centers .",
    "our model for the formation of these bhs involves two optimistic assumptions : first , that the bh masses grow by accretion with an e - folding time shorter than @xmath99 years , for most of the time from their birth as stellar black holes at @xmath6 to @xmath100 .",
    "second , that bh mergers in which the recoil velocity is less than the halo escape velocity result in the bh immediately returning to the center and continuing its gas accretion , without significant losses from the energy of the emitted gws .",
    "these two assumptions are highly questionable .",
    "the first one may seem unlikely in view of the small fraction of galaxies that host quasars at lower redshift , although this fraction might be high in the earliest massive halos to form .",
    "regarding the second , a more realistic calculation might show that black holes spend a lot of time finding their way back to the halo center after the gw kick , even when they do not escape the halo @xcite .",
    "the earliest redshift at which a mass of @xmath1 can be reached strongly depends on the value of @xmath101 assumed . making @xmath101 slightly greater than @xmath89 would increase @xmath102 and reduce the number of e - folding times available between the epoch of formation of the first stellar black holes at @xmath6 and the earliest time when",
    "luminous quasars are observed .",
    "this would then make it impossible to attain the required mass . at the same time , that is perfectly possible if black holes gain their mass in a short period of super - eddington accretion , which is in fact the main alternative to the model of continuous eddington - rate growth we have assumed here .    in the absence of super - eddington accretion ,",
    "the scenario of continuous , luminous gas accretion and large numbers of mergers implies that quasars should be strongly correlated at high redshift .",
    "the halo hosting the luminous quasar at @xmath0 should have merged from lower mass halos in the recent past .",
    "for example , in the randomly generated merging history used for the realization shown in figure 1 , the halo mass at @xmath4 is only about one third of its mass at @xmath0 , and several halos of mass greater than @xmath103 merge with the main halo in the intervening time .",
    "most of these halos would need to host their own quasar shining near the eddington luminosity for most of the time , within a distance of the turn - around radius of the halo at @xmath0 ( a few comoving megaparsecs ) .",
    "we are grateful to zheng zheng and adam steed for discussions .",
    "we also thank zheng zheng for the use of his merger tree code .",
