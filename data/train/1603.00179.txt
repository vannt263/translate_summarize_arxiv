    "the study of quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) is a hot topic in different areas of quantum many - body physics . in nuclear physics",
    "many aspects of qpts have been studied @xcite , both theoretically and experimentally . also in other fields such as molecular physics @xcite , quantum optics @xcite or solid state physics @xcite studies related to relevant qpts have been recently presented .",
    "qpts are phase transitions analogous to the classical ones but occurring at zero temperature .",
    "qpts appear when the hamiltonian has two ( or more ) parts with different structures ( symmetries ) and there is one ( or several ) control parameter that drives the system from one structure to the other .",
    "the phase transition is characterized by an abrupt change in an observable ( called order parameter ) that is zero in one phase and different from zero in the other .",
    "the value of the control parameter for which the structural change appears is known as critical value .",
    "schematically a hamiltonian undergoing a qpt is written as @xmath0 for a particular value of the control parameter , @xmath1 , which is the critical value , the system undergoes a structural qpt from symmetry 1 to symmetry 2 .",
    "one interesting extension of the qpt concept appears when treating with composed systems , as in the case of lattice systems @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is a quantum two - fluid system in which there are two kind of particles ( bosons in the case presented here ) with creation ( and annihilation ) operators that commute among them .",
    "some pioneering studies on two - fluid systems @xcite were carried out for the proton - neutron interacting boson model , ibm-2 , and the authors managed to construct the phase diagram for a restricted hamiltonian and classified the different phase transitions that the system undergoes . other models that can be considered as two - fluid systems are the dicke @xcite and the jaynes - cumming @xcite models for which the two fluids correspond to photons and atoms .",
    "note that in this case the role of both fluids is not symmetric , photons fulfill a @xmath2 ( heisenberg - weyl ) algebra while atoms are governed by a @xmath3 algebra . in the case of ibm-2",
    ", both fluids are connected with a @xmath4 algebra .",
    "the aim of this work is to study a simple two - fluid lipkin model , which corresponds to a @xmath5 algebra .",
    "one of the main motivations for carrying out this study is to treat with a model somehow similar to ibm-2 ( except for the @xmath6degree of freedom ) but simpler . in refs .",
    "@xcite , when discussing qpts in ibm-2 , because of the large dimensions involved , exact results ( obtained from a direct diagonalization ) were only obtained for small values of the boson number .",
    "thus , a comparison with the corresponding mean - field results , valid for @xmath7 , was not possible .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to carry out such a comparison for a model with similar physics content than ibm-2 . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the ibm-1 and the lipkin energy surfaces are equal @xcite and then , their phase diagrams are fully equivalent .",
    "the advantage of the two - fluid lipkin model with respect to ibm-2 is the smaller dimensions involved , which allows one to perform exact calculations with much larger boson numbers .",
    "consequently , this study will allow us to establish a proper comparison with the mean - field results .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that dicke and jaynes - cumming models correspond to a given limit of the two - fluid lipkin model , in which a _ contraction _ from @xmath8 to @xmath2 is performed @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - model ] the algebraic structure of the model is outlined , while in section [ sec - cqf ] the particular case of the consistent - q like hamiltonian is worked out .",
    "section [ sec - cl ] is devoted to study the classical limit of the model ( mean field ) . in section",
    "[ sec - numerical ] a numerical study of the phase diagram is presented .",
    "section [ sec - taylor ] is devoted to the application of the catastrophe theory in the study of the phase diagram and the unambiguous determination of the order of the different phase transitions .",
    "finally , section [ sec - conclusions ] stands for the summary and the conclusions .",
    "we consider that @xmath9 and @xmath10 present a different behavior with respect to the parity operator , @xmath28 therefore , @xmath9 bosons preserve the parity while @xmath10 bosons do not , i.e. , @xmath9 has positive parity while @xmath10 has negative one . in @xmath8",
    "this assignment is arbitrary , but in higher - dimensional models appears from physical considerations .",
    "a detailed description of the @xmath27 algebraic structure can be found in @xcite . here , we will present just an abridged version of that analysis .",
    "starting from the dynamical algebra @xmath27 , the possible subalgebras chains are four : two of them correspond to an early coupling of the dynamical algebras into the direct - sum subalgebra @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 & & n_t & \\rightarrow \\textrm{basis } ~~ |n_1~   n_2~ h~ n_t \\rangle \\\\ \\end{array},\\ ] ] where the labels of the irreps verify the following branching rules : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 stands for the basis state in the corresponding dynamical symmetry .",
    "the second two algebras correspond to a late coupling into a direct - sum subalgebra , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , and @xmath43 where @xmath44 .    concerning the hamiltonian , the most general up to two - body interaction hamiltonian",
    "can be written as , @xmath45 where @xmath46 being @xmath47 in an equivalent way the hamiltonian can be expressed as , @xmath48      a more restricted hamiltonian , which is inspired in the consistent - q - formalism of the ibm @xcite , will be used along the rest of the paper .",
    "this hamiltonian resembles the schematic one used in many ibm-2 calculations , it was studied in detail in @xcite and will be the reference hamiltonian in this work .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 due to the behavior of the bosons under parity ( [ parity ] ) , the hamiltonian ( [ hcqf ] ) is in general non - parity conserving , except for @xmath51 .",
    "this hamiltonian ( [ hcqf ] ) can be obtained from the general one ( [ h1],[hi],[h12 ] ) with the following relations among parameters , @xmath52 ( please note that @xmath53 correspond to a shift in the energy origins ) leading to the compact form , @xmath54 this hamiltonian is a mixture of dynamical symmetries of the problem , particularly @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath51 .",
    "this form is specially suitable to study qpts , because one can associate a _",
    "( spherical ) phase to the first term of the hamiltonian and a _ non - symmetric _ ( deformed ) shape to the second term .",
    "moreover , depending on the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 different kinds of deformation are produced .",
    "the study of qpts should be strictly done in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. for an infinity number of particles .",
    "fortunately , this kind of calculation can be easily performed through the use of the mean - field approximation which , indeed , coincides with the exact result in the large particle number limit @xcite .",
    "the mean - field analysis of the model starts considering the product of two boson condensates , one for each fluid , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the boson vacuum and @xmath63 the boson creation operator for the @xmath64 fluid defined as @xmath65 the coefficients @xmath66 and @xmath67 are variational parameters associated to each fluid that , in turn , become order parameters .",
    "the mean - field energy for the consistent - q - like hamiltonian for a symmetric system , i.e. , a system with @xmath68 , in the large n ( @xmath69 ) limit can be written as , @xmath70 with @xmath71 inserting these expressions for @xmath72 in ( [ egs1 ] ) , we get @xmath73 please note that , contrary to the ibm-2 case where for @xmath74 the energy surface is invariant under the transformation @xmath75 , the double lipkin model with @xmath76 is symmetric under the interchange @xmath77 .",
    "it could be also of interest to write down the energy for the non - symmetric case for analyzing how the difference in the relative number of bosons affects the mean - field energy @xmath78 where @xmath79 . along this paper",
    "we will only consider the symmetric case .",
    "in order to study the structure of the two - fluid lipkin model phase diagram as a function of the control parameters , ( @xmath80 ) , we have found appropriate to introduce alternative control parameters , ( @xmath81 ) , defined by , @xmath82 with this change , we can study the phase diagram in terms of the coordinates , @xmath83 where we have assumed a maximum value for @xmath84 and @xmath85 equal to 2 so as the angles @xmath86 and @xmath87 are defined between @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - coord ] ) .",
    "the geometric representation of the two - fluid consistent - q - like lipkin hamiltonian will be , therefore , a pyramid in this phase space .",
    "one vertex corresponds to the @xmath90 limit of the model ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the bottom plane , @xmath91 @xmath92 , corresponds to the @xmath29 dynamical algebra ( both fluid are combined symmetrically into a single @xmath8 ) algebra , which is equivalent at the mean - field level to the single lipkin model ( in the ibm-2 case , the equivalent horizontal plane represents the ibm-1 , i.e. , a symmetric combination of the two boson fluids ) . in this plane , the line @xmath51 ( @xmath93 ) goes from the @xmath94 to the @xmath90 limit .",
    "as soon as one considers @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) one moves in the vertical direction of the pyramid and any present symmetry will become broken .",
    "of special interest is the vertical plane @xmath76 ( @xmath97 ) because , for this combination of parameters , the mean - field energy is invariant under the transformation @xmath98 . note that the two remaining vertexes do not correspond to any symmetry of the model ( in the case of ibm-2 they correspond to the @xmath99 and @xmath100 symmetries ) .",
    "as a first step to establish the phase diagram of the model , in the following of this section we will present numerical studies of different trajectories within the phase space of the model ( @xmath101 ) in order to identify the different phases and phase transition surfaces / lines .    to get a geometrical idea about system shapes in the different regions of the phase space",
    ", we note that the region around the @xmath90 vertex corresponds to values of the variational parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 equal to zero .",
    "since @xmath102 parameters give the weight of the @xmath10 bosons in the boson condensate , @xmath103 implies a condensate of spherical @xmath9 bosons .",
    "consequently the phase around the @xmath90 vertex is called _ symmetric _ or _",
    "spherical_. the corresponding spectrum will become nearly harmonic .",
    "when the system goes well apart of the @xmath90 vertex , both variational parameters , @xmath66 and @xmath67 become different from zero .",
    "this makes that the boson condensate in both fluids has a fraction of @xmath10 bosons .",
    "thus , this phase is called _ non - symmetric _ or _",
    "deformed_. the horizontal plane corresponds to @xmath104 which implies equal deformations for both fluids what bring us back to the single lipkin model .    to study the possible phase transitions that occur in the phase diagram we have performed numerical analysis through selected straight trajectories in the phase space .",
    "for each of them the equilibrium energy , the derivatives of the energy functional , and also the equilibrium values of the variational parameters have been analyzed .",
    "all exact calculations presented in this section correspond to @xmath105 but similar studies can be done for @xmath106 and other boson numbers .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     combining all the preceding evidences one gets the phase diagram depicted in fig .  [ fig - dia ] , where one can appreciate a first order phase transition surface separating the symmetric ( spherical ) and non - symmetric ( deformed ) phases and the first order phase transition vertical surface separating two different deformed phases",
    ". we will see in next section that the intersection line between both surfaces , from @xmath92 up to @xmath107 is a second order phase transition line , while for larger values of @xmath108 it becomes first order .",
    "note that the phase diagram can be extended to negative values of @xmath109 and @xmath108 , with the first order phase transition surface separating _ spherical _ and _ deformed _ phase extended to four quadrants and the vertical first order phase transition surface and the second order phase transition line extended to negative values of @xmath108 .",
    "once the main structure of the phase diagram of the model is known numerically , it is necessary to perform an analytic study to determine unambiguously the order of the phase transitions of surfaces and lines appearing in the phase diagram and to understand why the qpt areas are precisely located there . to carry out this task",
    "we will make use of catastrophe theory ( ct ) @xcite , which is an ideal tool for such an end .    in general ,",
    "the aim of ct is to study a given potential , @xmath110 ( in our case the mean - field energy surface of the model ) or a family of potentials that are function of a set of order parameters , @xmath111 and that depend on a set of control parameters , @xmath112 , and to study the qualitative behavior of the potential , e.g. , number of minima and maxima , as a function of the control parameters . to proceed one should start looking for the stationary points ( also known as critical points ) , i.e. ,",
    "those whose gradient vanish and classify them according to their stability : i ) points where the determinant of the hessian matrix is different from zero , called isolated , non - degenerated or morse points , and ii ) points where the determinant of the hessian matrix is zero , called non - isolated , degenerated or non - morse points . in summary , points of a family of smooth potentials can be classified according to their gradient and hessian matrix @xmath113 as :    * regular points : @xmath114 . *",
    "morse points ( isolated critical points ) : @xmath115 and @xmath116 . *",
    "non - morse points ( degenerated critical points ) : @xmath115 and @xmath117 .",
    "morse theorem @xcite guarantees that around a morse point , a smooth potential is equivalent to a quadratic form , performing a smooth non - linear change of variables .",
    "therefore , the potential is stable under small perturbations around morse points . at non -",
    "morse points the potential can not be written as a quadratic form because the hessian matrix has at least one zero eigenvalue . around non - morse points ct",
    "will provide useful information on how the qualitative shape of the potential will evolve under small variations of the order parameters .    in the case of several order parameters , thom s _ splitting lemma _",
    "@xcite guarantees that a smooth potential at non - morse points can be written as a sum of a quadratic form , associated to the subspace with nonzero eigenvalues , plus a function containing the variables associated to the zero eigenvalues of the hessian matrix .",
    "the first step in the ct program is to find out the critical points of the energy surface ( @xmath118 ) . among them ,",
    "the most important is the most degenerate one , i.e. , the point where most successive derivatives vanish .",
    "this point is the fundamental root taking place at definite values of the control parameters which we will call critical values .",
    "we next proceed making use of a taylor expansion of the energy surface around the fundamental root .",
    "a taylor expansion around such a point is also valid for the critical points that _ arise _ from the fundamental root when the degeneracy is broken .",
    "depending on the degeneracy of the fundamental root the number of extremes that can be analyzed simultaneously will change .",
    "it is worth to note that the different minima related with the appearance of a critical phenomenon arise from a degenerated non - morse point .",
    "when the potential depends on several variables , as the case for the two - fluid lipkin model is , it is important to separate the variables into two sets , depending on how hessian eigenvalues behave . on one hand , one has the variables associated to the subspace with vanishing hessian eigenvalues , called _ bad _ or _ essential _ variables , while , on the other hand , there is a set of variables related to the non - vanishing hessian eigenvalues , called _ good _ or _ non - essential _ variables .",
    "therefore , as a consequence of the _ splitting lemma _",
    "@xcite , the potential could be separated into a part depending on the _ essential _ variables and into another part depending on the _ non - essential _",
    "ones by rewriting it in terms of the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix @xcite .",
    "the appearance of critical phenomena will be associated exclusively with the behavior of the _ essential _ variables , i.e. , the variables that can be identified as order parameters of the system .      according to eqs .",
    "( [ energ-1 ] ) and ( [ energ-2 ] ) the most degenerated critical point for the two - fluid lipkin model ( [ hcqf ] ) corresponds to @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( all derivatives up to fourth order vanish for an appropriated set of parameters ) and , taking into account the shape of the phase diagram , all the critical points that can eventually arise in the energy surface are born from this most degenerated critical point . since there are two shape variables it is necessary to construct , first , the hessian matrix associated to the energy surface ( [ energ-1 ] ) , @xmath121 the two eigenvalues are @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and the corresponding eigenvectors are , @xmath124 the eigenvalue associated to @xmath125 vanishes for @xmath126 while the one associated to @xmath127 only vanishes for the trivial case @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the _ essential _ variable turns out to be @xmath125 , while @xmath127 becomes the _ non - essential _ one , i.e. , the origin in this variable behaves as a morse point .",
    "next step is to carry out a taylor expansion in @xmath125 and @xmath127 around zero .",
    "because we use @xmath125 and @xmath127 , the quadratic term @xmath128 will not be present in the taylor expansion .",
    "note that we are considering the case @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath129 in order to cancel the higher order terms ( @xmath130 with @xmath131 ) we have to implement a nonlinear transformation in @xmath127 @xmath132 after imposing the cancellation of the crossing terms and determining the value of @xmath133 , we get the next expression that is valid in the neighborhood of @xmath134 , but for any value of @xmath127 ( note that in order to simplify the notation we continue referring to the _ non - essential _ variable as @xmath127 instead of @xmath135 ) , @xmath136    the number of lower order terms that are kept in the taylor expansion without loosing substantial information with respect to the original function ( problem of _ determinacy _ ) is determined studying the terms in the taylor expansion that can be canceled out with appropriated particular values of the control parameters . for eq .",
    "( [ taylor1 ] ) the values of the control parameters , @xmath126 , @xmath137 and @xmath107 cancel all terms up to @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , the dominant remaining term is @xmath139 and it is said that the function is @xmath140 .",
    "hence , the number of _ essential _ parameters will be @xmath141 .",
    "consequently , the relevant elementary catastrophe of this model is the _ butterfly _ ( a@xmath142 )",
    "it is worth mentioning that the _ butterfly _ has a _ codimension _ equal to @xmath143 , i.e. , the number of essential parameters is @xmath143 . in our case , due to the function symmetry , the number of parameters is only @xmath141 . in general , depending on the values selected for the control parameters , the potential energy may have three , two , or one local minima",
    ". please note that eq .",
    "( [ taylor1 ] ) does not correspond to the canonical form of the _ butterfly _ because it presents a fifth order term instead of the first order one .",
    "however , one always can perform a _ shift _",
    "transformation in the @xmath125 variable to recover the canonical form . in order to determine the order of the phase transitions , already studied numerically in the preceding section , we can take advantage of eq .",
    "( [ taylor1 ] ) . in general , for any situation with @xmath144 the cubic ( and fifth ) term always survives for any value of @xmath108 and , therefore , the phase transition will become first order .",
    "the reason is simple , the presence of a cubic ( and fifth ) term guaranties the possible appearance of several critical points ( i.e. , a region of coexistence ) , three critical points ( two minima and one maximum ) when the @xmath145 coefficient and the @xmath146 coefficient are positive and five critical points ( three minima and two maxima ) when the @xmath145 coefficient is positive and the @xmath146 coefficient is negative ( see below for more details ) .",
    "note that in our case , the @xmath139 coefficient is always positive .",
    "indeed , this particular situation is precisely the one necessary to develop a first order phase transition .",
    "this happens in almost the whole surface separating the _ symmetric _ ( spherical ) and _ non - symmetric _ ( deformed ) phases .    to know the character of the vertical surface , @xmath137 ( with @xmath147 )",
    ", one can note that the lowest leading terms are : @xmath145 with negative coefficient and @xmath146 with positive coefficient .",
    "this potential gives rise to two degenerated minima symmetric with respect to the origin , @xmath134 .",
    "as soon as one perturbs the system , changing @xmath109 ( to either positive or negative values ) the degeneracy is broken and one of the deformed minima is lower in energy .",
    "therefore , this situation corresponds to a first order phase transition since the order parameter will jump suddenly from one to the other minimum .",
    "it is also of interest to see how one can recover the case corresponding to the single lipkin , i.e. , @xmath92 . for this case ( horizontal plane )",
    "the energy surface reads as , @xmath148 where one can easily single out that for the line @xmath126 , values @xmath149 produce a first order phase transition since the cubic term is present . for the particular value @xmath137 the cubic term vanishes and ,",
    "therefore , the transition is no longer of first order , but of second order .",
    "finally , a most interesting case is the intersection line between the surfaces @xmath150 ( vertical plane , separating two regions of different deformation ) and @xmath151 ( spherical surface separating spherical from deformed shapes ) .",
    "for this situation , the energy functional is written as , @xmath152     but including the corresponding energy curves as a function of the _ essential _ order parameter @xmath125 . ]",
    "this situation looks like the case @xmath153 , because no odd terms appear in the expansion and only the onset of a second order phase transition is expected .",
    "however , there are fundamental differences .",
    "the key point to disentangle the stability structure of the energy surface is the sign of the fourth order coefficient .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath126 is indeed of second order if the fourth order coefficient remains positive but will change to first order otherwise .",
    "there is a critical value for @xmath108 for which the fourth order coefficient vanishes , i.e. , @xmath107 and @xmath126 . at this point ,",
    "the only term that survives in the energy functional is the sixth order term .",
    "the most important consequence is that at this point the energy surface is very flat ( as @xmath139 ) .",
    "going to values with @xmath154 , the fourth order coefficient changes to negative sign , which implies that there is no longer a second order phase transition , but a first order one since , in this case , there is a sudden change in the order parameter when crossing the qpt point . to understand this fact let us write in a more compact form the taylor expansion ( [ lasexta ] ) as , @xmath155 where @xmath156 . according to eq .",
    "( [ lasexta ] ) : @xmath157 for @xmath158 , @xmath159 for @xmath147 and @xmath160 for @xmath126 ; at @xmath126 , @xmath161 for @xmath162 , @xmath163 for @xmath154 , and @xmath164 for @xmath107 ; for @xmath165 @xmath166 is always positive .",
    "equation @xmath167 has as solutions , @xmath168    the spherical solution ( @xmath169 ) corresponds to a minimum if @xmath170 , i.e. , @xmath158 ( to a maximum if @xmath171 , i.e. , @xmath147 ) , irrespective of the @xmath172 sign , i.e. , independently of the @xmath108 value . for @xmath171 and @xmath173 ( which occurs for @xmath174 ) two deformed critical points exist ( symmetric with respect to the origin ) , which correspond to minima since , as discussed above , @xmath175 corresponds , in this case , to a maximum . note that for @xmath176 the two deformed minima merge into a flat spherical one , never coexisting several minima .",
    "therefore , the line @xmath150 and @xmath176 corresponds to a second order phase transition while @xmath174 .    for @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( which occurs for @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) five critical points",

    "the other two extremes correspond to maxima ( symmetric with respect to the origin ) .",
    "the particular region @xmath150 , @xmath176 ( @xmath126 ) for values @xmath179 , is a region of coexistence of three minima , one spherical and two deformed . at the critical point",
    "all three minima are degenerated . as a consequence ,",
    "a first order phase transition develops around this line .",
    "the first order phase transition line is defined then by @xmath182 and is bounded by the spinodal ( @xmath183 ) and the antispinodal ( @xmath184 ) lines given by , @xmath185 for the case @xmath186 only the spherical minimum exists .",
    "it is worth analyzing what happens at the special line @xmath150 and @xmath107 .",
    "for this line @xmath187 and the energy surface presents three critical points when @xmath171 ( @xmath188 ) , @xmath189 the first one , spherical , corresponds to a maximum and the second and the third , deformed and symmetric with respect to the origin , correspond to minima .",
