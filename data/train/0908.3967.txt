    "it is a well - known fact by now that non - linear electrodynamics ( ned ) with various formulations has therapeutic effects on the divergent results that arise naturally in linear maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "the theory introduced by born and infeld ( bi ) in 1930s @xcite constitutes the most prominent member among such class of viable ned theories .",
    "apart from the healing power of singularities , however , drawbacks were not completely eliminated from the theory .",
    "one such serious handicap was pointed out by born s co - workers shortly after the introduction of the original bi theory .",
    "this concerns the double - valued dependence of the displacement vector @xmath1 as a function of the electric field @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "that is , for the common value of @xmath2 the displacement @xmath3 undergoes a branching which from physical grounds was totally unacceptable . to overcome this particular problem , hoffman and infeld @xcite and rosen@xcite , both published successive papers on this issue",
    "specifically , the model lagrangian proposed by hoffman and infeld ( hi ) contained a logarithmic term with remarkable consequences .",
    "it removed , for instance , the singularity that used to arise in the cartesian components of the @xmath2 .",
    "being unaware of this contribution by hi , and after almost 70 years , we have rediscovered recently the ubiquitous logarithmic term of lagrangian while in attempt to construct a model of elementary particle in einstein - ned theory @xcite . in our model",
    "the spacetime is divided into two regions : the inner region consists of the bertotti - robinson ( br ) @xcite spacetime while the outer region is a reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) type spacetime .",
    "the radius of our particle coincides with the horizon of the rn - type black hole solution whereas inner br part represents a singularity - free uniform electric field region .",
    "the two regions and the ned are glued together at the horizon on which the appropriate boundary conditions gave not only a feasible geometrical model of a particle but remarkably resolved also the double - valued property of the displacement vector . in other words , with our technique , @xmath4 turns automatically into a single - valued function .    in this paper",
    "we wish to make further use of the hoffman - born - infeld ( hbi ) lagrangian in general relativity , more specifically , in constructing 4-dimensional ( 4d ) regular black holes and thin - shell wormholes .",
    "the wormholes in 4d requires , unfortunately , exotic matter to survive .",
    "we extend our model also to 5d - gauss - bonnet ( gb ) theory and search for the possibility of wormholes dominated by normal ( i.e. satisfying the energy conditions ) matter rather than exotic matter .",
    "our analysis reveal that for the negative gb parameter @xmath5 5d thin - shell wormholes supported by normal matter exists , and they are stable against linear radial perturbations . due to the intricate structure of the potential function , stability analysis is carried out numerically .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "v we give 5d black hole and wormholes in ehbigb theory with emphasis on stability analysis of wormholes given in sec .",
    "we finalize the paper with conclusion , which appears in sec .",
    "singularity for classical charged elementary particles leads to infinite self - electromagnetic energy .",
    "this should be removed from the maxwell theory of charged particles and in this regard born and infeld ( bi ) introduced a non - linear electrodynamics such that successfully they solved the problem in some senses @xcite .",
    "briefly , we can summarize their proposal in curved spacetime by considering a spherically symmetric pure electrically charged particle described by the line element@xmath6they aimed to have a non - singular electric field ( we use @xmath7 ) with radial component @xmath8which means that the maxwell @xmath9form is of the form @xmath10the corresponding action is @xmath11 in which @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 stands for duality ( here we only consider the static , spherically symmetric electric field such that @xmath15 .",
    "easily one finds the maxwell equation modified into @xmath16which reveals @xmath17or@xmath18since @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21it yields@xmath22where @xmath23constant of integration , which is identified as the charge @xmath24 .",
    "solution for the lagrangian , after adjusting the constants , takes the form of@xmath25i.e .",
    ", the bi lagrangian .",
    "this example gives an idea of how simple it is to find a lagrangian which yields a non - singular electric field , but the question was whether this much was enough .",
    "hoffman and infeld @xcite shortly after the bi non - linear lagrangian , pointed this problem out and tried to get rid of any possible difficulties .    in @xcite the authors remarked that although the electric field becomes finite at @xmath26 it yields a discontinuity , for instance in the cartesian component @xmath27 to quote from @xcite `` it is evident that any finite value for @xmath28 at @xmath26 will lead to a discontinuity of this type '' .",
    "accordingly , their proposal alternative to the bi lagrangian can be summarized as follows . the simplest non - singular electric field which takes zero value at @xmath26",
    "can be written as@xmath29so that @xmath30 in terms of @xmath31 is @xmath32where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . from ( 7 )",
    "we find @xmath37where the positive branch leads to the lagrangian@xmath38with @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 let us note that we wrote the lagrangian in this form to show consistency with 2 . again we remind that the constant @xmath42 has been chosen in such a way that @xmath43 which is the maxwell limit . in analogy ,",
    "the negative branch gives @xmath44where @xmath45 it should be noted that , here one does not expect the maxwell limit as @xmath46 goes to zero .",
    "in fact , since @xmath47 is defined for @xmath36 automatically @xmath46 can not be zero unless @xmath48 also goes to zero in which , the case @xmath49 becomes meaningless .",
    "having @xmath50 for @xmath35 and @xmath49 for @xmath51 imposes @xmath52 which is satisfied , as it should . also at @xmath53 one gets @xmath54 which is the maximum value that @xmath28 may take .",
    "based on the criticisms made in @xcite , as mentioned above , we see that this lagrangian removes the discontinuity in , say , @xmath27 so , shall we adopt this lagrangian for further results ?",
    "the answer was given few years later by rosen @xcite , which was not affirmative .",
    "the crux of the problem lies in the relation between @xmath28 and @xmath55 let us go back to the previous case ( 10 ) once more .",
    "it is known from non - linear electrodynamics @xcite that @xmath56which is singular at @xmath26 .",
    "of course , being singular for @xmath57 does not matter ; the problem arises once we consider @xmath57 as a function of @xmath28 . in this way at @xmath26 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 and",
    "once @xmath60 again @xmath61 but @xmath62 .",
    "this means that @xmath57 in terms of @xmath28 is double - valued(i.e . , @xmath63 and @xmath64)@xmath65 concerning this objection rosen suggested to reject this lagrangian and instead he recommended that the lagrangian should be a function of the potentials .",
    "for the detail of his work we suggest ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we wish to draw attention to a recent paper we published @xcite which gives a different solution to this problem . before we give the detail of the solution we admit that during the time of working on @xcite we were not aware about this problem , and we did not know the hoffman - infeld ( hi ) form of lagrangian . in certain sense , we have rediscovered a lagrangian of 70 years old anew , from the hard way . !",
    "returning to the problem , we see that in the case of the hi lagrangian they used two different forms for inside and outside of the typical particle in order to keep the spacetime spherically symmetric , static reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) type .",
    "this is understandable since in 1930s rn solution was one of the best known solution whereas the bertotti - robinson ( br ) @xcite solution was yet unknown .",
    "the latter ,",
    "i.e. , br , constitutes a prominent inner substitute to ( rn ) as far as einstein - maxwell solutions are concerned , and resolves the singularity at @xmath26 , which caused hi to worry about 2 . as we gave the detail of such a choice in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can choose @xmath66 for all regions ( i.e. , @xmath67 the radius of our particle , and @xmath68 for outside we adopted a rn type spacetime while for inside we had to choose a br type spacetime .",
    "accordingly one finds @xmath69and consequently@xmath70which clearly reveals that @xmath57 is not a double valued function of @xmath28 any more@xmath65 we note that in matching the two spacetimes the lanczos energy - momentum tensor @xcite was employed .",
    "let us add further that this is not the unique choice , so that the opposite choice also is possible .",
    "that is , a rn type spacetime for @xmath71 and a br type spacetime for @xmath72 in this latter choice the lagrangian is @xmath73 everywhere , which yields @xmath74and@xmath75is again not double - valued . in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied in detail the first case alone . obviously , the second case also can be developed into a model of elementary particle .",
    "once more , we start with the ehbi lagrangian @xmath76where @xmath46 is a free parameter such that@xmath77and @xmath78which are the rn and schwarzschild ( s ) limits , respectively .",
    "our action is chosen now as @xmath79where @xmath80 is the ricci scalar for the line element ( 1 ) and @xmath81 is the ned lagrangian described hitherto .",

    "one can easily show that@xmath87and @xmath88it is interesting to observe that although the adm mass of ehbi solution is still @xmath86 , the effective mass depends on charge and hbi parameter , i.e. , @xmath89here one may set the effective mass to zero ( note that the adm mass of the ehbi is not zero and survives in the metric indirectly ) i.e.,@xmath90to get a regular metric function whose kretschmann and ricci scalars are finite at any point .",
    "it should be noted that this is not the case for the regular solution mentioned in @xcite , i.e. in contrast to @xcite , our ehbi black hole is not massless .    by employing the solution ( 25 )",
    "now we proceed to investigate some thermodynamical properties of the ehbi black hole .",
