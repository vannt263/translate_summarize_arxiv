    "the dust particles become charged and interact collectively , and depending upon the system parameters can be in the gaseous or liquid state or even arrange themselves to form an orderly crystalline structure in a solid state@xcite .",
    "the complex plasma medium also supports a variety of collective modes and nonlinear coherent structures , such as dust - ion - acoustic ( dia ) waves @xcite , dust - acoustic ( da ) waves @xcite , dust lattice ( dl ) waves @xcite , dust coulomb waves @xcite , dust voids @xcite and vortices @xcite . among them , the dia solitary waves , the da solitary waves , the dl solitary waves , and the envelope of dia / da solitary waves are very important nonlinear waves which have been extensively studied both theoretically @xcite , and experimentally @xcite over the past few years .",
    "interaction of solitons is an interesting phenomenon in normal fluids and plasma which has been reported by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the observation that a discrete nonlinear system exhibits recurrent states instead of an ergodic behavior was explained by zabusky and kruskal @xcite , who realized that the nonlinear chain is described by the kdv equation in the continuum limit . thus any deviation from kdv approximation in real systems will affect the thermalization time and break the recurrence of the initial state . in a one dimensional system",
    ", the solitons may interact amongst themselves in two different ways .",
    "there can be an overtaking collision ( for co - propagating solitons ) , which can be studied by the inverse scattering transform method @xcite or a head - on collision ( counter - propagating solitons ) , where the angle between the two propagation directions of the two solitons is equal to @xmath0 . for a head  on collision between two solitary waves travelling from positive and negative directions , the important post - collision consequences to study are the phase shifts and resultant changes in their respective trajectories .",
    "many authors have investigated the head - on collision of two solitary waves in different plasma models using the extended poincar  lighthill  kuo ( plk ) method @xcite . in a dusty plasma ,",
    "xue @xcite investigated the head - on collisions of dust  acoustic solitary waves in an unmagnetized dusty plasma including the dust charge variation , and the analytical phase shifts following the head  on collision were derived .",
    "they showed the variation of phase shift with different plasma parameters .",
    "@xcite studied the head - on collision of dust acoustic solitary waves in a four component unmagnetized dusty plasma with boltzmann distributed electrons , non - thermal ions , and negatively charged dust grains as well as positively charged dust grains .",
    "very recently , a couple of experimental observations @xcite have been reported separately on the head - on collision of two counter - propagating solitary waves .",
    "they found that both the solitary waves pass through each other and suffer a small time delay in their propagation after the collision .",
    "in one of the observations , harvey _ et al . _ @xcite found the sum of the amplitude of individual solitons is less than that of resultant solitary amplitude whereas the sharma et al .",
    "@xcite reported that the resultant amplitude is exactly equal to the sum of individual amplitudes .",
    "but in both the cases , it is observed that the solitons with higher amplitude experience longer delays .    to the best of our knowledge , there has been no detailed investigation on the interaction of solitary waves in a strongly coupled dusty plasma . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the head - on collision of dust acoustic solitary waves and deduce the phase shifts by an extended version of the plk method considering the effects of strong coupling between the dust particles in an appropriate fluid model .",
    "the fluid model we adopt is based on the generalized hydrodynamic equations which have been used in the past to study the linear @xcite and non - linear @xcite propagation of dust acoustic waves in a strongly coupled dusty plasma .",
    "these studies have shown that strong coupling effects introduce additional dispersive effects in the linear propagation characteristics of daws through modifications in the compressibility and visco - elastic properties of the system .",
    "an interesting consequence is the  turn - over \" effect where beyond a certain value of the strong coupling parameter the group velocity of the daw can change sign and travel backward .",
    "a nonlinear manifestation of this effect should be of interest to investigate and is a major motivation for our present study . to explore this effect we have looked at the variation of the phase shift that arises due to the head - on collision between two dust acoustic solitary waves , over a wide range of plasma and dusty plasma parameters .",
    "it is found that there is a significant change of phase shift in the strongly coupled regime compared to the weakly coupled regime and beyond a critical value of the compressibility there is a change in the sign of the phase shift .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the model equations to deduce the expression for phase shifts of two solitons after making a head - on collision by taking into account strong coupling between the particles . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss our analytical results of phase shifts in a wide range of plasma and dusty plasma parameters .",
    "a brief concluding remark is made in sec .",
    "in the standard fluid model treatment @xcite of a dusty plasma for studying low frequency phenomena ( @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the dust , ion and electron plasma frequencies respectively ) in the regime where the dust dynamics is important , it is appropriate to treat the electrons and the ions as light fluids that can be described by boltzmann distributions and to use the full set of hydrodynamic equations ( momentum , continuity and poisson equations ) to describe the dynamics of the dust component . hence in this paper ,",
    "the electrons and the ions are treated as inertialess and are assumed to be in local thermodynamical equilibrium with their number density obeying the boltzmannian distribution .",
    "thus the densities of electrons and ions at temperature @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be written in a normalized form as @xcite @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the ratio of ion temperature and electron temperature , @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been normalized by their equilibrium values @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively and @xmath13 has been normalized as @xmath14 . here @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the electronic charge and the boltzmann constant , respectively . to describe the dynamics of dust particles , we use the well known generalized hydrodynamic model @xcite that takes into account strong coupling effects in a phenomenological manner by introducing visco - elastic effects and a modified compressibility",
    ". in the regime where existence of solitonic waves and their propagation characteristics are important the predominant change due to strong coupling effects are in the dispersion properties .",
    "this is manifested through a change in the compressibility as seen in the linear effect of a turnover in the dispersion relation .",
    "accordingly , for our solitonic study we retain the compressibility effect and neglect dissipative effects arising from viscosity and dust neutral collisions .",
    "these dissipative effects when important would cause a damping of the solitary pulse .",
    "the neglect of dissipative effects is a valid approximation in the so called `` kinetic regime '' when @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mode freqency and @xmath19 is the relaxation ( memory ) time .",
    "thus our model fluid equations for the dust component consisting of the continuity and the momentum coupled to the poisson equation can be written as , @xmath20 this model has already been implemented successfully to explain the turn over of dispersion relation of daws @xcite and the existence of shear waves @xcite in dusty plasma .",
    "the contribution due to the compressibility ( @xmath21 ) in the momentum equation ( eq .  ( [ eqn : mom ] ) ) is expressed in terms of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the dust temperature .",
    "following @xcite we can define the compressibility as , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the free energy of the system and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath27 in the weakly coupled gaseous phase ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath21 is positive but can become negative as @xmath29 increases and one gets into the liquid state .",
    "the change in sign of @xmath21 is responsible for the turnover effect in the linear dispersion relation of the dust acoustic wave .    in the above equations ( [ eqn : con][eqn : pos ] ) , @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 represent the normalized number density and the velocity of the dust fluid , respectively .",

    "now we consider the excitation of two solitary waves a and b that are far apart from each other and let them propagate towards each other such that after sometime they interact and make a head - on collision .",
    "we consider the regime where the perturbations are small enough for the weakly nonlinear approximation to hold good .",
    "we therefore expect the collision to be quasielastic leading to shifts of the post collision trajectories ( phase shift ) . here",
    "we are interested to study the dynamics of these solitary waves in presence of strong coupling effect . in order to analyse the effect of collision",
