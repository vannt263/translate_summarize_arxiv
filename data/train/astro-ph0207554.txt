    "features of a population of massive stars can be synthesized to provide information on the star formation rates , the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) , and ages ( e.g. robert , leitherer & heckman 1993 ; leitherer , robert & heckman 1995 ; de mello , leitherer & heckman 2000 ) . in the optical region ,",
    "the properties of integrated stellar populations are usually derived indirectly from their total radiative energy outputs using nebular diagnostic line ratios ( e.g. garca - vargas , bressan & daz 1995 ; stasi ' nska & leitherer 1996 ; stasi ' nska , schaerer & leitherer 2001 ) .",
    "this method uses the theoretical ionizing fluxes from a population of massive stars as a function of age as input into a photoionization code .",
    "the ability of evolutionary synthesis models to predict correctly the properties of a young stellar population from nebular emission line ratios therefore depends heavily on the accuracy of the evolutionary and atmospheric models developed for single massive stars .",
    "early attempts to model stellar populations using evolutionary synthesis coupled with photoionization codes relied mainly on kurucz ( 1992 ) plane - parallel lte model atmospheres ( e.g. garca - vargas et al .",
    "gabler et al . ( 1989 ) , however , showed that the presence of a stellar wind has a significant effect on the emergent ionizing flux in the neutral and ionized helium continua of o stars .",
    "non - lte effects depopulate the ground state of he , leading to a decrease in the bound - free opacity above 54ev , and hence a larger flux in the he  continuum by up to 36 orders of magnitude .",
    "the emergent spectrum is flattened in the region of the he  continuum and has a higher flux due to the presence of the stellar wind .",
    "stasi ' nska & leitherer ( 1996 ) were the first to use expanding non - lte atmospheres for stars with strong winds to construct photoionization models for evolving starbursts .",
    "they used the grid of pure helium , unblanketed non - lte w - r atmospheres from schmutz , leitherer & gruenwald ( 1992 ) to represent evolved stars with strong winds , and kurucz ( 1992 ) models for hot stars close to the main sequence .",
    "line - blanketed , expanding non - lte models covering the main sequence evolution of o stars were first introduced by stasi ' nska & schaerer ( 1997 ) who studied the effect of using the costar models of schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) on the ionization of single star h  regions .",
    "they found that higher ionic ratios were obtained in comparison to kurucz models with the same stellar temperatures .",

    "since the observed he@xmath4/h@xmath5 ratio shows a decrease with increasing abundance ( e.g. bresolin et al . 1999 ) , this has led to the suggestion that effective temperature decreases with increasing @xmath108 .",
    "we see , however , that the wm - basic model predictions are not flat but show a decrease between 1 and 2z@xmath0 .",
    "this is because our new line - blanketed models have a softer ionizing flux in the hecontinuum at high @xmath108 ( fig .",

    "some of these objects have w - r features in their spectra but the nebular line ratios are not affected i.e. they find no observational evidence that h  regions ionized by clusters containing w - r stars show any signs of harder ionizing fluxes .    in fig .",

    "it can be seen that the sv98 models are too hard , particularly for the @xmath117 case , whereas the new models are coincident with the data points .",
    "we conclude that , for the parameter range explored , the ionizing fluxes of the new models are in much better agreement with the observed emission line ratios of hregions than previous model grids .",
    "the success of the technique of evolutionary synthesis for deriving the properties of young stellar populations depends on the accuracy of the model atmospheres and evolutionary tracks for massive stars . in this paper , we have sought to provide a grid of realistic ionizing fluxes for o and w - r stars using the latest line - blanketed , non - lte atmosphere codes .",
    "we have carefully chosen the input stellar parameters to reflect current values available in the literature . while these appear to be well established for the o spectral class ,",
    "there have been major revisions for the w - r stars .",
    "we have incorporated these changes by using lower clumping - corrected mass loss rates and lower temperatures compared to the previous w - r grid of slg92 .",
    "we have also introduced metallicity - dependent mass loss rates because recent observational and theoretical work indicate that the strength of w - r winds should scale with heavy metal abundance ( crowther et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
    "the lower , metallicity - dependent , w - r mass loss rates have implications for the amount of mass and energy returned to the interstellar medium from young starbursts .",
    "we will address this topic in a future paper .",
    "briefly , in comparison to leitherer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , we find that w - r stars no longer dominate the energy input , particularly at low metallicity . our revised o star mass loss rates , however , are larger than those given by the analytical formula of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and this leads to an overall increase in the rates of mass and energy input .",
    "as discussed in section  [ comp ] and slg92 , the emergent flux below 228  depends on the wind density and hence the scaling law used to scale the wind parameters with metallicity .",
    "the precise scaling even for o stars has not been determined empirically and relies on the predictions of radiatively - driven wind theory .",
    "it is of course unknown for w - r stars and we simply chose to use the o star scaling law .",
    "the predicted number of he@xmath51 ionizing photons at metallicities below solar should therefore be considered as rather uncertain .",
    "we now discuss the presence of nebular he  @xmath1 emission .",
    "guseva et al . ( 2000 ) compile a list of 30 h  galaxies with nebular he  detections .",
    "schaerer ( 1996 ) used costar and the slg92 models to synthesize the strength of nebular he@xmath1 emission in the early stages of a starburst .",
    "schaerer predicts that strong nebular he  emission will be present during the w - r phase with @xmath118(he)/@xmath118(h@xmath5)@xmath1190.025 for @xmath71z@xmath120 .",
    "guseva et al . (",
    "2000 ) find that the predicted he  emission line strengths ( as given by sv98 ) agree reasonably well with the observations except that the sv98 models predict the highest @xmath118(he)/@xmath118(h@xmath5 ) ratios to occur at 1 and 2@xmath62 , while no nebular he  is detected in objects with @xmath121z@xmath0 .",
    "they also find that w - r stars can not be the sole source of nebular he  emission since only 60 per cent of their sample have w - r stars present , and they suggest additional mechanisms such as radiative shocks are needed to explain all the observations .",
    "assuming case b recombination and an ionization - bounded nebula , the strength of he  @xmath1 relative to h@xmath5 is given by @xmath118(he)/@xmath118(h@xmath5)@xmath122 ( sv98 ) .",
    "if we further assume that the minimum detectable @xmath118(he)/@xmath118(h@xmath5)@xmath119 , then @xmath123 for he  @xmath1 to be observable . from fig .",
    "[ qrs_inst ] , the highest value of @xmath124 , corresponding to @xmath118(he)/@xmath118(h@xmath5)@xmath125 , occurs at the beginning of the w - r phase at 0.2z@xmath0 .",
    "thus any nebular he  will be marginally observable . with the current grid of line - blanketed w - r models , it seems unlikely that the observed nebular he  associated with w - r galaxies is in general due to w - r star photoionization .",
    "we must emphasize that the w - r grid is based on the observational parameters of `` normal or average '' w - r stars and thus excludes the rare , hot early wn and wo stars with weak winds and significant fluxes above 54ev .",
    "since we do not understand the reasons for their extreme parameters , it is impossible to predict their impact on the ionizing output of young starbursts .",
    "given their rarity in the galaxy and lmc , we expect their influence to be negligible .",
    "but , if for example , they are formed via the binary channel in significant numbers at low @xmath108 , they may become an important source of he@xmath51 ionizing photons .",
    "we have also neglected shocks in the stellar winds ; they will increase the ionizing flux in the euv .",
    "it is not known how the strength of these shocks ( caused by instabilities in the line - driving force ) will scale with metallicity .",
    "the problem of assigning w - r atmospheres to evolutionary models is a long - standing one and has been extensively discussed by slg92 and in section  [ w - rcomp ] . to connect our new w - r models to the evolutionary tracks , we matched @xmath33 to @xmath126 rather than matching @xmath33 directly to @xmath66 , as in leitherer et al .",

    "the differences we find for starbursts in the w - r phase compared to the results of sv98 and leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) is therefore potentially a combination of the effects of line blanketing and using lower temperature w - r models .",
    "the overall effect of the method we have used to connect the new w - r grid with the evolutionary tracks can be gauged from figs .",
    "[ qs_inst ] and [ qrs_inst ] .",
    "the relative heights of the wn and wc bumps at @xmath45 3.5 and 5myr are very similar for all three comparisons .",
    "this suggests that the main differences we find in the w - r phase are primarily due to the inclusion of line - blanketing and that the lower temperatures are a secondary effect .",
    "the formalism that we used to interface the w - r grid to the evolutionary tracks should , however , be considered as rather uncertain . for this reason ,",
    "it is treated as a free parameter in the up - dated starburst99 code .    finally , we mention that the predictions we have made for the w - r phase as a function of metallicity depend on the evolutionary tracks of meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for single stars with enhanced mass loss rates .",
    "leitherer ( 1999 ) has compared various w - r synthesis models and discusses the differences in single and binary models .",
    "he finds that the w - r / o and wc / wn ratios are highest when the enhanced mass loss tracks are used , and that the w - r phase extends to between 6 and 10myr when binary formation is included ( see also sv98 ) .",
    "recent evolutionary models including rotation ( maeder & meynet 2000 ) have removed the necessity of artificially increasing the mass loss rate to obtain better agreement with observations of w - r stars .",
    "the lifetime of the w - r phase is increased , the wc / wn ratio is reduced , and more w - r stars are produced at low @xmath108 ( maeder & meynet 2001 ) . the next stage in improving evolutionary synthesis models should be the inclusion of evolutionary models with rotation .",
    "we have presented a large grid of non - lte , line - blanketed models for o and w - r stars covering metallicities of 0.05 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 1 and 2z@xmath0 .",

    ", we used the model atmosphere code cmfgen of hillier & miller ( 1998 ) and computed 60 wn and 60 wc models .",

    ", we used the relationships derived by nugis & lamers ( 2000 ) which are corrected for inhomogeneities in the w - r winds .",
    "for the first time , we have introduced a w - r wind / metallicity dependence and adopted the same power law exponents used for the o star models .",
    "we argue in sect .",
    "[ w - rgrid ] that recent theoretical and observational work indicate that the strengths of w - r winds must depend on metallicity .",
    "we stress that the new w - r grid excludes the few known examples of individual hot w - r stars with weak winds that have significant ionizing fluxes above 54ev . since they are so rare ( in the galaxy and lmc , at least ) , we expect them to make a negligible contribution to the ionizing flux of a young starburst .",
    "we find significant differences in the emergent fluxes from the wm - basic models compared to the costar models of schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) . for supergiants ,",
    "the wind density determines the transparency below 228 .",
    "generally , we find a lower flux in the he   continuum with important implications for nebular line diagnostic ratios .",
    "we believe that the costar models over - predict the number of he@xmath63 ionizing photons through the neglect of photon absorption in line transitions and their re - emission at longer wavelengths ( crowther et al .",

    "we have used a new method of matching the models to the evolutionary tracks by taking a weighted mean of the uncorrected hydrostatic temperature @xmath81 and the corrected hydrostatic temperature @xmath68 .",
    "this is necessary because of our lower , more realistic temperatures , particularly for the wc stars .",
    "we next compared the output ionizing fluxes of the new grid integrated into starburst99 with the evolutionary synthesis models of leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ) for an instantaneous burst and continuous star formation .",

    ", @xmath97 is softer by a factor of @xmath99 compared to the slg92 models . in contrast to schaerer ( 1996 ) , we predict that nebular he  will be at , or just below , the detection limit in low metallicity starbursts during the w - r phase .",
    "we also find lower he@xmath63 ionizing fluxes for @xmath128 z@xmath0 and ages of @xmath3myr compared to sv98 because of the smaller contributions of the line - blanketed models .",
    "the ionizing fluxes of the continuous star formation models emphasize the differences found for the single star models .",
    "we have tested the correctness of the new model grid by computing nebular line diagnostic ratios using cloudy and single star and evolutionary synthesis models as inputs . for the former , we calculated the nebular he  @xmath129/h@xmath5 ratio as a function of @xmath108 since this is a sensitive diagnostic of @xmath95 for the temperature range where he is partially ionized .",
    "observations indicate that this ratio decreases with increasing metal abundance , leading to the suggestion that the effective temperature decreases with increasing @xmath108 , and thus that the upper mass limit may be @xmath108-dependent ( e.g. bresolin et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the wm - basic models for dwarf o stars show a decrease in he  @xmath129/h@xmath5 above @xmath62 in contrast to kurucz lte models which are essentially independent of @xmath108 .",
    "this decrease is in the same sense as the observations and suggests that the observed decline in he  @xmath129/h@xmath5 with increasing @xmath108 is simply due to the effect of line blanketing above @xmath62 , and is not caused by a lowering of the upper mass limit .",
    "the ionizing fluxes of the instantaneous burst models have been tested by comparing them to the predictions of sv98 and the observations of bresolin et al .",

    "<S> we present a new grid of ionizing fluxes for o and wolf - rayet stars for use with evolutionary synthesis codes and single star hregion analyses . </S>",
    "<S> a total of 230 expanding , non - lte , line - blanketed model atmospheres have been calculated for five metallicities ( 0.05 , 0.2 , 0.4 , 1 and 2z@xmath0 ) using the wm - basic code of pauldrach et al . ( </S>",
    "<S> 2001 ) for o stars and the cmfgen code of hillier & miller ( 1998 ) for w - r stars . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar wind parameters are scaled with metallicity for both o and w - r stars . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the ionizing fluxes of the new models with the costar models of schaerer & de koter ( 1997 ) and the pure helium w - r models of schmutz , leitherer & gruenwald ( 1992 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find significant differences , particularly above 54ev , where the emergent flux is determined by the wind density as a function of metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the new models have lower ionizing fluxes in the he  continuum with important implications for nebular line ratios .    </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate the new models into the evolutionary synthesis code starburst99 ( leitherer et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1999 ) and compare the ionizing outputs for an instantaneous burst and continuous star formation with the work of schaerer & vacca ( 1998 ; sv98 ) and leitherer et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the changes in the output ionizing fluxes as a function of age are dramatic . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in contrast to previous studies , nebular he  @xmath1 will be at , or just below , the detection limit in low metallicity starbursts during the w - r phase . </S>",
    "<S> the new models have lower fluxes in the he  continuum for @xmath2z@xmath0 and ages @xmath3myr because of the increased line blanketing .    </S>",
    "<S> we test the accuracy of the new model atmosphere grid by constructing photoionization models for simple h  regions , and assessing the impact of the new ionizing fluxes on important nebular diagnostic line ratios . for the case of an h  region where the ionizing flux is given by the wm - basic dwarf o star grid , </S>",
    "<S> we show that he@xmath4/h@xmath5 decreases between 1 and 2z@xmath0 in a similar manner to observations ( e.g. bresolin et al . 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this decline is caused by the increased effect of line blanketing above solar metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that a lowering of the upper mass limit at high abundances is not required to explain the diminishing strength of he  @xmath4/h@xmath5 , as has been suggested in the past ( e.g. shields & tinsley 1976 ; bresolin et al . </S>",
    "<S> 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for an h  region where the ionizing flux is provided by an instantaneous burst of total mass @xmath6m@xmath0 , we plot the softness parameter @xmath7 against the abundance indicator @xmath8 for ages of 15myr . </S>",
    "<S> the new models are coincident with the observational data of bresolin et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1999 ) , particularly during the w - r phase , unlike the previous models of sv98 which generally over - predict the hardness of the ionizing radiation .    </S>",
