    "j. krolik and j. hawley have generously shared the data for the last three time slices of kdh and kdj , at t = 9840 m , t= 9920 m and t=10000 m. the simulations are performed in the kerr metric ( that of a rotating , uncharged black hole ) , @xmath6 .",
    "calculations are carried out in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath7",
    ". the reader should refer to * hk * and references therein for details of the simulations . we only give a brief overview of the most relevant details .",
    "the initial state is a torus of gas in equilibrium that is threaded by concentric loops of weak magnetic flux that foliate the surfaces of constant pressure .",
    "the magnetic loops are twisted azimuthally by the differentially rotating gas .",
    "this creates significant magnetic stress that transfers angular momentum outward in the gas , initiating a strong inflow that is permeated by magneto - rotational instabilities ( mri ) .",
    "the end result is that after t = a few hundred m , accreted poloidal magnetic flux gets trapped in the accretion vortex or funnel ( with an opening angle of @xmath8 at the horizon tapering to @xmath9 at @xmath10 ) .",
    "this region is the black hole magnetosphere and it supports poynting flux .",
    "the surrounding accretion flow is very turbulent .",
    "the strong transients die off by t = 2000 m , so the late time data dumps are the most physically relevant @xcite .",
    "numerically , the problem is formulated on a grid that is 192 x 192 x 64 , spanning @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the inner calculational boundary , @xmath14 ,",
    "is located close to , but just outside of the event horizon , @xmath15 , where the coordinates are singular .",
    "the @xmath16 boundary condition is periodic and the @xmath17 boundary conditions are reflective .",
    "zero - gradient boundary conditions are employed on the radial boundaries , where the contents of the active zones are copied into the neighboring ghost zones .",
    "mhd waves propagate slower than the speed of light , therefore the gravitational redshift creates a magneto - sonic critical surface outside of @xmath15 from which no mhd wave can traverse in the outward direction @xcite .",
    "the philosophy was to choose @xmath14 to lie inside the magneto - sonic critical surface , thereby isolating it from the calculational grid .",
    "there are also steep gradients in the metric derived quantities as @xmath15 is approached .",
    "this is handled by increasing the resolution of the grid near @xmath14 with a cosh distribution of radial nodes .",
    "the validity of the numerics of this method was verified , near @xmath14 , in @xcite by comparing simulations to simple analytic solutions .",
    "even so , the simulations are closely monitored to look for unnatural boundary reflections",
    ". we also note the 3-d simulations in kerr - schild coordinates ( which are nonsingular on the horizon ) in @xcite . to test the code",
    ", they ran simulations of magnetized tori that were initiated from identical input parameters to those used by hawley et al . in the words of c. fragile ( private communication ) , the results were `` remarkably similar . ''",
    "even though this was only verified for a / m=0.9 , it is compelling .",
    "consequently , for the purposes of this study it was concluded that the numerics were reliable inside the ergosphere .",
    "the conservation of global , redshifted , energy flux , defined in terms of the stress - energy tensor , is simply , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the four - momentum @xmath19 has two components : one from the fluid , @xmath20 , and one from the electromagnetic field , @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is the determinant of the metric .",
    "the integral form of the conservation law arises from the trivial integration of the partial differential expression @xcite .",
    "it follows that the poloidal components of the redshifted poynting flux are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we can use these simple expressions to understand the ehm poynting jet in kdj .",
    "figure 1 is a plot of @xmath25 in kdj viewed at three different levels of magnification , at t= 9840 m ( top row ) , t= 9920 m ( middle row ) and the bottom frames are at t = 10000 m. each frame is the average over azimuth of each time step .",
    "this greatly reduces the fluctuations as the accretion vortex is a cauldron of strong mhd waves .",
    "the individual @xmath26 slices show the same dominant behavior , however it is embedded in large mhd fluctuations .",
    "the left hand column shows strong beams of @xmath25 coming from near the black hole . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the source of these beams was @xmath27 that was created by the ergospheric disk .",
    "the base of the edj emerging from the dense equatorial plasma is well resolved in both @xmath28 and @xmath17 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 grid zones , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we turn our attention to the propagation of individual flares from the ergospheric disk out to the outer calculational boundary at @xmath31 . even though the time sampling is very coarse in the data dumps ( @xmath32 ) , we can understand the propagation of the edj because of the wide angle views available in the right hand column of figure 1 .",
    "we track the edj evolution by identifying the strong knots or flares in figure 1 based on the following reasoning .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath25 flares will propagate at the speed of an mhd discontinuity as modified by the plasma bulk flow velocity .",
    "the plasma near the edge of the vortex has accelerated to @xmath33 by r= 30 m. so the flares of @xmath25 should propagate radially at @xmath34 for @xmath35 . without having the benefit of the detailed time evolution ,",
    "this upper bound is the best estimate that we can make for @xmath36 .",
    "first , consider the strong knot , `` c , '' at t=10000 m in the right hand frame . label the outer radial extent of knot c at t = 10000 m by @xmath37 and inner radial edge by @xmath38 . translating this mhd discontinuity back in time to t",
    "= 9920 m is equivalent to a radial displacement @xmath39 .",
    "thus at t= 9920 m , knot `` c '' should extend from the ergospheric disk to @xmath40 .",
    "this is verified by the red patches in the middle frame at t=9920 m.    next consider the strong knot , `` a , '' at t= 9840 m in the right hand frame .",
    "label the outer radial extent of knot a at t = 9840 m by , @xmath41 and inner radial edge by @xmath42 .",
    "time translating this feature to t = 9920 m implies that @xmath43 , so it must be visible near the edge of the right hand frame at t = 9920 m. furthermore , unless the flare is propagating inordinately slowly , @xmath44 , @xmath45 will be beyond the outer boundary of the plot .",
    "there is only one plausible feature at t = 9920 m. finally , there is a strong flare `` b '' that is emerging from the ergospheric disk at t = 9840 m in the left and middle frames .",
    "thus , at t = 9920 m , some portion of the flare must be within 80 m of the black hole , hence the identification of `` b '' in the right hand frame .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates a type ( iii ) source in the notation of the introduction . at @xmath46 ,",
    "the edj enters the ehm from the periphery ( left hand frames ) .",
    "the edj gets quickly linked into the ehm because the ergopsheric disk magnetosphere in kdj is comprised of small patches of twisted vertical flux that become intertwined with the large - scale flux in the ehm on scales of @xmath47 1 m - 2 m @xcite . after this rapid injection",
    ", the @xmath25 in the edj keeps spreading towards the pole as it propagates outward . at the time steps that were made available to this author , the edj is the predominant source of @xmath25 in the ehm .",
    "by @xmath48 , the edj is flooding the ehm , even close to the polar axis ( it should be noted that the total energy flux is larger than @xmath25 , @xmath49 is in mechanical form in the ehm at @xmath48 ) .",
    "the relevance to this discussion is that the ehm is inundated with @xmath25 that was not created on field lines that thread the horizon , but on flux entrapped within the equatorial accreting plasma .",
    "the slow diffusion of @xmath25 poleward at @xmath50 is most likely regulated by numerical diffusion .",
    "this might seem like a problem from a numerical point of view , but physically this is not nearly as much of a concern from a qualitative standpoint .",
    "perfect mhd is just a simple tractable method of dealing with the plasma physics .",
    "a realistic , high temperature , jet plasma is likely to have anomalous resistivity from a variety of sources , @xcite , and the diffusion of field energy should naturally occur .",
    "the simulation can not accurately describe the diffusion rate .",
    "however , qualitatively speaking it indicates that if the jet propagates extremely far from the hole ( @xmath51 ) , regardless of the exact details of the diffusion microphysics , the edj energy flux is likely to get smeared out towards the polar region .",
    "there is a relatively weak edj in kdh that is noticeable at t = 9840 m , but it is otherwise negligible .",
    "this circumstance allows for the detection of weaker sources of @xmath25 that would otherwise be swamped by a strong edj .",
    "figure 2 is a plot of @xmath25 for these three time slices in chronological order , going from left to right .",
    "each frame is the average over azimuth of the time step .",
    "the contours of the radial momentum flux due to mass motion , @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the proper density and @xmath54 is the four velocity ) , is overlayed in white in order to define the location of the `` funnel wall jet , '' as was done in * hk*. the funnel wall jet is a shear layer between the accretion disk corona and the poynting jet .",
    "it is a collimated sub - relativistic flow that transports most of the mass outflow in the jetted system . in * hk * , it was shown to be driven by the total pressure ( gas plus magnetic ) gradient in the corona that is oblique to the funnel wall boundary .",
    "the gas in this region is constrained from being pushed into the funnel by the centrifugal barrier .",
    "the component of pressure gradient that is parallel to the centrifugal barrier forces the flow to be squeezed outward as a shear layer .     and the faraday tensor as @xmath55 .",
    "the left frame is averaged over @xmath16 and the right frame is at @xmath56 .",
    "the color bar is the strength of the total pressure in code units .",
    "high pressure regions of the corona are saturated and appear white . the force associated with the pressure gradient",
    "is indicated by the white arrows .",
    "the overlayed white contours represent , @xmath57 , the radial momentum flux as in figure 2 and the black contours represent @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and the faraday tensor as @xmath55 .",
    "the left frame is averaged over @xmath16 and the right frame is at @xmath56 .",
    "the color bar is the strength of the total pressure in code units .",
    "high pressure regions of the corona are saturated and appear white . the force associated with the pressure gradient",
    "is indicated by the white arrows .",
    "the overlayed white contours represent , @xmath57 , the radial momentum flux as in figure 2 and the black contours represent @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in figure 2 , there is an almost one to one correspondence , between locations where @xmath57 of the funnel wall jet increases and sites where @xmath25 increases at the funnel wall boundary in the ehm .",
    "it is the coronal pressure and not the outgoing poynting jet ( opj , hereafter ) that drives the funnel wall jet .",
    "figure 3 shows a strong flare in the total pressure ( gas plus magnetic ) at t = 10000 m. the pressure gradient seems to provide the accelerating force that drives @xmath57 .",
    "the flare appears to be a high pressure loop emerging from the corona , as evidenced by the right hand frame of figure 3 .",
    "the loop location and topology are inconsistent with the high pressure feature being injected into the corona from the funnel interior .",
    "the magnetic pressure in the corona actually exceeds the magnetic pressure in the ehm at these intermediate radii , @xmath58 , precisely the region where the flares tend to occur .",
    "table 4 of * hk * indicates that @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the total energy transported to @xmath61 by the funnel wall jet .",
    "table 4 also indicates that @xmath62 = ( 1.46/2.79 ) @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , by conservation of energy , a putative b - z effect can provide at most @xmath64 of @xmath60 , and is too feeble to drive the funnel wall jet .",
    "most of @xmath65 is directed into the equatorial accretion flow and never reaches the plasma in the opj . to see this , we summarize figure 5 of * hk*. there are broad relative maxima in @xmath66 at @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , but @xmath66 decreases rapidly with @xmath69 and @xmath70 when @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the two strongest maxima in @xmath66 are in the equatorial accretion flow at @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and this energy never reaches the opj .",
    "therefore , it is unclear how the region @xmath75 is related to the b - z mechanism . in order to understand the global energy budget ,",
    "we want to know how much @xmath65 reaches the opj .",
    "based on the available data , we can generate an upper bound .",
    "first , we define the opj as in @xcite by the magnetic dominance condition , defined in terms of the faraday field strength tensor as @xmath76 ( @xmath77 is the enthalpy per unit mass ) and @xmath78 .",
    "virtually all the @xmath25 that reaches @xmath79 in the available kdh time slices flows in the opj as defined above .",
    "inspecting our three time slices , the opj initiates at @xmath80 , with an angular extreme near the base given by @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , in agreement with the time averaged data in figure 11 of @xcite .",
    "the opj is collimated , i.e. , @xmath83 for @xmath84 ( @xmath85 for @xmath86 ) . in each of the time slices",
    ", we can compare @xmath87 near @xmath14 above the equatorial accretion flow to @xmath88 in the opj to assess how much @xmath65 reaches the opj .",
    "the simulations have significant fluctuations .",
    "averaging over r smooths out the spatial fluctuations and is a more reliable diagnostic than computing fluxes at a single radius .",
    "unfortunately , there is not enough data to perform a meaningful time average . in each time slice",
    "we find @xmath89 ; @xmath90 .",
    "the 6 inequalities tend to indicate that @xmath65 at @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is larger ( the average excess is @xmath93 ) than the total @xmath25 flowing through the opj at @xmath94 , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) and some of the @xmath65 at @xmath97 is absorbed by the accretion disk and corona at @xmath98 , @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this excess is apparently large enough to persist in spite of significant temporal variations .",
    "conversely , the probability of the hypothesis that random temporal fluctuations have conspired to mask what is actually a conserved energy flow from @xmath14 , @xmath97 ( @xmath92 ) to the opj at @xmath101 is rejected at the ( 0.5 per hemisphere ) @xmath102 significance level . integrating the area under the plot of @xmath66 in figure 5 of * hk * ,",
    "one finds that only 39% of the total @xmath65 originates in the angular range @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the data tends to show that @xmath105 is a loose upper limit to the maximum amount of @xmath65 that can reach the opj . applying this to the results in table 4 of * hk *",
    "implies that @xmath106/1.46 = 0.26 $ ] of the @xmath25 in the opj at @xmath107 is created at @xmath108 during the course of the simulation .",
    "furthermore , integrating over the funnel cross section at both @xmath14 and across the flares , @xmath109_{\\mathrm{flare } } > 1.5(1/0.597m)\\int^{2m}_{r_{in } } \\ , dr\\int^{\\theta = 70^{\\circ}}_{\\theta = 8.1^{\\circ } } s^{r}\\ , d\\theta d\\phi$ ] in the last two time steps ( there is a weak edj at t = 9820 m that skews our results , so it is omitted from this analysis ) .",
    "if one includes the mechanical energy flux as well , there is consistently more than twice the total energy flux in the strong flares then there is total energy flux through @xmath14 , @xmath97 .",
    "this suggests that coronal injection sites are sufficiently strong to make up this apparent @xmath110 deficit in @xmath25 .",
    "one might be concerned that there are only @xmath111 -10 angular zones between the coronal piston and the funnel and this leads to significant numerical diffusion . from a numerics point of view",
    "this is much more of a concern than from a physical point of view .",
    "the mhd code is just a simple approximation to any real turbulent plasma state .",
    "the turbulent corona is likely to have an anomalous resistivity and diffusion should occur @xcite .",
    "the rate of diffusion can not be determined by this simulation .",
    "however , the qualitative idea that a strong flare in coronal energy can in principle reach the funnel interior is strongly indicated .",
    "the philosophy of this paper is not that the simulations of idealized magnetized tori gives us a direct picture that can be applied to agn central engines .",
    "they are treated only as virtual laboratories to see what effects might self - consistently occur near a magnetized black hole . these simulations have led us to a new realization , the boundaries of the ehm should be dynamic and are not likely to be passive boundary surfaces for the magnetic field .",
    "it was shown that electrodynamic energy flux can arise in the ehm as a result of sources radiating energy from the lateral boundaries . even if the ehm can be construed as `` force - free , '' the dynamics of the lateral boundaries are determined by strong inertial forces that should make them strong mhd pistons . this circumstance was not anticipated in theoretical treatments of electrodynamic jets in the ehm @xcite .",
    "the fact that electromagnetic energy can come into the ehm from the side goes right to the heart of the assumptions in the b - z solution .",
    "the b - z solution is the perfect mhd solution in which energy conservation reduces to poynting flux conservation from the horizon to a relativistic wind at asymptotic infinity @xcite . from this condition ,",
    "the parameters of the field are uniquely determined for a given poloidal field distribution , in particular the field line angular velocity , @xmath112 , and the total electromagnetic energy output from the black hole , @xmath113 .",
    "if there are strong sources of poynting flux along the lateral walls of the ehm , the spacetime near the event horizon can not adjust the system to enforce the b - z field parameters within the ehm .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the plasma near the event horizon in the ehm can not effectively react back on the outgoing wind or jet and modify its electromagnetic properties because of the gravitational redshifting of the mhd characteristics @xcite .",
    "the plasma near the horizon in the ehm will passively accept any field parameters imposed by the edj and the accretion disk corona @xcite .",
    "as such , in a general astrophysical context , the basic parameters such as @xmath112 and @xmath113 are indeterminant .",
    "of course , this does not preclude the possibility of an mhd numerical system evolving towards b - z , if the numerical problem is properly constructed @xcite . from a physical point of view",
    ", the strong forces that are responsible for compressing the flux down to the horizon still reside in the `` funnel walls , '' rendering the lateral boundaries as strong mhd pistons . in a realistic astrophysical setting , inertial forces in the lateral boundaries",
    "are likely to play an important role , or even a dominant role , in the determination of the jet power from the ehm .",
