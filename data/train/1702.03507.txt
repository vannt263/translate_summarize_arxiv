    "a cognitive radio ( cr ) has been considered as a promising technique to improve the efficiency of wireless spectrum by allowing the access of secondary users if the spectrum is under - utilized @xcite . in general , a secondary transmitter ( tx ) senses the medium before accessing the spectrum to check the level of its utilization . such a sensing mechanism triggered by a transmitter , however , has two major bottlenecks .",
    "first of all , it can not detect the existence of primary receivers ( rxs ) , making it difficult to protect the primary network .",
    "next , the interference level at the secondary tx differs from that at its rx where the transmitted signal actually encounters .",
    "there have been relatively many works to predict the locations of primary rxs as remedies of the first bottleneck @xcite but the difference of interference levels of secondary tx and rx has still remained under - explored .",
    "this is mainly because the distance between them has been regarded to be short enough to make the interference gap negligibly small  @xcite . in upcoming cr networks ,",
    "on the other hand , this distance can become longer i ) when a cellular system becomes the secondary network ( e.g. , license assisted access @xcite , public safety long - term evolution @xcite ) and ii ) when the secondary txs need to use dedicated spectrum sensors due to their low device form factor @xcite .",
    "this tendency brings about larger interference gap between the secondary tx and rx , increasing errors in detecting the spectrum access opportunities as shown in fig .",
    "[ system ] .    in view of tackling this issue",
    ", we propose a novel mac design called _ sense - and - predict _ ( sap ) in which each secondary tx opportunistically accesses the spectrum by predicting the level of interference at its rx .",
    "specifically , given the measured interference , a secondary tx computes the probability that the level of interference at its rx is less than the predetermined threshold , and decides whether to access or not with this probability . the interference predictability is closely related to the correlation of interference between two locations .",
    "when they are co - located , it is obvious that they meet the same level of interference .",
    "as the distance between the two becomes longer , the similarity decreases and finally they are independent .",
    "we figure out this spatial correlation in form of the conditional probability with the aid of stochastic geometry ( sg ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such a probabilistic approach based on sg plays a role to transform the real interference value to the level of the spectrum access opportunity in a stochastic manner .",
    "the measured interference level at tx per se can not provide an accurate prediction of interference level at rx because it depends on various parameters , such as the density of txs , transmit power et al .",
    "for instance , even though the measured interference at tx seems to be relatively high , there can be more access opportunities at rx especially when the density of txs is low .",
    "sg enables to reflect these kinds of parameters within one metric in a probabilistic form , which thus harmonizes with the operation of the proposed sap .    within the sap framework",
    ", we define an area spectral efficiency ( ase ) of the secondary network as the sum of throughput for secondary txs within a unit area , depending on the following two parameters .",
    "one is the access threshold to decide the access probability that we mentioned above .",
    "it affects the density of the concurrent secondary transmissions in the network , determining the level of the aggregate interference .",
    "the other is the minimum signal - to - interference ratio ( @xmath0 ) required for decoding the transmitted secondary signal , corresponding to the quality of each wireless link .",
    "note that there exist important design issues in which these two parameters are involved .",
    "for example , a small access threshold encourages the secondary tx to access the medium more frequently but reduces the transmission success probability due to higher aggregate interference . to compensate the loss",
    ", we can decrease the minimum @xmath0 but brings about the loss of each link quality . reflecting on these relations",
    ", we jointly optimize the two parameters to maximize secondary network ase while guaranteeing the protection of the primary network .    -10pt",
    "-15pt    * related works *  interference at neighboring nodes is sometimes measured analogously because their topological environments like interferers , reflectors , and scatterers are similar . traditionally , the spatial interference correlation has been interpreted as an obstacle required to be overcome , such as the reduction of degree - of - freedom in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communications when the antenna spacing is less than the half of wavelength @xcite . on the other hand , there are some trials to rather exploit the correlation for the purpose of enhancng the network performance . in @xcite and @xcite , for example , the spatial correlation is utilized to control the mobility of distributed robots .",
    "specifically , by predicting the interference level at a spatially separated location , each robot can reduce the number of channel measurements to find the adequate location guaranteeing sufficient throughput .",
    "the spatial interference correlation is in particular studied to improve the throughput of ad - hoc networks , where each node transmits in a distributed manner according to the local situation @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a spatially adaptive random access scheme is proposed , in which the transmitters in the ad - hoc network have different transmit probabilities due to the regional differences .",
    "the proposed scheme is validated to achieve better performance than the conventional aloha scheme where all txs access the spectrum with the same probability .",
    "in addition , the authors in @xcite take into account the spatial correlation between desired signal and interference in mimo ad - hoc networks .",
    "they design a mac protocol allowing concurrent transmissions most of which can be cancelled out due to the interference correlation .",
    "sg has been understood as an efficient tool to offer the tractability in modeling interference at a typical point in wireless networks @xcite . however , quantifying the spatial interference correlation with sg is far more challenging since the joint analysis of two spatial observations are required @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite and @xcite focus on the spatial interference correlation to analyze the link outage in ad - hoc network with sg . by extending these works ,",
    "the authors in @xcite derive the joint coverage probability at two spatial locations in a cellular network where mobile devices are moving .",
    "however , neither of them focus on the spatial interference dependency between secondary tx and rx in cr networks where the network analysis is more complicated due to the heterogeneity of primary and secondary networks .",
    "one of the goals of this paper thus is to fill this gap and provide useful insights for mac algorithm in cr networks .    * contributions and organization *  this paper proposes the sap in which given the channel sensing result , the access probability of each secondary tx is fine - tuned based on the _ predicted _ level of interference at its paired secondary rx .",
    "the main contributions are listed below .",
    "* by using sg , we derive the access probability , a probability that the received @xmath0 at a typical secondary rx exceeds a threshold under the condition of channel measurement at its paired tx , and its tight lower bound .",
    "the analytic result indicates that the access probability becomes totally independent of the interference measurement if the distance between secondary tx and rx is far enough . through the matlab simulation and testbed experiment utilizing universal software radio peripheral ( usrp )",
    ", we verify the access probability derivation and demonstrate that significant improvements are feasible . * the design guideline for the optimal access threshold and target @xmath0 for decoding is provided to maximize the ase while protecting the primary network .",
