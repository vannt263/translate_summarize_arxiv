    "the abundances of these metal - poor stars likely trace the nucleosynthetic output of the first population  iii ( pop  iii ) stars that enriched their host galaxy .",
    "since ufds have relatively simple star formation histories , they are a particularly powerful probe for dwarf galaxy archaeology , as all their stars formed from the same galactic environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this provides valuable constraints on the nature and site of the first nucleosynthesis events that can not be derived for field stars from the chemical signatures alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy has led to elemental abundance measurements of stars in ten different ufds .",
    "the overarching message is that , in most respects , stars in ufds are chemically similar to ordinary metal - poor halo stars . considering the population of ten ufds , the lowest metallicity stars tend to be carbon - enhanced , a likely signature of the first stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we use spectral synthesis to determine the abundance of c , sc , mn , sr , ba , and some lines of al and si . abundances of other elements are determined from equivalent width fitting , where the typical uncertainties are @xmath207 ( @xmath208 for tucii-006 , which has a noisier spectrum ) . table  [ tbl : stars ] reports our stellar parameters and abundances .",

    "as the majority of literature studies use lte abundances , our subsequent discussion focuses on the lte values . however , we consider nlte iron abundances when discussing the tuc  ii metallicity spread in section  [ s : tuchistory ] .",

    "in this region , the mike and m2fs spectra have comparable signal - to - noise ratios and spectral resolution . given the limited wavelength range , their stellar parameters are strongly influenced by a prior from photometry @xcite .",

    "when we use their stellar parameters and increase our metallicities by @xmath217dex , the [ fe / h ] abundances agree to within @xmath218dex for tucii-006 , tucii-033 , and tucii-052 , well within the statistical uncertainties",

    "otherwise , a difference between the sspp spectral grid ( which was synthesized with ` turbospectrum ` ) and moog for cooler stars may be responsible for the discrepancy .",
    "given our data quality , we consider most absorption lines below 4000 to be unreliable , although we have used a few strong and well - detected iron lines .",

    "all elemental abundances of tucii-006 and tucii-052 are consistent with being identical given the uncertainties , as might be expected if both stars formed from the same star cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the high abundance precision required to test the cluster hypothesis likely requires much higher s / n data that could be obtained with 30 m class telescopes ( e.g. , g - clef on the giant magellan telescope , @xcite ) .",

    "however , ufds complete @xmath252 of their star formation by @xmath253 @xcite and do not tend to accrete into larger systems until well after @xmath253 @xcite . consequently , their star formation history is probably more influenced by reionization than by environmental effects .",
