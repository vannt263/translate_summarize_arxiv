    "<S> small spherical ncs , the quantization gap between @xmath0 and @xmath1 levels leads to transfer of electrons from ncs with large number of donors to those without donors . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> empty ncs become extinct , and photoluminescence is quenched abruptly at an average number of donors per nc close to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative intensity of photoluminescence is shown to correlate with the type of hopping conductivity of an array of ncs .    </S>",
    "<S> semiconductor nanocrystals ( ncs ) can be used as building blocks for new solid materials with bulk properties which do not exist in conventional solids . from monodisperse </S>",
    "<S> spherical ncs one could assemble a closely packed nc solid with a three - dimensional ( 3d ) periodic structure with spacing between ncs much smaller than the nc diameter .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . like in bulk semiconductors , doping is critical for nc solids , which would otherwise be electrically insulating . adding charged carriers dramatically increases the electronic mobility of a nc array @xcite and opens new possibilities for many interesting applications , including field - effect transistors , light - emitting devices , photodetectors , and solar cells @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> due to intrinsic difficulties of nc doping by impurity atoms@xcite , the initial progress in the introduction of carriers into ncs was reached by putting the electron - donating molecules in the vicinity of the nc surface ( remote doping ) @xcite and applying external electric fields ( electrochemical doping ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only recently was a successful demonstration of the carrier introduced into a nc via electronic impurity doping reported @xcite . in order to improve transport properties of a 3d nc array by doping it with electronic impurity , </S>",
    "<S> at least the following three conditions must be satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> first , the intentionally introduced impurities should be shallow donors . </S>",
    "<S> second , a donor electron should be delocalized within a nc by the confinement potential . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is fulfilled if the nc diameter @xmath3 is smaller than six bohr radii of electrons , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the electron charge , @xmath6 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath7 is the effective electron mass of a semiconductor  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , the average number of deep surface states , which can trap an electron from the conduction band , should be significantly smaller than the average number of donors @xmath8 per nc . </S>",
    "<S> currently , surface traps in ncs still play a dominating role . </S>",
    "<S> but the number of traps is constantly decreasing due to improved technology . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the use of inorganic ligands drastically reduces the number of surface states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is time to study what can be achieved in a trap - free case .    </S>",
    "<S> for this ideal situation , the transport properties of a nc array have been studied theoretically as a function of the average number of donors @xmath8 and the nc diameter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that doping results in transport properties , which are typical for disordered semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the number of donors in different ncs is random . </S>",
    "<S> one could think that each nc has as many electrons as donors , so that all ncs remain neutral . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that in an array of small spherical ncs the quantization gap between the lowest @xmath0 and @xmath1 confinement levels leads to redistribution of electrons between ncs . due to the energy difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 levels , electrons from a nc with more than two donors , which in an isolated nc would occupy @xmath1 levels , </S>",
    "<S> are transferred to ncs with zero or one donors , which have unfilled @xmath0 levels . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the ground state of the nc array many ncs are charged . the charged ncs lead to the random coulomb potential and to the coulomb gap in the density of localized electron states that determines variable range hopping conductivity@xcite .    from an experimental point of view , it is interesting whether the effect of electron redistribution can be detected by quantum yield ( qy ) of photoluminescence ( pl ) of an array of ncs . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the extra electrons placed in ncs by shallow donors trigger the nonradiative auger recombination of a photoexcited electron - hole pair . </S>",
    "<S> in such a process , the annihilation energy of the electron - hole pair is transferred to an extra electron . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of nonradiative auger processes is much larger than the rate of the radiative recombination @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even one extra electron can quench photoluminescence from a nc with almost 100% probability . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , only empty ncs , i.e. the ones without an electron , contribute to the photoluminescence . </S>",
    "<S> a similar question of pl quenching by extra surface electrons induced by a gate is studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , while here we concentrate on pl quenching by electrons in the bulk array of ncs .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we calculated the fraction of empty ncs @xmath9 , which controls the pl quantum yield as a function of the average number of donors @xmath8 per nc and the nc size . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if @xmath8 reaches the critical value of @xmath2 , there are practically no empty ncs in a nc array due to electron redistribution between ncs , and consequently , pl vanishes almost completely . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations also show that the relative intensity of the pl is strongly correlated with the transport properties of these array . </S>",
    "<S> we have suggested an experiment which could provide important information about the redistribution of the charges between ncs affecting both qy of pl of an array of ncs and its hopping conductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> if ncs are neutral , the number of empty ncs is equal to the number of nc with no donors . </S>",
    "<S> when donors are added randomly to each nc , the probability @xmath10 that a given nc has exactly @xmath11 donors is given by the poisson distribution : @xmath12 therefore @xmath9 can be obtained from eq . at @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this `` poisson '' fraction is @xmath14 . below </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath9 gives only the upper bound for @xmath9 , so that , actually , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because electrons redistribute between ncs in order to minimize their total energy @xcite .    in order to calculate the fraction of empty ncs </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that ncs are identical spheres of diameter @xmath3 that form a three dimensional cubic lattice structure . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the overlap of electron states of neighboring ncs is so small that a small disorder originating from small fluctuations of diameters @xmath3 and a random coulomb potential ( see below ) leads to anderson localization of each electron in one of the ncs . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> each nc has exactly an integer number of electrons . at the same time , as we mentioned above , in the case @xmath16 , the wave function of a donor electron is delocalized within a nc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also suppose that the wave function is close to zero at the nc surface due to large confining potential barriers created by the insulator matrix surrounding ncs . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy @xmath17 of the @xmath18th electron added to a nc in the parabolic band approximation is :    @xmath19    as a result , the first two electrons added to a nc fill its @xmath0 level , the next six ones fill its @xmath1 level , and so on .    </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy of electrons is only a part of the total energy of a nc . </S>",
    "<S> one should add to it the total coulomb energy of donors and electrons and their interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in general , calculating the total coulomb energy of the system is a difficult problem , since the positions of positive donors are random within the nc s volume . for our problem , however , a significant simplification is available because the internal dielectric constant @xmath20 typically is much larger than both the external dielectric constant @xmath21 of the insulator in which the ncs are embedded and the overall effective dielectric constant @xmath22 of the array of ncs . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the large internal dielectric constant @xmath20 implies that any internal charge @xmath23 is essentially completely compensated by the nc dielectric response , which leads to homogeneous redistribution of the charge major part , @xmath24 , over the nc surface . in this way </S>",
    "<S> each semiconductor nc can be considered as a metallic one in terms of its coulomb interactions ; namely , total coulomb energy(self energy ) is equal to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these approximations are equivalent to the so - called constant interaction model , which is commonly used for individual quantum dots @xcite .    for illustration , </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss why in our approximation one can neglect a donor position dependent correction to the kinetic energy @xmath26 from coulomb interaction of an electron with a donor . </S>",
    "<S> this correction , by the order of magnitude , is equal to @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that if @xmath28 , this correction is always smaller than charging energy and therefore much smaller than the @xmath29-@xmath30 gap energy , which induces redistribution of electrons . for more detailed discussion of the energy of the system , </S>",
    "<S> see the appendix , where we show that the energy of a nc is completely determined by only two terms : quantum kinetic energy and self energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the gap @xmath31 between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 levels of a nc and the energy of adding one electron to a neutral nc @xmath32 , which we call the charging energy , are the two most important energies of our theory . </S>",
    "<S> below we use their ratio , @xmath33 which grows with decreasing nc diameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> let us estimate this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for example , cdse ncs with @xmath34 ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and @xmath35 nm arranged in a crystalline array with lattice constant @xmath36 nm . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the maxwell - garnett formula @xcite then gives @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the electron mass ) we have @xmath41 nm , @xmath42 ev and @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> we see that for the case of cdse our main approximation based on the inequality @xmath28 has only 30% accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> but this is the price for the relatively simple solution of an otherwise intractable problem of calculating the total energy depending on positions of all donors in non - uniform dielectric constant media . ignoring positions of donors , </S>",
    "<S> our solution preserves larger and more important effects of fluctuations of the number of donors in ncs @xcite . for other semiconductors </S>",
    "<S> the inequality @xmath28 can be much stronger . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for pbse , @xmath44 @xcite , and for the same @xmath3 and @xmath45 one gets @xmath46 resulting in 2% accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> we see from eq . </S>",
    "<S> that the range of applicability of our model , @xmath47 , for cdse ncs corresponds to @xmath48 . in principle , one can consider an array of ncs with even smaller @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where the ratio @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> in that case , one can expect no effects of @xmath52 on @xmath9 , so that @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see that at large @xmath54 electrons have to be redistributed between ncs , charging originally neutral ncs . </S>",
    "<S> imagine , for example , two neutral ncs of the same size , one with three donors and the other nc with no donors at all . in the @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> nc , two electrons occupy the @xmath0 level , and the third one occupies the @xmath1 level . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , in equilibrium the electron from the @xmath1 level of the first nc will move to the @xmath0 level of the second nc . </S>",
    "<S> even though this process charges both ncs , in the case @xmath54 the electron gains energy approximately equal to @xmath56 . in other words , the first nc acts as a donor , and the second one acts as an acceptor .    in order to calculate @xmath9 at any @xmath52 and to take into account the coulomb interaction between charged ncs </S>",
    "<S> , we model a 3d nc array with the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sum_{\\langle i , j \\rangle } \\frac{e^2 ( n_i - n_i)(n_j - n_j)}{\\kappa r_{ij } } , \\label{eq : h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 describes the charge of the @xmath59-th nc . </S>",
    "<S> the first term of the hamiltonian is the sum of self - energies of ncs , the second term describes the total quantum energy of @xmath60 electrons in the @xmath59th nc , and the last term is responsible for the coulomb interaction between different ncs . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between two ncs @xmath59 and @xmath61 at a distance @xmath62 is written as @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> such an approximation is obvious for a large distance @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> but one can show that even for two nearest neighbor ncs in a typical array , this approximation works well . for parameters @xmath35 nm and @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> nm the energy of interaction of the two nearest charged metallic spheres can be approximated as the interaction of two central point charges @xmath63 with an accuracy of 1% . of course , the same statement is applicable for two nearest neighbor ncs if @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to find the fraction of empty ncs @xmath9 in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> such a state is defined by the set of electron occupation numbers @xmath66 that minimize the hamiltonian @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate a finite , cubic array of @xmath68 ncs and use the approach outlined in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to calculate the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> first , we specify @xmath8 and the total number of donors in our system @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> then we assign a random donor number @xmath70 for each nc @xmath59 according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : poisson ] ) and the condition @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial values of the electron numbers @xmath72 are then assigned randomly in such a way that the system is overall neutral , i.e. , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the program then searches for the ground state by looping over all nc pairs @xmath74 and attempting to move one electron from @xmath59 to @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> if the move lowers the hamiltonian @xmath67 , then it is accepted ; otherwise , it is rejected . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we arrive at a pseudoground state , which describes the nc array at low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , the number of empty ncs in the pseudoground state is averaged over 50 different realizations of the random initial arrays of donors numbers @xmath70 .     in an array of doped ncs on the average number of donors per nc @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath9 is normalized to the fraction of undoped ncs which is described by the poisson distribution : @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were conducted for several ratios of the @xmath0-@xmath1 gap to the charging energy , @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are shown by symbols connected by eye guiding thin lines . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the points reflects a calculation uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solution for the case @xmath54 is shown by the solid black line . ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : empty ] we show the results of a numerical simulation for the fraction of empty ncs @xmath9 for different @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> recall that the fraction of empty donors is proportional to the qy of pl . </S>",
    "<S> we limit the plot to the range @xmath76 because , as we show below , at @xmath77 qy is already determined by filled nc . in the limit @xmath78 , </S>",
    "<S> the system remains nearly uniformly neutral due to an extreme scarcity of nc with @xmath79 , which can provide electrons to @xmath80 ncs . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , at small @xmath8 the fraction of nc with @xmath79 is @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath9 and @xmath82 increases at @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we see that for the case @xmath84 the fraction @xmath9 vanishes almost completely at @xmath85 .    in order to understand our numerical result </S>",
    "<S> let us find analytically @xmath9 for the limit @xmath54 ( using hamiltonian @xmath67 without the last term of eq .   ) . in this case , all the electrons from @xmath1 , @xmath86 ... levels of ncs with @xmath87 ( which we call excessive electrons ) tend to occupy the @xmath0 level in ncs with @xmath13 and 1 . </S>",
    "<S> let us start from small enough @xmath8 when all excessive electrons can still find places in 1s level in ncs with @xmath80 . as shown above , a nc with @xmath55 donors </S>",
    "<S> provides one excessive electron . in general , a nc with @xmath88 provides @xmath89 excessive electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of excessive electrons @xmath90 per nc can be readily derived :    @xmath91    neutral ncs with @xmath92 have a filled @xmath0 level and have no @xmath1 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> unoccupied @xmath0 states are available only in ncs with @xmath13 and @xmath93 , and excessive electrons could move to one of these ncs . </S>",
    "<S> ( recall that an @xmath93 nc has one electron before electrons redistribute between ncs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first states to fill are the two lowest energy states , namely , the first electron state in the @xmath13 nc and the second electron state in the @xmath93 nc . indeed , according to hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , there is no energy difference between the first electron state in the @xmath13 nc and the second electron state in the @xmath93 nc , but bringing the second electron to an n=0 nc requires more energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the first electron state in the @xmath13 nc and the second electron state in the @xmath93 nc share excessive electrons proportional to their fractions @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the array . as a result , the probability to find an excessive electron in the @xmath13 ncs is proportional to the fraction of such ncs @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath97 , we arrive at    @xmath98    here , the first term is the fraction of the @xmath13 , ncs and the second term describes the number of them lost due to filling by excessive electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath9 obtained for @xmath54 ( eq .  ) is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : empty ] by the full line . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that @xmath9 vanishes at @xmath99 and @xmath100 at @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the numerical result for @xmath84 is close to our analytical result for @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the long range random potential originating from the last term of eq .   and </S>",
    "<S> so far ignored leads to the avoided threshold in the vicinity @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> curves for smaller @xmath52 show how the @xmath1-@xmath0 gap - induced carrier redistribution weakens and @xmath9 approaches @xmath82 .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to try to quantify the charge redistribution , we call arrays of ncs in which @xmath103 `` bright '' , while we call nc arrays obeying the opposite inequality @xmath104 `` dark '' . with this definition fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : empty ] implies that a nc array is dark for @xmath105 and @xmath106 and is bright otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to note a correlation between these results and the main phase diagram of the hopping transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the same model of the array of ncs , it was shown in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the conductivity is described by the efros - shklovskii variable range hopping law for @xmath107 and @xmath108 and the thermally activated nearest - neighbor hopping law in other cases . thus there is a correlation between qy and the conductivity of an array of ncs . </S>",
    "<S> one should expect the efros - shklovskii law in a dark nc array , while the thermally - activated law should be expected in a bright nc array . </S>",
    "<S> there are also strong correlations between the brightness and photoconductivity of the nc array . </S>",
    "<S> an extra electron that quenches the pl in a nc leaves that nc and can be involved in photoconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is complementarity between pl and photoconductivity in arrays of ncs . </S>",
    "<S> when pl is quenched and a nc array is dark , the photoconductivity is strong and vice versa .    until now we have neglected completely the radiative decay of charged nc , assuming that the ratio , @xmath109 , of the radiative recombination rate to the auger rate for a nc with one extra electron is very small , namely @xmath110 .    </S>",
    "<S> at relatively large @xmath111 the fraction of empty ncs @xmath9 becomes very small . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , we have to take into account pl from ncs with electrons ( filled ncs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume below that the rate of the auger process linearly increases with the number of electrons in a nc , @xmath18 , so that the qy from this nc is proportional to @xmath112 . thus , the normalized to undoped nc array qy of all filled ncs @xmath113 is    @xmath114    here , @xmath115 is the fraction of ncs with @xmath18 electrons in the nc array . at small @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> there is no electron redistribution in the array of ncs , i.e. @xmath116 , and we can use the poisson distribution of eq .   for @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath117 the function @xmath118 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fillled ] by the dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that in the range of @xmath119 @xmath120 , is close to @xmath121 .     </S>",
    "<S> related to the qy of an undoped array , on the average number of donors per nc @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were conducted for the ratios of the @xmath0-@xmath1 gaps to the charging energies @xmath122 and 5 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are shown by circles and squares connected by eye guiding thin lines . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the circles and squares reflects a calculation uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical dependence of @xmath123 calculated for @xmath124 according to eq . is shown by the dashed line . ]    in order to study the role of the redistribution of electrons at larger @xmath52 we simulated the ground state of electrons in an array of ncs and computed the distribution function @xmath115 averaged over ten realizations of a @xmath125 nc array . </S>",
    "<S> then we calculated @xmath126 for @xmath127 and @xmath128 according to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fillled ] . </S>",
    "<S> we found that at small @xmath127 our @xmath126 practically coincides with @xmath120 , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , our numerical result for @xmath113 for @xmath128 does not differ from eq .   by more than by @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> one can understand this in the following way . at small @xmath130 </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of nc with @xmath131 is small ; there is no electron redistribution between ncs regardless of the value of @xmath52 , and therefore @xmath132 . at @xmath133 , </S>",
    "<S> many ncs have two electrons either because they have two donors or because of electron redistribution between @xmath55 ncs and @xmath93 ncs . in that case </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate qy of pl from these ncs as @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for any @xmath52 one can say that the contribution of filled ncs is roughly @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is close to @xmath137 in the range of @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> to find at what @xmath8 all the filled ncs begin to contribute to qy more than empty ones we equate @xmath9 and @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath128 and @xmath140 this happens at @xmath141 , while at @xmath142 filled ncs win at @xmath143 .    </S>",
    "<S> although all the numerical and analytical results of this paper are derived under the assumption that temperature @xmath144 , our theory is applicable for any reasonable temperature </S>",
    "<S> . the theoretical restrictions of our theory on the temperature are @xmath145 , which means @xmath146k , for example , in the case of an array of cdse ncs with @xmath147 nm , for which @xmath148 ev .    </S>",
    "<S> we also neglect completely the dispersion of nc size . </S>",
    "<S> our theory , however , can be used also in the nc array with dispersion of nc size if the typical fluctuation of the ground state energy is smaller than the charging energy . in the closely packed array of ncs </S>",
    "<S> this dispersion could not be higher than 5% because the latter would prevent formation of the ordered nc array @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the 5% fluctuation of the nc sizes results in the fluctuation of the @xmath0-@xmath1 gap @xmath56 , whose magnitude can be estimated as @xmath149 in the parabolic band approximation . for a such nc array </S>",
    "<S> this means @xmath150 , or @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> the last condition is satisfied in practically all interesting cases .    </S>",
    "<S> one needs to note that pl could also be quenched by the foster resonant energy transfer ( fret ) of the exciton from an empty nc to neighboring ncs with electrons , where this exciton undergoes the fast non - radiative auger recombination @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the fret time to be shorter than the exciton radiative recombination time . </S>",
    "<S> the exciton can not be transferred to a nc which has more than one electron because significant additional energy equal the 1s-1p gap is required for such a transition . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the third electron could occupy only the @xmath1 electron level . </S>",
    "<S> this energy restriction does not exist for ncs with one electron , and at a first glance , the fret could be as efficient as in transitions between empty ncs . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the fret between the empty ncs and ncs with one electron shows , however , that this is not the case because the fast non - radiative auger decay rate @xmath152 of an exciton in ncs with one electron suppresses the fret rate . </S>",
    "<S> the fret rate in the last case is equal to @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the foster matrix element that describes coupling between the exciton state in empty ncs and ncs with one electron @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that fret time , which for empty ncs is on the order 310ns , is actually much longer than this value because @xmath155 .    the theory we developed deals with spherical ncs with a non - degenerate parabolic electron spectrum , which exist , for example , in cdse ncs . </S>",
    "<S> in ncs made of semiconductors with several degenerate conduction band minima , for example , pbs , pbse , and ge with four degenerate ellipsoids , the @xmath0-level accommodates @xmath156 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the redistribution of electrons due to the 1s-1p gap at @xmath8 = 8 does not affect qy because the fraction of ncs with @xmath13 at such @xmath8 is practically equal to zero ( recall that @xmath157 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , in pbs , pbse , and ge ncs , the @xmath0-level is split by the surface potential into two levels with degeneracies of 2 and 6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can therefore use our theory to describe pl in the range of @xmath158 in pbs , pbse , and ge ncs using this smaller gap . </S>",
    "<S> if this gap results in @xmath159 , we arrive at @xmath160 .    </S>",
    "<S> the gap value is always critical for the carrier redistribution . in large spherical ncs made of </S>",
    "<S> non - degenerate single - band semiconductors the 1s-1p gap decreases faster with growing size than the charging energy . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to @xmath159 , and we again end up with @xmath160 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective gap can be significantly reduced even in small ncs , whose shape substantially deviates from the spherical . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting of the @xmath1 levels in such structures creates several substantially narrower gaps instead of one big one , which results in @xmath160 .    </S>",
    "<S> we would like to suggest an experiment which could allow one to study the carrier redistribution in an array of doped ncs . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the time dependence of the pl intensity after the short pulse excitation should allow measurement of the hopping time between ncs in a nc array . in equilibrium the fraction of empty nc is determined by @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> photo - excitation of ncs with electrons triggers the non - radiative auger processes , which ionize ncs , creating excited , almost free electrons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these electrons are captured back by ncs randomly . </S>",
    "<S> this fast process leads to the redistribution of carriers and increases the number of empty ncs . </S>",
    "<S> their fraction again is determined by poisson distribution @xmath82 , which in turn increases the pl intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation to the equilibrium distribution function @xmath9 is much slower and is controlled by the hopping time between ncs with three electrons and ncs with no electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the effect could be measured by the pump probe experimental technique in a nc array with low mobility , where the hopping time is much longer than the exciton decay time . </S>",
    "<S> the first short , intense pump pulse initially creates a non - equilibrium distribution of empty ncs @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation of the electrons to the equilibrium distribution @xmath9 could be measured with the help of the time dependence of the pl intensity excited by the probe pulse .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , this paper has shown that in an array of small ncs due to the quantization gap induced redistribution of electrons among ncs , empty ncs responsible for pl become extinct at an average number of donors per nc equal to 1.8 , leading to abrupt quenching of pl .    </S>",
