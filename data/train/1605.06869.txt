    "multiferroic materials exhibit the co - existence of multiple ordering , such as ferroelectricity , ferromagnetism , and ferroelasticity.@xcite multiferroic properties observed in manganese ( mn)-based oxides@xcite and iron ( fe)-based oxides@xcite have stimulated much research on multiferroic transition - metal oxides not only due to the potential technical application but also due to the scientific interest . as an attempt to achieve both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism ,",
    "fe - doped bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4 has been investigated by substituting ferromagnetic fe ions in hexagonal ferroelectric batio@xmath4.@xcite room - temperature ferromagnetism has been observed in bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4 ( @xmath17),@xcite and both tetragonal and hexagonal phases exist in bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4 ceramics .",
    "the saturation magnetization and the magnetic coercivity were found to depend on the doping level as well as the fraction of the hexagonal phase in the ceramics.@xcite . in bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4 system ,",
    "oxygen vacancy defects and the valence states of the substituted fe ions are expected to be important in determining the magnetic and ferroelectric properties of the system.@xcite however , the reproducibility of multiferroicity and the effect of the oxygen vacancy in bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4 need be investigated more systematically .    despite extensive studies on multiferroic transition - metal ( tm ) oxides ,",
    "the origin of the multiferroicity has not been well understood yet . based on the xrd ( x - ray diffraction ) analysis of bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4,@xcite the coexistence of fe@xmath10 and fe@xmath7 ions",
    "was suggested , implying the availablity of the exchange interactions among fe@xmath10-fe@xmath7 , fe@xmath10-fe@xmath10 , and fe@xmath7-fe@xmath7 .",
    "further , the fe @xmath18-edge xanes ( x - ray absorption near - edge structures ) study for bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4@xcite have shown that both fe@xmath10 and fe@xmath7 ions exist in bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4 , with the maximum valence states at @xmath19 .",
    "but xrd is not an element - specific experimental method that can determine the valence states of the constituent ions directly . on the other hand ,",
    "fe @xmath18-edge xanes arises mainly from the fe @xmath20 absorption , and so fe @xmath18-edge xanes does not directly represent the fe @xmath21 configuration in the ground state of fe ions .",
    "recently , the effect of the simultaneous substitutions of trivalent bi@xmath10 ions for divalent ba@xmath9 ions and trivalent fe@xmath10 ( or tetravalent fe@xmath7 ) ions for tetravalent ti@xmath7 ions in ba@xmath0bi@xmath1ti@xmath22fe@xmath23o@xmath4 has been investigated.@xcite similarly as in bati@xmath0fe@xmath16o@xmath4 , the valence states of fe ions are expected to play a very important role in ba@xmath0bi@xmath1ti@xmath22fe@xmath23o@xmath4 .",
    "hence , in order to understand the origin of multiferroicity , it is crucial to determine the valence states of fe ions directly by using element - specific experimental methods . in this aspect , soft x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas )",
    "is a powerful experimental tool for studying the valence states of tm ions in solids.@xcite    in this work , we have investigated the electronic structures of ba@xmath0bi@xmath1ti@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) by employing photoemission spectroscopy ( pes ) and xas .",
    "pes provides a direct observation of the occupied part of the electronic structures.@xcite tm @xmath24-edge ( @xmath6 ) xas involves the @xmath25 absorption , and so it is a very powerful experimental tool for studying the element - specific valence and spin states of tm ions in solids.@xcite",
    "polycrystalline ba@xmath0bi@xmath1ti@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) samples were synthesized by using solid - state reaction methods.@xcite pes measurements were performed at the 8a1 beam line , and xas measurements were performed at both the 8a1 and 2a beam lines of the pohang light source ( pls ) .",
    "the base pressure of the xas / pes chamber was better than @xmath26 torr .",
    "xas and pes spectra were obtained at room temperature .",
    "xas data were obtained by employing the total electron yield mode with the photon energy resolution of @xmath27 mev at @xmath28 ev .",
    "the overall instrumental resolution of the pes spectra was about @xmath29 ev at @xmath30 ev .",
    "all the xas spectra were normalized to the incident photon flux .",
    "figure  [ pes ] shows the survey pes spectra of ba@xmath0bi@xmath16ti@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 for @xmath8=0.1 and 0.12 , which are shown in the binding energy ( be ) scale .",
    "these pes spectra are obtained with @xmath31 ev .",
    "here we have chosen to show the samples with high bi concentrations because they can reveal both ba- and bi - related peaks .",
    "all the characteristic core - level peaks of ba@xmath0bi@xmath16ti@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 are observed in the measured survey pes spectra , such as o @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ev ) , ti @xmath6 ( @xmath34 ev ) , bi @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ev ) , and ba @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ev ) core levels .",
    "the large peak around @xmath39 ev is the c @xmath32 core - level peak , which is often observed in polycrystalline samples .",
    "this carbon peak is likely to be due to the impurity carbons present in the grain boundaries of polycrystalline samples , which are not involved in bonding of the solids and do not affect the physical properties the samples .",

    "such a trend in ba@xmath0bi@xmath16ti@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 and the relative magnitudes with the reference fe oxides indicate that , in @xmath8=0 ( bati@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ) , fe ions are nearly trivalent ( fe@xmath10 ) , and that , with the substitution of bi ions for ba ions ( @xmath11 ) , the fe@xmath9 component appears , resulting in fe@xmath9-fe@xmath10 mixed - valent states . for @xmath8=0.12 ( ba@xmath57bi@xmath58ti@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ) ,",
