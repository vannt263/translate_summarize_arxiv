    "graph - based codes , such as low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) , turbo , and repeat - accumulate codes , together with belief propagation ( bp ) decoding have shown to perform extremely close to the shannon limit with reasonable decoding complexity  @xcite .",
    "these graph - based codes can be represented by a bipartite tanner graph in which the variable and check nodes respectively correspond to the codewords symbols and the parity check constraints  @xcite .",
    "the error - correcting performance of a code is mainly characterized by the connectivity among the nodes in the tanner graph where the node degree plays an important role . to specify the node degree distribution in the tanner graph ,",
    "the concept of degree distribution in either node perspective or edge perspective is introduced  @xcite .",
    "a code ensemble is then defined as the set of all codes with a particular degree distribution . as a unifying framework for graph - based codes , richardson and urbanke  @xcite proposed multi - edge type low density parity - check ( met - ldpc ) codes .",
    "the benefit of the met generalization is greater flexibility in the code structure , which can improve decoding performances .",
    "this generalization is particularly useful under traditionally difficult requirements , such as high - rate codes with very low error floors or low - rate codes  @xcite .    a numerical technique , referred to as density evolution ( de ) ,",
    "was formulated to analyze the convergence behavior of the bp decoder ( i.e. , the code threshold ) for a given ldpc  @xcite or met - ldpc  @xcite code ensemble under bp decoding , where the code threshold is defined as the maximum channel noise level at which the decoding error probability converges to zero as the code length goes to infinity .",
    "de determines the performance of bp decoding for a given code ensemble by tracking the probability density function ( pdf ) of messages passed along the edges in the corresponding tanner graph through the iterative decoding process .",
    "then , it is possible to test whether , for a given channel condition and a given degree distribution , the decoder can successfully decode the transmitted message ( with the decoding error probability tends to zero as the iterations progress ) .",
    "this allows us to design and optimize ldpc and met - ldpc degree distributions using the de threshold ( i.e. , the code threshold found using de ) as the cost function .    calculating thresholds and designing ldpc and met - ldpc degree distributions using de are computationally intensive as they require numerical evaluations of the pdfs of the messages passed along the tanner graph edges in each decoding iteration . because of this , for ldpc codes on the binary input additive white gaussian noise ( bi - awgn ) channel , chung  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite and lehmann and maggio  @xcite approximated the message pdfs by gaussian pdfs , each using a single parameter , to simplify the analysis .",
    "existing work concerning gaussian approximations has relied on four different parameters in order to obtain a single - parameter model of the message pdfs , including mean value of the pdf  @xcite , bit - error rate ( ber )  @xcite , reciprocal - channel approximation ( rca )  @xcite and mutual information ( e.g. , exit charts )  @xcite .",
    "several papers  @xcite have investigated the accuracy of the gaussian approximation for bp decoding of standard ldpc codes and shown that it is accurate for medium - to - high rates .",

    ", the quantized pdfs of the messages are passed along the edges without any approximation .",

    "schmalen and brink  @xcite have used the gaussian approximation based on the mean of the message pdf  @xcite to evaluate the behavior of protograph based ldpc codes , which is a subset of met - ldpc codes .",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows : 1 ) we investigate the accuracy of gaussian approximations for bp decoding .",
    "we follow the approximation techniques suggested for ldpc codes  @xcite , which describe each de - message pdf using a single parameter . based on our observations of the evolution of pdfs in the met - ldpc codes",
    ", we found that those gaussian approximations are not accurate for the scenarios where met - ldpc codes are useful , i.e. , at low rate and with punctured variable nodes .",
    "2 ) in light of this , we propose a hybrid - de method , which combines the full - de and a gaussian approximation .",
    "our proposed hybrid - de allows us to evaluate the code threshold ( i.e. , the cost function in the code optimization ) of met - ldpc and ldpc code ensembles significantly faster than the full - de and with accuracy better than gaussian approximations .",
    "3 ) we design good met - ldpc codes using the proposed hybrid - de and show that the hybrid - de well approximates the full - de for code design .",

    "unlike standard ldpc code ensembles where the graph connectivity is constrained only by the node degrees , in the multi - edge setting , several edge - types can be defined , and every node is characterized by the number of connections to edges of each edge - type . within this framework",

    "messages are passed along the edges of the tanner graph from variable nodes to their incident check nodes and vice versa until a valid codeword is found or a predefined maximum number of decoding iterations has been reached .",
    "each bp decoding iteration involves two steps .    1 .   a variable node processes the messages it receives from its neighboring check nodes and from its corresponding channel and outputs messages to its neighboring check nodes .",
    "a check node processes inputs from its neighboring variable nodes and passes messages back to its neighboring variable nodes .    in most cases of binary codes transmitted on bi - awgn channel , these",
    "bp decoding messages are expressed as log - likelihood ratios ( llrs )  @xcite .",
    "this is used to reduce the complexity of the bp decoder , as multiplication of message probabilities corresponds to the summation of corresponding llrs .",

    "the assumption in step 2 ( see remark  [ remark_lognormal sum ] ) , that is the sum of @xmath136 independent lognormal random variables can be well approximated by another lognormal random variable , is clearly not true if the check node degree is large ( see remark  [ remark_lognormal sum_not_correct ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath138 may not follow a gaussian distribution for larger the check node degrees .    to evaluate the combined effect of the snr and the check node degree , we plot the kl divergence of check - to - variable message pdfs to the corresponding symmetric gaussian pdfs for a rate @xmath156 met - ldpc code at the first decoding iteration for different snrs and different check node degrees in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrandcheckdegree ] .",
    "our simulations show that with a large check node degree of 15 , the kl divergence is large . based on this",
    "we claim that single - parameter gaussian approximations may not be a good approximation to de for codes with large check node degrees .",
    "+      one of the modifications of met - ldpc codes over standard ldpc codes is the addition of punctured variable nodes to improve the code threshold ( a different use of puncturing than its typical use to increase the rate ) .",
    "we observe that these punctured nodes have a significant impact on the accuracy of the gaussian approximation of both variable - to - check messages and check - to - variable messages .",
    "according to theorem  [ variable node update ] , if @xmath120s are not gaussian , the pdf of the variable - to - check messages ( @xmath119 ) converges to a gaussian distribution as the variable node degree tends to infinity . in the case of punctured nodes",
    ", @xmath39 equals zeros as punctured bits are not transmitted through a channel .",
    "hence in punctured variable nodes , @xmath119 is equivalent to the sum of @xmath120s only , which are heavily non gaussian at early decoding iterations .",
    "thus if the variable node degree is not large enough , then @xmath119 from punctured variable nodes may not follow a gaussian distribution at early decoding iterations .",
    "the punctured variable nodes adversely affect the check - to - variable messages as well . according to remark  [ check node update ]",
    ", the pdf of the check - to - variable messages ( @xmath138 ) can be well approximated by a gaussian pdf , if the variable - to - check messages ( @xmath143s ) are well approximated by a gaussian pdf .",
    "this is because , @xmath144 in step 1 of ( [ check update 2 ] ) follows an approximate lognormal distribution only if @xmath119 is following a gaussian distribution . since @xmath119 from a punctured variable node",
    "does not follow a gaussian distribution , @xmath138 also may not follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "the end result is that punctured nodes reduce the validity of the gaussian approximation for @xmath119 and @xmath138 .    to illustrate the effect of punctured nodes via an example , we plot the kl divergence of variable - to - check and check - to - variable messages to the corresponding symmetric gaussian pdfs of rate a @xmath30 met - ldpc code with punctured nodes in fig .  [",
    "fig : kl_p ] .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : kl_varibale_p ] that the kl divergence of the variable - to - check message to the corresponding symmetric gaussian pdf from punctured nodes has a larger value than that from the unpunctured nodes in the same code .",
    "[ fig : kl_check_p ] shows the corresponding effect on the kl divergence of the check - to - variable messages .",
    "furthermore , the decrease of the kl divergence with decoding iterations in fig .",
    "[ fig : kl_p ] implies that @xmath119 and @xmath138 are following a gaussian distribution at later decoding iterations .",
    "however in general , to become gaussian it takes more decoding iterations than typical for a code without punctured nodes .",
    "one of the advantages of the met - ldpc codes is the addition of degree - one variable nodes to improve the code threshold .",
    "however we observe that degree - one variable nodes can affect the gaussian approximation for the check - to - variable messages . here",
    "we explain the reason behind this , based on the assumptions required for gaussian approximations to be accurate .    according to remark  [ check node update ]",
    ", the pdf of the check - to - variable messages ( @xmath138 ) can be well approximated by a gaussian pdf , if the variable - to - check messages ( @xmath143s ) are reasonably reliable given that @xmath143 are gaussian .",
    "even though @xmath143s received from edges connected to degree - one variable nodes are gaussian , they are not reasonably reliable .",
    "this is because variable nodes of degree - one never update their @xmath143s as they do not receive information from more than one neighboring check node .",
    "so the @xmath138s may not follow gaussian distribution .",
    "consequently , this may reduce the validity of the gaussian approximation to de for met - ldpc codes .",
    "similarly any check node that receives input messages from a degree - one variable node never outputs a distribution with an infinitely large mean in any of its edge messages updated with information from degree - one variable nodes .",
    "this is because , if @xmath158 are a set of independent random variables , then @xmath159 and @xmath160 as @xmath161 \\rightarrow \\infty$ ]  @xcite , as is the case with degree - one variable nodes .",
    "we observed through the simulations that the degree - one variable nodes have a small impact on the accuracy of the gaussian approximation of both variable - to - check messages and check - to - variable messages .",
    "all the gaussian approximations we discussed in section  [ gaussian app ] are based on the assumption that the pdfs of the variable - to - check and the check - to - variable messages can be well approximated by symmetric gaussian distributions .",
    "this assumption is quite accurate at the later decoding iterations , but least accurate in the early decoding iterations particularly at low snrs or with punctured variable nodes or with large check node degrees as we have observed in section  [ validity of ga ] .",
    "making the assumption of symmetric gaussian distributions at the beginning of the de calculation produces large errors between the estimated and true distributions .",
    "even when the true distributions do become gaussian , the approximations give incorrect gaussian distributions due to the earlier errors .",
    "these errors propagate throughout the de calculation and cause significant errors in the final code threshold result for met - ldpc codes as we will see in section  [ code design ga ] . through simulations , we observed that , when the channel snr is above the code threshold , the pdfs of the node messages ( i.e. , variable - to - check and the check - to - variable messages ) eventually do become symmetric gaussian distributions as decoding iterations proceeds .",
    "this implies that making the assumption of symmetric gaussian distributions in the later decoding iterations of the de calculation is reasonable .",
    "this motivates us to propose a hybrid density evolution ( hybrid - de ) algorithm for met - ldpc codes which is a combination of the full - de and the mean - based gaussian approximation ( approximation 1 ) .",
    "the key idea in hybrid - de is that we do not assume that the node messages are symmetric gaussian at the beginning of the de calculation , i.e. , hybrid - de method initializes the node message pdfs using the full - de and then switches to the gaussian approximation .",
    "there are two options for switching from the full - de to the gaussian approximation . as option one",
    ", we can impose a limitation for the number of maximum full - de iterations in hybrid - de , in which we do few full - de iterations and then switch to the gaussian approximation .",
    "although this is the simplest option , it gives a nice trade - off between accuracy and efficiency of threshold computation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : met_threshold_it ] .",
    "the second option is that we can switch from full - de to the gaussian approximation after that the pdfs for the node messages become nearly symmetric gaussian .",
    "the kl divergence  @xcite can be used to check whether a message pdf is close to a symmetric gaussian distribution .",
    "thus , as the second option , we can impose a limitation for the kl divergence between the actual node message pdf and a symmetric gaussian pdf .",
    "this is a more accurate way of switching than option one . because the value of the kl divergence depends on the shape of the pdf of the node messages , thus the switching point is changing appropriately with the condition ( such as snr , code rate ) we are looking at .",
    "each option has its own pros and cons .",
    "for instance , if the channel snr is well above the code threshold , the node messages can be close to a symmetric gaussian distribution before the imposed limit in option one for the full - de iterations .",
    "thus we are doing extra full - de iterations that are not necessary .",
    "this reduces the benefit of hybrid - de by adding extra run - time . in such a situation",
    ", we can introduce the second option ( i.e. , kl divergence limit ) in addition to reduce run - time by halting the full - de iterations once the pdf is sufficiently gaussian . on the other hand ,",
    "if the channel snr is below the code threshold , the decoder never converge to a zero - error probability as decoding iterations proceed , thus node messages may not ever follow a symmetric gaussian distribution .",
    "this makes the option two hybrid - de always remain at full - de , as it never meets the target kl divergence limit . thus forcing a limitation for the number of full - de iterations ( i.e. , option one ) is required in order to improve the run - time of hybrid - de . because of these reasons",
    ", we can introduce both options to the hybrid - de where option one acts as a hard limit and option two acts as a soft limit .",
    "this is a particularly beneficial way to do the trade - off between accuracy and efficiency when computing the code threshold .",
    "we found that it is possible to impose both options in the hybrid - de to significantly improve computational time without significantly reducing the accuracy of the threshold calculation .",
