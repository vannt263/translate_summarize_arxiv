    "the asymmetry in the rapidity - dependent cross section for weak ( @xmath0 ) boson production in unpolarized high - energy @xmath1 collisions is a valuable instrument  @xcite for measuring the bjorken @xmath2 dependence of the ratio @xmath3 of the up - quark and down - quark quark parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in a proton at the very hard scale set by the weak boson mass @xmath4 .",
    "demonstration of the utility of this prediction awaited sufficient luminosity @xcite , but it was not long before the measured rapidity asymmetries were used routinely in global analyses as important constraints on unpolarized pdfs @xcite .",
    "the method relies on the accepted drell - yan mechanism by which the @xmath5 boson is produced in the standard model , e.g. , principally @xmath6 and @xmath7 at leading order in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) perturbation theory .",
    "thus , at least qualitatively , a @xmath8 moving with a large rapidity @xmath9 is produced from projectile @xmath10 quarks carrying large @xmath2 , whereas a @xmath11 moving with a large @xmath9 is produced from projectile @xmath12 quarks carrying large @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio of the unpolarized @xmath8 and @xmath11 cross sections at large @xmath9 thus provides important constraints on the ratio @xmath3 at @xmath2 between 0.1 and 1 .",
    "extension of similar arguments to polarized @xmath13 scattering  @xcite adds a promise of direct access to the longitudinal spin - dependent quark pdfs @xmath14 via the @xmath15 coupling of the quark constituents to the @xmath0 .",
    "only one of the incident protons need be longitudinally polarized in order for this parity - violating measurement to be effective . in this paper",
    "we address @xmath0 production in longitudinally polarized proton collisions at the brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at collision energy @xmath16 gev  @xcite .",
    "we focus on the dijet decay mode of the @xmath0 , @xmath17 , and compute fully differential cross sections in jet pair invariant mass @xmath18 , jet pair rapidity @xmath9 , and jet transverse momentum @xmath19 for all signal and background processes .",
    "the parity - violating dijet production cross section , @xmath20 where @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) represents a proton with its spin aligned with ( against ) the proton s direction of motion , is dominated by the @xmath23 process .",
    "the single - spin asymmetry @xmath24 ( as a function of the rapidity @xmath9 ) is sensitive to @xmath25 at @xmath26 at large positive @xmath9 values , and to @xmath27 at @xmath28 at large negative @xmath9 values , as we demonstrate quantitatively . both @xmath29 and @xmath30 pdfs are not known well in the quoted @xmath2 regions , as they are not constrained by the existing data ( mostly from polarized deep inelastic scattering ) .",
    "the dijet asymmetry @xmath31 may probe these pdfs with a relatively small event sample .",
    "commonly one detects a @xmath0 boson by observing a leptonic decay @xmath32 , with its characteristic jacobian peak in the transverse momentum @xmath33 of the charged leptons @xmath34 or @xmath35 , and the missing transverse energy carried by the invisible neutrino @xmath36 .",

    "e.g. , _ ref .",
    "the lepton decay mode is observable at all colliders , including rhic @xcite .",
    "such signals are clean and impose tight constraints on the pdfs , but the small decay branching fraction penalty is felt keenly in the event rate .",
    "the luminosity in polarized proton scattering tends to be less than in the unpolarized case , and the @xmath0 production cross section at the envisioned rhic center - of - mass energy is not as great as at a higher - energy collider . correspondingly , lepton decay events come at a premium and most likely would require several years of rhic running . with this in mind , it is attractive to investigate the _ a priori _ disfavored alternative that one could observe @xmath0 production in the hadronic decay mode @xmath37 @xcite , precisely the topic of this paper .",
    "an advantage of the hadronic @xmath0 decay compared to the leptonic decay is a larger cross section , enhanced by @xmath38 .",
    "another advantage is the possibility to directly determine the invariant mass and rapidity of the @xmath0 boson , approximately equal in this case to the invariant mass ( @xmath18 ) and rapidity ( @xmath9 ) of the high-@xmath33 jet pair .",
    "the boson - level @xmath9 distribution does not suffer from the smearing of the pdf dependence in the charged - lepton distributions @xcite caused by spin correlations in the course of the @xmath0 boson decay .",
    "the hadronic decay mode of the @xmath0 boson has an admitted drawback in that background contributions to jet pair production are substantial .",
    "hadronic jets are produced most abundantly through qcd and electromagnetic ( virtual photon ) interactions , rather than through @xmath0 interactions , especially via the scattering involving real gluons , which grows rapidly with collider energy .",
    "the backgrounds present a major obstacle for observing unpolarized electroweak ( @xmath0 and @xmath39 mediated ) jet production at the fermilab tevatron @xmath40 collider and the cern large hadron collider @xcite . at the intermediate energy of rhic ,",
    "the background / signal ratio ( 25 - 30 or more ) is comparable to that at the cern @xmath1 super proton synchrotron ( sps ) with the energy @xmath41 gev , where a @xmath42 enhancement from @xmath0 and @xmath39 bosons in the dijet mass ( @xmath18 ) distribution was observed @xcite with very low integrated luminosity ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we argue that the main backgrounds can potentially be controlled at rhic because of their smooth ( non - resonant ) kinematical dependence and symmetry with respect to spatial reflections . due to the smooth behavior",
    ", side - band subtraction can be used to advantage to estimate the _",
    "unpolarized _ background accurately in the @xmath0 signal region by extrapolation from the side bands of the @xmath18 distribution .",
    "the parity symmetry of the dominant background leads to its cancellation in the single - spin cross section , up to a small false asymmetry due to the uncertainty in the proton beam polarization .",
    "thus the parity - violating @xmath31 preserves the clear pattern of pdf flavor dependence typical of @xmath0 boson production and allows us access to @xmath25 and to @xmath27 in well - defined kinematic regions .",
    "it is not possible to distinguish @xmath8 and @xmath11 contributions in the jet pair decay mode .",
    "this apparent limitation does not disfavor the hadron decay mode with respect to the leptonic decay mode in situations in which charged lepton identification is not available , such as at the earlier stages of rhic spin program .",
    "full separation of the @xmath0 and @xmath39 signals is not possible as a consequence of limited jet invariant mass resolution ( of order 5 - 10 gev ) .",
    "however , the @xmath39 contribution , with its relatively small event rate , has only mild effect on the pdf dependence of jet pair cross sections",
