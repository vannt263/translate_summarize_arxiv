    "semiclassical physics gives us the entropy and hawking radiation rates of black holes .",
    "in string theory we can understand extremal and near - extremal holes in terms of branes , and thereby reproduce the entropy and radiation from a microscopic description .    in this paper we will consider another property of black holes that can be described in classical general relativity : the transition between black holes and black strings when a transverse circle is made large or small .",
    "we suggest a simple microscopic picture of this transition , which will reproduce many of the broad features of the ` phase diagram ' of the system .      in fig.[fig :",
    "bh - bs_pt](a ) we depict a small black hole in a spacetime with a compact transverse direction which we will call @xmath4 ; the length of this transverse circle is @xmath5 . in fig.[fig : bh - bs_pt](b ) we depict a hole with a larger mass ; the horizon now feels a significant distortion from the compactification . in fig.[fig : bh - bs_pt](c ) we have increased the mass still further ; the black hole horizon has now turned into a ` black string ' horizon .",
    "( b ) the horizon distorts when the mass is increased so that its radius becomes comparable to @xmath5 ( c ) at still larger masses we get a black string which wraps uniformly around the compact circle.,width=480 ]    ( a)(b)(c )    the black string has a nonzero ` tension ' @xmath6 along the compact circle . the hole in fig.[fig : bh - bs_pt](b )",
    "will also have some tension in this direction .",
    "when we take the hole to be very small , as in fig.[fig : bh - bs_pt](a ) , the hole does not notice the compactification , and this tension becomes small too , vanishing for infinitesimal holes .",
    "the relevant parameter here is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radius of the horizon .",
    "when this parameter is small the effects of the compactification go away , and the tension becomes ignorable in the determination of the geometry of the hole .    through a large number of studies , some analytical and some numerical , an interesting ` phase diagram ' has emerged for this system @xcite-@xcite . in fig.[fig : nvsmu_gravity](a ) we reproduce this diagram for the case of 5-d ; i.e. 4 noncompact space dimensions and the compact circle of length @xmath5 . in fig.[fig :",
    "nvsmu_gravity](b ) we give the diagram for 4-d ; i.e. , 3 noncompact space directions and the compact circle .",
    "( our interest will be in the 4-d case , but we give the diagram for the 5-d case as well since it is more complete  numerical computations are easier in this case since the gravitational fields fall off faster at infinity . )",
    "+    ( a)(b )    on the horizontal axis we have the mass , scaled by some constant and termed @xmath9 . on the vertical axis",
    "we have a dimensionless tension @xmath10 . for small @xmath9",
    "we have just the ` black hole ' phase , with @xmath11 for @xmath12 . at very large @xmath9",
    "we have the ` black string ' phase , with @xmath13 independent of @xmath9 .",
    "but the most striking feature of these phase diagrams is that we do not see just a black hole and a black string ; for a range of @xmath9 there is a third branch , called the ` non - uniform black string ' .    in each of these phases",
    "we can compute the bekenstein entropy from the area of the horizon . in fig.[fig : svsmu_gravity](a),(b ) we reproduce the entropy graphs .",
    "the horizontal axis again gives the mass , and on the vertical axis we plot @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the entropy of the uniform string .",
    "thus the uniform string branch just gives a horizontal line at height unity .",
    "the black hole branch is seen to have higher entropy at low mass , and lower entropy at high mass .",

    "the microscopic picture works best for extremal and near - extremal objects .",
    "this is because supersymmetry prevents strong dependences on coupling and thus allows computations in terms of weakly interacting excitations .",
    "so our first goal is to map the phase diagram of neutral objects to the phase diagram for near - extremal objects .",
    "a detailed study of this map was made in @xcite , and we will use many of their results .",
    "we will work in type iib string theory .",
    "consider the compactification m_9,1m_4,1t^4s^1 the compact circle of length @xmath5 will be chosen from the spatial directions in @xmath16 , we will call it @xmath17",
    ".    we will add large d1 and d5 charges to the neutral object .",
    "the addition of charges is done by ` boosting ' the system in the compact direction @xmath18 ; this gives a momentum charge p in that direction .",
    "dualities convert this to a d1 charge along @xmath18 .",
    "we boost again along @xmath18 , and dualize to get a d5 charge on @xmath19 .",
    "first let @xmath20 , so we have a black object in 4 + 1 noncompact spacetime dimensions .",
    "this is the near extremal d1-d5 black hole studied in @xcite . in the microscopic description ,",
    "the d1-d5 bound state produces an ` effective string ' winding along @xmath18 with total winding number @xmath21 .",
    "the non - extremal energy of the system is carried by a dilute gas of @xmath22 excitations along the @xmath18 direction , running along this effective string .",
    "the entropy of these excitations is given by s=2(+ ) [ en1 ] with no net @xmath23 charge , we have @xmath24 , and the value of @xmath25 is given by the non - extremal energy .",
    "so we have a microscopic picture of ` small black holes ' , i.e. black holes where @xmath7 is small .",
    "now let us imagine that @xmath5 is small .",
    "then the effective compactification is m_9,1m_3,1t^4s^1s^1 [ com2 ] with this compactification we can make an extremal black hole with 4 kinds of charges : d1 , d5 as above , p along @xmath18 , and kk monopoles which have @xmath17 as their nontrivially fibered circle .",
    "what we have however is two nonzero charges ( d1 , d5 ) plus nonextremal energy .",
    "note that the 4 kinds of charges can be permuted in all possible ways by dualities .",
    "using this fact , we can write the entropy of this near - extremal system from the expression found in @xcite , getting s=2(+)(+ ) [ en2 ] if the net p , kk charges are zero then @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and the values of @xmath27 are determined by extremising @xmath28 over all possibilities for given total nonextremal energy .",
    "this entropy describes a black object that is uniformly smeared in all the compact directions of ( [ com2 ] ) , so it is a ` uniform black string ' in the direction @xmath17 .",
    "one can write an expression similar to ( [ en1]),([en2 ] ) for the neutral hole as well @xcite .",
    "but we have chosen to add charges to our system and look at the near - extremal systems ( [ en1]),([en2 ] ) because for these cases we also have a microscopic derivation of low energy hawking radiation @xcite . thus not only is the count of states correct , their microscopic description must also be correct because they lead to the expected dynamics .",
    "let us return to our problem of interest . for large @xmath5 , we have the ` black hole phase ' , described by ( [ en1 ] ) , and for small @xmath5 we have the ` uniform black string ' phase , described by ( [ en2 ] ) .",
    "what happens when we reduce @xmath5 from large values to small values ?",
    "we seek a microscopic picture of the intermediate @xmath5 regime , which will help us understand the three phases that emerge in the gravity computation ; in particular we wish to understand the ` non - uniform black string ' in the microscopic picture .",
    "we proceed in the following steps :    \\(a ) a basic property of gravity solutions with a horizon is the smarr relation .",
    "this is a scaling relation that relates the tension @xmath6 of the solution to the mass , charge and entropy .",
    "since our microscopic model must describe a black object with a horizon , the smarr relation must be satisfied by the model .",
    "we thus recall the smarr relation and sketch its derivation .",
    "\\(b ) the gravity solution has a nontrivial metric in @xmath16 .",
    "the compact directions @xmath19 can be ` added on trivially ' to the neutral solution in @xmath16 ; i.e. the metric is flat and constant in these directions . from einstein s equations",
    "one then finds that the tension in these ` trivial ' directions must be _ nonzero _ in general .",
    "thus from a microscopic perspective , these directions are not so ` trivial ' : one must wrap branes around these directions to obtain the required tension .",
    "the tension in these ` trivial ' directions is also important in getting the correct changes of physical parameters under the ` boosting ' which adds charge .",
    "we recall the equations that relate old and new quantities upon boosting ; these were derived in @xcite , but we also supply a physical derivation valid at weak gravitational coupling since this makes some of the physics more transparent .",
    "\\(c ) we next make a microscopic model that describes the transition from the black hole to the black string .",
    "the entropy ( [ en1 ] ) arises from momentum modes @xmath29 that are fractionated in units of @xmath30 by the presence of the d1 , d5 branes @xcite .",
    "the entropy ( [ en2 ] ) comes from two kinds of excitations ( momentum and kk monopoles ) which are again fractionated by the d1 , d5 brane charges @xcite .",
    "we make a simple model where a part @xmath31 of the nonextremal energy @xmath32 goes to creating entropy of the type ( [ en1 ] ) and the rest @xmath33 goes to creating entropy of type ( [ en2 ] ) . in this process",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath34 of the ` fractionating charge ' @xmath21 goes to fractionating the excitations used in ( [ en1 ] ) , and the fraction @xmath35 goes to fractionating the excitations for ( [ en2 ] ) .",
    "we then extremise over @xmath36 to find the preferred state of the microscopic system .",
    "we find that below some energy @xmath32 there is just one phase , the ` black hole ' phase , where all entropy is of type ( [ en1 ] ) .",
    "but for @xmath31 greater than a certain critical value , there are three extrema of the entropy .",
    "one is a ` black hole ' with entropy entirely of type ( [ en1 ] ) , one is a ` uniform black string ' which has entropy entirely of type ( [ en2 ] ) , and a third exremum where the entropy is partly of type ( [ en1 ] ) and partly of type ( [ en2 ] ) .",
    "this last extremum is a saddle point of the entropy , and we identify it with the non - uniform black string .",
    "the tension and entropy graphs for this very simple microscopic model are given in section [ microsection ] , in fig.[fig:4dnvsmu_micro ] and fig.[fig:4dsvsmu_micro ] respectively .",
    "\\(d ) while this simple model reproduces the three phases seen in the gravity computations , we notice one simple qualitative difference between the microscopic and gravity computations : the microscopic model has a vanishing tension in the black hole phase , while the gravity description gives a tension that rises from zero as the mass is increased from zero .",
    "we argue that this tension should be found in the microscopic picture if we include the ` twist operator interaction ' in the microscopic cft , something we have not done in our leading order computation .",
    "an indirect approach to computing the tension of the black hole branch was taken in @xcite , and we extend this approach here .",
    "one computes the tension from the gravity description , and uses this to read off the changes in excitations in the microscopic description . in the microscopic description",
    "we can imagine integrating out the effects of the kk monopole pairs ( which are only weakly excited at large @xmath5 ) to obtain an ` effective interaction ' between the @xmath22 excitations of the black hole .",
    "we first use the leading order gravity result to find this interaction to leading order in the microscopic picture",
    ". then we use analyticity in the microscopic variables to predict the tension to next order on the gravity side , and observe agreement with the known gravity computation at that order .",
    "we thus obtain some understanding of tension in the black hole phase .",
    "we note some agreements and also some disagreements between the gravity phase diagram and the microscopic diagram .",
    "we hope to return in future work to exploring further the interactions in the microscopic picture in order to obtain a more accurate phase diagram .",
    "we recall the smarr relation @xcite , and sketch a derivation ; derivations along these lines can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "the full theory of quantum gravity has an inbuilt length scale  the planck length @xmath37 .",
    "but @xmath37 involves @xmath38 , and the classical theory does not have this length scale .",
    "the action @xmath39 does not have any natural length scale , so if we have one solution to the vacuum equations , we can obtain another by uniformly scaling up all lengths by the same factor .",
    "let the length of the compact direction @xmath4 change as l   l+dl [ zero ] consider a black hole in a spacetime with one compact direction @xmath4 of length @xmath5 .",
    "let the number of noncompact spacetime dimensions be @xmath40 ; thus including the compact circle @xmath4 the total spacetime dimension is @xmath41 . in this dimension the mass @xmath42 scales as @xmath43 .",
    "( the mass appears in the metric through the combination @xmath44 , which has units @xmath43 ; @xmath45 is held fixed , and thus @xmath42 scales as @xmath43 . ) thus we will get m  m(1+dll)^d-2 ,  dm = m(d-2)dll [ one ] the entropy is proportional to the surface area of the horizon .",
    "the horizon is a @xmath46 dimensional surface , so it will scale as s  s(1+dll)^d-1 ,  ds = s(d-1)dll [ two ] the charge @xmath47 appears in the metric the same way that the mass does , so we have q  q(1+dll)^d-2 ,  dq = q(d-2)dll [ three ]    now assume that the solution satisfies the first law of thermodynamics ( this will be true for all black objects ) de = tds+t dl+ dq where @xmath6 is the ` tension ' in the @xmath4 direction and @xmath48 the potential at the horizon . this law will be satisfied in particular for the changes ( [ zero])-([three ] ) , since these changes lead from one valid solution to another .",
    "we thus get e(d-2)=ts(d-1)+t l+q(d-2 ) or ts=(d-2)(e - q)-t ld -1 [ smarrnewp ] this is the smarr relation .",
    "consider the metric of a black object , by which we mean any solution of gravity with a single connected horizon .",
    "we assume that the solution is neutral , i.e. it carries no charge .",
    "the metric is of the form ds^2=-udt^2+ds_b^2 [ original ] where @xmath49 is independent of @xmath50 and the `` base metric '' @xmath51 involves only the spatial coordinates .",
    "the horizon is at the location @xmath52 .",
    "we can add one or more ` trivial directions ' to this metric ; we single out a special one called @xmath53 for later use : ds^2=-udt^2+ds_b^2+dy^2+dz_adz_a [ neutral ] we will think of the added directions as compact circles . in particular let @xmath54 .",
    "we can start with the solution ( [ neutral ] ) and add charges to it by boosting plus dualities . thus writing t",
    "= t+y ,  y = t+ y[boost ] we get ds^2=h^-1[-udt^2+h^2 ( dy-a_t dt)^2]+ds_b^2+dz_adz_a [ charged ] where h=1+(1-u ) ^2 ,  a_t=(h^-1 - 1 )    this process adds ` momentum charge @xmath55 ' . we can change this to a different kind of charge by s , t dualities , and add further charges by boosting .",
    "we will write down a 2-charge solution in the appendix , but for now we will look at the simple case having just @xmath55 charge .",
    "we can extract the following properties of the boosted solution ; the derivations can be seen from the 2-charge case discussed in the appendix .",
    "let the neutral solution ( [ neutral ] ) have mass @xmath42 , entropy @xmath28 , and temperature @xmath56 .",
    "( the temperature is extracted from the surface gravity at the horizon in the usual way . )",
    "the part @xmath51 describes a @xmath57 dimensional noncompact space and a compact direction @xmath4 , and we will let @xmath6 denote the tension in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "what are the properties of the charged solution ( [ charged ] ) ?",
    "note that @xmath53 was a compact direction , and we do not have the boost symmetry ( [ boost ] ) for compact @xmath53 .",
    "but since the classical solution is homogeneous in @xmath53 , we can lift the solution to the covering space of @xmath53 , apply the boost , and then ` recompactify ' the new coordinate @xmath58 . since the boosted solution is again homogeneous in @xmath58 , we can pick any coordinate length to compactify @xmath58 .",
    "let us choose @xmath59 , thus keeping the length of the compact circle the same as in the neutral solution .",
    "then we find the following @xcite :    \\(a ) the mass @xmath60 of the charged solution ( [ charged ] ) is given by m=m(1+d-2-nd-1 ^2 ) [ massgr ] where the relative tension @xmath13 is defined as n [ relative ]    \\(b ) the tension @xmath61 of the charged solution is the same as that of the neutral solution =t [ tensiongr ]    \\(c ) the charge of the solution is q = m d-2-nd-1 [ chargegr ]    \\(d ) the entropy @xmath62 of the charged solution is s=s [ entropygr ]    \\(e ) the temperature @xmath63 of the charged solution is t=tc note that ts=ts    \\(f ) the electric potential at the horizon is =      the above relations ( a)-(f ) between the neutral and charged solutions are straightforward to derive in the gravity description of black objects .",
    "but our goal is to understand black objects from a microscopic point of view . from this ` matter ' point of view these relations appear somewhat nontrivial .",
    "they tell us the thermodynamic properties of a charged system once we know the properties of the neutral system . but abstractly speaking , there is no general relation between charged and neutral systems .",
    "so we must be looking at very special systems , and our microscopic model must be made to reproduce the properties of such special systems . to understand these properties better , we now rederive the relations of the above section from a microscopic perspective .      consider the neutral system .",
    "let the total spacetime dimension be @xmath64 .",
    "the einstein equations are r_ab-12 g_ab r=8 g t_ab we can rewrite these as r_ab=8gt_ab where t_ab = t_ab-1d-2 g_ab t we will now assume that the gravitational field is weak .",
    "this will not be the case in general for the systems we finally consider , but we are only trying to get a physical feeling for the relations ( a)-(f ) which are already known to be correct , and this weak - field assumption will allow us to extract some basic ideas in a simple way . writing @xmath65 we get ( in the gauge @xmath66 ) -12h_ab-12 h_,ab=8gt_ab [ final ]    recall that we had started with a metric of the form ( [ original ] ) and added ` trivial ' directions to obtain the metric ( [ neutral ] ) .",
    "it seems from the gravity point of view that these extra directions play no role in the physics of the black object .",
    "but from a microscopic viewpoint we see a different story .",
    "let the weak gravity system ( [ final ] ) describe this situation where we have trivially added directions @xmath67 , and the metric is nontrivial in the noncompact directions @xmath68 and the compact direction @xmath4 .",
    "consider one of the ` trivial ' directions , say @xmath53 .",
    "first , we have _ homogeneity _ in @xmath53 , so fields do not depend on @xmath53 .",
    "thus in ( [ final ] ) we will get @xmath69 .",
    "second , we have _ uniformity _ of the @xmath53 circle , which means that the size of this circle does not change from place to place .",
    "this gives @xmath70 .",
    "( [ final ] ) then gives @xmath71 , which is t_yy-1d-2 t = t_yy-1d-2[-t_00+t_zz+t_yy+t_z_az_a]=0 [ basic ] note that @xmath72 in general , so @xmath73 in general .",
    "this means that our microscopic model _ can not _ consist of branes that extend only in the directions @xmath74 while ignoring the trivial directions @xmath67 .",
    "branes have a tension only along their worldvolumes , and such a model would give @xmath75 .",
    "instead , we must have at least one kind of brane wrapping each of the ` trivial ' directions .",
    "as an example consider the schwarzschild solution in 4 + 1 noncompact dimensions .",
    "we can add the other 5 directions of string theory as ` trivial directions ' in the gravity solution .",
    "but a microscopic model for this system can be written in terms of branes and antibranes of type d1 , d5 , p @xcite , and these objects are seen to wrap around the 5 ` trivial ' directions .",
    "the mass of the neutral system is m= t_00 the tension @xmath6 along the @xmath4 direction is = - t_zzl first note that under the boost ( [ boost ] ) we have @xmath76 , so the tension remains unchanged =t which is the relation ( [ tensiongr ] ) .",
    "next , note that m= t_00= ( t_00 ^ 2+t_yy ^2 ) [ mass ] in ( [ basic ] ) the ` trivial ' directions @xmath67 are all on the same footing , so @xmath77 .",
    "we then find t_yy=-1d-1(t_00-t_zz ) [ tyy ] substituting this in ( [ mass ] ) we find m=m ^2 - 1d-1(m+t l)^2=m+m d-2 -nd-1 ^2[massnew ] where we have used the definition @xmath78 .",
    "thus we reproduce ( [ massgr ] ) .",
    "the charge @xmath55 is q= t_0y= ( t_00 + t_yy ) using ( [ tyy ] ) we find q=(d-2)m -t ld-1 = m d-2 -nd-1 [ chargenew ] which agrees with ( [ chargegr ] ) .      now consider the entropy @xmath28 .",
    "the neutral system was homogeneous in the direction @xmath53 ; we used this fact in lifting to the noncompact covering space before boosting .",
    "the classical entropy is linear in the coordinate length of the @xmath53 circle , since the area of the horizon is proportional to this length .",
    "thus the entropy of the microscopic model must be extensive in the length @xmath79 .",
    "under boosting along @xmath53 we would expect that the length of the @xmath53 direction would contract by a factor @xmath80 ; thus it would fit in a length @xmath81 .",
    "we could have chosen any length of recompactification after boosting , but our choice was to keep @xmath79 unchanged .",
    "this means that we have considered a ` larger amount of matter ' in the charged case ",
    "larger by a factor @xmath82 .",
    "this accounts for the relation s=s [ entropynew ]      the potential of the charged system is defined as = ( mq)_s setting @xmath84 in ( [ entropynew ] ) we find s d+dsdmdm=0 [ alpha ] then from ( [ massnew ] ) we find ( using ( [ alpha ] ) to eliminate @xmath85 ) dm=dmfrom ( [ chargenew ] ) we find dq = dmas it stands , the ration @xmath86 does not simplify .",

    "the string excitations represent both @xmath178 pairs and @xmath181 pairs .",

    "this suggests that we will need to partition the d5 branes into two sets : a fraction @xmath34 which will contribute to the first mode and a fraction @xmath35 which will contribute to the second mode .",
    "now return to our actual problem , where the compactification is @xmath182 and instead of the d5 charge we have d1-d5 charge .",

    "we expect that in the phase transition we will need to partition the product @xmath21 into two parts : a fraction @xmath34 for the first mode and a fraction @xmath35 for the second mode .",

    "we can thus assume that we are looking at a situation with three nonzero charges in 3 + 1 noncompact dimensions , with a small amount of nonextremality .",
    "since the 4 possible charges for this compactification can be freely permuted by dualities , we can equally well look at a system where the nonzero charges are d1,d5,kk , and the nonextremality then creates pairs of fractional @xmath178 excitations .",

    "the rescaled tension is defined as r = le = le(el)_s , q_i where @xmath32 is the energy above extremality ( so that the total energy is given by @xmath194 ) . consider the entropy given by ( [ smax ] ) . since @xmath195 , we find that @xmath28 is kept constant if the variations of @xmath196 satisfy e= 2 e ll thus r= le2 el=2 [ forpq ] this agrees with the result from the gravity computation when we have the extremal three large charges limit . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in this limit the @xmath152 vs. @xmath121 graphs for the three phases in the gravity computation all degenerate and the charges are given by m&=&m(1 + 2-n3(^2_1+^2_5+^2_p ) ) + q_i & = & m 2-n3 _ i_i , i=1,5,p taking all the charges to be large ( @xmath197 ) one finds m=q_1+q_5+q_p+m n2 e = m n2 since the absolute tension of the neutral system is the same of the one of the 3-charge system , the rescaled tension is r = me n = 2 ] to the line @xmath198 .",
    "thus , as far as the tension is concerned , model a gives a prediction which is consistent with gravity .    but",
    "this analysis may also look a little puzzling , for the following reason . in the gravity computation the three phases collapse to one horizontal line in the @xmath199 diagram , but there should still be three overlapping phases for each @xmath121 in the range where the non - uniform string exists .",
    "on the other hand the analysis of model a gives a unique maximum for the entropy for all @xmath121 , so there seems to be only one phase .    to emphasize the puzzle",
    "still further consider the model ( [ sxx ] ) that we have analyzed in the case of two large charges d1 , d5 , and where we did get three phases for a range of @xmath121 . in this model",
    "we can let @xmath200 , thus getting a nonzero p charge .",
    "all the results derived above for this model can be extended to the nonzero @xmath23 case by changing @xmath29 in the following way to account for the p charge : n_pn_p e^,|n_p |n_p e^- [ pmap ] the limit of large p is given by taking @xmath201 .",
    "let us denote the microscopic model obtained in this way as model b. from the point of view of model b , it is clear that there is a one to one map between the phase diagram we have found at @xmath202 and the one at @xmath203 , given by ( [ pmap ] ) . in particular model b still predicts three phases ( which all degenerate to the line @xmath198 as @xmath204 ) .    we thus need to ask : if we go slightly off extremality , how does the single line in the tension graph of model a split into three closely spaced lines ?",
    "we expect that we will see this split if we take into account interactions in the cft which describes the near extremal 3-charge system .",
    "this is a general feature of adding charges to a system ; we simplify the system by going closer to extremality , but we may need to take into account interactions between the degrees of freedom of the system to recover all the physics .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail in the next section when we talk about the need for interactions to understand the tension in the black hole phase .",
    "our microscopic model gives a phase diagram that has several features of the phase diagram obtained by numerically solving the equations of general relativity .",
    "but one important feature that is missing is the tension of the black hole branch : the microscopic model gives @xmath205 while the numerical results show a tension rising from zero as the mass is increased .",
    "this tension was recently related to microscopics in @xcite . in this section",
    "we discuss why this tension did not show up in our calculation of the last section , and extract some properties of the tension from microscopic arguments .",
    "we first recall the origin of this tension in the gravity picture .",
    "a similar calculation can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "( a)(b )    fig.[fig : squeezedbh](a ) shows a black hole with radius much smaller than the compactification length . in fig.[fig : squeezedbh](b ) we lift to the covering space , getting an infinite set of images of the black hole .",
    "each copy of the hole feels the attraction of all other copies , and this creates a negative potential energy which is the effect of the compactification . at leading",
    "order we can just use the newtonian potential to compute this energy . in 4 + 1",
    "dimensions the gravitational potential energy between two bodies of mass @xmath206 at distance @xmath152 is v=-4 g^(5)_n3m_1m_2r^2 the energy between a hole and all its images is v_array=-43g_n^(5)m^2l^22 _",
    "n=1 ^ 1n^2=-49g_n^(5)m^2l^2 where we have used that _",
    "n=1^=^26 the part of this energy that we must attribute to the compactification length @xmath5 is v_int = v_array2= -29g_n^(5 ) m^2l^2 [ vint ] the tension is given by @xmath207 . since the black hole horizon is not distorted to leading order , the entropy is independent of @xmath5 , and we can just compute the @xmath5 derivative of @xmath208 to obtain lt [ tension ] where the approximation symbol denotes the fact that we have just computed the interaction energy at leading order in the size of the black hole .",
    "the above calculation was for neutral holes , but we can obtain @xmath208 for charged holes by relating them to neutral holes via the relations of section [ boostsec ] . we need large d1,d5 charges , and finite p charge .",
    "let @xmath209 be the energy above extremality in the absence of the interaction @xmath208 . with no interaction the tension @xmath13 vanishes , so that at leading order one has e_0 2_p [ e0 ] the tension is invariant under the addition of charges ( eq .",

    "we can write for the charged hole = ( el)_q , s = v_intl note that the entropy changes in a known way under addition of charge by boosting ( @xmath210 ) . from this relation and ( [ p0 ] ) we see that ( to the order we are working at ) we keep @xmath211 fixed if we keep @xmath212 fixed .",
    "thus the tension is related to @xmath208 only through variations of @xmath5 , and we find for the charged case a relation analogous to ( [ vint ] ) v_int-2(e_02_p)^2 [ vintcharged ]      let us now ask how the energy ( [ vintcharged ] ) would be obtained in a field theory calculation .",
    "we have seen that this energy is obtained from the long range gravitational attraction between the hole and its images .",
    "the exchanged graviton can be seen in a dual channel as a 1-loop open string diagram , but note that since @xmath213 all modes of the open string contribute in the loop integral , not just the lowest energy modes .",
    "( a)(b )    now let us ask how this interaction would be seen in a dual field theory description .",
    "first look at a simpler system : an open string stretched between two d3-branes , with the length of this string being @xmath214 ; this is pictured in fig.[fig : intrbranes](a ) .",
    "the low energy dynamics of this open string has a tower of closely spaced vibration modes .",
    "now consider such a string , still stretched between two d3 branes , in a space with large d3 brane charge ",
    "i.e. , in @xmath215 . in the gravity picture",
    ", the string still has a tower of oscillation modes .",
    "but in the dual cft the open string is a gauge boson , higgsed because of the separation between the d3 branes at its ends . at weak coupling",
    "this gauge boson has no tower of excitation modes .",
    "but at larger coupling , we can sum a set of ladder diagrams and see that the tower of oscillation modes is reproduced @xcite .",
    "thus we see that the tower of modes in the gravity picture of fig.[fig : intrbranes](a ) is reproduced in the cft by degrees of freedom that arise from only the _ ground _ states of open strings ; the price we pay is that we have to consider all orders of interaction between these open strings .",
    "let us draw lessons from this example for our own system . in the gravity picture fig.[fig :",
    "squeezedbh](b ) we have all modes of the open string stretched between images of the black hole .",
    "the dual cft in our case is complicated , but can be assumed to arise in some way analogous to the field theory of open strings on branes . to see the vibration modes of the open string in the cft we thus expect that we will need to consider all orders of interaction between the basic degrees of freedom of the cft .",
    "but in our microscopic computation of the phase transition we considered only the free cft .",
    "this should explain why we did not see the tension in the black hole phase .",
    "interactions in the cft are difficult to study . in the d1-d5 cft",
    "they involve the insertion of a ` twist ' operator in the orbifold cft @xcite . with the presence of the kk - monopole degrees of freedom",
    ", we will get other interactions as well .",
    "if we do not study these interactions , how can we proceed to study the phase transition ?    in @xcite",
    "a method was developed to get an indirect picture of the cft effects , and this method was used further in @xcite .",
    "we will recall this approach below , and study it a further to extract some properties of the effective interactions in the cft .",
    "first consider the black hole in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "then we have just a black hole carrying d1,d5 charges in 4 + 1 dimensions , and this is described by the 1 + 1 dimensional cft .",
    "the energy above extremality and the p charge are given by e_0 = m_p ( n_p+|n_p),p = n_p-|n_p [ ep ] using ( [ e0 ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) we find n_p = m e^2_p6 m_p,_p = m e^-2_p6 m_p [ npnpbar ]    in @xcite a ` mixed ' approach was taken .",
    "suppose that for @xmath20 the black hole non - extremal energy is @xmath209 and the charge is @xmath23 ; we can find @xmath29 using ( [ ep ] ) . for finite @xmath5",
    "there is a lowering of the energy due to the interaction with images , by an amount @xmath208 .",
    "thus for the same total energy , there will be higher values of @xmath29 , and a correspondingly higher entropy .",
    "this increase in the entropy can be checked against the gravity prediction .",
    "this is a ` mixed ' approach in the sense that @xmath208 is computed from gravity , and then fed into the microscopic computation through the values of @xmath29 .",
    "we will also follow such a mixed approach , but proceed in a slightly different way that will allow us to better extract some quantities of interest . at @xmath20",
    "the near horizon region of the d1-d5 system is dual to a 1 + 1 dimensional cft , in which the left and right movers do not interact ; thus there is no term coupling @xmath25 to @xmath216 .",
    "because the ads region ends and goes over to flat space , there is a breaking of conformal symmetry and a coupling of left and right movers to the graviton field ; this cubic interaction was responsible for hawking emission from the near - extremal d1-d5 system @xcite . in the present problem",
    "we will let the charge radii of the d1,d5 charges be much larger than @xmath5 , so this changeover from ads to flat space is not relevant , and the above coupling is not the leading order interaction between left and right movers . but",
    "what we do have is a compact @xmath4 direction , and kk monopole pairs can wrap around this circle .",
    "when we integrate out the effect of these pairs we will be left with an interaction between left and right movers .",
    "we will now try to understand these effective interactions in more detail , obtaining information about them from gravity , the smarr scaling relation , the behavior under boost etc .",
    "we see from ( [ vintcharged ] ) , using ( [ npnpbar ] ) , that the interaction energy can be written as v_int= -8 g_n^(5 ) m_p^2l^2 n_p |n_p",
    "we observe that the interaction energy vanishes in the bps case ( @xmath217 or @xmath218 ) , as expected .",

    "the horizon is not deformed to leading order , so we still have s=2(+ ) [ entropy ]    how do we continue the study of interactions to higher order ? in the @xmath20 limit we had a free cft and we determined @xmath29 from the relations ( [ ep ] ) . in the interacting theory there will be an ambiguity in defining @xmath29 for a given state . from the gravity perspective we can split the corrections to the thermodynamics into two kinds of terms : those that come from nonlinearlities of general relativity and those that arise because the horizon of the black hole is distorted by the compactification .",
    "the latter set of terms do not start till order @xmath219 , where @xmath8 is the horizon radius .",

    "the nontrivial information about the system will then be in the expression for @xmath32 in terms of @xmath29 .",
    "note that a priori we have @xmath221 .",
    "roughly speaking , the smarr scaling relation will set the @xmath5 dependence , and the behavior under boosts will set the @xmath47 dependence .",
    "thus the freedom in @xmath32 will be equivalent to ` one function of one variable ' .",
    "the coefficients describing this remaining function we will take from the gravity calculation  in principle they can all be determined numerically , but of course we will be looking at only the first few coefficients , and these can be understood analytically .",
    "this section is somewhat long , so we first summarize the steps in our computation . in section ( [ gravhole ] )",
    "we recall the relations in gravity between the neutral system and the charged one , but in a notation specially adapted to the study of the black hole branch . in section ( [ defdim ] )",

    "we extend this result to the case where we keep the first order in @xmath225 , but all orders in @xmath226 .",
    "let us recall the relation ( [ erelation ] ) e = ts22_p + tl2 [ erelationq ] since we are working in the phase where we have a small black hole , it will be convenient to use variables that relate directly to the structure of the hole .",

    "note that the first order expansion of @xmath255 in powers of @xmath226 implies @xmath256 , in agreement with our earlier result ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "let us summarize the computations of this paper .",
    "we have noted that gravity computations reveal an interesting phase diagram for the black hole  black string transition , with three phases for a range of @xmath7 .",
    "we can add charges to the neutral system by ` boosting plus dualities ' .",
    "this does not add or lose any information as far as the gravity computation is concerned , since the neutral and boosted variables are related in a simple and invertible way .",
    "but it does map the problem to a near extremal one , where we can look for microscopic models .",
    "for @xmath7 very small we get the near extremal 2-charge system in 4 + 1 noncompact dimensions , and for @xmath7 very large we get the near extremal 2-charge system in 3 + 1 noncompact dimensions . both these systems have been given a microscopic description in earlier work on the subject .",
    "we propose a simple model that interpolates between these two microscopic models ; the nontrivial step is guessing what kind of ` fractionation ' will describe the d1-d5 degrees of freedom in the interpolating regime .",
    "we find that the three - phase nature of the phase diagram is reproduced if we assume that the the two large charges @xmath111 bind to make @xmath257 units of an effective charge , and this product @xmath258 is then partitioned between subsystems that behave like one or the other of the two limiting systems mentioned above .",
    "we suggest a physical reason why this kind of ` fractionation ' is reasonable for this problem .",
    "note that even though the microscopic model looks like a superposition of two subsystems ( eq.([major ] ) ) , we have not just superposed a black hole and a black string ; the fact that the _ product _ @xmath257 partitions between the two subssytems forces the entire state to be a nontrivial bound state of all the excitations .    the non - uniform string appears as a saddle point between two maxima of the entropy ; this accords with the fact that the entropy of this branch is always lower than the entropy of the other two phases , so it is always unstable .",
    "the @xmath259 graph describing the tension of this branch appears to have a profile @xmath260 from the gravity computation ; the microscopic computation also gives the functional behavior @xmath260 .",
    "the microscopic computation based on such a simple model does not give any tension for the black hole branch .",
    "we have argued that this tension will be seen only if we include interactions like the ` twist interaction ' that are present in the cft when we move away from the orbifold point ( where we have a ` free cft ' ) to a point in moduli space that has the couplings appropriate to the actual gravity dual .",
    "we did not look at such interaction terms directly , but instead followed a ` mixed ' approach similar to that in @xcite .",
    "thus we used the knowledge of the leading order tension in the gravity computation to see what effective interactions we obtain in the cft .",
    "we were then able to reproduce the next order term in the tension by using the invariance of the tension under ` boosting ' . since boosting adds charge it changes @xmath29 and the non - extremal energy @xmath32 , and we get a nontrivial condition when we require invariance of the tension @xmath261 .",
    "this next order term in the tension is equivalent to a corresponding correction term in the energy , and this correction is seen to agree with detailed computations of the energy carried out in @xcite .",
    "the essential physics we used was to assume that we have an expansion of the energy in integer powers of @xmath29 to the first few orders ; this suggest that the @xmath29 ( defined through ( [ relations ] ) ) are good definitions of ` quasi - particles ' for the system to this order in the interaction .    while our microscopic model gives some general qualitative agreements with the gravity phase diagram , there are also some differences .",
    "first of course is the issue of tension for the black hole branch mentioned above .",
    "next , consider for example the point where the non - uniform black string branch starts off from the uniform string branch . in the microscopic model",
    "this branch starts at a mass value that is @xmath262 times the value seen in the gravity diagram .",
    "it would also be nice to see in the microscopic model how the black hole branch bends around to join with the non - uniform string branch , and nature of the physics and the joining point .    in principle",
    "all features of the gravity phase diagram are contained in the correct microscopic dual , so we look upon this phase diagram as a large source of data on the interactions of branes that make up black holes and other black objects .",
    "the phase diagram offers us continuous curves that the microscopics must fit ; further , we are probing a domain where the black object is changing character from one type to another , so we learn about aspects of the cft that we do not encounter when looking at just near extremal entropy or low energy hawking radiation .",
    "thus we consider the model proposed here as just a first pass at understanding the microscopics of branes dual to black objects .",
