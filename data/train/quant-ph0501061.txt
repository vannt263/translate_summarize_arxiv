    "in a multiuser transmission line each user should decode the transmitted symbol and leave the carrier for the subsequent user .",
    "what they need is an ideal _ repeater _ , _ i.e. _ a device that for each shot retrieves the message without altering the carrier .",
    "however , symbols are necessarily encoded in states of a physical system and therefore the ultimate bound on the performances as a repeater are posed by quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , a perfect quantum repeater can not be achieved , _",
    "i.e _ quantum information can not be perfectly copied , neither locally @xcite nor at distance @xcite .",
    "any measurement performed to extract information on a quantum state in turn alters the state itself , _",
    "i.e. _ produces a disturbance .    the trade - off between information gain and quantum state disturbance",
    "can be quantified using fidelities .",
    "let us describe a generic scheme for indirect measurement as a quantum operation , _",
    "i.e. _ without referring to any explicit unitary realization",
    ". the operation is described by a set of _ measurement operators @xmath0 _ , with the condition @xmath1 .",
    "the probability - operator measure ( povm ) of the measurement is given by @xmath2 , whereas its action on the input state is expressed as @xmath3 .",
    "this means that , if @xmath4 is the initial quantum state of the system under investigation , the probability distribution of the outcomes is given by @xmath5= \\hbox{tr}[\\varrho\\ : a^\\dag_k a_k]$ ] , whereas the conditional output state , after having detected the outcome @xmath6 , is expressed as @xmath7 , such that the overall quantum state after the measurement is described by the density matrix @xmath8 .",
    "suppose now you have a quantum system prepared in a pure state @xmath9 .",
    "if the outcome @xmath6 is observed at the output of the repeater , then the estimated signal state is given by @xmath10 ( the typical inference rule being @xmath11 with @xmath10 given by the set of eigenstates of the measured observable ) , whereas the conditional state @xmath12 is left for the subsequent user .",
    "the amount of disturbance is quantified by evaluating the overlap of the conditional state @xmath13 to the initial one @xmath9 , whereas the amount of information extracted by the measurement corresponds to the overlap of the inferred state @xmath10 to the initial one .",
    "the corresponding fidelities , for a given input signal @xmath9 , are given by @xmath14 where we have already performed the average over the outcomes .",
    "the relevant quantities to assess the repeater are then given by the average fidelities @xmath15 which are obtained by averaging @xmath16 and @xmath17 over the possible input states , _",
    "i.e. _ over the alphabet @xmath18 of transmittable symbols .",
    "@xmath19 will be referred to as the transmission fidelity and @xmath20 as the estimation fidelity .",
    "let us first consider two extreme cases .",
    "if nothing is done , the signal is preserved and thus @xmath21 . however , at the same time , our estimation has to be random and thus @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the dimension of the hilbert space .",
    "this corresponds to a _ blind",
    "_ quantum repeater @xcite which re - prepares any quantum state received at the input , without gaining any information on it .",
    "the opposite case is when the maximum information is gained on the signal , _",
    "i.e. _ when the optimal estimation strategy for a single copy is adopted @xcite . in this case @xmath24 , but then the signal after this operation can not provide any more information on the initial state and thus @xmath25 . between these two extrema",
    "there are intermediate cases , _",
    "i.e. _ quantum measurements providing only partial information while partially preserving the quantum state of the signal for subsequent users .",
    "these schemes , which correspond to feasible quantum repeaters , may be also viewed as quantum nondemolition measurements @xcite , which have been widely investigated for continuous variable systems , and recently received attention also for qubits @xcite .",
    "the fidelities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not independent on each other . assuming that @xmath18 corresponds to the set of _ all _ possible quantum states , banaszek @xcite has explicitly evaluated the expressions of fidelities in terms of the measurement operators , rewriting eq .",

    "of course , the estimation fidelity is maximized choosing @xmath10 as the eigenvectors of @xmath27 corresponding to the maximum eigenvalues .    using ( [ fidse ] )",
    "it is possible to derive the bound that fidelities should satisfy according to quantum mechanics . for randomly distributed @xmath23-dimensional signals , _",
    "i.e. _ when the alphabet @xmath18 corresponds to the set of _ all _ quantum states for a qudit , the information - disturbance trade - off reads as follows @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for randomly distributed qubits ,",
    "_ i.e. _ assuming a two - dimensional hilbert space , and with the alphabet @xmath18 equal to the whole bloch sphere , the bound ( [ dbound ] ) reduces to @xmath31 from eq .",
