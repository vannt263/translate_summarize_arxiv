    "the phenomenon of macroscopic quantum nucleation in a metastable condensed medium , which is one of possible examples of the macroscopic quantum tunneling phenomena , has attracted a noticeable attention of researchers during recent years @xcite .",
    "the range of the metastable systems in which the macroscopic quantum nucleation is currently investigated is rather wide .",
    "these are from the helium systems involving , in particular , solidification from the overpressurized liquid phase @xcite , various types of sound - induced nucleation @xcite , phase separation of supersaturated @xmath0he-@xmath1he superfluid mixtures @xcite , and cavitation of bubbles at negative pressures @xcite to the collapse of the bose - einstein condensate in a bose gas with attraction @xcite and the formation of a quark matter in the core of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the modern representation on the decay of a metastable condensed medium is associated , first of all , with the nucleation of a seed of the stable phase and with the concept of a critical nucleus sufficient to overcome some potential barrier due to either thermal or quantum fluctuations and then to convert the whole metastable phase into the stable one .",
    "the decay rate due to its exponential behavior as a function of the barrier height depends drastically on the imbalance between the phases . as a rule",
    ", it is believed that the experimentally observable decay rates should be connected with the vicinity of a metastable medium to some instability resulting in the corresponding reduction of a potential barrier which prevents from the formation of a critical nucleus .",
    "in particular , in the case of the homogeneous cavitation of gas bubbles in a liquid such instability can be associated with approaching to the spinodal line for the liquid - vapor phase transition .",
    "the latter is one of the fundamental conclusions in the recent experiments on the quantum cavitation of bubbles in liquid @xmath0he and @xmath1he at negative pressures @xcite .",
    "the next important aspect of the experimental observations is a crossover in the temperature behavior of the attainable cavitation pressure .",
    "this is treated as an evidence for the thermal - quantum crossover in the cavitation kinetics .",
    "unfortunately , so far the quantum decay of a metastable condensed medium close to instability has not received an appropriate attention with the exception of works @xcite in which any relaxation processes in a medium are completely ignored in consideration .",
    "however , nobody can deny an importance of involving relaxation processes especially for the case of quantum liquids due to strong effect of temperature on the relaxation time in quantum media at low temperatures .",
    "here we eliminate the shortages of the previous theory and involve the effect of relaxation processes accompanied by irreversible energy dissipation upon the underbarrier nucleation kinetics .",
    "it is long known that the critical nuclei responsible for the decay of a metastable condensed medium near the spinodal are characterized by the relatively smooth boundaries and more extended sizes compared with the case of nucleation near the binodal corresponding to thermodynamic equilibrium between the phases .",
    "that is why , the van der waals approach or gradient decomposition is usually employed for the description of fluctuations in a medium .",
    "accordingly , the energy of a reversible fluctuation in a liquid reads as @xcite @xmath2   & = & \\int d^{3}r \\left[\\frac{\\varepsilon ' ' ( \\rho ) } { 2}(\\delta\\rho ) ^2 + \\frac{\\varepsilon ' ' ' ( \\rho ) } { 6}(\\delta\\rho ) ^3\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left .",

    "the second derivative of the energy per unit volume of a liquid can be expressed via either compressibility @xmath6 or sound velocity @xmath7 @xmath8    the spinodal , associated with the violation of thermodynamic inequality @xmath9 and absolute instability against longwave fluctuations @xcite , is determined by vanishing the sound velocity , i.e. , @xmath10 the parameter @xmath11 , depending in general on density , determines a scale of the energy of inhomogeneity and can be interpreted in terms of dispersion of the sound spectrum as a function of wave vector . though the energy of inhomogeneity also contributes into the interfacial tension usually measured at the binodal , one should treat this very carefully .",
    "in fact , in this case one may need to involve next orders into the gradient expansion since the thickness of the interface at the binodal does not much exceed several interatomic distances and the change in density across it is noticeable with the exception of the immediate vicinity of the liquid - vapor critical point .    involving condition",
    ", we can represent the potential energy of a density fluctuation as @xmath12 & = & \\int d^{3}r \\left[\\frac{c_0 ^ 2(\\rho ) } { 2\\rho } \\left ( \\delta\\rho ^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\delta\\rho ^3}{\\rho -\\rho _ c } \\right)\\right .",

    "this estimate is based mainly on extrapolating the sound velocity data from the range of positive pressures to negative ones @xcite .",
    "an explanation of such wholly satisfactory extrapolation beyond the close vicinity of the spinodal point can be found , e.g. , in @xcite . to describe the latter behavior which is more typical for the vicinity of the liquid - vapor critical point",
    ", we must retain the terms of expansion to fourth order in @xmath18 .",
    "though this case requires a special treatment , we believe that the qualitative picture of nucleation remains faithful with the exception of numerical coefficients in the final expressions .",
    "provided we are interested only in thermal fluctuations , eq .   or eq .   is , in principle , sufficient to determine the decay rate within the exponential accuracy since the nucleation process is mainly governed by the saddle point of the functional of potential energy . in order to investigate the underbarrier nucleation kinetics and to calculate the rate of quantum decay",
    ", we employ the formalism in terms of imaginary - time path integrals and based on the use of the finite - action solutions ( instantons ) of equations of motion continued to the imaginary time . for review ,",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this approach of the effective euclidean action was used for describing quantum decay of a metastable condensed medium near the binodal in order to incorporate the energy dissipation effect on the quantum kinetics of first - order phase transitions at low temperatures @xcite .    any fluctuation as a perturbation violates the thermodynamic equilibrium in the liquid , triggering the internal processes to recover the equilibrium .",
    "small oscillations of the density represent a superposition of sound waves .",
    "the character of sound processes depends strongly on a ratio between the typical inverse frequency of density fluctuations and the typical time of relaxation processes in a liquid .",
    "the finiteness of the relaxation times results , in particular , in the frequency dispersion of the sound velocity and in the sound attenuation . obviously , this effect is important for quantum liquids in which the relaxation times depend significantly on temperature .    in general",
    ", deriving the exact equation of sound dispersion for the whole range of frequencies is practically unsolvable problem .",
    "usually , in order to describe the experimental observations , the so - called @xmath19-approximation of a single relaxation time is employed .",
    "then , the dispersion equation , i.e. , relation between wave vector @xmath20 and frequency @xmath21 , reads , e.g. , @xcite @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a relaxation time depending , in general , on temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the low frequency @xmath25 limit corresponds fully to the usual hydrodynamic sound with attenuation coefficient @xmath26 which can be expressed in terms of viscosity @xmath27 .",
    "the sound velocity @xmath28 stands for the velocity of high frequency @xmath29 collisionless sound with the attenuation coefficient proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "in liquid @xmath0he the high frequency limit can be associated with the zero - sound mode and eq .",
    "approximates well both the frequency dispersion of sound velocity and the attenuation within the accuracy of several percent .",
    "let us return to the underbarrier nucleation . the probability of the quantum decay will be proportional to @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the effective euclidean action taken for the optimum path from the entrance point under the potential barrier to the point at which the optimum fluctuation escapes from the barrier .",
    "so , for calculating quantum probability , we must construct the effective action determined in the imaginary time so that the energy of a fluctuation would play a role of a potential energy .",
    "in addition , in accordance with the principle of analytic continuation into the real time the extremum path obtained by varying the effective action and analytically continued from the imaginary matsubara frequencies to real ones ( @xmath33 ) should reproduce the classical equation of motion , i.e. , dispersion eq . which the dynamics of small density fluctuations obeys in the real time .",
    "due to small variations of the density for fluctuations near the spinodal we can describe the motion of a liquid with the aid of the field of displacement @xmath34 .",
    "in other words , we will treat the liquid phase as an elastic medium with zero shear modulus .",
    "a relative variation of the density is related to the change of the bulk element due to deformation @xmath35 the bulk elements after and before deformation are connected with the jacobian according to @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath34 is the displacement vector describing the deformation of a medium .    emphasize that we should employ the relation between density variation @xmath18 and displacement @xmath34 beyond the linear approximation since cubic terms in @xmath18 are involved into the expansion of the energy of a fluctuation .",

    "the spatial behavior of critical fluctuation @xmath68 is shown in fig .  1 .",

    "there is a crossover to the overdamped type at @xmath193 and at @xmath194 , if @xmath195 , the nucleation process becomes a low - frequency collisional one .",
    "compared with the zero temperature value the effective action increases with the temperature as @xmath196 due to enhancement of the collision frequency @xmath197 .",
    "correspondingly , the nucleation rate decreases .",
    "the relative effect at the thermal - quantum crossover temperature when the nucleation rate is minimal is most prominent if @xmath195 .",
    "the case when @xmath198 is meagre . here ,",
    "since always @xmath199 , in the quantum regime we can have only the high - frequency collisionless regime with the next crossover to the thermal arrhenius nucleation .",
    "the temperature behavior of the effective action and nucleation rate demonstrates the same features as in the above - considered case @xmath200 though not so well - marked .",
    "concerning the numerical estimate of parameter @xmath190 , one should evaluate , first of all , parameter @xmath11 related closely with the spatial dispersion of sound in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "thus we need in the reliable estimate of @xmath11 near the spinodal point . as a rule ,",
    "the spatial dispersion , associated with the interatomic spacing @xmath201 , becomes significant at wave vectors close to @xmath202 . to estimate the order of the magnitude for @xmath11 ,",
    "we put that nonlinear term in the sound dispersion due to @xmath203 becomes comparable with the main linear term at @xmath202 . since we suppose that @xmath11 remains finite at the spinodal , it is convenient to represent @xmath204 entailing @xmath205 .",
    "involving that the fermi momentum is also about @xmath206 and @xmath157 is comparable with the fermi velocity , we arrive at the dimensional estimate for parameter @xmath190 @xmath207 so , in liquid @xmath0he one may expect that @xmath208 , entailing a noticeable minimum in the temperature behavior of the nucleation rate in thermal - quantum crossover region .",
    "provided the nucleation rate keeps constant in experiment , this means that attainable deviation @xmath209 and , correspondingly , negative cavitation pressure @xmath210 pass through a minimum in the course of the crossover from the thermal - to - quantum regime with the next almost temperature - independent behavior at sufficiently lower temperatures .",
    "the similar temperature behavior of the supersaturation due to the effect of relaxation processes on the quantum nucleation is observed in supersaturated @xmath0he-@xmath1he liquid mixtures @xcite .",
    "as it concerns the cavitation experiments in @xmath0he @xcite , in this sense the observation of a sharp increase of the cavitation threshold at temperatures below about 60 mk can serve for some evidence of the incipient thermal - quantum crossover .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have suggested a theory which , for the first time , involves the relaxation and high frequency properties of a condensed medium into quantum decay of a metastable liquid near the spinodal at low temperatures .",
    "the model developed can be employed for clarifying the physical picture of the low temperature cavitation in liquid @xmath0he and @xmath1he at negative pressures .",
    "the results obtained might thus be a helpful guide for experiments on the quantum decay in a metastable condensed medium .",
