    "the response provides a direct measure of system dynamics and fluctuations .    in a time - domain response measurement",
    "one uses a series of impulsive perturbations ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and records some property of the system as a function of their time - delays .",
    "impulsive perturbations make it possible to study the free dynamical evolution of the system during the time delays unmasked by the time profile of the perturbing field .",
    "furthermore , the joint dependence on several time delays can be used to separate the contributions of different dynamical pathways . due to its dependence on multiple time delays",
    "this method is termed multidimensional .",
    "the response of a system is typically measured by the expectation value of some operator  @xcite .",
    "this is a linear functional of the system probability density ( or the density matrix for quantum systems ) .",
    "multidimensional response have had considerable success in nonlinear spectroscopy , due to the ability to control and shape optical fields .",

    "interestingly , there exist non - linear functionals of probability densities which have interesting physical interpretations .",

    "a related quantum nonlinear measure called the concurrence serves as a measure of quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the kullback - leibler distance ( kld ) or relative entropy , @xmath1 , which compares one probability distribution to another , is a nonlinear measure that had been found useful in many applications .",
    "this paper aims at developing multidimensional measures based on the kld .",
    "numerous applications of the kld differ in the probability distributions involved .",
    "the ratio of the probability of a stochastic path and its reverse at a steady state has been connected to a change of entropy  @xcite . for an externally driven system a similar quantity was found to be related to the work done on the system  @xcite . as a result , the kld which compares the path distribution to a distribution of reversed paths is a measure of the lack of reversibility of a thermodynamical process .    for distributions in phase - space ( as opposed to path - space ) , the kld between the density of a driven system and the density of a reversed process  @xcite , or the distance between the driven density and the corresponding equilibrium density  @xcite ( for the same value of parameters ) were shown to be bounded by dissipated work in the process .",
    "the transfer of information through a stochastic resonance is quantified by the kld between the probability distributions with and without the external input  @xcite .",
    "the ability of neuronal networks to retain information about past events was characterized by the fisher - information  @xcite , which is closely related to the kld between a distribution and the one obtained from it by a small perturbation .",
    "we shall examine the response of a system to impulsive perturbations which drive it out of a stationary ( steady state or equilibrium ) state .",
    "the kld between the distribution before and after the perturbation does not correspond to an entropy , or work .",
    "however , since it compares the perturbed and unperturbed densities , it characterize how `` easy '' it is to drive the system away from its initial state .",
    "in ordinary response theory , one compared the expectation values of some operator taken over the perturbed and unperturbed probability density .",
    "this depends on the specific properties of the observed operator .",
    "the kld is a more robust measure for the effect of the impulsive perturbation on the probability density . by expanding the kld in the perturbation strength",
    "we obtain a hierarchy of kullback - leibler response functions ( klrf ) .",
    "these differ qualitatively from the hierarchy of ordinary response functions ( orf ) , since they are nonlinear in the probability density .",
    "the klrf serve as a new type of measures characterizing the dynamics and encoding different information than the orf .",
    "for example , the second order klrf , which we connect to the fisher - information , is found to exhibit qualitatively different dependence on the time delays , depending on whether the system is perturbed out of a steady state or out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is in contrast to the corresponding orf .",
    "the fluctuation dissipation relation  @xcite , which is linear in the density matrix , can also distinguish between systems driven out - of - equilibrium and out of a steady state .",
