    "<S> we investigate the energy dependence of hadron production and of stopping power based on hijing / bb v2.0 model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> pseudorapidity spectra and @xmath0 distributions for produced charged particles as well as net baryons ( per pair of partcipants ) and their rapidity loss are compared to data at rhic and predictions for lhc energies are discussed .    in previous papers </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we studied the possible role of topological baryon junctions @xcite @xcite , and the effects of strong color field ( scf ) in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic energies . in the framework of hijing / bb v2.0 model , the new algorithm for junction anti - junction jj loops </S>",
    "<S> provide a possible explanation for baryon / meson anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the scf effects as implemented within our model gives a better description of this anomaly . at lhc energies , due to higher initial energy density ( or temperature ) we expect an increase of the mean value of the string tension ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the day 1 measurements at the lhc will include results on multiplicity distributions with important consequences for our understanding of matter produced in the collisions @xcite,@xcite . from our model calculations </S>",
    "<S> one expects dn@xmath2/d@xmath3 @xmath4 3500 at @xmath5 in central ( 0 - 5 % ) pb + pb collision . </S>",
    "<S> this correspond to @xmath4 17.5 produced charged hadrons per participant pair . </S>",
    "<S> these values are higher than those obtained by requiring that both limiting fragmentation and the trapezoidal shape of the pseudo - rapidity distribution persist at the lhc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts a characteristic violations of the apparently universal trend , seen up to maximum rhic energy . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast saturation models @xcite offer a justification for the predicted very weak @xmath6 dependence of event multiplicity .     </S>",
    "<S> spectra at mid - rapidity of total inclusive charged hadrons for central ( 0 - 5% ) pb+pb and @xmath7 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> right : predicted nuclear modification factors for charged hadrons and for neutral pions.,width=445,height=222 ]    figure [ chpbpb ] presents predictions for @xmath0 spectra at midrapidity and nmf @xmath8 of total inclusive charged hadrons for central ( 0 - 5% ) pb+pb and @xmath7 collisions at @xmath6 = 5.5 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted nmf @xmath9 of neutral pions is also presented . from our model calculations </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that baryon / meson anomaly , will persist at the lhc with a slight increase for increasing strength of the chromoelectric field ( @xmath10 ) . a somewhat higher sensitivity to @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is obtained for nmf of identified particles @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the net - baryon rapidity distribution measured at rhic is both qualitatively and quantitatively very different from those at lower energies indicating that a significantly different system is formed near mid rapidity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ stlhc ] ( left panel ) presents the energy dependence of net - baryon at mid - rapidity per participant pair . </S>",
    "<S> shown are the results for central ( 0 - 5% ) au+au collisions , which indicate a net decrease with increasing energy . </S>",
    "<S> this picture , corroborated with an increase of the ratio @xmath11 to @xmath4 1 suggests that the reaction at the lhc is more transparent in contrast to the situation at lower energy . for central ( 0 - 5% ) pb+pb collisions at @xmath6 = 5.5 tev , our prediction for net - baryon per participant pair is @xmath4 0.065 with @xmath12 = 398 , assuming @xmath1 = 5 gev / fm . </S>",

    "<S> the data and dashed line extrapolation are from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and from brahms @xcite , width=445,height=222 ]    . </S>",
    "<S> [ stlhc ]    in our model the main mechanisms for baryon production are quark di - quark ( @xmath13 ) strings fragmentation and jj loops in which baryons are produced approximatively in pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the energy dependence is @xmath14 similar with those predicted in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> 11 ) with the assumption that jj is a dominant mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is obtained if we choose for the parameters : @xmath15 = 1 gev@xmath16 the usual parameter of regge theory , @xmath17 the reggeon ( @xmath18 ) intercept and @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 ) for the pomeron intercept . </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed , the measurements at lhc energies will help us to determine better these values . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , results from hijing / bb v1.10 model @xcite ( star symbol ) give a slow energy dependence with a higher pomeron intercept @xmath21 and over - estimate the stopping in the entire energy region .    </S>",
    "<S> baryon conservation in the reactions can be used to predict rapidity loss and the energy loss per baryon . </S>",
    "<S> the results are illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the predicted values for rhic and lhc energies , clearly depart from the linear extrapolation for constant relative rapidity loss @xcite , which seems to be valid only at lower energies ( @xmath23 20 gev ) .    </S>",
