    "outflows / jets are commonly observed from black hole systems . they seem to originate from the accreting matter as black hole does not have any intrinsic atmosphere . in rotating accreting matter , centrifugal force at the vicinity of the black hole",
    "acts as a barrier to the faster supersonic matter following it and eventually slows it down .",
    "if the barrier is strong enough then it triggers the formation of shock waves @xcite .",
    "this centrifugally supported post - shock matter is hot and piles up in the form of a torus around the black hole called centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( cenbol ) @xcite . in the post - shock region , accreting matter is compressed and becomes hot .",
    "consequently , excess thermal gradient force develops in the post - shock disc , which ultimately deflects a part of the accreting matter to form bidirectional outflows / jets .",
    "this was shown via lagrangian , as well as , eulerian numerical simulation codes @xcite . theoretically , @xcite computed the mass outflow rate for very simplistic flow configurations , in terms of inflow parameters . in the same spirit , but considering rotating accretion flow , @xcite computed the mass outflow rates from input parameters of inviscid flow where the accretion is rotating but jet was assumed to be radial .",
    "later , @xcite calculated mass loss from dissipative accretion disc considering rotating outflow .",
    "subsequently , mass outflows have been computed for variety of shocks @xcite , various types of acceleration mechanisms @xcite , and even for variable adiabatic index @xcite , using an equation of state of the flow designed to handle multi - species fluid @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that a part of the inflowing matter is periodically ejected from the disc when the viscosity parameter is chosen beyond its critical values .",
    "already , @xcite and @xcite studied the outflow properties in terms of the disc viscosity and cooling processes .",
    "the outflow rate computed from the appropriate choice of the inflow parameters is consistent with the jet kinematic luminosity estimated from the radio luminosity of the jets @xcite . here",
    ", we mean outflows as jets and not winds .",
    "jets differ from winds as they are usually fast , supersonic and collimated outflows .",
    "it is well known that the increase of accretion rate demonstrates the transition of the black hole sources from hard to softer spectral states @xcite which suggests an underlying connection between outflow properties and the spectral states .",
    "the outflow rate also depends on viscosity , which indicates that there exists a range of viscosity that allows mass loss from the disc for a given accretion rate .",
    "such critical limits of the viscosity is not studied so far and for the first time , we identify the range of viscosity for the formation of mass outflow from the accretion disc .    in the next section , we present the basic assumptions and governing equations . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the results and finally present the conclusions .",
    "we consider a steady , viscous , axisymmetric accretion flow on to a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we adopt @xcite potential to describe space - time geometry around the black hole .",
    "also , the flow is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction @xcite . in our model , jets are tenuous , and have negligible shear and therefore can be assumed to be inviscid @xcite and have low angular momentum compared to the outer edge of the disc . in this work , we use @xmath0 unit system , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the gravitational constant , the mass of the black hole , and the velocity of light , respectively .",
    "the dimensionless governing equations for accretion are @xcite ,    \\(a ) the radial momentum equation : @xmath4 ( b ) the mass conservation equation : @xmath5 ( c ) the angular momentum conservation equation : @xmath6 and ( d ) the entropy equation : @xmath7 where , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the radial distance , radial velocity , density , isotropic pressure and specific angular momentum of the flow , respectively . here , @xmath13 is vertically integrated density , @xmath14 is the specific entropy of the flow , and @xmath15 is the local temperature .",
    "the viscous stress is represented by @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 $ ] is the vertically integrated total pressure , @xmath19 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath20 is vertically integrated thermal pressure ) .",
    "the gain of heat by the flow are given by @xcite , @xmath21 where , @xmath22 is the adiabatic index , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xcite . in this work , bremsstrahlung cooling process is ignored as it is inefficient and only synchrotron cooling is considered which is given by @xcite , @xmath26 where , @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the electron charge , @xmath29 is electron mass , @xmath30 is solar mass , and @xmath31 for fully ionized plasma .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath32 is measured in units of eddington accretion rate adopting @xmath33 black hole .",
    "we use @xmath34 which is the ratio between the magnetic pressure to the gas pressure to estimate the magnetic field for synchrotron cooling . in this work ,",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are used throughout the paper .      the conserved energy equation for jet is given by @xcite ,    @xmath37 where , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the specific energy and the angular momentum of the jet , respectively .",
    "the integrated continuity equation for jet is , @xmath40 where , @xmath41 is the outflow rate , @xmath42 is the jet density , @xmath43 is the jet velocity and @xmath44 denote the area function of the jet @xcite .",
    "since a part of the accreting matter is deflected at the cenbol surface to form bidirectional outflows @xcite , therefore , our focus would be on such accretion solutions that contain stationary shocks . for shock ,",
    "accreting flow must possess two saddle type sonic points , namely inner sonic point ( @xmath45 ) and outer sonic point ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "interestingly , the range of @xmath45 is usually restricted within @xmath47 ( @xmath48 schwarzschild radius ) @xcite and we choose @xmath45 as one of the input parameters to obtain the accretion solution that includes shock wave .",
    "other input parameters are angular momentum @xmath49 at @xmath45 , viscosity @xmath50 and accretion rate @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we calculate the accretion solution by integrating the governing equations ( eqs .",
    "1a - d ) once from @xmath45 inwards and then outwards @xcite .",
    "the condition for steady shock requires conservation of energy flux , mass flux , and momentum flux across the shock front @xcite and in presence of mass loss , conservation of mass flux is taken care considering mass outflow rate @xmath51 defined as the ratio between the mass flux of the outflow ( @xmath52 ) and the pre - shock accretion rate ( @xmath53 ) @xcite which are given by ,    @xmath54 where , subscripts `` @xmath55 '' and `` @xmath56 '' refer to the quantities before and after the shock , respectively .",
    "we consider that jet is launched with the same energy , angular momentum and density of the post - shock flow and the corresponding mass outflow rate is given by @xcite , @xmath57 where , @xmath58 is the shock location , @xmath59 is the compression ratio and @xmath60 is the post - shock sound speed .",
    "we simultaneously solve the accretion - ejection equations to obtain shocks in presence of mass loss in the following way .",
    "we first find the virtual shock location @xmath61 without considering mass loss .",
    "we assign shock energy @xmath62 and angular momentum @xmath63 as the jet energy @xmath38 and @xmath39 and solve the jet equations to obtain corresponding @xmath51 .",
    "now we use @xmath51 in shock condition to find the new shock location .",
    "we continue the iteration to converge for actual shock location and the corresponding @xmath51 is the relative mass outflow rate . here , the jet is assumed to have the same energy as the post shock disc . since these bidirectional outflows are launched from the post - shock disc , therefore , the flow parameters at the jet base should be same as that of the disc from where it is being launched . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the immediate post - shock bernoulli parameter to be that of the jet .",
    "at the inner sonic point and the viscosity .",
    "different boundaries separate the parameter space for mass loss from the disc . solid boundary is for solutions having no cooling and the boundaries drawn with dotted and dot - dashed curves are for various accretion rates marked in the panel .",
    "see text for details.,width=302 ]    in this work , we intend to find the range of viscosity that admits mass loss from an advective accretion disc around the black holes . to achieve our goal , we supply the inflow parameters , namely , inner sonic points ( @xmath45 ) , angular momentum @xmath64 and viscosity ( @xmath19 ) , respectively and look for global inflow - outflow solutions . of the three parameters , we fixed angular momentum @xmath64 and vary inner sonic points ( @xmath45 ) and viscosity ( @xmath19 ) for all possible range . essentially , we identify the region of the parameter space spanned by the angular momentum @xmath64 and viscosity ( @xmath19 ) for mass loss which is shown in fig .",
    "it is indeed fascinating to see that mass loss is possible for a wide range of viscosity which again strongly depends on the angular momentum of the accreting matter at the inner part of the disc .",
    "we classify the parameter space as function of accretion rate @xmath32 and separate it with the solid , dotted and dot - dashed boundaries .",
    "solid boundary represents the cooling free solutions that are independent of @xmath32 .",
    "the dotted and dot - dashed boundaries denote the solutions that correspond to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . as the cooling",
    "is increased , the size of the post - shock region shrinks @xcite and the possibility of mass loss is reduced @xcite which is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this result has a profound implication as @xcite pointed out that with the appropriate choice of the inflow parameters , the present disc - jet model successfully explains the jet luminosity at least for two objects , namely , m87 and sgr  @xmath67 .",
    "@xcite estimated the mass outflow rate of m87 jets as @xmath68 yr@xmath69 which gives a kinematic luminosity of @xmath70ergs s@xmath69 @xcite considering few percent efficiency , while for sgr  @xmath67 the estimated mass loss was @xmath71 yr@xmath69 that also satisfies the kinematic luminosity of @xmath72ergs s@xmath69 accepted in the literature @xcite . in the similar way , with this methodology",
    "one can estimate the jet power in hard states for the galactic stellar mass black hole sources as well .    in this work ,",
    "we choose a set of @xmath22 and @xmath73 values to represent our results .",
    "we examined the dependency of mass loss parameter space on @xmath22 and observed only quantitative variation in a way that the parameter space is shifted towards the lower viscosity and angular momentum side for @xmath74 .",
    "as discussed in section 2.1 , the limit is @xmath75 and we use @xmath36 . for higher @xmath73 ,",
    "the effect of radiative loss would be more for the same accretion rate ( eq . 2c ) and thereby reduce the thermal driving of the jets .",
    "eventually , the parameter space for mass loss would further be reduced with the increase of @xmath73 values .",
    "recently @xcite reported that several gbh sources exhibit hard to hard - intermediate spectral state transition along with the increase of qpo frequency and radio and x - ray fluxes .",
    "however , during the transition from hard - intermediate to soft - intermediate state , the qpo disappears followed by the transient radio flare .",
    "this perhaps indicates that the presence of weaker / mildly relativistic , continuous jet is related to a component of the disc which is responsible for qpo .",
    "and the disappearance of qpo followed by strong radio flare shows that it is the same component of the disc which gets disrupted and expelled as strong , relativistic ejections during the hard - intermediate to soft - intermediate state transition .",
    "this observation confirms the presence of shock in accretion disc and also identifies the post - shock disc ( cenbol ) as the seat of hot electrons / comptonizing cloud whose dynamics is responsible for jet generation and qpos . with these insights",
    ", it would be intriguing to interpret the relations among the jet evolution , spectral states and qpos in greater details .",
    "indeed , some of the seminal works has already been initiated @xcite .",
    "our present effort which is the identification of ranges of viscosity parameter and accretion rate resulting steady jets , would be an insight for impending numerical simulations to study variabilities of black hole accretion - ejection system .",
    "overall , one can limit the value of viscosity parameter while explaining the jet power for numerous objects which we intend to explore elsewhere .",
