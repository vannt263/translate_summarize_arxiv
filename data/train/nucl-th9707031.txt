    "nucleon knockout by a high - energy electron in the quasi - free ( qf ) regime has extensively been used as a powerful tool to investigate single - particle properties of nuclei .",
    "the reason is that the electromagnetic interaction with nucleons is well known from quantum electrodynamics and , in the one - photon - exchange approximation and neglecting final - state interactions , the coincidence cross section for a detected electron of energy @xmath1 and angle @xmath2 and detected nucleon of angle @xmath3 has a factorised form : = k_eps(p_m , e_m ) , [ eq : factorised ] where @xmath4 is a kinematical factor , @xmath5 the elementary ( off - shell ) electron - nucleon cross section and @xmath6 the hole spectral function depending on the missing momentum @xmath7 and energy @xmath8 .",
    "the momentum @xmath7 is also the recoil momentum of the residual nucleus and @xmath8 its excitation energy with respect to the target nucleus .",
    "excitation spectra and momentum distributions of the produced hole have been measured for a variety of nuclei along the whole periodic table ( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "however , to extract from the data precise information , such as e.g. the values of spectroscopic factors , an accurate treatment of final - state interactions ( fsi ) is necessary with the result that the simple factorisation ( [ eq : factorised ] ) is destroyed  @xcite . in the one - photon - exchange approximation",
    "the general expression of the coincidence unpolarized cross section can be written in terms of four structure functions @xmath9 as  @xcite & = & 2 ^ 2 _ v k \\ { w_t + _",
    "l w_l + & & + & & + w_tl + w_tt2 } , [ eq : nonfact ] where @xmath10 is the flux of virtual photons , @xmath11 the out - of - plane angle of the proton with respect to the electron scattering plane , = ^-1,_l = q^2 ^ 2 , and @xmath12 is the negative mass squared of the virtual photon defined in terms of the momentum @xmath13 and energy @xmath14 transferred by the incident electron through a scattering angle @xmath15 . in plane - wave impulse approximation ,",
    "all structure functions become proportional to the hole spectral functions and eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorised ] ) is recovered .",
    "it turns out that for removal of valence protons a distorted - wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) is a suitable one  @xcite . on the contrary , at high missing",
    "energy and/or high missing momentum clear evidence for a better approximation has been accumulated  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , other processes beyond the simple one - body mechanism become important above the threshold of two - nucleon emission and in the socalled dip - region , i.e. in the region between the qf peak and the @xmath16-resonance excitation  @xcite .    in the dip region",
    "the semi - inclusive @xmath17cdata of ref .",
    "@xcite have been compared with two calculations , one focusing on two - body meson - exchange and @xmath16 currents  @xcite , and the other one on short - range correlations  @xcite .",
    "however , in this region many - body effects leading to multi - nucleon emission are important . limitations of the two - body process as a mechanism for understanding the reaction have been indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the qf region",
    "the one - body mechanism is dominant , but multiple scattering of the ejected proton with the residual nucleus is also important as shown by the large effects introduced by dwia .",
    "a detailed analysis of the effects of multiple scattering has only been performed in a classical approach by means of a monte carlo study  @xcite where an reaction in a given nucleus is simulated by taking into account multiple coulomb and nuclear scattering by the outgoing proton while crossing through the residual nucleus .",
    "a quantum - mechanical treatment of fsi is proposed in the present paper taking advantage of the multistep direct ( msd ) scattering theory of feshbach , kerman and koonin  @xcite .",
    "the msd theory has been extensively applied to describe the continuum spectrum in nuclear reactions for energies up to the pion threshold ( see  @xcite and references therein ; @xcite-@xcite ) establishing the validity of the theory over a wide range of energies and target nuclei .",
    "the reactions are described as a series of two - body interactions between the projectile and the target nucleons leading to the excitation of intermediate states of increasing complexity . at each stage a nucleon may be emitted contributing to the pre - equilibrium energy spectrum .",
    "the theory combines a quantum - mechanical treatment of multistep scattering with statistical assumptions that lead to the convolution nature of the multistep cross sections and enables the calculation of higher order contributions  up to six steps  which would otherwise be impracticable .    in the present paper",
    "we apply the multistep scattering theory to describe the continuum spectrum of the qf knockout reaction . following the electromagnetic interaction between the scattered electron and the target nucleus ,",
    "a target nucleon is excited to the continuum with energy @xmath18 and angle @xmath19 and subsequently undergoes a series of two - body interactions with the residual nucleons before being emitted with energy @xmath20 and angle @xmath3 .",
    "we aim to give a quantitative estimate of the multi - scattering effects in the high missing energy region as a first step in the study of fsi .    in sect .",
    "2 the msd theory is briefly recalled and adapted to describe the proton emission in reactions .",
    "calculational details are given in sect .",
    "3 and the results obtained in a case example are discussed in sect .",
    "the msd theory has been described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite so here we give a brief account of the theoretical formalism adapted to reactions without details of the derivations .",
    "the average cross section for an ejectile electron of energy @xmath1 and angle @xmath2 and ejectile proton of energy @xmath20 and angle @xmath3 is written as an incoherent sum of a one - step and multistep ( @xmath21-step ) terms = + _ n=2^ , [ eq : msdeep ] where the @xmath21-step term is given by a convolution of the direct knockout cross sections and one - step msd cross sections over all intermediate energies @xmath22 and angles @xmath23 obeying energy and momentum conservation rules :    @xmath24    the cross section for the direct knockout reaction is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonfact ] ) after having included the energy distribution ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : distrib ] ) below ) .",
    "the one - step msd cross sections for the subsequent nn scatterings are calculated by extending the dwba theory to the continuum and can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the orbital angular momentum transfer , @xmath27 is the average of dwba cross sections exciting 1p1h states consistent with energy , angular momentum and parity conservation and @xmath28 is the density of such states with residual nucleus energy @xmath29 .",
    "the latter is factorised into a level - dependent density and a spin distribution , @xmath30 . the energy - dependent density @xmath31 is obtained from an equidistant fermi - gas model with finite hole - depth restrictions taken into account .",
    "@xmath32 is a gaussian spin distribution , @xmath33 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 the spin cut - off parameter .",
    "the transitions are induced by an effective nn interaction which is given by a finite - range yukawa potential with strength @xmath35 adjusted to reproduce the experimental ( p , p@xmath36 ) cross sections .",
    "the qf cross sections were calculated in dwia  @xcite , including the effect of coulomb distortion of the electron waves , through the effective momentum approximation , which is a good approximation for light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a full out - of - plane kinematics was considered , with an outgoing - proton energy up to the maximum value compatible with the energy distribution of the bound single - particle states .",
    "the distorted waves were thus obtained from the optical potential of ref .",
    "@xcite which extends up to energies of 150 mev and the bound - state wavefunctions from a woods - saxon potential with a radius parameter @xmath37 fm , diffuseness @xmath38 fm  @xcite and a depth fixed to reproduce the input energy eigenvalues .",
    "the quantum numbers and energy eigenvalues of the states that can be excited were obtained from a spherical nilsson shell model scheme  @xcite .",
    "such a scheme has been adopted because it is easily extended into the continuum as required in calculating the msd cross section .",
    "the price of consistency between bound and continuum states is , however , paid by removal energies that are somehow different from experimental values .",
    "the energy distribution of the bound states was taken as a lorentzian  @xcite    s(e_m ) = , [ eq : distrib ] where @xmath39 is the g.s .",
    "nucleon binding energy and @xmath40 the fermi energy of the nilsson level scheme .",
    "the energy dependent width is given by  @xcite    ( e_m ) = , [ eq : width ] where the energies are in mev .",
    "the msd cross sections were calculated using dwuck4  @xcite to obtain the microscopic dwba cross sections with a yukawa effective nn potential of range 1 fm .",
    "the strength of the potential @xmath35 was extracted from previous studies of the systematics of the ( p , p@xmath36 ) reaction on the atomic mass @xmath41 and the incident energy  @xcite . for sake of consistency",
    "the same distorted waves and bound - state wavefunctions were used for the calculation of the and dwba ( p , p@xmath36 ) cross - sections .",
    "the microscopic transitions are averaged over transferred angular momentum and residual nucleus energy by the msd code  @xcite according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : onestep ] ) where the 1p1h state density was calculated with an average single - particle density @xmath42  @xcite and the spin cut - off parameter of its spin distribution was given by @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "when calculating the multistep cross sections with eq .",
    "( [ eq : msdneep ] ) the one - step msd cross sections are obtained at several incident energies lower than that of the excited proton of the direct knockout reaction and interpolated for other values .",
    "the convolution integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : msdneep ] ) is then evaluated using monte carlo integration ( msd code  @xcite ) .",
    "the approach to msd scattering of the ejectile proton presented in the previous sections was applied to the @xmath0careaction as a case example .",
    "the @xmath0ca nucleus is an appropriate target for the statistical treatment of the msd theory and data at high missing energy exist with the following kinematics  @xcite : the incident electron energy is @xmath44 mev , the electron scattering angle @xmath45 and the outgoing proton energy @xmath46 mev . the scattered electron energy @xmath1 varied in the experiment from 350 to 410 mev . in our calculations we fixed @xmath47 mev and worked at constant @xmath48 by varying the proton energy @xmath20 accordingly .",
    "this kinematics is unable to reach missing momenta @xmath49 mev/@xmath50 for the deep states , contrary to the experimental situation , where the detector acceptances also allow to probe low values of missing momenta .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the theoretical direct knockout and multistep cross sections as a function of the angle @xmath51 between the emitted proton @xmath52 and the momentum transfer @xmath13 at four different residual nucleus energies @xmath53 . at the lowest excitation energies , the direct nucleon knockout process dominates and exhibits a strong forward - peaking .",
    "the multistep contributions are important at large scattering angles over the whole energy range . with increasing excitation energy",
    "the two - step and three - step contributions become gradually more important than the one - step direct process over most of the angular range , apart from the very small scattering angles @xmath54 .",
    "the domination of multistep processes at large scattering angles is expected since as a result of multistep scattering the leading proton gradually loses memory of its initial direction yielding thus increasingly symmetric angular distributions .    in order to compare with data it is useful to define the reduced cross section as ( p_m , e_m ) = , [ eq : reduced ] where",
    "@xmath55 is the electron - nucleon cross section taken according to ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we compare @xmath56 integrated over two different energy ranges with the experimental data of ref .",
    "the theoretical curves are multiplied by 0.5 , a factor that can be interpreted as an average spectroscopic factor . at low missing energies the direct process dominates , whereas at high @xmath8",
    "the major contribution comes from two - step and three - step processes .",
    "the relative importance of multistep processes increases with the missing momentum and is analogous to the behaviour of the multistep cross sections at large scattering angles in fig . 1 .",
    "we have calculated the multi - nucleon - nucleon scattering contributions in reactions in the quasi - free region using the msd theory of ref .",
    "@xcite , and have shown that such processes are important at high missing energy and momentum .",
    "therefore , one can foresee that in other kinematics involving even higher missing energy and momentum values like , e.g. , in the dip region  @xcite , multistep scattering processes would be helpful in determining the final - sate interaction .",
