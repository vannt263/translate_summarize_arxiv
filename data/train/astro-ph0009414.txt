    "moreover , this long range implies that the interaction is self - similar and does not pick up itself a favored coarsening length .",

    "the parameter @xmath143 measures the pancake thickness in the physical coordinates .",
    "this study also shows that for the cases @xmath144 the solution approaches so fast its asymptotic values at large distances that in fact @xmath145 at two finite values of the normal coordinate , @xmath146 and @xmath147 . in such cases ,",
    "the solution ( [ generalsol ] ) must be replaced beyond these points by : @xmath148 , @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) .    from the general solution ( [ generalsol ] )",

    "the conclusion is therefore that the adhesive - like behavior is a robust property of the whole family of models ( [ epsilonadhs ] ) parametrized by @xmath119 : whenever the dust evolution ( @xmath104 ) predicts a singularity , this must be replaced by the `` adhesive prescription '' ( [ limit ] ) , which leads , via the continuity equation ( [ hydrosmallk]a ) , to a steady accretion of mass .",
    "i have derived and applied a hydrodynamic - like formulation for the process of cosmological structure formation : this is a nontrivial statement , because one could believe that the collisionless nature of the basic model ( [ newton ] ) renders a `` fluid '' description impossible after shell - crossing , and that then one should employ a different approach , e.g. the bbgky hierarchy .",
    "i have shown , however , that a `` fluid '' description is feasible after the breakdown of the dust model : what makes a difference with `` down - to - earth '' fluids is how the closure of the hydrodynamic hierarchy ( [ hydro ] ) is achieved .",
    "for this pupose , i have introduced the large - scale expansion , which builds on the assumption that the large - scale evolution is insensitive to the small scales .",
    "this assumption lies behind many reasonings in the cosmological literature : for example , behind the idea that on large scales the evolution follows a friedmann - lematre model , regardless of the small - scale inhomogeneities , and also behind the confidence on cosmological n - body simulations , where each n - body particle is so massive that it must correspond in the real world to a full structure in its own , composed of many smaller particles .",
    "the plausibility of the assumption can be argued on the basis of the long range of gravity : the evolution can be expected to be dominated by the large scales provided there is enough large - scale power initially .",
    "( one can then also expect that the validity of the large - scale expansion should depend on the initial and boundary conditions ) .",
    "the good agreement with n - body simulations of the truncated za and the adhesion model @xcite , in which small - scale structure is completely disregarded , can be viewed as a support of this large - scale dominance .    from the derived hydrodynamic equations ,",
    "i have shown how the dust model arises as the lowest - order term in the large - scale expansion , while the first - order correction gives rise to a model which can be reduced to the adhesion model by further approximations .",
    "this derivation provides a clear physical interpretation of the two models : the `` particles '' which are assumed to follow the dust model are not such but have an internal structure , and the `` interaction '' between these `` particles '' due to its internal structure explains the adhesive behavior . by applying boundary - layer techniques , i found in particular that this behavior is a robust property of the model , in the sense that it arises quite independently of the detailed dependence of the velocity dispersion and the tidal correction on the density and velocity fields .",
    "it is interesting to compare this work with previous , related works dealing also with a hydrodynamic - like formulation of large - scale structure formation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the case is studied in which the hydrodynamic hierarchy is truncated by a _",
    "phenomenological _ ansatz which writes the corrections to the adhesion model as a stochastic term ( a noise ) . the adhesion model , in turn , was justified in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a relativistic generalization ) by disregarding the tidal correction altogether and by letting the velocity dispersion be given as @xmath155 .",
    "the robustness of the adhesive property already mentioned explains why this behavior also arises in the models that follow from this truncation .",
    "it is particularly instructive to compare with the work in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a truncation relying on something else than phenomenology was studied .",
    "i have been able to close the hydrodynamic hierarchy with less restrictive assumptions and thus shown that the adhesive behavior can still be recovered when assumptions ( a2 ) ( isotropic @xmath39 ) and ( a4 ) and ( a5 ) ( further restrictions on the form of @xmath39 ) in sec .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite are dropped .",
    "assumption ( a1 ) seems in practice equivalent to the large - scale expansion , while i also employed assumption ( a3 ) ( parallelism ) in order to derive adhesion - like models .",
    "but there is also a major improvement compared to that work : i do not assume the mean - field approximation from the outset ( and thus the vlasov equation , which was the starting point in ref .",
    "in fact , i could derive an expression for the tidal correction and show that it also behaves `` adhesively '' . as explained in more detail in app .",
    "[ appi ] , this correction is also the origin for the discrepancy between expression ( [ pismallk ] ) and the relationship @xmath156 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , i have shown that the derivation of adhesion - like models requires in principle further assumptions than the simple large - scale expansion .",
    "thus , one could improve on these models by relaxing those assumptions and rather studying eqs .",
    "( [ hydrosmallk ] ) .",
    "an important difference between the adhesion - like models and eqs .",
    "( [ hydrosmallk ] ) is that the corrections to dust in the latter generate vorticity , even if it is initially absent : this may be a relevant feature when modelling galaxy formation .",
    "another difference is that now there is no need in principle to retain the condition @xmath157 : pancakes and other singularities are no longer of vanishing volume , but have an inner structure whose evolution could be studied with eqs .",
    "( [ hydrosmallk ] ) . for such purpose",
    ", the role of the length @xmath14 must be better understood .",
    "i would like to thank c. beisbart , t. buchert and h. wagner for their useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "a _ smoothing window _",
    "@xmath13@xcite should behave as a _ window _ that defines a bounded region of space and as a _ smoothing _ filter that erases the structural details inside this region .",
    "these conditions are implemented by requiring @xmath13 and its fourier transform @xmath158 to decay faster than any power as @xmath159 or @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "the smoothing window acts as an integral kernel : if @xmath161 is a given field , then the associated coarse - grained field @xmath162 over the scale @xmath14 and its fourier transform @xmath163 are given by    [ coarsegraining ] @xmath164",
    "@xmath165    therefore , the coarse - grained field at point @xmath19 is just the ( weigthed ) addition of the original field over a region of size @xmath18 around that point .",
    "two more conditions are also required : ( i ) @xmath166 , so that the contribution from the neighborhood of the center of the window is unweighted ; ( ii ) @xmath167 , so that the coarse - grained field has the same large - scale structure as the original field .",
    "this latter condition implies the following normalization : @xmath168 so that @xmath169 , and @xmath170 .",
    "the condition on the decay of @xmath158 for large @xmath171 prevents the window @xmath13 from having sharp borders , which thus becomes a `` fuzzy '' window . otherwise , the coarse - grained field @xmath162 could change in a discontinuous manner as the center of the window , @xmath19 , sweeps the system . in the same way , the fast decay of @xmath13 for large @xmath172 ( which implies that @xmath158 lacks sharp borders in fourier space ) implies the property of spatial locality for the coarse - grained field .",
    "this also guarantees the existence of the taylor - expansion of @xmath158 at @xmath173 in the form : @xmath174 where the constant @xmath175 is related to the quadrupole moment of the smoothing window .",
    "the required constraints on the smoothing window exclude a step function ( either in real or in fourier space ) .",
    "a useful function which satisfies the constraints is a gaussian : @xmath176 .",
    "in this appendix i study the evolution equation for the velocity dispersion and show that ( [ pismallk ] ) is a solution of the equation .",
    "the purpose is to compare with the result in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath39 , also obtained from the evolution equation for this tensor .",
    "starting from the definition ( [ veldis ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ newton]a ) and ( [ newton]b ) , one can obtain the following equation for the temporal evolution of the velocity dispersion : @xmath177 where a summation over repeated indices is implied , and a second - rank and a third - rank tensor fields have been defined :    [ pandl ] @xmath178         [ { \\bf w}_{mic}({\\bf y } , t ) - { \\bf w } ( { \\bf x } , t ; l ) ] +         \\nonumber \\\\        \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad        \\qquad\\qquad        + [ { \\bf w}_{mic}({\\bf y } , t ) - { \\bf w}({\\bf x } , t ; l ) ]         [ { \\bf u}_{mic}({\\bf y } , t ) - { \\bf u } ( { \\bf x } , t ; l ) ]      \\big\\ } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath179       [ { \\bf u}_{mic}({\\bf y } , t ) - { \\bf u } ( { \\bf x } , t ; l ) ]       [ { \\bf u}_{mic}({\\bf y } , t ) - { \\bf u}({\\bf x } , t ; l ) ] .\\ ] ]    the term @xmath180 accounts for the change of velocity dispersion due to the exchange of particles between the coarsening cells , while the term @xmath181 represents the change due to the gravitational interaction . to get a physical picture ,",
    "just consider the equation for the trace of @xmath39 ( the internal kinetic energy ) : then @xmath180 reduces to the equivalent of the kinetic contribution to the heat flux in the usual hydrodynamics , while @xmath181 becomes the power performed by the gravitational interaction .",
    "compared to eq .",
    "( 4c ) of @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ pieq ] ) contains the extra term @xmath181 , and the reason is that this term drops if tidal corrections are neglected . indeed , if one performs a large - scale expansion of @xmath181 and @xmath180 in the same way as explained in sec .",
