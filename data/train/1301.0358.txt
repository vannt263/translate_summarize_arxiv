    "a new generation of experiments realizing two - dimensional ( 2d ) atomic fermi gases provide a unique possibility to systematically explore 2d quantum systems , including phenomena relevant to high temperature and organic superconductors , and @xmath0he films  @xcite .",
    "the study of collective modes has proven to be a powerful way to probe the properties of 3d atomic gases including the effects of pairing and strong correlations  @xcite .",
    "the damping of these modes is related to the transport properties of the gases , and in particular the damping of the quadrupole mode is controlled by the shear viscosity in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "the shear viscosity of quantum fermi fluids has received lots of interest due to the conjectured minimum of the ratio of viscosity and entropy  @xcite .",
    "recently , the first experiments concerning the collective modes of a 2d fermi gas have been performed  @xcite .",
    "the breathing mode frequency was reported to be very close to that of an ideal gas with a low and constant damping throughout the different interaction regimes , which indicates a scale invariant system with a very small bulk viscosity  @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole mode was shown to exhibit a clear transition between collisionless and hydrodynamic behavior with increasing coupling strength . following this experiment , the shear viscosity for a 2d gas",
    "was calculated using kinetic theory , and the result was then used to calculate the quadrupole mode damping in the hydrodynamic limit  @xcite . from the good agreement between experimental data for the quadrupole mode and a numerical solution of the boltzmann equation",
    ", it was concluded that kinetic theory provides an accurate description in the temperature and coupling strength regime relevant to the experiment  @xcite .",
    "here , we calculate the frequency and damping of the energetically lowest collective modes of a 2d fermi gas as a function of temperature and coupling strength from approximate analytic solutions to the boltzmann equation obtained by expanding it in appropriate basis functions .",
    "the effects of pauli blocking and pairing correlations on the collision rate are systematically analyzed , and we show that for strong coupling there is a large temperature regime where pairing correlations dominate the effects of pauli blocking .",
    "this indicates a large so - called pairing pseudo - gap region in the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "our predictions for the mode frequencies and damping are shown to agree well with the experimental results .",
    "in particular , the theory reproduces quite well the collisionless to hydrodynamic cross - over of the quadrupole mode with increasing coupling strength . by including the effects of a possible slight trap anisotropy",
    ", we show that the resulting coupling between quadrupole and breathing modes can lead to additional damping of the breathing mode even when the bulk viscosity is zero .",
    "this result can be important for a proper interpretation of experiments .",
    "+ our paper is organized as follows : first we derive the collective mode frequencies using the method of moments",
    ". then we proceed by calculating the collision rate using various levels of approximations .",
    "we demonstrate that the collision rate can be larger than that of a classical gas due to pairing correlations .",
    "our results are then shown to provide a good quantitative description of the experimentally observed collective modes .",

    "the classical collision rate monotonically increases as the temperature is lowered as a consequence of the increasing density .",
    "when pauli blocking is included this behavior is drastically different , since the exclusion principle freezes out collisions in the degenerate regime @xmath97 .",
    "this freezing out results in a maximum of the collision rate as a function of temperature as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "this picture is further modified when medium corrections in the @xmath34-matrix are included . here",
    "the proximity to the bcs instability towards pair formation gives rise to resonant behavior for particles colliding with opposite momenta near the fermi surface . in the strong coupling regime @xmath98",
    ", this causes a dramatic increase in the scattering rate over a large temperature range , diverging at the mean - field bcs transition temperature @xmath99 given by the thouless criterion , as indicated by the dashed vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "while there is strictly speaking no phase transition at @xmath99 in 2d , this should be considered as the temperature where pairing sets in , but fluctuations prevent superfluid order as long as @xmath10 is above the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless temperature @xmath100  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "this over - compensation is consistent with what was found for the shear viscosity and spin diffusion coefficient  @xcite .",
    "medium corrections to the scattering in the strong coupling regime are thus even larger in 2d than in 3d  @xcite , which can be interpreted as showing the presence of a large so - called pairing pseudo - gap regime above the superfluid transition temperature @xmath100  @xcite .    on the molecular side , sufficiently far beyond the bcs transition ,",
    "the collision rate is again finite .",
    "this is because the pole of the @xmath34-matrix is below the integration region in the collision integral , where the @xmath34-matrix is evaluated on shell for the collision process . in this limit",
    ", our theory effectively describes a repulsive fermi gas in the upper branch  @xcite .",

    "we now compare our theoretical results with the experimental data of ref .",
    "we focus on the experimental values for the temperature @xmath95 where the available data had the best signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "also , analysis techniques have been adjusted and refined for this temperature , which marginally changed the experimental data points without changing the overall results and statements of ref .",
    "it should be emphasized that the theoretical expressions for the frequency and damping contain no free parameters to fit theory and experiment . in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( a ) and  [ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) we plot the frequency and damping of the quadrupole mode . as for the collision rate",
    ", we show three different curves : a classical calculation ( blue dashed curve ) , a calculation including pauli blocking ( black solid curve ) , and a calculation where both fermi blocking and medium effects on the @xmath34-matrix are included ( red dotted curve ) .",
    "we see that there is good agreement with the experimental results for quadrupole frequency and damping rates . in particular , the onset of the hydrodynamic regime around @xmath101 and the location of the maximum damping rate seen in the experiment agree with our calculations .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] that the collision rate including medium corrections in the scattering matrix is in between the classical result and the pauli blocking result for @xmath102 and @xmath95 .",
    "this explains why the frequency in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is in between the classical and the pauli blocking predictions in this regime . when @xmath103 the medium collision rate is larger than the classical prediction , but in this regime the mode frequency is already very close to the hydrodynamic value , so there is no visible difference between the classical and the medium prediction for the frequency . the higher collision rate when medium corrections are included does , however , yield a smaller damping in the hydrodynamic regime , as can be see from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ( b ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it appears that including medium corrections gives a slightly worse agreement with the experimental results compared to the theory that includes only pauli blocking .",
    "experimentally , when tuning from attractive interactions beyond @xmath104 one observes rapid heating of the gas , qualitatively in agreement with the expectation of increased pairing correlations yielding a higher three - body loss rate when entering the pairing pseudo - gap region @xmath105 .",
    "we note that our theoretical approach is not valid in the paired regime , and further theoretical studies are needed to fully address the collective modes at low temperatures .",
    "it is typically quite difficult to achieve perfect symmetric traps in experiments . in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , there is some uncertainty in the value of the trapping frequencies @xmath106 and @xmath107 so that the trap may not be perfectly isotropic in the @xmath54-plane .",
    "instead , one typically has an upper bound of @xmath108 for the anisotropy .",
    "an anisotropic trap results in coupled breathing and quadrupole modes  @xcite , and we shall now show that this can have important consequences on the interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "we consider an anisotropic trap with @xmath109 .",
    "to describe the coupled breathing and quadrupole modes , we use a generalized version of the basis functions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : basis1]-[eq : basis2 ] ) : @xmath110 the calculation of the collective modes using this basis set is described in the appendix . after a straightforward but rather lengthy calculation",
    ", we obtain that the normal mode frequencies are the solutions of @xmath111 with @xmath112 the collisionless frequencies .",
    "the hydrodynamic frequencies are @xmath113 the collision time @xmath69 appearing in eq .",
    "is identical to the collision time for an isotropic trap , when evaluated at the same fugacity @xmath114 , since we can eliminate any dependence on trap frequencies by rescaling the real - space coordinates @xmath115,@xmath116 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : normalmodes ] we show the frequencies and damping rates of these modes as a function of the collision time @xmath69 for @xmath117 .",
    "the coupling of the breathing and quadrupole modes is clearly visible . in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : normalmodes ] , we compare our theory with the experimental data for the frequency and damping of the breathing mode in ref .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "3 ( a ) shows the separately measured cloud - width oscillation frequencies in the @xmath115 , and @xmath116 directions of the breathing mode as a function of interaction strength . in the collisionless regime ( @xmath118 )",
    "the oscillations along the principal axes of the system are decoupled .",
    "the frequency difference directly reveals the system s anisotropy of about 5% . towards the hydrodynamic regime the motion along the main axes start to couple , leading to a single collective mode in the strong coupling limit [ @xmath119 .",
    "the breathing mode frequency in that regime lies below the theoretical prediction , probably due to the anisotropy , which couples the monopole mode with the quadrupole mode .",
    "an important consequence of this coupling is that there is a viscous damping of the breathing mode , which is undamped for an isotropic harmonic trap as the kinetic theory yields zero bulk viscosity .",
    "this potentially complicates the interpretation of the observed damping of the breathing mode in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , since it is necessary to separate the damping due to non - zero shear viscosity caused by a possible trap anisotropy from damping due to non - zero bulk viscosity .",
    "in fact , the inset of fig . [",
    "fig : normalmodes ] ( b ) demonstrates that a small trap anisotropy of @xmath120-@xmath121% can qualitatively explain the slight increase in damping of the breathing mode  @xcite with coupling strength observed in ref .",
    "this additional source of damping makes the bulk viscosity extracted from the damping even smaller , and more measurements are needed in order to pin down how small the bulk viscosity is and to compare with theory  @xcite .",
    "we studied the collective modes of a 2d fermi gas using kinetic theory . expanding the boltzmann equation on basis functions",
    ", we obtained analytical results for the frequency and damping of the collective modes as a function of temperature and coupling strength , which were shown to agree well with experimental data .",
    "we demonstrated that there is a large temperature range for strong coupling , where pairing correlations dominate the effects of pauli blocking on the collision rate , resulting in a rate higher than the classical value .",
    "finally , we showed that the coupling between the breathing and the quadrupole modes due to a slight anisotropy within experimental bounds , may result in a damping of the breathing mode even when the bulk viscosity is zero .",
