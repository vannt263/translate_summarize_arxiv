    "these sources display sporadic outbursts lasting from minutes to hours with peak luminosities of @xmath010@xmath1 - 10@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 , and spend long time intervals at lower x - ray luminosities , ranging from @xmath010@xmath6  erg  s@xmath3 to @xmath010@xmath5  erg  s@xmath3 . in some sfxts a very faint state , with a typical luminosity of @xmath010@xmath4  erg  s@xmath3 has also been observed .",
    "the outbursts of sfxts have so far been studied in relatively fairly detail , whereas the lower luminosity states remained poorly known due to the paucity of long pointings with high sensitivity x - ray telescopes .",
    "data collected with both wide field instruments , such as ,  and imaging x - ray telescopes , such as those on board ,  and ,  showed that the outburst spectra are well described by a power law of photon index @xmath7@xmath81 - 2 and an absorption column density that is larger than the interstellar galactic value ( @xmath9@xmath010@xmath10 - 10@xmath11  @xmath12 , * ? ? ?",

    "different models make different predictions with respect to properties and origin of states with luminosities below the outburst levels .",
    "observations of these states , however , are still sparse and the properties of sfxts at low luminosities are poorly known at present .",
    "it is generally believed that the x - ray luminosity in these states is powered by residual accretion onto the ns , taking place at much reduced rate than in outburst .",
    "in fact , large variations in the mass accretion rates in sfxts are expected due to : i ) a centrifugal and/or magnetic gating mechanism acting on a moderately clumpy wind @xcite ; ii ) clumps in the wind of the supergiant companion with extreme velocity and/or density contrasts @xcite ; iii ) the presence of two components with different densities in the wind of the supergiant companion @xcite . according to interpretation ( i ) , the wide dynamic range in the x - ray luminosity ( up to @xmath05 decades ) displayed by sfxts , if accompanied by a slow spin period ( @xmath15100  s ) , might indicate that these sources host `` magnetars '' ( i.e. , neutron stars with extremely high magnetic fields , @xmath010@xmath16 g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during very faint states , an important contribution to the x - ray luminosity may also derive from shocks in the strong wind of the ob supergiant star @xcite .    here",
    "we report on the first long high sensitivity observation ( @xmath032  ks ) of the sfxt 16479 ,  when the source was in a low activity state .",
    "this source was detected in outbursts many times and appears to be characterized by a persistent luminosity of @xmath010@xmath5  erg  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the  target of opportunity observation was carried out after  discovered a very bright outburst from this source on march 19 @xcite , and was aimed at investigating its low level emission and gaining insight in the physical mechanisms that drive its activity .",
    "@xcite observed 16479  between march 21 14:40:00ut and march 22 01:30:00ut for a total time span of @xmath037  ks .",
    "the epic - pn and epic - mos cameras were operated in the small - window and full frame mode , respectively .",
    "we processed the observation data files ( odfs ) by using the standard  science analysis system ( sas  7.1 ) .",
    "the total effective exposure time was @xmath032  ks ; the remaining observing time was discarded due to high radiation from solar activity .",
    "the epic - mos data were strongly contaminated by single reflections photons from a nearby bright source ( likely 4u1642 - 45 ) , and thus we report in the following on the analysis of the epic - pn data only .",
    "the extracted images , spectra and light curves were analyzed by using heasoft version 6.4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lcurve ] shows the 2 - 10  kev epic - pn light curve of the observation : in the first @xmath04  ks 16479  was caught during the decay from a higher ( `` a '' ) to a lower ( `` b '' ) flux state .",
    "the latter extended for most of the observation ( @xmath028  ks ) .",
    "we used a bin time of 1000  s in all the light curve fits ; all errors are 90% confidence level .",
    "the mean count rate during state b was 0.024@xmath170.002 , i.e. , a factor @xmath050 lower than the maximum count rate during state a.    in order to search for spectral changes , we extracted light curves in the 2 - 5  kev and 5 - 10  kev bands .",
    "these are shown in the insert in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcurve ] ( first 8  ks of the observation ) .",
    "a fit with an exponential model plus a constant revealed a much slower decay in the soft band light curve : the e - folding time was 5400@xmath171500  s and 910@xmath17100  s , in the 2 - 5  kev and 5 - 10  kev bands , respectively .",
    "the energy spectra of states a and b are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , and were rebinned in order to have at least 20 counts per bin",
    ". fits to these spectra were tried first by assuming an absorbed power law plus a gaussian line at @xmath06.4  kev .",
    "this model provided a good fit to the spectrum of state a ( reduced @xmath18=1.1 ) for a flatter power law index ( 0.4@xmath19 ) than previously measured for the source ( 1.6@xmath170.2 , * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "the absorption column density was marginally larger ( 1.2@xmath20 @xmath2110@xmath11  @xmath12 as opposed to @xmath07@xmath2110@xmath10  @xmath12 ) . during state",
    "b this simple model gave a poorer fit ( reduced @xmath18=1.7 ) , a much reduced column density ( 4.0@xmath22 @xmath2110@xmath10  @xmath12 ) and a power law index compatible with that of state a. the equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe fluorescence line at @xmath23  kev showed a striking increase from @xmath24  ev ( state a ) to @xmath0900  ev ( state b ) .",
    "this indicated that in state b ( most of ) the x - ray flux from the source was obscured along our line of sight , but kept on shining on the fe - line emitting material .",
    "the shape of the light curve ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lcurve ] ) and evolution of the spectrum across the state a - state b transition presented also remarkable similarities with the eclipse ingress of eclipsing x - ray sources such as oao1657 - 415 @xcite . moreover the slower decay of the soft x - ray light curve ( in turn similar to that observed in oao1657 - 415 ) suggested that 16479  is seen through an extended dust - scattering halo ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to confirm this we analysed the radial distribution of the x - ray photons detected from 16479  and compared it with the point spread function ( psf ) of the  telescope / epic - pn camera ( hew of @xmath012.5  ) .",
    "we did this separately in the 2 - 5  kev and 5 - 10  kev bands for states a and b. the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] .",
    "the radial distribution of photons from 16479  was compatible with the  psf for both energy ranges during state a and for the 5 - 10  kev range during state b. on the contrary the 2 - 5  kev source photons during state b had a considerably more extended distribution than the  psf .",
    "this behaviour is precisely the one expected from a quickly obscured source seen through a dust scattering halo : soft x - ray photon emitted when the source is unobscured are scattered along our line of sight by interstellar dust , reaching us also after x - ray source obscuration , as a results of the longer path that they follow .",
    "the dust scattering halo is most prominent at low energies ( due to the energy dependence of the scattering cross section ) and when the source is obscured , because contamination by direct photons from the source is virtually absent . for a halo size @xmath25 of tens of arcsec radius ( see the top - right panel of fig .",
    "3 ) and the estimated source distance of 4.9  kpc @xcite , the longer path followed by scattered photons gives rise to a delay ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fractional distance of the halo from the source , @xmath28 is the source distance in unit of 4.9  kpc , and we used @xmath25=30  and @xmath27=1/2 .",
    "the typical delay is thus of few hours , in agreement with the e - folding decay time of the soft x - ray light curve in state b.    motivated by the above findings we considered the spectral model that has been used in studies of eclipsing x - ray binaries seen through a dust - scattering halo , that is @xcite @xmath29 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the continuum consists of three components seen through an interstellar column density of @xmath9 : two power laws with  the same  photon index @xmath30 ( normalizations @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , and a third power law with photon index @xmath33=@xmath30 + 2 ( normalization @xmath34 ) .",
    "the two power laws with the same photon index represent respectively , the source emission that is received directly at the earth ( i.e. , the direct component ) , and the source emission that is scattered along our line of sight by material in the immediate surroundings of the x - ray source , likely the wind from the massive companion star ( we term this `` wind scattered component '' ) .",
    "the scattered component will preserve the slope of the incident spectrum , while photoelectric absorption by the wind material can in principle reduce the number of low energy photons that are scattered , thus mimicking a higher column density in the scattered component .",
    "this is why the wind scattering term in eq .",
    "[ eq : xspec ] comprises an extra absorption component ( @xmath35 ) . iron features ( around @xmath23  kev and @xmath36  kev",
    "see fig .  2 )",
    "are represented by the gaussians in eq .",
    "[ eq : xspec ] and arise also from reprocessing of the source radiation in the wind . the direct component is expected to dominate the x - ray emission when the source is out of eclipse .",
    "as the ns approaches the companion s limb , the source photons directly reaching us will propagate through denser and denser regions of the companion s wind , such that increased photoelectric absorption is to be expected shortly before the eclipse ingress ( @xmath37@xmath13@xmath35 ) .",
    "the third power law component , with photon index @xmath33=@xmath30 + 2 , originates from small angle scattering of ( mainly ) direct photons off interstellar dust grains along the line of sight @xcite ; therefore , it should be characterized by a similar column density to that of the direct component away from eclipse .",
    "the dust scattering cross section decreases steeply for increasing photon energies , such that the spectrum of the scattered photons is softened by a factor of @xmath38 .",
    "both the wind and dust scattered components are expected to be most prominent during the eclipse , when the direct component is occulted by the companion star .",
    "owing to limited statistics and degeneracy in some the of spectral fit parameters , it proved impossible to disentangle the contribution from the two power laws of index @xmath30 in the  spectra of 16479 .   in practice",
    "we fitted a model with only two continuum components , a single power law of slope @xmath30 ( with normalisation @xmath39 and column density @xmath40 ) and a power law of slope @xmath33 ( with normalisation @xmath41 and column density @xmath42 ) .",
    "the former component was taken to approximate the sum of the two @xmath30-slope power laws in eq .",
    "[ eq : xspec ] , with the direct component dominating before the eclipse ingress and the wind scattered component dominating during the eclipse .",
    "the relevant model was thus @xmath43 \\label{eq : ccc}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we kept @xmath30 fixed at 0.98 , the best fit value found by @xcite when the source was in outburst ( and thus away from an x - ray eclipse ) ; consequently we fixed also @xmath33=2.98 .",
    "the best fit models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , and the corresponding parameters are given in table  [ tab : fit ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : unfolded ] we plot also the unfolded spectra . while in state a , a power law component with slope @xmath30 plus a gaussian line at @xmath44  kev ( ew of @xmath45  ev ) provided a reasonably good fit also for a fixed value of @xmath46 ( @xmath18/d.o.f.=33/28 ) .",
    "however , adding the dust scattered component significantly improved the fit ( @xmath18/d.o.f.=20.4/26 ) . in state",
    "a the relatively high source flux and small ew of the iron fluorescence line testifies that ( most of ) the emission is likely due to the direct component . in order to investigate this",
    ", we also accumulated spectra during the first 1.5  ks and last 2.5  ks of state a ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "these two spectra were reasonably fit ( @xmath18/d.o.f.=18.6/16 , 13.3/9 ) by assuming an absorbed powerlaw with fixed photon index 0.98 and an absorption column density of 30@xmath47@xmath2110@xmath10  @xmath12 and 5.6@xmath48@xmath2110@xmath10  @xmath12 , respectively ( the addition of a gaussian line at @xmath06.5  kev did not significantly improved any of these fits ) .",
    "we interpreted the decreasing absorption column density revealed by these fits as the effect of a change in the dominating spectral component during the early ingress to the eclipse .",
    "specifically , the direct component dominates the first part of the state a and is absorbed by the very dense companion s limb ; instead , most of the x - ray emission during the last 2.5  ks of this state is likely due to the wind scattered component , which is in turn absorbed by a lower dense material , in agreement with the expectation @xmath37@xmath13@xmath35 discussed above .    in state b ,",
    "the ratio @xmath39/@xmath41 is larger than the corresponding value obtained during state a , indicating a dust scattering halo whose intensity decreases slowly during the eclipse .",
    "the intensity of the power law of slope @xmath30 decreased substantially , while the ew of the fe - line at @xmath44  kev increased to @xmath0770  ev .",
    "we also found evidence ( @xmath02@xmath49 ) for an additional fe - line at @xmath50  kev with a @xmath0300  ev ew , consistent with being the @xmath51 .",
    "owing to the poor statistics of the present observation , we were unable to investigate further the nature of this line ; however , we note that the ratio between the normalizations of the @xmath52 and @xmath51 lines , as inferred from fits in table  [ tab : fit ] , is roughly in agreement with the expected value @xmath00.15 - 0.16 ( see e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most natural interpretation of this is that in state b the direct emission component is occulted along our line of sight , while the spectrum we observe is the sum of a dust scattered component , dominating at lower energies , and a wind scattered component characterised by a high absorption .",
    "the marked increase in the ew of the fe - line at @xmath06.5 across the state a - state b transition testifies that the region where the line is emitted is larger than the occulting body ( the supergiant companion , if we are dealing with an eclipse ) ; this provides strong evidence that the uneclipsed emission in state b at hard x - ray energies ( the @xmath30-slope power law ) arises mostly from photons scattered by the wind in the immediate surrounding of the source . in both states",
    "a and b the measured @xmath42 is consistent with the absorption column density reported by @xcite ; this provides further support in favour of the @xmath33-slope power law representing the outburst emission seen through a dust scattering halo with a delay of @xmath131  hour .",
    "these findings and interpretation are in line with those that emerged from detailed studies of some persistent eclipsing hmxbs .",
    "we obtained also spectral fit in which @xmath30 was allowed to vary as free parameters , while @xmath33=@xmath30 + 2 . however , this did not lead to a significant improvement of any of the fits , while the best fit parameters were consistent with the ones found above .",
