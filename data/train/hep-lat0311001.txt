    "there are two standard approaches in quantum theory : hamiltonian and lagrangian formulations .",
    "a comparison is given in tab.[tab1 ] .",
    "the lagrangian formulation is very suitable for applying the monte carlo ( mc ) method to systems with many degrees of freedom , and in the last two decades , it has been widely applied to lattice gauge theory@xcite . in the standard lagrangian mc method , however , it is extremely difficult to compute the spectrum and wave function beyond the ground state .",
    "wave functions in conjunction with the energy spectrum contain more physical information than the energy spectrum alone .",
    "although lattice qcd simulations in the lagrangian formulation give good estimates of the hadron masses , one is yet far from a comprehensive understanding of hadrons .",
    "let us take as example a new type of hardrons made of gluons , the so - called glueballs .",
    "lattice qcd calculations @xcite predict the mass of the lightest glueball with quantum number @xmath0 , to be @xmath1 . experimentally , there are at least two candidates : @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". the investigation of the glueball production and decays can certainly provide additional important information for experimental determination of a glueball .",
    "therefore , it is important to be able to compute the glueball wave function .    a natural question is whether in lagrangian mc simulations one can construct an effective hamiltonian ? we have recently proposed a new approach@xcite ( named monte carlo hamiltonian method ) to investigate this problem .",
    "we start out from the action of the theory .",
    "we compute the transition matrix for all transitions using mc with importance sampling , where the states are taken from a basis in hilbert space . as a result",
    ", we find an effective hamiltonian , i.e. its spectrum and eigen states .",
    "a lot of models@xcite in quantum mechanics ( qm ) have been used to test the method .",
    "this method has also been applied to scalar field theories@xcite .",
    "although mc with importance sampling has been very successful for qm with many local potentials , it is very difficult for qm with inverse potentials , due to the singularity . in this paper , we propose effective potential and extrapolation method to solve the problem .",
    "the hydrogen system is used as an example .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sect.[sec : effective hamiltonian ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : matelem ] , the basic ideas of mc hamiltonian are reviewed . in sect .",
    "[ sec : error ] , we describe a method to analyze the errors of the spectrum and wave functions . in sect .",

    "let us discuss the construction of the effective hamiltonian in several steps @xcite .",
    "first , consider in quantum mechanics in 1-dim the motion of a single particle of mass @xmath4 under the influence of a local potential @xmath5 .",
    "its classical action is given by @xmath6 given the classical action , one can determine q.m .",
    "transition amplitudes . like in lagrangian lattice field theory",
    ", we use imaginary time in what follows .",
    "we consider the transition amplitude for some finite time @xmath7 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and for all combinations of positions @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 run over a finite discrete set of points @xmath13 located on the real axis .",
    "suppose these points are equidistantly distributed ( spacing @xmath14 ) over some interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the transition amplitudes are given by the ( euclidean ) path integral , @xmath16 \\exp [ - s_{e}[x]/\\hbar ] \\bigg |_{x_{j},0}^{x_{i},t } ,               \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the euclidean action .",
    "suppose for the moment that those transition amplitudes were known .",
    "from that one can construct an approximate , i.e. effective hamiltonian . note that the matrix @xmath18_{n \\times n}$ ] is a real , positive and hermitian matrix .",
    "it can be factorized into a unitary matrix @xmath19 and a real diagonal matrix @xmath20 , @xmath21 because the matrix @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of the full hamiltonian @xmath23 by @xmath24 the matices @xmath19 and @xmath25 have the following meaning ,",
    "@xmath26 i.e. , the @xmath27 eigenvector @xmath28 of the effective hamiltonian @xmath29 can be identified with the @xmath27 column of matrix @xmath30 and the energy eigenvalues @xmath31 of @xmath29 can be identified with the logarithm of the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath20 .",
    "this yields an effective hamiltonian , @xmath32 note that in the above we have been mathematically a bit sloppy .",
    "the states @xmath33 are not hilbert states .",
    "we have to replace @xmath33 by some  localized \" hilbert state .",
    "this can be done by introducing box states .",
    "we associate to each @xmath11 some box state @xmath34 , defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "when we use an equidistant distribution of @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath37 , we refer to the basis of box states as the regular basis .",
    "we compute the matrix element @xmath38 directly from the action via monte carlo with importance sampling .",
    "this is done by writing each transition matrix element as a ratio of two path integrals .",
    "this is done by splitting the action into a non - interacting part and an interacting part , @xmath39 this allows to express the transition amplitude by @xmath40 ~ \\exp [ - s_{v}[x]/\\hbar ] ~ \\exp [ -s_{0}[x]/\\hbar ] \\right|^{y , t}_{z,0 } } { \\left . \\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1 } } d y   \\int_{x_{j}}^{x_{j+1 } } d z \\int [ dx ] ~ \\exp [ -s_{0}[x]/\\hbar ] \\right|^{y , t}_{z,0 } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath41 is the weight factor and @xmath42 is the observable .",
    "@xmath43 stands for the transition amplitude of the noninteracting system , which is ( almost ) known analytically . for details",
    "see ref.@xcite . carrying out these steps",
    "allows to construct an effective hamiltonian , which has turned out to reproduce well low energy physics of a lot of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "from errors of the matrix elements @xmath44 in monte carlo simulations , one can obtain the errors of the eigen value @xmath45 and wave function @xmath46 of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "suppose @xmath23 is the hamiltonian of the theory , @xmath47 is a perturbation term induced by error in the simulation , then we have the following equation for the transition matrix element    @xmath48    which implies @xmath49 or @xmath50 according to perturbation theory , the first order correction to the eigen value and wave function is @xmath51 where @xmath52 eq . ( [ e3 ] ) gives an estimate of the wave function .",
    "the schrdinger equation of a hydrogen is @xmath53 where @xmath54 because of the spherical symmetry , the wave function can be factorized as @xmath55 and the radial wave function satisfies @xmath56 + \\left[v(r)+\\frac { l \\left(l+1\\right)\\hbar^{2}}{2mr^{2}}\\right]\\psi ( r)=e \\psi .",

    "this system has the following analytic result for the energy @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the principal quantum number and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 have been chosen .",
    "the ground state and first excited state radial wave functions are @xmath66    our purpose is to investigate the 1-d system not by solving eq .",
