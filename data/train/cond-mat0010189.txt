    "a jahn - teller ( jt ) polaron pairing effect was originally proposed as a possible explanation for the superconductivity in la@xmath1ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 by bednorz and mller@xcite . since",
    "then the jt effect has been discussed by a number of authors in different contexts@xcite and although many features have been observed experimentally supporting the general concept of jt  polarons @xcite , so far no generally applicable model has been shown to be compatible with the overall phenomenology observed in the cuprates .",
    "one of the major problems is that the single - ion jt energy splitting between cu @xmath4 states and d@xmath5 states is thought to be of the order of 1 ev or more , too large to play a role in the pseudogap physics , which is believed to be the energy scale of the pairing interaction , which is of the order of 0.1 ev .",
    "nevertheless , the observation of a large isotope effect on both @xmath6@xcite , @xmath7@xcite and penetration depth@xcite firmly establishes a role for lattice polarons in the pairing mechanism , while the fact that a depression in the spin susceptibility usually appears at a lower temperature than the  pseudogap  observed by charge excitation spectroscopies@xcite suggests that a lattice pairing mechanism is primary and the spin ordering follows .    in this paper",
    "we outline a new type of microscopic pairing scenario in la@xmath8sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 driven by a finite - wavevector jt instability .",
    "we find that the proposed model can explain many of the general features both in the underdoped and overdoped regions of the phase diagram and is fundamentally compatible with the overall phenomenology of the cuprates .",
    "the experimental observations on which the present scenario is based are mainly those showing evidence for the existence of dynamic incommensurate lattice distortions associated with doped holes .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , neutron pdf@xcite , exafs@xcite and esr@xcite experiments all show the existence of dynamic lattice distortions on timescales relevant for pairing of 10@xmath910@xmath10s .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering data@xcite can be singled out for _ directly _ giving not only the energy , but also the wavevector associated with the lattice distortion and its range in @xmath11-space without any interpretation or modeling .",
    "the observed distorted regions appear to be along the ( @xmath12 ) ( or ( @xmath13 ) ) directions , and have typical dimensions in real space of @xmath14 @xmath15  ) , where @xmath16 is the lattice constant . a shematic diagram of the distortion derived from an analysis of the data is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the energy of the anomaly of @xmath17 mev is of the order of the  pseudogap  energy , while its width of @xmath18 mev corresponds closely to the linewidth expected from the measured pair recombination rate , @xmath19 mev@xcite . at the doping level of @xmath20",
    ", the 2d volume of the object in figure 1 contains approximately 1.5 carriers .",
    "taken together , the implication is that the objects can be interpreted as @xmath11-space  snapshots  of individual pairs .",
    "additional experimental observations which we consider important in the present context is evidence for the co - existence of two carrier types in a large part of the phase diagram@xcite , and - in addition to the  pseudogap  - the appearance of a temperature - dependent superconducting gap @xmath21 which closes at @xmath6@xcite which is particularly well observed at higher doping levels and has a magnitude at @xmath22 of @xmath23 .",
    "before proceeding with the analysis of the _ e - p _ coupling for the case of general @xmath11 , let us briefly discuss the @xmath24 point coupling ( @xmath25 ) in the tetragonal group @xmath26 ( i4/mmm ) applicable to la@xmath1sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 the symmetrised cross product of the representations at the @xmath29 point is @xmath30=[e_{g}\\times e_{g}]=a_{1g}+b_{1g}+b_{2g},\\ ] ] which contains no degenerate representations .",
    "on the other hand , the lattice vibrations at the @xmath24point transform as : @xmath31 since there are no @xmath32 and @xmath33 representations at the @xmath34 point , electrons can couple only with @xmath35 phonon modes . in @xmath36",
    "there are two such modes associated with apex oxygens or la ions .",
    "however , the experiments show that the modes involved in the intraction are those of in - plane o atoms , which do not couple at the @xmath34 point .",
    "this leads us to the main conjecture of the proposed pairing model , namely the existence of _ intersite _ pairs which form via a @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the existence of intersite pairs in cuprate superconductors is inferred from their very short coherence length . given that the pair dimensions @xmath37 can not exceed the coherence length , i.e. @xmath38",
    ", we may infer that any possible lattice distortions associated with pairing have a finite range @xmath39 the effect of such lattice distortions should also be evident in reciprocal space , with an anomaly centered around a wavevector @xmath40 . following the inelastic neutron scattering data @xcite which shows an anomaly approximately at @xmath41 $ ] extending over almost half the brillouin zone ( bz ) @xmath42 we can write the electron - phonon interaction for such an object in the form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant describing the strength of coupling , @xmath45defines the wavevector associated with the interaction and its range in @xmath11-space , which - neglecting fluctuations - also defines its extent in real space ( inter - hole spacing ) as @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 defines its width in @xmath11-space and gives the width of the distribution of inter - carrier distances within the interacting pair .",
    "this is related to the average size of the deformation of each particle in real space @xmath48 .",
    "we now proceed with an analysis of the @xmath49 coupling using group theory for @xmath50intersite pairing and first discuss the relevant phonon modes .",
    "the bz corresponding to the tetragonal space group @xmath26 applicable for la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 is shown in figure 2 . to consider local pairs and/or stripes forming along the cu - o bond direction or along 45@xmath51 to it , we need to consider the general wavevector @xmath52 and the @xmath53 points , corresponding to the ( @xmath54 and ( @xmath55 directions respectively .",
    "( the special symmetry points ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 etc . ) give rise to commensurate distortions which will be discussed later . )",
    "the relevant lattice deformation associated with the neutron mode at 75 mev @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) is of @xmath58 - symmetry , where @xmath58 is the irreducible representation of the little group corresponding to the @xmath59 direction in the bz as shown in figure 3 . since in principle",
    "all modes of @xmath58 symmetry can couple to electrons , for completeness we show all the possible modes with @xmath58 symmetry in figure 3 .",
    "however , the most relevant mode - i.e. the one for which the anomaly is observed to be most pronounced - involves in - plane o1 displacements along the cu - o bonds ( see also fig.1 ) .",
    "since the @xmath52 point has a four pronged star in @xmath36 , the coupling of electrons in single non - degenerate electronic states to @xmath0 phonons can be written as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the site label , and @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the 4 wavevectors corresponding to the prongs of the star associated with the interaction .",
    "the nondegenerate electronic states in this interaction allowed by symmetry are associated with @xmath65-orbitals of planar oxygens , and transform as @xmath66 or @xmath67 representations of the @xmath36 symmetry group .",
    "however , the hamiltonian ( 3 ) above on its own does not lead to symmetry breaking , and thus is not of direct relevance for pair or stripe formation .",
    "a more interesting case arises when two - fold degenerate levels ( for example the two @xmath68 states corresponding to the planar o @xmath69 and @xmath70 orbitals or the @xmath68 and @xmath71 states of the apical o ) interact with @xmath72 phonons .",
    "we are particularly interested in the phonons which lead to symmetry breaking and allow the formation of intersite pairs or stripes . in eq .",
    "( 5 ) we give the invariant hamiltonian which couples degenerate electronic states to phonons transforming as the @xmath58 representations of the group of wave - vector @xmath73 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath71 and @xmath74 representations are real and pauli matrices @xmath75 corresponding to the doublet of @xmath71 or @xmath68 transform as @xmath35 ( @xmath76 ) for @xmath77 , @xmath32 ( @xmath78 ) for @xmath79 , @xmath33 ( @xmath80 ) for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 )  for @xmath84representations respectively , an invariant hamiltonian is given by : @xmath85 where @xmath86    the first term in ( 5 ) describes symmetric coupling and is identical to the non - degenerate case ( eq .",
    "the second and third terms describe the e - p interaction corresponding to the @xmath52 and @xmath53 directions respectively , while the last term describes the _ coupling to spins_@xcite .",
    "the proposed interaction ( 5 ) on its own results in a splitting of the degenerate states , breaking the tetragonal symmetry and resulting in a local orthorhombic distortion at @xmath64 extending over @xmath87 in @xmath11-space .",
    "it can therefore lead to the formation of bound intersite pairs and/or stripes with no further interactions .",
    "of course the stability and size of such a distortion will be determined by the balance of short - range attraction , long - range coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss the properties of the system governed by this hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "the importance of the different terms is of course to be determined by experiments .",
    "for example , the large 20% anomaly in inelastic neutron scattering at the @xmath52 point clearly emphasizes the second ( @xmath88-wave ) term , while the absence of strong anomalies at @xmath25 de - emphasizes the symmetric ( @xmath89-wave ) term and so the new ground state is expected to be a pair which extends over a few unit cells along the cu - o bond direction @xmath90 or @xmath91.@xcite the internal lattice structure within the pair is distorted , so pairing would be associated with a reduced _ local _ symmetry within the pair .",
    "in other words , the tetragonal or pseudo - tetragonal symmetry of the crystal is broken locally by the formation of a non - local jt pair with a binding energy @xmath92 given by the solution to the hamiltonian ( 5 ) .",
    "we thus associate the pairing energy gap @xmath93 with the experimental observation of a  pseudogap  at @xmath94@xcite .    to understand these finite - wavevector jt pairs in the context of the phase diagram of the cuprates",
    ", we consider the effect of thermal fluctuations as the temperature is reduced through @xmath7 in the underdoped phase ( fig .",
    "4 ) . for @xmath95 thermal energy",
    "prevents the carriers from forming pairs at all levels of doping ( shown schematically in the top row in figure 5 ) . approaching @xmath96",
    "jt  pairs start to form and exist in equilibrium with unbound carriers according to chemical balance at thermodynamic equilibrium@xmath97,$ ] and shown schematically in the lower panel of fig .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath98 which is observed to approximately follow an inverse law @xmath99 @xcite is suggested to be a result of screening as discussed by alexandrov , kabanov and mott@xcite , and will not be discussed further here . )    for such non - local pairs to be stable , the energy gained by the jt pairing must counteract the coulomb repulsion between two charge carriers within the pair @xmath100 .",
    "the _ upper limit _ for the coulumb repulsion between two carriers approximately one coherence length apart is given by @xmath101 @xmath102 ev ( taking @xmath103 nm @xmath104 and @xmath105@xcite ) .",
    "however , since @xmath106 in the relevant frequency range for pairing ( 1 - 4 thz)@xcite , the relevant value of @xmath107 can be significantly smaller and can be easily overcome by @xmath93 .",
    "once pre - formed bosonic pairs exist , superconductivity can occur when phase fluctuations between these pairs are sufficiently reduced so that phase coherence can be established between them .",
    "this can occur by bose condensation @xcite or some form of the kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite . in both cases the critical transition temperature in the underdoped region of the phase diagram",
    "is given by an expression relating @xmath6 to the pair density @xmath108  and effective mass @xmath109 : @xmath110 where @xmath111  is the dimensionality of the system@xcite .",
    "an important issue related to whether bose condensation occurs or another mechanism is responsible for the formation of the condensate formation is the number of pairs per coherence volume @xmath112 . using the experimental upper limit of coherence length in la@xmath113s@xmath114cuo@xmath3 at @xmath22 of @xmath115   and assuming for the moment a uniform carrier density in the cu - o planes , then at a carrier concentration of @xmath20 there are approximately 1.5 _ pairs per coherence volume_. considering the experimental error and uncertainties in geometrical factors involved in determining @xmath116 , it is clear that a crossover seems to occur near optimum doping from @xmath117 per @xmath112 to @xmath118 per @xmath119 implying a crossover from a bose - condensation to overlapping - pair superconductivity scenario@xcite .",
    "importantly , both are consistent with the finite - wavevector non - local jt - pairing interaction described here .",
    "( the detailed mechanism for the formation of a phase - coherent condensate is not the subject of the present paper and will not be discussed further here . )",
    "so far , the discussion concerned a intersite pairing - jt effect with two particles involved .",
    "if more than two _  _ particles are involved in the interaction , the effect of ( 5 ) is similar and provided @xmath120 ( eq .",
    "1 ) , a jt  distortion can occur along a stripe , for example .",
    "the internal _ lattice _ structure of such stripes is defined by the jt  lattice distortion , just as for pairs .",
    "the shape of these objects is determined primarily by minimisation of the coulomb energy , and the formation of 1d stripes is clearly more favourable than 2d clusters in this respect@xcite .",
    "the incommensurability of the dynamic jt distortion given by @xmath121 means that the number of sites in the stripe is larger than the number of carriers , resulting in a partially filled ground state .",
    "the electronic wavefunction inside such stripes is _ extended _ , that is , it extends throughout the entire stripe , and the macroscopic transport properties in the normal state are thus expected to be dominated by hopping or tunneling of carries _ between _ the stripes , rather than within them .",
    "the elementary excitations of such objects are expected to be fermionic and metallic in character , which makes their statistics different than for the jt pairs , which are bosons .",
    "the jt  stripes are expected to _ coexist _ both with jt pairs _ and _ unbound particles , with their relative populations determined by chemical balance and the pair binding energy @xmath122 compared to the stripe formation energy . a schematic real - space  snapshot  picture of this phase is shown in figure 5c ) .",
    "note that because we have a four - pronged star for the @xmath123point distortions , four different types of stripes can form , each corresponding to one of the four @xmath121 . since the little group at the  @xmath123point does not have inversion symmetry",
    ", the stripes can have a local polarisation ( i.e have a ferroelectric phase ) .",
    "this may explain the presence of a spontaneous polarisation in these materials and the appearance of a pyroelectric effect in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3@xcite and other cuprates@xcite .",
    "a most simple and appealing possibility is that superconductivity in the presence of stripes still occurs via the same pre - formed pair scenario as discussed in the previous section .",
    "however , the stripes then appear to have a detrimental effect on superconductivity , because they take up carriers and thus reduce the number of pairs .",
    "as the density of doped holes increases with increasing doping , the spacing between them becomes comparable to the pair size and they start to overlap , so interactions between the pairs and stripes become important , and some kind of collective or cooperative effect which extends over both types of objects needs to be considered .    the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 5 ) introduces a number of length scales ( see fig .",
    "the first is the mean distance between the charge carriers in the pair ( or within the stripe ) @xmath124 .",
    "the second is the length of the stripes @xmath125 and finally , there is the length scale @xmath126 describing the characteristic distance _ between _ the pairs or stripes , which is determined simply by the carrier density .",
    "with increasing doping , the distance between the pairs and stripes @xmath126 decreases and increased screening reduces coulomb repulsion , which in turn leads to increased stripe length @xmath125 . at some point @xmath126 becomes comparable to the superconducting coherence length @xmath127 , and the superconducting pairs become _ proximity coupled _ to the metallic stripes ( fig .",
    "5c ) . in other words ,",
    "superconductivity in the stripes will be induced below @xmath6 by a jt pair - gap proximity effect . above @xmath6 , there is no proximity coupling and so clearly the superconducting order parameter must be zero in the stripes .",
    "thus it is evident that the superconducting order parameter has to be @xmath128-dependent within the stripes . whence an explanation for the experimentally observed _ coexistence _ of a @xmath128-independent pairing gap (  pseudogap  ) @xmath93 and a @xmath128-dependent superconducting gap @xmath129 @xcite for which @xmath130    the proposed model suggests a simple explanation why @xmath6 _ decreases _ in the overdoped regime . with increased doping , the stripe length @xmath125 increases leading to increased overall metallicity , while at the same time _",
    "the number of pairs decreases _ , leading to a decrease in @xmath6 according to the formula given by eq .",
    "eventually in the metallic , nonsuperconducting phase , @xmath131 and the material becomes a homogeneous metal with no pairs and hence the phase no longer supports high - temperature superconductivity .    above @xmath7 the crossover from the underdoped to",
    "the overdoped phase manifests itself in a change of non - degenerate to degenerate statistics as indicated by region 1 and region 2 respectively in the phase diagram in fig.4 . in principle",
    "they should be distinguishable from the temperature dependence of the susceptibility for example , which should be curie - like in region 1 and pauli - like in region 2 , particularly at low temperatures ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "in contrast , the crossover from region 1 to 3 ( fig .",
    "4 ) is governed by excitations across the pseudogap with the temperature dependence of the susceptibility given by @xmath132 $ ] @xcite .",
    "an important issue which needs to be discussed is the effective mass of the non - local jt pairs coupled by @xmath0 wavector phonons .",
    "let us consider - for simplicity - only the most experimentally relevant interaction for @xmath59 -point coupling , i.e. the ( @xmath133 term of the hamiltonian eq.(5 ) .",
    "in this case we can apply the lang - firsov@xcite transformation which will give an appropriate estimate of the particle mass @xcite . in that case",

    "when compared with the similar expression for the effective mass in the holstein model which has no @xmath11-depedence , we find that the effective mass exponent is a factor 2 smaller than the corresponding expression in the holstein ( bi)polaron@xcite . if @xmath142 the effective mass becomes even smaller , reflecting the fact that for forward scattering the electron - phonon interaction does not increase the mass strongly . indeed for @xmath143 ,",
    "the effective mass approaches the bare electron mass @xmath144 @xmath135 .",
    "this effect is similar to that discussed by alexandrov for the case of the froehlich interaction@xcite .",
    "however , note that in this case the interaction is weak and there is no pair binding at all for @xmath25 , which means that it is not relevant if we are considering pairing , but _ is _ relevant if we consider single - electron transport in the normal state . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath145 the mass enhancement becomes more pronounced because of strong backscattering , and so at the zone boundary , corresponding to the special points @xmath146 and @xmath147 in the bz , we expect a very large coupling and a strongly enhanced pair mass",
    ". this situation would be relevant to a zone - doubling ( for the @xmath147-point ) or quadrupling ( for the @xmath146-point ) charge density wave formation and/or the formation of long - range order associated with a structural phase transition . the case _",
    "relevant for pairing _ is of course intermediate , as indicated by the wavevector @xmath64 in the neutron experiments .    as already discussed , according to the neutron data the interaction in the cuprates appears to take place over a large range of wavevectors @xmath87 centered near @xmath148 .",
    "an interesting case arises at the 1/8 doping level , where the interparticle distance @xmath149 .",
    "if @xmath150 corresponds exactly to @xmath151 we expect to observe a cdw  with a periodicity given by @xmath64 .",
    "( note that this is different to the simpler case of a zone - boundary cdw  discussed in the previous paragraph . )    in the underdoped state the jt model is different from the bipolaronic ( bp ) models@xcite and other intersite models@xcite primarily with regard to the detailed mechanism of bipolaron formation .",
    "whereas the standard bipolaron model usually refers to quantum - chemical calculations@xcite and does not necessarily involve a particular jt mode , nor a specific local symmetry change upon pairing , the present intersite jt  pairing model does so , and implies a very specific hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) which is based on the symmetry analysis of experimentally determined local distortions .",
    "( 2 ) at first sight has some common features with the phenomenology of the charge - density wave ( cdw ) scenario @xcite .",
    "the present model offers a microscopic description for the origin of this interaction as arising from jt - coupling between a @xmath152 mode and degenerate electronic states .",
    "the proposed scenario suggests the coexistence of fermionic excitations in stripes and bosons ( pairs ) over the entire phase diagram in different proportion determined by thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this appears to be born out by the susceptibility data@xcite and the 2-component interpretation of the optical conductivity @xcite amongst others @xcite .",
    "it can also be shown to be consistent with the temperature and doping dependence of angle - resolved photoemission spectra .",
    "a pairing jt deformation at the @xmath52 point leads to objects which have finite dimensions along the @xmath16 or @xmath153 crystal axes .",
    "we therefore expect to observe features associated with these objects in @xmath11-space along the @xmath52 direction ( i.e. along @xmath154 and the appearance of a  pseudogap  in  the arpes spectra .",
    "the range of wavevectors where such a  pseudogap  appears is given by @xmath155 from eq .",
    "the metallic stripes on the other hand , in which fermionic excitations exist in the normal state , above @xmath156 we expect to observe a band which crosses the fermi - level along the @xmath59 direction .",
    "importantly , with increased carrier concentration , the increased _ coupling between pairs and stripes _ leads to increased 2d order , progressively extending the fermi surface in the overdoped state .",
    "clearly , the temperature - dependent superconducting gap @xmath129 which forms in the stripes will appear in the same regions in @xmath11-space as the fermionic band . if we assume that the model can be extended to bi@xmath137sr@xmath137cacu@xmath137o@xmath157 , the coexistence of a @xmath128-dependent  superconducting  gap and a  pseudogap  along @xmath158  ( i.e. the @xmath59 direction : see fig .",
    "2 ) , and especially the apparent  destruction of the fermi surface  with underdoping @xcite can be understood to be consequences of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) .    reconciling the slight differences in the interpretation of the observed lattice distortions in esr , exafs and inelastic neutron scattering , the @xmath159 point symmetry analysis of ionic displacements in la@xmath1sr@xmath160cuo@xmath3 shows that the distortion of @xmath161 symmetry at the zone boundary which was invoked to explain the esr@xcite and exafs @xcite ( figure 6 ) is in fact the zone - boundary ( i.e. short - range ) equivalent to the @xmath58 distortion occuring over a more extended length scale along the @xmath52 direction in the bz and the experiments may be detecting the same mode described by eq .",
    "we end the discussion by noting that the choice of @xmath64 made on the basis of neutron data also determines the symmetry of the pairing channel in eq.5 .",
    "the first term is isotropic ( @xmath89-wave ) while the second one has @xmath88-wave symmetry along the cu - o bond axes .",
    "the relative strengths of the terms are of course to be determined by experiments , but the large phonon anomaly at the @xmath52 point in the inelastic neutron data clearly emphasizes the @xmath88-wave component .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to identify an interaction which can lead to pairing in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 on the basis of a symmetry analysis of the experimentally observed anomalies in the @xmath0 phonon spectrum .",
    "it essentially describes the interaction which causes the microscopic inhomogeneities observed in experiments .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the implications for superconductivity and the phase diagram .",
    "the non - local jahn - teller pairing interaction which couples @xmath162 modes at the @xmath52 point with degenerate in - plane o @xmath69 and @xmath70 states is in spirit , if not in detail similar to the motivation described in the original paper on la@xmath1ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 by bednorz and muller@xcite .",
    "the pseudogap in the normal state results from pair density fluctuations and the temperature @xmath7 represents an energy scale for the pairing @xmath163 @xmath164 mev for la@xmath8sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 .",
    "the model naturally leads to the formation of stripes and the cross - over from a predominantly paired ( bosonic ) normal state to a mixed fermion - boson system in the overdoped region . a straightforward and appealing way to explain the doping dependence of @xmath6 in the overdoped regime by eq .",
    "( 8) arises from the fact that at higher doping levels the average stripe lengths increase and thus _ the number of pairs is reduced , _ thus reducing @xmath6 .",
    "apart from giving rise to a rather simple phase diagram which is consistent with experimental observations , the model also answers the question why superconductivity often appears near an orthorhombic phase of the material .",
    "however , because the pairs are dynamic and incommensurate , the locally orthorhombic phase associated with the jt - pair can not be easily detected by time- and spatially- averaging experimental techniques , and one does _ not _ expect to observe a static orthorhombic phase below @xmath7 . on the other hand , the model can explain well the inelastic neutron scattering , neutron pdf , exafs , arpes , susceptibility and esr , as well others@xcite which we have not discussed here .",
    "while here we have mainly focussed on la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , we note that similar large @xmath0 lattice distortions have been reported in yba@xmath165cu@xmath166o@xmath167@xcite and we expect a similar mechanism to work there also , as well as the other cuprates and oxides in general where mesoscopic inhomogeneities are observed .",
    "we have also omitted a discussion of the spin coupling associated with the local pairs given by the last term in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , but mention only that in contrast to the holstein model , the present hamiltonian allows the formation of spin singlet _ or _",
    "triplet pairs@xcite .",
    "finally we might add as a general comment that a short superconducting coherence length of the order of the inter - carrier spacing may be an indication that carriers are paired by a finite - wavevector jt instability forming non - local pairs .",
    "apart from the cuprates , alkali doped fullerenes might be an example of such a case .",
