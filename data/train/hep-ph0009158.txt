    "some extensions of the standard model ( sm ) exhibit higgs bosons which can decay into stable neutral weakly interacting particles , therefore giving rise to invisible final states . in supersymmetric models",
    "the higgs bosons can decay with a large branching ratio into lightest neutralinos or gravitinos in some region of the parameter space @xcite , leading to an invisible final state if @xmath4 parity is conserved .",
    "invisible higgs decays also happen in models with an enlarged symmetry breaking sector , _",
    "e.g. _ in majoron models @xcite , where the higgs disintegrates into light weakly interacting scalars . in the scenario of large extra dimensions , proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite , it is possible that the higgs boson mixes with scalar fields arising from gravity propagating in extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "this mixing can lead to a sizeable invisible width for the higgs .",
    "certainly the presence of invisible decays modifies considerably the higgs boson searches , making it much more difficult . at @xmath5",
    "colliders the problem is not very severe , and it has been shown that the higgs parameter space can be probed completely @xcite .",
    "presently , the lep ii collaborations exclude invisible higgs masses up to 106.7 gev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs search at hadron colliders is much more difficult in the presence of such invisible decays .",
    "previous studies have analyzed @xmath6 and @xmath7 associated production@xcite and @xmath8 production@xcite as promising channels .",
    "considering statistical errors only and assuming that the higgs couplings are the sm ones and that the invisible branching ratio effectively is 100% , the associated @xmath6 production was estimated to be sensitive to higgs masses",
    "@xmath9 gev @xcite at the cern lhc while @xmath8 production might extend the higgs mass range to 250 gev @xcite .",
    "both searches must deal with signal cross sections in the few fb range or below , however , and detector resolution and background normalization errors become crucial because signal and background distributions have virtually identical shapes after cuts .    in this work",
    "we show that the lhc s potential to unravel the existence of invisibly decaying higgs bosons can be considerably extended by studying higgs production via weak boson fusion .",
    "weak boson fusion ( wbf ) is a copious source of higgs bosons at the lhc , yielding signal cross sections , after cuts , of order 100 fb , as we shall see .",
    "furthermore , the presence of very energetic forward jets in the signal , with characteristic azimuthal angle correlations , allows us to tag the higgs events and to efficiently suppress the backgrounds .",
    "it has been shown that wbf is among the most promising search channels in the 120200 gev higgs mass range .",
    "it is possible to observe an intermediate mass higgs boson through its decays @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , and even @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "here we extend this list to include otherwise invisible decay modes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the techniques used to evaluate the relevant cross sections , while section iii contains the main characteristics of the signal and backgrounds and the cuts chosen to enhance the invisible higgs signal . in section  iv , we present a detailed discussion of how to use data to predict the exact background normalization . our results and conclusions are presented in section v.",
    "we are considering the production of higgs bosons in wbf , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , with subsequent decay to undetectable particles .",
    "the signal is thus characterized by two quark jets , which typically enter in the forward and backward regions of the detector and are widely separated in pseudorapidity , and by a large transverse momentum imbalance , due to the higgs invisible decay products .",
    "significant backgrounds can arise from any processes leading to two jets and missing transverse momentum , such as @xmath0 production with subsequent decay @xmath16 or @xmath1 production with @xmath17 decay where the charged lepton is not identified .",
    "another source are qcd dijet and multijet events with large missing transverse momentum generated by energy mismeasurements or from high @xmath18 particles escaping through the beam - hole .",
    "these purely qcd processes possess a potentially very large cross section . in mismeasured two jet events , the missing @xmath18 points in the direction of the jets and we use this fact to suppress this background .",
    "however , this is not true for the production of 3 or more jets and we include this qcd @xmath19 background in our analysis .",
    "the signal and backgrounds are simulated at the parton level with full tree level matrix elements .",
    "this was accomplished by numerically evaluating helicity amplitudes for all subprocesses .",
    "backgrounds include all order @xmath20 real emission corrections to drell - yan production ( to be called qcd @xmath1 and @xmath0 processes ) and cross sections are calculated with code based on ref .",
    "the second large class of processes are the signal and the electroweak background , ew @xmath1 and @xmath0 production , with contributions from the @xmath21-channel exchange of an electroweak boson off which the final state @xmath22 , @xmath15 or higgs is radiated .",
    "the code for these processes is based on ref .",
    "@xcite , and was checked with matrix elements generated using the package madgraph @xcite .",
    "madgraph code was also used to simulate the qcd @xmath19 background at tree level .",
    "for all qcd effects , the running of the strong coupling constant is evaluated at one - loop order , with @xmath23 .",
    "we employed cteq4l parton distribution functions @xcite throughout .",
    "the factorization scale was chosen as @xmath24 min(@xmath18 ) of the defined jets .",
    "we took the electroweak parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 gev , and @xmath28 gev , which was obtained imposing the tree level relation @xmath29 .",
    "for the qcd @xmath19 background , for which detector effects produce the missing @xmath18 , we simulate experimental resolutions by smearing the energies ( but not directions ) of all final state partons with a gaussian error given by @xmath30 ( @xmath31 in gev ) .",
    "@xmath32 decays in @xmath1 events lead to a @xmath33 signature when the charged lepton @xmath34 is not identified .",
    "a precise modeling of this background requires a full detector simulation .",
    "we estimate the @xmath1 backgrounds by assuming that in the central region , @xmath35 , all muons , electrons and taus with @xmath36  gev , respectively , can be vetoed , while any charged leptons below these thresholds will be misidentified and counted in the @xmath18 balance only . in the forward regions , @xmath37 , a lepton veto is taken to be impossible . here , muons are assumed to give no @xmath18 deposit in the calorimeters , in contrast to electrons and taus whose entire energy is recorded .",
    "note that the resulting @xmath1 background , within jet cuts given below , is about half the event rate of all @xmath38 events with @xmath39  gev , i.e. we are certain not to seriously underestimate the @xmath1 background .    an important feature of the wbf signal is the absence of color exchange between the final state quarks , which leads to a depletion of gluon emission in the region between the two tagging jets .",
    "we can enhance the signal to background ratio by vetoing additional soft jet activity in the central region @xcite .",
    "a central jet veto is ineffective against the ew @xmath1 and @xmath0 backgrounds which possess the same color structure as the signal . for the qcd backgrounds ,",
    "however , there is color exchange in the @xmath21-channel and consequently a more abundant production of soft jets , with @xmath40  gev , in the central region @xcite .",
    "the probability of an event to survive such a central jet veto has been analyzed for various processes in ref .",
    "@xcite , from which we take the veto survival probabilities of table  [ surv ] which are appropriate for the hard tagging jet cuts to be used below .",
    "the cross section for higgs boson production via wbf is well known within the framework of the sm .",
    "we should keep in mind that this production cross section might be diluted in extensions of the sm .",
    "for instance , it is suppressed by factors @xmath41 or @xmath42 in supersymmetric models . any suppression in the production cross section",
    "has the same effect , for our study , as a branching ratio of invisible higgs decays below unity , and we will not separate these effects in the following .",
    "the main features of the production of an invisible higgs boson via wbf are the presence of two very energetic forward jets as well as a large missing transverse momentum .",
    "therefore , we initially impose the following jet tagging cuts and missing momentum cut @xmath43 a further reduction of the backgrounds , with good signal efficiency , is achieved by requiring a large invariant mass , @xmath44 , of the two tagging jets , @xmath45 and by selecting events where the azimuthal angle between the tagging jets , @xmath46 ( measured in radians ) is relatively small , @xmath47    in order to motivate our choice of the @xmath48 cut , we display , in fig .",
    "[ dist : et ] , the @xmath48 spectrum after the cuts ( [ cuts1 ] ) and ( [ cuts2 ] ) , but without a central jet veto .",
    "the signal exhibits a peak around @xmath49 gev and it is much smaller than the backgrounds at small @xmath48 .",
    "missing @xmath18 generated by the qcd @xmath19 background falls rapidly and this background becomes negligible above @xmath50  gev .",
    "note that we require @xmath51 for the two tagging jets of the qcd jjj background , in order to avoid the soft singularities present near @xmath52 .",
    "well above @xmath49  gev , the missing @xmath18 spectra of the signal and the @xmath0 backgrounds have the same slope .",
    "hence , a tightening of the @xmath48 cut soon becomes useless .",
    "the qcd backgrounds involve initial and final state gluons which tend to be softer than the quarks in wbf . in fig .",
    "[ dist : mjj ] , this is reflected by the steeper falloff of the qcd backgrounds as @xmath44 , the dijet invariant mass , is increased .",
    "the @xmath53 gev requirement reduces these backgrounds sufficiently . note that no central jet veto is included in fig .",
    "[ dist : mjj ] . a further improvement of the signal to background ratio is possible by tightening the @xmath44 cut , but this will not be pursued in the following .",
    "the most distinct remaining difference between the higgs signal and all backgrounds is the azimuthal angle correlation of the two tagging jets .",
    "the @xmath46 distributions within the cuts ( [ cuts1]-[cuts2 ] ) and including the central jet veto efficiencies of table  [ surv ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ dist : phijj ] .",
    "the @xmath54 coupling of the higgs boson in wbf favors higgs emission opposite to both tagging jets , which leads to small values of @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0 backgrounds , on the other hand , are smallest in this region and prefer back to back jets .",
    "the distinct shape difference of the @xmath46 distributions provides very powerful tools to probe for a higgs contribution , either by a full shape analysis or by the @xmath55 cut of ( [ cuts3 ] ) .",
    "the effect of such a cut is presented in tables [ ev : bckg ] and [ ev : sig ] , where background and signal cross sections are given after imposing the cuts ( [ cuts1]-[cuts2 ] ) and ( [ cuts1]-[cuts3 ] ) . with an integrated luminosity of 10",
    "fb@xmath2 a total of 1670 background and of order 400 to 1000 signal events with @xmath55 are expected for an invisible branching fraction br@xmath56 , giving a highly significant signal when statistical errors only are considered .",
    "finding , or constraining , an invisibly decaying higgs boson signal in @xmath33 events is essentially a counting experiment since a resonance in the invariant mass distribution of the higgs decay products can not be extracted .",
    "the sensitivity of the search is thus determined by the precision with which the background rate in the search region can be predicted .",
    "since the signal selection is demanding , including double forward jet tagging and central jet vetoing techniques whose acceptance can not be calculated with sufficient precision in perturbative qcd , the background levels need to be determined directly from lhc data .",
    "fortunately , a sizable sample of @xmath57 events ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , with fully identified charged leptons from the @xmath58 decay , will be available within the hadronic acceptance cuts discussed above . for @xmath0 events with",
    "two identified charged leptons , the @xmath59  gev cut is equivalent to @xmath60  gev and the only difference to the @xmath61 background is due to minimal charged lepton @xmath18 and rapidity cuts which are needed to insure their observability . the cross section for qcd and",
    "ew @xmath62 events ( @xmath63 ) , with @xmath64  gev , @xmath35 and within the cuts ( [ cuts1]-[cuts2 ] ) , including the central jet veto probabilities of table  [ surv ] , is about 87 fb , of which 16.6  fb are expected in the @xmath55 region .",
    "thus an effective luminosity of 10  fb@xmath2 is sufficient to measure the @xmath0 background in the two regions @xmath65 and @xmath55 with relative errors of 3.8% and 7.8% , respectively .",
    "the level of the @xmath1 background can be extracted from @xmath66 events , with hadronic cuts as given above and the additional requirements @xmath67  gev and @xmath68  gev , @xmath35 . the combined cross section for qcd and",
    "ew @xmath69 events , including central jet veto , is 184  fb ( 975  fb ) with ( without ) the @xmath55 requirement . with an effective luminosity of 10  fb@xmath2",
    "this translates into a statistical error of a mere 2.3% for the prediction of the total @xmath1 background within the cuts ( [ cuts1]-[cuts3 ] ) .",
    "central jet veto efficiencies will be almost identical for charged lepton and missing @xmath18 signatures of the decaying @xmath22s and @xmath15s .",
    "other systematic errors like luminosity uncertainties , jet reconstruction efficiencies , or knowledge of the fractional contributions from wbf and qcd production are also eliminated by obtaining the background normalization from the leptonic @xmath70 data .",
    "even trigger efficiencies can be determined directly from these events .",
    "the background normalization error can be further reduced by expanding the calibration region , at the price , however , of introducing a qcd uncertainty , due to the necessary extrapolation to the signal region . for the @xmath0 background in particular",
    ", one would like to use the entire @xmath46 region to determine the background normalization , since the data sample within ( [ cuts3 ] ) will be relatively small .",
    "these extrapolation uncertainties are small , as we will now show for the shape of the @xmath46 distribution .    at present",
    "we only have leading order ( lo ) calculations of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 qcd backgrounds available .",
    "due to the small difference in weak boson mass , as compared to _",
    "e.g. _ the large dijet mass required in our event selection , qcd corrections for these processes are expected to be very similar and we only analyze the shape of the @xmath46 distribution for the qcd @xmath0 background in the following . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale](a ) is @xmath71 for four different renormalization scale choices , @xmath72 ( dash - dotted line ) where @xmath73 is the squared parton center  of  mass energy , @xmath74 ( dashed line ) , the default choice @xmath75 ( solid line ) , and @xmath76 ( dotted curve ) .",
    "one finds that the normalization of the qcd background changes by up to a factor of 3 between these choices and another variation by a factor of 3 to 4 is obtained by changing individual renormalization scales between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "while the normalization of the qcd @xmath0 cross section changes drastically , the shape of the @xmath46 distribution is essentially unaffected . as a measure of shape changes we plot the fraction of events with @xmath55 , @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 , the scale factor for the four different renormalization scale choices @xmath81 listed above . the @xmath80 dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale](b ) is very small for individual choices of @xmath82 , smaller in fact , than the differences between the four basic scales @xmath82 .",
    "[ fig : scale](b ) indicates that @xmath83 at lo qcd , i.e. a scale uncertainty of at most 10% is found for the shape of the @xmath46 distribution , a very small qcd error indeed for a leading order calculation . while this error is still uncomfortably large for the actual determination of an invisible higgs contribution to @xmath33 events , a nlo calculation , which hopefully will be available by the time the experiment is performed , should push the qcd shape uncertainty to well below the 5% level .",
    "we assume a 5% qcd uncertainty on @xmath84 in the following .",
    "compared to this extrapolation from opposite side to same side dijet events , minimal changes in hadronic event properties are encountered when extrapolating from @xmath57 events with observed leptons , as discussed above , to the corresponding @xmath33 sample . hence qcd uncertainties for ratios like @xmath85 , within analog cuts , are expected to be small .",
    "indeed , an analysis of the scale uncertainties of these ratios , analogous to the one performed above for @xmath84 , points to lo qcd errors of @xmath86 or less for the @xmath1 ratios and 1 - 2% for the @xmath0 ratios . at nlo",
    "these qcd uncertainties should be entirely negligible and we do not consider them in the following .",
    "the previous discussion points to at least two methods for constraining , or discovering , an invisible higgs decay channel .",
    "the first uses the shape of the @xmath46 distribution only . with 10  fb@xmath2 already , the estimated 1670 background events in the @xmath55 region imply that @xmath84 in ( [ eq : r1 ] ) can be measured with a statistical error of 2.2% , which is already small compared to the systematic error of 5% due to qcd scale uncertainties .",
    "taking the expectations for an @xmath87  gev higgs boson as an example ( see table  iii ) , an invisible effective branching fraction @xmath88 would give rise to a modification @xmath89 in absence of a signal , a deviation of @xmath84 of more than 10.7% can be ruled out at 95% cl , which translates into an upper bound @xmath90 from shape information alone .",
    "clearly this bound is systematics dominated and can be improved if it can be shown that our estimate for the qcd scale uncertainty is too conservative .",
    "a much higher sensitivity is achieved by making use of charged lepton signatures for @xmath57 events , as discussed in the previous section . again assuming an integrated luminosity of 10  fb@xmath2 , the @xmath1 background can directly be determined from @xmath32 events in the region @xmath55 , with a statistical error of 2.3% .",
    "the number of @xmath0 events with @xmath91 , in this region , is still modest , which makes it worthwhile to combine the direct determination with an extrapolation of the @xmath92 cross section in the @xmath65 region , in spite of the 5% systematic uncertainty of @xmath84 . combining all errors in quadrature , the @xmath93 background in @xmath55",
    "can be predicted , directly from the data , with a 5.3% error .",
    "the combined background from @xmath1 and @xmath0 sources can thus be predicted with an accuracy of @xmath94 .",
    "combined with the expected statistical uncertainty of the 1670 background events , one finds that the higgs contribution can be measured with a @xmath95 error of @xmath96  fb , which , in absence of a signal , translates into a 95% cl bound of @xmath97 for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath2 the combined backgrounds can be obtained with a precision of 1.2% and the bound ( [ limit ] ) reduces to 4.8 fb .",
    "we present in table  [ res ] the invisible higgs branching ratio that can be probed at 95% cl as a function of @xmath98 . in the event",
    "that the invisible higgs production cross section is suppressed with respect to the sm , the limits in this table apply to the product of the invisible branching ratio times the suppression factor .",
    "we find that the wbf channel extends considerably the sensitivity for invisibly decaying higgs bosons , with respect to the @xmath6 and @xmath99 channels @xcite . with 10  fb@xmath2 ( 100  fb@xmath2 ) of data it is possible to discover these particles with masses up to 480  gev ( 770  gev ) , at the 5@xmath3 level , provided",
    "their invisible branching ratio is 1 .",
    "a disadvantage of the wbf process , as compared to @xmath6 and @xmath100 production , is the requirement of a more complicated trigger .",
    "the latter provide hard isolated leptons as effective trigger signatures while the wbf signal possesses a dijet and missing @xmath18 signature only .",
    "the two jets of the wbf signal are very hard and widely separated , however , which allows for the setup of a specific wbf trigger , with modest reliance on the higgs decay signature .",
    "the qcd dijet cross section for events with two jets of @xmath101  gev within @xmath102 , separated by @xmath103 , is about 2.3  ( 41 )  @xmath104b . requiring the presence of @xmath48 with more than 3 to 4@xmath3 significance ,",
    "a condition which is easily fulfilled by the signal events with their @xmath59  gev , will immediately lower these cross sections to the low nb level , _ i.e. _ to event rates of a few hz only at a luminosity of @xmath105@xmath106sec@xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the presence of isolated electrons , muons or photons , of modest @xmath18 , will allow for efficient triggers of @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 events in wbf  @xcite .",
    "we strongly urge the lhc detector collaborations to develop such triggers for a broad - based study of wbf processes .",
