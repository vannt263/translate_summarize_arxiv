    "@xmath3 formation in the ism ( interstellar medium ) is a fundamental process in astrophysics .",
    "the radiative association of two hydrogen atoms is a process too rare to be efficient because it involves forbidden roto - vibrational transitions , and gas - phase three - body reactions are rare in the diffuse ism to explain @xmath3 abundance .",
    "it has long been recognized that hydrogen recombination occurs on surfaces of dust grains , where the grains act as the third body in the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "( @xcite ) .    the critical physical steps in which interstellar grains act as catalysts for the @xmath3 synthesis are : sticking and accommodation of gas - phase atoms on the grain surface ; mobility of h adatoms to meet each other within their residence time on the cold grain ; and ejection of the newly formed molecule into the gas phase .",
    "the efficiency of these processes depends on the structure and the chemical activity of the grain surface , whether it is silicon - bearing ( silicates can be not very stable in uv radiation fields ) @xcite , carbonaceous ( carbon can possibly be distributed on silicon - bearing grain surfaces ) or icy ( @xcite ) . in the case of more chemically active surfaces , like carbonaceous ones , the possible presence of unsaturated bonds will increase the percentage of chemisorption events .",
    "the morphology of the surface should influence the sticking and tunneling processes ; it is reasonable to assume that sticking will be higher and diffusion length lower on amorphous than on crystalline surfaces .",
    "amorphous is the most probable structure for grains in space , as shown by observations ( @xcite )",
    ".    observed @xmath3 abundance in diffuse clouds can be explained if the formation rate @xmath5 on grains balances its destruction rate ; the canonical value of @xmath5 is @xmath6 ( @xcite ) ; on grain surfaces , the recombination rate can be described as @xmath7 where , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the number densities of hydrogen atoms and dust grains , respectively , and @xmath10 is their relative velocity .",
    "@xmath0 ( sticking coefficient ) is the probability that an atom hitting a dust grain remains on the surface , and @xmath1 is the probability that an atom , once on the surface , makes an encounter with another h atom and recombines with it . for a typical diffuse cloud environment , ( @xcite )",
    "it is assumed that , on average , @xmath11 .    from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", the complexity of the problem lies in the fact that , due to the quantum nature of the h atom , a quantum mechanical calculation has to be done on a realistic , heterogeneous surface resembling dust grains in ism .",
    "hollenbach and salpeter ( hs ) ( @xcite ) calculated @xmath0 using simple semiclassical method for the atom - surface interaction , and found @xmath0 to be between @xmath12 and 1 in most cases .",
    "leitch - devlin and williams ( @xcite ) used a quantum mechanical approach and assumed a perfect single crystal with energy loss due to single phonon excitations . their sticking coefficient increases with gas temperature , reaches a maximum at @xmath13 comparable with phonon energies and then decreases again .",
    "buch and zhang ( @xcite ) numerically evaluated the sticking of hydrogen atoms on a cluster ( amorphous in structure ) of water molecules .",
    "they obtained @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a parameter(@xmath16 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 )    in hs s calculation ( @xcite ) , the tunneling efficiency of adsorbed hydrogen was high enough to ensure a very fast scanning of virtually all possible adsorption sites on a grain surface in a fraction of the residence time of the adsorbed species . in their model , the grain surface has two adsorption sites for h , one weak ( @xmath20 ) and the other strong ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "if only one weak adsorption site is present , h atoms would nt spend enough time on the surface to meet other h atoms and they would evaporate in a time @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a typical time of a vibration of a h atom in an adsorption site .",
    "smoluchowski ( @xcite ) did a quantum mechanical calculation and found that @xmath17 would get trapped in the deepest sites of an amorphous surface after a few hops .",
    "his efficiency of @xmath3 production is several orders of magnitude smaller than hs s .",
    "pirronello and averna ( @xcite ) investigated the possibility that @xmath3 could be produced in dense clouds by cosmic rays bombardment of grain mantles . within the smoluchowsky s model",
    ", they found that the cosmic rays mechanism would be dominant over @xmath3 recombination on grains at 10 k.    although sticking has been extensively studied experimentally ( @xcite ) , it has been done in conditions and on surfaces of almost no astrophysical interest , except for the following studies .",
    "brackmann and fite ( @xcite ) measured a sticking probability of 0.2 on a @xmath3-free surface and 0.5 on top of a @xmath3 layer in the temperature range of 2.5 to 8 k. due to poor vacuum conditions of their apparatus , it is assumed that their surfaces were covered with thick cryodeposits of background gas .",
    "there have been even fewer determinations in the laboratory of the hydrogen recombination coefficient on surfaces and up to now in conditions of no astrophysical relevancy .",
    "schutte et al .",
    "( @xcite ) measured the h recombination on a surface of a bolometer at 3 k , a temperature significantly smaller than the one of interstellar grains ( 10 - 15 k ) .",
    "they found @xmath24 on a hypothetically @xmath3-free surface .",
    "other experiments ( @xcite ) measured recombination rates in situations where either the surface temperature or the kinetic energy of the h atoms were high . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath17 beam scattering experiments have shown that the interaction of _ low energy _ @xmath17 beams with single crystal graphite surfaces is rather weak ; the ground state is @xmath25 @xmath26 deep .",
    "( @xcite ) experiments of scattering of @xmath17 from graphite single crystals above @xmath27 k gave a sticking coefficient of less than 0.1 and negligibly small above 21 k. ( @xcite )    the experimental studies mentioned above , although gave interesting information about physical / chemical process at surfaces , did nt really address the question of measuring the hydrogen recombination rate on surfaces in situations which could be related to astronomical observations .",
    "our study attempts to address this need .    in this report",
    ", we present the results of a set of experiments to measure the recombination coefficient on the surface of an olivine slab ( a silicate rich in fe , mg , si and oxygen ) , an astrophysically relevant material , even if polycrystalline , as natural stones on earth are , and not amorphous , as required by observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "low kinetic energy of h beams , low fluxes , and low surface temperature have been used .",
    "the experiments were performed in an ultra - high vacuum apparatus consisting of a scattering chamber and of two triply differentially pumped beam lines ( see fig .",
    "each atomic beam is produced by rf dissociation of molecular hydrogen ( or deuterium ) in a water - cooled pyrex tube placed in a rf cavity .",
    "an eni power supply provides 100 - 150 watt of power to the cavities via a power splitter and impedance matching networks . by using @xmath17 and @xmath19 beams ,",
    "the recombination product ( @xmath28 ) can be formed only on the surface , and not in the beam source due to imperfect dissociation , as in the case when using only one beam .",
    "the dissociation rate is measured by the quadrupole mass spectrometer in the main chamber .",
    "the maximum dissociation rate is over 90 @xmath29 , but in most cases was lower , around 70 - 85 @xmath29 , and it remained constant during experimental runs .",
    "each beam is made by the expansion of a low pressure gas ( 0.1 - 0.2 torr ) into vacuum through a short aluminum capillary of 1 mm in diameter connected to a @xmath30 reservoir .",
    "the beams enter the scattering chamber through 3 mm collimators .",
    "the estimated solid angle is @xmath31 and the flux for h is @xmath32 atoms/@xmath33/sec . to obtain a lower flux ,",
    "a mechanical chopper with a duty cycle of @xmath34 was used .",
    "the @xmath17 beam hits the surface of the sample perpendicularly , while the @xmath19 beam hits it at 38 deg . from the normal .",
    "the sample is mounted on a copper sample holder that is in good thermal contact with a helitrans cold finger and its temperature is measured via two calibrated chromel / iron - gold thermocouples pressed against the top and bottom surfaces of the sample .",
    "the lowest temperature reached with the cold finger is @xmath35 ( top thermocouple ) .",
    "the sample can be heated by radiation and electron - beam bombardment with a heater placed in a small cavity of the sample holder just behind the sample .",
    "the incoming and reflected beams are detected by a differentially - pumped quadrupole mass spectrometer .",
    "most of the results reported here are for a sample of olivine donated by dr .",
    "p. plescia of the cnr institute for the treatments of minerals ( rome ) .",
    "it consists of a mixture of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "prior insertion into the apparatus , the sample was cleaned with mild solvents ( acetone , methanol , freon ) in an ultrasonic bath .",
    "the sample was then placed on the sample holder in the uhv chamber and the apparatus was baked to 150 @xmath38c for a couple of days .",
    "the base pressure was in the mid @xmath39 torr range . in a typical experiment ,",
    "the sample is first heated to 200 @xmath38c for cleaning . after cooling ,",
    "it is exposed for a given amount of time to the @xmath17 and @xmath19 beams . during the adsorption time",
    ", the detector is placed in front of the sample and the mass is tuned to 3 ( i.e. , mass of @xmath28 .",
    "there is no other background gas contributing to the spectrometer signal at mass `` 3 '' ) . at the end of the exposure time",
    ", the sample temperature is quickly ( @xmath40 k / sec ) raised to over 30 k by shutting the he flow to the tip of the cryostat ; the amount of @xmath28 desorbed as a function of time is recorded into a multichannel scaler .",
    "a set of representative traces is shown in fig .",
    "an analysis of desorption kinetics is given elsewhere .",
    "( @xcite )    the background pressure of @xmath28 due to finite pumping capacity and/or recombination of @xmath17 and @xmath19 on the walls of the chamber is measured prior to and after each adsorption / desorption experiment , in front and back of the sample , and is subtracted from the recorded signal .",
    "we checked that after the blow - off of the @xmath28 layer there is no re - adsorption of @xmath28 from the gas phase .",
    "the sample holder is hugged by a copper radiation shield ; no adsorption / desorption of @xmath28 has been detected on / from the shield whose temperature is considerably higher than the sample .",
    "exposure times have been changed over several decades , see fig .",
    "3 , where the desorption yield ( which is the integral of curve in fig.2 ) is plotted vs. exposure to @xmath17 and @xmath19 .",
    "the data are fitted well by a langmuir adsorption kinetics .",
    "the saturation of the signal is interpreted as due to the completion of the first layer . the time it takes to form a @xmath28 layer is consistent with the calculated flux and a low ( @xmath41 ) sticking coefficient ( @xcite ) .",
    "4 shows the amount of @xmath28 desorbed following adsorption of @xmath17 and @xmath19 at various sample temperatures .",
    "the amount of @xmath28 produced and released _ during _ the adsorption process ( as measured by the mass spectrometer ) is typically much smaller than the amount released in the thermal desorption run .",
    "this means that at low sample temperatures ( 5 - 7 k ) , @xmath17 sticks ( although with a sticking probability well below 1 ) and readily recombines ; because of the low temperature , just @xmath28 that has just formed remains on the surface . at higher sample temperatures ( 10 - 15 k )",
    ", @xmath17 does nt stay on the surface long enough to recombine , and the @xmath28 yield is much smaller .",
    "likely , only those @xmath17 atoms which became trapped in strong binding sites are retained at these temperatures ; @xmath28 is then produced at reduced rates because of slow diffusion of @xmath17 atoms out of these deeper energy sites .",
    "we could nt measure the @xmath17 signal during adsorption / desorption in a quantitative way because of the presence of background of @xmath17 in a stainless steel system ( even at 5 @xmath39 torr total base pressure ) .",
    "an analysis of desorption kinetics after adsorption of @xmath17 at high sample temperature could yield some valuable clues ; at present , however , the desorption signals are too low for a meaningful quantitative analysis .",
    "the recombination efficiency of @xmath28 , here defined as the fraction of @xmath17 atoms which stick and recombine to from @xmath28 - or @xmath42 , is calculated as follows ( note that this is different from the recombination rate @xmath5 defined earlier ) : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath28 signal during adsorption , @xmath45 is the total amount of @xmath46 desorbed after the adsorption process , and @xmath47 the the amount of h sent into the chamber .",
    "the signals are corrected for velocity - dependent detection efficiency and for the measured solid angle of the detector.@xmath48 is also corrected for the probability of forming @xmath28 into other reaction channels , and for the different measured intensities of the @xmath17 and @xmath19 beams . as mentioned before , only a small fraction of the amount of @xmath28 which desorbs in the thermal programmed desorption leaves the sample during the _ adsorption process_. consequently , the recombination efficiency drops with increasing surface temperature similarly to the fall off of the desorption yield as a function of temperature , see fig .",
    "the recombination efficiency was measured for different exposures to @xmath17 and @xmath19 , as seen in fig .",
    "other candidate materials for grains in the ism are : carbonaceous solids , both amorphous and crystalline , and icy mantles ( @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to investigate the formation of molecular hydrogen also on these other materials and we have already obtained some preliminar results ( to be published elsewhere ) for @xmath49 recombination on hopg ( highly oriented pyrolitic graphite ) .    our estimate of @xmath50 at 5 - 6 k is not far from schutte et al. s value obtained on a uncharacterized surface of a semiconductor bolometer but at considerably lower temperature ( 3k ) . at the astrophysically relevant grain temperature range of 10 - 15 k , our result , @xmath51 is noticeably lower than the value of hs s model ( @xcite ) , @xmath52 at 10 - 15 k.    we might try to speculate on the reason of this difference .",
    "calculations are for very idealized surfaces .",
    "there are a few assumptions that can influence the outcome of the calculation , such as the semiclassical description , the energetics of the binding sites , and the tunneling time between sites .",
    "the sample used by us presents a far more heterogeneous environment , both energetically and morphologically , than it has been considered in theoretical models . in a real surface",
    ", tunneling might proceed much more slowly , and the sticking coefficient for h on surfaces of olivine and graphite might be much different than previously calculated on model surfaces . considering that many models ( @xcite ) assume @xmath53 , and that a determination of @xmath0 for @xmath17 on graphite at @xmath54 gives @xmath55 ( @xcite ) ,",
    "it is conceivable that @xmath0 is only partially responsible for the fact that our @xmath56 is a factor 10 lower than hollenbach s , and that @xmath1 might be appreciably less than @xmath57 , contrary to what is most often assumed in models .",
    "what are the consequences of this determination of @xmath58 on the recombination rate @xmath5 giving the constraints posed by astronomical observations ? in order to reconcile our value for @xmath59 with the accepted value ( @xcite ) for @xmath5 ( @xmath40 to @xmath60 ) , we propose that the surface area of grains ( which , in a simple model , enters the expression for @xmath61 as a multiplicative factor ) might be larger ( by a factor 5 to 10 or even more for amorphous surfaces ) .",
    "this could be indeed the case if grains have a larger surface area ( i.e , they are ",
    "fluffier ) ( @xcite ) , than previously considered .",
    "this is not an unlikely scenario , considering the type of processing that grains are subjected to in the ism , and more theoretical and experimental effort should be devoted to verify it .",
