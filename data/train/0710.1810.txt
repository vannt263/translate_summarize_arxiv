    "linear optical quantum computing with photonic qubits has generated considerable interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "however , it has become clear that from a scaling perspective , some optical nonlinearity is extremely desirable .",
    "this can be achieved in a number of ways , either by using the coupling of photons with matter qubits @xcite , quantum zeno gates @xcite or by using optical nonlinearities @xcite . to date ,",
    "analysis of weak nonlinear optical gates has not taken into account self - phase modulation , mainly because the envisaged implementation is materials with an electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) .",
    "it is known that in such systems a large cross - phase modulation ( kerr nonlinearity ) can be achieved without any self - phase modulation @xcite . however ,",
    "in general nonlinear optical media self - phase modulation effects are present , and are typically of the order of half the cross - phase modulation .",
    "this is known as weak - wave retardation @xcite .    in this paper , we analyse the effects of self - phase modulation on the operation of the weak nonlinear optical parity gate , which was first introduced by barrett et al . @xcite . to this end , the classical and quantum theory of materials with third - order optical nonlinearities is reviewed , and we develop a description of the self - phase modulation of a coherent state in terms of its wigner function and the corresponding marginal probability distributions for the quadratures .",
    "we then give a modified , more realistic description of the parity gate , and show that a typical amount of self - phase modulation destroys the distinguishability between even and odd parity .",
    "we conclude that the nonlinearities in weak nonlinear optical parity gates must have negligable self - phase modulation .",
    "the original optical parity gate based on conditional phase shifts without self - phase modulation effects can be summarized as follows @xcite : two single - photon qubits each couple to an optical mode in a coherent state @xmath0 , such that a phase shift is induced in the coherent state whenever the qubit is in the logical state @xmath1 . moreover",
    ", the first qubit induces a controlled phase shift @xmath2 , while the second qubit induces a controlled phase shift @xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "[ easyas123 ] ) .",
    "the input state @xmath4 transforms into the output state @xmath5 if we assume that @xmath6 , then an @xmath7 quadrature measurement of the coherent state will project the qubit states either onto the even parity subspace ( @xmath8 ) , or onto the odd parity subspace @xmath9 . when the measurement outcome @xmath10 indicates projection onto the odd subspace , a known corrective phase shift @xmath11 must be applied .",
    "hence this is a deterministic parity gate that can be used to build cluster states @xcite , which are a universal resource for quantum computing .",
    "the requirements for this gate to work with sufficiently high fidelity is that @xmath12 , or @xmath13 . in the modified protocol of spiller et al . , @xcite the requirement becomes @xmath14 .",
    "this scaling is important in practical implementations , where we require @xmath15 to be reasonably small @xcite .",
    "the coherent state is often called the _ bus _ , and the conditional phase shifts are implemented with optically active materials such as kerr nonlinearities .     and @xmath3 on a coherent state @xmath0 , followed by an @xmath10-quadrature measurement induce a deterministic and nondestructive parity measurement .",
    "a corrective phase shift of @xmath11 must be applied when the measurement outcome @xmath10 indicates odd parity .",

    "the weak nonlinear optical parity gate for photonic qubits uses the optical kerr effect . in this section",
    "we review the classical and quantum theory of the third - order nonlinear interaction that leads to the kerr effect , and we present a convenient way to describe the kerr effect on coherent states using wigner functions .      a detailed review of the classical theory of the kerr effect can be found in boyd @xcite , and here we give a brief description of the relevant physics . for a lossless and dispersionless nonlinear medium , the optical response can be expressed as a power series in the electric field of the polarization field in the medium : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are multi - mode expansions of the polarization and electric field . here , we are particularly interested in the third order term @xmath19 .",
    "the polarizability and the electric fields are of course vector fields with three spatial components , and in general we should write @xmath20 the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath21 is then a fourth - rank tensor with 81 independent components .",
    "however , most materials are highly symmetric , and the actual number of independent components is far less . here",
    ", we take @xmath22 to be independent of the orientation of the fields , and treat the electric field and the polarization as scalar quantities .    the nonlinear medium required for the optical parity gate couples two modes , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with possibly different frequencies @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the frequencies may be identical , as long as the modes are distinguishable ( e.g. , they have different spatial directions ) .",
    "when we substitute this two - mode expansion of the electric field into eq .",
    "( [ eq : polarization ] ) and collect all terms that are proportional to @xmath27 , the third order of the polarization field consists of two terms , namely the _ cross - phase _ modulation ( xpm ) @xmath28 and the _ self - phase _ modulation ( spm ) @xmath29 here , we have suppressed the time dependence . in xpm , the polarization of mode @xmath23 depends on the intensity of the field in mode @xmath24 , while in spm the polarization in mode @xmath23 depends on the intensity in mode @xmath23 .",
    "notice the relative factor of two in the magnitude of the phase modulations .",
    "this means that for general isotropic nonlinear media the self - phase modulation is typically half the size of the cross - phase modulation .",

    "taking into account the third - order polarizability @xmath33 ( and assuming a vanishing second - order susceptibility ) we have for mode @xmath23 : @xmath34 in other words , there will be a phase shift in mode @xmath23 that is proportional not only to the regular phase shift ( @xmath35 ) , but also proportional to the intensity @xmath36 in mode @xmath23 and in mode @xmath24 .",
    "quantum mechanically , phase shifts are generated by the number operator of a given optical mode : @xmath37 when the phase shift of mode @xmath23 is proportional to the intensity of the field in mode @xmath24 , one would expect the phase shift generator @xmath38 to be multiplied by the number operator of mode @xmath24 .",

    "the original weak nonlinear parity gate as described above is invariant under spm . this is because the coupling constant for spm and xpm",

    "unfortunately , it is generally not possible to change the sign of the conditional phase shift .",
    "the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath22 is a material constant that can not readily be changed .",
    "using different materials with opposite nonlinearities seems highly impractical . in the case of eit ,",
    "the phase shift is proportional to the detuning of the qubit mode with the relevant transition in the eit medium .",
    "since both the frequency of the single photon and the transition frequency are fixed , it is not possible to switch the sign of the nonlinearity in the weak nonlinear parity gate .",

    "the variance is not affected by the rotation , and the distinguishability requirement is the same as in the original setup .    when the weak nonlinear parity gate is constructed with two identical conditional phase shifts , the spm no longer cancels , and instead of evaluating the expectation values of @xmath93",

    "this leads to @xmath103 , or @xmath104 note that we have evaluated @xmath105 with @xmath106 since the spm effect occurs _",
    "twice _ in the parity gate . we see that the value of @xmath94 changes dramatically , since it now depends on the magnitude @xmath107 of the coherent state in the bus mode ( @xmath94 will generally be a large multiple of @xmath108 ) .",

    "however , since the measurement outcome is known ( it is needed to determine the corrective phase shift ) , the state of the qubits remains pure .",

    "finally , we may salvage the weak nonlinear parity gate by employing quadrature squeezing of the bus mode after the effects of spm .",
    "the squeezing must be in the @xmath93 direction such that the peaks in the marginal probability distribution @xmath33 become narower .",
    "typically , when @xmath148 is the squeezing parameter , the variance is reduced by a factor @xmath149 and the resolution criterium becomes @xmath150 the down - side of using squeezing is that if @xmath148 is fairly large and @xmath94 is not chosen sufficiently accurate ( which , we have seen , is rather difficult ) , it may exacerbate the indistinguishability of the peaks .",
    "squeezing in the conjugate quadrature will result in an enhancement of the variance with a factor @xmath151 . in a rotated frame @xmath152",
    "the variance of a squeezed coherent state becomes @xmath153 if the use of squeezing is to outperform the setup without squeezing , the offset in the rotation angle must be smaller than @xmath154 .",
    "typically , weak nonlinear gates that do not propose to use eit materials involve a self - phase modulation of the bus mode . in typical nonlinear materials",
    "this effect is half the size of the cross - phase modulation .",
    "also , the cross - phase modulation ( and hence the self - phase modulation ) may not be easily switched in the course of operating the gate .",
    "this means that the gate must be redesigned to operate with two successive identical phase shifts . in this case",
    "the self - phase modulation no longer cancels , as it can not be switched in sign independently from the cross - phase modulation .    in this paper",
    ", it was shown that a typical self - phase modulation half the size of the cross - phase modulation will remove the distinguishability of the two parity measurement outcomes .",
    "this implementation of the gate will therefore not work without extra quadrature squeezing , which in turn presents difficulties regarding the tuning of the quadrature .",
    "the wigner function and the marginal quadrature probability distribution for the bus state was constructed in terms of easily calculable generating functions .",
