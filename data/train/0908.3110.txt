    "the two - component degenerate fermi gas , in which the interaction between atoms of two different hyperfine states is made magnetically tunable via feshbach resonance , has been the main source of inspiration for much recent excitement at the forefront of ultracold atomic physics research .",
    "in addition to being an ideal system for the exploration of the crossover from a bose - einsten condensate ( bec ) of highly localized pairs to nonlocal bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairs , the degenerate fermi gas , when operating in the unitarity regime , constitutes a strongly interacting fermi gas exhibiting a rich set of physics , the study of which may shed light on long - standing problems in many different branches of physics , in particular , condensed matter physics .",
    "a unique phenomenon of low temperature femi system is the formation of correlated fermi pairs .",
    "how to detect pair formation in an indisputable fashion has remained a central problem in the study of ultracold atomic physics . unlike the bec transition of bosons for which the phase transition is accompanied by an easily detectable drastic change in atomic density profile",
    ", the onset of pairing in fermi gases does not result in measurable changes in fermion density .",
    "early proposals sought the bcs pairing signature from the images of off - resonance scattering light @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea is that to gain pairing information , measurement must go beyond the first - order coherence , for example , to the density - density correlation .",
    "this is also the foundation for other detecting methods such as spatial noise correlations in the image of the expanding gas @xcite , bragg scattering @xcite , raman spectroscopy @xcite , stokes scattering method @xcite , radio frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy @xcite , optical detection of absorption @xcite , and interferometric method @xcite . among all these methods ,",
    "rf spectroscopy @xcite has been the only one implemented in current experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative detection scheme , whose principle of operation is illustrated in fig .",

    "eit @xcite , in which a probe laser field experiences ( virtually ) no absorption but steep dispersion when operating around an atomic transition frequency , has been at the forefront of many exciting developments in the field of quantum optics @xcite . such a phenomenon is based on quantum interference , which is absent in measurement schemes such as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where lasers are tuned far away from single - photon resonance . in the context of ultracold atoms , an important example is the experimental demonstration of dramatic reduction of light speed in the eit medium in the form of bose condensate @xcite .",
    "this experiment has led to a renewed interest in eit , motivated primarily at the prospect of the new possibilities that the slow speed and low intensity light may add to nonlinear optics @xcite and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "more recently , eit has been used to spectroscopically probe ultracold rydberg atoms @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will show how eit can be exploited to reveal the nature of pairing in fermi gases .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig1.eps    before we present our detailed calculation , let us first compare the proposed eit method with the rf spectroscopy method which is widely used in probing fermi gases nowadays . in the latter @xcite ,",
    "an atomic sample is prepared and an rf pulse is applied to the sample which couples one of the pairing states to a third atomic level @xmath6 .",
    "this is followed by a destructive measurement of the transferred atom numbers using absorption laser imaging .",
    "the rf signal is defined as the average rate change of the population in state @xmath7 during the rf pulse , which can be inferred from the measured loss of atoms in @xmath8 .",
    "this process is repeated for another rf pulse with a different frequency .",
    "in addition to sparking many theoretical activities @xcite , this method has recently been expanded into the imbalanced fermi gas systems @xcite , where paring can result in a number of interesting phenomena @xcite .",
    "a disadvantage of this method is its inefficiency : the sample must be prepared repeatedly for each rf pulse .",
    "in addition , for the most commonly used fermionic atom species , i.e. , @xmath9li , the state @xmath6 interacts strongly with the pairing states due to the fact that all three states involved has pairwise feshbach resonances at relatively close magnetic field strength .",
    "this leads to so - called final state effect @xcite which greatly complicates the interpretation of the rf spectrum .    in the eit method , by contrast , one can directly measure the absorption or transmission spectrum of the probe light .",
    "applying a frequency scan faster than the lifetime of the atomic sample to the weak probe field , the whole spectrum can be recorded continuously in a nearly non - destructive fashion to the atomic sample .",
    "furthermore , eit signal results from quantum interference and is extremely sensitive to the two - photon resonance condition .",
    "the width of the eit transparency window can be controlled by the coupling laser intensity and be made narrower than @xmath10 . as we will show below , this property can be exploited to detect the onset of pairing as the pairing interaction shifts and destroys the two - photon resonance condition .",
    "in addition , due to different selection rules compared with the rf method , one can pick a different final state whose interaction with the pairing states are negligible [ see fig .  [",

    "finally , we note that the effect of the collisions involving the final state @xmath1 in the rf spectrum has been a topic of much recent discussion @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the spectra are not limited to the rf regime , and this may provide us with more freedom to choose @xmath58 ( and @xmath59 that minimizes the final state effect . in what follows , for the sake of simplicity ,",

    "the part of the hamiltonian describing the pairing of the fermions can be diagonalized using the standard bogoliubov transformation : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the quasiparticle energy dispersion .",

    "in summary , we propose to use optical spectroscopy in an eit setting to probe the fermionic pairing in fermi gases . we have demonstrated that the eit technique offers an extremely efficient probing method and is capable of detecting the onset of pair formation ( i.e. , determining @xmath120 ) due to its spectral sensitivity . with a sufficiently weak probe field",

    "<S> an optical spectroscopic method based on the principle of electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) is proposed as quite a generic probing tool that provides valuable insights into the nature of fermi paring in ultracold fermi gases of two hyperfine states . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has the capability of allowing spectroscopic response to be determined in a nearly non - destructive manner and the whole spectrum may be obtained by scanning the probe laser frequency faster than the lifetime of the sample without re - preparing the atomic sample repeatedly . </S>",
    "<S> a quasiparticle picture is constructed to facilitate a simple physical explanation of the pairing signature in the eit spectra . </S>"
