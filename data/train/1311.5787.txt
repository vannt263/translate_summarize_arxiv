    "dynamic robot locomotion is a particularly challenging study .",
    "one of its main difficulties is due to the fact that the robot is sub - actuated , that is , on a dynamic walking gait it is impossible to freely control each orientation of the robot s links .",
    "it is straightforward to see this limitation as there is no actuator between the ground and the support polygon , the gravity alone will impose an additional torque that will change the robot orientation . aside from this , a dynamic walking bipedal robot can achieve greater speeds than a static walker , so there is a practical interest in this domain of research .    in @xcite the problem of sub - actuated dynamic walking",
    "is treated in a systematic way that will lead to controller design with assured stability and also , with a step evolution clocked , not by the time , but by its own geometry .",
    "this self clocked characteristic will be instrumental in this work .",
    "we can see each step as a trajectory for the state vector of the dynamic model .",
    "the classical controller design will ensure the state of the model to track some reference tied to the time and some control effort will take place even if the robot state is valid for the reference trajectory but is not synchronized with the reference .    to successfully perform a step ,",
    "the robot links must be driven in some specific way , even for coordinates that can not be directly controlled . to accomplish this it may be necessary , for example , to swing the robot s torso and this can be undesirable in some cases .    to have complete control over one coordinate , it is necessary to give up the control of another one .",
    "so , if it is possible to ignore the position or the orientation of a link , it will be possible to control every other important coordinate . by using a inertial disc ,",
    "its orientation will be a cyclic variable , and thus , could be ignored . that is the main idea introduced by the design presented in @xcite and studied in many works as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "theoretically it is possible to ignore the disc position and speed , but in practice , there will be some limitation on the maximum speed achieved by the disc , so that the actuators do not saturate .",
    "one solution to this problem is proposed in @xcite by means of a supervisory control , that will perform a different trajectory if the disc speed is beyond some limit value .",
    "section [ sec : dynamic - model ] presents the hybrid dynamic model as proposed in @xcite .",
    "there is also a brief presentation of the hypotheses and terminology therein and inherited by this paper .",
    "next , it will be introduced the trajectory planning in section [ sec : design - of - thetrajectory ] .",
    "this is the main practical benefit of our approach , valid only for this specific class of bipedal robots . in @xcite ,",
    "the proposed strategy is to find the evolution of the robot geometry as function of the absolute orientation and then check if it will lead to a monotonic evolution of that absolute orientation . in our approach",
    ", it is possible to fix the robot geometry as a desired function of the absolute orientation . then find a monotonic evolution of the absolute orientation that lead to a repeatable evolution of the disc speed .",
    "another benefit is that the proposed control does not deal at all with the disc position , but can continuously control its speed .",
    "the control law and the convenient change of coordinates is also presented , introducing the core contribution of this paper .",
    "section [ sec : controlstability ] present a demonstration of exponential stability around some neighborhood of the planed trajectory .",
    "finally in section [ sec : numerical - simulations ] there are some simulation results .",
    "the robot will be modeled by a chain of @xmath0 rigid links , each one with known parameters such as mass , center of mass and inertia .",
    "the links are connected by @xmath1 frictionless joints independently actuated .",
    "there will be at least one and at most two point of contact with the ground , called foots .",
    "the foots are punctual and unactuated .    for illustration purposes ,",
    "a very simple bipedal robot is depicted at figure [ fig : chap2_examplebiped ] .",
    "the coordinate @xmath2 is the only absolute coordinate , @xmath3 is a relative coordinate to represent the disc position and @xmath4 is a relative coordinate representing the angular displacement between the two legs .    ]    on a higher order robots @xmath4 will be a vector representing the angular displacements between each link .",
    "indeed , the robot s shape will be determined by @xmath4 .",
    "the walking takes place on a surface , is restricted to the sagittal plane , and is composed of alternating phases of single and double support . during the single support phase , the stance foot acts as an ideal pivot .",
    "the double support phase is instantaneous and associated impacts are modeled as a rigid contact . at the impact , the swing leg touches the ground with no slip nor rebound and , the former stance leg releases without interaction .",
    "the robot model is derived under the hypotheses briefly cited above and detailed in @xcite , hr1~hr5 , hgw1~hgw7 and hi1~hi7 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p48  p50 ) ) .",
    "a small change is introduced in hr6 .    * the model",
    "is expressed in one relative coordinate @xmath3 for the disc , n-2 relative coordinates @xmath4 for the rest of the body and only one absolute coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "using lagrangian formulation , the dynamic equations for the continuous phase , between two impacts , will be    @xmath5 where@xmath6    @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and the vector of actuator torques being defined by @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is called the inertia matrix , @xmath12 is called the coriolis matrix , @xmath13 is called the gravity vector and @xmath14 will map the actuator torques as generalized forces",
    ".    it will be more convenient to define@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the angular moment of the system , calculated as @xmath17 @xmath18 being the last line of the inertia matrix .",
    "its derivative will be    @xmath19 @xmath20 being the last line of the gravity vector",
    ".    there will be a diffeomorphism between @xmath21 and @xmath22 and so it is possible to define the state vector@xmath23    and denote by @xmath24 the set of valid values for the vector state @xmath25 .",
    "at some moment , the swing foot will touch the ground with state @xmath26 and the system will be mapped to a new state @xmath27 . it is assumed that the walking gait is transversal to the impact surface .",
    "so , the impact forces will change the speeds on @xmath22 .",
    "after the impact the roles of the legs are reversed with a change in @xmath28 . as result , the system state , @xmath27 , after the impact is    @xmath29 with @xmath30 being a constant involutive matrix and @xmath31 a function of the robot geometry @xmath32 and absolute orientation @xmath33 .",
    "note that any value with a superscript @xmath34 means the value just before the impact at the end of the step , and a superscript @xmath35 means the value immediately after the impact at the beginning of a new step .",
    "this is the same notation utilized in @xcite",
    ".    the impact , modeled by the mapping @xmath36 , will take place at a given configuration that can be represented by a manifold @xmath37 , for example@xmath38 where @xmath39 is a convenient can express for example , the vertical position of the swing foot and will reach zero only when the swing foot touch the ground . ]",
    "function for which @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the complete hybrid model will be    @xmath42    for this particular class of robots , if the coordinate vector is choose as ( [ eq : vector_state ] ) then it is possible to demonstrate that the first column of @xmath31 is always @xmath43 .",
    "this is due to @xmath3 being a cyclic coordinate .",
    "in this section we present some aspects of the trajectory generation .      the idea of a geometry tied to the absolute orientation is presented in @xcite . in this kind of design",
    ", all the actuators will be used to drive the robot geometry as a function of the absolute orientation .",
    "this geometry must be chosen in a way that , apart from not being directly controlled , the absolute orientation will have a monotonic evolution .",
    "also , the interaction of the robot with the ground must produce a stable limit cycle .    in our robot , the disc position will be ignored .",
    "this allows us to get a new input available .",
    "every relative link orientation , except for the disc coordinate @xmath3 , should track a predefined function of @xmath2 .",
    "this way , at any time , the robot configuration will be a function of its absolute orientation .",
    "this kind of control is equivalent to drive @xmath44 to zero on the output defined as    @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the desired evolution of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the output described by ( [ eq : chap2_ouroutput ] ) has dimension @xmath1 which is the same dimension of the input @xmath48 .",
    "the dynamic system can be written in terms of the global diffeomorphism defined by@xmath49    if the decoupling matrix @xmath50 is square and @xmath48 have both the same dimension . ] and invertible , there exists a input @xmath51 so that by the use of @xmath52 and the coordinate change ( [ eq : coordinate_p ] ) , the system can be viewed as @xmath1 independent series of 2 integrators driven by the virtual input @xmath53 .",
    "thus , if it is possible to find @xmath52 , it will be possible to control every entry of @xmath54 by the input @xmath55 .",
    "more information on the exact linearization control can be found in @xcite .",
    "applying the change of coordinates defined by ( [ eq : coordinate_p ] ) it is possible to write @xmath56    using the input ( [ eq : chap2_linearinput ] ) , the change of coordinates ( [ eq : coordinate_p ] ) and discarding @xmath3 , it is possible to rewrite the continuous phase as@xmath57    now define an embedded manifold    @xmath58    from equation ( [ eq : linearizedsystem ] ) it is possible to see that the input @xmath59 can be used to drive @xmath60 .",
    "the input @xmath61 remains free to control the absolute speed @xmath62 and also , when restricted to @xmath63 , the angular momentum @xmath16 .",
    "assume that it is possible to find functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 , such that if @xmath66 , then @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is some constant bias .",
    "it is possible to use the input @xmath61 to exponentially attenuate this bias .",
    "the manifold @xmath63 is said to be forward invariant if solutions starting at @xmath63 will remain in @xmath63 .",
    "it will be said to be impact invariant if @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "observe that @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath63 is both forward and impact invariant , it is said to be hybrid invariant ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p 96 ) . while the feedback control can lead to forward invariance",
    ", the impact invariance is a design property .    for the nominal trajectory to be repeated",
    ", each variable evolution must be hybrid invariant .",
    "so , not only @xmath63 , but also the angular momentum reference @xmath65 , and the absolute speed reference @xmath72 , has to be hybrid invariant themselves .    one procedure to find such nominal trajectory would be :    1 .",
    "fix the absolute orientations at the beginning , @xmath73 , and at the end , @xmath74 , of the step , and the nominal configurations @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "2 .   determine a desirable evolution @xmath46 for the robot configuration , such that 1 .",
    "@xmath77 , as @xmath3 is a cyclic coordinate , it can be ignored ; this will ensure impact invariance on the robot shape @xmath46 2 .   depending on the value of @xmath78 , determine @xmath79 and @xmath80 for impact invariance of @xmath81 .",
    "there will be also a fixed increment or decrement of the angular momentum @xmath82 .",
    "this will lead to impact invariance on @xmath63 .",
    "3 .   choose a impact invariant and convenient function candidate for @xmath64 , then numerically calculate @xmath83 such that @xmath84 will satisfy the impact invariance restriction for @xmath65 .",
    "the control must ensure forward invariance and also a stability around this planned trajectory .      by construction of @xmath72 and @xmath65 , when restricted to @xmath63 , where @xmath85 , the following relation holds@xmath86 and so it is possible to write@xmath87 where @xmath88 is a unknown but bounded function .",
    "suppose now that exist hybrid impact invariant functions @xmath46 , @xmath72 and @xmath65 .",
    "then if we choose    @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 positive definite , this will ensure convergence of @xmath92 .",
    "the convergence @xmath93 will be independent of @xmath2 , @xmath62 , @xmath3 or @xmath94 and also @xmath63 will be forward invariant .",
    "the input @xmath61 can be freely used to drive the absolute orientation of the robot .",
    "it is theoretically possible to track any reference trajectory by the use of the output ( [ eq : chap2_ouroutput ] ) as we found a linearizable part of dimension @xmath95 , the side effect being that we do not have direct control over the speed accumulated by the disc .",
    "but there is an interesting property of this robot , as @xmath3 and @xmath94 can be ignored for the dynamic model .",
    "so the remaining coordinates will be @xmath96 , @xmath2 , @xmath16 , @xmath97 , @xmath62 . as @xmath2 is the only absolute",
    "coordinate , @xmath98 is also independent of @xmath2 .",
    "now define    [ eq : newcoordinates]@xmath99    with @xmath100 and @xmath101 positive constants .",
    "it is possible to define the manifold @xmath102 and it will be impact invariant . when the robot is performing the nominal step , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "as @xmath2 is monotonic at the continuous phase , it is possible to integrate ( [ eq : linearizedsystem ] ) at @xmath2 and rewrite it using the coordinates @xmath105 so , defining    @xmath106 using the input @xmath59 as defined in ( [ eq : chap2_controllaw_vr ] ) and @xmath61 as    @xmath107 then the continuous part of the dynamic system , subject to the given hypotheses , can be written as@xmath108 note also that by using the input ( [ eq : controllaw_vn ] ) , the impact invariant manifold @xmath109 will be forward invariant and thus , hybrid invariant .    in this",

    "if it is possible to find ( [ eq : chap2_linearinput ] ) for every possible value of @xmath25 , then the the system ( [ eq : hybridsystem ] ) , except for the disc position , can be made exponentially stable around some neighborhood @xmath135 of @xmath109 by using the inputs defined by ( [ eq : chap2_controllaw_vr ] ) , ( [ eq : controllaw_vn ] ) and adjusting the parameters @xmath90 , @xmath134 , @xmath101 and @xmath100 .",
