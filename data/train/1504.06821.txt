    "the stellar mass of a galaxy , @xmath0 , is one of its most fundamental properties .",
    "the assembly of @xmath0 is a long - standing issue in the field of galaxy formation and evolution . to elucidate how @xmath0 evolves",
    ", one would expect to recover the star formation history ( sfh ) , both in space and time , for individual galaxies . in practice ,",
    "the sfh of a galaxy is determined by finding the most plausible combination of evolved single stellar populations ( ssp ) that matches its observed spectrum or spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "this so - called `` fossil record method '' has been widely applied to the integral field spectroscopic ( ifs ) data and the multi - band images with good spatial coverage to study galaxy assembly @xcite .",
    "previous works have found two distinct stellar mass assembly modes .",
    "they are termed as `` the inside - out '' and `` the outside - in '' modes in the literature @xcite . in the `` inside - out '' scenario , mass assembly",
    "is firstly finished in the galactic central region .",
    "for instance , in a young disk galaxy , the disk instability will induce gas inflow and trigger starburst in the galactic center as it evolves . besides of star formation",
    ", the inflow gas can also fuel the central supermassive blackhole . the subsequent agn feedback ( such as blowing the gas out of the galaxy , or heating it against cooling down to form new stars )",
    "will then suppress the central star formation , leaving a compact , quiescent galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "compared to the central part , its outskirts form through much gentler process , such as the star formation driven by the gradually accretion of cold inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , or the accretion of small satellite galaxies .",
    "many works found that massive spiral galaxies have negative color or stellar age gradients , supporting this picture @xcite . compared to their massive counterparts , low mass galaxies",
    "have much shallower potential wells , making them less capable to retrieve the gas blowing by the galactic outflows , or accrete cold gas to form new stars .",
    "in addition , the role of agn feedback may not be so efficient in low mass galaxies , as their agn occupation fraction is very low @xcite .",
    "thus it is not surprised to see the low mass galaxies have a different mass assembly mode .",
    "in fact , observations show that the evolution of low mass galaxies can be better interpreted in an `` outside - in '' framework .",
    "@xcite    it is now clear that the galaxy assembly mode has dependence on its already formed @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , we know less about whether there is / or not a mass threshold which can roughly separate these two distinct modes . answering this question requires the investigation of a sufficient large sample , which expanding a wide mass range .",
    "recently , using the ifs data of 105 galaxies observed by the califa project @xcite , @xcite found that galaxies that are more massive than 5@xmath11 grow inside@xmath12out , while lower mass galaxies grow outside@xmath12 in .",
    "however , this sample is still relatively modest , and there are only about 20 galaxies with @xmath13 galaxies in this sample ( see their figure.1 ) .",
    "to study a larger sample , in this letter , we use the _ galex _ @xcite photometry , combined with the sdss @xcite data , to investigate how galaxy assembly mode depends on stellar mass . throughout this letter",
    ", we assume a concordance @xmath14cdm cosmology with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath18 mpc@xmath19 , and a @xcite imf .",
    "in this letter , we will investigate the stellar age in the central region , as well that of the global , in individual galaxies . for a galaxy , by comparing these two quantities",
    ", we can investigate whether its central part is first assembled .",
    "traditionally , stellar age is determined using broad - band optical photometry when spectral information is not available .",
    "however , the use of optical photometry has been plagued by the well@xmath12known age@xmath12metallicity degeneracy ( amd ) whereby young , metal - rich stellar populations produce optical colors which are indistinguishable from those produced by old , metal - poor populations @xcite . to avoid the amd",
    ", we use the nuv@xmath3 color index as an stellar age indicator , since it is sensitive to low level recent star formation ( rsf ) , but is unaffect by the amd when stellar age is < 1 @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "following @xcite s pipeline , we have constructed a uv - optical matched photometric catalog .",
    "this catalog contains about 220,000 galaxies with uniform photometric measurements on the resolution and psf - matched _ _",
    "galex__+sdss images , which are cross - matched by the sdss dr8 @xcite spectroscopic galaxies and the _ galex _ gr6 database . for each galaxy ,",
    "the fluxes were measured over 5 different apertures , with @xmath21[1.5 , 3.0 , 6.0 , 9.0 , 12.0 ] , in the @xmath22 bands . along with the aperture photometry",
    ", we also measure the total magnitudes of the galaxies with sextractor @xcite .",
    "all the magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction using the galactic dust map @xcite .",
    "the data reduction procedure is refereed to @xcite and @xcite .    to measure the nuv@xmath3 color index in the central region of a galaxy",
    ", one would expect the galaxy to be spatially resolved in both the _ galex _ and sdss images .",
    "the _ galex _",
    "nuv image has a pixel size of 1 pixel=@xmath23 and a point spread function ( psf ) with full width at half - maximum ( fwhm)=@xmath24 .",
    "the pixel size and psf of the sdss image are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . to ensure that the measured central nuv@xmath3 color index is not significantly affected by the relative poor resolution of the _ galex _ images",
    ", the chosen central aperture should not be smaller than the nuv psf , e.g , @xmath27 should not be smaller than @xmath28 2.7 . in the 5 apertures ,",
    "the @xmath29 aperture is thus most suitable to be chosen as the `` central aperture '' .",
    "then , we select the galaxies passing the following as our parent sample : 1 ) sdss minor@xmath12major axis ration @xmath30 ; 2 ) sdss @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the radii enclosed 90% of the sdss r - band petrosian flux ; 3 ) @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 is sdss spectroscopic redshift ; 4)@xmath35 , where @xmath36mag is the limited magnitude in the nuv band .",
    "the limit on @xmath37 is to minimize the dust reddening effect on our results . finally , we limit these galaxies to have stellar mass @xmath38 , to form a volume - completed sample at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the final sample size is @xmath40=11 , 294 .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath0 , and the spectral index @xmath7 used in this letter was drawn from the jhu / mpa database .    in the upper pannel of figure.1",
    ", we show the central flux fraction ( @xmath41 ) distribution for our sample , where @xmath41 was defined as @xmath42 .",
    "it can be seen that in the sdss r - band , the median value of @xmath41 is @xmath1 0.25 .",
    "one will also find that the @xmath41 distribution is much broader in the nuv band .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnoff ( ks ) test on these two distributions gives a small probability ( < 0.01 ) that they are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "this may be due to the highly different rsf in the galaxy central regions .",
    "figure.1 illustrates that , even for the @xmath43 galaxies , in the sdss r - band , their @xmath41 are not higher than 0.4 .",
    "thus for this galaxy sample , our chosen central aperture should be appropriate .",
    "distribution for our sample , where @xmath41 was defined as @xmath42 .",
    "the _ galex _ nuv and sdss r band is shown in blue and red histograms , respectively .",

    ", width=302 ]",
    "the color@xmath12magnitude diagram , or the color@xmath12mass diagram ( cmd ) , is widespread used in the literature to diagnose the galaxy evolutional stage @xcite . based on their positions on the cmd",
    ", galaxies can be roughly categorized into two main populations , e.g. , the red sequence galaxies and blue cloud galaxies .",
    "galaxies that lie between the `` blue cloud '' and `` red sequence '' , are called the `` green valley '' ( gv ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "gv galaxies were traditionally thought to be the transition populations between the star - forming and the quenched galaxies @xcite . to show the cmd clearly",
    ", we have divided the sample into 3 subsamples , according to their @xmath44 nuv@xmath3 , where @xmath44nuv@xmath45 ( nuv@xmath46)@xmath12(nuv@xmath47 ) . nuv@xmath46 and nuv@xmath47 are the color indices measured in the central @xmath48 aperture and that of the whole galaxy , respectively . the typical error of @xmath44 nuv@xmath3 , @xmath49 , is derived as @xmath50=0.80 , where @xmath51 is the number of galaxies with a @xmath44 nuv@xmath3 error of @xmath52 . for this sample , @xmath49 is 0.15 mag . in",
    "what follows , we called galaxies with @xmath44 nuv@xmath3>2@xmath49 as `` red - cored '' galaxies .",
    "the `` blue - cored '' galaxies are those with @xmath44 nuv@xmath3<@xmath53 .",
    "they are denoted in red and blue symbols in panel a ) of figure .",
    "2 , respectively .",
    "those galaxies with flat color gradients , e.g. , galaxies with|@xmath44 nuv@xmath3|<2@xmath49 , are shown in green symbols .",
    "all agns in our sample are narrow - line ( obscured ) agns , so there should be no contribution from agn continuum to the nuv@xmath3 color index .        in panel b ) , panel c ) and panel d ) of figure .",
    "2 , we show the @xmath54 ( nuv@xmath3 ) diagram for the blue - cored , flat - gradient and red - cored galaxies , respectively .",
    "the gray scale represents the galaxy number density of the _ whole _ sample . on the cmd",
    ", one can see the evident `` color bimodality '' .",
    "the gv region is arbitrarily defined by the two pink lines , with @xmath55<@xmath56@xmath57 , where @xmath0 is logarithm stellar mass .",
    "as shown in @xcite , galaxies with an nuv@xmath3 color less than 5.0 are very likely to have experienced recent star formation . in the blue cloud and gv region",
    ", the `` blue - cored '' phenomenon is thus corresponding to centrally concentrated star formation . in panel c ) , we show that flat - gradient galaxies distribute similarly with the whole sample on the cmd .",
    "this is expected since they are most numerous .",
    "strikingly , panel d ) shows that there are nearly no `` red - cored '' galaxies in the gv region below @xmath58 .    in figure.3",
    ", we show the fractions of the 3 kind galaxies , scaled with @xmath0 , in the blue cloud , green valley and red sequence .",
    "it is clear from figure .",
    "3 that at @xmath59 , the blue cloud and gv region is mostly populated by red - cored galaxies . in the gv region , we see a significantly increase of blue - cored @xmath60 galaxies when compared to the blue cloud , at the expense of a decrease of red - cored and flat - gradient galaxies .",
    "this can be interpreted as the outside - in quenching processes ( regardless of its working mechanisms ) transform a significant fraction of the red - cored and flat - gradient galaxies into blue - cored ones , and drive them evolve form blue cloud to gv . in the red sequence ,",
    "galaxies are mostly with flat color gradients .",
    "this is expected since when nuv@xmath3 color index is no longer sensitive to stellar age older than 1 @xmath20 @xcite . to summary ,",
    "figure . 2 and figure .",
    "3 confirms the findings of @xcite that @xmath60 galaxies mainly grow `` outside - in '' .",
    "the importance of the `` inside - out '' mode steadily increases with @xmath0 , and becomes dominant at around @xmath59 .          in this part",
    ", we will use a spectroscopic index , the @xmath7 index measured on the sdss @xmath61 aperture spectra as an central stellar age indicator .",
    "the @xmath7 is widely used as a mean stellar age indicator in the literature , since it is sensitive to the ratio of present@xmath12 to past@xmath12 average star formation rate @xcite , but is less affected by dust and metallicity .    in panel",
    "a ) of figure.4 , we show the @xmath7 versus nuv@xmath3 ( total ) relation for our sample .",
    "the grayscale represents the number density of galaxies .",
    "we can see that there is a positive relation between @xmath7 and nuv@xmath3 ( total ) , as also found in @xcite .",
    "the scatter of this relation reaches its maximum at nuv@xmath62 $ ] , .e.g .",
    "the gv region of the cmd . in panel b ) , panel c ) and panel d ) , we show the the @xmath7 versus nuv@xmath3 ( total ) relation for three subsamples , which are binned according to their @xmath0 .",
    "the color coded symbols are the same as those in figure .",
    "2 . in figure . 4",
    ", one can find that the red and the blue symbols are still separable .",
    "this confirms that the nuv@xmath63 is equivalent to the sdss @xmath7 index .    in panel b ) of figure .",
    "4 , we find that , nearly all of the @xmath60 galaxies have moved to the red sequence when their central @xmath7>1.6 .",
    "in contrast , in panel d ) , we find that a large portion of the @xmath59 galaxies still lie on the blue cloud or the gv region when their central @xmath7>1.6 .",
    "panel b ) and panel d ) together show that , there seems to be two separable evolution paths through which the blue cloud galaxies evolve into the red sequence . in this work ,",
    "it is naturally to interpret these two paths as the `` outside - in '' and the `` inside - out '' path , respectively .    in panel b ) , we show that the flat gradient galaxies are on the same path as those of `` blue - cored '' galaxies .",
    "thanks to the the accurate measurements of @xmath7 and nuv@xmath3 ( total ) , we can now conclude that at @xmath60 , the flat gradient galaxies follow a similar evolutionary path of the `` blue - cored '' when they move to the red sequence , e.g. , they evolve `` outside - in '' .    a potential issue which may affect the result of figure .",
    "4 is that we havent applied dust reddening correction to the nuv@xmath3 ( total ) color index .",
    "since the color index of the inclined galaxies are more easily reddened by the galactic dust lanes , to assess the role of dust on our result , we show the @xmath7 versus nuv@xmath3 ( total ) relation for the @xmath64 galaxies in figure . 5 . by comparing figure . 4 and figure . 5",
    ", we find that the result is not changed for the @xmath65 galaxies . at @xmath66 ,",
    "many @xmath10 galaxies are reddened by dust , but their distributions can still be separated from those of the @xmath60 on this diagram .",
    "this test suggests that the two separable paths revealed in figure .",
    "4 is intrinsic .",
    "in this letter , we investigate how galaxy mass assembly mode depends on stellar mass @xmath0 , using a large sample of @xmath110 , 000 low redshift galaxies .",
    "the use of _ galex _ photometry and sdss data enables us to study a large sample without the ifs data .",
    "we compare the stellar age indicator measured in the galactic centers to that of the whole galaxy , to determine whether the galaxy grows `` outside - in '' or `` inside - out '' .",
    "we find that : in the @xmath4 nuv@xmath3 ) green valley , the @xmath5 galaxies are mostly `` blue - cored '' or have flat color gradients , whereas the @xmath6 galaxies are `` red - cored '' .",
    "when their central @xmath7 index values exceed 1.6 , the @xmath8 galaxies have lied on the uv red sequence , whereas a large fraction of the @xmath6 galaxies still lie on the uv blue cloud or the green valley region .",
    "these findings suggest that the main galaxy assembly mode is transiting from `` the outside@xmath12 in '' mode to `` the inside@xmath12out '' mode at @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we interpret these results as a compromise between the internal and external process that driving star formation quenching in galaxies . the internal process , like the agn feedback ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the supernova feedback induced from the strong starburst activity @xcite , can blow the gas out of the galactic center , causing the `` inside - out '' evolution . the external process , like the environment effects , will strip the gas content of galaxies firstly from their outskirts , causing the `` outside - in '' evolution .",
    "the capability that a galaxy can retrieve the lost gas , or accreting new gas that rebuilds its outskirts , is its gravity .",
    "it is thus not surprising to see the galaxy assembly modes have strong dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "panel b ) of figure .",
    "2 shows that a significant fraction of the @xmath67 galaxies are `` blue - cored '' .",
    "previous works found that galaxies of this type are usually bulge - dominated systems , like the e+a galaxies @xcite or the early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be either explained as the `` survived '' star formation of an late type galaxy which is suffering gas stripping , or explained as the `` excess '' central star formation , probably triggered in an merge event . since the merge rate is rare in the local universe , we suggest that the `` survived star formation '' explanation is the case for the majority of the `` blue - cored '' galaxies , especially for the low mass ones .",
    "@xmath9 galaxies are mostly satellites of massive halos . in a group / cluster environment , ram pressure stripping @xcite and tidal interactions ,",
    "can remove the gas from galaxies , especially for those with low stellar mass densities @xcite .",
    "other gentler processes such as `` starvation '' and `` harassment '' , are also at work @xcite .",
    "the important role of dense environment on the formation of red dwarf galaxies is confirmed by the works focused on the virgo and coma clusters ( see @xcite for a review ) . in lower halo mass",
    ", @xcite found that quenched @xmath68 galaxies do not exist in the field , suggesting that the internal process alone is not sufficient in quenching star formation of low mass galaxies . at higher redshifts , using the cosmos data , @xcite found that the important role of environment on the evolution of @xmath9 galaxies have been in place at @xmath69 .",
    "the hierarchical paradigm for galaxy formation implies that galaxies experience a variety of environments during their evolution , and may have complex sfh at their early assembly epoch . in figure . 2 and figure.4",
    ", we can find that there are many `` red - cored '' dwarf galaxies in the blue cloud .",
    "however , these galaxies are not quenched , even their cores are older than the global .",
    "it is worth to mention why we focus on the gv galaxies at this point .",
    "gv galaxies are more close to the `` fully assembled '' stage than the blue cloud galaxies ( here we do not include those gv galaxies due to `` rejuvenation '' ) , hence holding important clues to the galaxy final assembly process . as can be seen in panel a ) of figure",
    "4 , when galaxies evolved into the gv region , there seems to be two separable paths connecting the blue cloud and the red sequence .",
    "this is expected if there is a dichotomy in the galaxy assembly modes .",
    "we find that the log @xmath70=[10.0,10.5 ] regime is a transition zone .",
    "this is not reported in @xcite , probably due to their small sample size .",
    "since the sample used in this letter is @xmath1 100 times larger than that in @xcite , our results should be reliable in a statistical sense . at higher masses ,",
    "our finding is in broad consistent with previous studies .",
    "the results of our work can be re - examined using the upcoming large data produced by the on - going ifs survey projects , such as califa , manga and sami in the near future .",
