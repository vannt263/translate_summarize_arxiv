    "the construction of leonhardt @xcite was based on conformal mapping on a nontrivial riemann surface . at the same time , pendry et al @xcite proposed a cloaking construction for maxwell s equations using a blow - up map and the idea was demonstrated in laboratory experiments  @xcite . for reviews on the topic , see  @xcite .",
