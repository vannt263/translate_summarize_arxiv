    "general theory of relativity ( gr ) is the formost theory of gravity and has passed a number of experimental tests .",
    "however , some future experiment might reveal deviations from gr .",
    "this is expected because gr can be thought of as an effective description of a fundamental theory of underlying quantum structure .",
    "effective classical limits of quantum gravity should contain all possible interactions with dimensionful length parameters representing scales at which new degrees of freedom emerge to play crucial roles .",
    "the idea is quite similar to the fermi theory of weak interactions .",
    "it is expected that as one goes higher in the energy scale , newer degrees of freedom emerge . in other words ,",
    "the degrees of freedom relevant to quantum gravity are supressed at lower energies ( for example , the energy scale at tevatron ) and are revealed only at scales of planck length .",
    "thus , it is very natural to construct other effective theories which have a limit to gr ( at lower energies ) while show considerable deviations at higher energies .",
    "examples of such theories include the brans - dicke theory , the einstein - cartan theory , extra dimensional models inspired by string theories and many more .",
    "the scalar - tensor theories are parhaps the most popular alternative to gr .",
    "the first of its kind was the brans - dicke theory @xcite .",
    "in conformity to the equivalence principle , this theory also considers gravity in terms of spacetime curvature .",
    "in addition , there exists a massless scalar field in the spacetime which together with the gravitational constant @xmath1 , determines the coupling strength of gravity to matter . in some limit",
    ", the standard gr equations are recovered .",
    "this theory is interesting because it includes the possibility of variation of effective gravitational constant influenced by the scalar field , which can be constrained by direct astronomical observations like the solar system test . in this paper",
    ", we shall not commit ourselves to a particular form of the scalar - tensor theory like the brans - dicke .",
    "instead , the most general coupling will be studied .",
    "it must be emphasised that these theories are different from gr . to exemplify , consider the brans - dicke theory with a non - minimal scalar coupling in the so called jordan frame ( or string frame ) with metric @xmath2 .",
    "in the einstein frame with metric @xmath3 ( conformally related to @xmath2 by the scalar field ) , the theory can be equivalently represented by a theory of a minimally coupled scalar field in curved spacetime .",
    "it might then seem that the theory is the same as gr ( with scalar field sources ) in different variables .",
    "the crucial difference is that test particles move along the geodesics determined by @xmath2 and will not ( in general ) coincide with that of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one is free to choose the frame for comfortable calculations . in the jordan frame ,",
    "the gravitational field equations are different and in the einstein frame , one has to account for the changes in the matter equations . either of these leads to deperture from gr .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend the formalism of weak isolated horizons ( wih ) for non - minimally coupled scalar fields ( for details of isolated horizon formulation see @xcite and for its applications , see @xcite ) .",
    "the rationale for such an extension is the following .",
    "we have argued that alternate effective descriptions of gravity ( other than gr ) can exist in which new degrees of freedom can become important at higher energies ( say the planck scale ) .",
    "black holes are ideal laboratories to look for effects of such non - standard degrees of freedom .",
    "if a non - minimally coupled scalar field becomes important at planck scales , it can leave its imprint on the entropy of these black holes .",
    "( string theories for example , predict existence of such scalar fields . ) thus , if one is able to determine the entropy of these black hole horizons , the exact dependence on these scalar fields will be clarified .",
    "the _ loop approach _ is one of the many ways of calculating entropy @xcite ( see @xcite for other approaches ) .",
    "here , one uses the formalism of isolated horizons to determine the effective topological theory on the black hole horizon , quantise it and count the states . through a canonical analysis of the palatini action",
    ", it was determined that this topological theory is a @xmath0 chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "entropy is then calculated by quantising the chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "holst s modification of the palatini action is another possible theory of gravity in @xmath4 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this action is in fact the starting point for loop quanum gravity ( lqg ) ( see @xcite for a detailed comparison of the palatini and the holst action ) .",
    "it is also possible to study the formalism of isolated horizons using the holst action .",
    "indeed , it is possible to construct the covariant phase space of the holst action admitting a wih as an inner boundary . through this completely covariant formulation",
    ", we also proved that the bounadry symplectic structure is that of a @xmath0 chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "entropy of wih can be calculated just as before by quantisation of the topological theory .",
    "thus , if the holst action is further modified to include a non - minimal scalar field coupled to gravity , the wih formulation will provide an ideal set - up to study the effects of these non - canonical fields on black hole entropy .",
    "in other words , the holst action modified to include non - minimally scalar field and extended to wih formulation will precisely be able to tell us , in a covariant framework , to what extent the scalar field contribute to the entropy of black holes in these theories .    to proceed for such calculations , we need to go through a series of steps .",
    "we shall first modify the boundary conditions for wih making it amiable to the case of non- minimal coupling .",
    "we will follow the modified boundary conditions already stated in @xcite .",
    "the zeroth law for the black holes will simply follow from these conditions . secondly , we shall have to modify the holst action to include the non- minimal scalar field coupling .",
    "this is non - trivial because we have to ensure that the phase space of this theory can obtained from non- minimal palatini theory @xcite by a one parameter canonical transformation ( just like in the standard case of minimal coupling ) .",
    "then the covariant phase space for the non- minimally coupled holst action admitting a wih as the internal boundary needs to be constructed .",
    "the first law for the wihs in this theory can be proved using the symplectic structure constructed on this covariant phase space .",
    "the first law for these horizons are expected to be modified induced by the non- minimal scalar coupling .",
    "this result was already obtained previously for the _ weakly isolated horizons _ using the non- minimally coupled palatini action .",
    "we shall rederive these results using the non - minimal holst action and for a more general class of horizons .",
    "this derivation of the first law ( from the symplectic structure of holst action ) will be non - trivial because the extra contrbutions form the holst action precisely cancel so as to lead to the standard results from the palatini theory @xcite .",
    "we shall then show that on the phase space containing spherical horizons of fixed area and show that the surface symplectic structure acquires the structure of a chern - simons theory although the scalar field will appear as a lebel of the chern - simons theory ( and hence the entropy ) .",
    "this possibllity was already predicted from killing horizon framework @xcite .",
    "such a dependence on scalar field was also derived through canonical formalism in @xcite .",
    "we put this result on a firmer basis by rederiving in a completely covariant way .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first section will contain a quick introduction of the wih formalism .",
    "the zeroth law will also be proved in this section .",
    "the second section will be used to define the non- minimally coupled holst action and then will be followed by construction of the space of solution of the theory admitting a wih as an internal boundary .",
    "the first law for the black holes in this theory will be caried out in the next section .",
    "we will also provide an alternative derivation of the first law .",
    "the fourth section will be devoted to the derivation of the chern- simons boundary symplectic structure on the phase space of fixed area .",
    "we provide a brief introduction to weak isolated horizons ( wih ) .",
    "( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "we shall now impose a minimal set of boundary conditions on the null surface @xmath10 so that effectively the surface behaves as a black hole horizon @xcite .",

    "thus , if the solution is such that the weyl tensor gives a contribution to @xmath231 , then the horizon admits an angular momentum . for spherical symmetric solutions however,@xmath232 .",
    "thus for the case of spherical solutions , the angular momentum is zero .",

    "the first law for this vector field will be : @xmath236",
    "arguments of bekenstein and hawking , based on the laws of black hole mechanics and semiclassical calculations , tells us that the entropy of black holes are equal to quarter of their areas .",
    "however , such an interpretation of entropy as area needs to be backed up by microstate counting _ a la _ boltzmann .",
    "knowledge of microstates lies beyond the domain of classical theory because the laws of the microscopic world are quantum mechanical .",
    "thus , one needs a quantum theory of spacetime for a satisfactory calculation of entropy .",
    "one of the statistical interpretations of black hole entropy is the _ loop approach _ based on loop quantum gravity @xcite . here , instead of knowing the microscopic degrees of freedom of the entire spacetime",
    ", it is proposed that we consider their effects on the black hole horizon .",
    "the basic idea is that the essential features of the black hole spacetime are captured by some effective degrees of freedom on the horizon which originate because of the interaction of bulk and the boundary of the spacetime .",
    "isolated horizon formulation is relevant because such surfaces capture the essential features of a black hole spacetime .",
    "one determines the effective theory induced at an isolated horizon , quantize it and count the appropriate quantum states .",
    "this turn out to be consistent with the semiclassical estimates made by bekenstein and hawking .",
    "the effective theory on the horizon can only be a theory of the topological kind , namely it must be insensitive to the metric on the horizon .",
    "this is because the horizon is a null surface and therefore can not support a physical particle .",
    "the above papers show , through a detailed canonical phase space analysis , that the effective theory on the horizon is chern - simons type , more precisely a @xmath0 chern - simons theory .",
    "the main objective of the section is to find out the symplectic structure of the effective field theory on a spherically symmetric wih of a fixed area , starting from the non- minimally coupled holst action in a completely covariant framework ( the derivation is similar in spirit to that in @xcite ) .",
    "we shall show that the claims in the abovementioned papers are reinforced independent of any slicing .",
    "since the horizon is spherically symmetric , the boundary conditions imply that the scalar field is constant _ on the horizon_. once these conditions are fulfilled , it follows from the einstein s equations that : @xmath237 where , @xmath238 and @xmath60 is spherically symmetric having contribution from the scalar field the other minimally coupled fields like maxwell fields _ etc_. the equation ( [ sphere_phie_exp ] ) implies that for spacetimes with cosmological constant zero , the term @xmath239 is spherically symmetric .",
    "further , it is not diffcult to check that ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath240 where @xmath241 are as previously defined ( see [ definitions_np ] ) .",
    "all the terms on the right hand side of ( [ sphere_grad_n])are real and @xmath242 is real , the term @xmath243 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath244 .",
    "then , the term @xmath245 is spherically symmetric .    using the equations ( [ sphere_grad_n ] ) and ( [ sphere_phie_exp ] )",
    ", we see that the term @xmath246 is again spherically symmetric . moreover , @xmath247 is constant over @xmath10 .",

    "it follows from ( [ exp - psi-2])that @xmath255 we shall use this expression [ epsilon_exp_sphere ] for the surface contribution to symplectic current for fixed areas phase space .",
    "we shall see that the surface symplectic structure is a @xmath0 chern- simons theory symplectic structure .    in ( [ exp_j_delta_d ] ) ,",
    "the potential @xmath176 is a function of @xmath47 only while @xmath256 is still a function of @xmath257 .",
    "a simple calculation gives @xmath258 now recall that the one - form @xmath102 has a rescaling freedom given by @xmath259 .",
    "this gives ( see ( [ trans_rule_uuv ] ) for the transformation rules ) @xmath260 to proceed further , we use the expression ( [ epsilon_exp_sphere ] ) in the symplectic current and integrate by parts and again use ( [ exp_holstv_sphere ] ) .",
    "this gives the following expression for the current @xmath261 now , note that @xmath262 is a function of @xmath263 whereas @xmath264 has only the dependence on @xmath265 and @xmath256 is @xmath47 dependent .",
    "in other words , the @xmath47 dependence of @xmath262 has been transferred to @xmath256 leaving @xmath264 only with the angular dependence . using this information",
    ", we get @xmath266 which is identical to the chern - simons symplectic structure .",
    "the full symplectic structure for the spherically symmetric and fixed phase space admitting a wih @xmath267 -\\frac{f(\\phi _ s)}{8\\pi g \\gamma}\\frac{\\mathcal{a}^{s}_{\\delta}}{\\pi}\\int_{s}\\ { \\delta_{1}v^{(h)}{}^{g}\\wedge \\delta_{2}v^{(h)}{}^{g}\\}\\ ] ] the boundary symplectic structure can be identified with that of a @xmath0 chern - simons theory ( because the symplectic structure involves only one type of connection @xmath268 ) with level @xmath269 . upon quantization the level becomes an integer .",
    "so @xmath270 has to be an integer in the quantum theory .",
    "this is a highly nontrivial result of the wih formlation .",
    "wih phase space includes both extremal as well as non - extremal types of horizons and what we find here is that the effective theory on the boundary is insensitive to these two types of horizons .",
    "the chern- simons gauge field does not see the @xmath12 scaling of the null normal @xmath17 , which controls the value of surface gravity for the horizon . in the quantum theory one",
    "essentially counts the surface states of the quantum chern - simons theory and hence , the entropy function is also expected to be insensitive to two types of horizons .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the classical phase space of non - minimally coupled host action admitting a wih .",
    "the boundary conditions for the wih amiable for the non - minimal scalar coupling is stronger than the boundary conditions in @xcite .",
    "the non - minimally coupled scalar field is constrained so that it remains constant along any @xmath17 in the class @xmath22 $ ] . in the standard case of minimal couplings ,",
    "the constancy of the field along @xmath17 arises because of the energy conditions .",
    "non- minimally coupled scalar fields violate this energy conditions .",
    "thus , this condition is put in by hand and suffices for our discussion .",
    "the zeroth law for the wih is a result of these boundary conditions .",
    "next , we have constructed the symplectic structure on this phase space and proved the first law .",
    "the essence of this derivation is similar to that in @xcite .",
    "we also included rotations and showed in a detailed derivation how the first law is changed .",
    "we have not included any minimally coupled fields like the maxwell field .",
    "the result of such inclusion is standard and can be derived as in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we have shown that on a fixed area phase space containing spherical horizons , the symplectic structure is that of a @xmath0 chern - simons theory .",
    "this result was only derived for the constant class of null - normals @xmath271 $ ] ( weakly isolated horizons ) in a covariant formalism ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we rederive these results for wih in a covariant phase space formulation .",
    "it is easy to map the covariant phase space results to canonical phase space ( see appendix of@xcite ) .",
    "let us point out the importance of these results .",
    "it is known that string theories generally predict non - minimal scalar field couplings . moreover , extremal black holes are ubiquitous in such theories @xcite .",
    "the standard prescription for calculating the entropy of these extremal black holes is the wald s noether charge approach @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this formulation is not well suited for the extremal black holes .",
    "indeed , in this case the extremal and non- extremal black holes belong to distinct phase spaces ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "thus , it is difficult to make sense of extremal limits of quantities defined for non- extremal black holes . on the other hand ,",
    "wih naturally encompass both extremal and non - extremal black holes horizons .",
    "the space of solutions admitting wih internal boundary has both the extremal and non- extremal solutions on the same footing . on this phase space",
    ", extremal black holes can be defined as a limit of sequence of non - extremal black holes",
    ". the laws of black hole mechanics for these two type of horizons are clarified in this formulation .",
    "we have also showed that the topological theory induced on the horizon is a @xmath0 chern- simons theory induced on wih is irrespective of the nature of extremality of the solution .",
    "indeed the chern - simons gauge field @xmath264 does not depend on the @xmath12 function which controls the extremality / non - extremality of the horizon .",
    "it will be argued thus that if the space of solutions has both extremal and non- extremal horizons , the entropy is same for both species .",
    "this is because , one essentially counts the surface states of the quantum chern - simons theory and hence , the entropy function is also expected to be insensitive to two types of horizons . in other words , wih is ideally suited for study of extremal and non - extremal black holes in the same footing .",
    "thus , the formalism is ideally suited for study of black holes in string theory .",
