    "the series @xmath2 where @xmath3 , can be expressed as @xmath4 this identity ( [ binomial_thm ] ) is called the binomial theorem . the binomial theorem ( [ binomial_thm ] )",
    "has many applications .",
    "for example , because @xmath5 from ( [ binomial_thm ] ) , we can perform numerical calculation of @xmath6 effectively ( cf .",
    "292 page in chapter 4 in part ii of [ eu ] ) : @xmath7 using ( [ binomial_thm ] ) like this , we are able to do numerical calculations of algebraic numbers .",
    "moreover , we obtain , for non - negative integer @xmath8 , @xmath9 thus , we can obtain combinatorial identities from ( [ binomial_thm ] ) . as seen above",
    ", the binomial theorem is very useful .",
    "analogically , if hypergeometric series which are generalizations of @xmath10 can be expressed in terms of well - known functions , then it is expected that those hypergeometric identities have many applications .",
    "indeed , transcendental numbers are expressed in term of hypergeometric series as we see later .",
    "further , it is known that most of combinatorial identities appearing in [ goul ] are special cases of those identities ( cf .",
    "[ an ] ) .",
    "that is why many methods for obtaining hypergeometric identities have been constructed . in particular , in the last several decades , many methods that exploit progress in computer technology have been formulated : gosper s algorithm , the w - z method , zeilberger s algorithm , etc .",
    "[ ko ] and [ pwz ] ) .",
    "these algorithms have been used to obtain and prove hypergeometric identities . in this article",
    ", we present a new method for finding identities for hypergeoemtric series , such as the ( gauss ) hypergeometric series , the generalized hypergeometric series and the appell - lauricella hypergeometric series .",
    "moreover , as an example of the application of this method , we give identities for the hypergeometric series ; we see that values of the hypergeometric series at some arguments can be expressed in terms of gamma functions , together with certain elementary functions . because our method systematically yields almost all known identities of this type besides many new identities , for completeness , we tabulate the entire set . in the appendix of this paper",
    ", we also make use of our method to have some hypergeometric identities for generalized hypergeometric series and appell - lauricella hypergeometric series . in particular ,",
    "hypergeometric identities for latter series have never been obtained .",
    "the reason comes from the fact that it is difficult to apply known methods directly to appell - lauricella hypergeometric series because these are multiple series .",
    "therefore , our method will become a powerful tool for investigating hypergeometric identities for many kinds of hypergeometric series , especially for appell - lauricella hypergeometric series .",
    "now , we present a new method for finding identities for hypergeoemtric series . to begin with , we give a proof of the binomial theorem ( [ binomial_thm ] ) , which is the model of our method . put @xmath11 .",
    "recalling that @xmath12 , we see @xmath13 we also get @xmath14 the above two formulae lead to @xmath15 thus , we find that @xmath10 and @xmath16 are linearly related over rational functions .",
    "furthermore , we can regard ( [ proof_binom ] ) as a first order difference equation with rational functions coefficients .",
    "now , we solve this difference equation ( [ proof_binom ] ) . because @xmath17 holds for any positive integer @xmath18 from ( [ proof_binom ] ) ,",
    "we see @xmath19 substituting @xmath20 in ( [ proof_binom2 ] ) , we get the following identity : @xmath21 since the identity ( [ proof_binom3 ] ) is valid for any non - negative integer @xmath18 , we find that ( [ proof_binom3 ] ) holds for any complex number @xmath18 by virtue of carlson s theorem ( cf . 5.3 in [ ba ] or lemma 3.1 in this article ) .",
    "thus , we get the binomial theorem .",
    "our method for finding hypergeometric identities is a generalization of this procedure .",
    "it is known that several hypergeometric series with the same parameters up to additive integers are linearly related over rational functions .",
    "suppose that this linear relation degenerates into a linear relation between two hypergeometric series under a condition , and further , this degenerate relation can be regarded as the first order difference equation with rational functions coefficients .",
    "then , solving this difference equation as we get the binomial theorem , we will obtain a hypergeometric identity . in this paper , applying this method to the hypergeometric series @xmath22 we actually obtain almost all previously known hypergeometric identities and , of course , many new hypergeometric identities . as stated previously",
    ", we will also make use of this method to yield some hypergeometric identities for generalized hypergeometric series and appell - lauricella hypergeometric series in the appendix of this paper .",
    "it is known that for a given triple of integers @xmath23 there exists a unique pair of rational functions @xmath24 satisfying @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the field generated over @xmath27 by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath1 ( cf .",
    " 1 in [ eb1 ] ) . this relation is called the * three term relation * of the hypergeometric series . from this , we obtain @xmath31 where @xmath32 let @xmath33 be a solution of the system @xmath34 then , for this @xmath33 , we have the first order difference equation @xmath35 or we have @xmath36 solving ( [ degenerated0 ] ) or ( [ degenerated1 ] ) , we obtain hypergeometric identities ; for example , if @xmath37 , then by substituting @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an integer satisfying @xmath40 , into ( [ degenerated1 ] ) , we find the hypergeometric identity @xmath41 in this way , we can find values of @xmath0 . in this paper , we call values of the hypergeometric series obtained by our method * special values * of the hypergeometric series .",
    "we summarize how to get special values of the hypergeometric series :    * step 1 : give @xmath42",
    ". * step 2 : obtain @xmath33 satisfying the system ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "* step 3 : solve ( [ degenerated0 ] ) or ( [ degenerated1 ] ) .",
    "we remark that the numerator of @xmath43 is a polynomial in @xmath18 over @xmath44 $ ] for a given @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain @xmath33 satisfying the system ( [ condition ] ) , we only have to seek the @xmath33 that eliminate all of the coefficients of this polynomial .",
    "namely , we solve polynomial systems in @xmath45 to implement step 2 .",
    "the grbner basis theory is useful for this .",
    "thus , we see that ( [ degenerated1 ] ) and ( [ -nk - k ] ) are valid for any integer @xmath18 from the constitution method of @xmath33 satisfying ( [ condition ] ) .    as an example , we give a special value for @xmath46 . because the three term relation for @xmath46 is @xmath47 we have @xmath48 hence , @xmath33 satisfying ( [ condition ] ) are @xmath49 .",
    "however , since the special values in the cases that @xmath50 are obvious from the definition of @xmath0 , we only consider the special value in the case that @xmath51 . in this case , we have the first order difference equation @xmath52 or we have @xmath53 for any positive number @xmath18 , where we assume @xmath54 which is the convergence condition of @xmath55 . noticing that @xmath56 we obtain @xmath57 for @xmath54 .",
    "this is called the gauss summation formula ( cf . [",
    "48 ] in 24 of [ ga ] ) .",
    "moreover , as a particular case of ( [ gauss ] ) , we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "though ( [ chu ] ) has been known since the 13th century , today , this is called the chu - vandermonde equality ( cf .",
    "corollary 2.2.3 in [ aar ] ) .",
    "the special values for other lattice points @xmath60 are considered in sections 3 and 4 .    in [ 48 ]",
    "in 24 of [ ga ] , gauss obtains ( [ gauss ] ) using ( [ gauss2 ] ) and ( [ gauss3 ] ) which are got by substituting @xmath61 into the relation @xmath62 therefore , our method is applied by gauss in the special case .    in the above example , we obtained the gauss summation formula ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "this is the general expression of @xmath0 at @xmath61 .",
    "hence , we only have to consider values of @xmath0 at other points .",
    "so , in step 2 , we seek @xmath33 satisfying the following : let @xmath63 be a triple such that the number of solutions of ( [ condition ] ) is finite , and let @xmath1 @xmath64 be one of its solutions ( cf .",
    "remark 2.4 ) .",
    "we call such a quadruple @xmath33 an * admissible quadruple*.    although we need to investigate @xmath42 for obtaining the special values of @xmath0 as seen in step 1 , we actually only have to investigate @xmath60 contained in @xmath65 we close this section by giving an outline of this statement ( see section 2 for details ) . the hypergeometric equation @xmath66 , where @xmath67 admits 23 hypergeometric solutions in addition to @xmath0 . for each of these solutions",
    ", there exists a relation similar to ( [ degenerated1 ] ) .",
    "for example , for the solution @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 appear in ( [ three_term ] ) .",
    "thus , because @xmath72 for an admissible quadruple @xmath33 , we can get special values of @xmath73 with this quadruple . the same",
    "can be done for the other 22 solutions .",
    "thus , for the lattice point @xmath60 , we are able to obtain special values of 24 hypergeometric series with the above quadruple .",
    "the identity ( [ degenerated2 ] ) implies that the special values of the 24 hypergeometric series mentioned above for the lattice points @xmath74 coincide with those for the lattice point @xmath60 ( see subsection 2.3 for details ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath74 is equivalent to @xmath60 with respect to the obtained special values . in fact , this holds generally , as all 24 lattice points represented by triples corresponding to the 24 hypergeomtric solutions are equivalent with respect to these special values .",
    "in addition , from the relation @xmath75 , which implies that @xmath60 is equivalent to @xmath76 , it can also be shown that the @xmath77 @xmath78 lattice points are equivalent with respect to these special values .",
    "these 48 lattice points form the orbit of @xmath60 under the action of the group @xmath79 on @xmath80 , where @xmath79 is the group generated by following mappings @xmath81 we remark that @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the symmetric group of degree @xmath18 . from this , regarding these 48 lattice points as equivalent , we can take ( [ quotient ] ) as a complete system of representatives of the quotient @xmath84 of this action ( see subsection 2.3 for details ) .",
    "thus , we only need to investigate the lattice points contained in ( [ quotient ] ) to obtain the special values of the hypergeometric series . in this paper",
    ", we tabulate the special values for @xmath60 satisfying @xmath85 .",
    "as stated in the previous section , for a given @xmath60 , the 24 hypergeometric solutions of @xmath86 with an admissible quadruple @xmath33 have two term relations as ( [ degenerated1 ] ) and ( [ degenerated2 ] ) , say degenerate relations . in this section , we list these degenerate relations explicitly .",
    "this list will be used subsequently , when we evaluate special values of the corresponding hypergeometric series . after presenting this list ,",
    "we give a proof that ( [ quotient ] ) can be taken as a complete system of representatives of @xmath84 .      in this subsection",
    ", we introduce contiguity operators .",
    "the contiguity operators of the hypergeometric series are defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "these operators satisfy the following relations : @xmath89 ( cf .",
    "theorems 2.1.1 and 2.1.3 in [ iksy ] ) .",
    "let @xmath90 be a composition of these contiguity operators such that @xmath91 also , @xmath90 can be expressed as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an element of the ring of the differential operators in @xmath1 over @xmath26 , and @xmath94 ( cf .",
    "( 2.4 ) in [ eb1 ] ) .      in this subsection",
    ", we list degenerate relations .",
    "@xmath86 admits the following 24 hypergeometric solutions ( cf",
    ". 2.9 in [ erd ] ) : @xmath95 in the above , we must take the appropriate branches of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we now apply both sides of ( [ composition ] ) to @xmath98 @xmath99 .",
    "first , noting the relation @xmath100 we have @xmath101 from ( [ three_term_f ] ) and ( [ composition ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath102 next , we apply both sides of ( [ composition ] ) to @xmath103 .",
    "this yields @xmath104 ( cf . (",
    "3.2 ) and lemma 2.2 in [ eb1 ] ) . combining this and ( [ qr ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath105 finally , applying both sides of ( [ composition ] ) to @xmath98 @xmath106 , we have the following :    we define @xmath70 and @xmath71 as ( [ three_term ] ) .",
    "then , we have @xmath107    using lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 , we are able to obtain 24 degenerate relations . for example , substituting @xmath108 into the top formula in lemma 2.2 , we obtain @xmath109 therefore , defining @xmath110 where @xmath111 , we find that @xmath112 for an admissible quadruple @xmath33 .",
    "the following is obtained similarly from lemmas 2.1 and 2.2 .",
    "fix @xmath42 . for an admissible quadruple @xmath33",
    ", we obtain the following 24 degenerate relations : @xmath113    from the treatment presented in section 1 , it is understood that @xmath1 in an admissible quadruple is not a free parameter .",
    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "if @xmath1 were a free parameter , then some of the 24 degenerate relations may be incorrect , while the special values obtained from the remaining correct relations would be trivial .",
    "( here ` trivial ' means obvious from the definition of @xmath0 . ) for example , in the case @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 this implies that @xmath116 and , therefore , the @xmath33 satisfying ( [ condition ] ) are @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in the former case , we find that the 12 degenerate relations ( xiii)-(xxiv ) are incorrect because the denominator of the coefficient of @xmath119 @xmath120 in lemma 2.2 contains @xmath28 as a factor .",
    "in addition , the special values obtained from the 12 correct degenerate relations are trivial .",
    "for this reason , we exclude cases in which @xmath1 is a free parameter from consideration .      in this subsection",
    ", we prove that we only need to investigate the lattice points contained in ( [ quotient ] ) to obtain the special values of the hypergeometric series .",
    "first , we show that the 48 lattice points that form the orbit of @xmath60 under the action of @xmath79 on @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "section 1 ) are equivalent with respect to the obtained special values .",
    "we do this by considering two particular examples , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and demonstrating that they are equivalent to @xmath60 with respect to the special values .",
    "the general result follows by analogy .    to begin with",
    ", we consider the case of @xmath122 .",
    "we start by replacing @xmath33 with @xmath124 .",
    "then , the three term relation for @xmath122 is expressed as @xmath125 and that for @xmath126 is @xmath127 these two three term relations lead to @xmath128 equating ( [ ( m - k , m - l , m ) ] ) with ( [ ( m - k , m - l , m)-2 ] ) , we have @xmath129 hence , the admissible quadruples for @xmath60 coincide with those for @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that the special values for @xmath60 coincide with those for @xmath122 ; that is , @xmath122 is equivalent to @xmath60 with respect to the obtained special values .",
    "we next show that @xmath123 is equivalent to @xmath60 with respect to the obtained special values . from the top formula in lemma 2.2",
    ", we have @xmath130 also , making the replacement @xmath131 , we find that the three term relation for @xmath123 is expressible as @xmath132 then , using @xmath133 and ( [ k , m - l , m-2 ] ) , we get @xmath134 finally , equating ( [ k , m - l , m ] ) and ( [ k , k - m , m-2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath135 therefore , the admissible quadruples for @xmath60 coincide with those for @xmath123 .",
    "this means that @xmath123 is equivalent to @xmath60 with respect to the obtained special values .",
    "we can show that the other 46 lattice points are equivalent to @xmath60 with respect to the obtained special values analogously .",
    "the reason that we assumed @xmath136 in the definition of an admissible quadruple @xmath33 is that if we do not make this assumption , there are cases in which the admissible quadruples for @xmath60 do not coincide with those for the other 47 points ( cf .",
    "( [ qq ] ) , ( [ k , k - m , m-3 ] ) and subsection 3.1 ) .",
    "next , we determine a complete system of representatives of the quotient of the action of @xmath79 on @xmath80 .",
    "recall that @xmath137 . to begin with",
    ", we find a complete system of representatives of the quotient of the action of @xmath138 on @xmath80 . from @xmath139 , we see that @xmath140 is identical to @xmath60 .",
    "hence , we can assume @xmath141 .",
    "further , because @xmath122 is identical to @xmath60 by @xmath142 , we can assume @xmath143 .",
    "in addition , because @xmath76 is identical to @xmath60 by @xmath144 , we can assume @xmath145 .",
    "thus , we can take @xmath146 , which we call @xmath147 , as a complete system of representatives of the quotient of the action of @xmath138 on @xmath80 .",
    "we now proceed to obtain a complete system of representatives of the quotient of the action of @xmath79 on @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath148 , then @xmath147 also contains @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . then , with @xmath154 we have the following : @xmath155 together , these imply that we are able to adopt ( [ quotient ] ) as a complete system of the quotient of the action of @xmath79 on @xmath80 .",
    "thus , we only have to investigate the lattice points contained in ( [ quotient ] ) to obtain the special values of the hypergeometric series .",
    "in this section , we derive the special values for some lattice points as examples .",
    "although we implicitly assumed that the parameter @xmath30 of @xmath0 is an element of @xmath156 , for the rest of paper , we expand the definition of @xmath0 .",
    "from this point , even if the parameter @xmath30 is a non - positive integer , we define @xmath0 as follows if the parameter @xmath28 is a non - positive integer satisfying @xmath157 : @xmath158      we first consider the case @xmath159 .",
    "then , the only @xmath60 satisfying ( [ quotient ] ) is @xmath160 .",
    "for this point , the corresponding three term relation is ( [ ( 0,1,1 ) ] ) , and this leads to @xmath161 hence , @xmath51 satisfies ( [ condition ] ) ( and so does @xmath162 , but for the reason explained in remark 2.4 , we do not consider this case ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath51 , because @xmath163 we have @xmath164 from this , substituting @xmath165 , where @xmath166 , we get the chu - vandermonde equality , ( [ chu ] ) .",
    "note that this equality holds even if @xmath30 is a non - positive integer with @xmath167 .    because @xmath118 is not an admissible quadruple",
    ", we should investigate the other 47 points .",
    "for example , considering the case @xmath46 , we get the gauss summation formula , ( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "similarly , we only get the chu - vandermonde equality and the gauss summation formula from the other 46 points .      in the case",
    "@xmath168 , because @xmath169 the numerator of @xmath43 is @xmath170 therefore , the admissible quadruple @xmath33 is @xmath171 , and @xmath172 where we denote @xmath173 by @xmath174 , and we also denote thus for the rest of this article .",
    "hence , ( i ) in proposition 2.3 leads to @xmath175 although ( [ ( 1,2,2 ) ] ) is valid by virtue of analytic continuation , this equality regarded as an infinite series expression does not make sense .",
    "for this reason , we carry out the degeneration of this into a finite series expression that does make sense .",
