    "gravitational lensing with stellar - mass black holes will also give rise to relativistic images ; however , unlike in the case of supermassive `` black hole '' lensing , these images will not be resolved from their primary and secondary images with present observational facilities .",

    "however , for a given source position their magnifications decrease very fast as the angular position @xmath23 decreases ( see table 1 ) , and therefore the outermost set of images , one on each side of the optic axis , is observationally the most significant .",
    "the angular separations among relativistic images are too small to be resolved with presently available instruments and therefore all these images would be at the same position ; however , these relativistic images will be resolved from the primary and secondary images and thus resolution is not a problem for observation of relativistic images .    if we observe a full or `` broken '' einstein ring near the centre of a massive dark object at the centre of a galaxy with a faint relativistic image of the same source at the centre of the ring , we would expect that the central ( relativistic ) image would disappear after a short period of time .",
    "if seen , this would be a great success of the general theory of relativity in a strong gravitational field .",
    "observation of relativistic images would also give an upper bound on the compactness of the lens . to get a relativistic image",
    "a light ray has to suffer a deflection by an angle @xmath141 . for the closest distance of approach @xmath142 the deflection angle @xmath143 and",
    "therefore @xmath144 can be considered as an upper bound to the compactness of the lens .",
    "the fact that the magnification of a relativistic image decreases very fast as the source position increases from its perfect alignment with the lens and observer can be exploited to give a better estimate of the compactness of the lens . for the lens system considered in section four ,",
    "the outermost relativistic einstein ring has angular radius about @xmath121 microarcseconds and this is formed due to light rays bending at the closest distance of approach @xmath145 ( see table @xmath59 ) . as a relativistic image",
    "can be observed only very close to a relativistic tcc , the above value of the @xmath146 gives an estimate of compactness of the massive dark object .",
    "there are some serious difficulties hindering the observation of the primary - secondary image pair near a galactic centre ; the observation of relativistic images is even much more difficult . the extinction of electromagentic radiation near the line of sight to galactic nuclei would be appreciable ; the smaller the wavelength , the larger the extinction .",
    "the interstellar scattering and radiation at several frequencies from the material accreting on the `` black hole '' would make these observations more difficult .",
    "due to these obstacles no lensing event near a galactic centre has been observed till now , but it seems this is a very worthwhile project .",
    "there are some additional difficulties for observing relativistic images .",
    "first , these images are very much demagnified unless the source , lens and observer are highly aligned",
    ". when the source position @xmath25 decreases the magnification increases rapidly and therefore one may possibly get observable relativistic images , but only if the source , lens and observer are highly aligned ( @xmath147 microarcsecond ) and the source has a large surface brightness .",
    "quasars and supernovae would be ideal sources for observations of relativistic images .",
    "the number of observed quasars is low ( about @xmath85 , see in @xcite ) and therefore the probability that a quasar will be highly aligned along the direction of any galactic centre of observed galaxies is extremely small . similarly , there is a very small probability that a supernova will be strongly aligned with any galactic centre .",
    "we considered a normal star in the galaxy to be a point source ( note that we took @xmath56 ) .",
    "we can not use the point source approximation when such a source is very close to the caustic ( @xmath36 ) and therefore studies of extended source lensing are needed .",
    "second , if relativistic images were observed it would be for a short period of time because the magnification decreases very fast with increase in the source position ; however , the time scale for observation of relativistic images will be greater for lensing of more distant sources .",
    "it is highly improbable that the relativistic images would in fact be observed in a short observing period and a long term project to search for such images would not have reasonable probability of success .",
    "nevertheless the possibility remains that such images might be detected through lucky observations in the vicinity of galactic centers .",
    "we obtained a lens equation which allows an arbitrary large values of the deflection angle and used the deflection angle expression for the schwarzschild metric obtained by weinberg@xcite .",
    "this gives the bending angle of a light ray passing through the schwarzschild gravitational field for a closest distance of approach @xmath1 in the range @xmath148 . using this we studied gl due to the galactic `` black hole '' in a strong gravitational field .",
    "apart from a pair of images ( primary and secondary ) which are observed due to light deflection in a weak gravitational field , we find a sequence of large number of relativistic images on both sides of the optic axis due to large deflections of light in a strong gravitational field near the photon sphere @xmath138 . among these relativistic images ,",
    "the outermost pair is observationally the most important .",
    "though these relativistic images are resolved from the primary and secondary images , there are serious difficulties in observing them . however",
    ", if it were to succeed it would be a great triumph of the general theory of relativity and would also provide valuable information about the nature of massive dark objects .",
    "observations of relativistic images would confirm the schwarzschild geometry close to the event horizon ; therefore these would strongly support the black hole interpretation of the lensing object . in the investigations in this paper",
    "we modelled the massive compact objects as schwarzschild lens .",
    "however , it is worth investigating kerr lensing to see the effect of rotation on lensing in strong gravitational field , especially when the lens has large intrinsic angular momentum to the mass ratio .",
    "there have been some studies of kerr weak field lensing ( see rauch and blandford@xcite and references therein ) . in passing ,",
