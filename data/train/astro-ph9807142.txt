    "it has long been suggested that the putative accretion disk around the black hole of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) will emit copious amounts of uv and soft x - ray radiation ( shields 1978 , rees 1984 ) .",
    "thus the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an agn across this range should provide crucial information about the accretion disk , reprocessing mechanisms close to the active nucleus and physical conditions in the circumnuclear material .",
    "determination of the x - ray to ultraviolet ( xuv ) continuum in agn has been extremely difficult because of the severe attenuation of photons of these energies by even small amounts of material along the line - of - sight to the agn .",
    "however , some indication of the strength of the unseen continuum has been inferred from the strengths of emission lines such as heii @xmath9 ( e.g. mathews & ferland 1987 ) .",
    "in fact , a long - standing suggestion has been that there is a so - called `` blue - bump '' of continuum emission , peaking in the unseen xuv regime ( shields 1978 , malkan & sargent 1982 ) .",
    "the advent of new and sensitive satellites has started to narrow the `` unobservable '' bandpass .",
    "for example , observations of high - redshift quasars by _ hst _ has enabled measurement of the continuum up to the lyman limit , while the _ rosat _ wide field camera and the extreme ultraviolet explorer _",
    "euve _ have provided measurements in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath10 kev ) .",
    "four seyferts are listed as detections by the wfc ( pounds  1993 ) , furthermore , ( at least ) 17 seyferts were detected by _ euve _ ( marshall  1995 , fruscione 1996 ) .",
    "rapid variability in the _ euve _ flux of several sources indicated the observed radiation to be originating in the inner nucleus ( e.g. marshall  1996 ; marshall  1997 ) .",
    "recent work by zheng  ( 1997 , 1995 ) has suggested the form of the unseen xuv spectrum is falling between the lyman limit ( at 912  ) and @xmath11 kev as @xmath12 .",
    "laor  ( 1997 ) combine this with a mean soft x - ray spectrum , based upon _",
    "rosat _ observations of quasars , to dispute the existence of a large xuv - bump .",
    "korista , ferland and baldwin ( 1997 ) have discussed the problem that extrapolating the known soft x - ray spectrum of agn , there appear to be too few 54.4 ev photons to account for the strength of the observed heii lines .",
    "they consider the possibility that the broad - line clouds see a harder continuum than the observer does , or that the xuv spectrum has a double - peaked shape .",
    "clearly , a careful determination of the detailed shape of the xuv continuum would provide a large step forward in our understanding of many fundamental processes in agn .",
    "while numerous observations of agn have been performed in the past , little is known about the spectral shape below @xmath13 kev .",
    "previous soft x - ray observations have yielded narrow - band spectra with low energy resolution ( e.g. _ rosat _ , _ einstein _ ipc , _ exosat _ cma ) .",
    "_ asca _ has only yielded reliable spectra above 0.6 kev ( although data may eventually be reliable down to 0.4 kev , with improved calibration ) .",
    "disagreements between _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data , in the overlap bandpass ( 0.6 - 2 kev ) have led to some controversy as to whether the underlying continua of emission - line agn actually do steepen to softer x - ray energies or whether there is a miscalibration between instruments . _",
    "asca _ and _ rosat _ data aside , some sources definitely show a significant spectral softening below @xmath14 kev in data from earlier missions ( e.g. arnaud 1985 , turner   1993 ) , however , in most cases , the physical origin of this effect is ambiguous .",
    "it is now known that the majority of seyfert  1 galaxies suffer attenuation by ionized material ( reynolds 1997 ; george  1998 ) which can have a reduced opacity in the soft x - ray band and produce an observed spectrum which steepens to soft energies . in most cases studied to date ,",
    "x - ray spectra do not allow us to distinguish between a single continuum component attenuated by ionized material , and steepening of the underlying emission spectrum .",
    "clearly , the best sources for attempting to unambiguously distinguish between the aforementioned pictures should be bright in the soft x - ray regime , and have minimal absorption .",
    "lb  1727 is the fourth brightest seyfert galaxy detected by _ euve _",
    "( marshall  1995 ) , yet has a very flat spectrum in the hard x - ray regime ( guainazzi  1998 ) compared to most seyfert  1 galaxies ( george  1998 and references therein ) .",
    "these two properties suggest the source might show a marked steepening of spectral slope in the soft x - ray regime ; this , combined with the low galactic column along the line - of - sight , makes lb  1727 a good target to search for the soft x - ray tail of an xuv - bump .",
    "lb  1727 is a very blue object first noted by luyten & miller ( 1956 ) during their search for faint blue stars .",
    "the x - ray source 1h  0419 - 577 was discovered in the sky - survey performed by the heao-1/a1 experiment , covering the 0.25  25 kev band , during late 1977 to early 1978 ( wood  1984 ) . at that time ,",
    "the 2  10 kev flux was @xmath15 in the rest - frame .",
    "the heao-1/a1 survey was followed by a program of optical identifications , and an analysis of heao-1/a3 x - ray positions identified a seyfert galaxy ( v = 14.3 ; z = 0.104 ) as the optical counterpart to the heao-1 x - ray source ( brissenden et al .",
    "the source was later detected in the einstein slew survey ( elvis  1992 ) and by _ rosat _ with both the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and the wide field camera ( wfc ; pounds  1993 ) .",
    "thomas  ( 1998 ) confirmed lb  1727 to be a bright x - ray source and a seyfert 1.5 galaxy ( grupe 1996 ; thomas  1998 ) .",
    "confusion has arisen on several ocassions , as to whether lb  1727 and 1h 0419 - 577 are the same source or not ; they are .",
    "an error in some _ euve _ finding charts led to confusion because 1h  0419 - 577 and lb  1727 were wrongly marked as two different sources in those charts .",
    "this error eventually resulted in an incorrect position assignment for lb  1727 , in the veron - cetty & veron catalog ( 1996 ) . despite this early confusion , marshall  1995 did correctly identify 1h 0419 - 577 as a strong _ euve _ detection of an agn .",
    "comparison between the original position found by luyten & miller ( 1956 ) , and the optical , _ rosat _ and _ euve _ positions confirm lb  1727 and 1h  0419 - 577 to be the same source , a seyfert galaxy , and the origin of all data presented here .",
    "guainazzi  ( 1998 ) report the results from a _ bepposax _ observation of lb  1727 performed 1996 september 30 .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath16 ks with the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) which has an effective bandpass @xmath17 kev .",
    "unfortunately the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) , which covers the 0.1  10 kev band , was switched off during the observation because of technical problems .",
    "the source was also marginally detected in the _ bepposax _ phoswich detector system ( pds ) , providing some constraint on the flux up to 36 kev .",
    "the _ bepposax _",
    "data revealed a flat spectrum in the 1  10 kev ( observed ) band , with photon index @xmath18 and no evidence for line emission from the k - shell of iron .",
    "guainazzi  ( 1998 ) also reported an index @xmath19 from pspc data covering the 0.1  2 kev band , indicating marked spectral variability and/or a sharp steepening of the spectrum below @xmath20 kev .    here",

    "lb  1727 has been observed several times in attempts to identify sources from hard and soft x - ray surveys ( brissenden  1989 ; grupe 1996 ; thomas 1998 , guainazzi  1998 ) .",

    "[ fig : opt ] .",
    "the first two panels show spectra accumulated during 1988 feb 17 and 22 , on the australian national university ( anu ) 2.3 m telescope and the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , respectively .",
    "the aat spectrum was obtained with the combined use of the image photon counting system ( 3   fwhm resolution ) and the faint object red spectrograph ( 20   fwhm ) .",
    "a dichroic mirror was used to split the incoming beam at @xmath23  to supply the photons for each device .",
    "similarly , the anu observations were made with the double beam spectrograph ( 3   fwhm ) .",
    "an optical spectrum was also accumulated 1993 sept 14 with the mpi / eso 2.2 m telescope at la silla , using the faint object spectrograph and camera .",
    "the eso 2.2 m observations used grisms yielding 5   fwhm resolution over the 6600  7820    and 4640  5950   bandpasses , plus 22    fwhm over the 3400 - 9200    bandpass ; with exposure times of 15 , 20 and 5 minutes respectively .",

    "1 shows the continuum rises very steeply blueward of 4500  , most visible in the aat data , indicating the presence of a strong blue bump in this source .",
    "the optical continuum has an energy index @xmath24 measured between",
    "4400  7000    ( grupe et al",
    ". 1998a ) .",
    "the strong _ euve _ flux ( marshall  1995 ) and steep spectrum in the soft x - ray regime ( guainazzi  1998 ) might lead us to expect to see an optical spectrum reminiscent of a narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nlsy1 ) ; however , from an inspection of the line profiles in fig .",
    "1 it is clear that this is not the case .",
    "nlsy1s are those objects with the narrowest optical permitted lines in the distribution covered by seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "the widths of the broad components of h@xmath6 and h@xmath25 are typically only slightly broader than the forbidden lines . in general authors",
    "usually use fwhm h@xmath26 km / s ( or sometimes @xmath27 km / s ) and the presence of strong feii emission to distinguish between seyfert 1s and nlsy1s . the ratio ` [ ` oiii`]`/h@xmath28 , is also used to differentiate nlsy1 from seyfert  2 galaxies . in the case of lb  1727 the width of the broad h@xmath25 component",
    "does not fit into the nlsy1 definition .",
    "the aat data yielded fwhm ` [ ` oiii ` ] ` @xmath29 ( 1 @xmath30 errors are quoted on optical measurements in this section ) fwhm h@xmath31 and h@xmath32 .",
    "for the anu data the ` [ ` oiii ` ] ` line was fit with a gaussian profile , yielding fwhm@xmath33 .",
    "a template was made of this line profile , and this was scaled to the flux of the narrow component of h@xmath25 .",
    "the scaled template was shifted to the wavelength of the narrow component of the h@xmath25 line and then subtracted from the total h@xmath25 profile .",
    "the remaining h@xmath25 profile was then dominated by the broad component of h@xmath25 , which yielded a width measurement @xmath34 .",
    "this left a residual narrow component of h@xmath25 with fwhm=@xmath35 .",
    "( it was not possible to satisfactorily apply this method to the aat data ) .",

    "the errors given in this section are 1@xmath30 .",
    "the measurements might imply variability in the width of h@xmath25 , however , these data were all taken using different instrument combinations with a variety of spectral resolutions , and conclusive detection of variability could only be obtained by monitoring the source for several days with a single instrument .",
    "the ` [ ` oiii`]`/h@xmath25 ratio ( @xmath5 10 ) is large and there is no evidence of fe ii emission , which is most clearly evident from the aat data .",
    "grupe  ( 1998b ) report an upper limit on the equivalent width for fe ii emission between 4250 - 5880    to be 30 , and an upper limit on the ratio feii / h@xmath25 of 0.4 .    to determine the balmer decrement we used the total fluxes in the h@xmath6 and h@xmath25 lines because it is not possible to estimate the broad and narrow decrements separately due to problems deconvolving the components of h@xmath6 . by using the ` [ ` oiii ` ] ` template we are able to subtract the narrow line emission from the h@xmath25 line , but this is not possible with the h@xmath6 line .",
    "unfortunately , h@xmath6 is also contaminated by the ` [ ` nii ` ] ` 6548   and 6584   emission . to subtract the contributions of these lines we subtracted 35% of the ` [ ` oiii`]`5007 line flux from the total h@xmath6 line flux .",
    "( the ` [ ` nii`]`/`[`oiii ` ] ` ratio was suggested by ferland & osterbrock , 1986 ) .",
    "subtracting this contaminating flux allows us to make an estimate of the mean balmer decrement , h@xmath6/h@xmath39 .",
    "this decrement can be interpreted as an optical extinction @xmath40 which in turn corresponds to an x - ray absorption @xmath41 , assuming material with a galactic dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "however , the relatively low value of the decrement , and the uncertainty in that ratio makes this extinction determination somewhat tentative .",
    "in fact , the optical _ continuum _ is unattenuated .",
    "the latter might infer that the balmer decrement is attributable to optical depth effects in the line - producing clouds rather than absorption by material in our line - of - sight .",

    "lb  1727 was observed by _ asca _",
    "1996 july 22  23 and august 10  11 .",
    "the data were reduced in the same way as the seyfert galaxies presented in nandra  ( 1997 ) and turner  ( 1997 ) . for details of the data reduction method",

    "a month later on 1996 september 30 ( guainazzi  1998 ) and a factor of 2 lower than that observed by heao-1/a1 ( wood  1984 ) 19 years earlier .",
    "the mean _ asca _ flux implies a luminosity of @xmath48(2 - 10 kev)@xmath49 ( assuming h@xmath50 , q@xmath51 ) .",
    "we tested the light curves for variability using the @xmath52 statistic .",

    "there is a @xmath53 increase in soft flux and a @xmath54 increase in the 2  10 kev flux between july and august 1996 .",
    "integration using 1024 s bins revealed evidence ( at @xmath55 confidence ) for flickering at the 10  30% level in both bands during the july observation , but no significant variability during the august observation .",
    "_ asca _ data cover the 0.4 - 10 kev band in the observers frame .",
    "however , the sis data below an energy of 0.60 kev ( 0.66 kev rest - frame ) were excluded from the spectral analysis as it is commonly accepted that there are uncertainties associated with the _ asca _ calibration in that band . following george  ( 1998 ) , we make use of the fact that the calibration uncertainty is considered to be @xmath1% , and usually results in a systematic deficit of counts versus the predicted model . if data in the 0.40 - 0.60 kev band lie above the extrapolation of our model , then the source spectrum most likely does steepen in that band .",
    "later we take the approach of indicating where these data lie , although we never use them in a fit .",
    "data in the 4.5 - 6.8 kev range ( 5 - 7.5 kev in the rest - frame ) were initially excluded , to remove temporarily the channels in which iron k@xmath6 emission would occur if present in this source .",
    "this exclusion allows us to parameterize the continuum shape more easily .",
    "we first considered the continuum in the observed 1.81  9.06 kev band ( 2 - 10 kev rest - frame ) using a power - law attenuated by a column of neutral material .",
    "preliminary fits showed no evidence for absorption , so the absorbing column density was fixed subsequently at the galactic value estimated from 21 cm measurements , @xmath56 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the extremely large _ euve _ count rate suggests the effective xuv absorbing - column may be even lower than this ( cf marshall  1995 ) .",
    "the 1996 july data yielded a photon index @xmath57(2 - 10)@xmath58 and @xmath59 for 319 degrees of freedom ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we then fit the same model to the full _ asca _ band , i.e. ( 0.6 - 10 kev observed - frame , 0.66 - 11.1 kev rest - frame , still excluding the iron k@xmath6 band ) .",
    "this yielded @xmath57(0.66 - 11.1)@xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "thus there is no evidence for significant spectral curvature down to a rest - energy of @xmath5 0.7 kev .",
    "the ratio of the data compared to this model are shown ( in bold ) in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : asca_rat ] , along with the corresponding ratios ( dashed ) for the data in the 0.40 - 0.60 kev and 4.5 - 6.8 kev bands ( observer - frame ) .",
    "there are two points to note from fig .",
    "[ fig : asca_rat ] : the indication of a steepening of the spectrum below a rest - energy @xmath50.7 kev and a marginal indication of line emission in the iron k@xmath6 regime .",
    "given the suggestion of emission in the iron k@xmath6 regime we have repeated the spectral analysis , but including the data in the 4.5 - 6.8 kev band ( observers - frame ) , we find the addition of a gaussian emission component to the model provides a reduction in @xmath63 of 11 , for three fewer @xmath60 ( compared to a model without a gaussian component ) .",
    "this suggests the presence of an emission line at the 95% confidence level .",
    "we find such a model to provide an adequate description of the data ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the line has a rest - energy @xmath65 kev , width @xmath66 kev and intensity @xmath67 and equivalent width @xmath68 ev . next to an error indicates that the error calculation reached the highest or lowest value allowed and thus the actual 90% limit lies at or beyond the limit set in the fit for that parameter ] this is the first detection of iron k@xmath6 emission from this source . while the line detection appears marginal in fig .",
    "[ fig : asca_rat ] , we will show that the august data strongly confirm the existence of an iron k@xmath6 line in this source .",
    "there were too few photons in the line to merit more detailed modeling of the profile .",
    "we treated these data in the same way as the july observation . considering only the 210  kev band ( rest - frame ) , but excluding the iron k@xmath6 regime , we find a power - law attenuated by galactic absorption provides an adequate description of the data ( @xmath69 ) with @xmath57(2 - 10)@xmath70 .",
    "such a model also provides an adequate description of the full _ asca _ band ( excluding the iron k@xmath6 regime ) giving @xmath71 and @xmath57(0.66 - 11.1)@xmath72 , significantly steeper than the index observed in the july observation .",
    "the data / model ratio for this fit are shown ( in bold ) in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : asca_rat ] . as above , the corresponding ratios for the data in the 0.40 - 0.60 kev and 4.5 - 6.8 kev bands ( observer - frame )",
    "are shown dashed .",
    "it can be seen that at this epoch there are also clear indications of a steepening of the spectrum below a rest - energy @xmath50.7 kev .",
    "however , the _ asca _ data alone do not allow us to distinguish between the presence of a complex absorber , or of a separate continuum component .",
    "these data confirm that lb  1727 exhibits iron k@xmath6 emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asca_rat ] ) .    from repeating the spectral analysis , but including the data in the iron k@xmath6 band , we find the addition of a gaussian emission component to the model is significant at @xmath73% confidence ( providing a reduction in @xmath63 of 35 for three fewer @xmath60 compared to a model without such a component ) . as for the earlier epoch",
    ", such a model provides an adequate description of the data ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we find the line to have a rest - energy @xmath75 kev , with width @xmath76 , intensity @xmath77 photons @xmath78 s@xmath79 and @xmath80 ev at this epoch .",
    "again , there were too few photons in the line to merit more detailed modeling of the profile .",
    "the photon index is unaffected by the addition of the line , and we note that the source appears steeper at this epoch , than during the july observation . with @xmath81 .",
    "lb  1727 was monitored daily by the hri , covering a two month period from 1996 june 30 to 1996 september 01 , including a long integration simultaneous with the _ asca _ observation in july .",
    "the aim of the observations was to examine the variability behavior of this source on a number of timescales , particularly the days - to - weeks timescales which have not been extensively studied in seyferts as a class .",
    "the hri data were co - added and an image was produced .",
    "the hri position for lb  1727 is ( j2000 ) @xmath82 , which agrees with the optical position to within @xmath22 .",
    "the image shows that the only x - ray sources close to lb  1727 are relatively faint ( a few per cent of the flux of lb  1727 ) .",
    "the nearest two sources are @xmath83 from the target and would be easily separable from lb  1727 in the sis images if they had a significant hard x - ray flux .    a radial profile was extracted and compared to the point - spread - function ( @xmath84 ) of the instrument . a small excess is observed over the @xmath84 , between 12 - 18@xmath85 from the centroid position .",
    "however , such an excess is commonly seen in calibration ( point ) sources .",
    "this is thought to be a deficiency in the @xmath84 model , and so we conclude there is no significant evidence for extended x - ray emission associated with lb  1727 in these data .",
    "[ fig : hri_lc ] shows a light curve based upon the _ rosat _ monitoring campaign .",
    "source counts were extracted from a circular region of radius @xmath86 encompassing 90% of the source counts .",
    "the background level was small compared to the source flux .",
    "the background has not been subtracted from the source light curve but is shown on the same plot ( rescaled to the level appropriate to the source extraction cell ) .",
    "we found no evidence for large amplitude and rapid variability in lb  1727 .",
    "rapid fluctuations at the few per cent level could be attributed to variations in the background rate .",
    "significant variations in source flux were observed on timescales of @xmath3 ks .",
    "moreover , the source flux increased by a factor of @xmath87 across the 2 month period covered by the hri observations , one of the strongest increases being a factor of two change in 5 days , close to the middle of the campaign . the amplitudes and timescales of variability seen in lb  1727 are similar to those observed in some other seyfert 1 galaxies , like mkn  335 ( turner & pounds 1988 ) .",
    "the timescales are long and the amplitude of variability is small compared to behavior observed in some nlsy1 galaxies such as mkn  478 ( marshall   1996 ) and iras 13224 - 3809 , which has shown the most extreme short time variability in x - rays ( boller  1997 ) .",
    "the known strength of the xuv flux ( e.g. marshall  1995 ) suggests we might expect to observe a strong spectral break between the soft and hard x - ray regimes in this source .",
    "there is an indication that this does indeed occur , based on the turn - up observed in the lowest channels of the sis data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : asca_rat ] ) .",
    "we fit the simultaneous hri and _ asca _ data together , and found that a simple extrapolation of the _ asca _ model significantly underpredicted the hri flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hri_asca ] ) .",
    "the key question then becomes , could the presence of ionized gas , the so - called  warm - absorber  , be the cause of the observed spectral steepening , or is that primarily due to a steepening of the continuum form .    to answer this question we fit the data using models based upon the photoionization code ion ( netzer 1996 ) .",
    "here we use the ionization parameter , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 @xmath90 is the monochromatic luminosity , @xmath91 the distance from the source to the illuminated gas .",
    "@xmath88 provides a quantity directly proportional to the level of ionization of the dominant species observed in the x - ray regime .",
    "comparison between @xmath88 , and the other ionization parameters can be found in george  ( 1998 ) , where the ion model was applied to a sample of seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "it was not possible to find an acceptable fit using a single power - law and an ionized absorber when the hri point was included in the fit ( the best - fit yielded @xmath92 which is unacceptable at @xmath93 99% confidence ) .",
    "however , the simultaneous data are adequately fit with a broken power - law model , which gives @xmath94 , @xmath95 , a break energy of @xmath96 kev and @xmath97 . thus we conclude that a steepening of the continuum is the most natural explanation for the spectral break , and complex absorbers alone can not mimic such a sharp up - turn .    despite the requirement for a steepening continuum , we can not _ rule out _ the presence of some ionized gas .",
    "if the source has a steepening continuum _ and _ is also modified by transmission through a column of ( unresolved ) ionized gas , then the observed break is a combination of two effects , a turn - up of the emission spectrum and a reduction in gas opacity at soft x - ray energies .",
    "we find the addition of a warm - absorber does not improve the fit at all , and if the gas is very highly ionized we can not constrain the amount of gas which might be present .",
    "if the ionization parameter is constrained such that @xmath98 , as it was for the seyfert 1 analysis ( george  1998 ) then we find @xmath99 ( 90% confidence ) with a lower limit @xmath100 .",
    "it is evident that large amounts of highly - ionized gas could be present but undetectable .",
    "the data are inconsistent with the screen of neutral gas of column @xmath101 estimated assuming the balmer decrement is an indicator of extinction , even if the covering fraction of the gas is allowed to be as small as 10% .",
    "the _ rosat _ pspc data are of interest with respect to the determination of the soft x - ray spectrum , in particular the energy of the spectral break .",
    "lb  1727 was observed by the",
    "pspc on 1992 april 07 .",
    "analysis of these pspc data has been presented by guainazzi  ( 1998 ) . here",
    "we present our independent analysis , which is generally consistent with that presented by guainazzi  ( 1998 ) .",
    "the data were corrected for time - dependent effects using the ftool pcpicor .",
    "source data were extracted from a cell of radius @xmath102 and background data from an annular region centered on the source .",
    "the source flux was @xmath103(0.5 - 2 kev)@xmath104 corresponding to a luminosity @xmath48 ( 0.1 - 2 kev ) @xmath105 .",
    "this flux is approximately a factor of 4 brighter than that measured by _",
    "asca _ in the same bandpass 4 years later and increased by only @xmath106 over the 40 ks separating the observation intervals comprising this dataset .",
    "the mean spectrum was fit with a simple power - law , attenuated by a neutral absorber , which was unconstrained .",
    "it was impossible to achieve an acceptable fit using this model .",
    "the data / model ratio plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rosat_rat ] , demonstrating a sharp break in the spectrum , confirming the result from the _ asca _ and hri data .",
    "application of a broken power - law model yields a rest - energy @xmath107 kev for the spectral break .",
    "the photon index above 0.7 kev is @xmath108 .",
    "the data below the break energy are not well fit with a simple power - law . in this regime ,",
    "much of the contribution to @xmath52 arises from a mixture of positive and negative data - minus - model residuals in the 0.3 - 0.4 kev regime .",
    "these may indicate the presence of emission and/or absorption features .",
    "however , this bandpass is where the effective area of the instrument has a steep gradient and modelling of features in this regime is strongly subject to any small residual inaccuracies in the area curve . _",
    "parameterizing _ this part of the spectrum with a power - law gives a photon index @xmath109 below 0.7 kev . in this case",
    "the fitted column density was @xmath110 , slightly higher than the galactic value and yielding @xmath111 .",
    "if the neutral column density is fixed at the galactic value then the soft index is found to be @xmath112 , but the fit is worse with @xmath113 .",
    "analysis of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey data ( rass ) spectrum confirms the presence of a spectral break at @xmath114 kev , and shows spectral slopes consistent with the pointed observation .    an alternative model to describe",
    "the spectral shape is that of a power - law with an absorption edge .",
    "such a fit yields @xmath115 for photon index @xmath116 and a rest - energy @xmath117 kev for an edge of depth @xmath118 .",
    "the column density was @xmath119 .",
    "again , the dominant contributions to @xmath52 are close @xmath120 kev . in this case",
    "the underlying continuum is steeper than that in the _ asca _ regime .",
    "the fit featuring an absorption edge is a superior description of the pspc data , but there is no evidence for a deep absorption feature in the 0.4 - 0.6 kev sis data ( overlaid in fig .",
    "[ fig : asca_rat ] ) .",
    "we find that the combined hri and _ asca _ data can not be described by a single power - law plus a deep absorption feature ( notch or edge ) , and an absorption feature is not required once we allow the data to be fit with a broken power - law .",
    "the pointed observation from the pspc found the source to be much brighter , and the 0.6 - 2.0 kev index much steeper than during the _ asca _ epochs .",
    "also , for all of the aforementioned fits , the pspc slope is inconsistent with the _ asca _ spectral index in the overlapping bandpass ( which is effectively 0.6 - 2.0 kev ) .",
    "this disagreement is either attributable to spectral variability of the source , or to a greater degree of inconsistency in the cross - calibration between the pspc and _ asca _ than previously thought .",
    "an astrophysical explanation might be that the soft spectral component was relatively strong during the pspc epoch , and dominated the spectrum up to a higher energy than during the _ asca _ observation . in this case",
    "one would also expect the break to move to a higher energy , which is not observed .",
    "in fig .  7 we examine the shape of the sed by utilizing the multiwaveband data compiled by grupe et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and combining our _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data with infra - red , optical fluxes and rass data .",
    "all data are corrected for known sources of absorption and the _ euve _ data represent the average flux based upon data from 1992 july through 1993 july ( marshall  1995 ; fruscione 1996 ) .",
    "the _ iue _ data were extracted from the archival observation of 1994 oct 27 .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "spectrum shows strong emission lines from ly@xmath6 and civ ( at z=0.104 ) with no evidence for absorption .",
    "the _ iue _",
    "data lie a little low compared to the _ euve _ data , however these are not simultaneous with any other dataset and large amplitude variations are a property of the xuv - bump ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "_ asca _ and pspc data are represented by pseudo - bow - ties showing the 90% confidence ranges of spectral index and folding in the ( 10% ) uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration .",
    "table [ slopes ] summarizes the spectral slopes of lb  1727 between 100 @xmath121 m and 1 kev , for comparison with those calculated for a large sample of agn as detailed in grupe  ( 1998a ) .",
    "the index between 2500  and 2 kev is also calculated , as this is widely quoted in the literature .",
    "we utilized the pspc spectrum from the pointed observation of _ rosat _ to obtain 0.25 , 1 and 2 kev flux points for index determination .",
    "the pointed data allow a more accurate determination of the fluxes than the rass data , and over a softer bandpass than the _ asca _ data .",
    "lb  1727 lies within the range of indices found between 5500  and 0.25 , 1 kev for seyfert galaxies ( grupe  1998a ) but at the extreme end of the range , indicating the source to be relatively bright in the soft x - ray band",
    ". however , we note that lb  1727 was relatively bright during the pointed pspc observation , and the derived indices are slightly shallower than they would be if we had used the rass or _ asca",
    "obviously , combining non - simultaneous data can only give an approximation to the sed , for such a variable source .",
    "the index between 2500  and 2 kev is 1.23 , if we assume a 2 kev flux a factor of four dimmer than observed during the pspc observation ( as observed by _ asca _ ) , then the index would be 1.46 .",

    "we investigated whether lb  1727 fits into the normal correlations found between parameters in other agn ( e.g. boroson & green 1992 , grupe et al .",
    "we found lb  1727 to have a relatively large ratio ` [ ` oiii`]`/h@xmath25 for a source with such a flat optical continuum slope ( grupe et al .",
    "1998b ) . using the value of x - ray index based upon a single power - law fit to the rass data ( grupe  1998a ) we find lb",
    "1727 fits into the @xmath142 - fwhm(h@xmath25 ) relationship observed for seyfert galaxies ( boller  1996 ) .",
    "if we were to use the steeper spectral index observed below 0.75 kev then this would no longer hold true . however , using parameters from the broken power - law fit would no longer yield a fair comparison with the simple indices plotted for other sources in those samples , which were fit with a single power - law model .",
    "compared to both hard and soft x - ray selected samples of agn , we find lb  1727 to be relatively weak in the ir regime ( cf .",
    "grupe  1998a ) .",
    "this is also evident by comparison of the sed with that of other hard and soft x - ray selected agn ( fig .  4 of by grupe  1998a ) .",
    "this suggests that if dust exists in this source , it is not excited by the nuclear radiation .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum of lb  1727 is flat , with @xmath143 between rest - energies @xmath144 kev , and shows no evidence for intrinsic absorption by neutral or ionized material .",
    "there are several examples of flat x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) spectra reported for seyfert galaxies ( ngc 4151 , e.g. weaver  1994 ; ngc 3227 , e.g. george  1998 , mrk  6 , george 1999 ) ; however , in most known cases these nuclei are also heavily absorbed .",
    "the observation of a flat continuum does not appear to be an artifact of confusion between continuum and compton reflection , or between continuum and a complex absorber .",
    "we added a model component representing the hard spectral feature due to compton reflection from neutral material ( magdziarz & zdziarski , 1995 ) .",
    "we found the july 1996 _ asca _ data still required a flat underlying continuum , @xmath145 , the additional component did not improve the fit at all , and gave an upper limit ( at 90% confidence ) on the solid angle of the reflector , @xmath146 ( for reflection from a disk of material observed face - on ) .",
    "for the august 1996 _ asca _ data addition of the same model component resulted in a reduction @xmath147 , and gave a solution with @xmath148 . in that case",
    "the inferred underlying index steepened to @xmath149 .",
    "thus the _ asca _ data are inconclusive on the importance of compton reflection in this source .",
    "models assuming reflection from ionized material may prove appropriate , however , given the limited bandpass of _ asca _ these data do not merit any more detailed modeling related to reflection .    allowing the presence of large amounts of absorbing material , ionized or neutral , fully or partially - covering the source , did not reveal a solution consistent with a significantly steeper continuum slope .",
    "no physical explanation has been offered linking spectral index and absorption .",
    "it is , however , plausible that the ionizing continuum could influence the condition of the line - of - sight gas and vice versa . in light of such possibilities it is interesting to find examples of flat , but apparently unabsorbed spectra .",
    "the source also shows line emission from the k - shell of iron .",
    "unfortunately there are too few line photons to constrain the ionization - state of the emitting material , or the width of the line .",
    "the requirement for a marked steepening of the soft x - ray continuum , combined with a rise in the optical continuum bluewards of @xmath150   indicates that a spectral component exists which peaks between these two extremes , the so - called xuv - bump . while this has been inferred for many seyfert galaxies in the past ( starting with arnaud  1985 ) , the discovery of the existence of large amounts of ionized gas along the line - of - sight to many seyfert nuclei ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1992 , reynolds 1997 , george  1998 ) confused the issue . in many sources ,",
    "it has become unclear whether the observed steepening to soft x - ray energies is predominantly due to the reduced opacity of ionized species below @xmath14 kev in an ionized absorber .",
    "thus the existence of an xuv - bump has been called into question ( e.g. nandra  1995 , laor  1997 ) .",
    "examination of lb  1727 shows that in this case , the xuv - bump is required , even if we allow the possibility of some attenuation by unresolved , ionized gas . assuming the nucleus is unattenuated then the spectral break is constrained ( by the combined hri and _ asca _ data ) to lie at @xmath96 kev . if ionized material is present , then , while we know that this can not produce all of the observed spectral steepening it may contribute to it . in this case",
    "the _ continuum _ break can only be constrained to lie at a rest - energy in the @xmath151  0.75 kev range ( the lower limit being given by the effective rest - energy of the lower bound of the hri bandpass ) .    while lb  1727 has spectral indices which are extreme , such properties are not unknown .",
    "the source resembles the seyfert  1 galaxy mrk  841 , which shows a two - component x - ray spectrum .",
    "the index of mrk  841 is variable in the 2  10 kev band and has been observed to be as flat as that reported here for lb  1727 ( george  1993 ) .",
    "the spectrum of mkn  841 may also steepen to lower energies , this has been suggested to be due to the presence of an xuv - bump , although , as noted above , recent analysis shows the shape of the soft x - ray spectrum could be attributable to the effects of ionized gas along the line - of - sight in that case , and the soft x - ray spectrum can be simply extrapolated to meet the uv data ( nandra  1995 ) .    in the case of lb  1727",
    ", the xuv - bump must be a source of copious ionizing photons .",
    "assuming there is no absorption between this bump component and the optical - line - emitting regions then it should have a noticible effect on optical line ratios .",
    "as discussed by cohen ( 1983 ) and kraemer  ( 1999 ) , the heii@xmath152/h@xmath25 ratio should depend strongly on the xuv spectrum .",
    "in general , examination of the narrow components of these lines is illuminating , as the narrow - line - region is free from the strong collisional effects affecting the broad - line - region .",
    "as shown by kraemer  ( 1999 ) , lb  1727 has a relatively strong heii contribution which may be linked to the presence of a strong xuv - bump .",
    "the balmer decrement determined from the sum of the broad and narrow components of h@xmath6 and h@xmath25 could be due to the presence of a column density @xmath153 along the line - of - sight .",
    "a column of ionized , dusty material would be consistent with data in both the optical and x - ray regimes .",
    "however , the sed indicates that dust is not important in this source and in any case some simpler explanations are more compelling .",
    "the lack of attenuation of the optical continuum suggests the balmer decrement is due to opacity effects in the line - emitting clouds .",
    "alternatively , the gas which obscures the regions producing optical lines may simply be out of the line - of - sight to the nucleus .",
    "while the hri and _ asca _ data have allowed us to determine that the continuum breaks to a steeper form at @xmath7 kev , we can do little to examine the detailed spectrum of the soft component .",
    "fortunately it will soon be possible to examine this interesting source with _",
    "axaf _ and _ xmm_. the high spectral resolution afforded by the _",
    "axaf _ and _ xmm _ gratings , along with their broad - bandpasses , extending down to the soft x - ray regime , allows the opportunity for a significant advance in our understanding of lb  1727 .",
    "we are grateful to  team for their operation of the satellite , to hagai netzer for use of ion and to jules halpern for very useful comments .",
