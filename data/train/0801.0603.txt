    "<S> we show that , within some modified gravity theories , such as the palatini models , the non - linear nature of the field equations implies that the usual nave averaging procedure ( replacing the microscopic energy - momentum by its cosmological average ) could be invalid . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the relative motion of particles in palatini theories is actually indistinguishable from that predicted by general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is no wep violation . </S>",
    "<S> our new and most important result is that the cosmology and astrophysics , or put more generally , the behaviours on macroscopic scales , predicted by these two theories are the same , and as a result the naturalness problems associated with the cosmological constant are not alleviated . </S>",
    "<S> palatini gravity does however predict alterations to the internal structure of particles and the particle physics laws , _ e.g. _ , corrections to the hydrogen energy levels . measurements of which place strong constraints on the properties of viable palatini gravities .    </S>",
    "<S> extensions of general relativity ( gr ) have always received a great deal of attention . </S>",
    "<S> such theories are motivated by quantum gravity models and by the wish to find phenomenological alternatives to the standard paradigm of dark matter and dark energy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> modifications to einstein gravity generally result in non - linear ( in energy momentum tensor @xmath0 ) corrections to the field equations . </S>",
    "<S> the application of these equations equations to macroscopic ( _ e.g. _ cosmological ) scales involves an implicit coarse - graining over the microscopic structure of particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , when there are extra non - linear terms in the field equations , _ a priori _ , the validity of the usual coarse - graining procedure can no longer be taken for granted , as first proposed by @xcite . hence , </S>",
    "<S> as discussed in @xcite , it may be important to take into account the microscopic structure of matter when applying the field equations to macroscopic scales .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , to date , that has not been the common practice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably because , in gr , as in newtonian gravity , the microscopic structure of matter is not particularly important on macroscopic scales . </S>",
    "<S> it is standard practice to replace the metric , @xmath1 , and the energy momentum tensor , @xmath0 , with some average of them that coarse - grains over the microscopic structure . </S>",
    "<S> this simple procedure only works , however , because on microscopic scales the equations of gr are approximately linear .    in this </S>",
    "<S> _ letter _ we show that such an approach _ can not _ simply be applied to modified gravity without a detailed first analysis of the energy - momentum microstructure . indeed , navely averaging over the microscopic structure </S>",
    "<S> will generally lead one to make incorrect predictions , and inaccurate conclusions as to the validity of the theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is possible that a theory deviates _ </S>",
    "<S> significantly _ from gr at the level of the microscopic field equations to be _ </S>",
    "<S> indistinguishable _ from the latter when correctly coarse grained over macroscopic , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , cosmological , scales .    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this point for a class of modified gravity theories in which the ricci scalar , @xmath2 , in the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by some function @xmath3 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ : @xmath4 the field equations for this action can be derived according to two _ inequivalent _ variational approaches : metric and palatini . in the former , @xmath5 and @xmath2 are taken to be constructed from the matter metric @xmath6 , which couples to matter and governs the conservation of energy momentum tensor , and the field equations are found by minimizing the action with respect to variations in @xmath7 . in the alternative , palatini approach , @xmath8 where @xmath5 is a function of some connection field @xmath9 which is , _ a priori _ , treated as being independent of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the field equations are then found by minimizing the action with respect to both @xmath9 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath10 ( _ i.e. _ gr with a cosmological constant ) then the two approaches result in the same field equations . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise they are generally different . </S>",
    "<S> note that the palatini @xmath11 field equations are mathematically equivalent to an @xmath12 brans - dicke theory with a potential , and thus represents more general modified gravity theories .    within the metric approach to the @xmath11 gravity theories , </S>",
    "<S> averaging over _ microscopic _ scales is generally no less straightforward than it is in gr ; this is because in both cases all degrees of freedom are dynamical . </S>",
    "<S> these dynamics normally ensure that the field equations , for all degrees of freedom , are approximately linear ( in energy momentum tensor @xmath0 ) on small - scale structures @xcite . in contrast , averaging in palatini models is not so trivial as the new degree of freedom is _ non - dynamical _ , and so its field equation remains non - linear ( in energy momentum tensor @xmath0 ) even on the smallest scales . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the cosmological behaviour of these theories can be very different from what has been suggested in the literature @xcite , which adopt the same averaging procedure as in the metric approach . also , </S>",
    "<S> although gr plus a cosmological constant is a special case of palatini @xmath11 ( and also of metric @xmath11 ! ) </S>",
    "<S> theories , the averaging problem for general palatini theories dose not arise there because the gr field equations are linear ( and algebraic ) in curvature @xmath2 and energy momentum tensor components , while in contrast for general palatini theories the curvature depends nonlinearly ( but also algebraically ) on energy momentum tensor . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize again that it is _ this _ `` nonlinearity '' that makes the averaging of general palatini theories not as trivial as that in gr .    </S>",
    "<S> palatini @xmath13 theories are similar to the @xmath11 ones in many aspects , but their study is more complicated . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we shall mainly focus on the latter and state the results of the former when appropriate , referring more details to @xcite . to avoid confusion later , we now take @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> varying the @xmath16 action with respect to @xmath9 gives that @xmath9 is the levi - civit@xmath17 connection of @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> varying the action with respect to @xmath7 gives : @xmath19 , \\label{eqn1}\\\\ \\kappa { \\mathcal t}^{\\mu}{}_{\\mu } & \\equiv & \\kappa \\mathcal{t}\\ = \\ f^{\\prime}(\\phi)\\phi - 2f(\\phi ) , \\label{eqn2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and : @xmath23 also @xmath24 , where @xmath25 defines @xmath26 . in @xmath13 gravity </S>",
    "<S> the field equation is similar to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn1 ] ) , but the metrics @xmath1 and @xmath6 are _ disformal _ , and @xmath27 depends _ algebraically _ on @xmath28 rather than simply on @xmath29 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to bear in mind that eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn1 ] ) and ( [ eqn2 ] ) are _ microscopic _ field equations , and they are only definitely valid when all the microscopic structure in the distribution of energy and momentum is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the cosmological and astrophysical behaviours of these theories have , to date , been studied by simply replacing @xmath1 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn1 ] , [ eqn2 ] ) by some coarse - grained averages of them @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in palatini @xmath16 theories , a deviation from gr requires that @xmath32 depends _ nonlinearly _ on @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this nonlinearity introduces an averaging problem for the palatini theories . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall show , this means that the standard averaging procedure is no longer valid and generally results in incorrect physical and mathematical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , when the microscopic structure of matter is taken into account , the late - time cosmology of essentially _ all _ @xmath16 palatini theories is indistinguishable from that of standard gr with a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that these these theories do _ not _ violate the weak equivalence principle ( wep ) . </S>",
    "<S> palatini @xmath11 gravity _ is _ however a different theory from gr and does produce alterations to microscopic particle physics that could be detected .    </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic structure of the space - time distribution of matter energy density , @xmath33 , will not affect the macroscopic , or coarse - grained , behaviour of the theory if and only if the field equations of the theory are _ linear in @xmath33_. here is a simple example : consider a region of space with average density @xmath34 and volume @xmath35 , which contains @xmath36 particles each with density @xmath37 and volume @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the space in between the particles is empty and so @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> now consider some quantity @xmath40 . inside the particles , @xmath41 and so @xmath42 ; outside @xmath43 and so @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the average value of @xmath45 ( by volume ) is : @xmath46 it is clear that , irrespective of how @xmath45 depends on @xmath33 , @xmath47 depends on @xmath48 linearly . </S>",
    "<S> thus if @xmath45 depends nonlinearly on @xmath33 , we have @xmath49 . in palatini theories </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath50 generally exhibits highly non - linear dependence on @xmath33 , and so @xmath51 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to know when navely coarse - grained equations are valid to a good approximation over the length scales and density scales where we have observations . </S>",
    "<S> this only occurs in palatini theories when the inherently nonlinear modifications to gr have sub - leading effect . in all these cases the theory will reduce to gr up to the order where the navely coarse - grained equations are valid . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we are concerned with the how palatini theories deviate from gr , even when those deviations are sub - leading order </S>",
    "<S> . we must then always take account of those nonlinear terms in the equations which determine how palatini theories deviate from gr . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial rle played by these nonlinear terms means that the nave coarse - graining procedure will always fail to accurately describe the differences between palatini theories and gr .    to uncover how palatini gravities behave on macroscopic scales , we consider how a set of microscopic particles evolve under such a modified gravity . </S>",
    "<S> consider a single , spherical particle for which @xmath52 for @xmath53 but vanishes otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the metric for such a particle is @xcite : @xmath54 with @xmath55 , \\label{gmass } \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\chi & = & \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\int_{r_p}^{r } { { \\rm d}}r^{\\prime}\\ , r^{\\prime}\\frac{(\\rho + p_i+p_{a})}{w(r^{\\prime } ) f^{\\prime\\,2}(\\phi)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the anisotropic stress satisfying @xmath60 . in the rest frame of the particle @xmath61 the presentation of this solution in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was , however , incomplete as it failed to note that the @xmath62 component of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn1 ] ) results in the condition : @xmath63 where @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 eq .  ( [ volk ] ) implies that at @xmath67 one has @xmath68 .    outside the particle , @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath71 and so the metric is precisely that of a schwarzschild de - sitter spacetime with gravitational mass @xmath72 and an effective cosmological constant @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar schwarzschild de - sitter solution is found for the palatini @xmath13 case @xcite , with @xmath27 replaced by a more complicated function of @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we see that in palatini models the external metric of a single particle is precisely what it would be in general relativity with a cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> we now consider a spacetime containing many such particles . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath75 to be the position of a particle @xmath76 and @xmath77 . making a weak field approximation with respect to @xmath1 and using the above solution </S>",
    "<S> , we find that inside the particle labeled @xmath78 and to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 : @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 ; @xmath84 is the active gravitational mass of each particle given by @xmath85 .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath86 be the 4-velocity of the @xmath87 particle which satisfies @xmath88 . to the order @xmath89 , @xmath90 now @xmath31 is conserved with respect to @xmath7 _ i.e. _ @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> evaluating this equation at the centre of the particle we have @xmath92 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the proper time along the worldline of the particle , and so @xmath95 ( because the metric @xmath96 means @xmath97 \\approx\\frac{1}{f'^{2}}(dt / d\\tau)^{2}$ ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the internal configuration of the particle can be static or non - static , and here for simplicity we assume it to be static and will comment on the non - static case below . </S>",
    "<S> this requires that all gradients in @xmath30 cancel with gradients in the pressure and also that @xmath29 and hence @xmath30 are conserved along particle worldlines , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath98 . equation ( [ eu ] ) is then equivalent to : @xmath99 the acceleration with respect to @xmath94 depends both on the gravitational field , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration measured with respect to @xmath102 , however , depends only on @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative acceleration of two particles labeled @xmath103 and @xmath104 as measured by a third , labeled @xmath105 say , with proper time @xmath106 is therefore : @xmath107 where @xmath108 . in a uniform gravitational field : @xmath109 and </S>",
    "<S> so @xmath110 it follows that an observer ( _ i.e. _  particle @xmath105 ) sees any two other particles , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , accelerate at the same rate in a uniform gravitational field . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely what is required by the weak equivalence principle .    </S>",
    "<S> since the internal configuration of the particles is static and the centres of two particles do not have relative acceleration , there will be no relative acceleration between the two whole particles . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was suggested that internal gradients in @xmath30 would lead to wep violations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , because those gradients all vanish outside the particle , they can not affect the overall motion of the particle @xcite ( this is related to the fact that the extra force , which arises due to the modification to gr , has zero range ; as we shall discuss in more detail below ) . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , hydrostatic equilibrium , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ volk ] ) , ensures that gradients in @xmath30 are cancelled by pressure gradients .    </S>",
    "<S> the absence of wep violation in the dynamics of particles ensures that the inertial and passive gravitational mass of particles are equal . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the inertial mass and the active gravitational mass of particles are also equal in these theories . </S>",
    "<S> let us define @xmath111 by the modified einstein equation , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn1 ] ) , and the contracted bianchi identity : @xmath112 where @xmath113 . outside an isolated particle @xmath114 and , as we have seen above , the metric @xmath115 outside this quasi - static ( _ i.e. _ @xmath116 ) isolated particle is schwarzschild - de - sitter . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , tolman shows that , under these conditions , the inertial and active gravitational mass of an isolated ( not necessarily spherically symmetric ) system are equal ( see also @xcite ) . for our particles , the inertial , </S>",
    "<S> passive and active gravitational mass are therefore equal to @xmath117 where by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gmass ] ) : @xmath118.\\ ] ] this equivalence holds for particles both in gr and in palatini @xmath119 theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the motion of isolated particles ( situated in a vacuum ) in palatini theories is exactly the same as it is in gr with @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> this has a very simple physical explanation . in all modified gravity theories </S>",
    "<S> one may think of the modifications as being due to some new , effective force . </S>",
    "<S> in palatini theories , there is no extra dynamical degree of freedom , so this ` new ' force is also non - dynamical , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , does not propagate and only acts at points . the closest analogue to this in particle physics </S>",
    "<S> would be fermi s original proposal for a theory of the weak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the effective new force is entirely _ local _ and depends on gradients in the @xmath29 or @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore no way for one isolated particle to influence the motion of another , and the force simply vanishes in a vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the effective force will alter the internal configuration of the particle nonetheless , but this will not effect the motion of the particle as a whole . note that the above discussion relies on the specific model for the matter distribution in a system . in most systems it is realistic to take the matter as to be distributed in localized clumps ( what we refer to as particles ) which only interact with each other gravitationally ( or through extra forces due to the modification of gravity , which as we said above is of zero range and thus completely irrelevant for classical particles ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the extreme environments like a neutron star , however , the energy density is of order nuclear density , and there is essentially no space between different particles so that the above matter model breaks down : in this case we expect the nave averaging procedure to be applicable . </S>",
    "<S> for cosmology and most other astrophysical systems our averaging is nonetheless more realistic . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the absence of wep violation does not require the internal configuration of the particles is static ( as we have assumed ) . </S>",
    "<S> rather , it is a result of the fact that the extra force has zero range so that there is no composition - dependent extra force between different particles which do not overlap with each other </S>",
    "<S> . additionally palatini @xmath11 theories are equivalent to a generalized brans - dicke , and , in common with other brans - dicke theories , the extra force has no composition dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> we now apply our results to a cosmological setting . at late times and on a microscopic level , most matter in the universe </S>",
    "<S> is made up of small particles and a bit of radiation . in @xmath16 theories , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath122 for radiation and so the presence of radiation does not alter the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath29 . our analysis is therefore directly applicable to this setting . the universe must therefore evolve precisely as it would in gr with a cosmological constant @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in an alternative manner : averaging eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eins ] ) over volume @xmath35 containing @xmath36 particles with mass @xmath117 and using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ avgeqn ] ) we find @xmath123 using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ volk ] ) we find that in the rest frame of the particle @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> more generally then @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the relative particle velocity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when correctly coarse - grained over cosmological scales , @xmath127 describes a collisionless dust ; we have assumed that the peculiar velocities , @xmath128 , of the particles are small and dropped terms of @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological evolution of the universe in such theories is therefore precisely the same as it is in gr with a cosmological constant @xmath73 and a dust with energy density @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> this argument also holds for most astrophysical systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , solar system tests are evaded and the parametrized post - newtonian parameters are indistinguishable from those of gr .    </S>",
    "<S> many of the predictions made in the literature ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) do not , therefore , follow from a palatini @xmath16 model , but may still be correct for some other modified gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> any such theory would , however , likely be subject to additional constraints from local tests of gravity .    despite of their similar behaviours , palatini @xmath16 gravities and gr </S>",
    "<S> are not equivalent . even though motions of isolated bodies are the same in both theories , the internal structure and dynamics of them are generally different @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , for the body to be stable under gravity one must require that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ volk ] ) holds , and the appearance of @xmath131 in this equation clearly indicates an alteration to gr . as we mentioned above , the pressure gradients inside the particle must be modified with respect to those in gr in order to exactly cancel the gradients in @xmath30 , and so we expect the distributions of matter inside this particle , that is , the internal structures , according to these two theories to be different .    as another example </S>",
    "<S> , the electron energy levels in atoms are altered in palatini @xmath16 theories ( see also @xcite for a recent work ) . </S>",
    "<S> such alterations occur , because in these theories the effective electron mass depends on the electron density , and so is different for different energy levels . in the absence of any palatini modification , we define the energy and number density of an electron with total angular momentum @xmath132 , in energy level @xmath133 , to be : @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively where @xmath136 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath137 the electron mass . in palatini </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 theories , the electron mass depends on @xmath30 and hence on the electron density which is different for different values of @xmath133 and @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath138 so that the density dependence of the electron mass is slight . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of an electron ( up to an overall constant ) is then @xcite : @xmath139 where @xmath140 for some @xmath141 and to leading order in @xmath142 : @xmath143 where @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in palatini theories determinations of the electron mass from transitions between different energy levels using the standard formula for @xmath145 would find different answers for each transition unless @xmath146 ; this possibility is however very strongly constrained . </S>",
    "<S> so far both @xmath147 and @xmath141 have only been defined up to an overall constant _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath148 , @xmath149 for some constant @xmath150 is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the definition of @xmath141 , and hence also @xmath147 , so @xmath141 is the effective electron mass for the ground state _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> using measurements of the electron mass from the transitions 1s-2s and 2s-8d @xcite we have @xmath152 respectively for @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 states the values of @xmath156 near the expected electron radius are : @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 . </S>",
    "<S> if , for instance , @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the value of the cosmological constant today , eq . ( [ bound ] ) gives the very strong constraint : @xmath162    in summary , much of our intuition about how the microscopic behaviour of gravity affects physics on large scales is based upon einstein s general relativity . in this _ </S>",
    "<S> letter _ we show that such an intuition _ can not _ simply be generalized to modified gravity theories without a detailed analysis of the energy - momentum microstructure . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , navely averaging over the microscopic structure will generally lead to incorrect predictions , and inaccurate conclusions as to the validity of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the nave averaging procedure is _ invalid _ in palatini theories . </S>",
    "<S> a correct averaging procedure shows that the cosmology of palatini @xmath11 models is identical to that of gr and fine tuning problems associated with the cosmological constant are neither alleviated nor , it should be said , worsened . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the relative motion of particles in palatini theories is indistinguishable from that predicted by gr . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , although palatini @xmath11 theories were designed to modify gravity on large scales , they actually modify physics on the smallest scales ( _ e.g. _ the energy levels of electrons ) leaving the larger scales practically unaltered . in general , before considering any astrophysical consequences of a modified gravity theory , it is important then to check that it does not make unrealistic predictions for atomic physics </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> one may wonder whether similar problems arise in the metric @xmath11 gravity theories . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> we have been concerned with averaging over very small scales ( e.g. atomic scales ) . in the metric @xmath11 theories , </S>",
    "<S> the extra scalar degree of freedom is _ dynamical _ and so it can and does propagate . </S>",
    "<S> this means that its dependence on the distribution of matter is not so rigid as in palatini theories . over the very small scales of particles , although the energy density of matter might change rapidly ( from nuclear density inside the particles to zero outside ) , the extra scalar degree of freedom @xmath30 is not required to change so abruptly . in metric @xmath11 theories , </S>",
    "<S> the field equation for @xmath30 has the form : @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the pressure of matter and @xmath33 its energy density . </S>",
    "<S> over very small scales , the kinetic term ( @xmath165 ) dominates over the potential term ( @xmath166 ) and so reduces to @xmath167 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that over small scales the leading order deviation from gr , determined by @xmath30 , obeys a linear second order differential equation . in palatini theories </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath30 is related algebraically to @xmath168 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath30 depends _ algebraically _ and _ linearly _ on @xmath168 , we reduce to gr . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that in palatini theories the leading order deviation from gr is necessarily determined by a non - linear algebraic relation to @xmath168 .    </S>",
    "<S> one may think of metric @xmath11 theories as being scalar - tensor theories with a gravitational strength coupling to matter , and palatini theories as being ones with an essentially infinite strength coupling to matter ( in this sense they also have an infinite mass , but the ratio of the mass to the coupling is finite ) . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers a general scalar - tensor theory with arbitrary strength coupling ( but defined so that the mass divided by the coupling is fixed ) then one would expect to see a cross - over , for some coupling strength , from a behaviour where the macroscopic dynamics are determined , to leading order , by the microscopic field equations ( and averaging works as one might expect ) , to a behaviour where the average macroscopic dynamics are _ not _ described by the microscopic field equations . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the behaviour that was found in the study conducted in @xcite . for a relatively weak ( e.g. gravitational strength ) coupling , such as in metric @xmath11 theories , </S>",
    "<S> averaging over small scales works as one would generally expect ( at least to determine the leading order deviation from gr ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed though that these problems with averaging may re - emerge in metric @xmath11 on larger scales ( e.g. those of large scale structure in the universe ) . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of this scenario is beyond the scope of this article .    </S>",
    "<S> another point worthy of discussion is that the conclusions of this paper concerning the macroscopic behaviour of palatini @xmath11 theories applies generally well to much wider class of theories . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for a given theory on can always write ( for a some choice of conformal frame ) the modified einstein equations as : @xmath169 where @xmath170 is some cosmological constant term , @xmath171 is the energy momentum tensor of matter and @xmath172 represents all of the modifications from the standard einstein equation . </S>",
    "<S> all of our conclusions of the macroscopic behaviour of palatini @xmath11 theories , will then apply if , for some choice of @xmath170 , both terms on the right hand side of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ modeqn ] ) vanish outside particles . </S>",
    "<S> one could then replace @xmath173 by @xmath174 , and this new energy momentum tensor would then only have support where @xmath175 i.e. if @xmath175 describes a system of particles separated by vacuum then so does @xmath176 . in any such theory , one could , as is done in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , deduce the dynamics of particles , and hence the averaged dynamics of a set of particles , simply by considering surface integrals which depend only on the form of the metric outside the particles . outside the particles , the field equations in this modified theory reduce to @xmath177 i.e. just vacuum gr . in this modified theory </S>",
    "<S> , particles in a vacuum would therefore move precisely like particles in a vacuum in gr . since the motion of such particles in the later does not dependent on the precise composition of the particles , it is essentially irrelevant that we have replaced the original matter energy momentum tensor with a modified one . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to see that if the motion of particles is equivalent to that in gr for one choice of conformal frame , it is equivalent for all choices of conformal frame . </S>"
