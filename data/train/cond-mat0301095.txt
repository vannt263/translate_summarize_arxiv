    "the exciting collective magnetic properties of layered cuprates have attracted much attention over the last decade .",
    "a lot of activity in this field was stimulated by the possible connection of spin fluctuations with the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "but , the rather unusual properties of quantum magnets deserve study on their own to gain a deeper understanding of these quantum many - body systems . in recent years",
    "some of those materials such as @xmath6 and @xmath7 have been studied experimentally and theoretically in more detail @xcite . the most important difference between @xmath0 and their parent compound",
    "@xmath8 is the existence of additional @xmath9-atoms located at the centre of every second @xmath10-plaquette .",
    "both subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 form square lattices , however , with different orientations and lattice constants .",
    "this a - b lattice is illustrated in fig.[fig1]a .",
    "both copper sites @xmath10 and @xmath9 carry spin half , i.e. quantum fluctuations are important .",
    "since the magnetic couplings @xmath3 between a spins as well as @xmath4 between b spins are antiferromagnetic and the coupling @xmath5 between a and b spins is frustrating we have a system of two competing antiferromagnetic spin - half subsystems .",
    "three - dimensional examples of two interpenetrating antiferromagnets like garnets @xmath11 or @xmath12 were discussed by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for the quasi two - dimensional cuprates like @xmath0 the quantum fluctuations are more important than in the three - dimensional garnets and the interplay of competing interactions with strong quantum fluctuations may lead to interesting magnetic phenomena .",

    "@xcite reported two magnetic phase transitions at @xmath13 and at @xmath14 for @xmath15 being attributed to respective antiferromagnetic ordering of the @xmath10 and @xmath9 spins .",
    "both critical temperatures differ in one order of magnitude indicating a strongly antiferromagnetic coupling between @xmath10 spins and a comparatively small antiferromagnetic coupling between @xmath9 spins , which is confirmed by band - structure calculations @xcite . according to chou _",
    "_ @xcite the weak ferromagnetic moment found experimentally @xcite could be understood as a consequence of bond - dependent interactions such as pseudodipolar couplings .",
    "the minimal model to describe the main magnetic properties of the competing antiferromagnets on the a - b lattice is the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model with three exchange couplings @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in what follows",
    "we call this model a - b model .",
    "some preliminary results for a finite system of @xmath16 sites were reported in the conference paper @xcite",
    ". however , to describe the weak ferromagnetism observed in these compounds anisotropic interactions seem to be needed @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we want to study the influence of strong quantum fluctuations and frustration on the ground state of the a - b model using spin - wave theory and exact diagonalization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ ii ] we introduce the a - b model and illustrate the classical magnetic ground - state phases in the considered parameter region . in section [ iii ]",
    "we present an exact - diagonalization study of the ground - state phases and in section [ iv ] the linear spin - wave approach is used to analyse the nel phase realized for small @xmath5 in more detail . in section [ v ]",
    "a summary is given .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian ( cf . fig . [ fig1]b ) @xmath17 where the sums run over neighbouring sites only . @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the antiferromagnetic couplings within the @xmath18-subsystems , respectively .",
    "we focus our discussion on parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 which corresponds to the situation in @xmath0 .",
    "the value of the frustrating inter - subsystem coupling @xmath5 is less reliably known .",
    "we consider antiferromagnetic @xmath5 and use it as the free parameter of the model .",
    "the lattice consists of @xmath21 spins with three spins per geometrical unit cell and ten couplings in it .",
    "we start with the discussion of the classical ground state , i.e. the spins @xmath22 are considered as classical vectors of length @xmath23 .",
    "varying @xmath5 we have altogether five ground - state phases , see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "two of them ( i and iii ) have planar spin arrangement , two ( ii and iv ) are non - planar and one ( v ) is collinear . without loss of generality we choose in this section for the description of planar spin ordering the x - y plane .",
    "we start from weak inter - subsystem coupling @xmath24 .",
    "then we have nel ordering in both subsystems ( phase i , table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "these two classical nel states shown in fig.[fig1b ] are decoupled and can rotate freely with respect to each other , i.e. the ground state is highly degenerated and this degree of freedom is parametrized by the angle @xmath25 .",
    "the corresponding magnetic unit cell contains six spins .",
    "( thus , later in section [ iv ] we have to introduce six different magnons in the spin - wave theory for this phase . )    at @xmath26 there is a first - order transition from the nel phase i to the non - planar ground - state phase ii .",
    "phase ii is illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the corresponding magnetic unit cell contains 12 pins and is therefore twice as large as the magnetic unit cell of the nel phase i. in this state we have eight different spin orientations characterized as follows @xmath27 where @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 .",
    "obviously neighbouring b spins are perpendicular to each other and consequently the energy @xmath30 is independent of @xmath4 ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the in - plane xy components of the a spins of neigboring spins are also perpendicular , however , there are finite off - plane z components .",
    "these off - plane components ( proportional to @xmath31 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) ) decrease with @xmath5 and become zero at @xmath32 , i.e. we have a second - order transition from the non - planar phase ii to the planar phase iii at this point .",
    "the spin orientations of phase iii are given by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , too , but with the additional condition @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in phase",
    "iii neighbouring @xmath1-spins as well as neighbouring @xmath2-spins are perpendicular to each other and consequently the energy depends on @xmath5 only .",
    "all three phases i , ii , iii have a zero net magnetization @xmath34 .    further increasing @xmath5 favours an antiparallel alignment of the a spins relative to the b spins and the planar phase iii gives way to a non - planar phase iv where the in - plane xy components are aligned as in phases ii and iii ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the off - plane z components in phase iv are given as @xmath35 for a spins and as @xmath36 for b spins .",
    "this phase iv can be denoted as canted ferrimagnet @xcite and has a net magnetic moment @xmath37 in the a subsystem and @xmath38 in the b subsystem resulting in a finite total magnetic moment @xmath39 @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 this total moment increases with @xmath5 .",
    "the energy of phase iv is given by @xmath43 the phase boundary of the second order phase transition between iii and iv is given by @xmath44 and yields @xmath45 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "finally , for large @xmath5 the a and b spins are fully polarized along the z axis , i.e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 and a collinear ferrimagnetic phase v is realized .",
    "the phase boundary of this second order phase transition between iv and v is given by @xmath48 leading to @xmath49 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "to discuss the influence of quantum fluctuations on the classical phases studied in the last section we use the lanczos algorithm to calculate the quantum ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) for a finite lattice of @xmath50 spins ( fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "again we choose the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 appropriate for @xmath0 and consider @xmath5 as the free parameter . for @xmath16 sites we have @xmath51 @xmath1 spins and @xmath52 @xmath2 spins .",
    "since the maximal magnetic unit cell of the classical ground states contains @xmath53 spins the @xmath16 system has the full symmetry of the classical ground state in the considered parameter region . to reduce the hilbert space we used all possible translational and point symmetries of the a - b lattice as well as spin inversion .",
    "the use of the symmetry allows to classify the different quantum ground states by their symmetry .    to compare classical and quantum ground - state phases we present the spin - spin correlations in figs .",
    "[ figed2 ] , [ figed3 ] and [ figed4 ] .",
    "the nel phase i is present also in the quantum model .",
    "however , the quantum fluctuations lift the classical degeneracy and both subsystems couple .",
    "the fluctuational coupling is known as _ order from disorder _",
    "effect @xcite and selects a collinear quantum state with a finite a - b spin correlation in the quantum nel phase i ( see fig .",
    "[ figed4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the transition to phase ii is shifted to higher values of @xmath5 indicating that quantum fluctuations favour collinear versus non - collinear states ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the frustrating coupling weakens the a - a and b - b spin correlations in the nel phase i ; this weakening is stronger for the b - b correlations than for the a - a correlations .",
    "hence , a disordered quantum ground state similar to the @xmath54 model @xcite seems to be possible and will be discussed in more detail in next section .",
    "the quantum nel phase gives way to a fairly complex spin state at @xmath55 up to @xmath56 .",
    "this state is also a singlet @xmath57 as the quantum nel state .",
    "the a - a and the a - b spin correlations of the quantum model follow qualitatively the classical curves ( see figs .",
    "[ figed2 ] and [ figed4 ] ) .",
    "however , we see some jumps in the correlations connected with level crossings of ground states belonging to different lattice symmetries .",
    "most likely these level crossings may be attributed to finite - size effects .",
    "the change of a - a and a - b correlations at @xmath55 is small .",
    "however , the b - b correlations change strongly at this point .",
    "contrary to the classical model where the nearest - neighbour b - b correlation is zero and the next - nearest - neighbour b - b correlation is strongly antiferromagnetic .",
    "the corresponding correlations in the quantum model are both different from zero and are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "one could argue that quantum fluctuations favour planar versus non - planar arrangement of spins .",
    "this argument is supported by ( i ) the circumstance that there is a planar classical state of almost the same energy as the non - planar state having finite nearest - neighbour b - b correlations and ( ii ) by investigation of the so - called scalar chirality @xmath58 being nonzero only in non - planar states .",
    "this kind of order parameter was widely discussed for the @xmath54 model @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath59 as the running index and consider for @xmath60 sites forming an equilateral triangle like sites 1 , 23 , 24 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , i.e. we have @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then we use as order parameter ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a staggered factor being @xmath65 on sublattice @xmath66 ( i.e. sites 17 , 19 , 21 , 23 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and @xmath67 on sublattice @xmath68 ( i.e. sites 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . as shown by fig .",
    "[ figed5 ] this chirality is indeed large in the classical nonplanar states but we do not see significantly enhanced chiral correlations in the quantum ground state .    further increasing @xmath5 leads to a transition from the complex singlet @xmath57 phase directly to an @xmath69 phase at @xmath56 , which is the quantum counterpart to the classical canted ferrimagnetic phase iv .",
    "this transition is very close to the classical transition iii - iv which is also a transition from zero @xmath39 to finite @xmath39 .",
    "the last transition is that to the collinear ferrimagnetic state with @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "this value is significantly smaller than the corresponding classical value , again indicating that quantum fluctuations favour collinear spin ordering leading to an enlarged stability region of the collinear ferrimagnetic phase .",
    "notice , that the additional jump just before the last transition is attributed to a change in total spin @xmath72 from @xmath69 to @xmath73 corresponding to the increase of @xmath39 in the classical phase iv .",
    "one characteristics of both ferrimagnetic ( @xmath74 ) phases are the positive correlations within a subsystem ( see figs .",
    "[ figed2 ] and [ figed3 ] ) but negative correlations between the subsystems ( see fig .",
    "[ figed4 ] ) .",
    "the parameters for which the nel phase i is realized most likely correspond to the situation in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we present a more detailed analysis of the magnetic ordering of this phase using a linear spin - wave theory . within this approach",
    "we calculate the excitation spectrum , the order parameter as well as the spin - wave velocity .    as usual",
    "we perform holstein - primakoff transformation . because the magnetic unit cell contains six spins we need at least six different types of magnons being distinguished by a running index as illustrated in ( fig.[fig1b ] ) . after transforming into the @xmath75-space the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) reads @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath79 is the number of geometrical unit cells @xmath80 .",
    "the vectors @xmath81 are the unit vectors of the geometrical lattice : @xmath82 and @xmath83 and @xmath84 is the lattice constant ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "@xmath85 is defined as @xmath86 , where @xmath25 parametrizes the angle between the nel states of the classical subsystems a and b. without any further calculation it is obvious that quantum fluctuations stabilize collinear ordering . according to the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite the relation @xmath87 holds , where @xmath88 is a hamiltonian depending on a parameter @xmath89 and @xmath90 is an eigenvalue of @xmath88 .",
    "because ( [ eq6 ] ) depends on @xmath91-terms only one finds @xmath92 being zero for @xmath93 , i.e. as discussed already above in the quantum system the classical degeneracy is lifted and collinear spin structures are preferred .",
    "thus , all quantities have to be calculated as averages over both possible ground states belonging to @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the diagonalization of the bosonic hamiltonian is carried out as usual by means of green functions . as it should be there are six non - degenerated spin - wave branches - two of them are optical whereas the remaining ones are two acoustical branches per subsystem .",
    "the acoustical branches become zero in the center of the brillouin zone , only . expanding these branches in the vicinity of @xmath96",
    "gives two different spin - wave velocities @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath99 where the two acoustical branches belonging to the same subsystem have identical spin - wave velocities . at the classical phase - transition point",
    "@xmath100 @xmath98 becomes zero wheras @xmath101 remains finite .",
    "+ the ground - state energy @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 and the sublattice magnetizations is calculated by @xmath104 for @xmath1-spins as well as for @xmath2-spins .",
    "the results of the spin - wave calculation for the relevant parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are presented in figs .",
    "[ figsw1 ] and [ figsw2 ] .",
    "we start with the ground - state energy shown in fig.[figsw1 ] . while the classical energy in phase i is independent of @xmath5",
    "we find a slight decrease with @xmath5 in the quantum model .",
    "for comparison we show the exact - diagonalization and the spin - wave results for @xmath16 .",
    "the difference is small ( @xmath105 for @xmath106 ) indicating that linear spin - wave theory seems to be well appropriate for phase i.    the spin - wave theory allows to calculate the corresponding sublattice magnetizations @xmath107 and @xmath108 in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 subsystems for @xmath109 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figsw2 ] .",
    "although @xmath107 is slightly diminished with growing @xmath5 the nel order of the @xmath1 subsystem is stable within the limits of the classical phase i. contrary to that the nel order of the @xmath2 subsystem is stronger suppressed and breaks down at @xmath110 .",
    "this finding is supported by the ed results for the spin - spin correlations ( see fig .",
    "[ figed6 ] ) , where we see also a stronger suppressing of b - b correlations with growing @xmath5 than of a - a correlations .",
    "hence we argue that the strong quantum fluctuations in the spin - half model in combination with strong frustration may lead to a novel ground - state phase with nel ordering in the @xmath1 subsystem but quantum disorder in the b subsystem . a similar observation recently has been made for the frustrated square - lattice @xmath54 spin - one spin - half ferrimagnet , where for strong frustration the spin - half subsystem might be disordered but the spin - one subsystem is ordered @xcite .",
    "in this paper the results of exact diagonalization and linear spin - wave theory for the ground state of a system of two interpenetrating spin - half heisenberg antiferromagnets on square lattices are presented .",
    "we consider intra - subsystem couplings of different strength @xmath111 which correponds to the situation in @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to strong quantum fluctuations there is a competing inter - subsystem coupling @xmath5 between both spin systems giving rise to interesting frustration effects .",
    "the classical version of our model possesses a rich magnetic phase diagram with collinear , planar and non - planar ground states .",
    "quantum fluctuations may change the ground - state phases .",
    "in particular , we find indications for preferring collinear versus non - collinear and planar versus non - planar phases by quantum fluctuations .    for small @xmath5",
    "both spin subsystems are in the nel state .",
    "these nel states decouple classically .",
    "quantum fluctuations lead to a fluctuational coupling of both subsystems . with increasing @xmath5",
    "the frustration tends to destroy the nel ordering of the weaker coupled @xmath2 subsystem but not in the stronger coupled @xmath1 subsystem .",
    "the comparison between exact finite - size data and approximate spin - wave data gives a good agreement between both approaches .",
