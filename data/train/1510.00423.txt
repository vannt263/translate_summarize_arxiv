    "the ising model is certainly one of the most intensively studied models in statistical mechanics .",
    "it provides a wealth of possible behaviours and serves also as a testing ground of various approximate or numerical methods .",
    "in addition to describing the properties of magnets or a liquid - gas phase transition , it also finds more exotic applications in socio- or econophysics  @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that our decisions ( buy or sell ) , preferences ( republicans or democrats ) or attitudes ( optimistic , pessimistic ) very often can be ( approximately ) represented in terms of some two - state variables .",
    "thus , certain aspects of a social system or a financial market can be modeled using some kind of ising - like systems .",
    "not surprisingly , many versions of this model were proposed and studied .",
    "an interesting class of models consists of ising models on directed networks .",
    "since social or economical links are often unsymmetric , an interest in directed models stems mainly from such nonphysical applications .",
    "the ising models on directed lattices are much different from their undirected versions even at the very basic level .",
    "indeed , for the latter ones a detailed balance is satisifed and in the steady state they are described by the well - known equilibrium hamiltonians . for directed ising models",
    "the detailed balance is not satisifed and such models have only dynamical meaning  @xcite ( nevertheless , in some cases one can find that the steady state is described by certain equilibrium boltzmann - gibbs distributions  @xcite ) .",
    "since ising model plays a fundamental role in statistical mechanics , it would be certainly desirable to understand the behaviour of its versions on directed networks .",
    "monte carlo simulations of lima and stauffer suggest that on directed regular lattices the behaviour is much different from its undirected counterpart  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the square ( directed ) lattice ising model seems to be disordered at any positive temperature and such behaviour is suggested also for higher dimensional models .",
    "their conclusion in the case of the square lattice is confirmed with the ( exact ! ) analysis by godrche and bray , who confirmed the absence of finite temperature ferromagnetism  @xcite .",
    "however , their analysis of the ising model on the directed cayley tree suggests that three- and higher - dimensional models might have a sufficiently large branching number to support a finite - temperature ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "taking into account interdisciplinary applications of the ising model , it is interesting to examine its behaviour also on heterogenenous networks .",
    "such networks include random graphs , scale - free networks or small worlds and one expects that they provide more realistic description of social or economic systems  @xcite .",
    "while undirected ising models on such networks are relatively well understood  @xcite , the behaviour of their directed counterparts remains to a large extent unknown .",
    "some studies predict that the ising model on a directed random graph undergoes a phase transition , which should be basically similar to its undirected analogoue  @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of an ising model on scale - free networks considerable differences between directed and undirected versions were reported .",
    "in particular , while for the ising model on undirected barabsi - albert network the critical temperature increases logarithmically with the network size  @xcite , the directed version most likely remains disordered at any positive temperature  @xcite .",
    "let us notice , however , that barabsi - albert network is only a particular case of scale - free networks .",
    "ising model on such systems exhibits a rich critical behaviour , but so far mainly the undirected version was examined @xcite .    trying to understand the behaviour of ising models on directed networks",
    ", we might perhaps find it instructive to compare it with some other phenomena , which take place on such networks .",
    "the simplest and most natural candidate is percolation . in the case of undirected random graphs",
    ", it was shown that the emergence of a spanning cluster coincides with the emergence of ferromagnetic solutions of the corresponding ising model  @xcite .",
    "in other words , percolating cluster provides a sufficiently strong support for the finite - temperature ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "it would be interesting to examine whether models on directed networks have a similar property .    in the present paper",
    "we examine the ising model on several directed lattices .",
    "our simulations on regular lattices show that ising models on triangular and simple cubic lattices have a finite critical temperature and the critical point most likely belongs to the ( equilibrium ) ising model universality class .",
    "this conclusion is based on the values of two critical exponents .",
    "moreover , simulations confirm that on the directed square lattice the ising model remains disordered at any positive temperature .",
    "we also analyse the ising model on directed heterogeneous random graphs and show that in this case the emergence of a percolating cluster does not guarantee a ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "such behaviour is different from the behaviour of undirected random graphs .",
    "additionally , we analyse the zero temperature freezing and show that also in this case some differences between directed and undirected graphs are present .",
    "moreover , we show that the behaviour of the ising model on heterogeneous random graphs to a remarkable accuracy can be reproduced within an approximate scheme that assumes some simplified form of a certain probability distribution of spin variables .",
    "finally , we discuss the behaviour of the ising model on a class of directed random graphs subject to the constraint that the number of out - links is constant . in this case",
    "both magnetic and percolative properties can be analysed exactly .",
    "in the present paper we examine the ising model that is a collection of spin variables @xmath0 located at the sites @xmath1 of a certain directed lattice .",
    "the spin variables evolve according to the heat - bath dynamics ; at each elementary step , we select randomly a site @xmath2 and set the corresponding variable @xmath3 with probability @xmath4 while with probability @xmath5 , we set @xmath6 . the parameter @xmath7 might be interpreted as the temperature and the summation in eq .",
    "( [ heat - bath ] ) includes all sites @xmath8 for which there is an out - link from @xmath2 to @xmath9 .",
    "a unit of simulation time ( @xmath10 ) is defined as @xmath11 elementary steps ( i.e. , during a unit of time each spin is updated once , on average ) .",
    "starting from a certain initial configuration , we let the system to reach the stationary state and then measure the magnetization @xmath12 and its variance @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the time average during monte carlo simulations . using the relation which is valid for equilibrium systems , we will refer to the variance @xmath15 as a the susceptibility , even though , as we mentioned , our system is non - equilibrium .",
    "however , we will present some evidence that @xmath15 indeed behaves similarly to the susceptibility in equilibrium models .      as a first example we analysed the ising model on a directed square lattice of linear size @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . at each site",
    "links point toward up and right neighbours , i.e. , these are the only neighbours that have an influence on a given site ( fig .",
    "[ lattice]a ) . the same orientation of bonds was used in some previous works on basically the same model  @xcite . and",
    "similarly to the previous works , our simulations suggest that the model does not show ferromagnetic ordering most likely at any positive temperature .",
    "we made simulations for system sizes up to @xmath18 and even for very low temperatures we did not observe a stable magnetization ( instead , the system frequently jumps between the states of positive and negative magnetization ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the susceptibility @xmath15 provides an additonal confirmation of the lack of ferromagnetic ordering ( fig .",
    "[ suscsq ] ) . indeed ,",
    "the arrhenius behaviour @xmath19 , over nearly three decades of  @xmath15 , suggests the absence of a finite - temperature ferromagnetic phase ( a similar behaviour is obtained , e.g. , for the @xmath20 equilibrium ising model ) .         as a function of @xmath21 for the directed square lattice model",
    "a nearly linear dependence supports the relation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a certain constant . ]",
    "it was suggested that the absence of the ferromagnetic ordering for the directed square lattice could be attributed to the violation of the action - reaction principle  @xcite .",
    "namely , on our directed lattices @xmath24 affects @xmath25 but not _ vice versa_. simulations for the directed triangular lattice ( fig .",
    "[ lattice]b ) question , however , such an explanation .",
    "indeed , calculations of the magnetization ( fig .  [ magnettriang ] ) and susceptibility ( fig .",
    "[ susc ] ) strongly suggest that the model undergoes a typical ising - like phase transition with power - law singularities @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "what is more , the estimated exponents @xmath28 and @xmath29 remain in a good agreement with the values for the two - dimensional ising model , namely @xmath30  @xcite and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "we estimated the location of the critical point ( @xmath32 ) and values of critical exponents using the non - linear least - square method known as marquardt - levenberg algorithm @xcite , that is implemented in some popular data - processing software like e.g. , gnuplot .",

    "the estimated critical exponent @xmath28 ( inset ) seems to be close to the equilibrium ising model value @xmath30  @xcite .",

    "estimated exponents @xmath29 ( triangular ) and @xmath36 ( simple cubic ) seem to be consistent with the equilibrium ising model values @xmath37  @xcite and @xmath38  @xcite . ]      we also performed simulations for the directed three - dimensional simple cubic lattice ( fig .",

    "the estimated values of critical exponents @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ magnetd3 ] ) and @xmath36 ( fig .",

    "our extensive simulations clearly indicate that for triangular and simple cubic lattices the model has a finite - temperature phase transition .",
    "our results can be confronted with the godrche and bray analyses of the ising model ( with the heat - bath dynamics ) on directed cayley tree  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that a finite - temperature transition occurs only for the branching number @xmath42 .",
    "taking the number of out - links as the analogue of the branching number , we obtain that both triangle and simple cubic lattices have @xmath43 and thus cayley - tree analysys support our numerical results .",
    "let us also notice that for @xmath43 godrche and bray obtain @xmath44 , which is not much different from our simple - cubic result @xmath45 .",
    "we also analysed the behaviour of the ising model with the heat - bath dynamics on directed random graphs .",
    "such graphs are constructed using the following rule : for each directed pair @xmath46 , with probability @xmath47 a link from @xmath2 to @xmath48 is created ( and with probability @xmath49 the sites remain unconnected ) . the ising model with heat - bath dynamics",
    "was already examined on such graphs  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that for @xmath50 the model is disordered at any positive temperature but for @xmath51 and 3 simulations suggest a positive @xmath52 .",
    "let us notice that @xmath50 corresponds to the percolation threshold on such graphs  @xcite .",
    "before we briefly sketch the derivation of this well - known result , let us recall that percolation on directed networks is more subtle than on undirected ones . in particular , the notion of a cluster to which a given site belongs must be modified so as to take into account directedness of links .",
    "thus , one introduces the notion of an in - component defined as a set of sites from which a given site can be reached , and of an out - component being a set of sites reachable from this site .",
    "of interest is also a strongly connected component , where from each site one can reach any other site of this component . to examine the percolative properties of these components",
    ", one might use the generating function @xmath53  @xcite defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the probability that a given site has @xmath8 in - links and @xmath56 out - links . for our random graphs in the limit @xmath57",
    "we have @xmath58 using eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) , one can easily calculate the generating function ( [ gen - funct ] ) and obtain @xmath59 knowing the generating function @xmath53 , one then calculates the generating function of the in - link distribution of the site which can be reached moving against the link direction @xmath60 whose derivative being equal to unity sets the condition for the divergence of the in - component @xmath61 using eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , one obtains @xmath62 and from the condition ( [ divergence ] ) we obtain that @xmath50 determines the point of divergence of the size of the in - component .",
    "analogously , one finds the generating function of the out - link distribution of the site which can be reached moving along the link direction @xmath63 and from the condition @xmath64 one finds that again @xmath50 marks the divergence of the size of the out - component . for factorizable probability distributions @xmath55 ( as , e.g. , in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) ) , the divergence of the strongly connected component is related to the divergence of in- and out - components  @xcite . in our case",
    "it means that @xmath50 marks also the divergence of the strongly connected component .",
    "one can thus ask whether for @xmath65 the percolating components can support finite - temperature ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "such situation takes place for the ising model on undirected random graphs  @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that for directed graphs this is not the case ( fig .",
    "[ magnet ] ) . indeed , while for @xmath66 and 2 we can observe a finite - temperature ordering , for @xmath67 , which is above the percolation threshold ( @xmath50 ) , the model is not ordered at any positive temperature .",
    "let us notice that for @xmath51 and 2.5 and at low temperatures , the magnetization remains much smaller than unity , even though the simulations start from the ferromagnetic configuration ( all spins @xmath3 ) .     as a function of temperature @xmath7 for the ising model on the directed random graph . for @xmath67 ( which is above percolation threshold @xmath50 )",
    "even at @xmath68 the ferromagnetic initial configuration quickly becomes disorderd ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the simulation and relaxation times were @xmath70 .",
    "the continuous blue line shows a numerical solution of approximation ( [ mfa ] ) . ]",
    "such behaviour inclined us to examine whether a ferromagnetic state ( with a spontaneously broken symmetry ) is actually the attractor of the zero - temperature dynamics on such graphs .",
    "thus , we ran @xmath71 simulations that started from the random initial configuration and we monitored the magnetization of the final configuration .",
    "typically , the model quickly approaches the final state and @xmath72-dependence of the zero - temperature magnetization is presented in fig .",
    "[ magnet_t0 ] .",
    "one can notice that , indeed , the ferromagnetic state is an attractor of the dynamics but only for @xmath73 .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath72 ( but still above the percolation threshold ) , the dynamics keeps the system in a paramagnetic ( @xmath69 ) state .",
    "( we monitored also the total number of ferromagnetically oriented bonds , so that even in the paramagnetic case we could decide that the system reached the stationary state . ) it is thus not surprising that we were not able to observe a finite - temperature ferromagnetism for @xmath74 , since in such a case even at zero temperature the system is paramagnetic .",
    "let us notice that such a zero - temperature coarsening is much different in undirected random graphs , where the attractor is paramagnetic for any  @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "our simulations in the case of undirected random graphs confirm such a behaviour ( fig .  [ magnet_t0 ] ) .",
    "only close to @xmath75 , we found that the approach to the steady state is much slower and perhaps power law .",
    "we expect that at this value the model might exhibit some kind of a critical behaviour , but we will not present its more detailed analysis here .     as a function of @xmath72 for the ising model on the directed and undirected random graph .",
    "the system starts at a random configuration of spins and evolves until a stationary state is reached . while for the undirected random graph",
    ", the model always ends up in the disordered state @xmath76 , for the directed graph and for @xmath73 , a broken symmetry magnetized attractor is reached .",
    "the continuous blue line shows a numerical solution of approximation ( [ mfa ] ) . ]    in the final part of this section we would like to show that the behaviour of the ising model on the directed random graph can be reproduced using a certain approximate scheme .",
    "our intention is to write an evolution equation for the probability @xmath77 that a given spin , say @xmath24 , takes the value + 1 at time  @xmath78 . according to the dynamics of the model ( [ heat - bath ] ) , the probability @xmath77 depends on the spin configurations of out - neigbours of  @xmath2 .",
    "let us notice , however , that since the graph is rare , those out - neighbours are most likely connected / correlated neither with each other nor with  @xmath2 .",
    "provided that the out - neighbours of the site  @xmath2 are described by the same probability as @xmath24 , we obtain that @xmath77 obeys the following equation @xmath79 where @xmath80^{l - k}}{1+\\exp{[-4(k - l/2)/t]}}. \\label{mf1}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ mfa ] ) the term @xmath81 is the probability that a randomly chosen site has @xmath82 out - links and @xmath83 is the probability that such a site is to be set to + 1 .",
    "the steady state of eq .",
    "( [ mfa ] ) can be easily found numerically , by equating the r.h.s . to  0 and cutting - off the infinite summation over @xmath82 at a certain @xmath84 ( we used @xmath85 but larger values give nearly the same results ) .",
    "the numerical results , shown in figs",
    ".  [ magnet][magnet_t0 ] , are in an excellent agreement with the monte carlo data .",
    "although very accurate , the approximation ( [ mfa ] ) is not exact . for some values of @xmath72 and @xmath7",
    ", we performed more extensive simulations , which show that this approximation in some cases has an error @xmath86 .",
    "we attribute such a disagreement mainly to the neglect of heterogeneity in ( [ mfa ] ) but more detailed analysis of the accuracy of this kind of approximations is rather difficult @xcite .",
    "more accurate description of our model should use a set of degree - dependent functions @xmath87 instead of a single function @xmath77 , but the resulting scheme would be numerically much more demanding .",
    "in our opinion , it is interesting to discuss the behaviour of the ising model on yet another class of directed networks , which in a way interpolates between regular networks ( section ii ) and random graphs ( section iii ) .",
    "such networks are constructed in the following way : for each site of a network , we generate @xmath88 out - links to sites randomly selected from the remaining ones ( multiple links to the same site are forbidden ) . of course",
    ", for such networks the distribution of in - links is poissonian as for random graphs . since each site has a constant number of out - links , we call such a graph out - homogeneous .",
    "the merit of the analysis on such networks is that both magnetic and percolative properties can be examined ( we believe ) exactly .",
    "the ising model on such networks was used as a simple model of a financial market , where each spin @xmath24 represents an agent , whose decision to buy ( @xmath3 ) or sell ( @xmath6 ) is influenced by the decisions of its @xmath88  neighbours  @xcite .    in the out - homogeneous case , the evolution equation for @xmath77",
    "is obtained replacing poissonian distribution in eq .",
    "( [ mfa ] ) with @xmath89 @xmath90^{z - k}}{1+\\exp{[-4(k - z/2)/t]}}. \\label{gont}\\ ] ] the steady - state predictions of this equation were already analysed and accurate monte carlo simulations strongly suggest that eq .",
    "[ gont ] ) provides an exact description of the ising model  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since , as we already argued , due to a constant number of out - links , there is no problem of heterogeneity and a description in terms of a single probability function @xmath77 should be sufficient .",
    "actually , in this case the graph locally becomes equivalent to the directed cayley tree , and the ising model with the heat - bath dynamics was already analysed on such a network by godrche and bray  @xcite .",
    "they found that there is a ferromagnetic ordering in the system but only for @xmath91 while for @xmath92 and 2 the critical temperature @xmath93 .",
    "( [ gont ] ) is equivalent to that obtained by godrche and bray , and in particular , from that equation one can easily obtain the critical temperature for @xmath94 and  4 @xcite that is in agreement with that already found by godrche and bray .",
    "one can also examine percolative properties of the out - homogeneous networks . in this case",
    "the probability distribution @xmath55 has the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the kronecker delta function . for such distribution",
    ", we obtain that the generating function ( [ gen - funct ] ) becomes @xmath97 . repeating the calculations of the previous section , we find @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "then we easily obtain that @xmath92 marks the percolation transition of in- , out- , and strongly connected components .",
    "thus , for @xmath100 the model is deeply in the percolating phase with infinite in- , out- , and strongly connected components , but this is not enough to support the ferromagnetic ordering since in this case @xmath93 .",
    "in the present paper we examined the ising model on several directed networks .",
    "the behaviour on regular networks suggests that such models have much in common with the equilibrium ising models .",
    "however , the absence of the ( finite - temperature ) ferromagnetism on a square lattice and its presence on a triangular lattice show that the dimension and coordination number play here a more subtle role than in equilibrium models and some more general understanding of this aspect would be desirable .    in a way ,",
    "our results on heterogeneous directed random graphs lead to a similar conclusion .",
    "namely , while a percolating cluster provides a sufficient support for the finite - temperature ferromagnetism in undirected ( i.e. , equilibrium ) ising models , this is not enough for directed networks .",
    "such an ordering appears but only for considerably denser networks ( with larger  @xmath72 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to examine whether the appearance of ferromagnetism in this case might be related to a certain topological change of the network such as , for example , percolation of some other ( more complex ) geometrical structures .",
    "let us notice , however , that since our model does not obey the detailed balance , some other dynamics ( metropolis , cluster algorithms ) might exhibit a different , but as we expect qualitatively similar , behaviour",
    ". of interest would be to examine also directed network versions of some other closely related models such as , for example , the voter model  @xcite .",
