    "theoretical models previously showed that the protoplanetary disks can be divided to three layers in the vertical direction from a chemical point of view @xcite .",
    "surface layer of the disk is a pdr ( photon - dominated region ) because of the interstellar uv , stellar uv , and stellar x - rays .",
    "as we go deeper into the disk , the radiation becomes weaker , and the density gets high enough to allow high abundances of organic molecules . in the midplane , on the other hand , heavy - element species are mostly depleted onto grains because of very high density and very low temperature .",
    "the three - layer model naturally explains the characteristics of the disk chemistry observed in radio wavelengths : low average abundances of gaseous organic species and relatively high abundances of radical species ( ex .",
    "cn / hcn ratio ) in comparison with the molecular clouds@xcite .",
    "molecular emission lines arise mostly from the intermediate molecular layer , because it is chemically rich and spans a density range that covers critical densities of many ( sub-)millimeter rotational transitions .",
    "@xcite observed two rotational transitions ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) of various co isotopes , from which they derived @xmath7co temperature to be 30 k and @xmath0co temperature @xmath8 k. since the @xmath0co lines trace the deeper layer of the disk than the @xmath7co lines , it was the first observational evidence that the gas temperature increases with height from the midplane at radii of @xmath9 au , which are traced by the current radio telescopes .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0co temperature challenges the theoretical model ; since the sublimation temperature of co is @xmath10 k , a layer with @xmath11 k is considered to be the freeze - out layer .",
    "recently , @xcite briefly argued that existence of such cold co can be explained by vertical mixing due to turbulence . in the vertical direction gas",
    "can migrate over @xmath12 au in the vertical direction , and thus can travel from the @xmath13 k layer to the @xmath14 k layer within @xmath15 yr , which is comparable to a freeze - out timescale in the dm tau disk . in this paper",
    ", we examine their arguments in more detail using various disk models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we derive a typical migration length of material within the freeze - out timescale of co. in  3 , a distance between the @xmath14 k and 20 k layers is measured in various disk models , and is compared with the migration length .",
    "we compare our results with the recent numerical calculation of turbulent disk chemistry in  4 .",
    "summary is contained in  5 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a vertical mixing in the disk . the net transport flux of species @xmath16 by the turbulent diffusion is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the abundance of species @xmath16 relative to the number density of hydrogen molecule @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the diffusion coefficient @xmath20 is equal to the viscosity coefficient : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the turbulent velocity , @xmath23 is the mixing length , @xmath24 is the alpha - viscosity parameter @xcite , @xmath25 is the sound velocity , and @xmath26 is the scale height of the disk . the chemical continuity equation is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the chemical production and loss terms for species @xmath16 .",
    "we now consider the steady - state abundance distribution of co near the boundary between the warm molecular layer and freeze - out layer . since co is the most abundant and stable species among the carbon - bearing species in the warm molecular layer , the main production and loss terms are desorption from and adsorption onto grains , respectively .",
    "as the matter is transported from the warm molecular layer to the freeze - out layer , the desorption term becomes negligible .",
    "hence the vertical distribution of co is determined by the diffusion from the warm molecular layer and the adsorption onto grains , i.e. @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the grain radius , @xmath32 is the sticking probability , @xmath33 is the boltzman constant , @xmath34(co ) is the mass of co molecule , and @xmath35 is the grain number density . in order to derive an analytic solution",
    ", we neglect the density gradient ( @xmath36 ) , which is justified because the abundance gradient is steeper than the density gradient .",
    "then the basic equation is reduced to @xmath37    the analytic solution for this equation is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the canonical co abundance ( @xmath40 ) in the warm molecular layer and @xmath41 is the height of @xmath13 k layer , i.e. the boundary between the warm molecular layer and freeze - out layer . the decay length @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 in other words , material can migrate from the boundary @xmath44 to @xmath45 within the freeze - out timescale of co.",
    "in this section , we evaluate @xmath42 in various disk models . considering the vertical temperature gradient , we discuss if the turbulence can transport observable amount of co to the @xmath46 k layer .",
    "the decay length @xmath42 is determined by the ratio between the rate coefficient of adsorption and diffusion coefficient .",
    "the former depends on temperature , sticking probability , and total grain surface area .",
    "temperature is set to be 17 k , since we are interested only in a region between 13 k and 20 k , and since the dependence of @xmath42 on temperature is not strong .",
    "sticking probability @xmath32 is set to be 0.5 . as for dust grains ,",
    "we assume dust / gas mass ratio of 1% and grain radius of @xmath47 cm .",
    "the number density of grain @xmath35 is then @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "if the grain size distribution follows the mrn model @xcite , the total surface area ( @xmath50 ) of dust grains should be about three times larger than assumed in our model .",
    "however , observations suggest that the dust grains in disks are larger than the interstellar dust@xcite .",
    "dependence of our results on grain size in disks will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the diffusion coefficient depends on @xmath24 and scale height .",
    "we assume @xmath51 . analyzing the co emission lines in dm tau disk",
    ", @xcite found the intrinsic local velocity dispersion is essentially thermal , with a turbulent component of 0.05 km s@xmath52 @xmath53 km s@xmath52 , while @xcite estimate @xmath54 km s@xmath52 .",
    "thus by setting @xmath51 , we assume the mixing length @xmath23 of several @xmath55 . the scale height of the disk is given by @xmath56 where @xmath6 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath57 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath58 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath59 is the mass of the central star .",
    "we assume @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath42 is given as a function of hydrogen number density @xmath49 and disk radius @xmath62 : @xmath63    here we evaluate @xmath42 in two disk models from literature : dm tau disk model , which is constructed to fit the sed assuming the grain size of 0.1 @xmath6 m @xcite , and a model by @xcite , who assumed interstellar - type dust is well mixed with gas .",
    "models give @xmath49 and @xmath64 as a function of @xmath62 and @xmath65 . at each radius",
    "we calculate @xmath42 using @xmath49 in the layer of @xmath66 k. in figure 1 , asterisks , open boxes , and crosses depict @xmath42 with the density @xmath49 at @xmath13 k layer , @xmath14 k layer , and with the average density of @xmath66 k layer at each radius , respectively . the black marks are the dm tau disk model and the gray marks are the @xcite model .",
    "for example , @xmath49 is @xmath67 @xmath68 at the boundary between the molecular layer and the freeze - out layer at @xmath69 au in both models .",
    "then the decay length @xmath42 is @xmath12 au . also shown in figure 1 ( closed circles ) is the distance between the layers of @xmath13 k and 13 k , @xmath70 , at each radius in the two disk models .",
    "it can be seen that at radius of @xmath71 au , @xmath70 is about 4 times larger than @xmath42 . in other words ,",
    "when the disk material transported vertically from the 20 k layer to the 13 k layer , gaseous co is @xmath72 times the canonical value .",
    "it should be noted that the column density of co gas with @xmath46 k is given by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the number density of co molecule at the 20 k layer ( @xmath44 ) . at the radius of 400 au , for example , @xmath42 is about 10 au , and @xmath75(co ) is @xmath4 @xmath68",
    ". then the column density of @xmath7co with @xmath46 k is @xmath76 @xmath77 , which corresponds to the opacity of @xmath78 for the @xmath79 emission line of @xmath0co , assuming the isotope abundance ratio of @xmath80co)/@xmath81co)@xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the amount of cold @xmath0co produced by the turbulent mixing is high enough to account for the observation by @xcite .",
    "finally , it is obvious from the equation ( 6 ) that in the disks with larger ( smaller ) @xmath24 , @xmath42 is larger ( smaller ) , and thus the cold co is more ( less)abundant .",
    "so far , we have assumed that dust grains in disks are similar to the interstellar grains .",
    "however , observations suggest grains in disks are larger than the interstellar grains . dust lane width of edge - on disks is smaller than that of model disks with interstellar grains .",
    "the sed is better reproduced by the disk models with the maximum grain radius in millimeter range @xcite . in this subsection , we compare the decay length @xmath42 and the vertical temperature gradient in the disk models of @xcite .",
    "they investigated the effect of grain growth on disk structure ( @xmath49 and @xmath64 ) ; the number density of grains with radius @xmath31 is assumed to be proportional to @xmath83 , and the maximum size @xmath84 is varied with the dust / gas mass ratio fixed .",
    "figure 2 compares @xmath42 and @xmath85 in the models with ( a ) @xmath86 m and ( b ) 1 mm .",
    "compared with the case of uniform grain size ( @xmath87 m ) , the total surface area of grains is smaller by a factor of ( a ) 0.3 and ( b ) 0.03 . because of the smaller total surface area of grains , the adsorption time scale and thus @xmath42 are larger in the model with @xmath88 mm ( see eq .",
    "6 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath85 is smaller in @xmath89 mm model than in @xmath86 m model at @xmath90 au .",
    "temperature in the disk atmosphere is lower , and hence the vertical width of the disk is smaller in the model with larger @xmath84 , because of the reduced number of small grains which mainly contribute to the absorption of stellar light . at @xmath91 au ,",
    "the temperature in the midplane layer increases with grain growth , and @xmath70 is slightly larger in the @xmath88 mm model .",
    "we can conclude that at @xmath92 au the amount of cold co gas increases as the @xmath84 increases from @xmath93 m to 1 mm .",
    "recently @xcite investigated the molecular evolution in a turbulent disk by coupling the chemical reaction network and turbulent diffusion .",
    "they showed that the two - dimensional diffusion increases the amount of cold co , but the amount is too small to account for the observation by @xcite .",
    "why is the cold co much less abundant in their model than estimated in the present work ?",
    "we suspect that the deficiency of cold co is caused by the too efficient grain - surface reactions . even in the @xmath94",
    "k region in their static model , co abundance is much smaller than the canonical value .",
    "inclusion of the vertical diffusion _ reduces _ the cold co , because more co is converted to h@xmath95co by grain - surface reactions ( see their ",
    "since the sublimation temperature of h@xmath95co is higher than that of co , the hydrogenation depletes co at @xmath94 k. the rate of hydrogenation , however , seems to be overestimated in their model , as discussed below .    in the layer of @xmath94",
    "k at @xmath92 au , we estimate the number density of h atoms ( not included in h@xmath95 ) in the gas phase to be @xmath96 @xmath68 , referring to the model of @xcite with @xmath97 m . the number of h atoms accreting onto a grain with radius @xmath31 is @xmath98 the desorption rate , on the other hand , is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the number density of adsorption sites on a grain ( @xmath101 @xmath77 ) , and @xmath102 is the adsorption energy @xcite . if @xmath102 is 350 k @xcite , the desorption rate is @xmath103 s@xmath52 at 20 k. hence a number of h atoms on a dust grain is much smaller than unity even for grains with @xmath104 m .",
    "with such a low h atom abundance on a grain , the hydrogenation rate is limited by the accretion rate rather than determined by a migration rate on a grain @xcite . according to the model description of @xcite , they seems to have estimated the hydrogenation rate using the migration rate , which can be an overestimate .",
    "reality can be more complex than the above argument .",
    "for example , grains are not spherical but would be porous , which will enhance the possibility of reaction before desorption @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , laboratory experiment suggests that co is hydrogenated only in the surface layer of the ice mantle @xcite .",
    "most of the currently - available astrochemistry models may overestimate the hydrogenation rates , since they do not discriminate the surface species from species inside ice mantle .",
    "modeling the grain - surface reactions is still a challenging subject in the astrochemical studies .",
    "however , it is an observational fact that cold ( @xmath5 k ) co gas exists in the disk .",
    "if the co depletion is caused by hydrogenation in the model by @xcite , it tells us even the abundance of simple gaseous species can be dependent on how we model the grain - surface reactions  an important caution for future models .",
    "we have shown that in protoplanetary disks the turbulent diffusion can produce observable amount of co that is colder than the sublimation temperature . as disk material",
    "is transported to the layer with @xmath46 k , freeze out proceeds with timescale of @xmath105 .",
    "since the gas migrates over a distance of @xmath12 au within this timescale , co gas of column density @xmath76 @xmath77 exists in the cold ( @xmath46 k ) layers , which explains the observation by @xcite . as the dust grains in the disk",
    "become larger by coagulation , the freeze - out time scale increases , and the vertical temperature gradient at @xmath94 k gets steeper .",
    "hence , the apparent co temperature decreases as the maximum grain size increases from @xmath6m - size to mm - size .",
