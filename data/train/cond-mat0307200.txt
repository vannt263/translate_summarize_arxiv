    "the feat of reproducing certain features of the physics of relativistic quantum fields on curved space - time backgrounds @xcite , in the laboratory , now seems closer than ever before . due to the realization of the fact that phonons or generally `` relativistic '' quasiparticles , propagating in a nonrelativistic background fluid , experience an effective curved space - time @xcite , various exotic phenomena of the physics of classical as well as quantum fields in the curved space - times of gravity are getting within the reach of laboratory scale experiments @xcite .",
    "the particle content of a quantum field state in curved or flat space - time depends on the motional state of the observer .",
    "a manifestation of this observer dependence is the unruh - davies effect , which consists in the fact that a constantly accelerated detector in the minkowski vacuum responds as if it were placed in a thermal bath with temperature proportional to its acceleration @xcite .",

    "@xcite .    in the following",
    ", we shall argue that the observer dependence of the particle content of a quantum field state in curved space - time , related to the familiar non - uniqueness of canonical field quantization in riemannian spaces @xcite , can be experimentally demonstrated in the readily available ultralow temperature condensed matter system bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "more specifically , we argue that the gibbons - hawking effect @xcite , a curved space - time generalization of the unruh - davies effect , can be observed in an expanding bec . to explicitly show that particle detection depends on the detector setting , we construct a condensed matter detector tuned to time intervals in effective laboratory and de sitter space - times , respectively @xcite .",
    "we show that the detector response is strongly different in the two cases , and associated to the corresponding effective space - time .",
    "furthermore , we describe a system of space - time coordinates in which there is no particle detection whatsoever taking place , which we will call the `` adiabatic '' basis , and which simply corresponds to a detector at rest in the ( conformal ) minkowski vacuum .",
    "it recently became apparent that among the most suitable systems for the simulation of quantum phenomena in effective space - times are bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "they offer the primary advantages of dissipation - free superflow , high controllability , with atomic precision , of the physical parameters involved , and the accessibility of ultralow temperatures @xcite .",
    "even more importantly , in the context under consideration here , the theory of phononic quasiparticles in the inhomogeneous bec is kinematically identical to that of a massless scalar field propagating on the background of curved space - time in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "it was shown by unruh that the action of the phase fluctuations @xmath5 in a moving inhomogeneous superfluid may be written in the form @xcite ( we set @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of a superfluid constituent particle ) : @xmath8 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\equiv & \\frac12 \\int d^{d+1}x % dt dz   \\sqrt{-{\\sf g } } { \\sf g}^{\\mu\\nu }   \\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial_\\nu \\phi \\ , .",

    "furthermore , the velocity potential of the sound perturbations in the bec satisfies the canonical commutation relations of a relativistic scalar field @xcite .",
    "we therefore have the exact mapping , on the level of kinematics , of the equation of motion for phononic quasiparticles in a nonrelativistic superfluid , to quantized massless scalar fields propagating on a curved space - time background with local lorentz invariance .",

    "we identify the action ( [ 1daction ] ) with the action of a minimally coupled scalar field in 1 + 1d , according to eq.([action ] ) .",
    "remarkably , such an identification is possible only close to the center @xmath66 . the contravariant 1 + 1d metric",

    "inverting this expression to get the covariant metric , we obtain @xmath70 the term @xmath71 contained in the action ( [ action ] ) gives the familiar conformal invariance in a 1 + 1d space - time , i.e. , the conformal factor @xmath68 drops out from the action and thus does not influence the classical equations of motion .",
    "we therefore leave out @xmath68 in the formulae to follow , but it needs to be borne in mind that the metric elements are defined always up to the factor @xmath68 .    the actions ( [ action ] ) and ( [ 1daction ] ) can be made consistent if we renormalize the phase field according to @xmath72 _ and _ require that @xmath73 holds .",

    "more explicitly , eq.([zc0 ] ) leads to @xmath75 according to the above relation , we have to impose that the expansion of the cigar in the perpendicular direction proceeds like the square root of the expansion in the axial direction .",
    "the constant quantity @xmath76 can be fixed externally ( by the experimentalist ) , choosing the expansion of the cloud appropriately by adjusting the time dependence of the trapping frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath77 , according to the scaling equations @xcite @xmath78 since both @xmath79 and @xmath80 depend on @xmath41 , an effective space - time metric for the axial phonons can be obtained only close to the center of the cigar - shaped condensate cloud .",
    "this is related to our averaging over the physical perpendicular direction , and does not arise if the excitations are considered in the full d - dimensional situation , where this identification is possible globally . also note that the action ( [ 1daction ] ) does not contain a curvature scalar contribution of the form @xmath81 $ ] , i.e. , that it only possesses trivial conformal invariance @xcite .",
    "we now impose , in addition , the requirement that the metric is identical to that of a 1 + 1d universe , with a metric of the form of the de sitter metric in 3 + 1d @xcite .",

    "the latter condition then justifies neglecting the @xmath41 dependence in @xmath79 and @xmath80 in eq.([zc0 ] ) .",

    "there is a detector setting which corresponds to a detector at rest in the minkowski vacuum .",

    "the major observation of the present investigation is , that the physical nature of the effective space - time considered in the condensed matter system reflects itself directly in the quasiparticle ( phonon ) content measured by a detector which has a natural time interval equal to the time interval of this particular effective space - time .",
    "we have demonstrated that the notion of observer dependence can be made experimentally manifest by an _",

    "tunable _ effective time interval .",
    "there is thus opened up a possibility to confirm experimentally , in an effective curved space - time setting , that , indeed , `` a particle detector will react to states which have positive frequency with respect to the detector s proper time , not with respect to any universal time @xcite .

    "the gibbons - hawking effect in the bec is intrinsically quantum : the signal contains a `` dimensionless planck constant , '' i.e. the gaseous ( loop expansion ) parameter @xmath214 .",
    "this implies that a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio can be achieved only by using initially dense clouds with strong interparticle interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "the phononic quasiparticles of the superfluid can be regarded as non - interacting only in a first approximation in @xmath215 .",
    "the effects of self - interaction between the phonons , induced by larger values of the gaseous parameter , can lead to decoherence and the relaxation of the phonon subsystem .",
    "the same line of reasoning applies to the evolution of quantum fields in the expanding universe .",
