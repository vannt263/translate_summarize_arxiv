    "* ) . for lenses composed of two masses , on the other hand ,",
    "the orbital motion of the binary lens induces the rotation of the binary axis .",
    "this also causes modulations of the relative lens - source position and deviations from the light curve of a static binary - lens event ( lens orbital effect : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "detecting deviations in lensing light curves caused by the orbital motions of the observer and the lens are important because they can provide us with a useful information that can be used to characterize lens systems .",
    "analysis of lensing light curves affected by the microlens parallax effect enables one to measure the microlens parallax vector @xmath0 , of which magnitude is related to the physical parameters of the lens mass @xmath1 and the distance to the lens @xmath2 by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the angular einstein radius , @xmath5 , au is the astronomical unit , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the distance to the source @xcite .",
    "analyses of the light curves affected by the lens - orbital effect enables one to constrain the orbital parameters of a binary lens system @xcite .",
    "rooted on the same origin of the orbital motion , however , both the parallactic motion of the earth and the rotation of the binary lens may have similar effects on the relative lens - source motion , resulting in similar deviations in lensing light curves @xcite .",
    "if so , characterizing binary lenses by detecting the microlens - parallax and lens - orbital effects can be seriously hampered due to the difficulty in distinguishing one effect from the other .",
    "in addition to the single frame of the accelerating earth , microlens parallaxes can also be measured from the simultaneous observation of a lensing event using ground - based telescopes and a space - based satellite in a solar orbit . in this case , the projected earth - satellite separation @xmath8 is comparable to the einstein radius of typical galactic microlensing events , i.e.  @xmath9 au , and thus the relative lens - source positions seen from ground and in space appear to be different , resulting in different light curves .",
    "combined analysis of the light curves obtained from the ground - based and space - based observations leads to the measurement of the microlens parallax @xcite , which is referred to as the `` space - based microlens parallax '' . in order to distinguish from the space - based microlens parallax , the microlens parallax measured based on the annular parallactic motion of the earth is referred to as `` annual microlens parallax '' .",
    "the space - based microlens parallax measurement was recently realized by the microlensing program using the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite . the goal of the program is to determine the galactic distribution of planets by measuring microlens parallaxes and thereby estimate the distances of the individual lenses @xcite . from the observations conducted in 2014 and 2015 seasons ,",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "microlensing program yielded important scientific results including measurements of the physical parameters of two planetary systems @xcite , microlens parallax measurements of 22 single - mass objects @xcite , characterizations of binary objects including the discovery of a binary with a massive remnant component @xcite .",
    "followed by the successful first two seasons , space - based microlensing observations using the _ spitzer _ mission will be carried on in 2016 season .",
    "in addition to the _ spitzer _ microlensing program , _ k2 _",
    "s campaign 9 is scheduled to conduct a microlensing survey in 2016 season . since _",
    "k2 _ has an earth - trailing heliocentric orbit with a semi - major axis @xmath10 au , it will be also an important instrument for space - based microlens parallax observation . from the _ k2 _",
    "survey , it is expected to measure microlens parallax for @xmath11 lensing events @xcite .",
    "space - based microlens parallax observations can be useful in resolving the possible degeneracy between the microlens - parallax and lens - orbital effects in the analyses of lensing light curves .",
    "the positional change of an observer during a lensing event caused by the annual parallactic motion of the earth is usually small and thus deviations in lensing light curves are subtle .",
    "in contrast , the difference between the light curves seen from ground and in space is very prominent because the earth - satellite separation is a significant portion of the einstein radius .",
    "since the difference is almost entirely attributed to the parallax effect , then , the microlens parallax can be uniquely determined from the combined analysis of the two light curves .",
    "once the microlens parallax is measured , one can constrain the orbital lens parameters by further analyzing the residual from the model with parallax parameters .    in this paper , we demonstrate the severity of the degeneracy between the microlens - parallax and lens - orbital effects by presenting the analysis of an actually observed binary - lens event .",
    "we also show that the degeneracy can be readily resolved with the additional data from space - based parallax observations .",
    "in order to describe a binary lensing light curves , one needs many parameters .",
    "a microlensing modeling is a process of finding a set of lensing parameters that results in the best - fit model light curve to the observed one . for the simplest case of a binary - lens event with a linear observer s motion and a static binary",
    ", one needs 7 parameters and the number of parameters increases in order to consider higher - order effects like the microlens - parallax and lens - orbital effects .",
    "furthermore , lensing parameters are usually tightly correlated one another @xcite and thus the parameters describing the microlens - parallax and lens - orbital effects are likely to be related not only to each other but also to other parameters . as a result",
    ", it is difficult to analytically track down the complex multi - dimensional correlations between parameters .",
    "we , therefore , show the severity of the degeneracy between the two higher - order effects for an example event where higher - order effects are needed to describe the observed light curve .",
    "ogle-2015-blg-0768 is an exemplary lensing event where we find that the degeneracy between the microlens - parallax and lens - orbital effects is severe .",
    "the event occurred on a source star that is located toward the galactic bulge field .",
    "the coordinates of the source are @xmath12 , that correspond to the galactic coordinates @xmath13 .",
    "the lensing - induced brightening of the source star was discovered on 2015 april 22 by the early warning system ( ews ) of the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) group that has conducted microlensing survey since 1992 using the 1.3 m telescope located at the las campanas observatory in chile @xcite .",
    "the event was also observed by the korean microlensing telescope network ( kmtnet : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey that was commenced in 2015 .",
    "the kmtnet survey is composed of three identical 1.6 m telescopes that are located at cerro tololo interamerican observatory in chile ( kmt ctio ) , south african astronomical observatory in south africa ( kmt saao ) , and siding spring observatory in australia ( kmt sso ) .",
    "the kmt ctio and saao started their operation in february , 2015 , but the kmt sso was not yet operational at the time of the event .",
    "the kmtnet survey conducted with a @xmath14 minute cadence for its main field .",
    "the source star of the event was in the field that was observed with a @xmath15  1 day cadence mainly in support of the _ spitzer _ microlensing program .    in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the light curve of ogle-2015-blg-0768 .",
    "it shows a complicated sequence of three peaks that occurred chronologically at @xmath16 , 7144 , and 7158 .",
    "the second peak is composed of two spikes where the region between them shows a `` u''-shape trough .",
    "such an anomaly is a characteristic feature that appears when a source crosses caustics , which represent the locations on the source plane at which a point - source magnification becomes infinity , formed by a binary lens , indicating that the event was occurred by a binary lens .",
    "the first and third peaks do not show such a caustic - crossing feature , suggesting that they were produced by either passing over or approaching tips of the caustic .    considering the characteristic features of the light curve , we conduct binary - lens modeling of the light curve .",
    "we begin with a simplest case where the relative lens - source motion is linear . among the 7 principal binary - lensing parameters for this standard modeling",
    ", 3 parameters describe the source - lens approach , including the time of the closest approach of the source to a reference position of the lens , @xmath17 , the source - reference separation at that time , @xmath18 , and the angle between the source trajectory and the binary axis , @xmath19 ( source trajectory angle ) . for the reference position in the lens plane ,",
    "we use the center of mass of the binary lens .",
    "another parameter @xmath20 ( einstein time scale ) , which is defined as the time for the source to cross the angular einstein radius @xmath4 of the lens , represents the time scale of the event .",
    "the einstein ring is the image of the source for the case of the exact lens - source alignment and it is used as a length scale in describing lensing phenomenon .",
    "two other parameters characterize the binary lens including @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which represent the projected separation and mass ratio , respectively .",
    "we note that the two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are normalized to @xmath4 .",
    "the last parameter @xmath23 is the ratio of the angular source radius @xmath24 to the angular einstein radius , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "this normalized source radius is needed to describe the caustic - crossing parts of the light curve that are affected by the finite size of the source star .",
