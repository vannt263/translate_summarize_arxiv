    "very recently , there have been proposals for constructing generalizations of teleparallel gravity in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite which followed the spirit of @xmath1 gravity ( see @xcite for a review ) as a generalization of general relativity .",
    "that is , the lagrangians of the theories were generalized to the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is some suitably differentiable function and @xmath4 is the lagrangian of teleparallel gravity @xcite .",
    "the interest in these theories was aroused by the claim that their dynamics differ from those of general relativity but their equations are still second order in derivatives and , therefore , they might be able to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe and remain free of pathologies .",
    "it has been shown , however , that this last expectation was unfounded : these theories are not locally lorentz invariant and appear to harbour extra degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "even if one decides to give up teleparallelism , such actions would not make sense as descriptions of the dynamics of gravity if local lorentz symmetry was restored @xcite .",
    "based on the definition given in these theories , the weitzenbock connection , the torsion tensor and the contortion tensor are not local lorentz  scalars ( i.e. they do not remain invariant under a local lorentz transformation in tangent space ) .",
    "this is the root of the lack of lorentz invariance in generalized teleparallel theories of gravity .",
    "the @xmath2 models behave very differently from the @xmath5cdm model on large scales , and are , therefore , very unlikely to be suitable alternatives to it @xcite .",
    "since this theory is not invariant under local lorentz transformations , the choice of tetrad plays a crucial role in such models .",
    "different tetrads will lead to different field equations which in turn have different solutions @xcite .",
    "it is known that the lagrangian @xmath4 of teleparallel gravity only differs from the riemann curvature scalar @xmath6 by a boundary term@xcite .",
    "recall that in general relativity the einstein field equation can be derived from a _ reduced _ lagrangian @xmath7 which only differs from the riemann curvature scalar @xmath6 of the christoffel symbol @xmath8 by a boundary term @xmath9 with @xmath10 @xcite . following the spirit of @xmath1 gravity we can propose a modified theory of gravity called * reduced * @xmath1 *  gravity * or @xmath11 *  gravity * given by a lagrangian which is a function of  @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "it will be seen in this letter that this theory is identified as a metrical formulation of @xmath14 gravity .",
    "in contrast with @xmath14 gravity , the new theory , @xmath15 gravity respects local lorentz symmetry and harbour no extra degrees of freedom , since the dynamical variable is the metric instead of the tetrad . at the same time it has the advantage over @xmath1 gravity that its field equations are",
    "second - order instead of fourth - order and then is free of pathologies .",
    "the disadvantage of @xmath15 gravity is that its field equations do not respect general covariance .",
    "the significant pay - off that will be suggested in this letter is that @xmath16 gravity may provide an satisfactory alternative to conventional dark energy in general relativistic cosmology and a new explanation of the acceleration of the cosmic expansion .",
    "the changing of the expansion from decelerating to accelerating is an intrinsic property of the universe without need of an exotic dark energy . the cosmological constant problem , the coincidence problem and the problem of phantom divide line crossing are naturally solved .",
    "we start from the reduced action @xmath18 where @xmath19 with the bare gravitational constant @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the reduced gravitational lagrangian of general relativity @xcite with the christoffel symbol @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath12 is a quadratic form of the gravitational _ strength _ @xmath23 and identified with the kinetic energy of the gravitational potential @xmath24 .",
    "the variational principle yields the field equations for the metric @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 @xmath27 is the ricci curvature tensor of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the energy - momentum of the matter fields .",
    "these equations can be re - arranged in the einstein - like form @xmath30",
    "we now investigate the cosmological dynamics for the models based on @xmath16 gravity . in order to derive conditions for the cosmological viability of @xmath16 models we shall carry out a general analysis without specifying the form of @xmath16 at first .",
    "we consider a flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background with the metric @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a scale factor .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the christoffel symbol are      and @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the hubble parameter and a dot represents a derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath37 .",
    "one can find that @xmath12 is identified with the gravitational lagrangian of the cosmological model of @xmath2 gravity given by bengochea and ferraro @xcite .",
    "the the field equations ( 6 ) take the forms @xmath38 @xmath39 which lead to @xmath40 it is easy to see that , in @xmath16 gravity , the gravitational constant @xmath41 is replaced by an effective ( time dependent ) @xmath42 . on the other hand , it is reasonable to assume that the present day value of @xmath43 is the same as the @xmath41 so that we get the simple constraint :        if @xmath15 has the form @xmath46 then the equations ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) become @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the density and the pressure of the  dark energy ",
    "@xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the state equation of the  dark energy ",
    "is then @xmath53    let @xmath54 .",
    "for any function @xmath55 we have @xmath56 the the equation ( 20 ) becomes @xmath57 the equations ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) become @xmath58 @xmath59 we see that a constant @xmath60 acts just like a cosmological constant ( dark energy ) , and @xmath60 linear in @xmath12 ( i.e. @xmath61constant ) is simply a redefinition of gravitational constant @xmath41 .",
    "the the equation ( 23 ) can be written as @xmath62 taking a universe with only dust matter so @xmath63 we have @xmath64 and then we find the solution @xmath65 in closed form : @xmath66        in the vacuum ( 30 ) gives a * universal * de  sitter solution @xmath71 for _ any function _ @xmath72 .",
    "then ( 20 ) gives @xmath73 which means that the function @xmath72 plays the role of the cosmological constant or dark energy .",
    "when @xmath81 i.e. for the gravitational lagrangian @xmath82 ( 39 ) gives @xmath83 letting @xmath84 and @xmath85 one can compute @xmath86 then when @xmath87 we obtain @xmath88 observations of type ia supernovae at moderately large redshifts ( @xmath89 to @xmath90 ) have led to the conclusion that the hubble expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite .",
    "this is consistent also with microwave background measurements @xcite .",
    "according to the result of @xcite , @xmath91 corresponds to @xmath92 which is consistent with the observations .",
    "the equation ( 38 ) now becomes @xmath93 using the formula @xmath94 ( 45 ) can be rewritten as @xmath95 and integrated @xmath96 this function is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , which is roughly consistent with the observations @xcite .      _",
    "_ the equation ( 15 ) indicates that during the evolution of the universe @xmath97 decreases owing to decreasing of the matter density @xmath98 .",
    "this makes @xmath99 descend during the evolution of the universe .",
    "the evolution of the function @xmath100 given by ( 41 ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . according to ( 41 ) when @xmath101 , @xmath102 @xmath103 , @xmath52 changes from  visible  to dark as indicated by ( 17 ) .",
    "if @xmath104 , it decelerates the expansion , if @xmath105 , it accelerates the expansion .",
    "when @xmath106 , @xmath99 crosses the phantom divide line @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , the expansion of the universe naturally includes a decelerating and an accelerating phase .",
    "@xmath108 given by ( 42 ) can be seen as a new constant describing the evolution of the universe .",
