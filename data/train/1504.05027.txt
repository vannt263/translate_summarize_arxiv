    "the dynamics of opinion sharing and competing has become an active topic of recent research in statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "one of the most successful methodologies used in opinion dynamics is agent - based modeling  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to construct the computational devices ( known as agents with some properties ) and then simulate them in parallel to model the real phenomena . in physics",
    "this technique can be traced back to monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite . beyond relevance as physics models ,",
    "the ferromagnetic ising model  @xcite , the xy model  @xcite and the potts model  @xcite can be seen as agent - based models for opinion dynamics .",
    "other versions of opinion models have also been proposed , such as the sznajd model  @xcite , the majority rule model  @xcite , the voter model  @xcite , and the social impact model  @xcite .",
    "some models display a disorder - order transition  @xcite , from a regime in which opinions are arbitrarily diverse to one in which most individuals hold the same opinion .",
    "other models focus the emergence of a global consensus , in which all agents finally share the same opinion  @xcite .",
    "it has been known that the formation of opinion clusters plays an important role in opinion dynamics  @xcite .",
    "an opinion cluster is defined as a connected component ( subgraph ) fully occupied by nodes holding the same opinion .",
    "recently , shao @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "proposed a nonconsensus opinion ( nco ) model  @xcite in which each node adopts the majority opinion in its neighborhood at each time step .",
    "it was found that a large spanning cluster of nodes holding the same opinion appears when the initial fraction of nodes holding this opinion exceeds a certain threshold  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the nco model , li @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "proposed an inflexible contrarian opinion ( ico ) model in which some agents never change their original opinion but may influence the opinions of others  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the threshold above which a large spanning cluster appears is increased with the fraction of inflexible contrarians .    in both the nco and ico models ,",
    "an agent will adopt the opinion that is held by more than half of neighbors .",
    "however , in many real - life situations , a quorum far larger than one half is necessary to pass a resolution .",
    "for example , a referendum to recall the president of the united states requires the support of two - thirds of the senators .",
    "based on the above reasons , in this paper we generalize the nco model by assuming that an agent will change its opinion when the fraction of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood exceeds a threshold @xmath4 .",
    "we call this generalized model as the ncot model . when the threshold @xmath5 , the ncot model recovers to the nco model .",
    "when @xmath6 , the ncot model becomes the standard percolation without opinion dynamics .",
    "both the nco and ico models focus on the critical value for finite - size networks . by the standard finite - size scaling approach ,",
    "we have obtained a critical point at which the phase transition takes place in the limit of infinite network size .",
    "it is interesting to find that , continuous or discontinuous phase transitions can arise in the ncot model , depending on the value of @xmath2 and the network structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we introduce the ncot model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : main results ] , we study the ncot model on square lattices , random networks and scale - free networks , respectively . finally , conclusions and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in the ncot model on networks , each node holds one of the binary opinions denoted by + 1 and @xmath7 .",
    "initially , a fraction @xmath8 of nodes with the opinion + 1 and @xmath9 with the opinion @xmath7 are selected at random .",
    "the neighborhood of node @xmath10 is composed of node @xmath10 and its nearest neighbors . at each time step",
    ", each node will convert to its opposite opinion , if the fraction of nodes holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood exceeds a threshold @xmath2 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the system is considered to reach a stable state if no more changes occur .",
    "we focus on the formation of opinion clusters in the ncot model .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the size of the largest + 1 cluster and @xmath13 the size of the second largest + 1 cluster in the steady state .",
    "then we define @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the network size . in the following ,",
    "we carry out simulations systematically by employing the ncot model on square lattices , random networks and scale - free networks respectively .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the ncot model on an @xmath17 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our extensive numerical simulations reveal that the phase transition of the ncot model on square lattice can be roughly divided into three regimes ( different universality classes of percolation ) by tuning the parameter @xmath2 , namely , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 $ ] . in the same regime ,",
    "the results are insensitive to the values of @xmath2 .",
    "particularly , it is noted that for @xmath21 , the corresponding phase transition pertains to the class of invasion percolation with trapping  @xcite ; while for @xmath22 , it gives rise to a phase transition subjecting to regular site percolation .",
    "the percolation threshold is @xmath23 for @xmath18  @xcite and @xmath24 for @xmath25 $ ]  @xcite , respectively . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the phase transition has some interesting features and has not been reported before , which will be a focus for this section . to be specific , in the following simulation",

    ", @xmath28 displays a sharp peak , a characteristic of a second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the normalized size of the second largest cluster @xmath28 as a function of @xmath8 for different values of @xmath16 . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we observe that the location of @xmath34 changes with @xmath16 .",
    "the percolation threshold @xmath34 of a system of finite size @xmath16 obeys the relation  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the percolation threshold for a system of infinite size and @xmath37 is the correlation critical exponent",
    ". then a simple linear fit ( based on the maximization of the pearson s correlation coefficient ) of @xmath34 vs. @xmath38 allows to simultaneously compute both values of @xmath36 and @xmath37  @xcite . at the percolation threshold @xmath36 , the normalized size of the largest cluster @xmath32 and the susceptibility @xmath39 vs. the system size @xmath16 follow a power - law form : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    from simulation results ,",
    "we obtain @xmath42 for @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows @xmath43 , @xmath32 and @xmath44 as a function of @xmath16 respectively . from figs .",
    "[ fig3](a)-(c ) , we estimate the critical exponents @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as the best fit of the data points .    for square lattice , our numerical simulations reveal that the critical point @xmath36 increases as @xmath2 becomes larger .",
    "this is because for square lattice , the critical point @xmath48 is typically larger than 0.5 .",
    "thus in this region , a larger @xmath2 hinders the transition of opinion @xmath7 to @xmath49 as it requires more @xmath49 neighbors , reducing the final fraction of @xmath49 nodes in the steady state , which in turn , will need a larger @xmath8 for the spanning cluster of opinion @xmath49 to emerge .",

    "er networks are characterized by a poisson degree distribution with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the degree of a node and @xmath53 is the average degree of the network .",
    "we perform simulations with different network sizes @xmath16 .",
    "each data point presented below is an average over 10000 , 8000 , 6000 , 4000 , 3000 , 2000 and 1000 different realizations for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "we have found that , when the average degree is small , the phase transition is continuous , while when the average degree is adequately large , depending on @xmath2 , the transition can become discontinuous .        to be specific ,",
    "we have found that when the average degree @xmath61 , the opinion percolation belongs to a continuous phase transition for the whole range of the parameter @xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for different values of @xmath2 ranging from 0.5 to 1 , the normalized size of the largest cluster @xmath32 continuously increases with @xmath8 and the normalized size of the second largest cluster @xmath28 peaks at a certain critical value of @xmath8 .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the percolation threshold @xmath36 as a function of @xmath2 when the average degree @xmath50 .",
    "the general trend is that as @xmath2 increases , the critical threshold fc decreases .",
    "this can be understood that when @xmath62 , a node switches its opinion when half of its neighbors ( including itself ) has the opposite opinion , therefore nodes tend to form clusters with the same opinions .",
    "but since @xmath2 is small , the cluster is not compact , but rather sparsely connected . in the region where the initial fraction of nodes with + 1 opinion @xmath63 , nodes with -1 are majority , the node is more likely to be surrounded by neighbors with opposite opinions . thus if @xmath2 is small , a node with + 1 is more likely to switch to -1 , therefore the effective fraction of nodes with + 1 becomes smaller , making it more difficult for a spanning cluster to emerge .",
    "as @xmath2 increases , it is harder for a node to switch its opinion ( requires more neighbors with opposite opinions ) , leading to a larger effective fraction of nodes with + 1 , and therefore a higher probability for a spanning cluster to emerge . note that the effective fraction of nodes with + 1 will still be smaller than @xmath8 since nodes with -1 are still majorities therefore more nodes with + 1 will be switched to -1 than the opposite process .",
    "a surprising phenomenon is that there exists an optimal value of @xmath2 ( about 0.7 ) leading to the minimum of @xmath36 .",
    "this could be a result of higher order interaction between the network topology and the opinion dynamics .",
    "for example , although a larger @xmath2 means more difficult for a node to switch its opinion , but once the condition is satisfied and this node switches , the cluster grows and it will be more compact , and it will be more resistive to changes caused by outside nodes , leading to a nonmonotonic behavior of @xmath36 versus @xmath2 .",
    "the nonmonotonic relation between @xmath36 and @xmath2 can also confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we can see that the critical value of @xmath8 that corresponds to the peak of @xmath28 is the smallest when @xmath27 .",
    "when the average degree @xmath53 is adequately large ( e.g. , @xmath64 ) , the opinion percolation can display a continuous or a discontinuous phase transition , depending on the value of @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the normalized size of the largest cluster @xmath32 as a function of @xmath8 for different values of @xmath2 when @xmath64 . from figs .",
    "[ fig6](a ) and ( b ) , we observe that there exist two abrupt transition points when @xmath2 is small ( e.g. , @xmath5 and @xmath65 ) . at the first abrupt transition point denoted by @xmath36",

    ", @xmath32 jumps from a finite value to one . between the two abrupt transition points",
    ", @xmath32 continuously increases with @xmath8 .",
    "however , for the large value of @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xmath67 ) , @xmath32 approaches zero continuously as @xmath8 is decreased from 1 to 0 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) ] .",
    "these numerical results indicate that the behavior of @xmath32 versus @xmath8 could be a discontinuous phase transition for the small value of @xmath2 and a continuous phase transition for the large value of @xmath2 . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , it is seen that the system has a symmetry , i.e. , the curves are unchanged if @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this is because , in this case , the nodes are densely connected , therefore one can neglect the small clusters for either @xmath49 or @xmath7 opinions . denote @xmath70 as the normalized size for the largest cluster for @xmath7 , we have @xmath71 .",
    "since the dynamics for the evolution of @xmath49 into @xmath7 and vice versa are the same , this imposes a duality between @xmath49 and @xmath7 states .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath8 after the opinion dynamics reach the steady state the normalized size of the largest cluster for @xmath49 is @xmath72 , is actually the same process for @xmath7 opinions with a given initial fraction @xmath9 and a largest cluster with normalized size @xmath73 .",

    "<S> the nco model on lattices and several complex networks displays a phase transition behavior , which is characterized by a large spanning cluster of nodes holding the same opinion appears when the initial fraction of nodes holding this opinion is above a certain critical value . in the nco model </S>",
    "<S> , each agent will convert to its opposite opinion if there are more than half of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we generalize the nco model by assuming that each agent will change its opinion if the fraction of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood exceeds a threshold @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we call this generalized model as the ncot model . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the ncot model on different network structures and study the formation of opinion clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ncot model on lattices displays a continuous phase transition . for random graphs and scale - free networks </S>",
    "<S> , the ncot model shows a discontinuous phase transition when the threshold is small and the average degree of the network is large , while in other cases the ncot model displays a continuous phase transition .    </S>",
