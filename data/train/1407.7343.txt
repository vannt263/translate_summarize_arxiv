    "since its launch occurred on february 11 2010 , the _ atmospheric imaging assembly _ in the _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo / aia ) _ has been contributing to our knowledge of solar flare emission , permitting full disk imaging in @xmath0 wavebands ( seven of which are centered at euv wavelengths ) , at a spatial resolution of about @xmath1 arcsec and with a temporal cadence of @xmath2 sec in each of the euv bands . however , the scientific potential of _ sdo / aia _ images is limited by the presence of significant saturation , which flattens and muddles the brightest , physically most interesting core of such images for even relatively modest flares .",
    "_ saturation _ refers to the condition where , in a ccd - based imaging system , pixels lose their ability to accommodate additional charge ( _ primary saturation _ ) , causing charge to spill into their neighbors .",
    "this secondary effect , named _ blooming _ , also induces bright rays typically along the north - south ( for aia ) axis in the image .",
    "we now introduce a computational method that utilizes the diffraction component of the point spread function ( psf ) of _ sdo / aia _ @xcite to recover the signal in the primary saturation region .",
    "the psf of each _ aia _ telescope models the system response to a point source and describes blurring , dispersion , and diffraction .",
    "the various _ aia _ psfs depend on the wavelength of the incoming photons and present a two - component structure which is similar to those of the _ trace _ passbands @xcite .",
    "the main idea of our approach is to exploit , in particular , the diffraction pattern showing up _ outside _ the core of the saturated image to recover information _ inside _ the saturated region .",
    "the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by previous analyses of _ trace _ and _ aia _ diffraction patterns @xcite where , however , the inverse diffraction problem is addressed by means of non - automatic , laborious and semi - heuristic procedures .",
    "our approach is based on three image - processing steps . in the first step ( _ correlation _ ) we identify the region of primary saturation distinguishing it from blooming on the basis of a data - dependent correlation procedure . in the second step ( _ convolution _ ) the diffraction fringes in the image are localized by convolving the diffraction psf with the pixels in the region of primary saturation . the third step ( _ back - projection _ )",
    "is used to reconstruct the true image in the primary saturation region using the information contained in the diffracted images .",
    "details about these steps are given in section 2 .",
    "section 3 illustrates the performances of the method in the case of _ sdo / aia _ data recorded during the july 8 2013 event .",
    "our conclusions are offered in section 4 .",
    "the general model equation mimicking the signal formation process in an optical system is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the measured data , @xmath5 is the global psf , @xmath6 is the true flux distribution , and @xmath7 is the background .",
    "this equation applies to all points in the data image .",
    "however , in the case of the _ sdo / aia _ image reconstruction problem the use of this equation should account for the fact that    * the true image can be recovered just in a sub - domain of the field of view ( fov ) corresponding to the primary saturation region ; * since the total diffracted image is very intense , the usable data , @xmath4 , is just the one containing the diffraction pattern ; * just the diffraction component of the psf is useful for this operation .    in fact ,",
    "the psf associated with each _ sdo / aia _ wavelength can be realistically modeled as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the core , gaussian - like component mimicking diffusion , and @xmath10 is the diffraction component wherein about @xmath11 of the total flux is coherently scattered due to the two square wire grid meshes supporting the thin euv filters .",
    "figure [ fig : psf ] shows the psf of the @xmath12 passband with , superimposed and rotated of @xmath13 deg , the one of the @xmath14 passband ( we applied a threshold in order to show the diffraction patterns over the full range of the fov ) .",
    "the figure points out the presence of 8 arms of diffraction for each passband , how diffraction scales with wavelength and how dispersion in the diffraction peaks scales with respect to dispersion in the core .",
    "the diffraction component of the psf plays a crucial role in the de - saturation process described in this section .",
    "the workflow of such a process is illustrated in figure [ fig : ingredients ] for a flare occurring on july 8 2013 , measured at @xmath12 ( more details on this event will be given in section 3 ) .",
    "the computational steps at the basis of its realization are :    * correlation .",
    "* let us denote with @xmath15 the overall saturation domain in the _ aia _ image in the top left panel of figure [ fig : ingredients ] .",
    "@xmath15 is the sum of the primary saturation region @xmath16 and the blooming region @xmath17 and all its pixels have intensity of around @xmath18 dn pixel@xmath19 .",
    "such pixels are masked away to obtain the image @xmath20 represented in the top right panel of figure [ fig : ingredients ] .",
    "the back - projection matrix @xmath21 is the transpose of the diffraction matrix @xmath22 and has size equal to the number of unsaturated pixels times the number of saturated pixels .",
    "we computed the correlation map @xmath23 for all pixels in @xmath15 , and show it in the middle left panel of figure [ fig : ingredients ] .",
    "since primary saturation is identified by those pixels in @xmath15 for which @xmath24 is high , a thresholding procedure allowed the identification of @xmath16 in the correlation map .",
    "* convolution .",
    "* the white curve in figure [ fig : ingredients ] , middle right panel , bounds the domain @xmath16 in the observed saturated image where information can be recovered by means of image reconstruction .",
    "we computed the convolution between @xmath16 and @xmath22 to localize the diffraction fringe in @xmath20 and utilized just that information , indicated with @xmath4 in the reconstruction procedure .",
    "in fact @xmath4 contains pixels where the diffraction effect is most significant .    * back - projection . *",
    "the reconstruction of information in the region of primary saturation @xmath16 required the computation of the back - projection @xmath25 where @xmath6 is defined in @xmath16 and here @xmath21 has size equal to the number of pixels in the diffraction fringes times the number of pixels in the primary saturation region .",
    "the result is the de - saturated image at the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : ingredients ] where the blooming effects are still present , the diffraction pattern is clearly visible and the recovery of information in the region originally affected by primary saturation is evident .",
    "such a recovery of information is even more evident in the last , bottom right panel of the figure , a zoom on the de - saturated domain .",
    "we note that the use of the log scale better shows the presence of the diffraction fringes with respect to the reconstructed signal .    from a computational viewpoint , the correlation map @xmath24 in ( [ correlation - map ] ) and",
    "the back - projected map @xmath6 in ( [ back - projection ] ) have been obtained by applying expectation maximization ( em ) @xcite to @xmath20 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "em ( also known as the lucy - richardson method in this context @xcite ) realizes maximum likelihood in the case of poisson data and imposing positivity on the solution space ( ccd data are more correctly quasi - poisson but em effectiveness relies more on positivity than on the way data - prediction discrepancy is computed ) .",
    "em iteration in the back - projection case is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the unit vector and @xmath7 is an estimate of the background . in our implementation ,",
    "the stopping rule that avoids numerical instability is based on the concept of constrained residual @xcite and imposes that the empirical value of this random variable coincides with its expectation value @xcite .",
    "we point out that for bright saturated images which are intrinsically small , diffraction places almost perfect copies over the fringes of the eight separate arms . in this case , the back - projection side - lobes are unambiguously removed and the formulation becomes a version of 2-d epoch - folding completely analogous to 1-d pulse synthesis @xcite .",
