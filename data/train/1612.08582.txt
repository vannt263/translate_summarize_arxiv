    "this larger energy range corresponds to the broad maximum observed in ref .",
    ", however , it appears at slightly lower scattering energy and thus corresponds better to the theoretical prediction ( see below ) .",
    "the additional two parameter regions with maximum fom are located around 42  ev and @xmath65 .",

    "this range of scattering energy can thus also be used for independent determination of @xmath45 and @xmath44 . however , the lower absolute asymmetry values and lower reflected intensities necessitate longer acquisition times . on the other hand ,",

    "the measured asymmetry for spin polarization @xmath45 reveals a smooth transition from a symmetric ( 0.75  a ) to an antisymmetric ( -2.5  a ) behavior .",
    "the asymmetry behavior becomes symmetric at 0.75  a ( 0.03  mt ) indicating the compensation of the longitudinal stray field component of 0.03  mt .",
    "+ by a current of -2.5  a ( 0.14  mt ) the asymmetry shows the odd behavior expected for polarization component @xmath44 . the transversal spin polarization has rotated by 90 degrees .",

    "conversely , for @xmath45 the scattering will be symmetric for azimuthal angles @xmath75 or @xmath74 .",

    "the three scattering conditions require a magnetization reversal of magnetic samples in order to generate the asymmetry via the initial beam polarization inversion .",
    "however , it is also possible to apply the vectorial spin analysis concept to non - magnetic samples . here , six scattering conditions are needed to measure three asymmetries via the variation of scattering energies and azimuthal angles .",

    "<S> we report on spin- and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy using a high - resolution imaging spin filter based on a large ir(001 ) crystal enhancing the effective figure of merit for spin detection by a factor of over @xmath0 compared to standard single channel detectors . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we review the spin filter preparation , and its lifetime . the spin filter efficiency is mapped on a broad range of scattering energies and azimuthal angles . </S>",
    "<S> large spin filter efficiencies are observed for the spin component perpendicular as well as parallel to the scattering plane depending on the azimuthal orientation of the spin filter crystal . </S>",
    "<S> a spin rotator capable of manipulating the spin direction prior to detection complements the measurement of three observables , thus allowing for a derivation of all three components of the spin polarization vector in multichannel spin polarimetry . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results nicely agree with spin - polarized low energy electron diffraction calculations based on a fully relativistic multiple scattering method in the framework of spin - polarized density functional theory . </S>"
