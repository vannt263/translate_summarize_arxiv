    "recent theoretical studies show that the of pairing can also be stabilized in a bulk , if we reconsider some conditions which are usually assumed in the theory of conventional superconductors .",
    "namely , the sign arising from the of pair potential @xmath0 , which causes the thermodynamic instability , can be canceled by introducing an additional sign .",
    "one of the solutions is to re - examine the conjugate relations of the frequency - dependent pair potential @xcite . using a path - integral formalism",
    ", it has been shown in refs",
    ".   and that the problem can be resolved by using an unusual conjugate relation for pair potential , and consequently a description based on hermitian mean - field hamiltonian is impossible . subdominant even - frequency pairings induced in inhomogeneous systems such as surface or defect have been classified for this kind of of pairing based on symmetry arguments @xcite .",
    "with this situation , however , recently josephson junctions have also been studied by fominov _",

    "we explain how",
    "the of pairs in tckl give the ordinary diamagnetic meissner effect , although the odd - frequency superconductors have long been considered to give a paramagnetic meissner kernel . while the numerical calculation @xcite shows the diamagnetic response , here we discuss it by focusing on the structure of the meissner kernel and do not enter the details . following the derivation in ref .",
    ", only the anomalous part contributes to the meissner kernel @xmath3 which can be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an electric charge , and we define the velocity @xmath6 along the @xmath7-direction .",
    "we have also introduced the ` daggered ' anomalous green function by @xmath8 . from hermiticity of the hamiltonian",
    ", we have the relation @xmath9 this relation can be explicitly shown by using the spectral representation .",
    "we assume the inversion symmetry in the original lattice : @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider the conventional spin - singlet @xmath11-wave ( ef ) superconductor as a reference .",
    "the anomalous green s function has the structure in the form @xmath12 here we do not have to know the detailed functional form of @xmath13 . the orbital degree of freedom is not included here .",
    "the meissner kernel is then given by @xmath14 for the velocity we have the relation @xmath15 , which gives the minus sign .",
    "in addition , another sign comes from the spin factor @xmath16 , and hence in total the electromagnetic response is diamagnetic : @xmath17 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we had @xmath11-wave spin - triplet of superconductivity , there would be no sign from spin - factor .",
    "hence in this case the sign of the meissner kernel is reversed to give a paramagnetic response ( or sometimes called negative meissner effect ) . for @xmath1-wave superconductors ,",
    "the minus sign comes from spatial part , i.e. @xmath18 , instead of spin part .",
    "now we consider the kernel in tckl .",
    "substituting eq .   into eq .  , we obtain @xmath19 although the factors from spin and orbital parts give the minus sign as @xmath20 , the sign operates twice and does not affect the total meissner kernel . for the velocity , we have @xmath21 originating from @xmath22 , which gives no minus sign in contrast to the above @xmath11-wave spin - singlet superconductor .",
    "we further transform the expression in terms of ef and of pair amplitudes @xmath23 originating from eqs .   and .",

    "this point has also been numerically demonstrated in ref .  .",

    "while we have no staggered phase here , the additional minus sign comes from the spin - dependent velocity .",
    "thus we have explicitly demonstrated that the staggered nature is not the only way to stabilize of superconductivity .",
    "in this section we consider a tunneling conductance in normal metal ( n)/superconductor ( s ) junction , where s is a superconducting tckl in one dimension .",

    "the josephson coupling is expressed by odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath11-wave ( otee ) and odd - frequency spin - singlet @xmath11-wave ( oseo ) pairing .",
    "then , the first - order contribution with respect to @xmath175 vanishes .",
    "thus we obtain consistent results with numerical calculations for a chain discussed above .",
    "next we discuss the above josephson junction from symmetry point of view .",
    "originally , the oseo+esoo pairs are present in tckl without any field as discussed in sec .  iii .",
    "on the other hand , for spin - singlet @xmath11-wave superconductor the esee pair and the induced osoe pair are present at the edge . in a similar manner",
    "the etoe and induced otee pairs exist for spin - triplet @xmath117-wave superconductor .",
    "thus , no symmetries match between tckl and the other superconductors , and the first - order coupling in josephson junction becomes zero .",
    "in fact , this vanishing current persists to higher orders .",
    "to explain this behavior , we must specify the component of orbital - triplets in @xmath11- and @xmath117-wave superconductors .",
    "in the present setup , since we do not include the orbital degrees of freedom explicitly , the triplet component is identified as @xmath176 or @xmath177 and no @xmath178 component .",
    "thus the mismatch between orbital - singlet in tckl and orbital - triplet ( @xmath179 ) in @xmath11- and @xmath117-wave superconductors gives exactly zero current in the present system .    with the tunnel matrix in the setup ( i ) ,",
    "the spin - orbital symmetry breaking is present and the induced pair is otee+etoe according to tab .",
    "[ tab : induced_pair ] .",
    "hence , the first - order josephson coupling survives for @xmath117-wave superconductor / tckl junction , but it vanishes for @xmath11-wave superconductor / tckl case . similarly , with uniaxial pressure in the setup ( ii ) , the esee+osoe pairs are newly generated at the edge of tckl , where orbital - triplet component include @xmath176 .",
    "hence the first - order contribution to josephson current becomes nonzero for tckl / spin - singlet @xmath11-wave superconductor junction .",
    "since we rely only on the symmetry of cooper pairs , the above discussion should be applicable also to systems in higher dimensions .",
    "finally we make a comment on the effect of a barrier potential @xmath62 at the junction part ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the phase @xmath165 dependence of the currents with repulsive and attractive potentials are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_current ] .",
    "the functional forms are not influenced qualitatively by the sign of @xmath62 , since the barrier potential does not create any new species of cooper pairs .",
    "in addition , we do not observe the difference between @xmath105 and @xmath103 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with results in the n / s junction : the sign of the barrier potentials does not affect the behaviors in the low - energy limit as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conductivity2 ] .",
    "we have investigated the staggered of pairing realized in tckl from a symmetry point of view . although the pair potential is purely odd function with respect to time ( frequency ) , both of and ef components of pair amplitude are present due to the absence of translational invariance even in the bulk .",
    "the existing pairs in bulk are identified as primary oseo and secondary esoo .",
    "we have also shown that a local gauge transformation changes the staggered state into uniform one with spin - symmetry broken state .",
    "the mechanism for the diamagnetic meissner effect has been explained by focusing on the symmetry of pair amplitude and structure of the meissner kernel .",
    "in addition to time / spin / space / orbital structures of cooper pairs , the finite center - of - mass momentum , which affects the sign of the velocity , plays an important role for diamagnetic response .",
    "the n / s junction has been constructed and it is shown that the normal reflection is always present in addition to andreev reflection .",
    "this behavior is in contrast with ordinary bcs superconductors , where only the andreev reflection is observed for high transmissivity limit .",
    "the difference lies in the presence of normal self energy in the superconducting state of tckl . due to a finite density of states ,",
    "the transmittance into tckl is also nonzero even at low energies .",
    "hence the bound state at e.g. superconducting vortex core is unlikely to be formed .",
    "when we consider the barrier potential at the interface , the conductance shows the difference between attractive and repulsive potentials , although no such difference is observed in conventional superconductors .",
    "we have also investigated the josephson junction using green function formalism .",
    "we connect tckl both with spin - singlet @xmath11-wave and spin - triplet @xmath117-wave pairing states . here a uniaxial pressure effect is considered for tckl , which is naturally expected at the edge of real materials . for tckl / spin - singlet @xmath11-wave superconductor junction , the relative phase @xmath165 dependence of josephson current becomes @xmath181 .",
    "it becomes @xmath182 for tckl/@xmath117-wave superconductor junction , where no first - order coupling appears .",
    "these josephson currents can be qualitatively described by a zero - dimensional system .",
    "the symmetry of the pairs induced at the edge is a key ingredient to understand the current phase relations of josephson junctions .",
    "this work was financially supported by a grant - in - aid for jsps fellows ( grant no .",
    "13j07701 ) , a grant - in aid for scientific research on innovative areas `` topological material science '' ( grant no .",
    "15h05853 ) , and a grant - in - aid for scientific research b ( grant no .",
    "15h03686 ) .",
    "we consider the simple two - site model given by @xmath183 where @xmath184 here @xmath121 and @xmath122 simulate the edge of the @xmath11-wave superconductor and tckl , respectively .    the tunnel matrix is given by eq .  , and the current is simply defined by @xmath185 we can solve this model analytically , which helps us understand the basic properties of josephson junction .",
    "we define the green function @xmath186 the first component of this vector is relevant to current .",
    "its fourier transformation @xmath187 satisfies the equation @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the constant vector and @xmath190 the other contributions to current can also be calculated in a similar manner . from the above equations ,",
    "we can obtain eq .  .",
    "for the special case with @xmath191 and @xmath192 , namely without any symmetry breaking fields , the green function matrix @xmath193 becomes diagonal .",
    "correspondingly , the anomalous parts in the second term of the eq .  , which is relevant to higher - order josephson couplings , are effectively dropped from the equation and the josephson coupling terms vanish in general .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the results discussed in sec .",
