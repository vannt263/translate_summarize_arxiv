    "the cross section depends on two form factors , electric @xmath11 and magnetic @xmath12 . from measurement of the cross section",
    "we determine the effective form factor @xmath13 it should be noted that such a definition was used in all previous measurements made with assumption that @xmath11 is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath11 terms in the differential cross section have different angular dependencies , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the ratio of the form factors can be extracted from the analysis of the proton angular distribution . at threshold @xmath16 , and the angular distribution is uniform .    the process @xmath0 is studied during 40 years  @xcite .",
    "however , all data before recent babar  @xcite and cleo measurements  @xcite had an accuracy of 20 - 30% .",
    "the statistics was not sufficient to determine @xmath17 ratio from angular analysis .",
    "more precise results were obtained in the inverse reaction @xmath18  @xcite . in ps170 experiment  @xcite at lear",
    "the proton form factor was measured near threshold .",
    "a steep near - threshold mass - dependence was observed .",
    "the @xmath11 to @xmath12 ratio was measured with about 30% accuracy and was found to be compatible with unity . above 3 gev/@xmath2 measurements were performed at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "the strong decrease of the form factor was observed which agrees with the dependence @xmath19 predicted by qcd for asymptotic proton form factor .",
    "recently , very precise measurement of the form factor was performed on about 1.4 fb@xmath3 data collected by cleo at 3.77 and 4.17 gev  @xcite .",
    "the initial - state - radiation ( isr ) method is used at babar to measure the @xmath0 cross section . in the isr reaction @xmath20 the photon",
    "is emitted by the initial electron or positron .",
    "the mass spectrum of the @xmath1 pair is related to the cross section of the nonradiative process @xmath0 .",
    "the isr photons are emitted predominantly along beam axis .",
    "there are two approaches in isr measurements : tagged or large - angle ( la ) isr , when the isr photon is required to be detected , and mainly small - angle ( sa ) untagged isr . only about 10% of the isr photons can be detected at babar calorimeter .",
    "the produced @xmath21 system is boosted against the isr photon .",
    "due to limited detector acceptance , the @xmath6 region below 3 gev/@xmath2 can be studied only with detected photon . above 3 gev/@xmath2 statistics",
    "can be significantly increased with the use of sa isr .",
    "the advantage of the isr method over conventional @xmath4 and @xmath1 experiments is that a wide mass region is studied in a single experiment .",
    "the large - angle isr has additional advantages .",
    "the first of them is a low dependence of the detection efficiency on the @xmath21 invariant mass .",
    "measurement near and above threshold can be done with the same selection criteria .",
    "the second is a low dependence of the detection efficiency on hadron angular distributions ( in the hadron rest frame ) . for protons",
    "this significantly increases sensitivity for measurements of the @xmath17 ratio and decreases model uncertainty in the cross section measurement .",
    "here we present babar results based on analysis of 469 fb@xmath3 data collected at @xmath4 c.m .",
    "energy near 10.6 gev .",
    "both la isr events  @xcite and sa isr events  @xcite have been used for analysis .",
    "the selection of @xmath22 candidates requires detection of two charged tracks of opposite charge originating from the interaction region and identified as protons . in la isr events a photon with the energy higher than 3 gev is additionally required . for each la isr candidate",
    "a kinematic fit with requirement of total energy and momentum conservation is performed .",
    "the final selection is based on a condition on @xmath23 of the kinematic fit . for sa isr candidate the selection",
    "is based on two parameters : the transverse momentum of the @xmath1 pair , and the invariant mass of the system recoiling against @xmath1 .",
    "both parameters should be close to zero .",
    "the dominant source of background in the la case arises from @xmath24 events with an undetected low - energy photon , or with merged photons from the @xmath25 decay .",
    "this background is estimated using a control sample of @xmath24 events .",
    "its level is found to change from 5% near threshold to 50% at 4 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "all observed @xmath26 candidates with the mass greater than 4.5 gev/@xmath2 are consistent with @xmath27 background .",
    "the contribution of other background processes is estimated to be about 1% of selected data events .",
    "the dominant background sources in the sa isr case are the isr process @xmath28 and two - photon @xmath1 production .",
    "the background level is estimated to be about 5% and subtracted .",
    "from the measured @xmath1 mass spectrum we obtain the @xmath0 cross section and the proton effective form factor . in the mass region under study , the cross section changes by 6 orders of magnitude , from about 1 nb at the @xmath1 threshold to about 1 fb at 6 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the measured effective form factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in comparison with existing @xmath4 and @xmath1 data .",
    "our data are in reasonable agreement with previous measurements everywhere except near - threshold region , where the babar results are systematically larger than the ps170 data  @xcite .",
    "the measured mass dependence of the ratio @xmath29 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] . to measure the ratio the distribution of @xmath30 is analyzed , where @xmath31 is the angle between the proton momentum in the @xmath1 rest frame and the momentum of the @xmath1 system in the @xmath4 c.m",
    "the measured ratio is higher than unity at masses below 2.2 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "our results disagree with the previous ps170 measurement  @xcite .    we have also searched for an asymmetry in the proton angular distribution .",
    "an asymmetry is absent in the lowest order ( one - photon @xmath1 production ) .",
    "it arises from higher - order contributions ( soft extra isr and fsr interference , two - photon exchange ) .",
    "the integral asymmetry for events with @xmath1 mass below 3 gev/@xmath2 is found to be consistent with zero : @xmath32     cross section in the mass regions near 2.2 ( left ) , 2.5 ( middle ) , and 3 ( right ) gev/@xmath2 .",

    "the growth of the form factor near threshold as well as the deviation of the ratio @xmath29 from unity may be due to final - state interaction between the proton and antiproton  @xcite . at higher energies the form factor and cross section display a steplike mass dependence with three steps near 2.2 , 2.5 , and 3 gev/@xmath2 .",

    "our data shows that the form factor decreases in agreement with the asymptotic qcd prediction .",
    "the decrease may be even faster above 4.5 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the local deviations of the `` nu '' points from the global fit may be result of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 resonance contributions .",
    "the points marked `` slac 1993 '' represent data on the space - like magnetic form factor measured in @xmath39 scattering  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic values of the space- and time - like form factors are expected to be the same . in the mass region from 3 to 4.5 gev/@xmath2 the time - like form factor is about two - three times larger than the space - like one . the new babar data at high masses give an indication that the difference between the time- and space - like form factors decreases with mass increase .",

    "the form factor has complex mass dependence .",
    "there are a near - threshold steep falloff and a step - like behavior at higher masses . at masses above 3 gev/@xmath2",
    "the observed decrease of the form factor agrees with the asymptotic dependence predicted by qcd or is even faster .",
    "the @xmath29 ratio has been measured from threshold to 3 gev/@xmath2 . a large deviation of this ratio from unity is observed below 2.2 gev/@xmath2 .",
