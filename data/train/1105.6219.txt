    "bott @xcite studied matrix - valued periodic sturm - liouville operators and proved a version of the above theorem . to our best knowledge",
    ", the case of jacobi matrices with matrix - valued entries was first considered in our prior work @xcite .",
    "it contained only separated left and right boundary conditions and , in particular , the case of @xmath8 .",
    "this result is recalled in section  [ sec - transfer ] . to round things up ,",
    "section  [ sec - hamiltoniansys ] briefly shows how the very same techniques can be applied to hamiltonian systems and thus provides an alternative proof of the result of bott @xcite .",
    "the main reason why we believe that the present proof considerably simplifies prior ones is the following : the boundary conditions are ( hermitian ) lagrangian planes and these lagrangian planes can be identified with the unitary matrices ( proposition  [ prop - diffeo ] ) .",
    "for the spectral problem , one is then led to study the intersection of the formal solutions of the schrdinger equation with the boundary conditions .",
    "the intersection of two lagrangian planes can easily be read off the spectrum of the associated unitaries ( proposition  [ prop - wronski ] ) .",
    "the bott - maslov index of a path of lagrangian planes counts the number of these intersections and can thus simply be defined by looking at the spectrum of the associated unitaries ( section  [ sec - index ] ) .",
    "the path relevant for the eigenvalue problem of @xmath8 is given by the energy dependence of lagrangian planes naturally associated to the solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath56 .",
    "for the study of the periodic operators @xmath19 , one also needs the bott or conley - zehnder index of a path of hermitian symplectic matrices . but",
    "using a variant of the graph of each such matrix ( which is also lagrangian ) this index is just a special case of the bott - maslov index in doubled dimension ( section  [ sec - index ] ) .    many of the facts about intersection theory of lagrangian planes and symplectic paths are well - known ( even though in general stated for real symplectic and not hermitian symplectic structure ) , but the consequent use of the identification of lagrangian planes with unitaries leads to a particularly intelligible and compact presentation below .",
    "the first such intersection theory seems to be due to bott @xcite and was developed precisely for the eigenvalue problem of matrix - valued sturm - liouville operators , see section  [ sec - hamiltoniansys ] .",
    "nevertheless , the theory is nowadays most often associated with maslov , due to his contributions @xcite .",
    "conley and zehnder considered paths of symplectic matrices and defined their index @xcite , but this could also be considered a further development of bott s ideas .",
    "a spectral flow definition of the index is due to robbin and salomon @xcite .",
    "extensions , further geometric applications as well as a nice review on the indices as well as eigenvalue problems are given by long @xcite .",
