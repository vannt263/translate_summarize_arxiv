    "we begin by making two observations which will be used later .",
    "first suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that there is a component of @xmath107 whose closure @xmath108 is @xmath94-fibered . since @xmath86 is contained in @xmath0 , @xmath98 is a product of a surface cross an interval where the ends of the product are in one or two components of @xmath106 .",
    "since @xmath7 is 3-connected , removing the vertices corresponding to these components and the edges containing them does not separate @xmath7 . also , there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices and no edge from a vertex to itself .",
    "it follows that there are precisely two annuli in @xmath109 , and hence these annuli must be parallel in the product .",
    "since this contradicts the minimality of @xmath97 , no components of @xmath107 are @xmath94-fibered .",
    "next consider an annulus in @xmath97 whose boundary components are in a single @xmath110 , and suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that its boundaries are non - isotopic curves in @xmath111 .",
    "thus the surface between these two curves in @xmath110 intersects @xmath7 . also , since the annulus is incompressible in @xmath112 , the disjoint disks bounded by the curves in @xmath110 each intersect @xmath7 .",
    "it follows that the sphere obtained by capping off the annulus with these two disks separates @xmath7 and each component contains at least one vertex other than @xmath64 .",
    "since this contradicts the 3-connectedness of @xmath7 , the boundary components of such an annulus must be isotopic in @xmath111 .",
    "we now consider the locally knotted edge @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath79 and @xmath80 be the vertices of @xmath6 and choose a ball for a local knot of @xmath6 whose boundary meets @xmath81 in the disks @xmath113 and @xmath114 . by removing these disks",
    "we obtain an annulus which is incompressible in @xmath86 .",
    "it now follows from jsj that there is an isotopy of the pair @xmath115 taking this annulus to an annulus @xmath57 which has boundaries in @xmath82 and @xmath83 and is contained either in @xmath97 or in a seifert fibered component of @xmath107 .",
    "consider the case where the annulus @xmath57 is contained in a seifert fibered component @xmath116 of @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath117 be the disk in @xmath118 bounded by @xmath119 .",
    "it follows from the fibered structure of @xmath98 that every component of @xmath120 is an annulus .",
    "in particular , the component of @xmath120 containing @xmath121 has precisely one boundary which is in @xmath117 and is isotopic to @xmath121 in @xmath122 , and all of the other components of @xmath120 have either 0 or 2 boundary components which are in @xmath117 and are isotopic to @xmath121 in @xmath122 .",
    "since every boundary component of @xmath123 is a boundary of some component of @xmath120 , it follows that there are an odd number of boundary components of @xmath124 which are in @xmath117 and are isotopic to @xmath121 in @xmath122 .",
    "suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that every annulus of @xmath123 with at least one boundary component which is in @xmath117 and is isotopic to @xmath121 in @xmath122 has its other boundary component in @xmath82 .",
    "such an annulus has isotopic boundaries in @xmath122 , and since @xmath57 separates @xmath98 and one boundary of it is in @xmath117 the other boundary must be in @xmath117 as well .",
    "thus there must be an even number of boundary components of @xmath124 which are in @xmath117 and are isotopic to @xmath121 in @xmath122 .",
    "since we saw above that this number is actually odd , there must be some such annulus @xmath91 whose boundary component is in @xmath110 with @xmath125 .",
    "now suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that @xmath126 .",
    "consider the sphere obtained from @xmath127 by adding the annulus between @xmath57 and @xmath91 in @xmath122 together with disks in @xmath128 and @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath57 and @xmath91 are incompressible in @xmath86 , this sphere separates @xmath7 into components each containing at least one vertex of @xmath7 other than @xmath80 and @xmath64 .",
    "since this contradicts the 3-connectedness of @xmath7 , we must have @xmath129 .",
    "furthermore , if we cap off @xmath91 in @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we obtain a sphere bounding a ball which intersects @xmath7 in an arc of @xmath6 and contains the annulus @xmath57 .",
    "since @xmath7 is 3-connected , we can cap off any annulus in @xmath97 with boundaries in @xmath82 and @xmath83 to obtain a sphere bounding a ball whose intersection with @xmath7 is an arc of @xmath6 . choose @xmath5 to be maximal among all such annuli .",
    "that is , by capping off @xmath5 in @xmath82 and @xmath83 we obtain a sphere bounding a ball @xmath47 which intersects @xmath7 in an arc of @xmath6 and contains all of the other such annuli .",
    "then it follows from our argument above that any incompressible annulus in a seifert fibered component of @xmath107 with boundaries in @xmath82 and @xmath83 will be contained in @xmath47 .",
    "hence any incompressible annulus in @xmath86 with boundaries in @xmath130 and @xmath83 is isotopic in @xmath115 to an annulus which is properly embedded in @xmath131 .",
    "furthermore , if such an annulus is contained in @xmath132 , then it is isotopic in @xmath133 to @xmath5 .",
    "it follows from our choice of @xmath5 that @xmath47 is an unknotting ball for @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath134 be another unknotting ball for @xmath6 , and let @xmath58 be obtained from @xmath6 by replacing the knotted arc @xmath135 by an unknotted arc of @xmath134 .",
    "after an isotopy of @xmath8 fixing the vertices , we can assume that @xmath136 meets @xmath81 in disks in @xmath82 and @xmath83 . by removing these disks",
    "we obtain an annulus @xmath137 , which we prove as follows is isotopic to @xmath5 in @xmath115 . since @xmath134 is a ball for a local knot of @xmath6",
    ", @xmath137 is incompressible in @xmath86 .",
    "hence , by our choice of @xmath5 , we can assume that @xmath137 is properly embedded in @xmath131 .",
    "let @xmath138 be the torus obtained from the annuli @xmath5 and @xmath137 by adding annuli in @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "suppose that @xmath137 is not isotopic to @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath138 bounds a solid torus in @xmath86 , then the meridian of the solid torus does not have intersection number @xmath139 with a component of @xmath140 .",
    "however , in this case , by adding a thickened disk to the solid torus along a component of @xmath140 we would get a punctured lens space .",
    "as this is impossible in @xmath0 , we can assume that @xmath138 bounds a knot complement in @xmath86 .",
    "however , since @xmath141 , this would imply that @xmath47 is a ball for a local knot in the edge @xmath58 which is contrary to our assumption that @xmath134 is an unknotting ball for @xmath6 .",
    "therefore @xmath137 is isotopic to @xmath5 in @xmath115 , and hence @xmath134 is isotopic to @xmath47 by an isotopy of @xmath14 pointwise fixing the vertices of @xmath7 .",
    "now let @xmath9 be pairwise disjoint balls for local knots of @xmath6 .",
    "since each @xmath142 meets @xmath7 in an arc in the interior of @xmath6 , without loss of generality , we can assume that each @xmath143 meets @xmath81 in two disks contained in @xmath144 . for each @xmath33",

    "thus if some @xmath145 is not contained in @xmath47 , then there is an annulus component of @xmath148 in @xmath132 .",
    "we can extend this annulus parallel to @xmath5 to obtain an annulus in @xmath132 with boundaries in @xmath82 and @xmath83 which is incompressible in @xmath132 .",
    "hence , we can obtain an isotopy of @xmath133 taking this annulus to @xmath5 .",
    "thus we can remove any annuli from @xmath148 while pointwise fixing @xmath7 without introducing any new intersections of @xmath5 with some @xmath149 .",
    "this gives us an unknotting ball which contains @xmath150 as required .",
    "let @xmath7 be a 3-connected graph embedded in @xmath0 with locally knotted edges @xmath29 ,  , @xmath30 .",
    "then there is a collection of pairwise disjoint unknotting balls for these edges .    by theorem  1 , we know that there is a collection @xmath52 ,  , @xmath151 of unknotting balls for @xmath29 ,  , @xmath30 respectively .",
    "we see as follows that we can isotop @xmath52 ,  ,",

    "first we will isotop @xmath54 , ",
    ", @xmath151 off of @xmath52 , then we will isotop @xmath152 ,  , @xmath151 off of @xmath54 , and so on .",
    "let @xmath153 be a circle of intersection of @xmath154 with @xmath155 that bounds an innermost disk @xmath156 on @xmath154 .",
    "since there are at least two innermost disks on @xmath154 bounded by circles of @xmath157 and @xmath29 intersects @xmath154 in precisely two points , we can choose the disk @xmath158 so that it intersects @xmath29 in at most one point .",
    "similarly , we can choose @xmath159 to be a disk bounded by @xmath153 in @xmath155 which intersects @xmath53 in at most one point .",
    "since @xmath160 if @xmath161 , the sphere @xmath162 meets @xmath7 in at most two points .    by hypothesis",
    ", @xmath7 is 3-connected .",
    "thus a sphere can not meet @xmath7 in precisely one point , and if a sphere meets @xmath7 in two points then those two points must be on the same edge .",
    "since the sphere @xmath162 meets each @xmath163 in at most one point , it follows that @xmath162 can not intersect either @xmath163 .",
    "thus one component of @xmath164 is a ball which is disjoint from @xmath7 . using this ball , we can isotop @xmath159 to a disk parallel to @xmath158 by an isotopy of @xmath54 that fixes @xmath7 .",
    "this isotopy removes @xmath153 as a circle of intersection in @xmath165 .",
    "thus , by inducting on the number of circles of intersection , we can make @xmath54 disjoint from @xmath52 .",
    "since we have changed @xmath54 by an isotopy pointwise fixing @xmath7 , the new @xmath54 will still be an unknotting ball for @xmath53 .",

    "in our study of topological symmetry groups , we would like to use local knots to prevent certain automorphisms from being induced by any homeomorphism of the embedding .",
    "we begin with some more terminology .    by theorem 1 , we know that unknotting balls are unique up to an isotopy of @xmath8 fixing every vertex of @xmath7",
