    "the phenomenon of intensity scintillation ( twinkling ) of compact cosmic radio sources in the ionosphere was first identified in the 1950s and understanding it was one of the great successes of radio physics of that period .",
    "it has also been observed in the solar wind and the interplanetary plasma where it has been equally useful .",
    "the use of satellite beacons instead of cosmic sources has been very helpful in the ionospheric case particularly , especially as ionospheric scintillation can have serious consequences for our increasing reliance on satellite communication .",
    "this is not ( yet ) possible in the interstellar plasma , but recently radio astronomers discovered the `` parabolic arc '' phenomenon in dynamic spectral observations of interstellar scintillations of pulsars @xcite .",
    "these parabolic arcs are found in the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) power spectrum of the observed dynamic spectrum .",
    "this 2-d power spectrum is referred to as the secondary spectrum .",
    "the parabolic arcs prove to be an `` eigenfunction '' of the broadband forward scattering problem and have revolutionized the study of the interstellar plasma .",
    "they have not proven to be as useful in the solar wind , although they have been observed ( coles , private communication ) , probably for two reasons .",
    "first , the major axis of the solar wind irregularities is normally aligned with the flow speed .",
    "second , the inner scale of the solar wind turbulence is not very much smaller than the radius of the first fresnel zone ( as it is in the interstellar plasma ) .",
    "ionospheric scintillation has also been probed for many years using radar measurements . for this application",
    "various papers describe modelling calculations and results in which propagation through an irregular medium is detailed . @xcite and @xcite , for example , present phase screen / diffraction methods in which an electro - magnetic wave is propagated through multiple phase `` screens '' followed by a distance of free space to result in the calculation of the two - frequency , two - position mutual coherence function and its 2-d fourier transform , termed variously as the `` scattering function '' or `` generalized power spectrum '' .",
    "these 2-d model spectra also show parabolic arc structures under some circumstances , most pronounced in the case of a single thin scattering screen as seen , for example , in figure   11 of @xcite .",
    "they are seen in radar observations , though examples reviewed in preparation of the current work do not show the phenomenon very clearly ( e.g. , figure   1 in @xcite showing results from an hf channel probe in northern greenland and vhf results from an equatorial radar facility presented in @xcite ) .",
    "it has been unclear if parabolic arcs could be detected using observations of ionospheric scintillation of natural sources and we believe that the results presented in this paper represent the first ( although @xcite note `` unpublished measurements of natural equatorial scintillation at 300mhz '' without making clear the parameters studied ) . here",
    "we show that they can be observed and have the potential to provide a 2-dimensional image of the scattering plasma as well as its velocity and distance .",
    "improvements in radio technology have greatly increased the bandwidths available to radio astronomy and multi - ghz bands are now common , but multi - octave bands are not . the low frequency array ( lofar - @xcite ) , a new radio telescope centered in the netherlands with additional stations across europe ,",
    "has been the first to attempt to exploit these improvements at long wavelengths where they make possible a @xmath0-octave bandwidth .",
    "observing over such bandwidths is qualitatively different than observing a few tiny windows over a 3-octave range .",
    "long wavelength observations have become increasingly challenging due to the huge increase in wireless communications , but the resulting radio frequency interference ( rfi ) is much more easily identified ( and subsequently removed ) from a broad continuous band than from an array of small windows .",
    "this is most easily appreciated by examination of figure  [ fig : cygatwo ] , where some limited rfi is apparent at  138 and 150mhz but this does not detract from the data in neighbouring channels .",
    "broadband observations where dynamic spectra have been obtained are very few in number .",
    "@xcite observed ionospheric perturbations in decametric solar observations using the nanay decametric array and interpreted their results in terms of diffraction and focussing by large - scale ionospheric disturbances .",
    "@xcite described wide bandwidth observations of various natural radio sources using the utr-2 and uran telescopes in ukraine .",
    "this included noting ionospheric scintillation in an observation of the strong radio source taurus - a , but did not attempt any interpretation .",
    "here we describe the first wide - bandwidth ionospheric scintillation results from an observation of the strong radio galaxy cygnus - a taken in september 2012 using the kilpisjrvi atmospheric imaging receiver array - kaira @xcite , a new ionospheric observatory built using lofar technology and summarised in section  [ sec : kaira ] .",
    "these show remarkably complex refractive structures at the longest wavelengths , which are as yet unmodeled .",
    "secondary spectra ( throughout this paper we will use the term `` secondary spectrum '' in this regard ) of these data show parabolic arcs .",
    "we also demonstrate here the use of straightforward scintillation arc modeling as used in the case of interstellar scintillation @xcite , which has the advantage of ease of use for the estimation of velocity and scattering height in the case of simple parabolic arcs .",
    "results from initial modeling attempts are presented and compared with available data from other systems at the time .",
    "section  [ sec : arcs ] describes the parabolic arc phenomenon and basic theory as it has been applied in the case of interstellar scintillation , with the observations and results presented in subsequent sections .",
    "the parabolic arc phenomenon is simply outlined , although the details are naturally more subtle .",
    "the fundamental mechanism underlying intensity scintillation is the angular scattering of a plane wave incident on a thin scattering screen into an angular spectrum of plane waves @xmath1 .",
    "this angular spectrum is the distribution of power that one would observe with an imaging instrument in the receiving plane .",
    "intensity fluctuations result from interference between these scattered plane waves .",
    "the basic observable is a dynamic spectrum of intensity @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the observing frequency and @xmath4 is time through the observation , observed at a single point in the receiving plane as the spatial interference pattern drifts past the receiving antenna .",
    "the scattered plane waves each have a characteristic doppler shift and delay which depend on the scattering angle ( @xmath5 ) , the wavelength of the radiation ( @xmath6 ) , the distance ( @xmath7 ) of the scattering screen , and its velocity ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the coordinates of the secondary spectrum , which is a delay - doppler distribution , are actually differential delay and doppler between pairs of scattered plane waves . in relatively weak scintillation",
    "the first order interference is between a scattered wave and the unscattered wave , so the secondary spectrum becomes a map of the scattered delay - doppler distribution .",
    "a parabolic arc arises in the secondary spectrum naturally when one considers the delay and doppler as a function of scattering angle .",
    "the delay is given by @xmath9 and the doppler shift is @xmath10 .",
    "then @xmath11 is related to the maximum doppler shift @xmath12 by @xmath13 and the parabolic arc traces the boundary of the scattered distribution in the secondary spectrum .",
    "this boundary is quite sharp because the jacobian of the transformation from @xmath1 into the secondary spectrum has a half - order singularity at the arc . in strong scattering , where interference of two scattered waves is dominant , the map is more complex and one frequently sees a field of reverse arclets with apexes along the primary arc . for detailed theory of arc formation in weak and strong scattering",
    "as it has been applied to interstellar scintillation the reader is referred to the work of @xcite .",
    "the curvature of arcs defined in this way is @xmath6 dependent , which is not important with 10% bandwidths , but degrades the arcs significantly with octave bandwidths .",
    "fortunately one can define the rf spectrum in @xmath6 rather than @xmath14 and perform exactly the same analysis .",
    "the variable @xmath15 , defined as the conjugate to @xmath6 , is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spatial wavenumber of the scattering irregularities . in this form",
    "the doppler shift is @xmath18 .",
    "thus the arc is defined by @xmath19 and the curvature is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "parabolic arcs are much more distinct when @xmath20 so they are best observed with high signal to noise ratio and when @xmath1 has a power - law tail .",
    "they are not visible if @xmath1 is gaussian .",
    "the visibility is enhanced when @xmath1 is anisotropic and @xmath8 is aligned with the more heavily scattered axis .",
    "this is most easily shown by a simulation .",
    "we have simulated 256s blocks of the `` high band '' ( section  [ sec : kaira ] ) observations @xmath3 = 110 to 190mhz assuming the scattering is caused by kolmogorov turbulence in the f region under three conditions : ( 1 ) the scattering is isotropic ; ( 2 ) the axial ratio is 3:1 and the structures are aligned with the velocity ; and ( 3 ) the axial ratio is 3:1 but the structures are aligned perpendicular to the velocity .",
    "we show the secondary spectra in figure  [ fig : sim ] .         in the solar wind",
    "the velocity is radial and the scattering is enhanced perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "thus arcs are hard to see near the sun in quiet conditions because the magnetic field is radial .",
    "they can be seen in coronal mass ejections where the magnetic field becomes non - radial .",
    "we expect that a similar anisotropy will hold in the ionosphere , but the velocity is more often perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "a concern in the ionosphere is that @xmath1 may be truncated by an inner scale before @xmath20 , eliminating the power - law tail .",
    "conversely one potential application of this technique may be in estimating the dissipation scale of mhd turbulence in the ionosphere .",
    "the effect of the angular size of the radio source @xmath21 illuminating the ionosphere is also important .",
    "effectively it smooths the spatial diffraction pattern @xmath22 by convolution with a smoothing filter @xmath23 .",
    "this multiplies the secondary spectrum by a low pass filter and truncates any parabolic arcs .",
    "the spatial scale of the diffraction pattern in weak scattering is @xmath24 so the critical source diameter is @xmath25 . for our observations at @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the critical source diameter is 3 arc min . the radio source cygnus - a is elongated @xmath28 3 arc min in the minor axis and @xmath29 3 arc min in the major axis .",
    "we believe this is a factor in our observations .",
    "an ideal source would be @xmath28 3 arc min , but not too compact because if it is @xmath28 0.3 arc sec it will scintillate in the solar wind and if it is @xmath28 0.06 milli - arc sec it will scintillate in the interstellar plasma .",
    "such scintillations would have to be separated from the ionospheric effects of interest .",
    "choosing the right source diameter eliminates this confusion . as a practical matter only pulsars scintillate in the interstellar medium , but active galactic nuclei scintillate in the solar wind .",
    "supernova remnants and compact radio galaxies are the best choice for ionospheric scintillations .",
    "kaira consists of a dual array of antennas : a low - band antenna ( lba ) array of 48 dual - polarisation dipole antennas which covers the frequency range 1090mhz and a high - band antenna ( hba ) array of 48 tiles , each tile consisting of a phased array of 16 dual - polarisation bow - tie antennas , which covers the range 110 - 270mhz .",
    "the lba dipoles and the hba tiles are fixed in position , there is no mechanical beam steering .",
    "the lba dipoles are sensitive to the entire sky , although the sensitivity is significantly reduced below 25@xmath30 elevation .",
    "each hba tile has a 16 element analogue beam - former which creates a single tile - beam for each tile .",
    "the tile beam can be pointed anywhere inside the envelope of the dipole elements  approximately the same ranges as the lba dipoles .",
    "the analogue signals from each lba dipole and each hba tile ( both in two polarizations ) are carried to a receiver container on coaxial cables where they are amplified , filtered , digitized , separated into frequency channels , and full array - beams are formed for each channel .",
    "multiple lba array - beams can be pointed anywhere in the sky , but the hba array beams are restricted to the field of view of the tile - beam , about 43@xmath31 at 110mhz and 18@xmath31 at 270mhz .",
    "the system is extremely flexible and can be operated in many different `` modes '' .",
    "the primary filters isolate the bands 1090mhz , 110190mhz and 210270mhz .",
    "these bands are then channelized with a polyphase filter , producing 512  subbands each of width 195.3125khz .",
    "the station beam - former is then used to form up to 244  `` beamlets '' , where each beamlet is an independent pointing direction and a specified subband for an arbitrary set of antennas from either of the two arrays . as the selection of antennas used",
    "can be specified separately for each beamlet , it is possible to perform an observation covering the full available bandwidth ( 10270mhz ) by using sub - arrays of lba aerials and hba tiles .",
    "however , given the limitation of a maximum of 244  beamlets available at the time , the frequency coverage is sparse as non - continuous subbands must be selected to span the entire frequency range .    for the observations presented here ,",
    "the station was sub - arrayed into thirds to cover frequencies within each of the low - band and high - band filters used . in the low band 1090mhz we selected 100 sub - bands ( 154451 with spacing of 3 ) centered at 30.08 to 88.09mhz with spacing of 0.59mhz . in the high band 110 - 190mhz we selected 100 sub - bands ( 52448 , spacing 4 ) centered at 110.16 to 187.5mhz with spacing 0.78mhz . in the highest band 210270mhz we selected 44 sub - bands ( 52224 , spacing 4 ) centered at 210.16 to 243.75mhz with spacing 0.78mhz .",
    "frequencies above 244mhz are heavily contaminated by rfi and so not regarded as useful in regular observations .      in september 2012 ,",
    "a series of test observations were carried out with the kaira station in which the strong radio source cygnus - a was observed in overnight observations of , typically , 12 hours in length .",
    "here we concentrate on the night of 25 - 26 september 2012 .",
    "the 17 minute section shown in figure  [ fig : cygatwo ] is typical of the entire period . since the scintillation time scales are typically 3 to 30 s , it is not possible to display the dynamic spectrum of the entire observation with enough resolution to see the structures .",
    "the two higher bands show scintillations that are highly correlated over frequency as is characteristic of weak scattering .",
    "the low band shows the onset of strong scattering and an obvious change in the lower part of this band to intensity structures with a much longer time scale and which decorrelate significantly in frequency .",
    "intensity structures with very short time scales are superposed on these long time scale structures .",
    "this combination of time scales is indicative of a strong scattering regime where diffraction through small - scale density variations occurs alongside refraction through much larger - scale density structures which cause lensing effects leading to strong focussing and de - focussing of the radio source . for further details the reader",
    "is referred to , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the dynamic spectra of the first 10 blocks of these two bands are shown in figure  [ fig : dyn1 ] .",
    "the data in the low band above 80mhz is too heavily filtered to avoid contamination from the fm waveband to be of use so we truncated that band at 80mhz in computing secondary spectra .",
    "the low band spectra require more manual editing for rfi and we have not attempted to match them with the high band spectra because of the 30mhz gap .",
    "one can see that the scintillations are almost constant over the band although they vary rapidly with time .",
    "however there is fine structure on the scintillations , illustrated in figure  [ fig : dynzoom ] , and it is this fine structure that causes the parabolic arcs in the secondary spectra .",
    "we show @xmath32 and the time scale @xmath11 , calculated as the mean period between intensity peaks in the scintillation pattern , from the mid - band in figure  [ fig : index_scale ] .",
    "the solid blue lines are from 110149mhz and the dashed red lines are from 149188mhz .",
    "one can see that both @xmath33 and @xmath11 are quite variable .",
    "we believe that the variations in @xmath33 reflect real variations in the level of turbulence , but that the spatial scale is relatively stable so the variations in @xmath11 reflect variations in velocity .",
    "the scintillation index @xmath34 throughout all three bands , but we believe that it would have exceeded unity in the low band were it not suppressed by the angular size of cygnus - a .",
    "a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this paper because both the scattering and the source structure are anisotropic , and the source structure rotates with respect to the ionospheric structure during the observations , so a full 2-dimensional analysis is required .",
    "this will be carried out in a future work .",
    "the secondary spectrum can be computed from the dynamic spectrum using a 2-dimensional fourier transform @xmath35|^2 $ ] . since the sampling in @xmath36 is regular an fft can be used .",
    "however the spectrum is quite red and we find that best results are obtained by : pre - whitening @xcite the dynamic spectrum with a first difference on both axes ; augmenting the pre - whitened dynamic spectrum with equal numbers of zero samples on both axes ; performing the 2-d fft ; taking the squared magnitude ; and finally post - darkening to correct for the pre - whitening .    as noted earlier , with the octave bandwidth of these observations it would have been better to compute the spectra in equal wavelength channels . since that can not be done post - facto we have defined 100 equally spaced wavelength channels @xmath37 , calculated the corresponding frequency @xmath38 , and interpolated in the dynamic frequency spectrum to obtain @xmath39 .",
    "we then compute the modified secondary spectrum @xmath40|^2 $ ] using the fft exactly as discussed earlier . here",
    "@xmath15 is the conjugate variable to @xmath6 and has units cycles / m .",
    "the effect of using equal @xmath6 channels is easily seen in figure  [ fig : chan ] .",
    "this is a relatively complex secondary spectrum from the 6th block of figure  [ fig : dyn1 ] which shows two interlaced parabolic arcs .",
    "the top two plots in this figure show secondary spectra from high- and low - band parts of this block , and the lower two plots show secondary spectra from the same parts , but resampled to steps of equal @xmath6 .",
    "the arcs are much better defined after resampling . here",
    "one should note that switching from equal @xmath3 to equal @xmath6 sampling reverses the doppler axis .",
    "steps and the bottom in equal @xmath6 steps from the same set of data .",
    "note that switching between @xmath3 and @xmath6 sampling reverses the doppler axis .",
    "these spectra show two interlaced arcs , most visible in the lower right plot .",

    "note that switching between @xmath3 and @xmath6 sampling reverses the doppler axis .",

    "the shortest sample interval that can easily be obtained with the kaira receivers is 1s .",
    "higher resolution is possible but requires the use of significant processing and data storage resources which were not readily available at the station at the time of these observations .",
    "this is not always sufficient to capture the doppler shifts , as can be seen in two examples ; the high band secondary spectra for blocks 3 and 10 of figure  [ fig : dyn1 ] which are shown in figure  [ fig : sec1 ] .",
    "the left panel , block 3 , has a relatively high velocity and the doppler shift exceeds the nyquist frequency at the right margin .",
    "the aliasing is clear because in 2-dimensions the delay ( or @xmath15 ) continues to increase when the doppler @xmath14 is aliased . in the right panel , block 10 , the velocity is considerably lower and the entire parabola is well sampled .",
    "various time ranges of the dynamic spectra were used as input for calculating secondary spectra to investigate which ranges might be optimal ; a time range of 256s represented a reasonable balance between ability to represent accurately the periodicities in the data and reflecting changes in these periodicities .",
    "we kept the high and low bands separate because the sampling rate was quite different , although they could have been analyzed together .",
    "we did not use the 44 channels of the top band because it would have left a large gap in the spectral range and the additional signal would not add any further information to the scintillation arc structure in the secondary spectra .",
    "parabolic arcs were observed in the first half of the data , but were much weaker in the second half and not observable after the time scale dropped at about 02:30 ut .",
    "note that the examples shown here have the character of the right panel of figure  [ fig : sim ] , i.e. the structure is elongated ( presumably along the magnetic field ) perpendicular to the velocity vector .",
    "this was the case for the early data , but after about 21:00 ut the secondary spectra look much more like the left panel of figure  [ fig : sim ] , or even a bit like the middle panel .",
    "the structure appears more isotropic or slightly anisotropic but aligned parallel with the velocity vector .",
    "example blocks 30 and 52 at 21:12 and 22:48ut are shown in figure  [ fig : sec_iso ] .",
    "we believe that this is caused by the rotation of cygnus - a with respect to the ionosphere : it is an elongated source whose long axis will have become more aligned with the local horizon as the source moved into the western sky through the latter part of the observation .",
    "the source then begins to truncate the high angle scattering caused by the anisotropic microstructure making the scattering appear more isotropic .",
    "the objective of this analysis is to show that we have detected parabolic arcs in ionospheric scintillation and that they are consistent with the other ionospheric measurements available .",
    "we will not attempt a complete model fitting at this time , however we note that model fitting in the weak scintillation case is much simpler than in the strong scintillation regime as shown in appendix d of @xcite . indeed one can further simplify the broad - band analysis by normalizing the dynamic spectrum @xmath41 vs @xmath6 , which one would normally do anyway because the radio source flux will vary with @xmath6 . in the normalized case",
    "the `` narrow band '' expression ( d5 ) of @xcite applies even to a broad band .",
    "we also note that the effect of the finite size of the cosmic radio source illuminating the ionosphere will have to be included , as shown in their equation ( d10 ) .",
    "we have accurate radio images of cygnus - a from interferometry so this correction is feasible .    in the following",
    "we will restrict our modeling to the parabolic arc itself , rather than to the entire secondary spectrum .",
    "we fit only the observations where we have complementary ionospheric observations and we fit only the blocks for which the best fit is obvious by eye .",
    "the arc should be a well - defined boundary between pure noise and scintillation , regardless of the axial ratio of the structure .",
    "the arc defined by @xmath19 has curvature @xmath42 .",
    "we find that it is common to see an arc for which @xmath43 , a phenomenon which is caused by a large scale phase gradient which shifts the image of the radio source @xcite .",
    "we have included @xmath44 in the fit but we use only @xmath45 in the analysis .",
    "examples are blocks 3 and 10 which are shown in figure  [ fig : sec1 ] .",
    "the velocity can also be estimated from the time scale if the spatial structure is isotropic or if the major axis is perpendicular to the velocity .",
    "the latter case appears to be true up to about 23:00 ut and this is also the region for which it is easiest to estimate the location of the parabolic arc .",
    "we assume that the fresnel scale is @xmath46 and use estimated velocity @xmath47 .",
    "we plot the velocity determined from the parabolic arcs , for cases where a fit could be made , and the spatial scales averaged over the high band in figure  [ fig : vel ] . in both cases , we assume a distance along the line of sight to the scattering screen of 350 km .",
    "we choose the region between 19:46 and 20:12ut to compare with other ionospheric observations because the velocity is relatively stable .",
    "block 10 , which is shown in figure  [ fig : sec1 ] is at the start of this interval and is typical of the other blocks .",
    "table  [ table : arcfits ] gives the fitted values for blocks 10 - 16 corresponding to this time range .",
    "the arcs seen in this time range are , however , relatively `` thick '' , indicating scattering through a thick layer . for some plots they appear almost to be visible as two separate arcs ( as illustrated in figure [ fig : chan ] ) , an issue which is addressed in section [ sec : timeres ] .",
    "the model fits given here represent average curvatures in such cases .",

    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]          any natural radio source is not stationary in the sky , but appears to move across the sky as the earth rotates .",
    "cygnus - a is a circumpolar source at these latitudes .",
    "therefore to compare these data with other observations it is necessary to assess the approximate location of the ionospheric region giving rise to the scintillation . to do this",
    ", we assume a peak f - region height of 300 km and use this height to estimate the geographic location of a `` pierce point '' of the line of sight through the ionosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : map ] shows a map giving the locations of this point , calculated hourly for times from the start of the observation at 19:00ut ( eastern - most point ) , in the line of sight ( labelled as `` cygnus - a '' ) .",
    "the location of the second point from the east corresponds to 20:00ut and , as the central time of the range for which we model the scintillation arcs , is the location used to compare with data from other observatories .",
    "unfortunately , there are no ionospheric observatories lying close enough to this point to provide a direct comparison , so only a general comparison can be made .",
    "horizontal velocities in the ionosphere across the auroral regions are measured regularly by the super dual auroral radar network ( superdarn  @xcite , @xcite ) . since these radars measure doppler velocities only in the direction of the radar beams , they are most useful if the fields of view of two or more radars cover the region to be probed .",
    "the field of view of the hankasalmi radar in finland fully covers the area of ionosphere probed by the modelled scintillation measurements and the southernmost beam of the pykkvibaer radar in iceland covers an area down to approximately 0.5@xmath30 in latitude to the north of the region of interest . taking this latter area ,",
    "indicated on the map given in figure [ fig : map ] , velocity time series have been obtained using the davit web tool for superdarn data currently hosted by virginiatech ( http://vt.superdarn.org/tiki-index.php?page=davit+tsr ) . taking the closest area where a reasonable number of velocity points are available from both radars , the corresponding beams and range gates for each radar are beam 4 , gate 13 of the hankasalmi radar and beam 15 , gate 36 of the pykkvibaer radar .",
    "gaps in the time series were interpolated across using a linear gradient between the measured velocities on either side of the gap .",
    "a correction was applied to the velocities to account for the estimated index of refraction , following the work of @xcite .",
    "the index of refraction , @xmath48 , can be calculated using the plasma and radar frequencies , @xmath49 and @xmath14 respectively using the basic formula , @xmath50 .",
    "information available using the range - time plotting function of the davit tool ( http://vt.superdarn.org/tiki-index.php?page=range+time+browse ) indicates that both hankasalmi and pykkvibaer were operating at a frequency of 10mhz at the time .",

    "the azimuths , measured eastwards from north , of the boresites of each of these beams are 336.66@xmath30 for hankasalmi and 57.54@xmath30 for pykkvibaer . using these angles the velocities from each radar were combined into velocity magnitude and direction .",
    "the resulting velocities and directions are given in figure [ fig : superdarn ] .",
    "the troms  dynasonde @xcite , based at the european incoherent scatter ( eiscat , @xcite ) radar site at ramfjordmoen in norway , produces a number of ionospheric parameters including velocity vectors . although it is not very close to the region of interest here ( as shown in figure  [ fig : map ] )",
    ", it is the closest such instrumentation which was operating at the time and gives an idea of the prevailing ionospheric conditions in the region .",
    "figure  [ fig : dynasonde ] presents plots of the horizontal velocities in the f - region , and the f - layer peak height for the times of interest .",
    "the dynasonde also produces data for the vertical velocity and similar data for the e - region .",
    "the vertical f - region velocity was approximately zero at the time .",
    "further information on the density structure of the ionosphere at this time can be obtained from ionospheric tomography data .",
    "sodankyl geophysical observatory operate a chain of ionospheric tomography receivers across finland and sweden , with the highest latitude station at kilpisjrvi , close to kaira . this chain recorded satellite passes at 19:47ut and 20:33ut on 25 september 2012 , with the satellites following paths a little to the west of the coast of norway and over the finland / russia border respectively",
    ". plots of these tomographic reconstructions ( the reader is referred to @xcite for a description of the inversion process ) , using a chapman function as regularization profile @xcite , are given in figure [ fig : tomo ] .",
    "the reconstructions indicate maximum density at approximately 400 km and demonstrate a possible lowering of the overall electron density between 19:47 and 20:33ut , but otherwise no significant change in the overall structure of the ionosphere over this time frame .          given the external velocity measurements of superdarn and the troms  dynasonde , it is possible to use the scintillation arc curvatures to estimate the height of the dominant scattering `` layer '' .",
    "however , the velocity which is used in modelling the scintillation arcs is the result of both movement of the ionosphere and movement through the ionosphere of the line of sight to the radio source , and is sensitive only to any direction perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "it is first sensible to define co - ordinates in the reference frame of the line of sight :    @xmath55 : horizontal with respect to the local horizon , positive clockwise .",
    "@xmath56 : vertical with respect to the local horizon , positive upwards .",
    "@xmath57 : within the line of sight and therefore not used .",
    "the velocity of the line of sight is itself naturally dependent on the distance used .",
    "calculations show that it is of the order of 25ms@xmath58 assuming a distance of 350 km , so is comparable in magnitude to the velocities measured by the radar systems at the time and can not be neglected .",
    "we assume also that the velocity component due to the ionosphere is horizontal ( i.e. , parallel to the ground plane ) : this is a reasonable assumption given that superdarn only measures horizontal velocities and the troms  dynasonde data give no reliable indication of any significant vertical velocity component .    the velocity of the line of sight can be stated in terms of an assumed distance along it and the angle through which the radio source moves within the time covered by each data block .",
    "using also the change in elevation of the radio source enables the velocity of the line of sight to be stated in terms of horizontal and vertical components , as given in equations [ eqn : vsrchoriz ] and [ eqn : vsrcvert ] :    @xmath59    @xmath60    where @xmath7 is the distance , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the @xmath55 and @xmath56 components of the angle through which the radio source moves , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the change in elevation .",
    "the ionospheric velocities measured by radar have been translated into magnitudes , @xmath65 , with directions given in terms of azimuth measured eastwards from north , @xmath66 .",
    "the x and y components of ionospheric velocity can then be calculated with relation to the azimuth , @xmath67 , and elevation , @xmath68 , of the line of sight :    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    the total transverse velocity can then be stated as :    @xmath72    taking the arc curvature model as given in section  [ sec : arcfit ] ( @xmath73 where @xmath45 is the arc curvature ) and combining with equations [ eqn : vsrchoriz ] to [ eqn : perpvel ] , a quadratic equation in terms of @xmath7 can be formed :    @xmath74    equation [ eqn : lquadratic ] is solved using the standard quadratic equation and distances calculated for each block using both superdarn and dynasonde velocities . using the negative root of the standard quadratic equation results in distances of @xmath75  0 , so",
    "distances were calculated using only the positive root .",
    "the calculated distances have been converted into altitudes and plotted in figure  [ fig : scatheights ] .",
    "it can be seen that the altitudes calculated from the superdarn velocities are within the f - region , but most are significantly higher than the peak height measured by the troms  dynasonde .",
    "there was no real - valued solution to the quadratic equation for one of the superdarn velocity points .",
    "the dynasonde velocities indicate rather higher altitudes in general .",
    "the altitudes of peak f - region density measured by the troms  dynasonde can be used themselves as an estimate of the dominant altitudes of the scattering and so combined with the scintillation arc modelling to estimate a range of possible ionospheric velocities perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "the basic @xmath73 is used to calculate velocities in this instance but , as described in section [ sec : scatheight ] , this velocity contains components from both the ionosphere and the movement of the line of sight to the radio source through it .",
    "the latter can be calculated but , since these components are vectors ( as detailed in equation [ eqn : perpvel ] ) , both the speed and direction of the ionospheric component would need to be estimated .",
    "however , it is not possible to obtain both pieces of information from this simple model ; equation [ eqn : lquadratic ] can be re - arranged in terms of the magnitude @xmath65 or the azimuth direction @xmath76 but it is not possible to calculate both .",
    "therefore we can only look at the magnitudes and estimate a range of possible speeds .",
    "the magnitude of the line of sight velocity , @xmath77 is calculated from equations [ eqn : vsrchoriz ] and [ eqn : vsrcvert ] as @xmath78 . given the unknown direction of the ionospheric velocity relative to this , adding and subtracting this number from the modelled @xmath8 will give the maximum and minimum possible values for @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the results of this exercise are given in figure [ fig : minmaxvel ] .",
    "in this figure the calculated overall velocity @xmath8 is plotted as a blue solid line . also plotted are @xmath65 velocities calculated assuming the velocity directions given by the superdarn and dynasonde data , using equation [ eqn : lquadratic ] re - arranged in terms of @xmath65 and solved for the positive root using the standard quadratic equation . using",
    "the negative root resulted in negative velocities whereas this parameter , as derived here , is a magnitude .",
    "three possible ranges of @xmath65 are shown , calculated assuming three different sets of altitudes . from the tomography density plots , we estimate a minimum and maximum likely altitude for the scattering as 200 km and 600 km respectively .",
    "these values represent the altitudes at which the density has dropped to approximately half of its peak value . in figure",
    "[ fig : minmaxvel ] , the narrowest range ( shown in the darkest blue ) was calculated assuming scattering from the lowest altitude and the widest range ( shown in the lightest blue ) was calculated assuming scattering from the highest altitude .",
    "the middle range was calculated assuming altitudes equal to the f - layer peak height measured by the troms  dynasonde .",
    "a number of the arcs in blocks 10 - 16 show some broadening which could be interpreted as the superposition of two arcs with slightly different curvatures .",
    "such a scenario could indicate scattering from different altitudes and/or with different velocities , or it can indicate that the 256s block length averages over slight changes in conditions . there is little evidence for the former scenario in this case , leaving the latter to be considered .",
    "to do so , the block length was reduced as low as 64s .",
    "although this reduces the signal - to - noise ratio of the secondary spectra , the scintillation arcs are still readily apparent and do indeed appear narrower and more clearly defined .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : arcs64s ] which presents a comparison between the original secondary spectrum for block 16 and spectra for the individual 64s blocks which comprise it .",
    "the comparison demonstrates clearly that the broadening of the scintillation arcs is due to changing conditions through a single 256s block and not a simultaneous superposition of scattering regimes with different altitudes and/or velocities .",
    "the calculated scattering altitudes and possible velocity range for the 64s blocks are given in figure  [ fig : scatdetails64s ] .",
    "these were calculated using the original superdarn data ( i.e. , before the averaging of every four points for the 256s blocks ) and dynasonde data padded to account for the 2-minute cadence of the original data .",
    "the scattering altitudes show some substantial variation within the f - region , only sometimes becoming as low as the altitude of the peak of the f - region , suggesting that the scattering is more dominated by the topside ionosphere .",
    "the velocity ranges shown are as described in section [ sec : scatvel ] .",
    "although the overall range of possible velocities is quite high , they do confirm that the velocity is most likely to be well under 100ms@xmath58 .",
    "we present the first multi - octave low frequency observations of ionospheric scintillation , using the kaira station .",
    "these show in dynamic spectra the evolution of the scattering regime from weak scatter at the highest observing frequencies to strong scatter and the effects of refraction by large - scale density structures in the ionosphere at the lowest frequencies observed .",
    "the secondary spectra , as calculated from the 2-d fft of the dynamic spectra , often show an arc structure similar to the `` scintillation arcs '' noted in observations of the interstellar scintillation of pulsars . here , we apply the basic scattering theory developed for this latter case to our observations of ionospheric scintillation to estimate velcocity perpendicular to the line of sight to the radio source and the altitude(s ) dominating the scattering .",
    "since these parameters are linked in the modelling , it is necessary to use other observations to provide estimates of one so that the other may be calculated . in this case , velocities measured by superdarn and the troms  dynasonde are used .",
    "however , neither of these are exactly coincident with the region being probed by the scintillation observations . nevertheless scattering altitudes consistent with the f - region",
    "are found when modelling the scintillation arcs using the horizontal ionospheric velocities measured by superdarn and the troms  dynasonde . in some cases",
    "these match the peak altitude of the f - region , as measured by the dynasonde .",
    "however , in most cases the scattering altitudes appear higher than this peak , indicating that the scattering may be dominated more by the topside ionosphere .    estimating ionospheric velocities using this technique",
    "is more complex as it involves the estimation of two parameters , the magnitude and direction , which are , again , inherently linked in the modelling and require knowledge of one for the other to be calculated .",
    "nevertheless , a range of possible velocity magnitudes can be calculated given the scattering altitude .",
    "the range is , however , broad and in the results presented here can only confirm that the velocity is most likely to be below 100ms@xmath58 .    in this paper",
    "we give only an example of the analyses which can be performed with broadband data such as these .",
    "while we have been able to use a simple model here to obtain estimates of altitudes dominating the scattering and ionospheric velocities , it is clear that more information could be obtained if a full scattering model is applied",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .    with the densely - packed core of stations in the center of the lofar array it is possible to do more .",
    "observations already taken using the lofar stations demonstrate that ionospheric scintillation is readily apparent at these frequencies , even at mid - latitudes . with the main lofar core , it is possible to use temporal cross - correlation between time series recorded by indivdual stations to estimate ionospheric velocities to feed into modelling of scintillation arcs seen in the secondary spectra .",
    "data have already been taken and will be the subject of future work .    also of particular interest is the work of @xcite in which radio astronomy imaging techniques have been combined with secondary spectrum analyses to measure accurately the locations of an image of a pulsar , scattered by the interstellar medium . applying this technique to observations using the lofar core offers the prospect of `` imaging '' ionospheric scintillation for the first time .",
